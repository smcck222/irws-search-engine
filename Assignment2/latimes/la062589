In "Keeping Manson Behind Bars" (May 14), Martin Kasindorf wrote: "Outraged 
middle-class values have reasserted themselves, quite literally with a 
vengeance." This statement reveals a lot more about the attitudes of the author 
than it does about society. To attribute outrage over sadistic attacks on 
innocent people to "middle-class values" is to side with the fundamental 
assumptions of the Manson point of view. 
</P>
<P>
Tell me, in which social class in America is sadistic murder regarded as 
acceptable?

As an alumnus of Deep Springs College, I want to commend Thomas J. Meyer and 
Max Aguilera-Hellweg for "School on the Range" (May 14). In both words and 
photographs, they allowed the place and people to speak for themselves, and 
kept to a minimum the stereotypic interpretations inevitable of "outsiders."

It is true. A picture is worth a thousand words. The picture on the cover of 
Charles Manson brought forth many words for me: insensitivity, cruelty, 
manipulation, powerlessness, barbarity, persecution -- the list goes on. What a 
way to start Mother's Day.

G'BYE CALIFORNIA, G'DAY AUSTRALIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN MITCHELL, Sean Mitchell's last story for this magazine was a profile of 
writer Joseph Wambaugh. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a clear, blue, ocean-scented morning in Sydney, a day like so many others 
when the sidewalk cafes in Kings Cross have their awnings out for breakfast, 
the joggers are loose in the Royal Botanical Gardens and no one is sleeping 
nearby in a cardboard box, it's possible to see that California is no longer 
the end of the line. The search for the good life and the new life that for 150 
years carried millions of restless Americans across the continent to the West 
Coast has in recent years carried some of them farther, 7,500 miles and 15 
hours by air farther, into the southern hemisphere, to Australia. 
</P>
<P>
Settled 200 years ago by the same stock of Anglo-Irish criminals and political 
dissidents King George III had been shipping off in servitude to the American 
colonies, Australia has always been a distant cousin, both strange and 
familiar. Maligned in the past as a rude wilderness of kangaroos and 
ale-slobbering rugby players, the country has become increasingly attractive to 
Americans as more of them turn their gaze backward in pursuit of happiness. To 
Californians, Australia can look like only yesterday, a thinly populated, 
eucalyptus-lined frontier of manageable cities, unspoiled hills andbeaches far 
from the smog, mini-malls, freeway shoot-outs and desperation of their own lost 
paradise. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Consulate official in Sydney estimates that there are 80,000 to 90,000 
Americans living in Australia. Although the consulate doesn't compile such 
statistics, a good percentage of them are known to be Californians, drawn by 
the same visions of adventure, economic opportunity, peace of mind and 
wide-open space that once lured their parents or grandparents to Los Angeles 
and San Francisco. Australia is a country the size of the United States with 
the population (16.5 million) of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 10 years ago, the Australian government was offering to help 
finance passage to its remote island continent for immigrants with proven 
skills -- teachers, doctors and businessmen. Those days are over. Such 
inducements are no longer necessary given the country's rising profile, boosted 
lately by the America's Cup races, the romantic hokum of "Crocodile Dundee" and 
the 1988 Australian Bicentennial celebration. The Australian Consulate in Los 
Angeles receives about 5,000 travel and emigration inquiries a month from 
residents in Arizona, New Mexico and Southern California, the last of which 
accounts for a majority of the 670 immigrant visas it grants each year. 
Although the government still holds seminars in America for wealthy businessmen 
considering migration, for the average person it's not a simple matter to gain 
residency. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a lot are trying. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 1 million people worldwide applied to immigrate to 
Australia, and the government accepted 140,000, making it just about as easy as 
getting into Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a comfortable place to get very far away," said Becky Robertson, who 
moved to Sydney this year from San Gabriel with her two young daughters, Sarah 
and Carly, and her husband, John, formerly a software engineer with the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. His technical skills landed him a job with 
the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, a government 
agency, although the application process took a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
The Robertsons, both in their 30s, went to Australia partly to escape the 
incidents of daily violence in Los Angeles that they felt were hitting closer 
and closer to home. "I feel so much safer here," Becky Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Family issues were one of the main reasons we left," said John Robertson, 
sipping a can of Foster's Lager in their still-undecorated living room. 
"Australia is very family-oriented. I had a negative image of what's going to 
go on in the U.S. in the next five years, and I wanted to protect my family 
from that." 
</P>
<P>
They feel safe enough in their rented $1,200-a-month (in Australian dollars, 
$900 in U.S. dollars), three-bedroom house in the northern suburb of Lane Cove 
not to lock their doors at night. 
</P>
<P>
"It appealed to us," Becky Robertson said, "that everyone said it was 30 years 
behind the times. I was reassured that it wouldn't be considered outmoded to 
stay home with the kids." 
</P>
<P>
She hasn't been disappointed. "You don't get the impression that every kid is 
being shipped off to day care. Here, a woman isn't proving anything to anyone 
by having a career." 
</P>
<P>
Greatly impressed by the friendliness and informality of the people, she 
mentioned that as she was walking to the local shopping center, a motorist 
stopped and offered her a ride. 
</P>
<P>
"God, it's so innocent!" 
</P>
<P>
MORE THAN a few Californians who've taken up residence in Australia make 
comparisons between their adopted land and the California they remember before 
the Watts riots, the influx of millions of political refugees from Latin 
America and Asia, the clogging of the freeways, the pollution of coastal waters 
and the emergence of gangs. So, in spite of Australia's declining standard of 
living -- the result of an ailing economy and an imbalance of trade -- and its 
unfolding pollution and crime problems, expatriates feel as if they've turned 
back the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Standing at the edge of a national park in Noosa Heads, in Queensland, 600 
miles up the coast from Sydney, Los Angeles-born Gordon Clements, stared out 
over the burgeoning town and said, "My parents bought a house in Manhattan 
Beach in 1952 for $9,000. I thought, 'When am I going to be able to afford 
this?' I wanted to live on the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Clements, 36, who looks like the archetypal tanned and blue-eyed California 
surfer, was once co-owner of a delicatessen in Manhattan Beach. He sold out to 
his partner and moved to Australia "on a lark" in 1978. "I remember that first 
day in August I arrived in Noosa. It looked like paradise. The surfing was 
good, the sky was blue, the beer was cold and there were all these naked girls 
on the beach. I thought, 'Why should I leave here?' " 
</P>
<P>
He arranged to return the following year, under a temporary work visa, to coach 
a water polo team at the University of Queensland in Brisbane. Eventually, he 
went to work as a carpenter, at one point hiring out to a construction crew in 
the remote Outback where he ate the famous red dust of the bush and lived in 
military-style barracks. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he supervises a crew of 40 carpenters building hotels and petrol 
stations in Noosa Heads, a developing tropical resort where the ocean 
temperature in the winter is the same as it is in Los Angeles in the summer. He 
has built himself a 2,800-square-foot house near a golf course, where it's not 
uncommon to see kangaroos on the greens. He tells his Australian wife, Joanna, 
"This is what Manhattan Beach was 30 years ago. It's going to grow up around 
us." 
</P>
<P>
A thousand miles across the country in Adelaide, a serene city of Victorian 
parks, cathedral spires and 1 million people that faces the Southern Ocean, Ron 
Somers led the way into his back yard to show off George and Martha, the pet 
wallabies he and his wife bought since resettling six years ago. "We feel like 
we're in a bit of a time warp. It's like California in the '50s," said Somers, 
41, a public-health official who grew up in the Fairfax district and went to 
UCLA. "Kids wear school uniforms. You're not afraid to go out at night. You go 
to a national park here and have the place to yourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, he and his 35-year-old wife, Pam Rachootin, were employees of 
Kaiser-Permanente in Los Angeles, "making good incomes, and we still couldn't 
touch housing." 
</P>
<P>
They left Los Angeles first for Denmark, where both of them worked on a 
three-year grant; then Somers heard about a university research job in 
Adelaide. Neither of them had been to Australia before, but he took the job, 
and Rachootin enrolled in medical school for free (nearly all education in 
Australia is free) and became a physician. Soon after they arrived, the couple 
bought a four-bedroom house with a red-tile roof, half a mile from the beach, 
for $80,000 Australian. 
</P>
<P>
"We're living in a more manageable environment here," said Somers, who's since 
moved on to a position with the state of South Australia as a specialist in 
accident prevention. "We've been out of the country for 10 years now, and in 
that time we've seen such changes in Los Angeles that it's become less and less 
of a magnet to draw us back." 
</P>
<P>
"The last time we were back," Rachootin said of their visit to West Los 
Angeles, "we were shocked to see armed guards at our old supermarket." 
</P>
<P>
Although Adelaide is a quiet city of vestigial English character, its physical 
layout, between the ocean and a ridge of golden brown hills, and its mild 
climate are reminiscent of Los Angeles. "After Denmark," Rachootin said, "we 
almost felt like we were going back home when we came here." But emigres from 
the West Coast are surprised when they learn how different the culture really 
is. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a first-world Mexico," said Phil Tripp, a former tour manager for rock 
bands in the United States who now lives in Sydney, a metropolis of 3 million 
spread out on an 18th-Century grid across low hills surrounding one of the 
world's great natural harbors. "It's manana-land. People here don't live to 
work; they work to live." 
</P>
<P>
WALK INTO A clothing store on Oxford Street in Sydney's fashionable Paddington 
district and chances are that no clerk will pounce on you with a phony smile. 
On the other hand, neither is anyone likely to offer much assistance if you 
want to buy something. Order an omelet of green peppers and mushrooms at one of 
those sidewalk cafes in Kings Cross and you might get, without apologies, 
cheese and ham (or was it Spam?). 
</P>
<P>
American tourists can be disconcerted by the Australians' lackadaisical 
attitude toward service, and American businessmen can be dismayed to learn that 
financial success in Australia is still viewed with a touch of disdain. The 
latter is traceable to the country's founders -- downtrodden working-class 
settlers who, in the words of Sydney's best-known playwright and screenwriter, 
David Williamson, "despised success because it could be achieved only by 
ingratiation and betraying your mates." 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa restaurateur Dennis Bramnick, 38, and his wife, Cathy, traveled to 
Sydney last year with $1.4 million to open the first of a proposed chain of 
"California Southwest" cuisine restaurants, and found that doing business in 
Australia has required adjusting to its powerful unions, heavy taxes (a rate of 
46% for incomes of $35,000, for instance), inflexible state bureaucracy and 
different work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a country of Victorian attitudes and archaic laws," Bramnick said over 
lunch at a sunny brasserie on Bayswater Road. He admitted good-naturedly that 
he has done his share of "whingeing," an Aussie term for complaining. 
</P>
<P>
A self-described "loner and adventurer open to new situations," Bramnick had 
hoped to have his first Red Onion restaurant operating by now but was slowed by 
tedious lease negotiations, training a staff and winning reluctant government 
approval to add another American to his payroll. Just as Gordon Clements 
discovered that, with holidays and vacation time, his Australian carpenters 
actually work 43 weeks out of the 52 they are paid for, Bramnick learned that 
Australian waiters don't work for tips (the whole concept is slightly foreign) 
and are paid time and a half on weekends. All Australians, including 
dishwashers, are guaranteed by law a minimum of four weeks' annual paid 
vacation, even in the first year of a job. 
</P>
<P>
Bramnick also has done battle with his Australian chef over how the food is 
going to be prepared. "His attitude is that he knows what Australians want," 
Bramnick said about his chef, whom he sent back to California for additional 
training. "My point is, how can they know what Mexican food is here when 
they've never really had good Mexican food?" 
</P>
<P>
Australians traditionally have been as eager to accept new ideas as they have 
been to cultivate good service. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to say, 'Get your act together. This place could be paradise.' But 
you can't do that. You can't act American and get aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
This is a country, after all, where many people still celebrate Queen 
Elizabeth's birthday. There may be no more glaring example of Australia's 
collective lack of initiative than its continuing failure to declare 
independence from Great Britain, despite widespread uneasiness over its 
Commonwealth status and lingering resentment against the "Pommies," or resident 
English. 
</P>
<P>
But traditions aside, Bramnick remains optimistic that he and other 
Californians can find success. "If you go down to the Circular Quay," he said, 
referring to a section of the waterfront, "and you look at cars and the houses, 
you know people are making a lot of money despite the taxes." 
</P>
<P>
MANUEL NILA, the "Tortilla King" of Sydney, hasn't done too badly for himself. 
Born and reared in East L.A. and a former hairdresser, Nila quit the real 
estate business in Los Angeles 16 years ago and moved to Australia in search of 
something better. "I was bored. I felt I had gone as far as I could go there," 
said the 58-year-old expatriate, who first became aware of Australia while 
working as an Air Force control-tower operator in the South Pacific after World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
The government helped pay the passage for him, his wife and three children in 
1973. Beginning with one tortilla machine, he launched Senor Nila Mexican Food 
Products, catering primarily to Sydney's handful of Mexican restaurants. Now 
divorced and married to an Australian and living in a hillside home with a pool 
in the northern suburbs, he grosses more than $1 million a year and supervises 
a staff of eight. Senor Nila's logo is a koala squatting on a sombrero. 
</P>
<P>
If Nila wanted to resettle in Australia today, he would have to apply for 
residency status, as Bramnick did, under Australia's business migration 
program. The program requires that an entrepreneur bring at least $500,000 
Australian (and presumably new jobs) into the country. It's one of the four 
main routes to residency still open to foreigners. The others are to marry an 
Australian, possess professional skills deemed desirable by the government 
(such as pastry chef, speech pathologist, cabinetmaker, furniture polisher, 
accountant, plumber) or be recognized as a political refugee. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Wissert got in because of who he is: a well-known record producer who spent 
20 years in Los Angeles working with The Lovin' Spoonful, Boz Scaggs, Earth, 
Wind &amp; Fire and other major artists. Three years ago, he bought a townhouse 
in Sydney's quaint, leafy Woollahra district and began recording Australian 
performers such as Ganggajang, Cal and Raging Waters. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt things were becoming kind of staid for me. I felt I needed a change," 
Wissert said one morning in Sydney, surrounded by his collection of big, bright 
contemporary oil paintings. "I've always been looking for new ideas, new places 
to be. I had an interest in the country on a lot of different levels and got 
excited when I found out there's a lot going on in music here that's not really 
getting out. 
</P>
<P>
"There was certainly the ecological aspect of things -- the life style. I 
didn't want my children to wake up in the middle of the night with nightmares. 
And I certainly didn't want to go to New York. I almost went to Nashville." 
</P>
<P>
Wissert, 42, said he has gained a new perspective on the world and his own 
business by relocating. 
</P>
<P>
"Going into the clubs, there isn't so much of a scene as in L.A., where, if you 
go to see a band, there are 100 attorneys and 100 publicists. We live on a 
smaller scale. Not that it isn't as competitive in a certain way, but there 
isn't all that hype. I think when they opened up the Hard Rock Cafe here, they 
tried to present a bit of that (status-mongering), and it didn't really work. 
Here, even if you have a Top 10 record, you have to wait in line like anybody 
else." 
</P>
<P>
In Wissert's profession, the migration traditionally has been in the opposite 
direction. But he said, "People don't realize they have such a great country 
here. They tend to ask me, 'Why did you come here from the States?' And I say, 
well, 'If you were born in America, then you'd look at it differently.' " 
</P>
<P>
Phil Tripp, another refugee from American rock 'n' roll, liked the country so 
much after sailing into Sydney Harbor on an ocean liner in 1980 that he has 
become an Australian citizen and a defender of its "no worries, mate" level of 
ambition. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the people in Australia," he said, leaning back in a desk chair at his 
home/office in Sydney's scruffy Chippendale district. "They're not pretentious. 
They're honest and they're lazy." 
</P>
<P>
An Army brat from the South who moved to Malibu after he entered the music 
business, Tripp spent eight years as a production assistant and tour manager 
with rock performers such as Stevie Wonder and Rick James and helped produce 
campaign concerts for Jimmy Carter the year he lost the presidency to Ronald 
Reagan. That same year, Tripp decided that he no longer wanted to live in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The last straw was the Rick James tour in 1980, when we had a shooting in the 
audience," said Tripp, a beefy, rhapsodic man of 38 who now promotes and 
manages bands in Sydney. "The cocaine, the guns, the whole racial thing -- it 
all just jelled at that one concert. I began making a study of all the 
countries in the world I could move to. I wanted a country that had no nuclear 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
His research led him to Australia, an English-speaking democracy at a safer 
distance from the United States (and warmer) than Canada and with a similarly 
insignificant military establishment and strict gun laws. 
</P>
<P>
The murder rate in Australia is 1.77 per 100,000, or about 283 homicides 
nationwide in one year, contrasted with the 832 murders recorded last year in 
the city of Los Angeles alone. 
</P>
<P>
"There's tremendous personal freedom here," Tripp said, reaching for his 
wallet. He pulled out his driver's license and displayed it. It was a plain 
piece of paper with a few numbers on it but with no picture or other personal 
data. "The government is big, but it's unobtrusive. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing about America is to be bigger and better. Here, it's laid-back and 
classless. Being here made me realize how performance had always dictated my 
sense of who I was. In Australia, I found my spirituality. In America, I never 
had time to." 
</P>
<P>
Of the many virtues Tripp has found in Australia's welfare state, he ranks none 
higher than the national health insurance, which costs its citizens a little 
more than 1% of their gross income. "I had a heart attack two years ago. I was 
in the hospital for 10 days, and it cost me $180." 
</P>
<P>
TO THE NEW arrival from California, Australia offers its own array of 
head-scratching contradictions, beginning with a political terminology that 
defines its Liberal Party as the equivalent of the United States' Republicans. 
But perhaps none of the contradictions is as striking as its street-level 
commitment to egalitarianism and "fairness" combined with its history of racism 
and sexism. Until the early 1970s, immigration was largely restricted to white 
Anglo-Saxons, and the country's treatment of its dark-skinned aborigines was an 
unseemly facsimile of the American neglect of Indians and blacks. 
</P>
<P>
A series of reforms erased the notorious "white Australia" policy and restored 
land rights to the aborigines, improving if not ending their longstanding 
impoverishment. Less progress has been made in repairing the nation's lingering 
reputation as an island of old-fashioned male privilege. Women, both natives 
and new arrivals, still complain about the men. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Falcone, who grew up in Long Beach as the daughter of Mexican and Italian 
parents, moved to Australia in 1971 after meeting an Australian woman who told 
her "there were five men for every woman." "Little did I know what Australian 
men were like," she said with a pinched smile during a conversation outside a 
nightclub in Byron Bay, a surfing town of 18,000 people south of Brisbane on 
the central coast. 
</P>
<P>
Falcone, 43, a waitress and cashier, has found much to admire about the country 
("It's still acceptable to roam around here; you don't have to do the same 
thing for 20 years") but does not count the men among its assets. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what she missed about California, she answered, "I miss how well-mannered 
the men are and all the grade-A junk food -- Mexican food that tastes good and 
Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. It's too 'WASPy' here." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Woolley, also 43 and single, a Sydney book publisher and a graduate of 
Hollywood High, offered a different account of the storied male chauvinism. 
"The men are friendlier, less restrained from saying what they really think," 
she said. "They're less polite. There's terrible sexism, but there is in 
America, too. It's not that different." 
</P>
<P>
Woolley, who moved to Australia from Los Angeles in 1970 partly in reaction to 
the Manson murders, preferred to talk about the political education she has 
received and the global perspective she has gained while living in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents were Republicans. I never thought about socialism or communism. It 
just wasn't talked about. Here, I found that people talked about what these 
things mean. I'm 'left' now. I'd vote for the Labor Party if I could vote." 
</P>
<P>
Her company, Wild and Woolley, begun in 1974 in partnership with Australian 
novelist Michael Wilding, publishes new Australian fiction and serious 
nonfiction. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans in the book trade don't look beyond America," Woolley said. "They 
don't see themselves as part of the world." 
</P>
<P>
THE HARDEST thing for Americans to get used to here is the Australian political 
system," said Ric Zuckerman, an associate professor of Russian history at the 
University of Adelaide. "The politicians here are people. The premier of South 
Australia (who is like a state governor) lives in an ordinary neighborhood and 
drives an ordinary car, and you bump into him in the market." 
</P>
<P>
Zuckerman, 44, taught for three years at San Jose State during the mid-'70s but 
lost his job to budget cuts. He was thinking about becoming a librarian when he 
heard about the Adelaide position at a party in Berkeley. "I applied on a 
whim," he said. "I didn't even know where Adelaide was." 
</P>
<P>
Looking up from a desk covered with exam papers he was grading in his 
fourth-floor campus office, the professor recalled: "There was no one in 
Australia at the time who could do this job, but I had a hell of a time getting 
in, so it wasn't easy even then. I underwent a grilling -- there's no other 
word for it -- at the consulate in San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
Finally awarded his working visa, Zuckerman and his Los Angeles-born wife, 
Lorre, 43, headed for the unknown. "The first year was terrible," he said. "We 
got very homesick." 
</P>
<P>
But after the first year, things began to look up. He found the university, 
which has 8,000 students, to be "as good as most good state universities in the 
States, and we don't have the bottom 20%. We don't have the dregs." 
</P>
<P>
"Our personal lives have been outstanding. We actually have leisure time 
together. We live 15 minutes from the water, and I have a 20-foot boat. If I 
was an academic in California, I'd be lucky to own a rowboat." 
</P>
<P>
His 10-year-old son, Michael, has become a cricket player, "a left-handed spin 
bowler, and he's very good," said his father, an umpire in the same league. 
</P>
<P>
"Australians recognize that the joy of doing something is more important than 
the talent to do it. The concept of amateurism is much greater here than in the 
U.S. There are no athletic scholarships to college, and pro athletes make 
nothing by comparison," Zuckerman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Zuckermans, who also have a 7-year-old daughter, Nicola, are happy in 
Australia but have not given up their American citizenship. Like many 
expatriates, they visit their families every few years and haven't ruled out 
the possibility that they might one day return to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Others, like Colin Heaney, have already discovered that they can't go home 
again. Heaney, a glass blower of custom vases and tableware, traveled to 
Australia in search of adventure and good surfing after graduating from Pomona 
High School in 1967. He surfed Sydney's beaches, "lived in sheds for years" and 
survived on part-time jobs. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to California in 1972, to Santa Cruz, and began making good money 
selling candles and furniture. But, he said, "as soon as I arrived back in the 
States, I knew I couldn't live there anymore. There were too many people 
mainly. It was just a matter of time until I could get the money together to 
get back." 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, he was standing barefoot, dressed for work in shorts and a tank 
top. He had just returned from an afternoon surfing break to his cinder-block 
studio on the outskirts of Byron Bay, a former whaling village with inhabitants 
that include retired California surfing heroes Rusty Miller and George 
Greenough. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that happens heaps," Heaney said. "People live here awhile and they 
try to go back, and then they end up back here again." 
</P>
<P>
What he missed when he returned to the United States, he said, was "the slower 
pace of life" he had grown accustomed to in Australia, and the lack of emphasis 
on materialism. 
</P>
<P>
"The money here is never what I could make in California. In California, I 
found that it was easy to impress women with money, but it doesn't impress 
people the same way here." 
</P>
<P>
Now 41, Heaney is married to an Australian he met on a dance floor in Byron 
Bay. They have a daughter, and he's building a house on a piece of beachfront 
property he bought several years ago for $37,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a patriotic person," he said when asked if he still had any emotional 
attachment to the United States. "I'm not comfortable with the emotions 
associated with patriotism." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Somers, the public-health specialist in Adelaide, had explained the 
giddiness many expatriates experience just after they've made the move: "The 
first few months here, you're on a mental holiday anyway. But eventually, the 
euphoria wears off, and after a few years you can bounce into a depression, 
coming to grips with the reality that there is no place like home and that you 
will never be a native. Weighing the advantages and the disadvantages, I'm 
personally convinced of the advantages. But people go back at all stages." 
</P>
<P>
On one of those clear, blue mornings in Sydney, a visitor from Los Angeles 
fixed on one of the hypnotic harbor views is reminded of what Somers said and 
is tempted to see how long the euphoria might last. Maybe Australia is what 
California used to be, but with kangaroos and socialized medicine instead of 
coyotes and movie moguls. For the Southern Californian who's seen one limo too 
many, Australia can indeed be a comfortable place to get very far away. Here, 
people ride in the front seats of cabs next to the driver. And they call him 
"mate." 
</P>
<P>
But the visitor realizes, too, that moving here would require a bigger 
adjustment than remembering the Liberals are the party on the right and that 
Christmas comes in mid-summer. There is the realization that the flip side of 
Aussie egalitarianism is a leveling suspicion aimed at all who seek to rise 
above the average. The honesty that often sounds so refreshing in conversation 
and political discourse can also bring to mind the many uses of tact. The 
"slower pace of life" is a wonderful idea until you need to get something done. 
</P>
<P>
"I must admit," Heaney said, "I wouldn't mind better service." 
</P>
<P>
Then, too, there is the question being asked by a lot of Australians 
themselves: How long can Australia keep out the rest of the world and its 
problems? The welfare state under Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke is showing 
signs of strain -- declining benefits and increased "privitization" of the 
public sector. Hawke's treasurer, Paul Keating, has warned that the trade 
deficit will turn the country into "a banana republic" unless its citizens can 
compete more vigorously in the world marketplace. In a reflection of what has 
happened in the United States, the cost of living is shooting up, driving 
housing prices in Sydney out of reach of the younger middle class for the first 
time since World War II. Vandalism, however modest compared with the mean 
streets of Los Angeles, is on the rise. Pollution has turned up on some of 
Sydney's beaches. And the non-discriminatory immigration policy has brought in 
substantial numbers of Asians in recent years, reawakening racist fears. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the Californians who have gone to Australia and stayed can be expected 
to accentuate the positive. For one reason or another, they're still there. 
They have found something in themselves or in the country that they didn't have 
before, something more important than bad service. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Woolley, the publisher, sat with a cup of tea one afternoon at her office 
near the University of Sydney and reflected on her decision 19 years ago to 
head west to make a new start. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my life has been better here," she said. "I remember when I went back 
for the first time after about three years, and all my friends in Hollywood 
were still waiting by the phone, waiting for something to happen. It made me 
see the difference, and the difference is that I looked beyond America." 
</P>
<P>
She said she realizes that after all these years she has undergone a 
fundamental change. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when I'd say, 'That's not the way we'd do it in America.' Now 
I go to America and think, 'That's not the way we'd do it in Australia.' "

<P>
LOUIS Friedman, one-time rocket scientist and now, as head of the 
Pasadena-based Planetary Society, one of the nation's most vocal cheerleaders 
for planetary exploration, had waited a long time for this moment and wanted to 
savor it in solitude. Launches always made him nervous, but this one, on a 
morning last April, was special. If it worked, it would mark the end of more 
than a decade of waiting for the United States to return to planetary 
exploration. If it didn't, it would be just another on a list of 
disappointments NASA has handed to Friedman in the past 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
He moved a few feet from his friends among the crowd of spectators at Cape 
Canaveral and positioned himself in clear view of the launch pad. Then he 
stared into the distance at the space shuttle Atlantis, which was scheduled 
momentarily to take the spacecraft Magellan into Earth orbit and then send it 
on its way to Venus. 
</P>
<P>
As a 31-year-old engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1972, Friedman's 
first supervisory job was study leader and program manager for the then-unnamed 
Magellan project. Had anyone told him then that he would be a grandfather by 
the time Magellan flew, he wouldn't have believed them. But since the 
mid-1970s, he had gradually become disillusioned with the false starts and 
delays in the American space program. 
</P>
<P>
This day, he had flown from California to Florida to watch the launch and take 
part in a panel discussion, a sort of celebration of America's return to space 
exploration. Standing alone at the edge of the crowd as the countdown entered 
its last minute, he half expected another delay. An optimist about most things, 
he had never had much faith in the wisdom of using the space shuttle instead of 
conventional rockets to launch spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
At T-minus 30 seconds, the countdown stopped. A malfunction had been detected; 
the shuttle engines shut down. Friedman was disappointed, and he couldn't help 
but immediately see the irony. 
</P>
<P>
"When that thing didn't go, and I was looking out from the causeway, I could 
also see a Titan (rocket) the Air Force was getting ready for another launch," 
he recalls a few weeks later. "Boy, did I wish we were using that." 
</P>
<P>
A week later, the shuttle carrying Magellan successfully took off. By then, 
Friedman was back in his office watching the event on television with his staff 
at the Planetary Society. He is enough of a space groupie, he says, to enjoy 
any successful launch -- even one that comes years late. 
</P>
<P>
IN THE PLANETARY SOCIETY'S 16-room headquarters, in a turn-of-the-century 
Greene and Greene mansion, Louis Friedman has the smallest office. ("Size is 
not power," he says.) He sits at an old oak desk above which hangs a 
needlepoint of Saturn stitched by his mother. When he's not on the phone, he's 
likely to be bounding downstairs to consult with his secretaries or Tim Lynch, 
the society's director of programs and development. He jogs each morning to 
work off the calories of an occasional beer, but seeing him scurry around, one 
wonders if the jogging isn't overkill. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly a decade, Friedman has spent most of his waking hours as the pivotal 
man in an exercise in mass salesmanship: finding ways to persuade Americans -- 
the public, politicians, bureaucrats and space scientists -- to rally behind 
planetary exploration as they did in the 1960s, after the Soviets launched 
Sputnik. In the past 25 years, he has evolved from space engineer to salesman 
of dreams in an era of diminished dreaming. "What I want to do," Friedman says, 
"is make space exploration happen." 
</P>
<P>
Under Friedman's direction, the Planetary Society is to planetary exploration 
what Common Cause is to political campaigning or the Sierra Club is to 
conservation. But in addition to calling for a general reform of the nation's 
space program, it has channeled most of its energies into promoting a single 
great notion: that of a joint U.S.-Soviet manned mission to Mars. The group's 
leaders believe that the Mars mission -- with its underpinnings of global peace 
through technology -- is the only aspiration grand enough to drum up the public 
interest needed to fuel real-life star trekking. And, Friedman hopes, that 
grass-roots enthusiasm will eventually bubble up to influence the Washington 
policy-makers and budget writers who can put the civil space program back on 
its old, optimistic track. 
</P>
<P>
As executive director, Friedman is administrator, policy-maker, publicist and 
even carnival barker, trying to lure passers-by inside the tent to see the 
exotica -- in this case, the planets in Earth's solar system. Despite his 
background as a card-carrying scientist, this may be the job he was born to do. 
"I live, breathe and eat Mars," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Early one morning, he is in Lynch's office discussing the logistics of 
scheduling Carl Sagan to testify before the House of Representatives on the 
NASA budget. Moments later, he is in his own office meeting with Angela Brown, 
a former Planetary Society staffer turned consultant, reviewing details for a 
society-sponsored festival to coincide with Voyager II's encounter with Neptune 
in August. By way of JPL, Voyager's live images of Neptune will be transmitted 
to the festival. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman squeezes his eyes shut to contain his enthusiasm when Brown tells him 
a national auto maker is interested in sending Neptune images from the JPL feed 
to all its dealerships through its internal cable system. "Oh, I would love a 
downlink (in the dealerships)," he groans. "Anything we can do to get this 
stuff into peoples' hands across America." 
</P>
<P>
Later still, he returns calls from the Washington Post and an aerospace trade 
magazine. One reporter wants a quick response from Friedman about news that the 
Soviets have activated a camera on a spacecraft sent to the Martian moon 
Phobos. Friedman raves over this development; the next day, he is the only 
American quoted in the story. 
</P>
<P>
His workday often starts early, with phone calls from home to the East Coast or 
the Soviet Union, and doesn't end until evening. One night, Friedman, red-eyed 
and weary, is the host at a Planetary Society reception. He has just heard a 
colleague in the society suggest to a visitor that America's next space goal 
should be to send more astronauts to the moon to set up a base. To Friedman, 
the suggestion is close to heresy. It makes no sense to send more humans to the 
moon because the whole idea bores the public, Friedman says, his voice rising. 
Manned lunar missions would only drain America's civil-space budget away from a 
more important, profound, exciting goal -- namely, Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman is forceful but good-humored as he argues. He is slightly rumpled, and 
his mop of graying black hair hints of Harpo Marx. If he was selling something 
simpler, like the women's hats his father once helped produce in New York, his 
charm and persistence would probably have made Friedman a rich man. This 
evening, though, his colleague can't be swayed. Friedman, undeterred and 
indefatigable, wanders over to another knot of guests, prepared to make his 
argument for a mission to Mars all over again. 
</P>
<P>
WHO WOULD HAVE predicted in the 1960s that a role like Friedman's would exist, 
much less be considered by so many to be necessary? Then, the promotion of 
planetary exploration, fueled by Soviet space advances and Cold War 
competitiveness, was led by an American President. John F. Kennedy talked about 
the dreams and set the goals, rallying Americans to create grand technologies, 
explore the universe, land on the moon -- and do it all before the Soviets 
could. It was called the Space Race, with all the urgency that implies. 
</P>
<P>
Through the 1970s, NASA launched 69 manned and unmanned missions. It was during 
those boom times, in 1970, that Friedman joined JPL, after working on the 
technical staff of a Massachusetts aerospace firm and then earning a doctorate 
in astronautics and aeronautics at MIT. He immediately went to work on Mariner 
10, which was launched just three years later and eventually flew by Venus and 
Mercury, taking pictures that gave the earthbound the first detailed knowledge 
of the innermost planets. When Friedman recalls the end of those heady days, he 
sounds almost wistful. "Then the shuttle came, and it just ruined everything." 
</P>
<P>
After Kennedy's death, White House-level passion for planetary exploration -- 
the key to funding -- began to dry up. Interest declined with each new 
President and each new escalation of the dollar-draining Vietnam War. Then, in 
1972, shortly after the last Apollo spacecraft landed a man on the moon, 
President Nixon unveiled a plan to build a space shuttle, promoted as a 
quicker, cheaper way to fly in space. ("You don't go to space to be cheap," 
Friedman grouses today. "You stay home to be cheap.") Nixon rejected another of 
the space program options recommended by a presidential commission -- sending 
humans to Mars, an expensive project that would be completed many years after 
his White House tenure. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman considers Nixon's shuttle decision a turning point. NASA budgets began 
to drop and planetary exploration, which a generation had come to believe would 
be a continuing part of American achievement, suffered. In the mid-'60s, NASA's 
annual budget climbed to $26 billion (in 1988 dollars). From 1972 through last 
year, the agency's total budget averaged less than a third of that, about $8 
billion a year (in 1988 dollars). Within that budget, planetary exploration 
changed from favorite child to sad stepsister of the space shuttle. According 
to one study of NASA budgets, when measured in dollars adjusted for inflation, 
planetary funding dropped 75% between 1974 and 1978. The 1989 budget for 
planetary exploration (about $417 million) remains lower than it was 15 years 
ago, when the figures are adjusted for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
After Pioneer Venus 10 blasted off toward Venus in 1978, exploration launches 
stopped. Several unmanned planetary missions in development were relegated to 
the back burner, including Magellan, the probe of Jupiter known as Galileo and 
a joint European-U.S. mission to study the sun. Out of frustration, Friedman 
applied for and won a yearlong fellowship to work on the staff of the Senate 
committee that addresses space program goals and funding. It gave him a chance 
to reassess his career while allowing him a bird's eye view of space 
policy-making in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back at JPL, two prominent space scientists also were alarmed at the 
stagnation of NASA's planetary program. One was Bruce Murray, then director of 
JPL; the other was star-astronomer Carl Sagan, a frequent visitor to the lab. 
Both had been gratified to see public interest build as the two Voyager 
spacecraft, launched in 1977, approached Jupiter. But they were distressed that 
this public interest did not translate into money from Washington. President 
Carter told Sagan as much at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
Murray and Sagan, so accustomed to looking beyond the stars, readjusted their 
gazes earthward. An organization to rally around planetary exploration would 
have to start at the grass roots, they believed. But neither had the time to 
start or run such a group. In spring, 1979, when Friedman visited JPL in 
anticipation of returning in the fall, Murray asked him to direct the new 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1979, from his dining room table, Friedman launched the Planetary 
Society. It had little money, three members and a vague idea about how to 
attract more. The three co-founders had only their goals: to educate, to 
influence space policy and, perhaps, to provide funding for planetary research. 
And they decided they could do it all 3,000 miles from the hub of space 
policy-making, in Pasadena, the home not only of JPL but of Friedman and 
Murray, too. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of its first year, the society had established the roots of a 
sophisticated direct-mail operation and signed up more than 20,000 members. 
Today, it has about 125,000 members in 104 countries and 26 part-time and 
full-time employees. It is the largest (by about five times) and best-known 
space-interest group in the world, and its annual budget exceeds $3.5 million, 
supported mostly by membership fees of $20 to $30 and donations. 
</P>
<P>
During its first years, the Planetary Society leaders hewed to a fairly 
conservative line, advocating unmanned missions, testifying before committees 
and spearheading studies to salvage planetary programs threatened by NASA 
budget cuts. In 1981, Friedman organized society members in a letter-writing 
campaign entreating NASA to reverse its decision to stay earthbound in 1986 
while Halley's comet made one of its rare appearances. The campaign generated 
10,000 letters but failed to get the government to plan a Halley's flyby. 
</P>
<P>
Chastened by this defeat, the society took more aggressive action a year later 
when the Senate refused to fund a NASA project that would have listened for 
signs of intelligent life in outer space. The Planetary Society began financing 
a similar project of its own. Film maker Steven Spielberg contributed $100,000 
to help a Harvard scientist build and monitor a sophisticated radio system that 
still operates today, waiting for a signal that earthlings are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
But the society's leaders had not yet fixed upon the one grand goal that they 
believed would get planetary research back on track. Inspiration arrived when, 
in January, 1985, the society co-sponsored a symposium in Washington on the 
effects of space weapons on civilian use of space. 
</P>
<P>
The Reagan White House was gearing up its Star Wars program. Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev had not yet come into power in the Soviet Union. Relations between 
the two countries were tense. One afternoon, 600 people crowded into a room to 
hear a panel that included Murray, Sagan and Roald Z. Sagdeev, then the leader 
of the Soviet space program. In the course of the discussion, Sagdeev suggested 
that the United States and the Soviet Union follow up on the cooperation 
displayed in the docking of the Soyuz and Apollo spacecraft 10 years earlier. 
What Sagan was to say next, Friedman recalls, sent a current of "electricity" 
through the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are interested in pumping the economy," Sagan told the audience, "there 
are far better ways to do it (than the Strategic Defense Initiative). Think of 
the major cooperative programs which are fully within our technological 
capability and which could be done at a tiny fraction of the cost of Star Wars 
technology. Think about a joint U.S.-Soviet-manned, and womanned, mission to 
Mars." 
</P>
<P>
Sagan's words so ignited the Planetary Society board members that they later 
adjourned with Sagdeev to a private room to discuss the idea. The Soviet 
scientist talked excitedly about a split-mission idea, with each country 
performing independent tasks that would add up to a complete manned mission to 
Mars. Sagdeev's enthusiasm seemed to open new worlds of possibility. The 
Planetary Society had found its goal. 
</P>
<P>
IN 1985, AS THE Planetary Society was becoming euphoric about Mars, NASA was 
entering one of its most depressing periods. The agency had spent an 
ever-expanding amount of time and money developing a space shuttle that, 13 
years after conception, seemed far from keeping its promise to boost space 
commercialization by providing an oft-scheduled, reusable craft for launching 
satellites and spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
Its proponents, led by now-retired NASA Administrator James Fletcher, had 
promised that the shuttle could be built for billions of dollars less than its 
critics claimed. By the mid-'80s, the critics were beginning to look right. The 
shuttle was plagued by engineering problems, including faulty tiles and engine 
failures, and was still unable to meet its flight schedule. So unreliable was 
it that the Air Force and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
made plans to launch their satellites from conventional rockets. 
</P>
<P>
To NASA, the Planetary Society was a sometimes useful civilian adjunct, an 
effective promoter of planetary science, but little more. The society's dreams 
of a return to the glory days of space exploration were just that to the agency 
-- dreams easily dismissed, economically unrealistic, not on the agenda. Some 
of the society's goals were shared by NASA, says NASA spokesman Charles 
Redmond, but the two organizations disagreed on "the timing of goals and 
funding." Friedman and the Planetary Society acknowledge that their efforts in 
the mid-'80s had little policy effect on NASA. Relations between Fletcher and 
the society were tense at best. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the Challenger shuttle disaster of January, 1986, and massive 
soul-searching at NASA. In 1987, as the agency looked for redirection, Fletcher 
commissioned former astronaut Sally K. Ride to recommend how the agency could 
regain its leadership in space. Ride sounded some of the Planetary Society's 
goals when she called for NASA to expand exploration by returning to the moon 
with one eventual mission of landing humans on Mars. She advised moving slowly: 
"America should not rush headlong toward Mars; we should adopt a strategy to 
continue an orderly expansion outward from Earth." 
</P>
<P>
Ride's report, coupled with growing publicity for the Mars initiative, moved 
Mars from the back burner to the national agenda. Friedman points out that 
these days, when NASA talks about going to the moon, the goal is framed as a 
precursor to an eventual Mars trip. He believes this would not have happened 
without the constant prodding of the Planetary Society. 
</P>
<P>
Any space project comes about as a budgetary interaction between NASA and 
Congress, and on Capitol Hill, the society has had more success. For instance, 
it claims some credit for blocking the Reagan Administration's plans to abandon 
planetary exploration in 1981. It is generally credited with pushing through 
legislation assuring that a conventional rocket will launch the Mars Observer, 
an unmanned spacecraft designed to orbit and photograph the planet, when it 
goes up in 1992. And now, occasionally, a resolution to support a joint 
U.S.-Soviet Mars venture will be introduced and voted on -- so far to defeat -- 
in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
For Friedman, small victories aren't enough. If all goes according to plan, the 
Planetary Society will get to Mars before NASA does. In mid-February, the 
society took its boldest step so far to stimulate public interest in the Mars 
goal. It signed an agreement that, Friedman says, will make it the first 
private group to participate with the Soviet Union in a space experiment. 
</P>
<P>
That is why, on a recent afternoon, eight space engineers are seated around two 
tables pushed together in the main room of the Pasadena headquarters. They make 
up the team brought together by the society to develop one part of an 
experimental balloon that is to be built by France's space agency. The balloon, 
which will float just above the surface of Mars, will be released from an 
unmanned Soviet spacecraft expected to be launched in 1994. For the Planetary 
Society, this project is more than a simple engineering challenge. It is a 
chance to prove that space cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United 
States is possible. It is a symbolic way to move ahead with the Mars goal 
without waiting for NASA and the White House to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
The engineers at the table have volunteered or been hired by the society to 
design a prototype of what is officially named the Surface Navigation Kontact 
Experiment. The SNAKE, as it has been dubbed, will be a 30-foot-long titanium 
guide rope that will dangle 100 feet from the balloon as it skims the surface 
of Mars. The SNAKE will gather dirt and pebbles from the red planet for 
analysis by the small instruments it will carry, which will also study the 
balloon's speed and the Martian atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The society has agreed to finance production of the SNAKE through its first 
prototype; Friedman figures that the first two years of development will cost 
$450,000, one-third to one-fifth of what it would cost if a government agency 
was conducting the project. The society has already garnered $75,000 in 
donations from one mailing to its members. A private foundation has donated 
$30,000. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting goes slowly. By the time it ends, after 8 p.m., the youngest 
engineer, Jim Cantrell, a graduate student at Utah State University, has 
volunteered to make the first prototype in his garage. He builds race cars on 
weekends, he says, so he has the necessary tools. They agree to meet in August 
in the Mojave Desert to test Cantrell's creation before they deliver it to 
France in September. 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 TIME MAGAZINE poll reported that 72% of Americans believe that a joint 
U.S.-Soviet Mars mission is a good idea; newspapers editorialize in support of 
it; the Planetary Society even got 250 celebrities, from former U.N. Ambassador 
Jeane J. Kirkpatrick to Nobel laureate Linus Pauling, to sign its "Mars 
Declaration," an 800-word statement published last year calling for human 
exploration of Mars. Even Redmond, at NASA, admits its appeal: Everyone at the 
space agency, he says, thinks it would "be a great thing to do." Then come the 
caveats. Is basing a mission on cooperation between the United States and the 
Soviet Union ridiculously optimistic? "Making Mars (exploration) dependent on 
peace on earth undermines the chance of going to Mars," says John Logsdon, a 
Planetary Society advisory board member who directs the Space Policy Institute 
at George Washington University. And Redmond says that NASA is concerned that 
it does not have the technological know-how to send people to Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Most naysayers, though, talk money. By Friedman's estimate, the joint mission 
would cost $60 billion. Redmond says $100 billion is a conservative estimate. 
To get to Mars, he says, and complete other existing projects, NASA would have 
to squeeze at least $20 billion a year from Congress over 10 years. Today, the 
agency is barely able to get $12 billion annually. Considering competing budget 
demands and the U.S. deficit, he says, the needed level of funding is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have another question about the economics. "There's sort of a 
knee-jerk enthusiasm for a grand mission, and I join in that to some degree," 
says physicist James Van Allen, a member of the Planetary Society's advisory 
board and discoverer of the Van Allen radiation belt that surrounds Earth. 
However, he sees the Mars mission as a "vastly expensive undertaking" that 
would "seriously handicap" valuable unmanned projects. 
</P>
<P>
The criticisms cause Friedman to launch into his best salesman persona, 
slightly irritated because the naysayers just don't understand. It's a 
chicken-and-egg proposition, he says. Just as the moon goal of the 1960s helped 
generate financing for other planetary projects, he says, so, too, would the 
Mars goal enhance all planetary exploration. We set the moon as a goal, he 
argues, before the technology existed to take men there. As for the wisdom of 
linking an exploration goal to unstable earthly relations, Friedman is 
pragmatic and optimistic there, too. A human mission to Mars, with its huge 
price tag and risks, can only be justified if it serves a strong national 
purpose, he says. 
</P>
<P>
And when it comes to the price, the society has a strategy that actually 
matches NASA's. Redmond says that the only way to obtain the funding is with 
presidential backing. Friedman is asking that all 130,000 signers of the Mars 
Declaration write to President Bush before July 20, the 20th anniversary of the 
first moon landing, urging him to support the Mars goal. However, Friedman 
concedes that if even this anniversary cannot inspire Bush to acknowledge the 
Mars initiative, "the whole momentum will be lost" for at least the next four 
years. But patience and persistence are part of Friedman's strategy, too. The 
challenge for the Planetary Society in a changing world is to keep the verve in 
the Mars initiative. And if Friedman fails? What if, in the end, he cannot sell 
the Mars vision to the White House or Congress or NASA? Will it all have been a 
waste? 
</P>
<P>
Friedman is sitting over a lunch of beer and bratwurst at a Pasadena restaurant 
as he considers this. He pauses for a moment and then begins talking about John 
Gardner, the founder of Common Cause who, early on, provided Friedman with key 
advice on how to set up a public-interest group. "Reform is never completed. 
You never succeed," Friedman says, paraphrasing Gardner. "It's a process. It 
goes on and on and on and on. We always look at our goal as long range. We 
always keep hope alive."

A SHOW OF HANDS;

<P>
PHOTOS THAT PAY TRIBUTE TO ARTISTS AND THEIR TOOLS

VENICE ARTIST RENA SMALL began photographing the hands of artists in 1984, and 
now she regards the process as something of a ritual. First, she isolates the 
hands with a black drape that makes them look as if they are emerging from a 
monk's robe. As she shoots, her subjects become more conscious of their hands, 
often assuming a prayerful pose. But Small is the one doing the worshiping: She 
is an unabashed romantic about the life of the artist, and she sees the artists 
she has chosen to photograph as mentors, if not quite saints. Her series of 60 
black-and-white photographs will be exhibited at Art Center College of Design's 
downtown Pasadena gallery this weekend through July 5. 
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old photographer, painter and performance artist says the project 
was inspired in part by a wish to pay tribute to the artists she reveres. At 
the same time, she says, it is "a way of shaking hands with the audience," 
selling the romance of the artist to a public that sometimes perceives artists 
as unsympathetic creatures who force incomprehensible or offensive works on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Small started the project while living in New York and expects to continue her 
study of two of all artists' most basic tools throughout her life because it 
allows her to collaborate with contemporary art's luminaries. Half a dozen, 
among them Julian Schnabel and Robert Graham, refused her invitation to sit. It 
took three months to set up her 1985 shoot with Andy Warhol; now she's on the 
trail of David Hockney. In general, though, most have been cooperative. Christo 
became not a draper but a drapee; Richard Diebenkorn was happy to take part as 
long as his face wasn't photographed; Charles Arnoldi showed up with 
ink-stained hands from a print run. "He liked that," Small says, "because it 
was about being an artist and having your hands dirtied." 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, Small unwittingly became involved in the tragedy of an artist 
she had meant to celebrate. She captured New York sculptor Carl Andre's hands 
making what could be interpreted as a pushing motion. The photo took on bizarre 
significance when, in 1985, Andre was accused of murdering his wife by pushing 
her out a 34th-floor window. He was acquitted last year. 
</P>
<P>
The Art Center gallery, at 54 W. Colorado Blvd., is open 12:30 to 6 p.m. 
Tuesday through Thursday and 12:30 to 9 p.m. Friday and Saturday. Joyce Miller

FASHION: A MODERN OBJECT LESSON; 
</P>
<P>
HOW MARIO TAMAYO AND JEF HUEREQUE BROUGHT HIGH STYLE TO THE LOWER REACHES OF 
MELROSE AVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA FOLEY, Barbara Foley, former West Coast fashion editor of Women's 
Wear Daily and W, is a free-lance fashion writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MODERN Objects was a small, 2-year-old art gallery on the unhip eastern stretch 
of Melrose Avenue when entrepreneur Mario Tamayo decided last October to team 
up with men's fashion designer Jef Huereque and transform the gallery into a 
clothing store. They both wanted an unpredictable, hip but homey kind of place. 
</P>
<P>
"We love color, we love all kinds of people and elements working together, and 
we love humor," begins Tamayo, 31, who also owns Cha Cha Cha and Cafe Mambo, a 
couple of high-energy Caribbean restaurants in the same East Hollywood 
neighborhood as Modern Objects. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in classic, comfortable shapes: easy shirts, pleated pants, sort of 
traditional suits," adds Huereque, 36, who does the designing while Tamayo runs 
the business. Huereque's retail experience comes from having worked at two 
other highly influential and successful Melrose Avenue shops, Maxfield and 
Roppongi. He honed his craft while doing custom designs for clients such as 
rocker Charlie Sexton, magician David Copperfield, former Fleetwood Mac member 
Lindsey Buckingham and the rock band Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
At Modern Objects, Huereque says, "we go wild with the fabrics, colors and 
patterns. This is meant to be a store for men who know what they want but can't 
always find it and who aren't afraid to stand out." 
</P>
<P>
Roomy shirts, which retail from $75 to $200, are made in ultra-bright shades of 
pleated voile, chiffon or Jacquard-pattern silk. Turquoise, yellow, fuchsia, 
red and royal blue are a few of the hues; polka dots, exotic florals and 
black-and-white Dalmatian spots are some of the prints. There are pleated 
gabardine trousers in baggy '40s proportions to match the oversize shirts and a 
more subdued selection of trouser shapes and fabrics in linen, priced from $125 
to $145. Boxer shorts, starting at $25, in printed rayon or silk Jacquard, are 
big sellers. A custom suit can cost $600 or more. All of the clothes are tucked 
into grand French furniture. 
</P>
<P>
The ambience, as one might suspect, is founded on traditionalism -- with more 
than a touch of rule-breaking spirit. 
</P>
<P>
"Being here is like going through a friend's closet and discovering things that 
you have to ask about," Huereque says. "We want interaction with our 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
Although the clothes are sold mostly to men -- such as rock star Adam Ant, 
photo stylist Raymond Lee and Chicago band member Robert Lamm -- Tamayo and 
Huereque say that women, including Beverly Hills cosmetics maven Gale Hayman 
and actresses Talisa Soto, Denise Crosby, Winona Ryder and Donna Dixon, also 
wear Modern Objects menswear. 
</P>
<P>
As colorful and nonconformist as the clothes, the store is a monument to 
contemporary artists. The exterior features a brilliant violet-and-marigold 
chevron mosaic by David Carver. The floors are painted turquoise; the walls are 
bright gold. Chinese-motif wallpaper covers screens that conceal the window 
displays, balancing the decor's bold color, delicate turn-of-the-century French 
furniture and a gun-metal gray, rococo-style chandelier. The ceiling is a 
heavenly sky painted by Teddy Sandoval. 
</P>
<P>
Local artist Annie Kelly painted a vivid mural showing elements of an atelier 
-- scissors, fabrics -- on the jewelry case, which houses the works of 
designers such as Hilary Beane, Robert La Haye and Michael Bayes. A Phil Garner 
lamp, perched rakishly atop a stiffly coiled electrical wire, throws light on a 
red cowhide chair by Larry Totah. Paintings by other local artists, including 
Robert Gil de Montes, Jim Klein and Mundo Meza, adorn the walls. 
</P>
<P>
Blue velvet drapes cover the entry to the dressing room, which has been 
silver-leafed by Rick Gildart and furnished with a Neptune-mosaic tile bench by 
Merle Fishman. A cross made of bottle caps by Jon Bok hangs on the wall across 
from a full-length, baroque-framed mirror. 
</P>
<P>
Presiding over it all is an enormous, gold Romanesque head, garnered from a 
movie studio and crowned in twinkling lights. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the store to be stimulating and zap people with energy," says 
Huereque, who created the store's look with Tamayo. "It's unique, colorful, 
personal, and the work of local artists is very important to the feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Many credit Tamayo with having ignited a burst of energy on Melrose near 
Vermont when he opened his first restaurant, Cha Cha Cha, three years ago. 
Other small businesses followed, and now the neighborhood is peppered with 
artistic commerce: Livestock, Judy Cameon's jewelry and clothing boutique; 
Jocelyn Winship's design studio; the God Help Us thrift store; a Mexican 
curiosity shop called Y-Que; Romp, a vintage-clothes store; Goodman &amp; 
Charlton, an interior design studio, and many artists' lofts. 
</P>
<P>
"Our success lies with our accessibility," Tamayo says. "We go everywhere, try 
to see everything and really believe in supporting our friends, so our friends 
support us. If you stop letting all kinds of different influences in, you kill 
the magic." 
</P>

We should have a national debate on the pros and cons of legalizing drugs. If, 
after reviewing the choices, the people begin to react favorably to 
legalization, the politicians will be able to respond. 
</P>
<P>
Decriminalization does not condone drug use but, instead, recognizes the great 
peril that drugs are to all of society, especially to the youth of this nation. 
It will eliminate profit and reduce drug demand by providing money for 
prevention and treatment.

I wonder why our government doesn't force Colombia to get in the fight against 
drugs. Why not start with a boycott of Colombian coffee, probably their second 
most important and profitable export, other than cocaine? You can't kill an 
octopus by cutting off its tentacles -- you've got to go to its heart.

THE COCAINE WAR

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We propose an effective and efficient tack that would eradicate the market for 
drugs. We suggest a systematic engendering and enhancement of individual 
self-esteem and responsibility among our youth. Ideally, this would be done at 
home, from the crib. Realistically, it's not, so the schools must incorporate 
self-esteem and personal responsibility skills, starting in kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
It is an irrefutable fact that individuals with a strong, positive sense of 
self aren't as likely to succumb to pushers' tactics. Conversely, those who use 
the wares of pushers fall prey largely because they have low self-esteem and a 
lack of coping skills -- and therefore no pride, no self-determination, no 
personal responsibility -- to counterbalance the smooth sales job, the peer 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine the results if the money and manpower spent on fighting the cocaine war 
on the enemy's terms were instead expended on well-proven programs that create 
and nurture strong self-esteem and personal responsibility, beginning with the 
upcoming generation of would-be drug-lord targets.

ILANA GOOR FURNITURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LASKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISRAELI-BORN ILANA GOOR began sculpting during the '60s, while a resident in 
Los Angeles. After a one-woman show in Los Angeles, her work found its way into 
the office of finance minister and deputy prime minister Shimon Peres and the 
War Memorial Yad le-Banim, Raanana, Israel (among the tallest sculptures in 
Israel). Yet, Goor admits: "My serious stuff was very difficult to sell. Only 
collectors bought it." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, popular success has come through the sculptural metal furniture 
collection she began creating five years ago. Its rugged, archeological 
surfaces are the right look at the right time (coffee tables with modernist 
polished chrome bases are out of style and "natural" finishes such as 
verdigris, rusty iron and bronze are in). Goor's popularity also coincides with 
a revived interest in art nouveau; the vinelike spirals embellishing her pieces 
evoke the lush tangle of tendrils typifying the work of Tiffany or Hector 
Guimard (who did the beloved entrances to the Paris Metro). Says Goor: "My 
pieces look organic, as if they're growing. Everything is a little 
asymmetrical." 
</P>
<P>
Far from scheming to cash in on current trends, however, Goor came by her look 
naturally. In need of furnishings for her 400-year-old house in Jaffa, Israel, 
Goor took inspiration from the in-progress renovation. She fashioned the frame 
for a glass-topped porch table, for instance, from pieces of concrete 
reinforcing bars. To exploit her house's dramatic view overlooking the 
Mediterranean, she created a lounge chair that evokes the characteristics of a 
rickety old deck chair at a seaside resort. "Friends would see the pieces and 
ask for one for their own house. Then came requests for lamps, tea carts and 
beds," she recalls. Goor embellishes her pieces with spookily realistic bronze 
birds, frogs, snails, turtles, rabbits, pigeons, eagles, cats and dogs. They 
mimic the creatures who would congregate on her terrace in the morning. As the 
sun rose in the sky and the day grew hotter, the animals would leave to seek 
shade. Missing them, she sculpted substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
Free of the Holocaust-laden Angst pervading her "serious" sculpture, Goor's 
furniture finds the artist rolling up her sleeves and having fun. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ilana Goor's furniture is available through designers at Kneedler-Fauchere at 
the Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles; telephone (213) 855-1313. List prices 
range from $200 for a bronze bird to $2,600 for a side table to $21,000 for the 
deck chair.

INTELLECTUALS: MUTE VOICE OF AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Douglas Davis, Douglas Davis, artist and critic, is a visiting professor 
this summer at the Art Center College of Design, Pasadena. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a secret speech to his generals last week, leaked by sources in Hong Kong, 
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping reportedly blamed the recent revolution on a 
handful of scholars, scientists, students and poets -- most of all on Fang 
Lizhi, the lonely astrophysicist now taking asylum at the U.S. Embassy in 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Deng's claim, however exaggerated, underlines the active presence of 
intellectuals in pro-democracy movements throughout the communist world. This 
is a fact largely ignored in the United States, where uprisings are normally 
explained on the ground of economics or power politics, not ideas. In the 
Soviet Union, physicists like Andrei D. Sakharov, historians like Roy Medvedev, 
poets like Andrei Voznesensky, editors like Vitaly Korotich, playwrights like 
Mikhail Shatrov and actors like Mikhail Ulyanov have all consistently spoken 
out for reform and an end to official censorship. 
</P>
<P>
Some have campaigned -- often successfully -- for office. In Moldavia, six 
members from the writer's union won all the seats allotted in the Chamber of 
Deputies to this region. In each of the three Baltic republics -- Estonia, 
Latvia, Lithuania -- artists, architects and writers were among the leaders and 
creators of the "popular front" parties. 
</P>
<P>
Darting back and forth between raging overseas debates and deadly calm in the 
United States is to witness an extraordinary contradiction. While egalitarian 
idealism flares abroad, the intellectual and artistic community in the citadel 
of democracy languishes, mute and supine. Few major American artists or writers 
have roused themselves to impassioned support for colleagues in China or the 
Soviet Union. It took almost one week for Norman Mailer and Susan Sontag to 
organize a protest -- in the name of an indifferent American literati -- death 
threats directed at novelist Salman Rushdie by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
To this point not a single American equivalent of Voznesensky has spoken out 
against the recent rise of censorship pressure here. It includes the 
fundamentalist letter-writing campaigns aimed at sponsors who support 
"licentious" television programs like "Three's Company," plus a handful of 
attacks launched from the floor of the Senate on allegedly "anti-Christian" 
works of visual art partly funded by public money through the National 
Endowment for the Arts. Bereft of eloquent defenders, the irresolute sponsors 
and the equally irresolute endowment are begging the pardon of their attackers, 
led by Sen. Jesse A. Helms (R-N.C.). This month, the august Corcoran Gallery of 
Art in Washington canceled an exhibition of provocative, partly nude 
photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe, on the debatable ground that the 
"political occasion . . . the present discussion" demands it. 
</P>
<P>
In one sense, there is nothing new about these incidents. From the birth of our 
anti-aristocratic democracy, anti-intellectual rhetoric has flourished. 
American intellectuals have traditionally run for cover, handing over the 
conduct of political affairs primarily to lawyers and businessmen. Thomas 
Jefferson was ridiculed in early campaigns for being a "philosopher." John 
Quincy Adams was derided by the fans of Andrew Jackson -- "John Quincy Adams 
who can write and Andrew Jackson who can fight" -- presaging similar attacks on 
Adlai E. Stevenson one century later when a candidate who spoke in compound 
sentences dared run against Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly there is no tradition of poets, professors and painters running for 
President, serving in legislatures or speaking out on high matters of public 
policy, as they regularly do in most of Europe and Latin America (French 
President Francois Mitterand is both poet and historian; Giovanni Spadolini, 
president of the Italian Senate, is a distinguished professor of history; Alan 
Garcia, president of Peru, is a poet, while Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas 
Llosa has been a major opponent of the Garcia government). 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. torpor becomes objectionable because such great issues are at stake. 
American intellectuals are hardly threatened by ugly reprisals currently 
applied in China, recently in the Soviet Union and at least threatened here in 
the 1950s when the late Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy. equated dissent with treason. 
</P>
<P>
There has been a steady anti-intellectual drum beat on the right since the late 
1970s. Neo-conservatives such as Harvard sociologist Daniel Bell, author 
William F. Buckley Jr. and political scientist Jeane J. Kirkpatrick have been 
blaming the ills of the post-industrial West on the Marxism they see lurking in 
contemporary culture. Aided by the media, they have also been proclaiming the 
ascendancy of old-time religion and groundhog capitalism, supposedly 
exemplified by Ronald Reagan's landslide victories. 
</P>
<P>
But these arguments are easily refuted. The Bells, Buckleys and Kirkpatricks 
are themselves intellectuals, whose activism ought to encourage rather than 
silence those they mean to cow. The last Congress passed more "liberal" 
legislation than any Congress since 1948, including funding for the National 
Endowment for the Arts. The legislators were obviously buoyed by the support of 
voters who reelected these same congressmen in droves. Congressional protests 
against NEA radicalism have been fomented and led by a tiny right-wing 
minority. 
</P>
<P>
What, then, is the excuse for this unseemly silence among artists and 
intellectuals? 
</P>
<P>
One of the steady signals from what passes for the American left is the 
suffocating boredom of American politics, combined with torpor on campus among 
both students and faculty. Not long ago, the American left was complaining 
about George Bush's lack of eloquence compared with the bold rhetoric of 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
No more. America is mute and timid from the bottom to the top, not vice-versa. 
While the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Korea and China burn, inspired 
by the ideals we are supposed to exemplify, we freeze. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Camus once said he wrote about politics to elevate political discourse 
in France. If thoughtful Americans want Bush to rise to lyrical heights in 
behalf of free speech, glasnost or Fang Lizhi, then thoughtful Americans must 
demand it. 
</P>
<P>
Great times and great causes ought to provoke writers and artists -- and, 
through them, voters. In the mistaken notion that great art demands pure, 
secluded devotion, America's creative minority ignores such examples as 
Whitman, Hemingway, Picasso and Pushkin. Their work soared in public forms -- 
reportage, narrative poetry, murals -- in moments of crisis. This is such a 
moment, as Deng warned his generals. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to read all the time," Voznesenksy recently told an interviewer in 
Moscow. "Every night, on television, in the papers, there's something new." 
There is no boredom abroad in the world -- only here, in our best minds.

NO POLITICAL STORMS AHEAD FOR BUSH'S STILL POND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ronald Brownstein, Ronald Brownstein covers politics for the National 
Journal.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Look fast: George Bush is completing one of his periodic transformations from 
wimp to titan. After being canonized as a political Goliath for his 
come-from-behind thrashing of Michael S. Dukakis, Bush spent his electoral 
honeymoon on the couch, listening to the Washington Establishment condemn him 
for caution, indecisiveness and apparently terminal blandness. Now his notices 
are shifting again. Bush's proposal to cut troops in Europe received a 
thundering response abroad; his plan for controlling air pollution was warmly 
welcomed at home. Bush's job-approval and personal ratings have soared. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most important, Bush is confounding Democratic efforts to develop a 
line of attack against him. Though it remains early in the Administration, the 
Democrats' inability to draw a bead on Bush has implications for the 1990 
midterm elections and for the 1992 presidential race. It often seems that 
political campaigns pivot on a few weeks of misleading TV commercials and 
orchestrated sound bites, but the themes that dominate national elections 
usually simmer for years. Right now, for the Democrats, nothing is cooking. 
</P>
<P>
By this point in Jimmy Carter's presidency, the perception of the former 
Georgia governor as incompetent at home and overmatched abroad -- central 
pillars of the GOP case against him in 1980 -- was percolating through 
political circles. By this point in Ronald Reagan's first term, Democrats were 
blasting him for "unfairness" in his economic priorities, belligerence toward 
the Soviet Union and indifference toward the environment -- issues Walter F. 
Mondale tried against him in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast, the opposition brief against Bush hasn't taken form. If 
Reagan's first year was a war, Bush's is a snore. "Nobody is making a coherent 
case against George Bush right now," said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. 
</P>
<P>
That's not only because the Democrats have been too busy dressing their own 
wounded on Capitol Hill to take aim at the White House. Bush hasn't given the 
Democrats much to shoot at. He's pushed a centrist agenda that doesn't inspire 
outrage. At the same time, when pressed enough, he's capably rejoined charges 
that his agenda is too modest: After Democrats accused Bush of ignoring Soviet 
arms-reduction initiatives, he unveiled his surprisingly bold proposal for 
troop cuts in Europe -- and changed the issue's political dynamic overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has been much less prone than Reagan to box himself into constricting 
ideological corners. That flexibility has allowed him to commandeer a strong 
middle-ground position on several issues that help Democrats, particularly arms 
control and the environment. He cut his losses on aid to the Nicaraguan 
Contras. The congressional Democrats haven't been able to get far enough away 
from Bush to effectively fire on him; even in the continuing legislative fight 
over the minimum wage, the difference between the President and Congress is 
only 30 cents. Except for Bush's uncertain handling of the Alaskan oil spill 
and his opposition to abortion, liberal interest groups have had nothing to 
rally against. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush has not broken off big chunks of the population and declared them the 
enemy or allowed them to declare themselves the enemy," said one White House 
aide. "He is not going about this in a polarizing way. The reason the lines of 
attack aren't there isn't because of some neo-Teflon quality of Bush; it's that 
there is no ideological issues base from which to oppose him." 
</P>
<P>
As the new House leadership settles into place, the Democrats will do a better 
job of building that base. But the party faces a larger problem in drawing a 
line against Bush: catching the public's attention. Before the 1988 campaign, 
many Democratic strategists, and even some Republicans, predicted the nation 
was approaching a cyclical turning point -- when its focus would shift from 
private concerns that defined the 1980s to the public initiatives that animated 
the 1960s. But those hopes have been disappointed: Even in Washington, there's 
little sense now that government is the driving force in American life. Next to 
the tumultuous events shaking the communist world, Washington's paralyzing 
obsession with personality and peccadillo seems trivial -- a food fight on 
history's fringe. The public has recoiled accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
That disinterest subtly strengthens Bush, whose public agenda is far more 
limited than congressional Democrats'. Democrats continue to take heart from 
polls that show voters want to confront such social problems as drugs and 
homelessness. But those attitudes remain diffuse and not necessarily aimed at 
government action. After absorbing eight years of Reagan's homilies against big 
government, Americans don't expect much from Washington; in one recent survey 
only 25% of the voters said they expected any significant help. That atrophied 
view of government responsibility has lowered the standard Bush must meet. 
</P>
<P>
In all this, reality matters. Traditionally, Americans don't ask much of 
government as long as it seems to have big issues under control -- the economy, 
international relations. And at that tectonic level of politics, too, the 
underlying forces now look to be grinding in Bush's direction. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-eminent among these is Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's apparently 
boundless determination to reach accommodation with the West. Gorbachev's need 
to divert resources from military to domestic spending are driving him to reach 
agreements with the United States limiting both intercontinental nuclear 
weapons and conventional forces in Europe. As the Cold War fades, Bush's luster 
can only brighten. 
</P>
<P>
Economic forces also boost Bush. Because of demographic trends, the economy 
over the next decade will have to provide jobs for fewer new workers than 
during the 1970s and early 1980s. Without a major recession, unemployment -- 
now at a politically insignificant 5% -- will stay low. Inflation, the most 
immediate economic concern, remains an issue where Republicans have more 
credibility than Democrats; besides, few experts expect prices to heat up soon. 
</P>
<P>
The flip side of these positive trends, for the White House, is that they 
entrench the Democrats' congressional majority. Bush's consensus-building may 
make it difficult for Democrats to challenge him, but it frustrates Republicans 
trying to create the polarizing issues that could dislodge Democrats in 1990. 
Bush's low-key style may also prevent his putting down deep roots with the 
public that could anchor him if events turn sour. If he has any doubts, he 
could check this with Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing in politics remains constant. But no storms that could disturb this 
political equilibrium seem to be gathering on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans are trying to make congressional ethics a major issue for the 1990 
election, but there's little evidence that people are paying attention. Recent 
polls continue to show the dichotomy: No matter how much the people revile 
Congress as a whole, they consider their own representative a model of civic 
virtue. 
</P>
<P>
Now controlled by an activist conservative majority, the U.S. Supreme Court 
could send more ripples into Washington's still pond. The court's recent series 
of decisions limiting affirmative action could force Congress to revisit the 
issue -- unsettling Democrats, who are trying to regain the votes of 
middle-class whites generally hostile to such programs. But Republicans, trying 
to attract blacks without offending their white base, won't be much happier. 
Neither side is anxious for a sweeping court decision on abortion. A decision 
restricting or overturning the 1973 ruling to legalize abortion might make that 
emotional issue the dominant concern in 1990 gubernatorial and statehouse 
races, with unpredictable results. 
</P>
<P>
Still more important is the public's nagging long-term anxiety about America's 
faltering international economic competitiveness, symbolized by the persistent 
trade deficit. Polls continue to show that voters fear the nation is falling 
behind Japan and other foreign competitors and could face an eroding standard 
of living over the next generation. 
</P>
<P>
These doubts remain a potentially powerful political force. But they were 
present during the 1988 presidential race and, despite the Democrats' best 
efforts, never became a cutting issue -- largely because voters remained 
satisfied with their immediate economic circumstances. It will probably take a 
recession to focus those long-term anxieties enough to affect elections, 
Democratic strategists acknowledge. If that's so, it means Democrats may again 
need an economic reversal to bring the White House into their sights.

WHEN TRADING WITH THE SOVIETS, U.S. GOVERNMENT IS BAD FOR BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sarah C. Carey, Sarah C. Carey is a Washington attorney specializing in 
foreign trade.

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the opening of the Soviet Union as a major new market, despite the 
growing participation of major U.S. players in this market, Washington remains 
a major obstacle to bilateral progress. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of viewing trade as part of the normalization of the relationship -- 
one that brings more benefits to Washington than to Moscow, at least in terms 
of balance of payments -- the U.S. government acts as though trade is a favor, 
a special dispensation to be bestowed only if the Soviets behave as we want 
them to, domestically and internationally. 
</P>
<P>
The United States appears to be suffering from the delusion that by attaching 
strings to trade, similar to the strings typically attached during the '70s on 
federal grants to states and localities, we can influence or direct social and 
economic change in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Travel by U.S. business executives to Moscow and by Soviet businessmen to the 
United States has increased tenfold over the past two years. Some deals have 
been concluded; others are being negotiated in virtually all sectors -- natural 
resource development, energy processing, hotels and tourism, medical equipment, 
chemicals, retail products, publishing, computers and electronics, even food 
processing. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. state and local governments, local chambers of commerce and trade 
associations are exploring the newly opened market with enthusiasm. No 
surprise. The Soviet Union is the world's second-largest economy; it has a 
population of almost 287 million with more rubles than there are products to 
buy, and it possesses the world's largest natural-resource base. 
</P>
<P>
Differences between our two economies frequently make it difficult to structure 
commercial transactions but those difficulties are not insurmountable -- and 
they are not significantly different from difficulties encountered in other 
countries where the national government plays a major role in the economy and 
hard currency is either not available or in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent speech to the U.S.-U.S.S.R Trade and Economic Council, Secretary of 
Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher carried the conditional U.S. government message on 
mutual trade. 
</P>
<P>
He was reiterating the President's position that if the Soviet Union codifies 
its laws "in accordance with international standards" (as determined by the 
United States) and implements them faithfully (as determined by the United 
States), then the Administration will work with Congress for a temporary waiver 
of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. That amendment denies a country 
non-discriminatory tariff treatment if it restricts emigration. This message, 
hardly reassuring to businesses exploring long-term deals, was put forward as a 
major concession. Fortunately, a number of congressmen have introduced 
legislation supporting such a waiver. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher also held out prospects of expanded trade with the Soviets if Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev's government proceeds with price reform, devaluation of the ruble, 
decentralization of economic decision-making -- and other reforms the Soviets 
have already declared as policy objectives to be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
The secretary said, "We welcome the words and the beginning steps. We now look 
for deeds," reflecting an apparent unawareness of radical reforms under way and 
the intensity of Soviet efforts to achieve the very goals he specified. The 
tone of Mosbacher's remarks suggested that the United States was overseeing 
these developments as a sort of umpire, in order to determine whether or not 
U.S. businesses may participate on the newly opened playground. His tone seemed 
condescending and paternalistic. 
</P>
<P>
Mosbacher also went out of the way to encourage Soviet cooperatives, a 
promising new form of private business in the Soviet Union. Because of their 
modest size and lack of manufacturing experience, however, cooperatives are 
often not ideal candidates for partnerships with major U.S. corporations. 
</P>
<P>
The singling out of cooperatives (as opposed to enterprises, amalgamations, 
trading companies or other business organizations), is equivalent to the 
Soviets saying they favor business deals with American ESOPS -- employee 
stock-ownership plans -- because they are owned by the workers. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Mosbacher said at least five times, compounding a tautology, that 
expansion of trade must be on a commercial basis. None of the corporations in 
his audience could be accused of being charitable organizations; each ventures 
into the Soviet market out of economic imperatives. The major element of 
commercial risk in their participation is the United States itself -- with its 
penchant to impede with trade sanctions and export control. 
</P>
<P>
This is the time for the U.S. government to recognize the scope of Soviet 
economic reform in progress, as well as the significant market opportunities 
those reforms present. It is also time to formulate trade policy based on 
economic facts rather than a misperception that Washington can dictate Soviet 
domestic behavior. 
</P>
<P>
An appropriate agenda might include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Renegotiation of a bilateral trade and investment protection treaty, 
similar to the treaties U.S. allies are signing with the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Renegotiation of the bilateral tax treaty (the current tax treaty does not 
cover the new business relationships, such as joint ventures, now permitted in 
the Soviet Union). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Repeal of legislative amendments that deny non-discriminatory tariff 
treatment or that prevent U.S. businesses from access to Export-Import Bank 
guarantees and credits to support deals made in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Streamlining of export controls to release products and technology 
available from other sources and not of direct military application. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Constructive encouragement of Soviet participation in the International 
Monetary Fund and World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Abandonment of the current petulant attitude toward Gorbachev's economic 
and political initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
"Commerce," Benjamin Franklin argued, "is the great civilizer. We exchange 
ideas when we exchange fabrics." Trade provides a lubricant that can relax 
tensions in other fields. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of holding trade hostage to human rights or waiting for the Soviet 
Union to emulate capitalism, the United States should recognize the political 
and economic revolution occurring in the Soviet Union, to help create a level, 
attractive playing field for U.S. companies willing to participate.

INDIA HOLDS THE STICK BUT LACKS A CARROT

India is a power on ascendence in the region and beyond, according to Henry A. 
Kissinger, Time magazine and some influential commentators in Washington. This 
may come as a surprise to many Americans, who till recently saw India as a vast 
sea of human misery. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment Indians are experiencing the joys of exercising primacy in the 
South Asian region. Woes may come, however, sooner than most Indians think. 
</P>
<P>
At the request of the Maldives government, in July, 1988, India sent troops to 
save the regime there from an armed coup. India also keeps "peace" in Sri 
Lanka, and coerces those who defy its regional status with severe reduction in 
the supply of essential commodities to Nepal and persistent diplomatic 
pressures on Pakistan to sever its security links with China and the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
By regional primacy India largely means what it meant to Great Britain -- the 
subcontinent as one strategic entity with India as its security guardian. Delhi 
has always attempted to prevail over its neighbors to shun security links with 
countries outside the region, for it thinks that outside powers deny India its 
natural predominance in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Today India is better able to assert primacy. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi 
commands more military power than did his mother, Indira Gandhi, or his 
grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru. With the fourth-largest army, fifth- or 
sixth-largest air force, the largest navy among the countries of the Indian 
Ocean area and a clear nuclear capability, India occupies an important place in 
the global military hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
But its power is seriously flawed; the world's fourth-largest military 
establishment rests on an economy slightly larger than Spain's. The long-term 
question is whether the world region inhabited by the largest number of 
absolute poor people (as defined by the World Bank) and beset by ethnic and 
religious strife, can be organized into something resembling a regional order 
on the basis of Indian military might alone. 
</P>
<P>
The military engagement in Sri Lanka is by far India's most ambitious 
undertaking since it became sovereign 40 years ago. But after nearly two years 
of involvement, India is nowhere near realizing the purpose for which it 
deployed some 50,000 men. Sri Lanka may well turn out to be an Indian quagmire, 
deeper and more entrapping than what Vietnam turned out to be for the Americans 
or Afghanistan for the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan president, Ranasinghe Premadasa, recently said: "Our desire is 
to see the last Indian soldier leave Sri Lanka by July 29." Two years ago on 
that day his predecessor, Junius R. Jayewardene, invited Indian troops to keep 
peace between the warring Tamil and Sinhala communities of the island. It is 
doubtful whether Sri Lankans can manage, much less resolve, their ethnic 
conflict; but it is certain that Delhi cannot. 
</P>
<P>
A deep gulf divides India and its truculent neighbor, Pakistan, on how to 
organize the security of South Asia. Primacy is the basis of regional security, 
India believes; a rough balance can alone safeguard the independence of small 
countries, Pakistan asserts. It maintains this balance by inviting India's 
adversaries, China and the United States, into the region. 
</P>
<P>
By primacy India does not mean outright subordination of Pakistan, or other 
small neighbors, to its dictates. India would gladly establish a warm 
relationship with Pakistan, if only Pakistan would accept India as the 
custodian of the region. The India-Pakistan relationship could be modeled along 
lines of the U.S.-Canada relationship, India hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan fears that by accepting Indian proposals for peace and good 
neighborliness it would become what Bulgaria is to the Soviet Union. At any 
rate, Benazir Bhutto is perhaps even more determined than was her predecessor, 
Gen. Zia ul-Haq, to resist Indian regional dominance. She could count on the 
United States and China to contain India, for both value Pakistan's strategic 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
No developing country has so doggedly worked to build a regional sphere of 
influence as India. Brazil, Nigeria or Indonesia, for instance, all large in 
comparison with their neighbors, have not really aspired to regional primacy. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from military power, India has little to influence its neighbors 
decisively. Trade and aid are often better and cheaper means of influence than 
military power. The United States and the Soviet Union are successful regional 
powers because they possess such a vast array of the means of power to 
influence their back yards. Moscow and Washington have the capability to reward 
by aid, trade and charity those who recognize their regional primacy and punish 
by interventions those who do not. 
</P>
<P>
India has only the capability to punish -- not reward -- its neighbors. Except 
for Nepal, which is vulnerable to Indian economic influences, Delhi has little 
economic leverage vis-a-vis other countries. By exploiting a neighbor's trade 
dependence, India might succeed in disciplining Nepal. One Nepali official 
called the recent troubles between the two neighbors a conflict between Nepali 
pride and Indian might. Pride might yield to might. 
</P>
<P>
The changing international setting may impede India's pursuit of primacy. Prior 
to the coming of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet Union under Leonid I. 
Brezhnev had come to regard a regionally dominant India as an important partner 
in its competition with the United States and China. 
</P>
<P>
In Gorbachev's scheme for an economically interdependent world, one wonders if 
there is room for an old-fashioned idea like spheres of influence. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev wants to divest his country of some of the burdens of managing East 
Europe. The Sovietsnow invite West German capital in their sphere of influence. 
Thus it is not surprising that some Soviet academics are questioning whether 
India ought to bear the burden of -- or whether it has the capacity for -- 
regional primacy. A recent Soviet statement criticizing India for denying 
essential commodities to Nepal is an indication of changing Soviet attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
India is joins the game just when the match is changing. The old contest of 
strength is now giving way to a new competition for wealth. Military power does 
not count for as much in the new game, but that is all India has.

JAPANESE AND SAVING WHALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Culture: What a wonderful word. It means different things to different people. 
And what a handy word. Particularly for "friends of the United States" such as 
the Japanese. They constantly preach that because we don't understand their 
culture we are unable to trade goods with them. 
</P>
<P>
This clever excuse for one-sided relations has now been refined. Now the 
Japanese line is that they kill whales and need to continue to do so because 
their culture is different from the rest of the world. (And the survival of 
their culture is obviously more important than the survival of the whale as 
species!) 
</P>
<P>
So let's take them up on it! How? By restricting their access to Western 
technology, by denying them favored nation trading privileges, by officially 
proclaiming their outlaw behavior with ocean life and by publicly examining the 
issue of ethics with every aspect of their relations with us. 
</P>
<P>
Short of this, I fear nothing will stop their senseless killing of the whales.

<P>
As reported by The Times, the whale population seems to be in alarmingly low 
numbers and the Japanese, who continue to hunt whales, take on the selfish, 
clannish attitude of their so-called right to eat whale meat. The Japanese, 
despite all of their progress in joining the rest of the world successfully 
economically, have failed on ecological matters. They seem to consider it their 
divine right to decimate these magnificent creatures while at the same time 
turning a deaf ear to world opinion. 
</P>

It has come to the point where I watch my Japanese television, drive my 
Japanese car, and play music on my Japanese piano with deep regret.

CLIMBING EVEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a member of a French expedition to ascend the unclimbed northeast ridge of 
Everest, I read with delight your editorial "Because It Is There" (June 18). It 
romanticizes an activity that draws scant attention by comparison to other 
sports such as basketball or boxing. 
</P>
<P>
Climbing Everest is the unphilosophical abstraction to life itself. The climber 
senses, feels and eventually learns to know this as he struggles for the 
summit. 
</P>
<P>
Our expedition, although small and privately organized, will celebrate the 
bicentennial of the Bill of Rights (Sept. 25, 1989) and the Declaration of 
Human Rights (Aug. 26, 1989) by placing a copy of each document on the summit. 
</P>
<P>
P.S. This, my second unsponsored attempt, has left me broke.

GOVERNMENTS AND DESIRE FOR POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The June 11 collection of front page Opinion articles dramatically reveals the 
darker side of governments around the world: the desire for power and the 
efforts they will make to retain power. 
</P>
<P>
The latest example is China, where our illusions have been totally shattered, 
where we thought that democracy and reforms were the new political system. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States the dynamics are similar and are obviously not limited to 
political institutions. The revelations of corruption and environmental 
degradation start at the top (Rocky Flats, Iran-Contra) and extend to Exxon and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
The desire for power, control and stability are obviously intrinsic to all 
people and institutions worldwide, regardless of the nominal form of 
government. Those decrying socialism or autocratic governments have no cause 
for rejoicing. Our skirts are no cleaner than anyone else's. 
</P>
<P>
The only solution (and one we are fortunate enough to have) is a system where 
citizens are an intrinsic part of the political and economic process. The 
problem with paternalistic governments, whether they be socialistic, 
authoritarian or nominally democratic, is that the average citizen is outside 
of the political process. 
</P>
<P>
When citizen involvement is absent, power becomes concentrated and trouble is 
sure to follow. 
</P>
<P>
The reality seems to be that for political freedom to persist, it is necessary 
that unceasing citizen effort be expanded. We need to vote, participate in the 
political process and most importantly, base our decisions and activities on 
principles that will guarantee political freedom, individual rights and 
environmental integrity. This is very hard work, but we have now a world where 
this kind of work is not being done. The negative results are obvious.

WORDS TO THE WISE ON TEACHER INVOLVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. WILLIAMS and ADRIANNE BANK, Richard C. Williams is a professor of 
education at UCLA and director of Seeds University Elementary School; Adrianne 
Bank is associate director of the school. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its recent contract settlement with the Los Angeles Unified School District, 
the United Teachers of Los Angeles has taken a major step toward its 
long-cherished goal of increasing the teachers' role in local school-site 
decision-making. The contract provision that establishes school councils 
composed of 50% teachers, with authority to make decisions that cannot be 
vetoed by the school principal, could usher in a new era in management for this 
huge, bureaucratically centralized system. 
</P>
<P>
Business leaders realized some time ago that involving employees in 
organizational decision-making is a powerful way to regenerate employee 
performance and satisfaction, thereby improving productivity. Smaller school 
districts have begun to experiment with shared decision-making to reduce 
tensions between teachers and administrators and in forging new solutions to 
seemingly intractable problems. 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, in anticipation of the movement toward school-based 
decision-making, the administrators and teachers of the Corinne A. Seeds 
University Elementary School, the laboratory school of UCLA's Graduate School 
of Education, began exploring how to involve teachers in decision-making as a 
means of reorganizing our school and, thereby, improving the educational 
program. What we have learned should be instructive to those developing the Los 
Angeles school district's participative management program. 
</P>
<P>
We have learned that involving teachers in decision-making produces powerful 
positive outcomes in the classroom and for the school as a whole. The most 
important gain has been better decisions that incorporate the creativity and 
thoughtfulness of many people. It makes sense that the experiences of many 
educators at a school will generate more workable options than the judgments of 
a single administrator or a central administrative unit. 
</P>
<P>
There are other advantages. When teachers participate in making school-wide 
decisions they become more knowledgeable about the choices possible and come to 
understand the interwoven complexities of running a school. Teachers assume a 
greater sense of responsibility and accountability for carrying out decisions 
they have helped shape. By locating decision-making at the school site, 
administrators and teachers can focus their attention on solving problems that 
are unique to their specific situation. There is no question that our effective 
reorganizing efforts at Seeds have benefitted greatly from the teacher 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
However, such teacher involvement did not occur easily or without effort. And 
our experience is consistent with what others have learned when they have tried 
this approach. 
</P>
<P>
The following four issues must be carefully addressed if the schools and school 
district are to reap the benefits of teacher involvement. 
</P>
<P>
Participative decision-making requires lots of time from many people. When more 
people participate in decisions about critical instructional programs, the 
curriculum or how to spend limited funds, time must be made available for 
information sharing, for arguing, for developing and agreeing on solutions. 
Such problems cannot be dealt with in weekly 45-minute meetings. The divergent 
interests of parents, teachers and administrators cannot be accommodated on the 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Collaborative problem-solving skills and attitudes must be nurtured. Many 
teachers,who are accustomed to their own self-contained classrooms, have 
limited experience in working with others to solve school-wide problems. Few 
have professional training that prepares them for participating in continuing 
decision-making and in the long-range planning process. 
</P>
<P>
Conflict resolution techniques must be developed. When administrators, teachers 
and parents interact to resolve problems that have important consequences, 
there is an inevitable increase in the level of interpersonal conflict. All 
participants need to learn how to share ideas and disagree without resorting to 
personal attacks and interest-group politics. They need to learn how to express 
and receive criticism in ways that further constructive decision-making without 
creating destructive polarization. Formats for negotiations and appeals must be 
worked out. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the role of the administrator must be redefined. Administrators who 
are accustomed to managing primarily through the authority of their position 
must become able to work cooperatively through the efforts of others. They must 
know how to listen, to genuinely respect divergent opinions and to encourage 
others to exert leadership. They must be highly skilled at forging true 
consensus rather than settling for temporary compromise. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Unified School District has a participative management scheme 
that could have significant local and national impact. Realizing this 
potential, however, will depend on whether the district provides the support to 
ensure its effective implementation.

A NEW GENERATION LEARNS WHAT COLD WAR WAS ABOUT

<P>
In Hungary, they are correcting history. In Beijing, they are falsifying it. 
</P>
<P>
In Budapest, the government and people are liberating themselves from 
repression and lies. In China, the government is repressing the people and 
lying about it as it stamps out spring. 
</P>
<P>
In 1956, Soviet tanks and troops already in Hungary crushed the Budapest Spring 
as brutally as the Chinese dictators cleared Tian An Men Square. Prime Minister 
Imre Nagy, Jan Peleter and their colleagues were arrested, tried and executed 
as "traitors" and "counterrevolutionaries." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the recent rehabilitation of Nagy indicts his executioners and the 
regime built on those executed. But that regime has already been supplanted by 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
We know now that Orwell was wrong about certain details. It isn't true that 
"who controls the present controls the past." Perfect truth and objectivity are 
not possible in history. 
</P>
<P>
All the details of the deal between Hitler and Stalin may never be known, but 
too much is known about how Stalin conquered and incorporated Latvia, Lithuania 
and Estonia for the truth to be ultimately suppressed. Too much is known about 
how the Soviet army murdered Polish officers in the Katyn Forest. Too much is 
known about what Nagy and Peleter did for Hungary for the official lies to have 
been maintained indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
The truth will out -- about Stalin's great show trials, about the gulag, about 
the Nazi-Soviet pact and its victims, about the Katyn massacres and about the 
"premature" democrats in Hungary who sought to lead their people toward 
democracy and independence before leaders in the Kremlin were ready. 
</P>
<P>
One day, as the future is claimed, the past will be reclaimed.

TO END THIS PLAGUE, IMMUNIZE AGAINST CONCEPTION

<P>
Most Americans are simultaneously pro-choice and anti-abortion. The anti-choice 
movement justifies governmental intrusion into other people's private tragedies 
by asserting an unassailable, God-given "right to life." 
</P>
<P>
The taking of human life is an abomination; one of the few exceptions is when 
that life is no more than putative, when it cannot exist without the vital 
support of another's life. A sperm and an ovum both contain the ingredients for 
human life, but each needs the other to generate life. Therefore, neither 
represents a human life because of their dependence on one another. After 
fertilization a similar, but not identical, relationship pertains to fetus and 
mother. The vital difference is that the mother can live without the fetus 
while the fetus cannot live without the mother. Hence, it is inaccurate 
biologically to consider an early fetus to be a human life. Accuracy requires 
calling it a putative life. Those are biological facts. Outlawing abortion 
would require ignoring those facts. 
</P>
<P>
Such a prohibition of abortion would cross the line of establishing a national 
religion. Dialectics about when life begins -- whether in theological or 
philosophical language -- are nothing more than a biological charade in the 
20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Immutable biological facts clearly conflict with many Americans' religious 
beliefs. Most Americans, however, share a diversity of religions and belief 
systems that encompass the biological reality that early fetuses exist at the 
discretion of the mother. That is not because most Americans are cavalier about 
murder. It is because most Americans know that themother's existence is 
independent of the fetus while the fetus' putative life is umbilically 
dependent on the mother. 
</P>
<P>
To be pro-choice is not to be pro-abortion. The aborting of more than 4,000 
fetuses per day is an abomination. But there is a humane, albeit theoretical, 
approach that would markedly reduce that appalling number. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of Americans share beliefs and values that consider bringing 
unwanted babies into this world as more unethical than the abortion of a 
non-viable fetus that is unwanted. Our values will change as soon as our 
society implements reliable plans to care for those 1.5 million unwanted 
fetuses per year and backs it with support services for the significant 
percentage doomed to experience major problems. Suggesting adoption is an 
agreeable-sounding alternative. Unfortunately, it is totally unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
Until our society makes a valid commitment to those putative lives, is it not 
more moral to leave the choice to the mother? 
</P>
<P>
If unwanted pregnancies and abortion represent a plague in our land, shouldn't 
we consider immunization against it? Why not challenge scientists at the 
National Institutes of Health to develop a reversible means of immunizing every 
infant against conception? Of course, reversal of the immunization would have 
to be readily available in response to a mature request. As draconian as this 
fantasy may seem, sober reflection underscores that its purpose is nothing more 
than to interject thought before passionate procreation. It would not interfere 
with any right other than the dubious right to thoughtless pregnancy. It would 
enhance rationaldecision-making. Nothing would be guaranteed other than each 
newborn would have been wanted at one time (which, when contrasted with the 
current circumstances, could markedly decrease the frequency of child abuse, 
neglect and a host of other psychosocial problems.) 
</P>
<P>
Those under the banner of "right to life" argue that our perspective is biased 
in favor of the mother's rights as compared to fetal rights. True. The 
biological reality mandates that "bias." But with anti-pregnancy immunization 
there would be no one demanding fetal rights in potentially fatal conflict with 
the mother. Those fetuses that did develop would stand an infinitely better 
chance of an enduring and harmonious right to life. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of the larger biological, psychological and social reality, we assign 
primacy to a newborn's right to be wanted and cared for. That stems from 
decades of trying to treat the results of the cruelty of bringing babies into a 
world in which there is no adult ready to care for a helpless baby. In that 
context, we join the President's goal of a kinder, gentler America. 
</P>
<P>
Just as a nation can be judged by how it treats its weakest, a belief system or 
religion can be judged by how it requires its adherents to serve its God and 
also by how it defends the rights of non-believers. 
</P>
<P>
In light of the biological realities, the question facing the Supreme Court is 
whether it is willing to risk moving this country towards a theocracy in which 
the majority will not be permitted legally to offend others' beliefs by the 
freedom to elect to abort putative life.

A NEW GENERATION LEARNS WHAT COLD WAR WAS ABOUT

<TEXT>
<P>
However injurious it is to American national pride, the fact remains that the 
direction of the Chinese leadership is not tempered by the righteous protest of 
foreigners. Certainly not by the righteous protest of Americans. Within hours 
of the Bush Administration's appeal for clemency for demonstrators sentenced to 
death, the Chinese government responded with bullets to the back of the head. 
An American writ that does not extend to Panama City will not extend to 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese authorities would have been undeterred even by America at its 
zenith. When it comes to matters of state, most dictatorships are impervious to 
foreign protest. And for the Chinese communists, the democracy movement was the 
ultimate matter of state: a threat to the very existence of the regime. 
</P>
<P>
If we cannot influence events, why then sanctions? As in the case of South 
Africa, it is important to have no illusions about sanctions. They will not 
materially help the people we want to help. The main purpose for sanctions, in 
China as in South Africa, is internal: to make us feel that we have expressed 
moral outrage in some more-than-rhetorical way. It is entirely correct for a 
nation dedicated to a proposition to express itself on issues of international 
morality. But such actions are not to be confused with diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping has made it clear that politics takes precedence over economics. 
He knew full well what repression would cost in terms of economic development. 
Yet for the sake of power, the ultimate Marxist-Leninist value, he decided to 
pay it. 
</P>
<P>
These costs have been most clearly on display in Poland following the smashing 
of Solidarity in 1981. The resulting scenario is this: The regime retains 
power, but the population refuses to cooperate. A sullen work force, an 
alienated intellectual class, a general suspicion produce economic stagnation. 
That is the real economic cost of repression. Western sanctions -- which, in 
any case, can confidently be predicted to be short term, given the West's 
attention span -- add only marginally to the cost. 
</P>
<P>
The East European model is worth keeping in mind because in much of the 
coverage of China the impression is given that the current repression is a 
peculiarly Chinese tragedy. In fact, the reign of terror is not uniquely 
Chinese, but characteristically communist -- from the massive propaganda 
campaign, the show trials, the forced confessions, the encouragement of family 
members to turn one another in, right down to the invocation endlessly repeated 
in the media to "Love the Party." 
</P>
<P>
Now that Soviet communism has adopted a human face, the baby-boom generation 
has a hard time recalling what the Cold War was about. A popular revisionism 
holds that the Cold War was a cherished project of the American right that fed 
on a mutual paranoia. In fact, China has dramatically recreated precisely the 
kind of forces America fought during 40 years of the great twilight struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Which is what makes Tian An Men Square an important event not just in Chinese 
but in Western consciousness. It is the first time that this generation -- too 
young to remember Budapest, 1956, too distracted to notice Prague, 1968, too 
far removed to fully absorb the Vietnamese gulag and the Cambodian genocide of 
the '70s -- has finally been directly exposed to the meaning of 
Marxist-Leninism.

FOOTLOOSE: PORT OF HAMBURG OFFERS MORE THAN EELS AND BEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYER and ED RABEY, Beyer and Rabey are Los Angeles travel writers. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HAMBURG, West Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If anyone here says that a location you seek is "by the bridge," you'd better 
ask for specifics. This city has 2,400 of them, more than Venice, or anywhere 
else in Europe for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
That's because Hamburg sits on the Elbe River and several of its tributaries, 
most notably the Alster, which swells to the beautiful mid-city "lake" that is 
one of Hamburg's scenic attractions. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its up-river location 68 miles from the North Sea, Hamburg still has 
Germany's largest harbor. 
</P>
<P>
But the city's chief virtues to visitors are its miles of canals lined with 
glorious linden and chestnut trees, a springtime halo of forsythia and lilac, 
magnificent architecture spanning the centuries, plus a lively cultural scene. 
</P>
<P>
Take a sightseeing boat to the middle of Alster lake and look back toward the 
Old Town. Six soaring steeples of old churches and the old city hall grace a 
skyline that looks like a 19th-Century steel engraving of a German city on a 
Christmas card. 
</P>
<P>
Getting here: Fly Lufthansa nonstop to Frankfurt and on to Hamburg. Pan Am and 
Air New Zealand also fly nonstop to Frankfurt; American, Delta, TWA and 
Northwest get you here with changes. Lufthansa is the only airline flying 
Frankfurt-Hamburg. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? Give the town at least two full days, another if you can 
spare it. Even with the dollar's recent surge, prices for lodging and dining 
are rather expensive. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: The deutsche mark recently sold for two to the dollar. Best 
times for a visit are late spring or late fall, the shoulder seasons, when the 
city is a wonderland of color. Ride buses or the clean, efficient and rapid 
underground system to almost any destination. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Hotel Abtei (Abteistrasse 14; $72 to $107 double) is a 
stately 19th-Century town house converted a decade ago into a most comfortable 
and homelike hotel. Abtei is crammed with lovely antique furniture, fine rugs, 
old clocks, chandeliers and silver. 
</P>
<P>
You can have breakfast or afternoon tea amid waves of flowers and greenery in a 
snug little garden. Fifteen minutes from the city center, Hotel Abtei is an 
absolute delight. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel St. Raphael (Adenauerallee 41; $75-$90 double) is conveniently near the 
main railway station. Although it is modern from entrance to rooftop, the cozy 
lobby has an open fireplace, gorgeous grandfather clock and touches of 
traditional style. 
</P>
<P>
St. Raphael has a fine restaurant with excellent local dishes, plus a pool, 
Jacuzzi and workout room with a view of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Reichshof (Kirchenallee 34; $106-$136 double) sits just across from the 
train station and has a huge old-fashioned Edwardian lobby. Bedrooms are also 
large and have every possible amenity. 
</P>
<P>
Reichshof's first chef was a cook on a luxury ocean liner, and the 
marble-columned dining room has original wood paneling and carvings from the 
ship, the Cap Polonia. It's a warm and handsome room, with a menu of superb 
seafood and traditional Hamburg dishes. The tiny and romantic Art Deco bar is 
also enchanting. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: Seafood is especially good here, particularly eel, 
which is considerably less salty than its Mediterranean cousin. Eel soup is a 
hearty affair, with prunes and other dried fruit mixed with vegetables and 
spices to give it a sweet-and-sour taste. 
</P>
<P>
Labskaus, a traditional sailor's hash, won't appear on menus in fancy 
restaurants because it's a hodgepodge of leftover vegetables, meat and/or fish 
topped with a fried egg. It will surely keep you going until supper. 
Finkenwerder is another local staple: Gargantuan fillets of plaice fried or 
sauteed. 
</P>
<P>
Hamburg once brewed more beer than any city in Germany, a fact Bavarians still 
find hard to take, but the best has now been winnowed down to Holsten and St. 
Pauli. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: Bobby Reich's, on the banks of the Alster, is a meeting place for 
all Hamburg. This combination restaurant-cafe is set on a jetty where sun 
worshipers bask outside during a lunch or late breakfast of herculean 
proportions. Konigsberger klopse, a rather large minced meatball with sauce, is 
a house specialty, as is eisbeinsulze, pork leg roasted and served with kraut. 
</P>
<P>
The decor of the Old Commercial Room (Englische Planke 10) is so nautical that 
you might get a bit queasy just looking at all the binnacles, maps, marine 
prints and assorted shipboard gear. Founded in 1648, it's the place to go for 
labskaus, eel soup and other typical hamburgische Kuche. 
</P>
<P>
Fischerhaus (St. Pauli Fischmarkt 14) is a no-nonsense place to warm your 
heart, with gigantic platters of fish (fried, broiled, sauteed or poached) 
going by your table, wafting an aromatic cloud of temptation. 
</P>
<P>
It has the freshest fish in Hamburg and is a favorite of both local swells and 
tattoo-adorned seamen from the docks just across the road. Fischerhaus will 
serve you enough fish to get you through Lent for about $15. 
</P>
<P>
Going first-class: By any standard and a number of polls, Vier Jahreszeiten 
(Neuer Jungfernstieg 9; $178-$223 double) is among the two or three best hotels 
in the world and some proclaim it unmatched in Europe. It certainly is 
Germany's finest. 
</P>
<P>
To this chorus of accolades we would add that it is difficult not to enthuse 
over a lofty level of personal service seldom encountered, elegant furnishings 
of museum quality and a gorgeous dining room that merits its Michelin star and 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Vier Jahreszeiten counts Gobelin tapestries among its many treasures. Antiques 
are all original, and two dozen red roses or seasonal flowers in each bedroom 
come from its own nursery. 
</P>
<P>
The 45,000-bottle wine cellar furnishes a formidable selection of fine 
vintages. The wine also is sold to many of the best restaurants and hotels 
throughout Europe, another reason that few hotels measure up to this 
century-old paragon. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Start your appreciation of this lovely city by taking one of the 
sightseeing boats for an hour's cruise of the Alster and the narrow, 
willow-lined canals that lace the town. 
</P>
<P>
Now take the old-fashioned Hummelbahn train that makes the rounds of most city 
attractions, with stops for picture-taking and browsing. You'll go through the 
lusty St. Pauli District with its infamous Reeperbahn of bars, pubs and sex 
shows; visit the magnificent, 18th-Century baroque St. Michael's Church, a city 
treasure; stop at the port for a snack of pickled herring or eel, then stop 
again at a courtyard of the Old Town for a glass of wine and stroll by the 
ancient homes and shops of Hamburg. 
</P>
<P>
And save time for a shopping spree among the malls and arcades around 
Jungfernstieg, said to be the best collection of elegant stores and pricey 
goods in Germany. 
</P>
<P>

TRIP OF THE WEEK: SKUNK LINE STEAMS BACK INTO SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A familiar whistle is echoing through this logging town again. It's the salute 
from Ol' No. 45, the smoking steam locomotive of the famed Skunk Line that's 
back on track after a two-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
The vintage iron horse has a rebuilt boiler and is once more puffing its way 
with carloads of sightseers through the redwood forests of Mendocino County. 
Diesel-powered locomotives and rail cars also ply the Route of the Redwoods, 
but the steam train is an excellent way to go. Beginning this weekend, visitors 
can take a nostalgic ride behind the 65-year-old Baldwin locomotive every 
Friday and Saturday through Sept. 9. Other steam train trips are scheduled on 
Sept. 23 and Oct. 7 and 21. 
</P>
<P>
Reminiscent of times gone by, puffs of white steam cloud the sky while a long 
whistle announces the departure of the Super Skunk. Kids in engineer caps wave 
from the windows as the great maroon engine chugs out of Ft. Bragg. 
</P>
<P>
"Tickets, please!" calls out the red-vested conductor from the front of the 
first passenger car. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pudding Creek 
</P>
<P>
Then he uses the train's public-address system to introduce the other crew 
members (engineer, fireman and brakeman), announce that smoking is prohibited 
and begin pointing out sights along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Paralleling century-old rails used by the original logging trains, the tracks 
lead almost immediately into the woods to follow the course of Pudding Creek 
and the Noyo River. Beyond Milepost 3.5 is the entrance to an 1,100-foot unlit 
tunnel that took Chinese laborers two years to dig in the 1890s. 
</P>
<P>
"Close all windows to keep smoke out of the coaches," announces the conductor. 
"And no necking in the tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
After the train emerges, passengers are allowed to go to a roofless observation 
car in the middle of the train. There are no seats, so it's easy to maneuver to 
a good position for taking pictures of the passing scenery. 
</P>
<P>
On either side are huge trunks of felled redwoods and new stands of timber and 
ferns covering the forest floor. Besides a few vacation cabins and children's 
summer camps, the woods are inhabited mostly by wildlife, including rabbits, 
deer and an occasional bear. Look for osprey and great blue herons, too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Into the Woods 
</P>
<P>
The 43-mile round trip runs from Ft. Bragg deep into the woods to the 
turnaround station at Northspur. Passengers disembark for refreshments while 
the steam engine is switched to the opposite end of the train and refilled with 
water for the return trip. 
</P>
<P>
If Ol' No. 45 is booked up during your visit, there also are twice-daily 
excursions powered by historic diesel locomotives. In winter the trips are made 
in 50- and 69-passenger rail cars. 
</P>
<P>
Dating back to 1885, the Skunk Line began as a railroad that hauled logs to 
timber mills on the coast at Ft. Bragg. After the turn of the century, 
passenger service was begun to take townsfolk on Sunday outings in the woods. 
</P>
<P>
Soon the tracks of the California Western Railroad were extended to Willits, 
where passengers could connect with stagecoaches to San Francisco. Steam-train 
service ended in 1925 when single, self-powered rail cars were introduced. 
</P>
<P>
People said you could smell their gas-fueled engines long before you would see 
the rail cars, and that's when the railroad became known as the Skunk Line. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Super Skunk 
</P>
<P>
After excursions on the bright yellow rail cars became a popular attraction in 
the 1960s, it was decided to put a steam train back into service. The Super 
Skunk, made up of restored locomotive No. 45 and four passenger coaches from 
the Erie-Lackawanna line, began sightseeing runs in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Due to mechanical breakdowns, increased operating costs and a change in the 
railroad's ownership, steam-train service has been sporadic since 1980. But the 
Mendocino County Railway Society was formed and it has succeeded in 
reestablishing steam-locomotive excursions on a regular schedule this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Ol' No. 45 departs Fridays and Saturdays at 9:20 a.m. and 1:35 p.m., with extra 
rail cars capable of accommodating up to 460 passengers. Steaming to speeds of 
15 to 20 m.p.h., the train's round trip to Northspur takes three hours. On 
other days the coaches and open observation cars are pulled by a diesel 
locomotive. 
</P>
<P>
The steam or diesel excursion costs $16, children 5 though 11 years $8, under 
age 5 free. 
</P>
<P>
Rail buffs who would like to make the entire 40-mile run to Willits can change 
trains at Northspur and continue via diesel locomotive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Daylong Journey 
</P>
<P>
If you take the morning train it's possible to make a round trip to Willits in 
the same day, returning to Ft. Bragg at 4:35 p.m. The fare is $20, children 
$10. (Diesel trains also make twice-daily round trips from Willits to 
Northspur.) 
</P>
<P>
For a full schedule of the Skunk Line excursions, call (707) 964-6371 or write 
to California Western Railroad, P.O. Box 907L, Ft. Bragg, Calif. 95437. 
Reservations are recommended for any trip, steam or diesel; call the same 
number. 
</P>
<P>
The Skunk depot in Ft. Bragg is at Laurel Avenue just off California 1 (Main 
Street). 
</P>
<P>
From Los Angeles, drive to San Francisco, then follow U.S. 101 north beyond 
Cloverdale to join California 126 west. When it meets the Coast Highway at 
Navarro River Beach, continue north on California 1 past Mendocino to Ft. 
Bragg. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Logging Museum 
</P>
<P>
While you're in town, visit the Guest House Museum adjacent to the depot. 
Exhibits in the three-story Victorian home recall the area's early logging and 
railroading days. Hours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday. 
Admission $1. 
</P>
<P>
Across from the depot at the North Coast Brewing Co., 444 S. Main St., you can 
enjoy sandwiches and salads with beer made and sold only at the brewery. Try a 
dry stout called Old No. 45. 
</P>
<P>
For more information about dining, lodging and attractions, call the Ft. 
Bragg-Mendocino Coast Chamber of Commerce at (707) 964-3153, or write to P.O. 
Box 1141, Ft. Bragg, Calif. 95437. 
</P>
<P>
Round trip from Los Angeles for a train ride along the Route of the Redwoods 
from Ft. Bragg is 1,072 miles.

THE MATURE TRAVELER: FT. LAUDERDALE APPEALS TO MORE THAN STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HANK KOVELL, Kovell is a veteran journalist in seniors' interests. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A strong bid for mature travelers is being made by Ft. Lauderdale on Florida's 
Gold Coast. 
</P>
<P>
For years the city attracted attention when thousands of disorderly college 
students flocked there for spring break, an event commemorated by both a 
popular song and a hit film, "Where the Boys Are." 
</P>
<P>
To combat the negative image created by the boisterous collegians, the 
community passed and strictly enforced strong laws that have effectively 
limited the rowdy behavior. 
</P>
<P>
While large numbers of young people still enjoy the long stretches of white 
beach, the city also appeals to a wide range of age groups, the mature traveler 
in particular. 
</P>
<P>
Broward County, which includes the cities of Ft. Lauderdale, Deerfield Beach, 
Hollywood and Pompano Beach, boasts 23 miles of clean, white Atlantic Ocean 
beach, where water temperatures average 75 degrees and visitors can expect 330 
days of sunshine annually. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Landscaped Beaches 
</P>
<P>
Beaches are handsomely landscaped and offer nicely maintained picnic areas, 
public restrooms, open-air showers and lifeguard stations that also serve as 
information centers. 
</P>
<P>
Some hotels and many attractions now offer incentives to the mature traveler. 
The Embassy Suites Hotel in Deerfield Beach was among the first to offer 
discounts for seniors. All suites have a living room, bedroom, complimentary 
coffee and tea service, refrigerator and bar. A full breakfast is included 
daily, as well as a two-hour cocktail hour each evening. 
</P>
<P>
Until Dec. 15 the hotel is offering a $10-a-day room discount for seniors, 
which means ocean-front suites for $150, ocean-view suites for $109 and 
Intracoastal Waterway views for $89. (Because of the Intracoastal Waterway and 
the many man-made canals for houses, some have dubbed Ft. Lauderdale the 
"Venice of America.") 
</P>
<P>
For a brochure, information or reservations, write to Embassy Suites, 950 S.E. 
20th Ave., Deerfield Beach, Fla. 33441, or call collect: (305) 426-0478. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hotel Discounts 
</P>
<P>
Most major hotel and motel chains in the Ft. Lauderdale area also offer 
discounts. Sheraton has two beach properties -- the Yankee Trader and the 
Yankee Clipper -- and one in the city center that offers seniors a 25% 
discount. 
</P>
<P>
Ramada Inns has properties in the nearby communities of Deerfield, Pompano 
Beach and Sunrise, all of which also offer a 25% senior discount. 
</P>
<P>
Days Inns, at the airport, in downtown Ft. Lauderdale and at two beach 
locations, have 10% discounts available for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
At Marriott Hotels, senior discounts vary. For the Harbor Beach resort the 
regular rate of $130 is reduced to $80 for two persons if they are members of 
AARP. Marriott's Ft. Lauderdale Intracoastal Hotel and Marina offers a $69 rate 
for seniors for a room that lists at $120. At Marriott Cypress Creek in the 
wildlife preserve the rate is $59 for two, down from $124. 
</P>
<P>
Best Western properties are individually owned, so prices vary. The Marina Inn 
&amp; Yacht Harbor in Port Everglades quotes a room and full breakfast for two 
at $57.60, while the Oceanside offers room and breakfast for $49.50 per couple. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday Inns have nine properties in the area, all of which give a 10% discount 
off the published room rates for AARP members. 
</P>
<P>
Hilton Hotels has two properties in the Ft. Lauderdale area that offer the 
Hilton Senior Honors program, which provides discounts for senior travelers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variety of Activities 
</P>
<P>
Broward County offers a wide range of activities, including sports events, art, 
sightseeing, music, dance and theater. Some of the places that offer discounts 
for seniors are: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pompano Harness Race Track, which charges a nominal 75 cents for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ft. Lauderdale Museum of Art, with frequently changing exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Buehler Planetarium, offering shows on the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Butterfly World, a center for butterfly breeding where you can take a tour 
or stroll among the many beautiful species in screened aviaries while enjoying 
the lavish gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 -- International Swimming Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Discounts are also in effect for Sea Escape, which offers one-day cruises to 
the Bahamas that include three meals, entertainment, all shipboard activities 
-- casino, swimming, dancing or bingo -- plus hotel pickup and return. 
</P>
<P>
Other cruises are day "Cruises to Nowhere" and daytime or evening "Sampler 
Cruises." Senior prices for Sea Escape cruises range from $44 per person. 
Details and descriptions of these and other cruises are available from travel 
agents or by calling toll-free (800) 327-7400. Reservations can usually be made 
while in Ft. Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Festivals and Shows 
</P>
<P>
Festivals and special events are scheduled throughout the year, and many offer 
senior discounts. A typical month might include a boat show, horse and buggy 
show, festival of the arts, sidewalk fairs, fishing derbies, arts and crafts 
shows and traditional holiday celebrations and observances. 
</P>
<P>
Illustrated brochures on Ft. Lauderdale and environs are available at no 
charge. Also offered is the "Greater Ft. Lauderdale Vacation Guide," which 
includes a listing of hotels and motels and price ranges. 
</P>
<P>
You can also ask for the Ft. Lauderdale calendar of events and a theme map 
showing the location of all major tourist attractions, including golf courses, 
tennis courts, state and regional parks and reef sites for snorkelers and scuba 
divers.

CREW RECALLS DIXIE CLIPPER'S FLIGHT INTO HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was early afternoon when the crowd began to gather along the shore of Long 
Island's Manhasset Bay. 
</P>
<P>
By 1:30, several thousand New Yorkers were straining to catch a glimpse of the 
gray leviathan bobbing gently on the waves at Port Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The giant flying boat, the words "Dixie Clipper" painted on her bow and "Pan 
American Airways System" on her fuselage, was about to take to the air on a 
journey into history. 
</P>
<P>
The date was June 28, 1939, and the first aerial transatlantic passenger 
crossing soon would begin. 
</P>
<P>
Almost half a century later there are those who remember that afternoon as if 
it were yesterday, men who made the flight from Port Washington to Marseilles. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert B. (Gib) Blackmore is 85 and living in retirement in Tacoma, Wash. He 
was second in command on the historic trip. Robert Fordyce is 80 and lives in 
Manhattan, N.Y. He was one of the four flight officers on the Dixie Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
The youngest of a trio of crew members interviewed by The Times is Stephen 
Kitchell, 76, of St. Augustine, Fla. Kitchell was an assistant engineer on the 
inaugural flight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'The Greatest Airplane' 
</P>
<P>
The details have become a little hazy, not surprisingly, but all three have 
fond memories of both the journey and the Boeing 314 aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, hell, they were wonderful, the greatest airplane of their day," said 
Blackmore, who was a captain in 1939 but who was being checked out on that 
flight as a first officer. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the gray Dixie Clipper was an imposing sight as it sat there waiting 
for its crew of 12 and 22 passengers to board. Weighing close to 42 tons, it 
was 109 feet long, 28 1/2 feet high and had a wingspan of 152 feet. The carrier 
seemed huge and ponderous, but was anything but. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a beautiful airplane, either to fly in or to work on," said Kitchell. 
"A super airplane." 
</P>
<P>
While Kitchell and a couple of other crew members went through their preflight 
checks, the Dixie Clipper waited. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roar of Engines 
</P>
<P>
First there were the ceremonies to get out of the way. Photographers busily 
snapped shots of crew and passengers alike; speeches were read; a band played; 
the passengers bid excited farewells to friends and relatives and, on the 
water, yachtsmen positioned themselves to see the takeoff better. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, all was ready. 
</P>
<P>
The Dixie Clipper's four giant engines coughed into life at 1:59 p.m. and it 
started to taxi across the bay. As the band played on and the crowd of 5,000 
cheered, it rose into the sky, the roar of its engines drowning out the gun 
salutes from four yacht clubs and the whistles from the craft in the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
In The Times the next morning, the Associated Press described the scene this 
way: 
</P>
<P>
"With the ship's departure at 2:12 p.m. on a 4,650-mile flight, aviation's 
long-cherished dream of regular transatlantic passenger service by plane became 
a reality." 
</P>
<P>
Well, not immediately. It would be 42 hours and 10 minutes before Capt. Robert 
Oliver Daniel Sullivan landed the Dixie Clipper in the French port of 
Marseilles. The flying boat had, after all, a top cruising speed of only 150 
m.p.h., and it had to stop for fuel along the way. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Southern Route 
</P>
<P>
The name Dixie Clipper was bestowed on the plane because of the southern route 
it flew to Europe: first to Horta in the Azores, then on to Lisbon in Portugal, 
where the crew and passengers spent the night in a hotel, and finally on a 
curving path around the Portuguese and Spanish coasts and across the 
Mediterranean to Marseilles. It was not allowed to fly the overland route 
because the Spanish Civil War was still in progress. 
</P>
<P>
(Pan Am, which had started transpacific passenger service in 1935 using the 
famed China Clipper, had two other flying boats on the Atlantic run: the 
ill-fated Yankee Clipper, which usually flew the northern route via 
Newfoundland and Ireland to Southampton, England, and the Atlantic Clipper. 
</P>
<P>
(Twenty-five minutes after the Dixie Clipper took off from Port Washington, the 
Yankee Clipper landed at Southampton, thereby inaugurating regular mail service 
between the United States and Great Britain.) 
</P>
<P>
Because of the length of the journey -- it took 15 hours and 55 minutes just to 
reach Horta in the Azores -- a large crew was necessary, consisting of the 
captain, four flight officers, one engineering officer, two assistant 
engineers, two radio officers and two stewards. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Six Women Aboard 
</P>
<P>
Female flight crew members were still an idea for the future, but there were 
six women among the 22 passengers, including, according to the Associated 
Press, "Mrs. Clara Adams of Maspeth, N.Y., a veteran of history-making flights 
(who) planned to keep on going after she reached Europe and to circle the world 
on regular passenger planes. She expected to arrive home in 16 days." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the passengers were wealthy, well-known or both. They included C. V. 
Whitney, the chairman of Pan Am, railroad executive W. J. Eck, who had applied 
eight years earlier to be on the first transatlantic passenger flight, and 
Louis Gimbel of Gimbel's department store. The crew had good reason to remember 
the latter. 
</P>
<P>
"Pan American gave all the passengers a silver cigarette case (embossed) with a 
facsimile of the ticket," Kitchell said. "Mr. Gimbel was showing us his and he 
said, 'What do yours look like?' and we said, 'Well, we didn't get any.' And he 
had them made up for each of the crew. I've still got mine. It has (the words) 
'First Transatlantic Passenger Flight' and my name on it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1939 Timetable 
</P>
<P>
Another of Kitchell's souvenirs is a 1939 timetable for the twice-weekly 
Clipper flights to Europe. The one-way fare from New York, he said, was $309 to 
Lisbon and $375 to Marseilles. 
</P>
<P>
Like today's Concorde passengers, those who took the flight were paying for 
speed as much as anything. Until the Dixie Clipper came along, the fastest way 
across the Atlantic was aboard the Queen Mary, which had made the sea voyage in 
1938 in a record 3 days, 20 hours, 42 minutes. Compared to that, 42 hours 
seemed a breeze. 
</P>
<P>
The flying boat could carry up to 40 passengers, so the 22 aboard on this trip 
had more than enough room. Everything was first-class, with the interior of the 
aircraft paneled in wood and each compartment and the main salon having windows 
from which to take in the view. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Honeymoon Compartment' 
</P>
<P>
The forward compartment just below the flight deck was the crew's rest 
quarters, while the rear compartment was nicknamed the "honeymoon compartment" 
for reasons best not examined here. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was so excited, even the passengers, that I don't think they slept 
much," Kitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers and crew mingled freely when the latter were off duty. In those days 
before in-flight movies or music, there wasn't much else to do but read, talk, 
write letters or play bridge or chess. 
</P>
<P>
Or look forward to the next meal. The food on board was excellent -- no frozen 
dinners then. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Dixie Clipper's first passenger-carrying flight, crew members had 
made several survey flights to check into optimum routes and conditions. 
Stewards had been sent out on those flights to find the best hotels and 
restaurants and the best stores to restock the galley. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you, we ate high off the hog on those flights," Kitchell recalled. 
"They (the stewards) were first-class cooks to start with. They had to cook 
everything from scratch. There were no microwaves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Just Like a Ship 
</P>
<P>
"The food was terrific. You talk about French restaurants -- they had it. They 
(the passengers) sat down at tables just like on a ship. It was quite a setup, 
a far cry from today." 
</P>
<P>
Did the inaugural flight produce anything out of the ordinary? 
</P>
<P>
"No, nothing really," said Fordyce. "It never did. Of course, it was not 
supposed to." 
</P>
<P>
Then again, what may have been routine for the crew in 1939 seems particularly 
strange to airline passengers half a century later. 
</P>
<P>
Just the idea of traveling across the world by flying boat, of landing in the 
Atlantic Ocean, then on the Tagus River in Lisbon and, finally, in the harbor 
at Marseilles appears intriguing today. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, Fordyce explained matter-of-factly, flying the Dixie Clipper "was just 
a matter of taking off or landing a boat, so to speak." 
</P>
<P>
By today's technological standards, however, that "boat" was relatively 
primitive. Take navigation, for example. Today's airline passengers would 
surely think twice about seeing flares tossed from their plane. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Celestial Navigation 
</P>
<P>
"They (the flares) were used as a drift indicator," Kitchell explained. "In 
other words, you'd line them up with the waves and they would tell you which 
way the waves were going in relation to the airplane, and that would give you 
your drift. 
</P>
<P>
"Then of course back aft they had a dome where the navigator would take 
celestial sights. It was all done the old-fashioned way, just like a ship. A 
far cry from now." 
</P>
<P>
Communication, too, was a lot different. 
</P>
<P>
"We had two radio operators on board and we kept in contact with everybody," 
Blackmore said. "For the first 150 miles out we could have voice 
communications. After that, we were on CW (Morse code)." 
</P>
<P>
Usually the Clippers would fly at about 8,000 feet. On occasion, though, they 
would be considerably lower. 
</P>
<P>
"We had one captain who used to fly very low," Kitchell recalled with a laugh. 
"One time a passenger came up and wanted to know how we checked the altitude, 
and he (the captain) said, 'Oh, I just open the window and put my finger out, 
and if I taste salt, I climb a hundred feet.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wave-Hopping 
</P>
<P>
There was some wave-hopping on the return leg of the inaugural flight, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
"We were flying at around 500 feet to keep away from the head winds," Kitchell 
said, "when we saw this boat way ahead of us all lit up and everything. Then 
they heard the airplane and, boy, it was black. I mean they turned everything 
off. Of course, this was back in 1939 (when fear of war was justifiably high)." 
</P>
<P>
Fordyce recalled another aspect of traveling aboard the Clippers that would 
also startle today's passengers. 
</P>
<P>
"They were quite a fabulous plane," he said. "As a matter of fact, they were 
the only planes I've ever seen where somebody could walk out into the wing and 
change the generator on an engine. 
</P>
<P>
"There were times (during a flight) when we used to do that, which was rather 
extraordinary. It wasn't at all dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
Kitchell, the engineer, explained how it was done. 
</P>
<P>
"You had two doors, one on each side, and you could go right out in the wing," 
he said. "We crawled out on a catwalk inside the wing and changed a magneto one 
time. Just stopped the engine and put a new magneto on. You were right inside 
the airplane, you could pull the fire wall off and there was the back of the 
engine." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Landing in Azores 
</P>
<P>
Despite such antics, passengers seemed to feel safer crossing the ocean in a 
flying boat than they might have in a conventional aircraft, Kitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had been forced down in the ocean, we would probably not have lasted too 
long," he said. "But the fact that you took off from water and landed on water 
was just a confidence builder. Today, a 747 would float much longer." 
</P>
<P>
The first leg of the flight ended with an ocean landing in the Azores between 
the islands of Faial and Pico. It went without a hitch on the inaugural flight, 
but sometimes the waves caused difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times the swells were so big that it was real bad," Kitchell said. 
"(But) the captain on that trip, Sullivan, was an expert in taking off and 
landing in swells. He had a knack of just riding those swells until all of a 
sudden he'd call back to us, 'Give us the power,' and we'd give him full power 
and off we'd go. But he had a knack, a sixth sense of feeling the swells as we 
came in." 
</P>
<P>
(It is one of history's small ironies that it was Sullivan, the pilot with the 
sixth sense about water landings, who crashed the Yankee Clipper while landing 
on the Tagus in Lisbon less than four years later. 
</P>
<P>
(The accident caused two dozen deaths, but among those passengers who were 
rescued was singer/actress Jane Froman, whose battle to recover from her 
injuries later became the subject of the 1952 film "With a Song in My Heart.") 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turnout in Lisbon 
</P>
<P>
After a 1-hour, 24-minute refueling stop in Horta (the 4,200 gallons of fuel 
aboard were not enough for the whole trip) the Dixie Clipper took off again, 
this time for Lisbon, where it arrived 6 hours, 44 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a big turnout when we arrived in Lisbon," Kitchell recalled. "There 
was a band, and the mayor was there and there were probably other dignitaries. 
They had a big banquet that night for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Refreshed by the layover of 1 hour, 26 minutes, the crew and passengers set off 
on the morning of June 30 on the last leg to Marseilles, landing at the harbor 
there at 1:21 p.m. local time. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the historic journey had taken 42 hours, 10 minutes, including 29 hours 
and 20 minutes of flying time. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back now, 50 years later, Fordyce, Kitchell and Blackmore would not 
have missed it for the world. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an interesting time," Kitchell said. "People missed a lot who didn't 
get involved in that." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," agreed Blackmore, "it was fun while it lasted."

As frequent visitors to Cabo San Lucas, our experience has been totally 
different from criticism that appeared in your Letters section recently. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are not sky high in most places. We were there in May and had many 
delicious meals for under $10. Cabo is still a place of great natural beauty 
with a superior climate and a picturesque bay, crystal-clear water and clean, 
uncrowded beaches. It's so inviting and romantic that we can't wait for our 
next trip.

SMOKE DETECTORS

<TEXT>
<P>
As a fellow pariah, I enjoyed the letter from R. W. de Vries about smoking in 
Europe (June 11), especially in France. There is an even better place for 
smokers. In Turkey it seems one is always offered a cigarette, together with 
the inevitable glass of tea, as one of the many gestures of friendship and 
hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
And on domestic flights in Turkey, there is no such thing as a no-smoking 
section. Hooray -- this will keep most Americans out of Turkey and it is one of 
the few places left abroad where one can have a wonderful holiday for very 
little money and without running into a lot of other visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a loyal ally of this country, perpetually gets a bum rap from the media 
here, but its greatest asset as a tourist destination, especially for a woman 
who travels alone as I do, is that it is perfectly safe.

ON CITY HALL LAWN; 
</P>
<P>
COUNCILMAN'S IDEA TO HOUSE THE HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First, William H. Jennings, a Santa Monica city councilman, had a strange idea: 
Move the homeless to the front lawn of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Jennings has a strange ally: colorful activist Ted Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, who attracted considerable publicity last year by organizing a tent city 
on Venice beach, wants to put the homeless in igloo-like structures somewhere 
on public Santa Monica land, maybe even the front lawn of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Is anybody taking this seriously? Perhaps not yet, but the two men are not 
deterred. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes and Jennings met over lunch near Jennings' Century City law office last 
week. Hayes had heard about the Santa Monica councilman's proposal to clear the 
city's parks of homeless by moving them to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Getting Overrun' 
</P>
<P>
And Hayes, never shy when it comes to seizing an opportunity, told Jennings he 
could help. 
</P>
<P>
The way Jennings sees it, Santa Monica does a lot for the homeless: numerous 
feeding programs, some shelter, some health care. But, he believes, Santa 
Monica is in fact being punished for its generosity: The number of homeless 
roaming the city's streets and camping in the city's parks is growing 
dramatically, while few long-term solutions are being found. Jennings says 
parents, children and the elderly are increasingly afraid to use the parks. 
</P>
<P>
"We are really getting overrun here in Santa Monica, largely because we 
actually do care about homeless people," Jennings said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not leading to any solution, what we're doing. All we're doing is 
warehousing people," he said. "It doesn't move anybody out of . . . the 
homelessness syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
So his proposal, which he will present to fellow council members next month, is 
to begin steering the homeless back toward mainstream life. The first step is 
to move about 100 of them to tents and cots on City Hall's front lawn. 
</P>
<P>
His proposal also includes an order to police and city prosecutors to enforce a 
ban on overnight sleeping in the parks. That law and other minor nonviolent 
crimes such as public drunkenness and trespassing are rarely enforced when 
committed by the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Jennings believes the lawn, next to the Police Department and across Main 
Street from the RAND Corp., is an appropriate place because it will serve as a 
daily, constant reminder to government officials that it is their 
responsibility to do something about the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Big Statement' 
</P>
<P>
"It makes a statement, a big statement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jennings said the homeless should not be allowed to live on the lawn 
indefinitely. He sees the set-up as a "phase-one staging area" as the homeless 
begin to find jobs, places to live or organizations to take care of them. 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, meanwhile, offered to help organize the lawn community, set up security 
and screen the homeless who are taken there. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Hayes is proposing a pilot project with a handful of homeless who 
would be housed in curved, geodesic domes like the one he says he inhabits in 
South-Central Los Angeles. He is suggesting the domes, which house two people 
and measure about 14 feet by 9 feet, be set up temporarily on the lawn, then 
moved to other vacant sites in Santa Monica -- as well as other cities. 
</P>
<P>
"This should not be done for a long time, just long enough to show the nation 
that it can be done," Hayes said. "It's got to remain controllable. We don't 
want an urban campground." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes met with City Atty. Robert M. Myers on Thursday to discuss his idea, and 
he said he plans to seek support from other City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Take Up Too Much Space 
</P>
<P>
Jennings said he didn't think the domes would work at City Hall because they 
would take up too much space. Myers said he didn't foresee a legal problem with 
setting up domes on the lawn or on other city-owned land. 
</P>
<P>
"We need creative solutions to the homeless problem," Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, few people in City Hall seem to be taking Jennings' proposal seriously. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman David Finkel, who follows homeless issues, said Jennings may 
mean well, but trying to ban transients from the city's parks is neither 
enforceable, practical nor fair. And the front lawn of City Hall is not an 
appropriate site, he contends. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't just take a bunch of homeless people and stick them somewhere," 
Finkel said. "Any program has to be carefully thought out with social service 
providers. . . . It has to be screened, controlled, monitored. . . . I don't 
know whether he's given any thought to that." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Councilwoman Judy Abdo, also active in homeless issues, expressed 
certain skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the city has to have a response" to a growing homeless problem and 
growing community fears, Abdo said. "What that response will be, I don't know."

RAIN FOREST TEACHES CHILDREN LESSON IN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SPENCER S. HSU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Beverly Revness and Janice Tarr, the school year that ended Friday was a 
long, difficult and tumultuous one, but comments from students like 10-year-old 
Natasha Roje give them hope that it was not all in vain. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder, if I have children," Natasha told a classroom visitor recently, "if 
they'll ever get to know about the rain forests, or if they have to see 
pictures and stuff." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Small-Scale Triumph 
</P>
<P>
Revness and Tarr, teachers at Kenter Canyon Elementary School in Brentwood, 
have spent the year raising the environmental consciousness of their fourth- 
and fifth-graders with a joint project for the two classes. 
</P>
<P>
While many parents, teachers and students will remember the 1988-89 school year 
as the year of a teachers strike that highlighted the many troubles facing 
urban public education, others may prefer to find hope in the small-scale 
triumphs that take place in classrooms such as this one. 
</P>
<P>
Drawing from a range of public and private resources, Revness and Tarr 
assembled a year-long environmental awareness project for their classes which 
will be entered in a federal competition sponsored by the Environmental 
Protection Agency. The program, drawing hundreds of applicants a year, 
recognizes 10 precollegiate projects around the nation for outstanding service 
to the environment. Winning entrants are honored with a three-day trip to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the Kenter Canyon teachers fashioned a year-long curriculum centered 
on what scientists say is one of the most serious threats to the world's 
environment: the destruction of the globe's tropical rain forests. 
</P>
<P>
Back in September, most of the children would have been unable to even locate 
such forests on a map. Now, many show a remarkable grasp of some of the complex 
issues at stake. 
</P>
<P>
In one recent class, for example, they talked about how some American fast-food 
chains contribute to deforestation by obtaining their beef from cattle raised 
cheaply on cleared tropical land in South America and Indochina. At one point, 
some of the students announced that they would boycott the chains that did so. 
On other occasions, the students have written the heads of the International 
Monetary Fund and the U.S. Commerce and Agriculture departments to urge a halt 
to policies that encourage economic exploitation of such lands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Students Bused In 
</P>
<P>
The Kenter students, despite the school's location in affluent Brentwood, are 
relatively representative of the Los Angeles school district. About one-third 
of the 500 children are bused in from overcrowded inner-city areas. The student 
body is about two-thirds white, 21% Latino, 8% Asian-American and 7% black. 
Slightly more than one-sixth of the students have been designated to have 
limited English proficiency. 
</P>
<P>
Spoken to individually, the children in Revness and Tarr's classes are eager to 
explain what they have learned in lessons throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
"They're cutting down all the rain forest trees and they're burning them," says 
9-year-old Dana Horstein. Citing a makeshift textbook of environmentalist 
publications assembled by her teachers, she says rain forests are being 
destroyed in the tropics at the rate of 50 acres per minute. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists caution that at the current rate of use, such forests will be 
completely cut down by 2050, at devastating cost. Up to half the life forms on 
Earth live in the affected regions, including key sources for many drugs, such 
as those used to combat childhood leukemia. Scientists also caution that 
burning the trees amounts to a double-barreled contribution to global warming 
-- the so-called "greenhouse effect." Combustion adds pollutants and carbon 
dioxide to the atmosphere, while removal of trees decreases the planet's 
ability to absorb the gas, believed to be the key factor in trapping the sun's 
heat in the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Developers clear the forests for lumber, cattle-grazing land and commercial 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"By cutting down the trees it's going to make it hotter . . . and it'll be all 
gone and it'll be really hot," Dana adds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Making Pollution 
</P>
<P>
Rene Ramirez, 9, says: "I don't know, when they're cutting down the trees, if 
they're thinking." 
</P>
<P>
"I think they should . . . be more careful about it," adds Maiko Morishita, 10. 
"If they cut down the rain forest and burn it they're making pollution." 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm looking for when I'm teaching this course is to make these kids 
become trustees of the environment," says Revness, 60. A 25-year supporter of 
the Sierra Club and member of Greenpeace, the Audubon Society and World 
Wildlife Fund, Revness initiated the Kenter project and is a three-time 
recipient of a California teaching award for environmental awareness. 
</P>
<P>
"We have assumed an activist role. The children unfortunately do not have the 
money to join these organizations, but in spirit any time that they can work on 
(related projects) they do," says Revness. "You see, the first thing you have 
to do is motivate the children. And then it becomes a matter of education. . . 
. I just don't want them to grow up and feel 'This isn't happening around here 
and so this isn't happening (at all).' " 
</P>
<P>
The curriculum for the yearlong course drew from a wide variety of sources. 
Revness and Tarr, with the part-time assistance of June Carter, an 
undergraduate geography major at UCLA, used National Geographic videotapes in 
conjunction with several outings to the Los Angeles and San Diego Zoos to show 
children tropical wildlife, much of which faces extinction if deforestation 
patterns continue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Animal Habitats 
</P>
<P>
Later, zoo docents visited the classroom to lecture in more detail about animal 
habitats and food chains. 
</P>
<P>
Pamphlets from environmental groups such as the Rainforest Action Network or 
the World Wildlife Fund supplemented classroom materials depicting the tropical 
ecosystem, while the teachers adapted environmental themes for discussions and 
lessons ranging from social studies to art. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the yearlong project is a 4-by-6-foot scale model of an Amazonian 
rain forest created by the students. Using paint, Mylar, acetate, clay, 
Popsicle sticks, rubber bands and such, the students assembled a forest scene 
including a cattle pen, aboriginal inhabitants, loggers, road-builders and 
native animal species. 
</P>
<P>
"We did the animals," said Maiko and Natasha proudly. 
</P>
<P>
Carter took Revness's fifth-graders and Tarr's fourth-graders on field trips to 
collect pebbles and branches for the model, while helping them design the 
forest based on maps and textbooks. One student's retired grandfather helped by 
donating labor and craft work. 
</P>
<P>
"This is kind of unusual for fourth- and fifth-grade classes to do," says 
Kenter Principal Suzanne Westmoreland. "It went into an area of geography into 
depth. The children were really learning about the fragile balance of ecology." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Learn By Doing 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a 'learn-by-doing' project," says Revness, who says the students 
learned more by physically reconstructing what they had been taught. 
"(Environmentalism) doesn't exist in a vacuum." 
</P>
<P>
The model's designers like to talk about their work. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to show how dumb it is to put the cattle in the rain forest 
because the tigers and the lions just eat the cattle," says Philip Anson, 11. 
"You have to be aware" of the issues, says Philip. 
</P>
<P>
Others take a more reflective stance. Sometimes, "you just feel you can't do 
anything" when confronted with the scope of international actions, Natasha 
says. But her own formula for countering hopelessness reflects Revness' 
personal guideline. 
</P>
<P>
"What I look for in students is passion and commitment," says the teacher, who 
began her career concentrating on civics and U.S. law. 
</P>
<P>
For Natasha, the responsibility is clear. "You start thinking your vote can 
count, and then you make more letters and phone calls until you get more people 
to do something."

Take a few rotting sea walls and toss in the ocean's natural tendency to erode 
anything in its path. Add one state bureaucracy. Stir in 94 property owners, 
more than a dozen insurance companies and about 30 attorneys. Bring to a boil. 
</P>
<P>
The ingredients add up to a lot of confusion, a long-simmering legal battle 
and, for many of the Las Tunas Beach residents, an ill-tasting and costly 
settlement to replace the group of deteriorating sea barriers near their Malibu 
oceanfront homes. 
</P>
<P>
In two weeks, officials from the state of California and the Ticor Title 
Insurance Co. are scheduled to announce whether they will accept the proposed 
settlement, which would require the Las Tunas homeowners to pay for partial 
construction costs of new sea walls and assume liability for them for the next 
50 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
59 Agreed to Sign 
</P>
<P>
More than one-third of the homeowners, many of them furious over the conditions 
of the settlement, have so far declined to sign it, but only 51% of their 
signatures are needed to enforce it. So far, 59 have agreed to sign, apparently 
ensuring the deal will go forward. Last week, the state and Ticor extended the 
deadline to July 7 in an apparent attempt to get more homeowners to sign the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"I've felt from the very beginning that this was an awful agreement," said Lee 
Crowe, one of the so-called dissident property owners. "The homeowners have 
been led astray. Nobody has a grip on what this will mean for any of us." 
</P>
<P>
The steel-reinforced concrete barriers, called groins, were built 60 years ago 
at the eastern Malibu site to prevent further erosion of the beach. They were 
built by Title Insurance &amp; Trust Co., Ticor's forerunner, to protect the 
land it owned at the time. But after years of being concealed, the concrete 
walls broke away and the corrosive salt water ate away at the exposed metal, 
leaving behind a series of sharp, twisted spikes. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, the state of California filed a suit against 92 Las Tunas 
property owners and the insurer, seeking to force them to repair or remove the 
dangerous groins and assume all future liability for them. 
</P>
<P>
Since that time, more than two dozen lawyers representing the state, Ticor, the 
homeowners and their insurance companies have been haggling over a solution. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed settlement, a geologic hazard abatement district would be 
formed to replace the rotting groins with eight "rubble mound" barriers along 
the beach at an estimated cost of $3.05 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pitch In $400,000 
</P>
<P>
Ticor will put up $2.15 million, the homeowners' insurance companies will pitch 
in $400,000 and the rest will be assessed to the property owners, an estimated 
cost of $30,000 to $40,000 per parcel. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the homeowners' attorneys say they are opposed to the agreement 
because not enough study has been done to determine the exact cost of the 
project or to determine future maintenance costs. And many of the homeowners 
say that the new groins will have no effect on their beachfront properties, yet 
they are being forced to join in the settlement anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem for all of us is that a tremendous amount of this agreement has 
been left to speculation," said attorney Frank Hobbs, who represents one of the 
property owners. "You really don't know how much it's going to cost because 
there are no specifications for the groin systems. There is just so much that 
is completely unknown. There's not a lot of substance to this settlement." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Supports Settlement 
</P>
<P>
However, Craig Dummit, the attorney who represents about 62 of the 94 property 
owners and supports the settlement, said there is no way to come up with exact 
figures for a groin system. He said the cost of the project is known "as well 
as humanly possible." 
</P>
<P>
"It actually took a lot of creativity to get this agreement and frankly I was 
surprised that it was signed by as many people as it was," said Dummit, who 
said he wrote most of the 47-page settlement document. "But I guess I would 
have made a bad playwright. I've gotten a lot of bad reviews." 
</P>
<P>
Ticor attorney Don Franzen said the insurance company would not comment on the 
proposed settlement until the sign-up deadline passes. 
</P>
<P>
Those who sign the agreement must waive their right to sue Ticor over the groin 
dispute. Several homeowners opposed to the agreement have lawsuits pending 
against the insurance giant. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen groins, ranging from 80 to 455 feet long, were erected in 1929 at Las 
Tunas Beach in eastern Malibu. Five of the groins stand in Las Tunas State 
Beach, which is little more than a dirt parking lot fronting the Pacific Ocean. 
Under the agreement, the state will assume liability for those groins, while 
the homeowners will be liable for the replacement and maintenance of the other 
eight. The state will not be required to pay any money under the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Houses Could Be Threatened 
</P>
<P>
State attorneys have long maintained that the homeowners and Ticor should 
either remove the groins or repair them. Property owners in the area claim that 
the state threatened to pull the groins out if they were not repaired, even 
though many experts believe that houses and portions of the beach could be 
washed away if the groins were removed. 
</P>
<P>
Several homeowners are upset over the agreement because they believe that they 
could be forced to pay thousands of dollars in future assessments to maintain 
the groins. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem is that it is a complete unknown how much the homeowners 
would have to pay," attorney Jeanne Flaherty said. "There are just too many 
ifs, ands and buts in this agreement. It's ambiguous and it is unfair." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed settlement will be negated if the assessment district is unable to 
find an insurance carrier, and several attorneys say that finding an insurance 
carrier could be a problem considering the potential hazard created by the 
groins. 
</P>
<P>
There have been two lawsuits involving joggers during the past 10 years. In 
each incident, the runners claimed that they impaled a foot on a hidden spike. 
The suits were settled out of court for about $30,000 each.

PLAYA VISTA PLAN CALLS FOR A MIX; 
</P>
<P>
HOMES WITH OFFICES ON NEARBY LOTS

<P>
Playa Vista, the massive residential and commercial project proposed for south 
of Marina del Rey, is shaping into neighborhoods with a mix of mid-rise office 
buildings and low-rise residential complexes. 
</P>
<P>
At public meetings on Thursday and Friday, Nelson C. Rising, who heads the 
development team for Maguire Thomas Partners, unveiled preliminary drawings 
that showed three- and four-story residential courtyard complexes down the 
street from five- and six-story office buildings in a campus-like setting. 
</P>
<P>
Rising said he does not expect any residential complex to be taller than six 
stories, or any commercial office building to be taller than 10 stories, which 
is below the ridgeline of the nearby Westchester bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
Besides providing some early glimpses of the development's overall 
architectural look, the latest plans show several significant changes from 
earlier versions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Open Space 
</P>
<P>
About 2,300 residential units and 70,000 square feet of retail business space 
that had been planned for the southwest corner of Lincoln and Jefferson 
boulevards have been relocated. Those 47 acres will remain open, although an 
interpretive nature center may be built. 
</P>
<P>
The elimination of development on this site is contingent on settlement of a 
lawsuit filed against the developers by Friends of Ballona Wetlands, a 
preservation group. 
</P>
<P>
The previous developer had agreed to set aside 175 acres of wetlands and 41 
acres of sand dunes, and had pledged $10 million to the National Audubon 
Society to restore and maintain the wetlands. These provisions have been 
incorporated by Maguire Thomas Partners. 
</P>
<P>
A six-story senior citizen housing complex that had been planned for the far 
west corner of the parcel is being replaced with a one- or two-story recreation 
center that will be accessible only by foot, bicycle or shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
The number of streets will be increased in the southeastern part of the 
957-acre tract, where most of the development will be concentrated. Rising said 
this will allow for a mix of shops, homes, offices and parks rather than 
clustering each use in separate areas that are accessible only by car. 
</P>
<P>
In some neighborhoods, people will live above street-level retail and office 
space. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the developers plan to build 11,100 residential units, about 5 million 
square feet of office space and about 680,000 square feet of retail space. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to create neighborhoods where everyone is within six minutes' 
walking distance of town centers," Rising said. "People will not need their 
cars to get from one place to another." 
</P>
<P>
In effect, said principal architect Andres Duany of Miami, the developers will 
attempt to build a new city by borrowing many of the elements of small towns 
before 1940. Ideally, many residents will be able to work and shop within 
walking distance of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all the housing will be in multifamily complexes of apartments, 
condominiums and townhouses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Residents Consulted 
</P>
<P>
Since becoming the lead developer for the project in February, Maguire Thomas 
has engaged in extensive consultations with residents in communities 
surrounding the project. The revised plans announced last week -- showing a 
significant increase in the number of residential units coupled with cuts in 
the amount of commercial space -- were a product of those meetings. 
</P>
<P>
New plans for the northwest quadrant of the parcel -- which was to include a 
40-acre marina with up to 900 boat slips, 1,800 hotel rooms, 1,226 residential 
units and 150,000 square feet of retail space -- will be discussed in late July 
or early August after an environmental study is completed, Rising said. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the team of architects, designers and planners met at the Playa 
Vista center on the corner of Lincoln and Jefferson boulevards. As late as 
Thursday morning, designers were still sketching on yellow tracing paper, 
traffic consultants were eliminating some proposals as unworkable, and 
architects were moving around blocks representing buildings to see where they 
fit best. 
</P>
<P>
Renderings were still being colored in for Thursday night's presentation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a lot further along than I thought we would be, but we're still a long 
way from a finished plan," Rising said. 
</P>
<P>
The changes represent a victory for residents living near the project and for 
Los Angeles Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who defeated former Councilwoman Pat 
Russell in 1987. Russell's support for the project as envisioned then was 
widely viewed as a major cause of her ouster. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vow to Reduce Scale 
</P>
<P>
In her campaign, Galanter said she would fight to have the project scaled back, 
even though it had already been approved in 1986 by the city and the state 
Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Last August, Galanter called for a new environmental impact report, the 
preservation of a larger portion of wetlands and a 40% reduction in the amount 
of office space. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Galanter said she would not evaluate the project until all the 
proposed changes are made. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas, whose other projects include the 73-story First Interstate 
World Center under construction in downtown Los Angeles, bought into Playa 
Vista in February for an undisclosed sum and took over as managing partner. 
Howard Hughes Properties Inc., a subsidiary of Summa Corp., remains as a 
limited partner. JMB Realty Corp., which owns and built much of Century City, 
also purchased an interest in the project. 
</P>
<P>
Maguire Thomas' core group of consultants is being directed by the architect 
Duany and his partner, Elizabeth Plater-Zybeck, and by the Santa Monica-based 
firm of Moore, Ruble, Yudell.

POLICE SAY HAND-HELD DEVICE IS JUST THE TICKET FOR PARKING VIOLATIONS 
</P>

MONTEREY PARK

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As she cruised by the Hong Kong Super Market, Officer Judy Lesinsky spotted a 
seafood delivery truck that blocked not just one, but two handicapped parking 
spaces. 
</P>
<P>
"That's definitely a violation," Lesinsky said. As she stepped from her 
vehicle, she carried not the traditional ticket pad, but a hand-held computer. 
</P>
<P>
Lesinsky punched a series of fingertip-sized keys, answering programmed 
questions. The computer automatically recorded the time and date on its 
two-line display screen. From a menu of items, she picked the appropriate 
violation. The fine, $103, automatically appeared. 
</P>
<P>
After editing the ticket, Lesinsky pushed a button and the computer's tiny 
printer spit out a slender, yellow citation. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Monterey Park joined 19 other police agencies around the country 
which use a computer known as Auto/CITE, manufactured and marketed by 
Enforcement Technology Inc. of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen of the 20 agencies using the device are in California -- in 
Paramount, West Hollywood, Laguna Beach, Monterey, Walnut Creek and other 
cities. Long Beach will begin using dhe computers next week and San Diego, next 
month, said Enforcement Technology President Gary Ward, a former police 
sergeant in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
The company sells and leases the computers and equipment required for the 
ticketing system. It also handles the processing of tickets and follow-up 
notices for negligent violators, works with the court system and collects fines 
for the city. 
</P>
<P>
It also provides statistical analyses of the types of violations and where they 
occur. 
</P>
<P>
"The computer is much more efficient, probably by 30% just in doing the job of 
writing tickets," Monterey Park Police Capt. Joseph Santoro said. 
</P>
<P>
The device allows an officer to speed through a list of 50 possible violations. 
The first that automatically appear are those that occur most often in Monterey 
Park. The computer's memory lists 250 street names in the city and it can be 
preset when an officer is working a certain street, so the street name is 
automatically printed when the officer hits a single key. 
</P>
<P>
"And it absolutely eliminates the paper flow," Santoro said. The only paper is 
the ticket left on a violator's windshield. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of each shift, officers connect the computers to a device that 
transfers the ticket information to a personal computer at police headquarters. 
The data are then transmitted to Enforcement Technology. 
</P>
<P>
The two-pound portable computer has other advantages that police like. Each 
unit can hold information on as many as 5,000 license plates. It was a parking 
ticket that led police to the "Son of Sam" murderer in New York City in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
At its most basic, the device can help track habitual offenders and ticket 
scofflaws. Monterey Park police use the computer to identify vehicles that have 
five or more outstanding tickets, and thus can be legally towed. 
</P>
<P>
Police records supervisor Mary Ream, who saw the device at a conference, 
suggested using it as a cost-saving measure. The system, Santoro said, frees 
two records clerks. But how much money it saves is uncertain. Enforcement 
Technology charges the city $1.05 for each ticket, including any follow-up. 
Last year the department issued 21,000 tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Changes in city parking rules make it difficult to judge the success of the 
ticketing program, Santoro said. The city has recently expanded by 75% the 
number of streets included under a ban on parking when the streets are swept. 
</P>
<P>
One advantage of the system is certain: its accuracy. With its date and time 
function, "when the ticket says it was 7:30, it was 7:30," said traffic bureau 
Sgt. George L. Hicks. "That eliminates the violator who says 'My car wasn't 
there at 7:30 in the morning.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eliminates Confusion 
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, the computer prints in an easy-to-read type that may eliminate 
confusion for those who have difficulty reading English. So far, Hicks said, 
"no one has complained about the use of the computer ticketing." 
</P>
<P>
And, Santoro said, "if somebody says they want to fight a ticket in court, they 
still have the same rights as before." 
</P>
<P>
As Lesinsky finished printing the ticket at the Hong Kong Super Market, the 
truck driver demanded to know why he was getting a ticket. Lesinsky explained, 
and then handed him the $103 citation. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody's yelling and screaming, that's when we make the most errors," she 
said as the man drove away. "But you can still print out the perfect citation 
with this."

CRITICS SAY THEY'RE IN DARK ABOUT SUPERFUND PROCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past six years, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has paid 
almost $280,000 to two contractors to provide community relations for its 
Superfund program to clean up polluted San Gabriel Valley ground water. 
</P>
<P>
But the community relations plan for the program is not finished, project 
documents that are supposed to be available in local libraries are not in 
place, and one environmentalist who tried to get some information on the 
project from the EPA said he was told that he would have to file a request 
under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
Wil Baca, an engineer who has headed environmental committees of the Hacienda 
Heights Improvement Assn. and is on the Board of Directors of the Santa 
Monica-based Coalition for Clean Air, said the community relations effort has 
been invisible to the public. Far from involving the community in the 
ground-water project, Baca said, the EPA has made it difficult for residents to 
find out what it is doing. 
</P>
<P>
"The public has been shut out of the Superfund process," Baca said. "They want 
to keep us dumb." 
</P>
<P>
The EPA has a $402,250 contract with the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal 
Water District for community relations and technical assistance. 
</P>
<P>
In his quarterly reports to the EPA documenting his district's work on 
community relations, Robert Berlien, the district's general manager, lists 
attendance at community meetings, review of EPA documents, conferences with 
politicians, meetings with EPA officials and interviews with the news media. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of March of this year, the district had received and spent $246,973 
under the cooperative agreement. Of that amount, about $63,000 went to an 
engineering firm to provide EPA with technical assistance, and the remaining 
$184,000 was spent on community relations. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've served a purpose in at least giving people a place to get their 
questions (about the Superfund project) answered, in keeping some contact with 
local government agencies about what's going on," Berlien said. "I think we've 
served a good purpose in reviewing EPA plans." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its $402,250 contract with the district, EPA has budgeted 
$207,000 for community relations work by CH2M Hill, its major consultant on the 
San Gabriel Valley project. 
</P>
<P>
The community relations plan is being prepared by CH2M Hill. The staff member 
who wrote the latest version declined to comment on it, citing her company's 
policy of referring all matters about work for EPA to that agency. An EPA 
spokesman said the community relations plan is being reviewed and should be 
ready for adoption in July. 
</P>
<P>
David Jones, remedial branch chief of the EPA Western region, said CH2M Hill 
has been paid $95,000 of the $207,000 budgeted for it to develop and implement 
the plan. Jones stressed that community relations work, such as preparation and 
distribution of fact sheets, has been done without waiting for the plan to be 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA and the state Department of Health Services hired CH2M Hill in 1983 to 
write a plan dividing community relations tasks between the federal and state 
agencies. That plan, completed in May, 1984, was outdated nine months later 
when the state drastically reduced its role in the cleanup. But Neil Ziemba, 
EPA manager of the San Gabriel Valley project, said the plan was still useful 
because it outlined the tasks to be performed. 
</P>
<P>
Amy Schwartz, EPA community relations coordinator, said work on revision of the 
plan began in 1986 but was not completed until this year because other projects 
had higher priority. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government has spent more than $8.5 million on the San Gabriel 
Valley ground water project, mostly for studies and engineering reports 
characterizing the extent of the pollution and analyzing ways to treat 
contaminated water. 
</P>
<P>
Because the San Gabriel Valley project is run from the EPA Western regional 
office in San Francisco, the only local access to EPA studies and reports is 
through files maintained at libraries and water district offices. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA sends information on the San Gabriel Valley project to eight libraries, 
but ships complete files to only two -- in La Puente and Baldwin Park -- and to 
a water resources center at UCLA and to the El Monte office of the Upper San 
Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District. 
</P>
<P>
Baca said that, on a recent visit to La Puente library, he found only a few 
documents available. The Baldwin Park library's file also is incomplete. For 
example, it is missing three of the six fact sheets that the EPA has issued. 
</P>
<P>
The documents include maps of polluted areas, reports on contaminated wells and 
proposals for water treatment projects. 
</P>
<P>
Baca said that he called Ziemba to request that libraries be restocked with 
documents, but was told that the agency is reluctant to do so because libraries 
just throw the material away. Baca said that he then asked for documents to be 
sent to him personally, but was told that he must file a request under the 
Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
Ziemba said that, although there has been a problem with libraries discarding 
the documents sent to them, EPA plans to restock library files by the end of 
July. He said he had asked Baca to file a Freedom of Information request 
because the EPA cannot supply its documents free to everyone in the San Gabriel 
Valley who might want them, but he wanted to establish a basis for giving them 
to Baca in his capacity as a representative of community groups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Requests Rebuffed 
</P>
<P>
Baca said he has tried to find out how the EPA is pursuing companies that are 
responsible for leaking contaminants into ground water, but he has been 
rebuffed on grounds that disclosure could harm the government's legal case. The 
EPA's position, he said, makes it impossible for the public to judge the 
agency's performance. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Baca said, the agency has never disclosed an overall plan for 
cleaning up ground water in the San Gabriel Valley. It has invited public 
comments only on scattered projects. The result, he said, has been to avoid 
public scrutiny of the agency's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
Ziemba said EPA is preparing a document that will outline proposed priorities 
for cleanup projects and will seek public comments on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
EPA spokesman Terry Wilson denied that the EPA is discouraging public 
participation. In fact, he said, the agency offers $50,000 grants to help 
community groups obtain technical assistance to study Superfund projects, 
although no one has yet applied for a grant to study the San Gabriel Valley 
ground water problem. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA originally planned to organize a committee of residents, called a 
community work group, to monitor the ground water cleanup effort. But the 
revised community relations plan says that formation of such a group is being 
abandoned for lack of interest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Citizens Group 
</P>
<P>
However, without any funding from EPA, the League of Women Voters recently 
organized a committee, called the Superfund Working/Information Group, to 
monitor the cleanup project. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Johnson, who used a $2,500 grant from the League of Women Voters Education 
Fund to form SWIG, said she began by contacting community organizations that 
might be interested in learning more about the water problem. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing we did," she said, "was get on the telephone. We just called the 
heads of organizations and from that, we were really surprised at the results 
we got." She said the group's informational meetings attracted up to 70 people 
and that about 30 people have indicated interest in meeting regularly to 
monitor the water project. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Baca, Johnson said she has found the EPA staff interested in drawing the 
community into the Superfund process. "The staff of EPA is terrific," she said. 
"They are very happy to do anything we need." 
</P>
<P>
But, she said, she sees little difference between the community work group, 
which EPA's proposed community relation plan says cannot be organized, and 
SWIG, which she and other residents have formed on their own. 
</P>
<P>
Ziemba noted that public interest in the ground-water problem has risen and 
fallen several times. When the EPA signed a cooperative agreement with the 
Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District in 1985 to provide community 
relations and technical assistance, he said, the district was going to play a 
much bigger role than it is playing now. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
District's Early Efforts 
</P>
<P>
The district initially hired a full-time community relations officer to perform 
work under the EPA contract. But the employee quit after six months to take 
another job and was not replaced. Berlien said the community relations effort 
was scaled back after it became clear that "there weren't any citizens groups 
or community people that were particularly interested in what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
Berlien said there was a flurry of interest in ground-water contamination at 
the end of 1979 and in early 1980, when it was first disclosed that dozens of 
San Gabriel Valley wells were contaminated with suspected cancer-causing 
chemicals, such as trichloroethylene (TCE) and perchloroethylene (PCE). There 
was another burst of interest in 1985, he said, when the state Department of 
Health Services notified 5,300 homes and businesses in Hacienda Heights that 
their water was unfit to drink. The state withdrew the notice a few days later 
after reassessing the health hazard. 
</P>
<P>
But Berlien said it has been difficult to sustain public interest in 
ground-water pollution because the contamination is scattered over a wide area, 
and water suppliers have managed to meet state and federal drinking water 
standards by drilling new wells and making other adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
"People have always been told that their water is safe to drink," Berlien said. 
"And that kind of confuses people, because they don't know whether they have a 
problem or not." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Berlien said, the Superfund project is moving so slowly that it 
seems pointless to hold community meetings when there is seldom anything new to 
report. The EPA has estimated that it will take decades to bring the 
contamination under control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Final Plan 
</P>
<P>
Under its cooperative agreement with the EPA, the water district is supposed to 
help implement the community relations plan. Lacking a final plan, Berlien 
said, his office has simply been doing what it thinks "needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Berlien said he received the latest version of the community relations plan in 
February along with a note from CH2M Hill that said: "We're planning to 
incorporate final changes, print up and bind copies and send them out to the 
repositories in the next two weeks or so." 
</P>
<P>
Berlien said: "I haven't heard anything about it since then. What's happened to 
it, I just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Berlien said the cooperative agreement originally was for 18 months, but it has 
been extended without changing the spending ceiling of $402,205. 
</P>
<P>
Although the water district is a contractor with EPA, it also has been a strong 
critic of the cleanup effort. 
</P>
<P>
At a congressional subcommittee hearing on the ground-water project conducted 
by U.S. Rep. Esteban Torres (D-La Puente) June 5 in Baldwin Park, Berlien 
complained that the EPA has failed to develop a comprehensive plan and that 
"water suppliers do not have a clear idea of where the cleanup project is 
headed." He urged the EPA to provide more funding, hire more staff and open a 
local office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Community Interest 
</P>
<P>
The congressional hearing attracted 250 people, including representatives of 
the East Valleys Organization, a church-based group that has declared its 
intention to raise community concern about ground water to speed the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
Berlien said the creation of SWIG and the declaration by the East Valleys 
Organization are the first evidence of strong community concern about ground 
water since the brief surge of interest during the Hacienda Heights 
contamination scare in 1985. But whether that interest will be sustained, he 
said, remains to be seen, given the slow pace of the cleanup project. 
</P>
<P>
The latest version of the community relations plan is based on community 
interviews conducted three to six years ago. But even then there was impatience 
with the rate of progress. The plan notes that "several people, including 
elected officials, have stated their frustration with the length of time it is 
taking to perform studies and take action to clean up the contamination."

RECRUITING GAYS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reason so few showed for the first gay recruiting seminar for law 
enforcement officers in Southern California (Times, June 15) is because not 
only did the event receive scant publicity, but also the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department blocked any positive outreach to gay men and women. 
</P>
<P>
Despite my personally reminding Sheriff Sherman Block and West Hollywood City 
Manager Paul Brotzman that the timing and advertising of this historic event 
was crucial to its success, Sheriff Block just said no to any advertising aimed 
specifically at the gay community by forbidding paid publicity in the gay press 
and by purposefully scheduling his own Westside recruit seminar and exam well 
before 250,000 gay men and women annually gather in West Hollywood for the Gay 
and Lesbian Pride Celebration. 
</P>
<P>
As I pointed out to Block and Brotzman, it would be most effective to hold the 
recruiting seminar and exam after advertising to 250,000 gay people gathered 
for the Christopher Street West parade and festival Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
After being reminded again as far back as April as to the impact of billboards 
and flyers during Gay Pride Weekend, the Sheriff's Department squelched 
advertising and hurriedly scheduled its first Westside exam June 17, a week 
before Gay Pride. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, it's not enough for Block to say the department does not 
discriminate against any group and welcomes "any and all qualified candidates." 
Truly representative community-based law enforcement in West Hollywood, where 
35% of the 37,000 residents are gay, requires the Sheriff's Department to reach 
out and forthrightly assure gays who have been traditionally shunned by the 
department that if they step forward their safety will be protected. It's quite 
a lot to expect an openly gay person to put his or her life on the line and to 
rely upon other officers to back them up in life-threatening situations when 
the perception exits among gays that they are not really welcome in law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, as to the sexual orientation questions asked on the standard 
psychological exam given all applicants, the test has been changed as a result 
of longstanding protests by the gay community. The old Minnesota Multiphasic 
Personality Inventory (MMPI) test used to screen for homosexuality as a 
pathology has been revised to exclude sexist and homophobic questions. 
Unfortunately the new test, renamed MMPI-2, will not be ready until Aug. 1. 
Again, another reason to delay holding a Westside recruiting seminar and exam 
until all the pieces of the puzzle are in their proper place. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the city of West Hollywood has taken an important first step and 
in the words of Mayor Abbe Land: "If more (gays) don't apply this time around, 
maybe they will in the future. This was at least a start." 
</P>
<P>
Next time maybe the Sheriff's Department will cooperate with both the city and 
its gay community.

MENTAL HEALTH CENTER MAY BE FORCED TO CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
ARCADIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Facing a new deadline to close by August, the Arcadia Mental Health Center is 
working with a reduced staff and has trimmed its caseload from a high of 2,000 
several years ago to about 60 now, the center's director said. 
</P>
<P>
The center continues to offer its 24-hour mobile Psychiatric Emergency Team, 
which assists law enforcement agencies by evaluating and transporting mentally 
ill people, but now staffs it with three counselors instead of five, director 
John Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing the best we can to respond to their emergencies," Wells said. The 
330 E. Live Oak Ave. center serves a San Gabriel Valley district stretching 
from Altadena to San Dimas and from Monterey Park to Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the February announcement that the center might close, Wells said, 
several patients became despondent and at least six have attempted suicide. 
"They felt they are losing their support system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Continuing Reduction 
</P>
<P>
No specific date has been set for the closing, part of a continuing reduction 
in mental health services as Los Angeles County struggles with budget cutbacks. 
On June 9, three county mental health centers -- East San Fernando Valley in 
North Hollywood, Coastal Community in Carson and a Wilmington center -- closed 
after mental health advocacy groups lost a court battle to prevent the 
closings. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said $15 million is needed to keep the remaining 25 clinics 
open, but they expect to receive only $5.4 million from the state. The Arcadia 
center and four others, among eight originally targeted for closing, received a 
reprieve after the County Board of Supervisors approved additional funding in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
Through resignations, retirements or transfers, the center's staff of 30 has 
decreased to 23, plus one part-time employee, Wells said. Of the 23, 11 are 
professionals: Wells, another psychiatrist and nine social workers, nurses and 
technicians. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 625 patients the center was treating in February have been 
transferred to five private clinics that have contracts with the county: 
Pacific Clinic East in Duarte, Pacific Clinic in Pasadena, La Puente Valley 
Community Mental Health Center, Mid-Valley Community Mental Health Council in 
Baldwin Park and the Foothill Community Mental Health Center in Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Longer Waiting List 
</P>
<P>
Doug Parker, associate director of the Mid-Valley Council, which received 50 
patients from Arcadia, said the increase at his clinic has resulted in slightly 
longer waiting lists for appointments. "The transition is a little frustrating 
for them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
There is no waiting list at the La Puente center, a 10-month-old facility that 
agreed to accept 200 patients from Arcadia and has seen about half, said 
director Rose Massa. La Puente staff members have tried to contact referrals by 
mail or telephone, Massa said. The center also added El Monte and South El 
Monte to the 16 cities in its service area. 
</P>
<P>
For the Arcadia center, however, the stress has hurt staff morale, Wells said. 
"This is our fifth straight year of being put on the block for closure soon."

ROBIN BRENNER DIGS DEEP; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S A DIRTY JOB; SHE SAYS SHE LOVES IT: SEARCHING FOR RED ANTS FOR UNCLE 
MILTIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The red ants, they live in fields of sandy earth, in tunnels that lead every 
which way. The woman, she drives by and sees a field. She stops and takes her 
shovel to dig at the red ants. 
</P>
<P>
Intricate patterns of tunnels lie just beneath the surface. Sometimes she finds 
small pockets, places where the ants have stored seed and other food. 
</P>
<P>
"They even have graveyards underground," the woman says. "You'll hit one place, 
and they'll all be dead." 
</P>
<P>
When she finds places where the ants are alive, when she reaches to gather 
them, they bite. They leave sores that swell and itch. 
</P>
<P>
The woman has learned these things over many years because her father made her 
dig for ants when she was very young, taught her how to do it. Thirty years 
later, she is still digging for ants. 
</P>
<P>
Millions of children across America, like so many ants scattered about, have 
never heard of Robin Brenner, but they're happier because she keeps digging. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Industrious Diggers 
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old woman gathers pogonomyrmex Californicus, a most industrious 
worker that is perfectly suited to live in those clear-plastic toys known as 
Uncle Milton Ant Farms. Pogis, they are called, will toil in daylight, digging 
as children watch on. 
</P>
<P>
Brenner is equally suited to her task of unearthing these insects. After many 
years, she can dig for them better than her father ever could. 
</P>
<P>
A thin woman of blond hair and few words, she scours fields near Palmdale, 
Lancaster and San Bernardino, sometimes as far south as San Diego. She looks 
for small openings in the ground, tiny ants scurrying about. She sets to work 
like her late father, Kenneth Gidney, did. 
</P>
<P>
Gidney started digging ants in 1959 after answering an Uncle Milton ad in the 
Los Angeles Times. He learned by trial and error, learned to slice through the 
dirt layer by layer, following the tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a hillbilly from Tennessee, and he knew the ground," said "Uncle" 
Milton Levine, who invented the ant farm and has sold almost 10 million of the 
$8.99 toys in 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
Gidney taught his offspring early on. 
</P>
<P>
"We had 10 children and everybody did it," Brenner recalls. "We picked them 
into coffee cans with our hands. You'd get bit. It hurt." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vacuuming Ants 
</P>
<P>
Brenner -- who took a decade off from ant collecting after she was married -- 
is the only sibling who has carried on the tradition. But she doesn't make her 
three children do it, and she has added technology to the process. She fixed a 
car vacuum to a plastic bowl and now, after she digs up tunnels of the red 
ants, she vacuums them up. 
</P>
<P>
In 10 hours' work, Brenner can collect 50,000 ants. Queen ants -- larger, 
darker and winged -- must be avoided. If they are included in the batch, the 
others won't dig. Brenner loads her bounty into a blue Blazer and drives them 
home to Phelan in San Bernardino County 
</P>
<P>
Back at the house, the work is simpler. 
</P>
<P>
The ants and dirt are poured onto large plates. For some reason of insect 
logic, the ants emerge from the dirt to crawl off the plates and Brenner puts 
them into large cans with a few drops of water to keep them alive. 
</P>
<P>
During an average week, Brenner will collect and store some 200,000 ants. On 
Fridays and Saturdays, Brenner and a half-dozen hired workers put the ants, 
one-by-one, into vials. Thirty ants to a vial. No more, no less. 
</P>
<P>
"Sitting there hour after hour, counting ants . . . it's tedious," she says. 
Brenner must constantly hire new workers because "they get bored counting the 
ants." 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes when I'm sitting up late at night, I think 'People don't know how 
hard this is. They don't know where these ants come from. They don't know how 
much sleep I'm missing." 
</P>
<P>
The ants will live 10 days, 15 at most, in a vial. So each Sunday, Brenner 
delivers as many as 6,000 vials to Uncle Milton headquarters in Culver City. 
The vials are promptly sent to any kid with an Uncle Milton Ant Farm and the 
redeemable coupon that comes with it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
15 Million Ants 
</P>
<P>
Levine said his company sends out 500,000 vials a year. That is 15 million 
ants' worth. 
</P>
<P>
Two other people besides Brenner provide the insects, but Brenner remains, like 
her father, the prized ant collector around Uncle Milton Industries. She earns 
35 cents a vial -- about a penny an ant -- and has paid for horses, a stable 
and a back yard riding arena with the profits. 
</P>
<P>
"She does great," Levine said. "She did it since she was a kid and she knows 
the business." 
</P>
<P>
Patience, she said, is the key. So she keeps at it. 
</P>
<P>
During summer, when the ground is dry and the ants stray from their tunnels, 
she splits her time between collecting and reconnaissance, finding prime ant 
hills and marking them with white stakes. 
</P>
<P>
During winter, when ants stay home and the earth is soft for digging, she 
returns to reap what she has sown. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a never-ending process," she said. 
</P>
<P>
True, there isn't much chance the supply will run dry. 
</P>
<P>
As Levine put it: "There's a whole lot more ants out there. They'll never die. 
I don't think even an atomic bomb would put them to sleep."

FUNGIPHILE STALKS WILD MUSHROOM FOR FUN, PROFIT -- AND GOOD TASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mohamad Ismail is frankly fond of fungi. The 35-year-old Playa del Rey man 
collects them for fun and profit. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail, who owns Pacific Exotic Mushrooms in Van Nuys, is one of a handful of 
Southern Californians who supply local restaurants and produce companies with 
wild mushrooms. The demand, he said, is considerable. "Every major Westside 
restaurant that has a menu item over $10 wants chanterelles, morels or porcini 
mushrooms." 
</P>
<P>
Ismail, who has been gathering commercially since 1982, has sold to La Toque, 
Spago, Michael's and other well-known restaurants in Los Angeles and Santa 
Barbara. He also dries and sells wild mushrooms under his own label. 
</P>
<P>
A fungiphile before he was a myco-merchant, Ismail first hunted local mushrooms 
for the sheer pleasure of finding something scrumptious growing in the wild. He 
started out during his undergraduate days at UCLA, gathering chanterelles, 
yellow mushrooms that smell like apricots and thrive in the local mountains 
during wet winter months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Amazing Variety 
</P>
<P>
"My goal at that point was to go out and find something to eat once or twice a 
week," Ismail said. He recalls leafing through the hefty Audubon Field Guide to 
North American Mushrooms and thinking, "My God, there can't be this many 
mushrooms." Since then, he has verified the existence of hundreds of species. 
</P>
<P>
Most fungi thrive on moisture, Ismail said, and Southern California is usually 
too dry to be prime mushroom territory. "We don't have that many good years," 
he said, "and we haven't had a good year since 1984-85." 
</P>
<P>
Wild mushrooms are also seasonal. The morels, as sure a harbinger of spring as 
income taxes, have already disappeared from the San Bernardino Mountains and 
the Sierra Nevada. But Ismail recently harvested 50 pounds of giant puffball 
mushrooms in the San Bernardinos, leaving all but the choicest specimens 
unpicked. "I left behind 100 pounds, easy. They were past their prime, and I 
couldn't sell them." Slices of puffball, Ismail pointed out, are terrific on 
pizza. 
</P>
<P>
To keep his clients in wild mushrooms during the local off-season, Ismail 
usually goes to the Pacific Northwest each year between August and October. In 
Washington and Oregon, mushrooms thrive in the moist forests like, well, 
mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
While in the Northwest, Ismail presents slide shows, training others to 
identify commercially valuable mushrooms and giving pointers on how to find 
them. Morels, for instance, flourish on ground that has been burned over. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Ismail said, "I know there are going to be hundreds of pickers 
converging on Yellowstone." (People who gather mushrooms commercially almost 
always need a permit to pick on public land. Non-pros should also check on the 
conditions under which they can gather.) 
</P>
<P>
Ismail earned a master's degree studying mycology -- the science of fungi -- at 
the University of New Brunswick in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only in Wild 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the white buttons in the supermarket, some of the most popular wild 
mushrooms, including chanterelles, morels and porcini mushrooms, cannot be 
cultivated, Ismail said. As a result, chanterelles may sell for as much as $18 
a pound, morels for even more. 
</P>
<P>
To stalk the wild mushroom, Ismail wears a simple uniform -- jeans, hiking 
boots and "my mushroom shirt," a black sweat shirt with long sleeves to protect 
his arms from brambles and nature's other scratchers and stingers. 
</P>
<P>
He uses a hunting knife to harvest the mushrooms and carries his treasure home 
in five-gallon plastic buckets. Ismail is not as proprietary about his choice 
hunting grounds as some of his colleagues, who place sentries with 
walkie-talkies around their secret places. But he does not hand out maps 
either. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail loves being in the wild on these expeditions. "Sometimes it's almost a 
religious experience out there," he said. "Once you get hooked on mushrooms, 
you can't get them out of your system." Mushrooms are extraordinary in their 
variety, he noted. Some look like undersea corals, some like floor mats. Some 
smell like pine, others like shrimp and maple syrup. They are every imaginable 
color, including bright purple -- and some exude a blood-red liquid when 
bruised. There are as many flavors as there are varieties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Losing Directions 
</P>
<P>
Like other wilderness activities, mushroom hunting has its perils. "I never get 
lost in the woods, but sometimes I get turned around," Ismail said. He once 
became disoriented in an early snowfall while looking for American matsutake 
mushrooms in the Siskiyou Mountains, near the California-Oregon border. 
</P>
<P>
He wandered in the snow for an hour or two until the sun suddenly came out and 
revealed the path below. "It took me two hours to get up that ridge. I was down 
in 10 minutes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He has heard wild boar while mushroom hunting, but the only injury he has 
suffered was a severe sting after he dropped his knife into a bee hive. 
</P>
<P>
Ismail, who is vice president of the Los Angeles Mycological Society, says wild 
mushrooms are far less dangerous than most people believe. Only a small 
percentage are poisonous, he said, and those are readily identifiable. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference between the deadly ones and the edible ones is the difference 
between apples and oranges," he said. "I've eaten over 100 varieties of 
mushrooms, and I've never been poisoned. I've never come close to being 
poisoned." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caution on Gathering 
</P>
<P>
However, no one should gather wild mushrooms until he or she learns to identify 
them positively, he cautioned. And he recommends cooking all wild mushrooms 
before eating them. 
</P>
<P>
Gathering mushrooms, Ismail said, "isn't getting me rich but it's paying my 
rent." He would like to expand the business, perhaps becoming a grower of 
mushrooms as well as a forager. "Some varieties aren't being cultivated but 
could be." 
</P>
<P>
As a consumer, Ismail is hard-pressed to name his favorite among the wild 
mushrooms. He likes matsutake, hedgehog, cauliflower, horn of plenty. . . . As 
to his favorite recipe, it couldn't be simpler. "I'm a purist," he said. "I 
like them sauteed in butter, with salt and pepper and a little garlic."

EMIGRE REUNITED WITH REFUSENIK HUSBAND

Lucy Pokryshevsky stood waiting at the gate in Los Angeles International 
Airport surrounded by preschool children from her Rancho Park synagogue who 
sang and waved American flags. She had waited a long time for this day. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve years later than she expected and 13 after she left her home in the 
Soviet Union, the 60-year-old preschool teacher was finally being reunited with 
her husband, Sergey, 65. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God it is all behind us," he told her as he stepped off the Pan Am 
flight. "Why are you worried? I am here. Don't worry. Everything will be all 
right." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Beneficiaries of Glasnost 
</P>
<P>
This year, about 19,000 Soviet Jews will be allowed to emigrate to the United 
States, and about 3,000 of them will settle in or near Los Angeles. Sergey 
Pokryshevsky is one such beneficiary of glasnost, although there are hundreds 
of thousands of others still waiting. This is his story. 
</P>
<P>
A week ago last Friday, three weeks after his arrival in California, family and 
friends gathered at Temple Isaiah for an official welcome. The Pokryshevskys, 
their two children and two grandchildren sat in the temple lobby amid a crowd, 
basking in the warmth of the moment, smiling at well-wishers and photographers' 
flashing bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
Lucy Pokryshevsky, demonstrating the patience that has prompted temple parents 
to marvel at her manner with children, brightly answered questions as her 
husband embraced the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"All my children," he proclaimed proudly in fragile English. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, Sergey Pokryshevsky stood boldly before the congregation, framed 
by an American flag fashioned by temple children out of cardboard and paper. 
Two shy but beaming young girls handed him a bouquet of roses. 
</P>
<P>
"We all hope you have a terrific life in the United States of America," said 
Rabbi Robert T. Gan. "Welcome to America. Welcome to Temple Isaiah. We're glad 
you're here, Sergey." 
</P>
<P>
Slowly and warmly, he responded: "My dear friends and my dear children, I am 
very appreciate you for everything that I have, to be here today with you and 
my family." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Years of Frustration 
</P>
<P>
For the Pokryshevskys, the night marked a dramatic end to nearly 20 years of 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
The family first started planning to leave the Soviet Union in 1970. As with 
many Soviet Jews who try to leave, Mrs. Pokryshevsky said, the initial push 
came from their children, who were drawn to greater freedom and opportunity in 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
The road to their departure was not smooth. The initial obstacle was that 
Pokryshevsky had worked for 10 years as a radio engineer at a military 
electronics plant in Kiev, where the couple lived. Under Soviet law, all those 
involved in secret defense work had to wait five years before receiving exit 
visas. So in 1973, he retired from the factory and began the wait, meanwhile 
finding work as an electrician. 
</P>
<P>
In hopes that it would expedite matters, the Pokryshevskys divorced each other 
in 1976, after 23 years of marriage. Mrs. Pokryshevsky and their daughter Alla, 
then 21, and son Dmitry, 18, obtained exit visas and left for America in 
January, 1977. The father, they figured, would follow in six months to a year. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, 12 years dragged by. 
</P>
<P>
Sergey Pokryshevsky bitterly made the rounds of Soviet bureaucracy. In 1980 he 
suffered a stroke but continued his fight to leave. He spent two weeks in jail 
after the 1987 Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Moscow for taking part in a protest 
against the repression of Soviet Jews. He missed the birth of two 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"On a daily basis, he would go to 20 offices at the Central Committee office 
building, government offices, the KGB, all of them" to ask for his release, 
said his son-in-law, Lev Yasnogorosky. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'State Security' 
</P>
<P>
Soviet authorities blocked Pokryshevsky's departure citing "state security" 
requirements. Advocates for refuseniks say that the designation is one of 
political expedience, applied to many would-be emigres. Said one Jewish 
Federation Council official: "It's very vague and very useful." 
</P>
<P>
Lucy Pokryshevsky, meanwhile, settled in Denver with relatives. Having been 
proficient at five languages in the Soviet Union, she found work teaching 
Russian at a private school and providing day care at a Jewish temple. When 
Alla married four years later, the mother followed her daughter and son-in-law 
to Los Angeles. Working alone or with her children, she continued making 
government contacts, hoping to find the combination that would win her 
husband's release. 
</P>
<P>
"From the beginning when we left Russia, we started to fight," Mrs. 
Pokryshevsky recalled. 
</P>
<P>
But from an international relations standpoint, their timing was poor. In 1979, 
the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. Soon afterward, a new U.S. President, Ronald 
Reagan, was lashing out against the "evil empire" and as the years passed, Lucy 
Pokryshevsky struggled with no apparent effect. She was teaching Hebrew to 3- 
to 5-year-olds at the Los Angeles temple when help arrived. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Citizen 
</P>
<P>
"She was living in our community, teaching in our school, and we didn't really 
know anything about her," marveled Rabbi Gan. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, she became a U.S. citizen and returned briefly to Kiev, to remarry her 
husband. That was when her American friends began to organize. 
</P>
<P>
"We formed a committee," Gan said. "We wrote letters to government officials 
both here and in the Soviet Union." The group targeted industrialist Armand 
Hammer, the White House, numerous senators, representatives and State 
Department officials. At the temple, the congregation held special Hanukkah 
services and incorporated Sergey Pokryshevsky's plight into his wife's 
preschool lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"We wrote a storybook for the children at their preschool level about a man who 
wanted to leave (his country) and be reunited with his children," said Susan 
Sanders Witkow, one of those at the temple who coordinated efforts for Sergey's 
release. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Void in Her Life 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the community's motivation were simple. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the thing that was most shocking to us as parents of the preschool 
was, here is the woman who provided the love and nurturing for our children, 
who makes it easy for us to take them from the home to the school, and she had 
this tremendous void in her life. She had been so good to our children. . . . 
We wanted to give to her what she gave to the children," Witkow said. 
</P>
<P>
Whether it was because of work by the family and their friends, or simply 
because of a change in the international political climate, Pokryshevsky 
unexpectedly got permission to leave the Soviet Union this spring. The decision 
came with a typical absence of warning, and with no explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"I will tell you honestly it was sudden, because a couple of months before, 
they refused him again and they told him 1992," his wife said. Three months 
later, he was told he could go. 
</P>
<P>
"We give most of the credit to (Soviet leader Mikhail S.) Gorbachev and 
glasnost," Witkow said. "We were very lucky our timing was right." 
</P>
<P>
Now the couple, who live in West Hollywood, is busy putting politics behind 
them, trying to forge their own American dream. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time to go on from here," Lucy Pokryshevsky tells friends. 
</P>
<P>
She translates for her husband -- who has renamed himself "Sam" -- and is 
visibly happier, friends say. "She smiles a lot more," Witkow says, "She was 
always a smiler, but now it's different. . . . That burden she carried around 
for 12 1/2 years, 13 years, it's lifted." 
</P>
<P>
Pokryshevsky has begun studying English. He has met his grandchildren and is 
getting reacquainted with a daughter who is a computer programmer and a son who 
is a mechanical engineer. Mrs. Pokryshevsky's students, who greeted him at the 
airport with paper doves and flowers, now call him their adopted grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
His son-in-law relays a message for him. 
</P>
<P>
"He says he sees a lot of smiling faces here, everybody welcomes him, which is 
different from the Soviet Union," Yasnogorosky reports. 
</P>
<P>
"He smells freedom."

KISS AND YELL; 
</P>
<P>
EX-LOVER BY ELEANOR BERGSTEIN (RANDOM HOUSE: $17.95; 352 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Julia Cameron, Cameron is a free-lance writer living in Chicago. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I think of him at night . . ." screenwriter Eleanor Bergstein opens her second 
novel, "Ex-Lover." "It astounds me that I'm here and he's not. At times like 
this I cannot imagine my stomach without his pressing against it. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, we are meant to read this novel as a memento mori. We are also meant 
to read it as an elegy, a long goodby to a love that's "dead and gone" as they 
say in country and Western songs. This may be difficult since the book has more 
to do with "cheatin' hearts." 
</P>
<P>
Bergstein's heroine is Jessie Gerard, a "Playwright's Horizon playwright," who 
is happily married to Sam, an engineer. Jessie has recently suffered a number 
of losses -- a rash of family deaths, the loss of a best friend to suicide, and 
the loss of her own creativity to writer's block. In an attempt at recovery, 
she has undertaken an assignment "for the worst magazine I read cover to 
cover." 
</P>
<P>
She thinks she's slumming. 
</P>
<P>
Her assignment is to cover a movie being shot on the streets of Manhattan. She 
covers more than that. Midway through the shoot, she takes a lover, the 
ex-lover of the title. He's got a fatal disease and she's got a fatal 
attraction. When a certain someone is found hacked to pieces, the phrase, "He's 
to die for" takes on a literal ring. We've got a plethora of suspects -- among 
them the soon-to-be ex-lover. Given her killer prose, the playwright-heroine is 
not exactly above suspicion, either. After all, she does fantasize about her 
husband, ". . . with a sudden bite, crunch, could tear, destroy him. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, that's our heroine . . . and she likes him. 
</P>
<P>
Although the book's dust jacket describes it as a "thriller," the term 
"chiller" might be more accurate. "My blood ran cold" is an understandable 
readerly response to Gerard's cold-blooded descriptions of "lovers" past and 
present. For all her artistic credentials, Gerard is essentially a gutter 
fighter. Recalling the theater director she slept with on her way up -- and 
again on his way back down -- she reports: 
</P>
<P>
"I was so full of throbbing expectation and careful notation that I scarcely 
noticed how indifferent it was . . . He came back years later. He needed me for 
his career, and that made him much more fervent in my bed." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the nastier surprises in "Ex-Lover" spring from character development, 
not plot. Fighting with an actress who won't make a timely commitment to one of 
her plays, our playwright snaps, ". . . I can't wait for you a year for the 
play. It's about a woman in peak childbearing years." 
</P>
<P>
As a heroine, Jessie Gerard is so relentlessly self-involved, so 
narcissistically self-centered, you begin to gather that the book is really 
about how lovable she is -- not about whom she loves. How can she really love 
anyone when the whole point of focus is whether or not they love her? 
</P>
<P>
Describing her dead lover, playwright Gerard muses, "My face grows warm to his 
look and I smile back, think I know what he is thinking watching me . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Describing her initial meeting with Sam, her husband, Gerard again sees the 
encounter in very self-referential terms, "When I first saw Sam I said, 'Oh, 
I'll be all right.' " 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps not coincidentally, she suffers from myopia and wears thick glasses, 
although she's got a fantasy to go with them: ". . . The thicker the glasses, 
the more inevitable it is that one of them will paw my backbone with his index 
finger and say, 'You know, under those big glasses, you could be a lovely 
woman.' " 
</P>
<P>
With a focus as large as her talent, Bergstein could be a lovely writer. 
Instead, she has confined herself to that newest and nastiest literary genre, 
"Kiss and Yell," unfortunately a particular favorite among New York literary 
ladies. 
</P>
<P>
As a genre, Kiss and Yell is characterized by the wrongs done to its heroines 
who are very special and should not be treated so badly. Villains tend to be 
ex-husbands or ex-lovers. Characters tend to be thinly disguised players in the 
novelist's own lives. Art bears such a close resemblance to life it seems 
Xeroxed. "Venting" is a primary function of Kiss and Yell. Evening the score -- 
personally or professionally -- is another. Psychologists of the "Get It Out" 
school would surely approve -- especially since they often appear as minor, but 
sympathetic, characters. 
</P>
<P>
Hell hath no fury like a writer scorned. Gifted writers Erica Jong, Ellen 
Schwaam and Nora Ephron, did not mince words, just meat, in describing their 
unhappy marriages. Retaliatory affairs would have seemed like mercy killings 
compared to the character assassinations accomplished with their poisoned pens. 
No wonder the pen is mightier than the sword. What swordsman could ignore the 
possibility of bad reviews? 
</P>
<P>
Central to the successful practice of the Kiss and Yell genre is a withering 
sexual preoccupation on the part of our heroines. Former studio executive Susan 
Braudy, who numbers several prominent film makers on her romantic resume, 
skewered them (or their body double facsimiles) thoroughly in her book, "What 
the Movies Made Me Do." 
</P>
<P>
Which title brings us to another convention of Kiss and Yell. 
</P>
<P>
All Kiss and Yell heroines are innocent victims. If the movies didn't make them 
do it, then the sexual inadequacy or promiscuity of their husbands and lovers 
did. These are NICE GIRLS, make no mistake. They did not deserve what happened 
to them. Whatever they did in return (like write these books) was just to clear 
the slate. Those men needed to be shown they were accountable . . . . 
</P>
<P>
Fine. If only our heroines held themselves accountable too. But no . . . . 
</P>
<P>
When Jessie Gerard takes a lover, it is to spare her husband her excessive 
grief, heremotional dryness. At least, that's her story and we are asked to 
believe it. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted only to eliminate all the fluids that would have scalded him, bathed 
him in bitter acid . . . . I never saw it as having been unfaithful to Sam." 
</P>
<P>
Of course not. As she is quick to tell us, both of her infidelities to Sam had 
to do with being true to herself and sparing him her Angst by medicating it 
with an extra-marital lover. 
</P>
<P>
"I did what I had to do" is the sub-text of Kiss and Yell. "I slept with him to 
save my marriage." 
</P>
<P>
You what? 
</P>
<P>
As unbelievable as such rationalizations sound in print, there are people who 
believe them in real life. It would appear that who's who and what's what have 
very little in common -- except, perhaps, "W." 
</P>
<P>
Another oddity of the Kiss and Yell genre (KY for short) is that its 
practitioners tend to suffer a certain confusion about sex and food. Or perhaps 
about sex and nurturing. Oral sex is sandwiched in as often as possible. Sexual 
appetite and sexual gluttony become indistinguishable. To hear these heroines 
tell it, they are marvelously sexual themselves but frequently disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
"A great appetite for life" is the euphemistic phrase -- great appetite seldom 
implying selectivity. It is the stylistic convention of Kiss and Yell to "Tell 
All." . . . And "all" is sometimes more than the sexually squeamish might wish. 
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Bergstein is a writer of power and ability, a shrewd, if sometimes 
shrewish, observer. ("He's lewd and funny, and looks -- ugly as he is -- as if 
he'll be a real woman lover in bed. Fat men often are.") Witty, angry, strident 
and seductive, she is sensual and sexual in her descriptions. To those who know 
her best as the screenwriter-co-producer of "Dirty Dancing," this sexual core 
should come as no surprise. As literary territories go, "colorful" and 
"off-color" lie awfully near to one another. They lead "adjacent lives" as 
Schwaam might put it, and the boundaries often become blurred. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the shooting of a long awaited scene, Bergstein writes, ". . . 
there's a short burst of energy when we shoot it. And then it's over. Like 
buying a great nightgown for bad sex." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, like Joan Rivers, she can be very funny. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, I sat on a sofa in Carl Bernstein's Washington apartment and 
listened to two New York Literary Ladies discussing a man who might best be 
described as a literary groupie. He collected Literary Ladies. Or they 
collected him. Having collected them, they dissected him -- a conversational 
precursor to Kiss and Yell. Here is what I heard them say: 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know X?" 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yes." 
</P>
<P>
"Without him I'm not sure I could have kept my marriage together the last two 
years." 
</P>
<P>
For both speakers, X was an "ex-lover." I would say that they used the phrase 
loosely but perhaps calling someone your "lover" no longer implies love. In the 
world of "Ex-Lover," sexual exchange and love become indistinguishable. "Our 
fury was so great it turned into permanent loving," playwright Gerard tells us 
at the end. Our heroine was still deceiving poor old Sam. She was still 
describing a love of intrigue that smacked of a dangerous liaison. What's love 
got to do with it? I wondered. 
</P>
<P>
As they say in the movies, I may be a little out of sync.

RICHARD EDER: 'IT WAS GREAT, AND DON'T CALL ME, I'LL CALL YOU'; 
</P>
<P>
LUST AND OTHER STORIES BY SUSAN MINOT (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN/SEYMOUR 
LAWRENCE:$17.50; 147 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Susan Minot's young women, entreaty is a one-way street. Men entreat them 
meltingly. 
</P>
<P>
"They look at you seriously, their eyes at a low burn and their hands no matter 
what starting off shy and with such a gentle touch that the only thing you can 
do is take that tenderness and let yourself be swept away." 
</P>
<P>
The speaker in "Lust," the title story of this collection, is winding up her 
litany of male neediness and of all the different times it has ravaged her. For 
her, entreaty is irresistible. For Minot's men, on the other hand, it is 
unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
When Meg, in the story "Ile Seche," grows dizzy climbing a steep hill, her 
lover steadies her for an instant and then strides ahead, frozen. Her need is a 
threat; so is her sensibility. He can point out the view from the hill but when 
she asks him to notice the light as well, it crowds him. 
</P>
<P>
The stories in "Lust" are sketches and vignettes that embroider a single theme. 
Between the sexes in the urban, educated and affluent set, the woman's lot is 
as bad as it's ever been and maybe worse. It is not only entreaty that is a 
one-way street; it is sex as well. 
</P>
<P>
Sex, as the title indicates, is what the transactions are all about. It makes a 
constricted focus, not amenable to much development. The energy and 
individuality of Minot's sentences are remarkable, as they were in her first 
book, "Monkeys." There, they illuminated the life, rhythms and death of a 
family. Here they have much less to work on. 
</P>
<P>
The perceptions of Minot's young protagonists are so seamless in their 
up-to-the-minute state of awareness as to approach brainwashing. Yet the point 
of their morality tales is old-fashioned -- which is not a fault -- and tinnily 
repetitive -- which is. "It was great, and don't call me, I'll call you," it 
goes or, more plainly, "Men were deceivers ever." 
</P>
<P>
Repetition works best in the title story. The speaker, in her late teens, gives 
us a list of a dozen or so boys with whom she has had sex at boarding school, a 
place that has more than a passing resemblance to Minot's own school, Concord 
Academy. The tone is as dispassionate and precise as Bret Easton Ellis' or Jay 
McInerney's, but Minot, a far better writer, has a quiet wavering that lets 
pain show through. 
</P>
<P>
Her notes on each boy are clinical, like a lab record or an FBI surveillance 
report. She speaks of "the first one I ever saw nude," annotates the looks of 
different boys' genitals, discusses their techniques. There is a distance 
between each encounter and her feelings; a familiar literary coolness. 
</P>
<P>
What is less familiar and where the wavering begins, is when she turns to the 
feelings themselves. The distance is now between the feelings and the "I." "He 
had a halo from the campus light behind him. I flipped." That should be 
headlong -- "I flipped" is shorthand for "I was passionately thrilled" -- but 
it isn't. "I" has lost the sovereignty not only of her body (she cannot 
withhold herself because she hates "teases") but also of what she feels. 
</P>
<P>
Only at the end of the list and the notes does sovereignty begin to trickle 
back. "You start to get tired. You begin to feel diluted like watered-down 
stew," she tells us. "After sex, you curl up like a shrimp, something deep 
inside you ruined, slammed in a place that sickens at slamming. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The recognition could be glib. Something perfectly familiar has happened; the 
girl has been used, has cooperated, and regrets it. To be able to voice the 
regret is something, though; perhaps a first step out of anomie. And the 
discrimination of Minot's voice gives this first step a promising energy. 
</P>
<P>
The glibness is greater, and the energy of the voice less, in many of the other 
pieces. The girl is now a young woman a few years out in the world. She is 
several different young women, in fact, but the same thing keeps happening to 
her. The men are older, more experienced, more powerful. They reach out to 
their quarry and take possession; when the woman tries to reach back, they move 
off. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to distinguish some of these stories from each other. The men that 
figure in them could just about be the same man. And the young women are all 
hurt in more or less the same way: by thinking that their lovers' attention 
promises a mutual relationship and finding out that it doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
Each ends with a mordant incident or reflection; a kind of ironic kicker 
intended to clinch the point, but which makes it slighter and more obvious. In 
"Ile Seche," for instance, Meg -- a young actress vacationing with a successful 
producer -- thinks of the motorboats in the harbor, and reflects: 
</P>
<P>
"She would not be coming home in one piece after all. She would be run over, 
chopped up by a propeller, an innocent swimmer in what she knew were dangerous 
waters." 
</P>
<P>
In "A Thrilling Life," the protagonist, whose lover has left her, imagines her 
successor with the same smugly-dreamy expression she herself wore when in 
favor. In "Lunch With Harry," a woman knows she's slipping when her older 
lover, impatient at her slowness in getting into a cab, calls her by the name 
of a former mistress -- with whom, as things faded, he no doubt had been 
equally impatient. 
</P>
<P>
There is a similar sequence in "The Feather in the Toque" when a woman finds 
the photograph of another woman in her lover's summer house, discovers a 
tortoise-shell comb on a bathroom shelf, thinks for a moment it belongs to a 
rival, and then recognizes it as her own. She puts it back, "leaving something 
of herself for the next woman to find." 
</P>
<P>
These are devices, small traps that spring to fix an emotional moment. And it 
is the same emotional moment, time and again.

Minot's writing is an explorer's glass of extraordinary focus and illumination. 
In "Lust" she has asked far too little of it. It is made to be trained, as it 
was in "Monkeys," on the wilds of the world and the heart, and not simply on 
its nearby and familiar entanglements.

VIETNAM: ONE WOMAN'S STORY; 
</P>
<P>
WHEN HEAVEN AND EARTH CHANGED PLACES BY LE LY HAYSLIP WITH JAY WURTS; 
(DOUBLEDAY:$18.95; 368 PP.) 
</P>

By Lynne Bundesen, Bundesen lived in Southeast Asia for four years. Her memoir 
will be published next year by Simon &amp; Schuster.

<TEXT>
<P>
It is said that on the day when some one woman, any woman, finally succeeds in 
telling the truth about her life, the world will be split in two. Millions of 
us are waiting for that day, watching for it, nurturing its possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Le Ly Hayslip's memoir of the War in Vietnam is not the book that will split 
the world in two, but it is that kind of book. It should be required reading in 
military colleges and in high schools and universities looking for broader, 
more personal interpretations of geo-politics. It may speak most piercingly to 
Asians and Amer-Asians, especially Amer-Asian children, but it should be heard 
by any man -- and especially any woman -- who cares about life on our planet. 
</P>
<P>
These are strong words about a book that has some troubling flaws. But its 
overarching theme -- that the innocent victims are not nameless people but 
individual human beings -- is an essential message in a world that measures 
history by its wars and body counts. Le Ly Hayslip's narrative of her life as a 
child in a Vietnamese village overrun by the French, the Viet Cong, the 
Republican Army of South Vietnam, the Americans, the Viet Cong, the 
Republicans, the Americans, etc., etc., etc. is painful stuff. Of course it is. 
It's real. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time her life is the stuff of a mini-series -- or would be if 
television ever learned to view Eastern lives as fully human and not simply as 
a part of the scenery behind Western lives. Le Ly Hayslip lives with war as a 
child. At puberty she is tortured, then raped. Later, and not because of the 
rape, she has a child out of wedlock. She buries her father. She reveres her 
ancestors. She struggles, survives, marries one American, then another. Peasant 
child, she becomes successful in the world of capitalism and returns to her 
home in Vietnam with a book in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Of course. She is an American now, a Southern Californian. She has an 
individuality, a story to tell, a purpose. Her purpose is to heal, to tell what 
it was and is like to be nothing more than the dust of the earth in the eyes of 
men who carry weapons and to rise from that dust a functioning, generous, alive 
being. To illustrate her message that the victim is not nameless, not 
powerless, she tells how she survived, whom she met and how she felt as a 
Vietnamese woman in horrific times and circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Her story, "When Heaven and Earth Changed Places," is the private side of the 
Vietnamese war. The private side of any war is rarely told, and it is, 
supremely, the woman's side. We are used to war stories told from the point of 
view of the soldier, the journalist, the historian, the expert. Hayslip gives 
us the point of view of Anywoman, combining her autobiography with an 
eyewitness acount of Vietnam's history over the last 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
As a memoir her story is a revealing disclosure of her feminine psyche. I 
suffered with her through her descriptions of torture. I was with her as she 
crawled into bed with her pain and virginal blood after the rape. I understood 
why, when still a young woman, she took her employer into her bed. What I did 
not and do not understand is why, given her history, she remains a romantic. 
</P>
<P>
When Hayslip makes her return trip to Southeast Asia after a decade and a half 
in the United States, she meets a Norwegian working there, describing their 
encounter with a wistful, helpless romantic view. Norwegian men, who live in a 
country run by women, are notoriously unmoved by helplessness; and either I 
missed some subtext in this encounter, or Hayslip looks on any man as a 
helpmeet. Hopeful about men I can understand. But romantic I cannot quite 
grasp. When Hayslip, with her experience, drifts into thinking of a man as a 
source of protection, someone who will make things better, I conclude that 
romance outlives all political regimes. 
</P>
<P>
As autobiography, this book is beyond criticism. Who has not the right to tell 
her story as she experienced it? But as history, the book lacks specificity. 
Specificity is what makes history work. On such and such a date, in a town of 
so many people, at a spot x meters from the edge of town -- coordinates like 
these fix things in our minds and clarify the muddy whirl of events. That Le Ly 
Hayslip, given her age at the time and her circumstances, may be unable to 
recall such key details would not be important if she admitted it or, better, 
if she could offer some reasons for her selectivity. 
</P>
<P>
But she does not, and I got lost in her text trying to figure out what was 
happening when. I could see her standing in her worker's pajamas in the rice 
fields, giving warning to the Viet Cong, but I could not place that scene on a 
larger landscape. As a result, the endless wars and invasions became merely the 
backdrop of her personal life. Legitimate and deeply revealing as those events 
may be when seen in this way, they do have another kind of meaning for millions 
of others. 
</P>
<P>
The line between individuality and history is a fine one, of course, and 
individuality in Asia may be at a kind of turning point -- witness China today. 
As a book poised on this line, "When Heaven and Earth Change Places" is of 
considerable importance. It could have been better. The definitive book by a 
Vietnamese woman in this last half of the century has yet to be written. While 
we wait for that book, however, Le Ly Hayslips' is the book we must read.

BOY TALK;

DEAD LANGUAGES BY DAVID SHIELDS (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $18.95; 248 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It is hard work nowadays to write what the Germans call a Bildungsroman, an 
autobiographical novel of growing up. Though it is a form that most first 
novelists find inescapable, the great challenge is to make something new, 
something that cannot be labeled merely an also-ran to Joyce or Hesse or Spark 
or Salinger. Each year the competition grows fiercer as the unexplored portions 
of this particular literary rain forest shrink in size. One must find either a 
new way to say the old things (in a time when new ways seem to have been 
exhausted in the frenzies of modernism and post-modernism) or, even more 
difficult, something new to say. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, there appear to be three solutions. One is charm. Even if you are 
only saying the old things in the old way, the charm of your youthful self, the 
fresh and tender haplessness of your own true exploits, just slightly 
exaggerated, can carry the day and delight everyone but the purse-lipped 
purist. Another, less common solution is to offer new subject matter. But this 
usually depends on the author having grown up illiterate or a white slave or 
suckled by wolves -- though, I can hear the weary voice at the editorial 
conference, wolves have been done. The third route is to resist the temptation 
to begin with your own childhood -- or, barring that, to write the damn thing 
and lock it in a drawer. Then having got the rite-of-passage business out of 
your system, you can go on to explore your real subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
David Shields nearly chose the third route. He wrote the first draft of "Dead 
Languages" while a student in creative writing at Iowa but could not get it 
published. His second novel (and first to be published) is called "Heroes." It 
concerns the moral dilemma of a middle-aged sportswriter (hardly Bildungsroman 
material), and it received excellent notices. But Shields could not resist the 
temptation to take "Dead Languages" out of its drawer and rework it. 
</P>
<P>
The result is not charming. Shield's protagonist is Jeremy Zorn, a lifelong 
stutterer in a family of female overachievers. Mother, articulate to a fault, 
is a leftish political journalist, whom the boy both idolizes and dreads. 
Sister Beth, "too fat to have fun," wins all the medals, gets her thesis 
published, and plays classical guitar. Father, an underemployed 
manic-depressive, must occasionally be put away and "juiced." Out of such 
material one could of course make anything. But Shields cannot make of it 
either comedy or tragedy, just 200-odd pages of low-grade pain. Pain may be too 
noble a word. Irritation is closer to the mark. 
</P>
<P>
I wish Shields could enjoy his characters more -- they are so obviously up for 
it. I could imagine Mother played by an imperious Bette Midler with lines 
written for her by Geoffrey Chaucer. But Shields seems not to have heard that 
characters can be both outrageous and lovable. His protagonist keeps saying 
such things as: "I have always had too many anxieties of my own to have much 
patience with other people's problems." Sigh. 
</P>
<P>
The stuttering is supposed to provide us with a post-modern metaphor for the 
inadequacy of all language and the impossibility of genuine communion ("Between 
me and life that can be touched there has always been a fence"), but it does 
nothing of the sort. Despite Mother's black swimsuit, which is "ugly," and the 
sand dunes, which are "hideous," and the "slime mold" that clings to the dock, 
and many similar touches, it is not possible to believe that privileged little 
Jeremy is really a character out of Camus. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the Angst-striking seems so relished that one can't help howl (with 
laughter). I am reminded of Chesterton's lines: 
</P>
<P>
 Now you mention it 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the sky 
</P>
<P>
 is like a large mouth 
</P>
<P>
 shown to a dentist, 
</P>
<P>
 and I never noticed 
</P>
<P>
 a little thing 
</P>
<P>
 like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy's problem, after all, is that he stutters a little. He too achieves in 
class, on the playing field, in his chosen work. He has nothing of his poor 
father's affliction -- which the reader has more sympathy for than Jeremy ever 
exhibits. No, he doesn't connect awfully well with the opposite sex (none of 
the extra-familial females are anything but transient vapors), but the problem 
is not sexual dysfunction. Jeremy has no trouble masturbating. Jeremy just 
loves Jeremy. 
</P>
<P>
In a book in which language is portrayed as "eclips(ing) life," it would be 
nice to report that the language is overpowering. Instead, it makes the reader 
feel like "mixed pickles," as the English say. Here is a young writer straining 
for Irving's facility or even Updike's airy grace but, for all his bench 
pressing, just giving himself a literary hernia. Toward the end, he makes a 
terrible mistake. After scores of cutesy hommages to great modernists ("rain 
was general all over Los Angeles"), he gives us an extended quotation from "To 
the Lighthouse" -- and the passage rises like a mesa in a desert and thrills us 
with the mysterious power of real creativity.

A GUIDE TO THE CLASSICS; 
</P>
<P>
THE OXFORD COMPANION TO CLASSICAL LITERATURE SECOND EDITION EDITED BY M.C. 
HOWATSON (OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS: $39.95; 605 PP., CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE, MAPS; 
0-19-866121-5)

<P>
By Nicholas Goodhue, Goodhue is the author of several publications in the field 
of classical archeology. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A revised edition of Sir Paul Harvey's "Oxford Companion to Classical 
Literature," originally published in 1937, has long been overdue. The task of 
revision has been admirably carried out by Margaret Howatson in this second 
edition. The object aimed at is unchanged: to provide "a handbook of 
information for readers of the literatures of Greece and Rome, and of modern 
works which (touch) upon the classical world" (Howatson's preface). But to 
attain this object in 1989 requires taking account not only of the many new 
discoveries and reappraisals that have been made in the last half-century but 
also of the fact that the reader of today cannot be presumed to have the 
background of knowledge of the classical world that could be taken for granted 
in the reader of 1937. 
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, in her revision of Harvey, Howatson not only has incorporated the 
archeological and other findings that have furthered and in some cases 
substantially altered our understanding of certain aspects of classical 
civilization, but also has added new articles and expanded others so as to make 
the book suitable "for any reader who is curious to find out about the 
classical world." All Greek and Latin quotations, which the reader of 1937 was 
expected to be able to read unassisted, are now accompanied by English 
translations. 
</P>
<P>
Like all the Oxford "Companions," this one is in dictionary format, consisting 
of alphabetically arranged articles of widely varying length and generality, 
some of them dealing with particular names and terms in a few lines, others 
taking up several pages to treat broad subjects such as philosophy, religion, 
and education. Each of the classical authors is the subject of an article under 
the name of that author that provides a general account of the author's works 
and his or her place in the literary and historical scene; important individual 
works are summarized and discussed in separate entries under the title of the 
work. Literary forms are covered under such headwords as epic, tragedy, comedy, 
historiography, oratory, and lyric poetry. The reader curious to know why the 
term classical often means "ancient Greek and Roman" (as in the title of this 
book) will find an explanation under "classic (classics, classical)." There are 
major articles on Athens and Rome, subdivided into sections on topography, 
history, administration, and economy. Sculpture, architecture, and painting are 
discussed under those words as well as in many related articles on particular 
artists, monuments, and genres (extensive cross-referencing helps the reader to 
find all that is relevant to the subject of interest). 
</P>
<P>
New articles added by Howatson include "astronomy," "Christianity in the Roman 
world," "gods" (dealing with the canonical 12 gods of the Greek pantheon), 
"homosexuality," "polis" (in which the meaning of Aristotle's statement that 
"man is a political animal" is explained), "postal service," and numerous 
others. Other articles have been substantially enlarged. The entries that 
summarize individual books, poems, and plays are still Harvey's (in the main), 
but in general very little has been left unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
The new "Companion" seems thoroughly up to date. Full account is taken of the 
decipherment in 1952 of the script known as Linear B and of the implications of 
that decipherment for our knowledge of early Greek civilization: Not only is 
there a new article "Linear A and B," but references to the decipherment have 
been added elsewhere as appropriate (in the articles on Crete, Greece, and 
Mycenae, among others). The "Riace Bronzes," two bronze statues recovered from 
the sea off Italy in 1972, are mentioned in "sculpture." The discovery of the 
tomb of Philip of Macedon at Vergina is discussed. Note is taken of the fact 
that Aeschylus' "The Suppliants," previously believed to be his earliest extant 
play, has been found to be of later date; the increasingly prevalent view that 
the "Prometheus Bound" is not by Aeschylus is referred to as well. A new entry 
is devoted to Menander's comedy "Dyscolus," which was found on papyri published 
in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
It is appropriate that a handbook to classical literature intended for the 
general reader should pay particular attention to matters that may be the 
subject of popular misconception. For example, the image of the priestess of 
the Delphic Oracle as delivering her prophecies while seated over a chasm from 
which "mephitic vapors" arose has a long history, but Howatson rightly notes 
that there is no good archeological or literary evidence for either the chasm 
or the vapors. She could have added that the notion that the Oracle's responses 
typically were equivocal or ambiguous (an idea so firmly rooted that among the 
senses of the English words Delphic and oracular listed in any dictionary one 
is likely to find something like obscure, ambiguous, enigmatic) is likewise not 
true of any of the Delphic pronouncements regarded as definitely authentic. 
Correcting Harvey, she explains that Pandora's Box was actually a large jar 
(pithos) and became a box only in later accounts through confusion with another 
story (Cupid and Psyche). As with Harvey, she makes it express that Cleopatra 
was Greek by descent, not "Oriental" or "African." 
</P>
<P>
One common misconception not adequately dealt with by Howatson concerns the god 
Apollo: She has retained unchanged Harvey's statement that Apollo was "the god 
of light, sometimes identified with the sun," but it has long been established 
that Apollo was not originally a light-god or a sun-god and that his 
identification with the sun was confined to the speculations of learned 
philosophers until the Hellenistic period at the earliest (Joseph Fontenrose 
has shown that not even in the words of Ovid and other Latin poets of his time 
is Apollo identified with the sun, as commonly supposed). Under "Paris, 
Judgment of," Howatson retains Harvey's view that the Judgment is not mentioned 
by Homer, but this view is based on the assumption that lines 25-30 of book 24 
of the Iliad are not genuine, an assumption not now generally shared (I owe 
this observation to Prof. Steven Lattimore of UCLA). 
</P>
<P>
The preface states that "some guidance is given in the headwords to their 
pronunciation in English," but the marking of vowel lengths is sporadic and 
sometimes erroneous (even allowing for differences between British and American 
usage). Those especially interested in the English pronunciation of classical 
names will find Catherine Avery's "New Century Classical Handbook" more useful 
for that purpose (out of print, but available in libraries). 
</P>
<P>
It should be remarked that Harvey's frequent citations of "interesting points 
of connexion between the classics and medieval and modern English literature" 
(Harvey's preface) have in this edition been substantially truncated or dropped 
altogether, evidently because of the need to make room for new material and 
presumably reflecting a judgment that today's reader is less likely than 
Harvey's was to be interested in references to classical allusions in Milton, 
Shakespeare, or Spenser. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the volume is a chronological table setting forth historical and 
literary events in parallel columns, and a set of maps of the classical world. 
This excellent new edition of an old standby can be highly recommended to 
anyone interested in classical civilization and its legacy.

EXCERPT;

<P>
THE SAINT OF HEDONISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was once in the south of India a hedonistic king who valued his pleasures 
and his treasures above all things. However, this king also enjoyed intelligent 
conversation, and from time to time visitors were invited into the royal 
chamber, where he reclined on his lion throne, dressed in the most sumptuous of 
garments. 
</P>
<P>
One day, a wise yogin came to the court and was granted an audience. When the 
king saw his tattered clothing and weathered face, he was filled with pity. 
</P>
<P>
"What a terrible life you must lead, wandering from country to country in such 
a miserable state," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to complain about," the yogin replied. "You are the one to be 
pitied." 
</P>
<P>
"What makes you think such a thing?" said the king, taken aback. 
</P>
<P>
"I have eyes," said the yogin. "I can see that you live in constant dread of 
your own subjects. Above all, you fear the loss of your throne. But I, I am 
free from all suffering. The pain of old age, even death itself, is unknown to 
me. Were I to leap into a roaring fire, I would not be burned. Were I to 
swallow the deadliest of poisons, I would not die." 
</P>
<P>
"How can this be?" asked the king, amazed. 
</P>
<P>
"I have learned the great teachings of the alchemists," replied the venerable 
yogin. "I possess the secret of immortality." 
</P>
<P>
The words of the yogin affected the king so profoundly that his faith was 
kindled on the spot. "I am unable to wander from place to place as you do," he 
said, "but if you could teach me how to meditate while remaining here on my 
throne in my palace I would be very grateful. I beg you to remain long enough 
to instruct me," and he prostrated himself in humble supplication. 
</P>
<P>
The yogin granted the king's request by initiating him into the meditative 
practices of the deity Hevajra. The king learned to concentrate his attention 
unwaveringly upon the jeweled ring on his right hand. In time, he was able to 
visualize within the heart of the jewel the great Hevajra himself seated amid 
his retinue of divinities. When the king succeeded in transfixing this vision 
he united both the creative and fulfillment modes of meditation and the state 
of realization, the one-pointed trance of samadhi, spontaneously unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
Thereafter the king meditated ceaselessly. The dawning of his understanding had 
endowed him with the power and realization of mahamudra as well as other 
abilities, such as extrasensory perception. Yet he accomplished all this while 
seated upon his lion throne reclining on cushions of silk surrounded by his 
queens and ministers and entertained by the court musicians. 
</P>
<P>
His fondness for sensual pleasures soon earned him the name Lilapa, which means 
"Master of Play." Nevertheless, he became known throughout the world for 
wonderful acts of selflessness, and in the end gained the ultimate liberation 
of entering the Paradise of the Dakinis. 
</P>
<P>
Lilapa's story shows us that when the karmic leanings and aspirations of the 
disciple blend harmoniously with the teachings of the guru, there is no need to 
renounce the pleasures of this life in order to attain liberation.

NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, IN INDIA IS SIMPLE; 
</P>
<P>
THEN SPOKE THE THUNDER BY ELWYN CHAMBERLAIN (GROVE PRESS: $19.95; 240 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Laura Richardson, Writer Richardson lived in New Delhi, India, 1984-88. She 
now lives in Paris.

<TEXT>
<P>
In India, the will to believe -- in ghosts, in magic, in the power of the stars 
-- is strong, not only among the profoundly ignorant, but also well-educated 
people. Dreams and visions have material reality; the outrageous and absurd 
stand unabashed alongside the mundane and practical. Politicians have staff 
astrologers. A medical doctor in Uttar Pradesh seriously explains that human 
children may be reared by wolves and bears. A respected news wire service runs 
a story about a man-eating elephant in the northeast jungles that tramples its 
victims and then sucks up their blood with its trunk. A Bombay banker advises 
that one may diagnose a bite from a rabid animal by pressing a chapatti against 
the wound, then flinging the flat bread to a scavenger dog. 
</P>
<P>
"If the dog runs away, you have rabies. If he eats the bread, you are safe," 
the man says, and everything one knows about first aid protests. 
</P>
<P>
Indian manifestations of extreme spirituality are not simply peculiar to 
Westerners, but deeply shocking: naked devotees of Krishna with skewers through 
their penises; begging naga babas clad only in filth and their own tangled 
hair; old men who have so long raised their arms in prayer, they cannot lower 
them. Walking on live coals, sitting on a bed of needles, kissing king cobras, 
scourging oneself, whirling for hours, for days: To onlookers it's all 
terrifying, horrifying, and on some level -- as it is doubtless intended to be 
-- entertaining as well. Life in India, the mother of great religions, can be 
so cruel it is some relief to see these bizarre and wonderful exemplars of 
self-sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Hinduism, the dominant Indian religion, imposes 
self-enrichment as a positive duty of the devotee, who in young manhood is to 
build up wealth and family; in old age, to leave all behind and go begging in 
search of enlightenment. The former duty appears to be the more assiduously 
performed. And as many Indian businessmen are only too happy to teach you, if 
you haven't already learned from the U.S. stock market, dishonesty is the best 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
India's contradictions are so difficult to comprehend and its culture, layer 
upon layer of ancient conquest and submission, all attended by poets and 
magicians and sorrowing women, is not merely graceful and beautiful, but 
infuriating. Nothing, absolutely nothing, is simple, and the specious 
familiarity of today's political forms and lively press, the brisk and fluent 
young men in their Japanese cars, the modish young women in jeans and jogging 
shoes buying Barbie Dolls for their daughters, only serves to heighten the 
confusion and delay the realization that one does not, cannot, understand 
modern India. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, much recent fiction about India has taken the easy way out, diving 
straight into the distant past. There, one may romance the exotic at one's 
leisure, holding hard to the comforting fact that witnesses of the era are 
dead, or at least, very few and far between. Bravely, Elwyn Chamberlain sets 
his latest novel, "Then Spoke the Thunder," at the time of Indira Gandhi's 
assassination by two of her Sikh bodyguards in October, 1984. His violence is 
new, and he also gives one another look at Indian spirituality, tossing in some 
tantrism and its unattractive initiation into the mysteries and powers. 
</P>
<P>
His main characters, the repellently rich and handsome David Bruce and his 
equally obnoxious wife Philippa, who appears to have done nothing in her life 
but be beautiful and sleep around, are dropped all unawares into India's 
present where they are, of course, Shocked and Amazed. The reader is not 
shocked, but is pleased to learn during the course of the Bruces' travels 
around India that although they appear to have absolutely everything, they are 
in fact spiritually impoverished, emotionally crippled failures crying out for 
Love and Meaning, and guess where they find it? 
</P>
<P>
Chamberlain is a dab hand at caricature, as far as subcontinentals are 
concerned, and the cast of Indian characters, speaking supposedly flawless 
Oxford or amusing Hindish, is broad and varied, ranging from the dispossessed 
princes, some of them now in straitened circumstances, others zillionaires like 
the Bruces; through gentle and eccentric geniuses, gluttonous poets, and the 
time-honored officious bureaucrats and faithful retainers; to the relatively 
new ignorant, inflamed, religious fanatics, the very stuff of which terrorists 
are made. These last are conveniently eaten by tigers. 
</P>
<P>
"Then Spoke the Thunder" is nothing if not action-packed. Death and 
destruction, heartbreak and ruin, perfidy sharper than et cetera rain down on 
every other page. The spaces in between are reserved for sex -- anticipating, 
having or remembering same. It may be necessary these days to write sex scenes 
into what aspires to be popular literature, but surely it is not necessary to 
use the word lingam. Chamberlain does.

A SMALL TROPHY FROM HER AFRICAN TOUR; 
</P>
<P>
BETWEEN TWO RAINS BY HARRIET HEYMAN (ATHENEUM: $19.95; 282 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reviewed by Carolyn Slaughter, Slaughter's most recent novel is Dreams of 
the Kalahari (Fireside Books / Simon &amp; Schuster). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A reader should always expect something fresh and original from a new novel, 
and, when we're promised a trip to Africa, expectations rise. Of course, Africa 
has been too much explored in past years for most people not to be familiar 
with the terrain: an abundance of beauty and space existing in uneasy 
juxtaposition to poverty, hunger and brutality. We have seen how the old 
colonial ways have been rediscovered by new tribes of expatriates bringing 
their cinematic dreams of Africa with them, only to succumb to the white man's 
tedious distractions of adultery and alcohol. Inevitably, they depart the 
continent with a standard repertoire of horror stories: corrupt bureaucrats, 
gratuitous military violence, the carnage of elephants for ivory. Even those 
who travel no further than the local mall will have come across at least some 
of these tales. 
</P>
<P>
So, picking up Harriet Heyman's first novel, "Between the Rains," one hopes for 
a fresh intelligence that will throw a good strong light on a unique continent. 
Sadly, we are disappointed. There are no new insights in "Between the Rains," 
and I think the author knows it. In a letter home to her boyfriend, the heroine 
perfectly expresses Heyman's own inadequacy: "She could describe the speed of 
the cats but not the thrill of tracking them. She could describe the killing, 
but not how it felt that she and Max were the only human witnesses to it." 
</P>
<P>
The book opens with a young woman, Mirie Keane, leaving Manhattan. She takes 
off for East Africa clutching a bag of photographer's equipment and some 
romantic notions about photographing an elephant giving birth -- an act never 
captured before on film. With a commission to take shots of a safari ranch, she 
meets the usual round- up of old Africa hands and expatriates and has a few 
exciting moments in the bush with wild animals. One of her photographs -- a 
gory shot of a fatal buffalo attack -- brings her notoriety and enables her to 
stay on in Africa. She shakes off the dust of her past and engages in an 
unconvincing romance with a character who has not previously given her the time 
of day. 
</P>
<P>
The book limps along as Mirie, photographs safe in her bag, sets off for the 
capital, only to run into military barricades. Soldiers ransack her belongings 
and toss her film onto rose bushes strewn with the corpses of looters killed by 
the army. Finally, reaching the airport, crowded with people making a hasty 
exodus, the plane rumbles down the runway and we catch a last look at our 
adventurer, who is giggling nervously in her seat. 
</P>
<P>
Journeys should be as spiritual as they are physical. In leaving behind the 
habits and attitudes of our everyday lives, we can be freed by the different 
rhythms of another culture and experience something unexpected and exotic -- 
both in the land and within ourselves. Herein lies one of the main problems of 
"Between the Rains." The writer too quickly connects with the disdain and 
cynicism that is so much a part of the white experience in Africa. She sees 
Africa as the expatriates do, and this accounts for the jaded and superficial 
quality of the book. It is written without the benefit of imagination and 
remains untroubled by intelligence. One tags along for the ride, but is not the 
better for it. 
</P>
<P>
The wonder of an elephant birth -- and this is the entire purpose of this 
African sojourn -- is described with astonishing banality. The birthing pains 
of a new nation, though given scant attention, are handled with the same 
careless indifference. 
</P>
<P>
"Between the Rains" seems to go to some lengths never to outreach itself, and, 
because of this, Heyman has managed to bring back only a very small trophy from 
her African adventure.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES BY JOHN KENNEDY TOOLE (GROVE PRESS: 
$8.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Toole completed "Confederacy" shortly before committing suicide in 1969, and 
his mother spent the next seven years trying to find a publisher. Her efforts 
were vindicated when it won the Pulitzer Prize in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The central character of this surprisingly assured first novel is the 
self-styled genius, Ignatius Reilly, who dwells in arrogance as a monk in 
piety. From the heights of his moral indignation, he alternately decries the 
foibles of lesser mortals and bewails the condition of his overworked pyloric 
valve. Yet Toole manages to make Ignatius an entertaining and even an endearing 
figure, despite his unbridled pomposity. 
</P>
<P>
Supported by a bizarre cast of secondary characters that includes an aspiring 
exotic danseuse, an eager but inept cop and a hip black janitor, Ignatius 
embarks on a series of improbable adventures that shatter the humid 
tranquillity of one of New Orleans' faded quarters. 
</P>
<P>
In his Introduction, Walker Percy, who helped oversee the publication of 
"Confederacy," concludes: "The tragedy of the book is the tragedy of the author 
-- his suicide in 1969 at the age of thirty-two. Another tragedy is the body of 
work we have been denied."

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: ELEPHANT MEMORIES THIRTEEN YEARS IN THE LIFE OF AN ELEPHANT 
FAMILY BY CYNTHIA MOSS(FAWCETT COLUMBINE: $10.95, ILLUSTRATED) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moss offers a scholarly but highly readable account of the complex social 
behavior of the elephants in Kenya's Amboseli Park. 
</P>
<P>
In the most intriguing chapters, Moss presents evidence that these intelligent 
animals have a concept of death. They bury their dead and, unlike other 
animals, recognize skeletons of their own species. When elephants encounter 
another's bones, they caress them with their trunks, paying special attention 
to the skulls of relatives. 
</P>
<P>
African elephants are finding those remains with alarming frequency: 80,000 
elephants -- almost 10% of the total population in Africa -- are slaughtered 
each year for their ivory. As elephants produce one calf every three to five 
years, the species obviously can't sustain this decimation. 
</P>
<P>
But Moss concludes that competition for space with a burgeoning human 
population may pose an even greater threat. The population of Kenya is expected 
to double by the end of the century, and much of the arable land in the country 
is prime elephant habitat. Although Moss argues eloquently for their 
protection, the extinction of the African elephant appears imminent.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: BEST EDITORIAL CARTOONS OF THE YEAR 1989 EDITION EDITED BY 
CHARLES BROOKS (PELICAN: $9.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 17th collection in this series fails to live up to its title for the same 
reason as the previous installments. The most innovative cartoonists in the 
United States tend to be liberals; Brooks prefers conservative ideology to 
artistic excellence. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 14 cartoonists who have won the Pulitzer Prize since the series began, 
only six are included. Pat Oliphant, Herb Block (Herblock), Tony Auth, Jeff 
MacNelly and Don Wright are conspicuously absent. In their place, Brooks 
presents derivative, second- and third-rate work that lacks the incisive edge 
needed to fix an image in the reader's mind. The weakest drawings also reflect 
fuzzy thinking: One cartoon calls for a "happy medium" between "The Polluters' 
World" and "The Environmentalists' World," which suggests that certain levels 
of pollution may be desirable. 
</P>
<P>
This anthology will entertain hard-line conservatives, but it fails to present 
the best of American political cartooning.

OUTTAKES: TREAT FOR 'DEAD' HEADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Leonard Klady 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those carnivorous zombies from the 1968 cult classic, "Night of the Living 
Dead," will return to Pittsburgh this fall, when film maker George Romero 
mounts a remake to be financed by Menahem Golan's 21st Century Film Corp. 
Romero has "updated" the script and will produce, but not direct again -- that 
chore now goes to makeup and effects artist Tom Savini. 
</P>
<P>
"The only major change planned is to film in color," Romero told us. He said he 
reluctantly became involved in a remake "to have a hand in maintaining the 
film's integrity." 
</P>
<P>
Another motivator, he admitted: the opportunity to cash in on the film's 
undying popularity, since those most closely involved with the original have 
seen only a fraction of its profits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hardly an uncommon story," Romero added, alluding to widespread 
bootlegging. "There probably isn't a week that goes by that the original isn't 
playing somewhere in the world, and I can tell you that I have no idea who's 
seeing that revenue." Leonard Klady

Romero, meanwhile, joins forces with director Dario Argento to update two 
vintage Edgar Allan Poe tales next month, also in Pittsburgh. Romero's segment, 
"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar," casts Adrienne Barbeau as the wife of 
an insanely jealous man, while Argento reworks "The Black Cat," with a news 
reporter as the feline-phobe. Leonard Klady

OUTTAKES: BACK TO THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Nancy Mills

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When director Brian De Palma was in Thailand last summer making "Casualties of 
War," he picked up Elia Kazan's autobiography one evening and was surprised to 
read about a Kazan film he'd seen 17 years earlier and forgotten -- "The 
Visitors." More surprising: The story of the Kazan movie was the sequel to the 
tale that Palma was then shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"Casualties," due out Aug. 18, is based on a 1969 New Yorker article and later 
a book by Daniel Lang, reporting on the rape and murder of a Vietnamese woman 
by a group of American servicemen, and their subsequent court-martial. Sean 
Penn plays the leader of the rapist-murderers, Michael J. Fox the soldier who 
turns them in. 
</P>
<P>
"Judging from Kazan's biography, he had also read the (New Yorker) piece," De 
Palma told us. "Kazan sat down with his son Chris, who wrote the screenplay, 
and said, 'What would have happened when these guys came out of jail?' " 
</P>
<P>
Kazan shot "The Visitors" on 16-millimeter film and an ultra-low-budget, 
according to trade reports at the time. It was given limited release in 1972 
and got generally negative reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"The Visitors" starred Steve Railsback, Chico Martinez and James Woods in his 
film debut -- the whistle-blower role now being reprised by Fox. Nancy Mills

Is director Paul Bartel ("Scenes From the Class Struggle in Beverly Hills") the 
first casualty of "Casualties of War"? Last week, Bartel was barred from a 
screening of the pic when he showed up at Burbank Studios with a journalist 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nothing personal," stressed a Columbia spokesperson about the incident. 
"But . . . the screening was strictly for long lead press." 
</P>
<P>
Given the boot, Bartel "was walking around the lot, looking for someone to have 
lunch with," he told us, when he ran into an old friend, director Joe Dante. 
Bartel, who is also an actor, ended up clinching a part in Dante's upcoming 
"Gremlins II." 
</P>
<P>
He'll play a theater owner under "Gremlin" attack. His fellow thespian in the 
scene: Steven Spielberg -- playing himself. 
</P>
<P>
About his screening room snub, Bartel told us: "I don't care about petty 
politics -- life's too short." Lance Loud

STAGE WEEK: LOOKING FOR THE REAL ITEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I wanted to show good people driving each other crazy," said Tim Boland, whose 
five-character "Love Mad" opens tonight at the Cast Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The setting is Manhattan. The subject, contemporary relationships. "Everyone is 
starving for correct love in their lives," the playwright said. "A lot of us 
have incorrect love. There's also temporariness in our society, a lack of 
loyalty. In spite of that, you see a great need for people to commit, to stay 
together." 
</P>
<P>
The piece, which is directed by Kent Minault, was originally presented at the 
Bay Area Playwrights Festival -- to a charged response. 
</P>
<P>
"One guy in the lobby said, 'Does he have a tape recorder in our bedrooms?' 
That made me feel good, because it meant I was hitting it on the head. But the 
play also got a lot of people angry. The three male characters speak frankly, 
sometimes chauvinistically. One woman said, 'I don't like these men.' I said, 
'That's the point.' " 
</P>
<P>
Since that staging, Boland has done some rewriting. "I felt I had to deepen it 
with the hurt of the characters," he said. "Their past histories now move them 
in ways that can be self-destructive; they're working on that pain. But the 
most important thing is that people identify with them. They're not amoral 
yuppies into Wall Street greed. They're nice people. They've established their 
priorities in relationships -- and now they're banging heads, struggling to get 
the commitments they need."

THEATER FILE: Mark Harelik's hero will joust with Robin Gammell's devil in

<P>
The Padua Hills Playwrights Workshop/Festival opens its 12th season tomorrow at

July 9. 
</P>
<P>
Strike Theatre's "3 for 1!" (Harry Kondoleon's "The Fairy Garden," Margurite 
MacIntyre's "To Live and Die Like a Cactus" and Nancy Bever's "Attack of the 
Moral Fuzzies") opens Friday at the Callboard, where it will play in rep with 
"The Revengers." 
</P>
<P>
"Free, Adult and Uncensored," a dramatic reading of "A Cast of Thousands," will 
take place at LATC July 10, benefiting the West Coast archives of the WPA 
Federal Theatre Project. Featured are Roscoe Lee Browne, Jeff Corey, Lee Grant, 
Ellen Geer, Burt Lancaster, Burgess Meredith, Joe Spano "and many others." 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSS FIRE: Steve Carter's "Eden" is playing at the Los Angeles 
Theatre Center, with Carl Lumbly reprising his 1980 role as a narrow-minded 
West Indian separationist bullying his family -- and putting the kibosh on his 
daughter's romance with an American black. Ed Cambridge directs. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sylvie Drake in The Times: "If Carter's point is that one can never escape 
the claws of a tyrannical father, (the ending) reduces the play from one that 
would take on significant questions of race and intra-ethnic prejudice to mere 
kitchen-sink drama." 
</P>
<P>
Noted Tom Jacobs in the Daily News: " Eden' is a genuine tragedy. It's an 
old-fashioned, three-act naturalistic play in which the characters explain 
their motivations in magnificent monologues, and the ending manages to feel 
both surprising and inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
From the Herald Examiner's Richard Stayton: "Carter is no August Wilson. The 
garrulous talk and obvious setups rarely soar into mythic territory, as happens 
frequently in Wilson's 'Joe Turner's Come and Gone' or 'Fences.' It's a 
scholarly examination -- period." 
</P>
<P>
In the Reader, Alison Sloane applauded "a complex tale of oppression and 
intraracial separatism, buoyed by a gifted cast and skilled direction . . . 
Much of 'Eden's' power lies in its realism. Carter's richly developed 
characters are fraught with depth, complexity and human fallibility." 
</P>
<P>
The Daily Breeze's Sandra Kreiswirth found the production "beautifully acted 
and technically enhanced by John Iacovelli's multilevel, well-appointed 
functional set; Douglas D. Smith's dim moody lights and Marianna Elliott's 
quietly elegant costumes." 
</P>
<P>
And from Deborah Klugman in Drama-Logue: " 'Eden' is a fine play, tight and 
well-written and full of rich, believable dialogue and complex, intriguing 
characters. Its power is fueled by the performance of Carl Lumbly."

Now that summer is actually upon us, our options are growing. This week, news 
from three of our California boutique festivals: artists and repertory are now 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Barbara, midsummer festivities given by the four-decade old Music 
Academy of the West will attract music-lovers of different stripes to the 
downtown Lobero Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
A six-concert chamber music series will be offered Tuesday nights, July 4-Aug. 
1, featuring the Academy's distinguished faculty -- among them violinists James 
Buswell, Zvi Zeitlin and Stuart Canin; violist Donald McInnes; cellist Stephen 
Kates, and pianists Jerome Lowenthal and Edward Auer -- and students.

Under Lawrence Leighton Smith, the Academy's music director and conductor, the 
Festival Orchestra will give four concerts on Saturday nights, July 15-Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Two operatic productions will be offered this year: Haydn's "L'Infedelta 
Delusa," will be sung July 21 and 22, and Smetana's "Bartered Bride" will be 
given four times, Aug. 12-15. Both works will be sung in English.

Seven concerts in Smothers Theatre at Pepperdine University, Malibu, comprise 
the sixth summer season of the Strawberry Creek Music Festival. Music director 
and festival founder Yehuda Gilad will conduct five of these events, July 
29-Aug. 12. Among the soloists will be violinists Eudice Shapiro and Mark 
Peskanov, and cellist Peter Rejto. The season proper will be preceded by a

BELLS: The centuries-old art of carillon playing will be featured on the fourth 
annual Music by the Tower series at UC Riverside this summer. The five Sunday 
evening concerts, beginning July 2, will offer recitals at the base of the 
university's 161-foot bell tower, followed by performances by visiting 
ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
One of only four cast-bronze bell carillons in California, UC Riverside's 
48-bell system is operated mechanically by a carillonneur. 
</P>
<P>
The bells, which weigh between 28 and 5,091 pounds apiece, are played from a 
cabin just beneath the carillon. The carillonneur uses foot pedals as well as 
his fist to strike the keys. 
</P>
<P>
According to UCR carillonneur David Christensen, cast-bell carillon systems are 
rarely installed because of their size, and their expensive and complex 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't much opportunity to hear mechanical carillon playing in California 
because there are so few," Christensen explained. 
</P>
<P>
"The other cast-bell carillons, in Berkeley and Stanford, are so far away, and 
I don't think UC Santa Barbara has a concert series, so our series is probably 
the only place you can go to see performances in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
Since the first series in 1986, the UCR summer concerts have attracted large 
audiences. Last year, an average of 1,500 people attended each performance. The 
concerts, which are scheduled each Sunday in July at 5:45 p.m., will consist of 
45-minute performances by four different carillonneurs.

BRIEFLY: New in the impresarial field is the New York-based Entertainment 
Corporation. Its birth was announced last week by its parent organization, the 
Entertainment Corp. Limited of London. Charles Dillingham, until recently 
executive director of American Ballet Theatre, is the president and chief 
executive officer of the new producer. . . . Donald Johanos, music director of 
the Honolulu Symphony, will open the new Hong Kong Cultural Center, in 
performances with the Hong Kong Philharmonic, next week. . . . The Andrew W. 
Mellon Foundation has announced a new $600,000 program in support of 
period-instrument orchestras in the United States. The foundation says the aim 
of the program is to "enhance the institutional development of the orchestras, 
particularly their capacity to increase earned and contributed income in their 
communities." Fourteen ongoing orchestras in nine states and the District of 
Columbia have been awarded two-year matching grants to help them "strengthen 
their administration and provide new performance opportunities." Among the 
groups are the Los Angeles Baroque Orchestra, Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra of 
San Francisco, and Banchetto Musicale of Boston.

RECORD RACK: THE END OF INNOCENCE': HENLEY SUMS IT UP AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CHRIS WILLMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
DON HENLEY: "The End of the Innocence." Geffen *** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
Much as the Eagles' "The Long Run" summed up what there was to sum up of the 
1970s a decade ago, Don Henley has returned from a nearly five-year recording 
silence to put a lid on the 1980s with "The End of the Innocence," the third 
post-Eagles album from one of our finest singer/songwriters. In case your 
subscription to Time lapsed while the Shah was sitting pretty, a fair share of 
raw material has accumulated for a civic-minded sort to work with, ethics-wise. 
</P>
<P>
All the topics here are topical enough, and references to Reaganomics, TV 
evangelists, real-estate tycoons and the homeless abound. In the, uh, long run, 
however, the moments that draw you back to the album are those in which Henley 
sticks to such old, timeless standbys as looking for love in all the wrong 
ivory towers. 
</P>
<P>
The best songs here are by and large personal ballads of loss and subsequent 
self-discovery. The title track, a low-key, piano-based collaboration with 
Bruce Hornsby, neatly ties together several of Henley's favored themes -- 
pungent nostalgia for an earlier era in a smaller town, anti-Republican 
politics and sexual release. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintive "The Last Worthless Evening" is the most Eagles-like number, a 
romantic plea to move on from the hurt of old relationships. And "The Heart of 
the Matter," Henley tells us, is forgiveness; like millions of other boomer 
loners, his protagonist has realized, perhaps too late and perhaps not, that 
"the work I put between us doesn't keep me warm." 
</P>
<P>
Henley takes up most of Side 2 with a rocked-up four-song suite of social 
awareness. And though the targets -- greed, politics disguised as religion, 
etc. -- are legitimate, and he gets some terrific zingers, his approach is a 
little too scattershot to do any of these subjects real justice. Henley may be 
one of rock's most eminently quotable moralists, but the ethics he's most 
comfortable exploring are still the ethics of the heart. CHRIS WILLMAN

PETE TOWNSHEND "The Iron Man." Atlantic *** 
</P>
<P>
Who better than Townshend -- rock's most eloquent man/child even as he's 
matured from '60s teen rebel to '80s elder statesman -- to take the voice of an 
adventuring boy in an adaptation of Ted Hughes' Oz-meets-Orpheus children's 
tale? After all, the story deals in Townshend's own essential themes: wonder 
vs. temptation, and submission to confusion vs. submission to comfort. 
</P>
<P>
Townshend is only slightly more slave to the narrative than he was on his own 
notable concept albums, with several of the songs standing among Townshend's 
best. Only the curious, ominous disco-in-hell update of the Arthur Brown's 
"Fire" (one of two tracks reuniting the Who) seems out of place. 
</P>
<P>
But the variety of voices carrying the story proves something of a distraction. 
Even the larger-than-life voice of John Lee Hooker -- perfect casting in the 
title role -- seems forced into the ruminative "Over the Top," though it's 
delightful on the menacing "I Eat Heavy Metal." Townshend's expressive voice 
could have handled all the characters and given a more consistent thread to the 
album. Still, "The Iron Man" is a rich experience for -- as they say -- 
children of all ages. STEVE HOCHMAN

THE ECCENTRIC: CHICAGO'S EVENTFUL, ARTFUL EATERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CHICAGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The brasserie-style awning outside reads "Food Art Reality Hope Life Literature 
Liberte." Inside, there's an English bar, an all-American dance floor, an 
Italianate art gallery-cum-coffeehouse, a brasserielike main dining room, a 
French-flavored cafe. The kitchen, behind glass, is hidden by dark red theatre 
curtains. Oprah Winfrey is seating guests. 
</P>
<P>
You've heard of restaurant as theatre? This is restaurant as multi-media event. 
This is The Eccentric -- Richard Melman's most ambitious production yet. 
</P>
<P>
Melman is Chicago's restaurant whiz kid, the founder and corporate proprietor 
(with his Lettuce Entertain You company) of at least a score of eating places 
of every kind, mostly in or near the Windy City. There's the seminal 
singles-and-salads-bar called R.J. Grunt's (his first restaurant, vintage 
1971), the kicky Ed Debevic's diner chain (Southern California's only direct 
experience with Melman, through the Beverly Hills and Torrance branches), and 
the elegant old-school Pump Room and the top-rated contemporary French-American 
place called Ambria. 
</P>
<P>
Other popular Melman establishments include Avenzare, serving modern/mainstream 
Italian food; Scoozi, Melman's not-entirely-serious interpretation of a rustic 
trattoria; Hatdance, an upscale, imaginative Mexican establishment with 
Japanese (!) accents, and Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba, a tapas emporium. 
</P>
<P>
The Eccentric is a bit harder to characterize -- which is presumably the whole 
point. Eccentricity indeed is rampant. Every corner of the place is fashioned 
in a different style. The very entryway has three personalities: A little 
seating arrangement in the foyer suggests a London men's club; behind it is a 
vitrine filled half with oysters and clams on ice, half with fresh fruit and 
vegetables. "The shellfish is something you'd see in a French brasserie," says 
Melman, "and then right next to it you have something very pure and 
healthy-looking to suggest American food." 
</P>
<P>
The main dining room is big and open and rather old-fashioned looking, but with 
plenty of twists. Every grouping of banquettes is upholstered with different 
fabrics. There are 18 or 19 different kinds of floors, from terrazzo to parquet 
to plain concrete. The room is lit at different points with bare spotlights, 
glass-bead chandeliers and mock candelabra decorated with oak leaves and 
acorns. The walls are crammed with art, most of it by Chicago artists. 
</P>
<P>
Melman has plans for other artists to paint "live" in one corner of the room, 
and may institute poetry readings as well. He has even considered the 
possibility of opening the curtains that hide the kitchen, installing a 
microphone, and letting the chef address diners periodically. Meanwhile, he 
says, "I hope there'll be dancing in the aisles sometimes." A sign on a pillar 
reads, "Stay Real/Never Dull/No Rules". 
</P>
<P>
The Eccentric is like an anti-theme theme restaurant. "If this place were a 
movie," says Melman, "it would be called 'A Club for Eccentrics Meets the Great 
American Bistro.' " 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, both "bistro" and "American" are appropriate terms for the food here. 
Old-fashioned escargots bourguignonne, French onion soup and roasted chicken 
with thyme share menu space with Caesar salad, a Cheddar-cheeseburger on a 
walnut bun, grilled swordfish and chocolate-banana creme brulee. The pate is 
made of chicken livers; the crab meat gratin is served with toast points. 
</P>
<P>
Melman's chef at The Eccentric is the talented Michael Kornick, who cooked at 
the Quilted Giraffe in New York and then at Gordon's and at Melman's Pump Room 
in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
In developing a menu, though, Melman had the help of at least a dozen other 
chefs -- he is very much a believer in the collaborative process and in 
teamwork -- among them, such former Los Angeles residents as Tim Cushman (of 
Trumps and the late 385 North), Octavio Bessera and Fred Eric (original chefs 
at the Flaming Colossus club and longtime associates of Joachim Splichal at the 
Regency Club and the short-lived Max au Triangle), and Susan Regis and Leslie 
Mackie (for some years members of Lydia Shire's kitchen team at L.A.'s Four 
Seasons Hotel and Langan's Brasserie, among other places). 
</P>
<P>
Not everything this high-powered crew came up with is equally successful, it 
must be said -- or at least it wasn't during The Eccentric's first weeks of 
life. A spicy fish hash with cucumber relish, for instance, was mushy and mild 
one evening (in marked contrast to the superb, not dissimilar crab meat hash 
served on the breakfast menu at the 21 East Hotel). 
</P>
<P>
A dish dubbed "raviolio Ocfredio" (after the aforementioned Octavio and Fred) 
-- toasted cheese ravioli in a light tomato sauce -- was resolutely ordinary; 
roast duck with red cabbage was dry and bland. On the other hand, there was a 
perfectly simple roasted artichoke with pungent "garlic aioli" (is there any 
other kind?); a lovely salad of curly endive, bacon and Roquefort in sherry 
vinaigrette; and a delicious paillard of beef with Cabernet sauce -- though the 
fried leeks promised with it by the menu (presumably an inspiration from chef 
Cushman's months with fried-leek specialist Jose Lampreia at the trendy Maison 
Blanche in Paris) were not available, and have reportedly been permanently 
86'd. 
</P>
<P>
The aforementioned cheeseburger was terrific. So was a side order of the 
so-called Oprah's potatoes, mashed with a hint of horseradish -- a recipe from 
you-know-who. Oprah Winfrey is a partner in the restaurant, in fact, and she 
really does come in and seat people sometimes. She also, says Melman, takes 
part in creative meetings -- and was observed, shortly before the restaurant 
opened, peeling and mashing her own potatoes, trying to get that recipe just 
right. 
</P>
<P>
If The Eccentric sounds like a hard act to follow, well, Melman already has 
something else lined up. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be a place called Bub's," he says, "though that name might change. It'll 
be a hillbilly restaurant with a carwash attached -- a dine 'n' shine type of 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eccentric, 159 West Erie Street, Chicago. (312) 787-8390. AE, MC, VISA. 
Dinner for two (food only): $25-65.

Suzanne Muchnic's June 11 article on the art-buying frenzy prompted me to write 
the following -- to be sung to the tune of "Love and Marriage": 
</P>

 Art and money / Art and money / Go together like the bees and honey / Like the 
Dow-Jones brothers / You can't have one / You can't have one / You can't have

<P>
One reason some contemporary paintings sell for millions of dollars is that 
most of the world's true art is not floating around in pricey auction galleries 
but rather is permanently hung in the great museums. It is literally priceless, 
is not for sale, and can't be purchased at any price. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, so-called New York intellectuals "with a little money" are forced 
to bid on whatever is leftover -- that leaves contemporary art, which is a dime 
a dozen. Its price can easily be manipulated by creative marketing, auction 
scheduling, gallery showings, art dealers, etc. 
</P>
<P>
As I recall, toward the end of his life, Spanish contemporary "artist" Jean 
Miro was turning out six or seven pictures every day. How much thought or 
talent goes into one of those million-dollar "works"?

To set the record straight: The "halcyon days" of Roller Derby (to use the 
quotation that Meyers attributed to Bill Griffiths) occurred when Griffiths was 
50% partner in Roller Derby with Jerry Hill, from 1962 to 1971. Griffiths and 
Hill were both responsible for the success of Roller Derby, along with many 
other talented people. 
</P>
<P>
To imply that Bill Griffiths was singularly responsible for rebuilding Roller 
Derby into a business success that eventually led to RollerGames is both 
inaccurate and unfair to Jerry Hill, my father.

My late father, Leo Seltzer, who created Roller Derby in 1935, did not go out 
of business in 1960 as Bill Griffiths was quoted as saying. Rather, I started 
promoting in the San Francisco Bay Area in 1960 and eventually syndicated 
Roller Derby to 120 TV stations. 
</P>
<P>
Our league did not perform in "musty arenas," as Meyers writes, but rather 
Madison Square Garden, the St. Louis Arena, the Oakland Coliseum and others. 
For an untarnished history of the game, see Frank Deford's book, "Five Strides 
on the Banked Track." 
</P>
<P>
I am sorry that the producers of the coming "RollerGames" television series are 
not attempting to present the real game with skilled and professional 
competitors -- apparently fostering instead a "wrestling on wheels" approach.

It seems to me that Okamoto would tap the minority resource, especially 
Japanese-Americans already in the film business in Hollywood. White Hollywood 
has ignored the masses of minority talent here.

Okamoto is a godsend for Asians, blacks, Native Americans and Mexican-Americans 
who've been standing in the wings.

PROJECTION QUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some thoughts prompted by Kenneth Bank's June 11 letter, in which he complained 
about an out-of-focus movie and theorized that no projectionist was available 
to fix the problem: 
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, one mid-range and two large U.S. theater chains locked out 
their professional projectionists. Now fully half of the first-run theaters use 
tag teams of overworked managers and assistants to deliver their shows. 
</P>
<P>
In past "negotiations," one of these companies cynically pointed to increased 
popcorn sales when their customers wait out mid-show interruptions. And it 
boasted that sloppy performances hadn't hurt its grosses. 
</P>
<P>
Projection systems are at best semiautomated. They still need lots of care. 
</P>
<P>
Do you want a professional show for the price of your ticket? Then stay away 
from theaters whose greed sells the show short.

die. They tell of disembodied travels through dark tunnels at immeasurable 
speeds, of being bathed in a brilliant light that conveys feelings of peace and 
love, of seeing the minutiae of their lives replayed. Are these hallucinations, 
induced by drugs or anesthesia? Perhaps, but most people who survive the 
near-death experience are never the same. 
</P>
<P>
 It might have been a side effect of painkillers that changed Steve Price's 
life. It might have been a surge of natural energy that some mystics believe 
lies in reserve in us all. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, it may have been evolution. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever it was that kept Price from firing his gun ever again after he was 
nearly killed by a mortar fragment in Vietnam in 1965 has never been measured 
or analyzed or scanned. No one knows, so any theory could be applied. 
</P>
<P>
Years later, Price's near-death experience continues to shape his life, and the 
same is true for many of the 8 million Americans who claim to know how it feels 
to die. 
</P>
<P>
Nine years after her own brush with death, Barbara Harris walked away from her 
husband and three children. She couldn't reconcile her privileged life style 
with a desire to help others that was kindled when her life flashed before her, 
revealing each ripple that her actions had caused in the lives of others. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similarity of Accounts 
</P>
<P>
Just as many people can't remember their dreams, the majority of people who 
have come close to death don't recall it. But the 25% to 30% of those who do 
remember give similar descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
They tell of disembodied travels through dark tunnels at immeasurable speeds, 
of being bathed in a brilliant white or golden light that conveys feelings of 
peace and love far beyond any earthly emotion, of seeing the minutiae of their 
lives replayed for their edification. 
</P>
<P>
Some report joyful reunions with deceased loved ones who communicate 
telepathically. Others tell of a divine presence, or energy force, which they 
describe as the source of all love. They recall comprehending, for a 
mind-reeling instant, the secrets of the universe, and of the anguish and 
sorrow they feel when they reluctantly rejoin the living. 
</P>
<P>
These descriptions are similar among other nationalities, with cultural 
variations. A Buddhist won't see Jesus, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Psychoanalyst Karl Jung wrote of having a near-death experience in the 
mid-1940s. English philosopher Sir Alfred J. Ayer, one of the world's prominent 
atheists, had one just last year. (Ayer wrote: "It slightly weakened my 
conviction that my genuine death, which is due fairly soon, will be the end of 
me, though I continue to hope that it will be.") 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fear of Death Banished 
</P>
<P>
No scientist who studies such experiences has been lucky enough to be around 
during one, so they can only chronicle the survivors' accounts. The people 
invariably say they have lost all fear of death. Many feel angry and 
disappointed at being revived. "I felt so restricted, so trapped in this body," 
said Al Sullivan of East Hartford, whose close call came during his heart 
surgery last year. 
</P>
<P>
Those who were attempting suicide at the time seldom try it again. "The things 
that made people suicidal before are no longer meaningful," said Bruce Greyson, 
a psychiatry professor at the University of Connecticut Medical Center who has 
interviewed thousands of subjects over 15 years of study. "People see their 
role in the universe-at-large. They see why they're here -- to take care of a 
family, raise a child, write a book." 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all of them are left with an unwavering belief in a higher power, 
regardless of prior convictions. But, at the same time, organized religion 
tends to lose relevance. 
</P>
<P>
"The God I met loves everyone. It's generic," Kate Valentine of Oxford, Conn., 
said. She was a Roman Catholic before her 1981 brush with death, but said she 
has "become very unreligious." 
</P>
<P>
Many go on to lead less materialistic lives, and many change careers. Often 
they become nurses or social workers, or volunteer for community service. 
</P>
<P>
"If a person was very materialistic before, his whole life may be disrupted," 
Greyson said. "Relationships often break up, especially if they were based on 
materialism and power. For a successful businessman that could mean not being 
able to return to the job." 
</P>
<P>
Kenneth Ring, a professor of psychology at the University of Connecticut at 
Storrs, has studied near-death phenomena since 1976 and has written two books 
on the subject. "People become life-appreciators," he said. "They don't care 
about success, fame or fortune. They want to sail their boats on Long Island 
Sound." 
</P>
<P>
They often develop a deep hunger for spiritual understanding, along with a 
fervent desire to see conditions in the world improve. They tend to become more 
self-confident and less passive. Often, they like themselves better. 
</P>
<P>
"I do miss financial security, but what really matters is love," said Harris, 
46. After she had back surgery in 1975, complications set in, her condition 
deteriorated and she passed out in her bed. 
</P>
<P>
She came to in the hospital corridor. 
</P>
<P>
"I turned to go back into my room -- my first thought was that I'd get in 
trouble for being out of bed. Then I discovered I was looking directly into a 
speaker that was mounted on the ceiling." 
</P>
<P>
Confusion (If I'm here, who's in the bed?) soon gave way to pure sensation. "I 
felt my grandmother holding me, cradling me." The feeling was so soothing, so 
familiar, that moments passed before Harris remembered that her grandmother had 
been dead for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
She returned to her body, but a week later, still bedridden, she had a vision. 
"I drew out of my body and relived my life -- all 32 years -- in an instant. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard myself saying, 'No wonder! No wonder you are the way you are!' I felt 
all the slates being wiped clean. I understood the reasons behind everything 
that had ever happened to me. It was the most healing therapy there could be." 
</P>
<P>
The Barbara Harris who entered the hospital had filled her days with garden 
club meetings. The one who left felt drawn to hospital emergency rooms. She 
became a hospital volunteer, then a respiratory and massage therapist. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Harris packed her clothes and her stereo into her Saab and drove 
away from her home, back-yard pool and private plane. Now she rents a tiny 
apartment in Newington, which she shares with two of her children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Volunteer Worker 
</P>
<P>
She speaks to nurses, clergy and others who counsel the dying, and does 
volunteer work as Greyson's research assistant. She also leads monthly meetings 
of one of the two dozen near-death survivors' support groups that have sprung 
up around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The need for such support is enormous, Harris said. "You can't stay the way you 
are, and your loved ones don't want you to change." 
</P>
<P>
Many medical professionals dismiss the near-death experience as a hallucinatory 
side effect of drugs or anesthesia. Others attribute them to lack of oxygen to 
the brain or to the release of some stress-related chemical in the body. 
</P>
<P>
"Death is a state; dying is a process," said Richard Blacher, a psychiatry 
professor at Tufts University and the New England Medical Center Hospital. He 
favors the anesthesia explanation and says those who claim to have died and 
returned to life are making an error in logic. 
</P>
<P>
"Driving to New York City is not the same as New York City," he said. "You're 
not going to get a taste of New York by driving there." 
</P>
<P>
As the arguments continue, improved resuscitation techniques and medical 
procedures are making close calls with death increasingly common. A 1982 Gallup 
Poll found that 8 million adult Americans had had near-death experiences, and 
also called that a conservative estimate. As their number grows, so does the 
conviction among a handful of scientists that the phenomenon warrants serious 
study. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tremendous Impact 
</P>
<P>
"Our understanding of death has a tremendous impact on how we treat people who 
are dealing with death, people who are suicidal, people who are facing their 
own deaths or grieving for loved ones," said Greyson, who is research director 
of the 700-member, nonprofit International Assn. of Near-Death Studies, which 
disseminates information, sponsors studies and provides support services. 
</P>
<P>
Although they do not prove that there is an afterlife, the experiences are 
powerful catalysts to change, said Greyson, who has interviewed thousands of 
subjects. One, a former Mafia hit man, now counsels wife beaters in Ohio. A 
college professor quit his job to hitchhike across the United States. A laborer 
with a high school education immersed himself in quantum physics after waking 
up one night and blurting out the word quantum. (Neither he nor his wife knew 
what it meant.) 
</P>
<P>
Just as radical as some of the life style transformations are the hypotheses 
that are offered to explain them. 
</P>
<P>
Kundalini, Sanskrit for coiled up, refers to a subtle biological force said to 
lie dormant at the base of the spine. When it is activated, the energy travels 
through body channels, or chakras, to unleash physical and psychological 
fireworks. Kundalini theorists believe such awakenings can catapult individuals 
into states of higher consciousness similar to those described by near-death 
survivors, and with equally profound effects. 
</P>
<P>
Kundalini awakenings, achieved through spiritual disciplines such as yoga and 
meditation, can cause transformations virtually indistinguishable from those 
that follow near-death experiences. The fact that such parallels exist doesn't 
prove a common cause, Ring said, but "it does at least suggest the possibility 
that there may be a general biological process that underlies them both." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Theory of Evolution 
</P>
<P>
If so, the seeming profusion of near-death experiences in recent years could be 
demonstrating an evolutionary mechanism designed to propel all of humanity 
toward a higher consciousness, some scientists have suggested. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the cause, there is no denying the effect, Ring said. "The person you 
become is really different. The person you were is lost." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Price of Killingworth, Conn., was nearly killed when a mortar fragment 
pierced his lung in Vietnam. Once a schoolyard bully, he said: "I've become so 
sensitive that when other people hurt I can feel it. I talk to people about 
metaphysical things. Before, I would've made fun of them." 
</P>
<P>
A burly man whose forearms are mapped with tattoos, Price still gets tearful 
when he recalls the summer night he relived his life in an instant while 
waiting for a medic to reach him. Three days later, the wounded Marine was 
wheeled into surgery at a field hospital, but his conscious mind took a detour 
and wound up on the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
"A white light encompassed me. It took me in. I felt such warmth and peace . . 
. . I didn't say the word God for a long time, but now I can say that the light 
was God. It was like the most loving mother embracing her infant, only a 
million times more than that." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unable to Fight 
</P>
<P>
Price recovered and returned to the war. "I led my unit. I did all the things I 
was supposed to, but I never shot my gun. All I ever wanted was to be a Marine, 
but I realized I couldn't do my job." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he joined the National Guard "because it helps people instead of going 
to war." 
</P>
<P>
"Before . . . I was afraid to die, even though I was in the business of 
killing," he said. "I was so afraid to die that I couldn't live." 
</P>
<P>
These survivors describe more than a spiritual transformation. They also talk 
of physical changes, which Greyson and Ring are trying to measure. 
</P>
<P>
"People often report that their vital signs change -- their respiratory rates, 
their heart rates," Greyson said. "Beyond that, very great changes are reported 
in the ways they metabolize food and drugs -- in heightened sensitivities to 
light, sounds, smells, tastes. Some can't tolerate perfume. Some can't drink 
alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
Kate Valentine, a mother of three from Long Island, resigned herself to dying 
when she developed a lung infection, circulation problems and an irregular 
heartbeat after surgery for thyroid cancer in 1981. "After being sick for a 
long time, you become physically and emotionally whipped," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Healing Visit 
</P>
<P>
One night, after putting her affairs in order, Valentine fell asleep in her bed 
and found herself at the edge of a valley. "The colors were incredible, as if 
all my life I'd been looking at the wrong side of a tapestry, then suddenly 
turned it over." 
</P>
<P>
She saw no one, but felt a loving, peaceful presence beside her. "I wanted to 
go into the valley, but was told, telepathically, 'No.' " The next morning she 
awoke free of pain. "My heart wasn't skipping beats or pounding or anything. My 
hands were normal -- they had been almost black." 
</P>
<P>
The "new" Kate Valentine directs a senior citizens' center and tries to help 
troubled souls who cross her path with baffling regularity. "I could go on and 
on about the house cleaners who never cleaned, the plumbers who never plumbed. 
People on the brink of death, bereavement, tragedy, somehow find their way to 
my door." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Valentine, a general contractor, accompanies his wife to Harris' support 
meetings and volunteers with her at a local soup kitchen. They agree that 
Kate's experience strengthened their marriage. 
</P>
<P>

For a long time, she said, she told no one, not even her husband, about the 
experience that prompted her to change her ways. "Then a friend of mine died of 
cancer. Suddenly, I needed to know why I lived and she died." No longer able to 
deny her experience, Valentine began trying to understand it. 
</P>
<P>
She's still working on it, as are Steve Price, Barbara Harris and countless 
others whose celestial wanderings took place in the blink of an eye, but whose 
struggle to resume the earthly existence may go on as long as they live. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 25 years after he almost died, Steve Price said, he is finally beginning 
to live.

"I've taken a long look at myself. I'm just now seeing somebody in there who's 
worth saving."

GRASS-ROOTS PRIVATE TRUSTS FILL GAP IN WILDERNESS PRESERVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Preserving the wilderness once was left largely to the government. Now, private 
trusts are buying up land across the country in an effort to save the unplowed, 
the undrained and the undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
That much is obvious on the northern border of Michigan, on a spur of land that 
locals call the beginning of the world and tourists say is the end. 
</P>
<P>
Free-lance naturalist Jim Rooks, trudging deep into the stand of towering 
Estivant pines on a recent day, suddenly stopped and pointed with the 
exuberance of a child. "There!" 
</P>
<P>
He almost toppled over as he arched back to gaze up at the giant before him. It 
is a Gargantuan white pine, 300 or more years old. 
</P>
<P>
Then Rooks pointed out 19 wide table tops of cut stumps, now turned black. He 
had come upon them in June, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, my God, my heart," Rooks said, recalling the warm, sickening day with its 
buzz of saws. "Every tree was a drop of blood." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Extensive Stand 
</P>
<P>
Rooks and other Michigan environmentalists say that these giant pine trees of 
the Keweenaw Peninsula by Lake Superior are the largest, most extensive stand 
of unprotected white pine in the eastern United States. 
</P>
<P>
The logging company that owns the land is ready to harvest the trees, but, for 
varied reasons, neither the U.S. Forest Service nor the Michigan Department of 
Natural Resources has tried to save the stand. The federal government is 
concentrating on filling in gaps in existing national forests while the state 
never has formally considered saving the pines, officials with both agencies 
say. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the battle for the Estivant pines, named for the French merchant who 
bought much of the local land in 1857, has fallen into private hands, paid for 
by anonymous donors, blue-collar philanthropists and grade-school students. 
</P>
<P>
It is, conservationists say, typical of new preservation efforts throughout the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
"If the job is going to get done, we're going to have to roll up our own 
sleeves and do it as private citizens," said Russell van Herik, vice president 
for the national Nature Conservancy's Midwest region in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nature Conservancy 
</P>
<P>
The Nature Conservancy is one of a growing number of private land trusts that 
are buying up land and protecting endangered species as quickly as donations to 
cover the purchases come in. 
</P>
<P>
A survey by the national Land Trust Exchange, a coordinating body in 
Alexandria, Va., turned up 743 nonprofit land trusts across the United States 
last year, up from 535 only three years earlier. Half of them have no staffs 
and less than $10,000 a year to spend. Together their memberships amount to 
640,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
They range from the newly formed Kachemak Bay Heritage Land Trust in 
wilderness-rich Homer, Alaska, to the 98-year-old Trustees of Reservations in 
crowded Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an amazingly rapid-growing movement," said Jean Hocker, executive 
director of the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"What's happened is a sense of real dismay of what's happening in communities 
-- a feeling that the people who live there have to take care of it," Hocker 
said. "As development pressures increase on the land, people are realizing that 
protection of open land is the responsibility of all of us." 
</P>
<P>
Although private trusts also guard land for scenic views and playgrounds, the 
strongest interest is in preserving ecologically important areas, Hocker said. 
Some trusts manage the sanctuaries on their own, while others turn them over to 
government agencies for public parks and forests. 
</P>
<P>
Van Herik said the Nature Conservancy considers itself "the Noah's ark of this 
country." The national trust, which centers its efforts on endangered species 
and ecologies, has set aside 3.5 million acres of land, including 396 preserves 
in 12 Midwestern states. 
</P>
<P>
Despite their growth, private land trusts will not replace government land 
programs, a U.S. Forest Service official said. "To us, they are complimentary," 
said Harold Bolt, acting regional land director for the Forest Service in 
Milwaukee, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
The Forest Service has budgeted $2 million this year to buy land within 
national forests in Ohio and Illinois. It plans to spend more than $20 million 
for the entire Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government Slower to Act 
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to land outside the national forests, it takes an average of 
10 years to identify, study, propose, debate and designate land for federal 
acquisition, said Jane Elder, head of the Sierra Club's Midwest offices in 
Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
"Land trusts can move more quickly, less expensively, and sometimes people will 
consider selling to private individuals when they won't even talk to the 
federal government," Hocker said. 
</P>
<P>
And, Elder added, there is the worry that public designation as a wilderness 
area is a kiss of death to the virginity of land surrounded by population 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of fear in the Midwest that once land is designated, it will get 
loved to death," by backpackers, trail bikes and others using it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Land trusts have cropped up in Arizona, Wyoming and New Mexico, but they remain 
concentrated in the East and Midwest, where there is much development and 
little in the way of federal wilderness areas. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio has only 77 acres of federally protected wilderness, Elder said. Iowa has 
none. 
</P>
<P>
In these areas, private trusts are finding their land in small packages, 
nestled among cornfields and smokestacks. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't look like Yellowstone and it doesn't look like Yosemite," Elder 
said. "But you can find quiet and solitude and virgin white pine. And you can 
even get lost." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unspectacular Vistas 
</P>
<P>
It takes a sophisticated citizenry to donate money for the seemingly 
unspectacular: Michigan's buggy swamps, Illinois' hilltop prairies and Iowa's 
freakish cool air slopes, where snails from the Ice Age dwell. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, the idea of an important natural area was something that made 
you say 'Oh!' It had to be 1,000 feet high and there had to be waterfalls," Van 
Herik said. 
</P>
<P>
Rooks didn't gamble on such sophistication in 1971 when the Estivant pines 
first were timbered. He told corporate landowners that their loggers were 
felling the oldest trees in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
"They could have been. Nobody knew," Rooks admits now. 
</P>
<P>
Either way, the logging stopped long enough for the Michigan Nature Assn. to 
buy 200 acres for $42,145. The next 80 acres cost $100,000 this May and the 
association is negotiating for another 97 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Rooks discovered among the pines the Leaning Giant, a tilted monolith of 
a white pine that won Michigan Botanical Society and national honors as the 
second-largest white pine in the East before teetering to the ground in 
October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The Michigan Nature Assn. since has learned the hard way that its remote island 
of trees is as vulnerable as the timber forest surrounding it. A logger 
wandered into the Estivant pines two years ago, felling giant after giant, 
before he realized that he was in the wrong place. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Lake Superior Land Co. says it will return to timber the rest of the 
virgin forest. It's either buy or cut, said Gary Willis, a commercial forester 
and a volunteer for the association. 
</P>
<P>
"Economically speaking, the stand should be cut," Willis said. But, "simply 
put, we'll never see it again, in our lifetimes, anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Preservation versus development isn't the issue, said Lake Superior Land Co. 
President Bob Grasseschi. 
</P>
<P>
"It's simply economics. The stand is mature. It's a natural resource like any 
that should be used in a responsible way," Grasseschi said. "It's just a 
question of paying for that resource."

Iran should be governed by a three-member advisory board chaired by the late 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's son, Ahmed, an editorial in a government-run 
newspaper said. The governing board should also include President Ali Khamenei 
and Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, the English-language Tehran Times 
said. It said Khomeini should be chairman because he was closest to his father 
and thus familiar with his thinking. Khamenei was named as Iran's supreme 
leader a day after Khomeini died June 3.

ETHICS ISSUES STAND OUT IN RELIEF AS GENE MAPPING ADVANCES 
</P>

<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Science fiction has long been filled with chilling scenarios of the future in 
which evil leaders try to engineer a master race of genetically perfect human 
beings. 
</P>
<P>
The tools to accomplish such a feat are slowly moving out of the realm of 
fiction, however, as geneticists around the world struggle to identify and 
decode all of the genes contained in the human body. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time they must struggle with the ethical questions that have always 
surrounded the science of genetics, but their efforts in that area may be moot. 
Scientists at a recent conference on gene mapping frequently pointed out that, 
once they determine how a human being is made, they will have little control 
over how their discoveries are used. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make people literate about genetic knowledge . . . there is no 
doubt that this knowledge would be very useful," said Dr. James Watson, the 
Nobel laureate who with Francis Crick discovered the structure of DNA, the 
basic building block of cells. 
</P>
<P>
But Watson told the Yale University conference that, although he is "genuinely 
concerned" about how that knowledge is applied, "we cannot make policy . . . 
all we can do is educate." 
</P>
<P>
Gene mapping is one of the hottest areas of science now, and a unique 
international effort has been undertaken to locate and define all of the 
chemical instructions that create a human being, collectively known as the 
human genome. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers are working to map the position of each of the 100,000 or so genes 
contained on the body's 46 chromosomes. They must then determine the sequence 
of a four-letter code contained on the DNA of each gene, known as the genetic 
code. 
</P>
<P>
This code controls everything from hair color to some aspects of personality 
and consists of about 3.5 billion characters for the entire genome. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nearly 2,000 Genes Mapped 
</P>
<P>
So far researchers have mapped just under 2,000 genes. They do not expect to 
complete the arduous process for another 15 to 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has announced plans to invest more than $3 billion over the 
next 15 years in the National Institutes of Health's gene-mapping project, 
making it the largest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
France also has a well-advanced gene-mapping program. The European Community 
plans to invest $20 million over the next two years on a genome project. And 
Japan, the Soviet Union, Italy and Canada have announced plans for national 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very clear that the human genome initiative has captured the imagination 
of the world," said Norton Zinder, chairman of the advisory committee to the 
NIH's human genome program. 
</P>
<P>
The world, however, is not interested merely for the sake of improving 
knowledge. Researchers expect that once the genome is defined, medical science 
can apply the findings to the diagnosis and cure of more than 4,000 human 
diseases known to stem from gene defects. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors could predict an individual's, or even a fetus's, susceptibility to 
everything from Alzheimer's disease to cancer, and could possibly alter 
biological instructions to eliminate genetic defects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issues Raised 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, gene mapping raises a host of social and ethical issues, such as 
rights to privacy raised by genetic testing, the prospects of more abortions to 
eliminate the "genetically unfit" and whether gene therapy should move from the 
treatment of a disease to the alteration of a person's genetic makeup to 
eliminate the possibility of disease. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the 700 scientists who attended the Yale conference were obviously 
concerned about ethics but also confused as to how much they should be involved 
in issues generally decided outside the laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Victor McKusick, director of an international group called the Human Genome 
Organization (HUGO) that is trying to coordinate gene-mapping research 
worldwide, said that scientists may think they have no place in setting social 
policy, but in this area "we have to take (ethics) seriously." 
</P>
<P>
"The truth is we are going to have genetic information," he said. "We must make 
decisions on how it will be used." 
</P>
<P>
The NIH, under the auspices of Watson and Zinder, have set up a working group 
on ethical issues connected to the genome project led by Nancy Wexler, an 
associate professor of clinical neuropsychology at Columbia University and 
president of the Hereditary Disease Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The project also plans to spend 3% to 5% of its annual budget, up to $5 
million, on ethical concerns and public education. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposition to Mapping 
</P>
<P>
But gene mapping is already running into opposition. Jeremy Rifkin, president 
of the Foundation on Economic Trends and an outspoken opponent of genetic 
engineering, has organized a coalition of 70 consumer representatives including 
Ralph Nader and National Organization for Women President Molly Yard to lobby 
for the creation of a permanent congressional board to "address the issues of 
genetic discrimination, privacy and eugenics caused by the human gene-mapping 
project." 
</P>
<P>
In West Germany, the environmentally focused Greens Party is strongly opposed 
to the genome project, claiming that the research could lead to human eugenic 
experiments similar to those carried out by the Nazi regime. 
</P>
<P>
However, scientists note that the regulations imposed by individual countries 
may be meaningless for a project that is so international in scope. 
</P>
<P>
Zinder said the NIH group has been approached by several Third World nations 
interested in sharing research efforts and results. "I don't know that we can 
do anything about how they will use it," he said. "We can only provide the 
information."

<P>
Only two months after he had left for Vietnam in August, 1968, Jose Antonio 
Graniela was shot during a confrontation with the Viet Cong. His family learned 
he was missing in action. 
</P>
<P>
Months later, the Brentwood, N.Y., family was told that Jose, 24, had died in 
the arms of a comrade they knew only as Gary. 
</P>
<P>
His body could not be found, the family was told. Nor could officials find any 
of his belongings. Even the picture of his fiancee, the one he always carried 
with him, was gone. 
</P>
<P>
The Granielas wanted to find Gary, and to find out the details of Jose's death. 
But they were never given Gary's last name. 
</P>
<P>
"This boy disappeared from the face of the Earth, and we get nothing," said 
Maria Figalora, Jose's sister, in a recent telephone interview. "Three months 
later, they come up with this story." 
</P>
<P>
For more than 20 years, the Graniela family has lived life through a prism of 
Jose's death. They agonize over what might have happened to him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Can't Forget' 
</P>
<P>
"They (the U.S. government) want to forget, but we can't forget," Figalora 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For hundreds of families across America, whose primary clue to the soldier who 
never came home is the name on a list of U.S. unaccounted for in Southeast 
Asia, the truth about their fate remains unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless a case is actually resolved, family members never really get it 
completely out of their minds," said George Brooks, chairman of the National 
League of Families of American Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia. "It's a 
relief finally knowing." 
</P>
<P>
Three days after his 21st birthday, Sgt. Joseph A. Matejov of East Meadow, 
N.Y., was flying his last reconnaissance flight, working electronic equipment 
over the Laos border on Feb. 5, 1973 -- eight days after the Paris peace 
accords were signed and the conflict in Southeast Asia ended. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Matejov and her husband, Stephen, a retired Army lieutenant colonel now 
deceased, then believed without a doubt the Air Force account that her son 
Joseph's plane was hit by enemy gunfire. They had a military memorial ceremony 
in Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly six years, the Matejovs mourned the loss of their son, the third of 
10 children, until one morning they heard a television show about a Laotian 
transmission that indicated that four men in her son's plane were captured and 
not killed. The Matejovs were later told by a government official that one of 
the four was believed to be her son. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agonizing Search 
</P>
<P>
What followed continues as an agonizing search for the truth. "I know that my 
son was captured. My son is definitely a prisoner," said Mary Matejov, who is 
an outspoken activist on the POW-MIA issue. "Tell me the truth about my son, 
and bring him back, but don't abandon him." 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the war ended, the Vietnamese have periodically offered the United 
States remains that they claim are of American servicemen. Military officials 
and veterans' groups said that cooperation between the two countries improved 
dramatically after former President Ronald Reagan sent Gen. John Vessey to 
Vietnam in August, 1987. More than 50 Americans in nine different shipments of 
remains have been identified since then, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Families "are getting more optimistic because we are getting an increased 
number of remains back," Brooks said. "There is no question there were some men 
alive who did not come back in spite of our efforts to get information from the 
Vietnamese and Laotian governments." 
</P>
<P>
But Matejov and other advocates argue that it is the U.S. government that has 
not done enough to obtain the release of those who they believe are alive and 
still being held prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
"People were burying bones that were not their loved ones," said Danny DeMauro, 
a Vietnam combat veteran and president of the Freedom Foundation, a nonprofit 
organization based in Oakdale, N.Y., that seeks to promote awareness on the 
POW-MIA cause. "The U.S. is trying to close the book because of political 
mistakes" on prisoners of war. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tooth in a Coffin' 
</P>
<P>
"So many families are receiving one tooth in a coffin, and that doesn't prove 
that the man is dead," Mary Matejov said. "Some families are getting pieces of 
bones that in no way can be identified. 
</P>
<P>
"I want people to be aware that there are live men over there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Lt. Cmdr. John Kudla, a Pentagon spokesman, said that the government "has 
been unable to prove that any of the 2,357 persons missing from the Vietnam war 
are still alive." 
</P>
<P>
The government has received reports of almost 1,200 "sightings" of U.S. 
servicemen in Southeast Asia, but all but 140 were mistaken identities, people 
later identified as dead or "suspected fabrications," Kudla said. The 
government is continuing to pursue the 140 cases but has no proof they actually 
are U.S. servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Mary Matejov and other POW-MIA activists understand that families just 
do not want to open old wounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't heard anything. There is always hope that they are going to find 
the remains, said Ann Famigliette, niece of MIA William Colwell. Colwell, of 
Glen Cove, N.Y., was reported missing on Christmas Eve, 1965. "We always live 
in constant hope. There's no anger (toward the U.S. government). It's just a 
very hard situation." 
</P>
<P>
Lucy Caliendo, the sister of Paul Andrew Avolese of East Meadow, N.Y., who was 
a major in the Air Force, said that she has accepted the idea that her brother 
is probably dead. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been 22 years, so we have to take it as it is," she said. Caliendo said 
Avolese died when a plane he was flying crashed. "We have wondered, but after 
all this time, you give up hope."

SON COMING HOME AT LAST -- TO BE BURIED

<TEXT>
<P>
For 17 years, John and Eugenia Bednarek were torn by the uncertainty of whether 
their only son was alive. 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty drove them from the house in Greenlawn, N.Y., where they reared 
Jonathan and his sister Joanne. It consumed their attention. And, despite 
continuing evidence to the contrary, they held out the hope that someday 
Jonathan would join them at the condominium where they now live in Ridge, N.Y. 
-- to once again wear his clothes that they stored in the extra bedroom, to 
once again pick up the belongings stowed in his trunk. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, three people have been living in this condo, because we never knew, 
one of these days he might be back," John Bednarek said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Bednarek is now coming home, not to live, but to be buried. And John 
and Eugenia Bednarek finally have the answer they have been seeking for 17 
years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Killed in 1972 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Jonathan Bruce Bednarek was killed in a 1972 bombing mission over North 
Vietnam, where his remains stayed until they were returned to the United States 
late last year. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, military officials became convinced that Jonathan 
Bednarek's remains were among 38 sets of remains -- 16 tentatively identified 
as those of American servicemen -- handed over to the U.S. government in 
December, his father said. The Bednareks were told shortly afterward that the 
process to identify their son's remains had begun. 
</P>
<P>
"All these years we didn't know what to grieve for, because we didn't know if 
he was dead or alive," said John Bednarek, who is 78. "Let me tell you, it 
shook us up. At last we knew, but it wasn't the news we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the officials told the Bednareks that the identification process was 
almost complete. They said that the family could arrange funeral services for 
their son, one of 29 Long Islanders listed as unaccounted for after military 
action in Southeast Asia, and the first whose remains have been identified and 
sent home to Long Island for burial since the war ended. 
</P>
<P>
An honors high school student in Greenlawn who graduated magna cum laude with 
an ROTC commission at Manhattan College, Bednarek had served just one month and 
one day as an Air Force captain when he was reported missing in action on April 
18, 1972, at age 23. Air Force officials said that the F-4 Phantom jet he was 
navigating was on a bombing raid over Ha Bac province, about 35 miles northeast 
of Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
Bednarek's remains were charred, leading forensic analysts to conclude that his 
F-4 jet was downed and that he died in the crash, his father said. The 
Vietnamese also furnished an identification card with Bednarek's name and 
photograph, "which means they knew all these years that he was dead and never 
told us," he added. "Of all the grief and anger, that realization may have been 
the worst." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Belcher, a spokesman for the U.S. Pacific Command, which oversees the 
U.S. Army Central Identification Laboratory in Honolulu, said that he could not 
yet release details on the Bednarek case. But he said that each identification 
is a "painstaking" process, where teams of experts sift through remains and 
match them against computerized medical records, searching for a bone fracture 
or a tooth setting that may unlock the key to an identity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Move From Home 
</P>
<P>
A year after their son disappeared, the Bednareks moved from their house on 
Oakwood Street, a quiet one-way street in Greenlawn where they had reared 
Jonathan and their daughter Joanne, who is now 49 and lives in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't take it any more, to be in the house he had grown up in," Bednarek 
said. He and his wife now live in a retirement community in Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
But friends and neighbors still remember the Bednareks and the pride they 
showed when their son enlisted -- as well as the shock when they learned he was 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
The Bednareks were regarded as "very nice, very friendly people," said Albert 
Dicesare, who still lives next door to the family's former home. He described 
the son -- whom neighbors knew by his middle name, Bruce -- as a friendly, 
outgoing boy who liked to build models of battleships and fighter planes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very, Very Proud' 
</P>
<P>
When Bednarek joined the Air Force, his parents were "very, very proud of the 
fact that he was a flier and that he was flying for his country," Dicesare 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dicesare remembers looking out the window one day in 1972 and seeing two or 
three officers "wearing a lot of brass" knock on the Bednareks' front door. "I 
saw them come in . . . ," he said. "After that, they did change. They weren't 
the same happy-go-lucky couple. They were preoccupied, and of course, it was 
because of their son." 
</P>
<P>
Alice Rickard, the Bednareks' other former next-door neighbor on Oakwood 
Street, remembers another knock on their front door a few weeks later. "I 
remember when they shipped back his trunk, she was very upset. She left it in 
the hall, and she wouldn't open it until her husband got home. They were just 
devastated when their son was shot down." 
</P>
<P>
Like many other servicemen who failed to return from the Vietnam War, Bednarek 
was initially listed as a prisoner of war, and each time the names of freed 
prisoners were announced, the family's hope was buoyed. But a few years after 
the war ended, his status was changed to missing in action. In 1979, along with 
most others previously listed as MIAs and POWs, his status was changed to 
"presumed dead." Bednarek was awarded the Purple Heart and the Distinguished 
Flying Cross. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2,357 Unaccounted For 
</P>
<P>
All told, U.S. forensic experts have identified the remains of 226 other 
Americans who served in the Vietnam War. Another 2,357 Americans who served in 
Vietnam are still unaccounted for, Pentagon officials said. Of those, 1,723 
were last seen in Vietnam, 545 in Laos, 83 in Cambodia and six in China. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot rule out the possibility that some Americans are still alive or are 
being detained against their will in Vietnam since the fall of Saigon in 1975, 
but we are unable to prove it," said Lt. Cmdr. Jim Kudla, a Pentagon spokesman. 
The government is still investigating reported sightings of about 140 U.S. 
servicemen in Southeast Asia, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Around the country, the debate continues over whether the U.S. government is 
doing enough to find military personnel still missing in Southeast Asia. 
"Initially, a lot of us were critical of both governments' efforts to find 
those missing in Vietnam," said Rep. Robert J. Mrazek (D-N.Y.), who has been 
active in U.S.-Vietnam issues. But he said since the 1987 visit by Gen. John W. 
Vessey Jr. to Vietnam to discuss the problem with the Vietnamese, "I think both 
sides are working hard to resolve this issue." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Receive Confirmation 
</P>
<P>
For the Bednareks, five more agonizing months passed after the December call 
before the Bednareks received the recent confirmation that forensic teams at 
the laboratory in Hawaii had successfully matched the remains against their 
son's medical records. 
</P>
<P>
And that has brought some relief to Ed Ferraro, a 42-year-old Vietnam veteran 
who is vice president of the Freedom Foundation, a group that promotes public 
awareness of missing servicemen. Ferraro has been wearing a POW-MIA bracelet 
with Bednarek's name on it for two years. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got up and dressed and put on the bracelet, I'd look at the guy's name 
and wonder what kind of man he was, how he got shot down. . . . If they are his 
remains, and the family is willing to accept his remains, I'm relieved," 
Ferraro said.

AFTER 5 YEARS, ETHIOPIA JEWS FIND THAT ISRAEL ISN'T LAND OF MILK, HONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

ASHKELON, Israel 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five years have passed since Ayano Mamo abandoned his farm and began a 
monthslong odyssey from the forests of Ethiopia to the Holy Land, where "all 
would be bright and wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Now Mamo, like many of Israel's 16,500 Ethiopian Jewish immigrants, feels 
disillusioned and alienated in a country where quiet, traditional Africans 
don't quite fit in. 
</P>
<P>
Their primitive farming methods are not needed, their lack of sophistication is 
a cause for condescension, and their skin color is sometimes a target of 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Even Faith Questioned 
</P>
<P>
Even their Jewish faith has been questioned. 
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopians' disappointment is all the greater because of their harsh 
struggle to emigrate and their dramatic arrival from Sudan in the secret 
"Operation Moses" airlift, for which the United States provided planes and 
pilots. The operation was overseen by George Bush, then Ronald Reagan's vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Mamo's road to Israel was harder than most. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving his village in 1984, he was detained by anti-government Ethiopian 
rebels for a month. They beat his wife and stole his money. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Walked to Sudan 
</P>
<P>
Let go, the family joined 150 other emigrants in walking to Sudan. It took a 
month, and without adequate food and water their 2-year-old daughter died, one 
of 10 who perished en route. 
</P>
<P>
In Sudan, 25 more of the group died of malnutrition and disease, including 
Mamo's aunt, uncle and three nephews. 
</P>
<P>
"We had faith in the Holy One, blessed be He, that despite the suffering, He 
was with us," Mamo said through an interpreter in his native Amharic at his 
apartment in the southern coastal city of Ashkelon. 
</P>
<P>
As he walked through the desert, Mamo said, he "thought about the Israel of my 
dreams. All would be bright and wonderful. Even at night there would be 
sunshine, after we gathered in from the exile." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unemployment High 
</P>
<P>
Five years since the exodus, almost 30% of Ethiopians still live in 
dormitory-style government housing centers. The National Council for Ethiopian 
Jews says unemployment among the Ethiopian immigrants above age 35 is about 
45%. 
</P>
<P>
Mamo, 54, lives in a small government-supplied apartment with his wife and four 
of his children. He has no job, partly because he acquired a blood disease from 
drinking polluted water on the trek to Sudan and cannot do heavy work. 
</P>
<P>
The apartment complex where he lives is filled with almost 2,000 Ethiopian 
immigrants and is disparagingly called the "Ethiopian Ghetto" by unsympathetic 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Children Adapt Quickly 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials say they are making progress in settling the new immigrants. 
The children have proved able to quickly adapt to the new culture, with more 
than 400 Ethiopians enrolled in Israeli universities and many others serving in 
elite army units. 
</P>
<P>
But officials concede that the newest immigrants had more difficulties than any 
of the Jewish communities that came from Europe, the Middle East and North 
Africa as part of the in-gathering that began after the creation of Israel as a 
nation in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
"Most new immigrants spoke French or English and they had some skills," said 
Uri Gordon, director of immigration and absorption in the Jewish Agency. "With 
the Ethiopians, we had to start anew." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intensive Hebrew Classes 
</P>
<P>
He said Ethiopian immigrants are given intensive Hebrew classes and provided 
social workers to help them acclimate. 
</P>
<P>
The three-month "Operation Moses" airlift in 1984 brought more than 8,000 
Ethiopian Jews to Israel, joining others who managed to flee earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The new Ethiopian immigrants, many villagers who spoke only Amharic, found 
themselves shunted aside in a society known for its chutzpah, a Hebrew word 
meaning audacious to the point of rudeness. 
</P>
<P>
"We left our culture and came here where they don't speak our language or 
follow our customs, and now we find ourselves in poor jobs and gaining little 
respect," said Mesfin Ambau, director of the Jerusalem-based Organization of 
Ethiopian Immigrants. "There is a lot of pain inside." 
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopians' first confrontation in Israel was with the nation's powerful 
rabbinate, which ruled that the community, after 2,000 years of isolation from 
world Jewry, had deviated in its religious practice and needed to undergo 
symbolic conversions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nothing Hurt Us More' 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing hurt us more than that," said Ziv Sahelev, 20, an Ethiopian immigrant 
who lives in a government absorption center. 
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopians refused any type of conversions, and the rabbinate was forced to 
seek a compromise that quieted the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Like more than a third of the Ethiopian community, Sahalev left behind close 
relatives, in his case his father and three sisters, on the expectation that he 
would return and bring them to the Promised Land. 
</P>
<P>
But Ethiopia's Marxist government, which has no diplomatic relations with 
Israel and has close relations with radical Arab states, halted the airlift 
shortly after it was disclosed, and 15,000 Jews remain stranded in Ethiopia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Suicide Rate 
</P>
<P>
Rahamim Elazar, director of the National Council for Ethiopian Jews, said 
Ethiopian youngsters, many separated from their parents, have a suicide rate 
five times higher than other Israeli teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many who were left behind, and the children feel terribly 
guilty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sahalev said that since he came to Israel, he has given up hope of returning to 
Ethiopia to bring out the rest of his family. 
</P>
<P>
"I write to them every week, and after a month or two I get an answer," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem for the Ethiopians is that they are virtually the only blacks 
in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Butt of Jokes 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes people joke with me and point at me and start saying, 'Look, he's 
black,"' Sahalev said. "It makes me feel very uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
In Kiryat Chaim, a residential area of small cottages near Haifa in northern 
Israel, neighbors rose up in protest when the Jewish Agency moved four large 
Ethiopian families into the area's only apartment complex in January. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a quiet area, and people came to me and complained that the Ethiopian 
children made noise at night, they didn't throw their garbage away," said Giora 
Fischer, district head of Kiryat Chaim. 
</P>
<P>
"In informal ways, they also made it clear to me that they felt their property 
values were declining."

Palm Beach Circuit Judge Edward Garrison ruled last week that K mart was

NAMIBIA BUSHMEN STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL

<P>
They call themselves the Ju Wasi, meaning "correct people," and survive in 
eastern Namibia, descendants of the Bushmen who first inhabited the desert 
there 40,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We were the first, we have become the last. We must do something quickly," 
said Tsanko Toma. He heads a farming cooperative and acts as spokesman for 
about 600 Bushmen in the Kalahari Desert. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, they have gathered in 14 villages like this one south of Tsumkwe, 
one of the n'lore, their term for "the place we belong to," the land around the 
ancestral watering hole. 
</P>
<P>
The South African administration gave them everything they had never had and 
never desired: a school, a clinic, a church and a prison. But they also 
discovered what they were not expecting: malnutrition, alcoholism, despair, 
early death. 
</P>
<P>
Now they call Tsumkwe "the place of death," said Megam Biesele of the Bushman 
Development Foundation, a private body aiding the 600 Bushmen. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 1950s, several thousand were still hunting and gathering in 
the Kalahari. But in 1960 the South Africans allocated territory on ethnic 
lines, and the Bushmen lost 70% of their land. 
</P>
<P>
Living traditionally in groups of 40 to 50, with no practice of central 
organization and leadership to state their case, they were unsuited to 
competitive society, Megam Biesele explained. 
</P>
<P>
Tsumkwe lies at the end of a sandy 125 miles of arrow-straight road, and the 
sight of humans along the isolated road is like an apparition. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few houses for whites, while the Bushmen live in huts, many around 
the military base of the South African army's 203rd Battalion. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers have been using more than 500 Bushmen as trackers, but by next 
November the troops will have left under the U.N. independence plan for 
Namibia. There will be no more wages for the trackers. 
</P>
<P>
"They are all going to starve," warned American anthropologist John Marshall, 
the creator of the Bushman Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Tsanko Toma, who said he was born "somewhere around 1940," is emerging as a 
leader in a society that has no hierarchy of its own. 
</P>
<P>
He started the week in Windhoek, the territorial capital, meeting South African 
Administrator-General Louis Pienaar to "set out all the problems of the land." 
</P>
<P>
A particular concern was to voice fears that neighboring Herero tribesmen have 
designs on Bushman lands. 
</P>
<P>
Then he did the rounds of the villages, where the once nomadic Bushmen are 
trying to settle down as farmers and stock raisers, to tell them all he had 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
He made a similar tour after talks with Daniel Tjongarero, head of the internal 
branch of the main black nationalist grouping the South West Africa People's 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
SWAPO, whose guerrilla armed wing took up arms against Pretoria's presence in 
the territory nearly a quarter of a century ago, is widely expected to win the 
general election scheduled for November. 
</P>
<P>
Tsanko did not know which party he will vote for. It will be "a new day" after 
independence, but the Ju Wasi does not yet know how to take part in government, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fellow tribesman Gaishay, from the cooperative in Naru Na village, said he felt 
that none of the political parties was ready to give any thought to the future 
of the Bushmen. 
</P>
<P>
Children and old people watched in the village square as he spoke with the 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
As evening drew near, some men and women -- the sexes have always been on an 
equal footing among the Bushmen -- went off to do some hunting. 
</P>
<P>
As they have for thousands of years, they used bows and poisoned arrows. 
</P>
<P>
They are not allowed to have rifles. That is a privilege reserved for white 
tourists who come to shoot elephants and lions in Bushmanland.

NUMEIRI SPENDS DAYS IN CAIRO DREAMING OF POWER; 
</P>
<P>
EXILED SUDAN LEADER PLOTTING HIS RETURN

CAIRO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four years after he was ousted in a palace coup, Sudan's former president, 
Jaafar Numeiri, spends his time in a large, slightly decrepit villa, plotting 
to seize power again. 
</P>
<P>
He has aged visibly and put on weight during the years as a political outcast 
in Cairo. The villa and the guards patrolling it with automatic weapons are 
courtesy of the Egyptian government, which granted Numeiri political asylum 
after he was stranded in Cairo by his defense minister's coup. 
</P>
<P>
Numeiri had just returned from an aid-seeking visit to Washington on April 6, 
1985, when Gen. Abdul-Rahman Swareddahab sided with civil disobedience 
campaigners to oust him. 
</P>
<P>
Numeiri had been in power 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
During a rare interview earlier this month, the former strongman wore a white 
suit instead of the military uniform or traditional flowing white robes he 
favored as president of Africa's largest country. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke of his anger at his defense minister's betrayal, his life as an exile, 
the "government of thieves" ruling his country and his advice to Sudanese 
supporters: "Take over the power." 
</P>
<P>
The 59-year-old Numeiri said he socializes mostly with Sudanese who live in 
Egypt or visit Cairo and has little contact with his Egyptian benefactors other 
than requesting renovations for the villa. 
</P>
<P>
His kinky hair has turned almost totally white behind his receding hairline. 
His waistline has expanded into a pot belly. 
</P>
<P>
Numeiri claimed overwhelming support in Sudan and urged his countrymen to 
overthrow Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi, elected in 1986 in balloting overseen by 
Swareddahab's transitional military government. 
</P>
<P>
"I have felt hurt by the news I get from Sudan and about the suffering of the 
Sudanese people," Numeiri said. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who were deceived now call for the regime of Jaafar Numeiri. . . . I 
have received numerous letters and people, all asking me to save Sudan after it 
has fallen in a deep abyss, as they put it." 
</P>
<P>
Sudan was near bankruptcy when Numeiri was overthrown, and little has changed. 
Experts blame a succession of weak coalition governments that have failed to 
undertake reforms and work decisively to end a civil war that began in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Sudanese appear disillusioned by Mahdi's lack of progress, and some have been 
heard to speak wistfully of the Numeiri era, but there is no visible support 
for the ousted president on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Numeiri insisted in the interview that the Sudan he ruled was among the world's 
most democratic and prosperous countries. But in 1985, thousands of Sudanese 
danced in the streets after the coup, which was triggered by demonstrations 
against high prices, Islamic law and Numeiri's iron-fisted security policies. 
</P>
<P>
Similar demonstrations have rocked the country this year and, under pressure 
from the military, Mahdi was forced to form a broader-based coalition and 
prepare to negotiate with the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Mahdi's government has convicted several members of Numeiri's military regime 
for corruption and has a standing request that Egypt return the field marshal 
for trial. President Hosni Mubarak has refused, invoking Egypt's long tradition 
of providing political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
Numeiri's presence in Cairo has strained Egypt's relations with its southern 
neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Twice the former leader has broken his hosts' ban on political activity. In 
1985, he sent recorded messages to Sudan urging people to restore his power. 
This year, he has given a handful of interviews and admitted sending tapes and 
written speeches to Sudan to mark the 20th anniversary of his seizure of power. 
</P>
<P>
Numeiri said Cairo has expressed displeasure, "but the pressure on me from the 
Sudanese people does not allow me to keep my word to the Egyptian government."

SAHARAN TOWN ENTERS MODERN ERA;

ANCIENT EGYPT OASIS BLOOMS AGAIN

SIWA OASIS, Egypt 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The temple of the Siwan Oracle, where the superstitious young conqueror 
Alexander the Great was told he was a god, sits in ruin on its hillside perch. 
</P>
<P>
Shali, a majestic 13th-Century fortress that protected Siwans from medieval 
Bedouin marauders, is a sandcastle of rubble, stripped of its glory by neglect 
and the oasis' infrequent but devastating desert rains. 
</P>
<P>
The village silversmith is gone, along with most of the elaborately crafted 
jewelry -- gigantic bangles that jingled from the oasis' richly costumed women. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Distinct Language 
</P>
<P>
Berber and Sudanese heritage blended into Siwan life, along with other tongues 
and cultures carried over Saharan sands to form its roots and distinct 
language. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Siwa is gone. But much is left. 
</P>
<P>
As it has for a thousand years, life in Siwa -- about 75 miles from Libya in 
northern Egypt -- begins before dawn with the muezzim calling Muslims to prayer 
from minarets of mosques scattered through the oasis' date palms and olive 
groves. 
</P>
<P>
Then a donkey serenade begins. Hundreds bray, echoing through the palms, 
followed by a chorus of roosters. 
</P>
<P>
Early morning markets open to the cloppity-clop of donkeys pulling kerussahs, 
or family carts, driven by caftan-wearing men or boys. The women -- covered 
head-to-toe in flowing blue embroidered shawls called milayah -- sit behind 
with smaller children. 
</P>
<P>
Covered kerussahs provide the local taxi service, sharing bumpy roadways with 
military trucks and, with increasing frequency, tourist buses from Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
Camels never made it big in Siwa. Donkeys are cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Highway 
</P>
<P>
Until the early 1980s, virtually all sounds and sights in Siwa would have been 
familiar to Siwans of earlier centuries. But four years ago, a highway became 
the oasis' umbilical cord to Egypt and the Arabic language. 
</P>
<P>
The three-hour, 190-mile drive from Mersa Matrouh on the western Egyptian coast 
covers generally the same desert route over which, 2,000 years ago, people from 
around the Mediterranean -- Alexander among them -- trekked for more than a 
week seeking the wisdom of the famed desert oracle. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, buyers for chic boutiques in Cairo and Europe have traveled it, 
taking with them the best jewelry and handicrafts. 
</P>
<P>
Television invaded Siwa in 1986, and more than 1,000 sets were sold the first 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Young Siwans, now heading in increasing numbers for higher education in Cairo 
and Alexandria, have far fewer traditions to remember but many more influences 
to contemplate. 
</P>
<P>
But for Siwa's 10,000 inhabitants, the infusion and confusion hasn't been all 
bad. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clean Water 
</P>
<P>
A year-old U.S. aid project gives them clean water for the first time. 
Extracted from salty subterranean pools, the desalinated water costs 5 piasters 
(just over 2 cents) a jerrycan, which even the poor can afford, instead of 75 
piasters (30 cents) when water was trucked from outside. 
</P>
<P>
Electricity supplies remain uncertain and sporadic, but Czechoslovakian 
generators are being installed that promise a constant power supply. 
</P>
<P>
And one aid project is working to save Siwa's soul. 
</P>
<P>
More than a year ago, Marc Perron, then Canada's ambassador to Egypt, asked 
Siwan officials what his country could do for their changing oasis. The answer: 
save the Siwan heritage. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody talked for years about how to save Siwa, that its cultural heritage 
must be saved, but nobody did anything about it," said Heba Kholy, fund 
coordinator at the Canadian Embassy in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian project aims to build a traditional Siwan house in the old way, 
using mudbrick and palm trunks and to teach young people old skills. 
</P>
<P>
Now nearing completion, the two-story house in the village garden will become a 
museum dedicated to Siwan culture and a reservoir for handicrafts. 
</P>
<P>
Six miles away, in a poor desert village, Khadiga Ismail Sami has spent the 
last year teaching five girls, aged 11 to 15, to embroider bridal scarfs in the 
Siwan way. Siwan girls, who marry about age 14, must have an extensive bridal 
trousseau, including seven elaborate wedding dresses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Passing On Skills 
</P>
<P>
Sami is among nine women team leaders, each passing along her sewing or 
basket-making artistry to five girls. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian project has supplied each of Sami's apprentices material for 
bridal scarfs, which can take months to complete. 
</P>
<P>
Once finished, she has the option of keeping them or selling them back to the 
project for 5 Egyptian pounds (about $2) each. 
</P>
<P>
"A bride has to have these scarfs for her wedding," Sami said. "If she has to 
buy them ready-made, she will have to pay 75 pounds ($30) for one scarf."

<P>
Composer Henri Sauguet, best known for his sophisticated but simple ballet 
scores, among them "Musique des Forains," died at his home in Paris on Thursday 
after a long illness, his family said. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
Sauguet had been partly paralyzed for two years and had been suffering from 
heart problems, his son told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
Sauguet, who was born Henri Pierre Poupard in Bordeaux but took his mother's 
maiden name, studied the piano and the organ as a child. 
</P>
<P>
After World War I, he moved to Paris and met such other musicians as Charles 
Koechlin, Darius Milhaud and Erik Satie. They formed a group they called Ecole 
d'Arcueil from the area near Paris where Satie lived. 
</P>
<P>
Sauguet's first real success came in 1924 with the production at the Champs 
Elysees Theater of "Le Plumet du Colonel." 
</P>
<P>
He went on to compose such ballets as "La Chatte," directed by Sergei Diagliev 
for the Ballets Russes and choreographed by George Balanchine in Monte Carlo in 
1927, Ida Rubenstein's "David" and Jean Giradoux's "Ondine." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his scores for at least 14 ballets, eight theatrical 
productions, symphonies, quartets, collections of songs and scores for about 35 
films, Sauguet tried operatic scores. 
</P>
<P>
The lengthy "La Chartreuse de Parme" was produced in 1939 at the Paris Opera. 
It received mixed reviews, and Sauguet went back to his first love -- ballet. 
</P>
<P>
"Les Forains," which translates loosely as "Wanderers' Music," was written for 
France's Roland Petit Company in 1945. Amid the euphoria at the end of World 
War II, it touched a popular chord, and Sauguet's fame spread abroad. 
</P>
<P>
In the postwar years he composed mainly comic opera and later wrote popular 
musical scores for children. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976 he was elected a member of the French Institute, to the chair 
previously occupied by Milhaud at the Academie des Beaux-Arts.

Boyd P. (Bud) Welin, civic activist, former mayor of Pasadena and a lifelong 
supporter of USC, has died at his Laguna Hills home, USC officials announced 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Welin, who with his late wife established a professorship in pharmaceutical 
sciences at USC in 1988, was 85 when he died June 14. 
</P>
<P>
A pharmacist who graduated from USC in 1927, Welin was a former member of the 
USC Board of Trustees and past president of the General Alumni Assn. He 
co-founded the Brown and Welin Prescription Pharmacists firm in Pasadena after 
Army service in World War II and owned it solely from 1969 to 1979, when he 
sold it. 
</P>
<P>
He was mayor of Pasadena from 1966 until he resigned in 1968, citing the press 
of business.

Donald Dayton, former chairman of Dayton's department stores, has died of 
cancer at age 74. 
</P>
<P>
Dayton, the eldest of five brothers who made Dayton's into a retailing giant, 
underwent surgery for colon cancer last year and had been critically ill for 
the last six months, family members said. He died Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Dayton Corp. merged in 1969 with J. L. Hudson Co., forming the Dayton-Hudson 
Corp., which now has 660 stores in 38 states and is the nation's fifth-largest 
retailer. 
</P>
<P>
The company owns the Target discount store chain, Mervyn's department stores 
and the Lechmere promotional discount store chain. 
</P>
<P>
Dayton, a grandson of the firm's founder, began working at Dayton's in 1937 as 
a clerk and stock boy. He moved through the ranks as a buyer, divisional 
merchandising manager, general superintendent, assistant general manager and 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
In 1950, he became president and general manager on the death of his father, 
George Nelson Dayton. In 1960, he was elected chief executive officer, and he 
became chairman in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Dayton, along with his four brothers and a cousin, launched a major expansion 
program for the downtown Minneapolis department store founded in 1902 by their 
grandfather, George D. Dayton. 
</P>
<P>
There was only one Dayton's store when Donald Dayton began working for the 
company, but by time he resigned in 1968, Dayton Corp., as it was then known, 
had grown to about 60 stores in 15 states and was the country's 14th-largest 
retailer. 
</P>
<P>
Dayton, who suffered from polio as a child, founded the Sister Kenny Institute,

Jerusalem police chief Yosef Yehudai, who walked a fine line trying to maintain 
order while not overreacting against the Palestinian population, died Friday of 
a heart attack, officials said. He was 42. 
</P>
<P>
The Romanian-born Yehudai emigrated to Israel in 1961 and had served with the 
paramilitary border police and regular police since he was 17. 
</P>
<P>
Yehudai, appointed commander of police forces in Jerusalem three years ago, had 
confronted frequent outbreaks of violence in the disputed city since the 
Palestinian uprising broke out in December, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken, pipe-smoking Yehudai was often seen commanding his forces 
during Palestinian stone-throwing clashes with police in east Jerusalem, 
annexed by Israel after the 1967 Middle East war. The city is populated by 
Jews, Muslims and Christians. 
</P>
<P>
Yehudai is survived by his wife, also a police officer, and two daughters.

MISSING THE POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am an 11th-grade student attending the University of San Diego High School 
and I have recently finished reading "Death of a Salesman" in my honors 
American literature class. Rev. Billy Falling's proposed prevention of aloud 
reading of certain literature such as this is disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
This gentleman is apparently overlooking the entire significance of works by 
Arthur Miller and others. It is offensive that he is proposing a ban on a play 
he has read only one fifth of. He is missing the whole meaning, the whole 
greatness of this work. Perhaps if he were to sit down and read the play from 
cover to cover, instead of skimming 13 pages in search of profanities, his 
theoretical arguments might have some ground. 
</P>
<P>
He is overlooking the themes portrayed in this play represented by Willy, an 
old man fighting to be remembered, to be a success. He is representative of all 
those pursuing wrong goals of wealth, success and material value. Through his 
death, the reader learns of the tragedy of designing one's life around personal 
gain. Rev. Falling might be surprised to find that students can learn a lesson 
from literature of this nature. Speaking from my class experience with this 
play, I know that our class as a whole learned more about theme and American 
culture than we did about new profanities. I doubt that any student finished 
that play and only remembered a few "hells and damns." 
</P>
<P>
There is so much more involved here, and Falling is obviously ignoring all of 
it in his radical proposal. What do his objections pose to the students? They 
place an emphasis on the vocabulary of a work, and devalue its cultural 
standing.

GOVERNOR NEEDS TO AID MIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The images of men, women and children living in cardboard and tarp-covered 
hooches with no running water or toilet facilities have faded somewhat from the 
public eye. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year when county health officials were forcing landowners to 
dismantle the makeshift migrant camps in the canyons and hillsides of North 
County, pictures of the migrants' plight were plentiful in the media. San 
Diegans were frequently forced to face a long-ignored problem. 
</P>
<P>
The reminders are fewer, now that some of the camps have been closed. But the 
problem has not lessened. Perhaps as many as 15,000 migrants, most of whom are 
now legal residents, remain homeless, according to some estimates. That's three 
times the size of the county's non-migrant homeless population. 
</P>
<P>
We hope Gov. George Deukmejian will remember this and look back at the 
newspaper and television accounts of the camps as he is deciding whether to 
approve $500,000 in seed money for migrant worker housing for San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the first state money for migrant housing San Diego County has 
received, despite the fact that the county ranks 12th in California in volume 
of agricultural products. Why the county is so far behind in building migrant 
worker housing is difficult to pin down and varies depending on whom you talk 
to: The state rules are too restrictive, the land is not available or there has 
been little local support. This last reason was cited by Deukmejian last year 
when he vetoed a similar $500,000 budget item. 
</P>
<P>
Whether or not that was the real reason for the veto, there is some truth to 
the accusation. Local officials have never applied for state money. Migrant 
housing has not been a priority. 
</P>
<P>
But that has begun to change, in part because so many of the migrants are now 
legal residents -- more than two-thirds, according to the U. S. Border Patrol 
-- under the amnesty program. Farmers and growers are worrying that they may 
lose newly legal workers to less backbreaking jobs, and they see housing as a 
possible way to keep workers in agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
Also fueling the interest have been complaints about the health risks posed by 
makeshift migrant camps and the decision by county health officials to close 
many of the camps. 
</P>
<P>
This prompted Assemblyman Robert Frazee (R-Carlsbad) to put together a 
broad-based working group of government and community leaders to look for ways 
to provide housing and to marshal the support necessary to persuade the 
governor to approve this year's budget request. Group members see some 
progress, but little can be accomplished without money. 
</P>
<P>
The $500,000 that Frazee has shepherded through the Legislature won't shelter 
many people. But with the 25% required match from local government and money 
from federal and private sources, housing officials think the $500,000 can be 
leveraged into as much as $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
Even that will not go far. But it's a start. 
</P>
<P>
What's needed now is a show of local support, one too strong for the governor 
to ignore. Five members of the county's legislative delegation have co-authored 
Frazee's bill, and the county and the cities of Carlsbad, Encinitas and 
Oceanside have formally endorsed the funding request. Resolutions are pending 
in a couple of other cities. 
</P>
<P>
The show of support should be unanimous. It's time to remember the faces of the 
migrants living in the brush and to put an end to years of neglect.

THE USE OF NUNCHAKUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States reads: 
</P>
<P>
"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel 
and unusual punishments inflicted." 
</P>
<P>
The use of nunchakus on peaceful Operation Rescue protesters by the San Diego 
Police Department is clearly cruel and unusual. Their use has resulted in 
broken bones, sprains and other physical anguish. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego police chief, city manager and members of the Citizens Advisory 
Board on Police-Community Relations believe that such measures are not cruel 
("Advisory Board Supports Police Use of Nunchakus on Protesters," June 15). For 
a fair evaluation, they should subject themselves to such handling. 
</P>
<P>
When and where else in this state have such measures been used on peaceful 
protesters? Certainly not on animal protection protesters or on anti-Operation 
Rescue protesters. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Skorepa, acting chairwoman of the advisory board, is setting up herself 
and the police as judge and jury when she says, "If . . . you're willing to 
violate the law and be arrested, then you must be willing to accept the 
consequences." 
</P>
<P>
Determination of guilt and punishment, or consequences, if you will, are 
functions of courts of law, not arresting officers. The San Diego police chief 
was right when he said the Operation Rescue people "made the men and women of 
the San Diego Police Department look bad." However, it was the brutal actions 
of the police themselves that made them look bad. 
</P>
<P>
We should be concerned that our law enforcement officers are allowed to use 
such means. The Eighth Amendment protects all citizens at all times, and, even 
when a person is convicted of a crime, the punishment must be fair, humane and 
uniform.

LOTTERY MILLIONAIRES GATHER AT FAIR TO SHARE THEIR GOOD FORTUNES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Victor Khouri's dream came true in many ways when his quick-pick Lotto numbers 
were the winners in a California state lottery drawing last year. 
</P>
<P>
Khouri, a San Diego bookbinder, said he had a premonition that he would win 
because he had dreamed on his birthday exactly one month earlier that he would 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been pretty lucky; that was my lucky day," Khouri said of the Jan. 27, 
1988, drawing in which he and two others won $1.46 million each. 
</P>
<P>
Khouri was one of a group of San Diego County lottery millionaires who gathered 
at the Del Mar Fair on Saturday to share experiences and dreams of hitting the 
"big one" with fairgoers. 
</P>
<P>
The get-together was sponsored by the state lottery's San Diego district 
office, which has an informational booth at the fair. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the financial security, many of the winners on hand said their life had 
not changed much. 
</P>
<P>
"It really hasn't," said Sharon Sniffin, who won $1.78 million in November, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Though she purchased a new Mustang convertible for her daughter Katherine, 15, 
the Santee resident said the winnings -- distributed in annual payments over 20 
years -- will be invested and used to pay for her two daughters' college 
educations. She still works as an office manager for California Carpets. 
</P>
<P>
Sniffin's daughter got the car because "She deserved it, she picked the 
numbers," Sniffin said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were sitting at home on a lazy day, and I said I was going to buy some 
tickets, and she was concentrating on her book -- didn't really want to be 
bothered -- and rattled off some numbers." 
</P>
<P>
The most difficult thing, Sniffin said, was waiting to find out how many others 
would share in the $7.01-million jackpot. Four winners, including Sniffin and 
Jamul resident John M. Hanks, split the prize. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had won the whole amount, we'd have probably gone hog wild," Sniffin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent San Diego Big Spin winner, Stephen Jacobson of La Mesa, said he 
had an inkling that he might become a millionaire. His best friend had told him 
he would win $1 million, and at a party given him by co-workers, he cut out a 
million-dollar slice of cake shaped like the Big Spin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'People Tell Me I'm Lucky' 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson, 26, a claim specialist with the San Diego district attorney's office, 
won $1 million on the Big Spin on June 10. He had previously won $1,000 in a 
lotto scratch-off game. A year ago, he won a cruise. 
</P>
<P>
"People tell me I'm lucky," Jacobson said. 
</P>
<P>
He will receive $40,000 annually for the next 20 years. A few fairgoers 
Saturday recognized Jacobson from the airing of the Big Spin television show. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely an experience," he said. "The ball fell out of one 
million-dollar slot into another one. I was jumping up and down when it 
stopped."

HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS GIVEN $100,000 BY TIMES FUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Times Fund has again awarded $100,000 in educational 
grants-in-aid to 200 graduating high school seniors throughout Southern 
California. The grants will enable the students to continue their education 
next fall. 
</P>
<P>
The $500 awards were presented this month at ceremonies conducted at public and 
private schools in San Diego, Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
The grants-in-aid program, started by the Times Fund in 1967, provides grants 
to students whose high school grade-point average is 2.9 or below, but whom 
teachers or counselors designate as having high potential for academic success. 
Since its inception, the program has awarded more than 6,000 grants totaling 
more than $2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The grants may be used at trade or technical schools, colleges or universities. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, The Times has quietly supported San Diego's youth with programs 
designed to brighten the present and enrich the future," said Phyllis Pfeiffer, 
general manager of the San Diego County Edition of The Times. "Encouraging 
deserving local seniors to pursue their dreams of higher education is a 
particularly rewarding role." 
</P>
<P>
"These students have demonstrated a desire to get the schooling necessary to 
become productive, contributing members of their communities. The Times is 
proud to help turn that drive for advancement into reality," said Tom Johnson, 
publisher and chief executive officer of The Times and president of the Times 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
The grants-in-aid program is supported by the proceeds of various 
Times-sponsored events, such as the Sundance World Class cycling event last 
month at the velodrome in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
These students, listed with their high schools, are grant recipients in San 
Diego County this year:

DOCTORS USE ART CREATED BY SUFFERERS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HEADACHES 
</P>

<P>
Doctors dealing with the headache, the most common and perhaps most frustrating 
form of pain, are using art created by sufferers to learn more about the often 
debilitating condition. 
</P>
<P>
A new collection of headache art -- paintings, prints, photos, sculpture and 
mixed media -- solicited from all types of sufferers made its world premiere 
earlier this month in conjunction with a national medical conference on 
headaches. 
</P>
<P>
"One patient who saw that exhibit told me: 'It is extremely comforting to see 
this. It so vividly shows what I suffer from when I hide in my bedroom, close 
the curtains and lock the door. It means I am not crazy. This is not my 
imagination. It means other people are suffering the same thing,' " said Dr. 
Egilius Spierings, the Dutch-born head of Faulkner Hospital's Headache Research 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
After a one-evening show at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the 200 works will 
move to nearby Faulkner Hospital for a one-week public exhibition at the John 
R. Graham Headache Center. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers say headache is the most common pain form reported to physicians. 
Five percent of the world's population has a headache every day, and an 
estimated 45 million Americans suffer from chronic headaches. 
</P>
<P>
The headache costs the nation $8 billion in lost work time and medical 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Spierings said letting sufferers express their pain through art can aid in a 
diagnostic process that is purely subjective, enhanced by no instrumentation. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very difficult to get people to understand what suffering from headaches 
means," Spierings said. "All we can rely upon is what patients tell us. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of that communication is lost because of concepts. We can only hear what 
we fit into our concepts. We perpetuate the existing knowledge more than expand 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
"Through art, patients can express features of their headaches unrestricted by 
existing medical concepts. Ultimately the patients are going to teach us what 
is right and what is wrong about our concepts of the headache." 
</P>
<P>
Spierings put out a call earlier this year to New England headache sufferers to 
express their pain through art. He did so after viewing a British exhibit, done 
in the early 1980s of art involving migraines -- one of the three common 
chronic headache disorders. 
</P>
<P>
"Gripping Headache," a drawing by Raymond Dorow II, expresses the physical pain 
level and emotional frustration of throbbing head pain over which he has no 
control. 
</P>
<P>
A work by Rebekah Raye, "Headache No. 1," shows that eye pain and disturbed 
vision can be a part of the headache experience -- a connection disputed by 
some vision experts. 
</P>
<P>
"Twenty-five of the 200 pieces of art depict in a very pronounced way the eye 
or the visual system. 'Headache No. 1' shows pain caused by intense of light. I 
have never seen it expressed so well," Spierings said. 
</P>
<P>
Some artists also submitted written descriptions of what triggered their 
artistic expression. 
</P>
<P>
"All are headache sufferers, not necessarily artists. There is a lot of hidden 
talent here," Spierings said. "Many of them are extraordinary."

THE VERY REAL NEED FOR LOW-COST HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County's affluence may explain the ranking, but it still seems 
ridiculous to identify families earning $40,000 to $60,000 a year as members of 
low-income households. Even more ridiculous is an official policy that is 
geared to provide subsidized housing for people in that bracket, with 
practically nothing for poorer people. 
</P>
<P>
But that has been the case in Orange County in recent years. Fortunately, 
advocates for the homeless and the poor have been pressuring the county to 
adopt a more realistic program. Their efforts received an added push when the 
County Planning Commission, in reviewing the 1989 housing element of the 
General Plan, urged the addition of a "very low-income" category that would 
cover the significant number of county residents earning $25,000 a year or 
less. 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the County Board of Supervisors officially adopted that 
category. But the board unwisely backed away from another commission 
recommendation to set a goal of building 1,207 homes and apartments in the next 
five years for those "very low-income" residents. A commitment to 1,207 homes 
is a very modest goal, considering that surveys by the Southern California 
Assn. of Governments place the need for living quarters for those residents at 
more than 3,000 units in the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Although the supervisors did move in the right direction, just having a more 
realistic income category is not enough. Along with other incentives, money to 
subsidize construction for the more affordable housing must also be made 
available. One way is with a special housing trust fund that the county board 
and city councils should be providing. Among possible revenue sources for such 
trust funds are fees from industrial and commercial builders and tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Working with the private sector to provide housing for lower-income residents 
is sound public policy from an economic as well as a social standpoint. As the 
county's job market continues to grow, it creates more pressure for affordable 
housing. A solid homes-jobs balance must be maintained for good economic 
health. So it makes sense for those who help create the jobs to also help in 
creating housing for the new employees they attract. If they don't, residents 
priced out of the available housing will continue to move elsewhere, drying up 
the labor pool and adding to the county's traffic congestion and environmental 
decay. That could be far more costly than housing incentives and subsidies. 
</P>

The county has finally recognized that families earning $25,000 a year or less 
are the ones that need the most help. The next step is actually providing it.

PARENTS AS PROTECTORS OF CHILDREN'S LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In following the coverage of the tragic fire at the day-care center in 
Huntington Beach, I am dismayed that there is no mention whatsoever of any 
sympathy for Pat Orozco. 
</P>
<P>
If the background you printed was accurate, it sounds like she was a very 
conscientious person, doing a good job of caring for children for many years. 
She was following instructions -- she got a fire extinguisher when she was told 
to get either that or a smoke alarm. 
</P>
<P>
It sounds like she made heroic efforts to rescue the children. Others tried and 
were unable to do it. She was not only burned in the fire, she will be 
emotionally scarred for life. The memory of this will be hell to live with. 
</P>
<P>
What is left of her home? Is she covered by fire insurance? If not, how will 
she rebuild? She made her living caring for children. Will she be able to do 
this again? Will the stigma of this tragedy prevent parents from ever leaving 
children in her care? 
</P>
<P>
I do not mean to belittle the devastating tragedy that has occurred for the 
families of the children. I simply think we should be recognizing the 
heartbreak for Pat Orozco.

SAVING THE OFFICE OF FAMILY PLANNING WOULD SAVE MONEY IN LONG RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANETTE M. REESE, Jeanette M. Reese is president of the board of directors 
of Planned Parenthood/Orange and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marie G. is 31. She has seven children and she is poor. I met her at a Planned 
Parenthood clinic where she is a patient. Like the rest of us, rich, poor and 
middle income, she has plans for her life, dreams that she hopes will lead her 
to better circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Becoming pregnant again isn't part of that plan, and yet the agencies that she 
has used to provide her with birth control face futures as uncertain as she 
faces. That's because Gov. George Deukmejian in January proposed eliminating 
the state Office of Family Planning in order to trim the budget to meet the 
then-projected deficit. OFP is the only source of public funds for more clinics 
that treat the poor who are seeking family planning assistance. Using $78 of 
OFP funds, our clinic can give Marie a gynecological exam, cancer screening and 
a year's worth of birth control supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The first half of 1989 has been tumultuous for reproductive rights. The OFP cut 
was announced as the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments in Webster vs. 
Reproductive Health Services, an abortion test case that could change the laws 
regarding legalized abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Marie doesn't know much about the Webster case. To her, abortion is not the 
primary issue. "I don't want an abortion," she told me. "I just don't want to 
get pregnant." For women coping with the harsh realities of poverty, birth 
control is essential, which means the Office of Family Planning is essential. 
</P>
<P>
Marie's perspective on the fate of OFP reduces the issue to its essential 
element: debate over abortion is moot if pregnancy is prevented. Because people 
are demonstrably unwilling to give up the physical act that leads to pregnancy, 
abstinence from sexual activity is not a viable plan for prevention. That 
leaves birth control as the only practical method for attempting to prevent 
unwanted pregnancies and the host of medical, social and moral issues that 
surround these unhappy events. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are the politicians in Sacramento who are grappling with the 
question of reinstating the OFP budget. They are less interested in social and 
moral dilemmas than they are in dollars -- taxpayers' dollars, in fact. After 
all, it's not the job of elected officials to worry about individuals like 
Marie. Their charter is to see to it that the decisions made bring the greatest 
good to the most people. 
</P>
<P>
Fair enough. Ignore the 500,000 Maries of this state who utilized OFP-funded 
programs last year. Set aside the emotional arguments about reproductive 
rights. Look, instead, at the economics of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Are the taxpayers of California getting a decent return for the money that's 
being invested in the Office of Family Planning? The answer is yes. For every 
dollar spent on family planning, $11.20 is saved in future medical and welfare 
costs, according to a study released in April by the Institute for Health 
Policy Studies at UC San Francisco. You see, OFP dollars are not limited to 
birth control methods and exams, but include other family planning services 
such as counseling, education and sterilizations. 
</P>
<P>
So, spend one dollar today on preventing a pregnancy and you won't spend $11.20 
on social costs that begin with the delivery of an unwanted child. Delivering 
the baby is the least of the items on this list. Poor mothers don't have access 
to adequate prenatal care, and their babies run higher risks than non-poverty 
children of having medical problems at birth. That $11.20 includes the ongoing 
cost of care for babies born ill and with birth defects. That money also 
includes such tax-funded programs as day care, foster care, and welfare. It 
does not include the cost of dealing with abused children because at present 
there are no statistical links between unwanted pregnancies and child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
With or without a deficit, it's an obvious choice for money-conscious 
legislators and the governor as well. Spending the proposed $34.6 million on 
family planning services this year will save at least $400 million in future 
costs. Our officials have the option of saving their successors the pain of 
trying to rectify a major fiscal mistake. 
</P>
<P>
But this issue is not that clear cut. From January's projected budget deficit, 
we have now moved into this month's projected budget surplus of about $1 
billion. Under the circumstances, it should be a simple matter for the people 
in power in Sacramento to reinstate funding and even add dollars to the OFP 
budget. However, Proposition 98, approved by voters last November, says that 
40% of all unbudgeted surplus funds must go to education. There are indications 
that Proposition 98 could provide a smoke screen for indecisive politicians -- 
both in the governor's mansion and in the Capitol -- to hide behind. This is 
the group of politicians that doesn't want to become caught up in the issue of 
reproductive rights by advocating retention of the OFP budget. Instead, they 
might choose to declare that the matter has been taken from their hands by the 
dictates of Proposition 98, thereby letting the proposed cut stand. 
</P>
<P>
That would be wrong. Proposition 98 allows them not only to reinstate the $34.6 
million, but to increase it. Given the UC San Francisco study, it's the 
smartest money they could spend. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Marie. She'd agree.

BOARD VOTE ON THE AIDS ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is anyone paying attention out there? You people who continue to support County 
Supervisors Gaddi H. Vasquez, Don R. Roth and Roger R. Stanton. You people who 
continue to re-elect Rep. William E. Dannemeyer who stands before groups, opens 
his mouth and spews out falsehoods which only further ignite the hysteria, hate 
and ignorance of the uneducated and short-sighted opposition to an anti-AIDS 
discrimination ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to these officials, Orange County can now hold its head in shame as 
being the only urban county in California to ban this ordinance. How long are 
you going to keep your heads in the sand and pretend this is a "gay disease" 
which we can ignore? 
</P>
<P>
Ignorance and fear cannot be tolerated in the fight against AIDS. Don't wait 
until you are personally affected by AIDS-related death of a friend or 
co-worker. Let Vasquez, Roth, Stanton and particularly Dannemeyer know they 
made a major error and that you won't continue to support such backward 
thinking.

BOARD VOTE ON THE AIDS ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again the right-wing reactionaries are pushing their will onto the 
majority of us who aren't fundamentalists. I'm referring to the defeat of the 
AIDS anti-discrimination vote of the Orange County Board of Supervisors. When 
will these alleged do-gooders realize that their medieval values are not those 
of the general population? Who appointed them the omniscient overseers of the 
values and morals of others? 
</P>
<P>
Louis Sheldon says he serves those "religious persons of any persuasion who 
believe there are moral absolutes." Well, what about the rest of us who aren't 
religious zealots? Does he imply that the non-fundamentalist has no morals? 
Hardly. This non-fundamentalist holds many moral absolutes, the strongest of 
which is, "don't force your beliefs, platitudes, ideals, and common-good 
nonsense down my throat." 
</P>
<P>
The fact that he and other loons like William Dannemeyer can force the vote of 
a popularly elected body by bombarding it with phone calls from their obedient 
flocks is pretty frightening. The issue isn't AIDS; it's the clout that these 
people possess in regards to laws that affect everyone. 
</P>
<P>
An issue such as the AIDS anti-discrimination law is far too touchy and 
sensitive to be decided by such a politically and morally bankrupt group as our 
Board of Supervisors. It needs to go to a popular vote.

THE MESSAGE IN A $96 TICKET THAT WAS HANDED OUT TO 15-YEAR-OLD BICYCLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since I seem to have created a furor of backlash with my letter (June 11) 
regarding my 15-year-old who got the $96 bicycle ticket, I would appreciate the 
opportunity of responding. 
</P>
<P>
First, in the interest of brevity, I did not accurately portray the actual 
incident in my original letter. Contrary to the impression it evidently 
conveyed, and which The Times' accompanying illustration reinforced, my son did 
not ignore a stop sign and go zooming out into an intersection. He was making a 
right-hand turn. What he did was slow, check the traffic (none was in the 
vicinity, so no, he did not fail to yield the right of way to another vehicle) 
and then continue on around the corner without coming to a complete stop. In 
Irvine, this means that at no time did his tires leave the bike lane. (It also 
means that the chance of his becoming a "lifeless body" due to this action were 
slim to none.) 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Hermon (letters June 18) fondly reminisces that in Colorado the kids would 
be hauled to the station house and upon apologizing to the officer and 
promising not to do it again, the ticket wuld "disappear." My son did apologize 
to the officer, on the spot of his own volition. But apparently justice is not 
served in the same way as in Colorado. The officer went ahead and ticketed him 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Let's talk about bicycles and traffic laws. Every kid who learns to ride a 
two-wheeler becomes a bike rider. I wonder how many of these children know what 
the California vehicle code requires? Since they are not required to pass a 
test and be licensed, as are vehicle drivers, how many of them do you think 
read the manual? I think most rely on basic common-sense safety precautions, 
such as don't cross against the red, use crosswalks, look both ways, which 
would leave them open to a great many offenses committed out of ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
We did not go to court to try to "get out of" the charge, or assert that my son 
was not guilty. What we did do was go to assert that the penalty was not 
equitable to the crime. Would anyone feel it just if the fine had been $200? 
$400? How about $1,000? If you agree to the inequity of any of these, then you 
agree to what I asserted. Mainly, that there comes a point -- somewhere -- when 
the fine ceases to be appropriate to the offense. Where that point comes 
depends, I suppose, on your financial frame of reference. 
</P>
<P>
To those who wrote, $96 may not be a lot of money, I don't know how many 
15-year-olds can pull this amount out of their pockets, but I know ours can't. 
And we, who still cannot afford to buy the most modest home here, can't either. 
</P>
<P>
The point is, are the courts now operating under the theory that the bigger the 
fine, the better-learned the lesson? If the real purpose here, or in any ticket 
issued to a child, is indeed concern for his safety, wouldn't a far more 
effective measure be to require his attendance at a bicycle safety class? 
</P>
<P>
What message am I giving my son? Hopefully, that the law in this country is 
just. That the penalties dealt are appropriate to the offenses committed. And 
that if you're issued a bicycle ticket and charged a fine, it's because the 
officer is truly concerned about your safety -- not because the city needs to 
pay for the new City Hall.

THE DEFLECTION POLICY AT UCI MEDICAL CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recently instituted deflection program at UCI Medical Center has engendered 
heated debates, sometimes degenerating into unsubstantiated accusations and 
recriminations. 
</P>
<P>
As residents in obstetrics and gynecology, we have experienced the consequences 
of the enormous increase in the volume of deliveries. In a unit built to safely 
handle 250 deliveries per month, we have over the years seen this number climb 
steadily to as high as 550 deliveries per month. It has become an 
all-too-familiar scene to have women laboring and delivering in hallways and on 
gurneys. This is not only unsafe and unacceptable, but also degrading and 
dehumanizing to the patients seeking care. 
</P>
<P>
The media have unfortunately seized the financial aspect of the deflection 
decision and have chosen to ignore the most important facet of the deflection 
program -- to continue providing an outstanding and safe level of care. Every 
patient who has not received prenatal care at UCIMC, be she funded or unfunded, 
will be turned away once we reach full status. Our own patients will be 
admitted in all situations. The receiving care as evidenced by the fact that, 
since its inception, the medical center has almost single-handedly shouldered 
the burden of indigent care for the inhabitants of the county. It is indeed 
hypocritical and ironic for private hospital administrators around Orange 
County to preach morality and insinuate impropriety when for years they have 
ignored our pleas for help. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County, one of the wealthiest counties in the United States, has a 
growing number of working poor who cannot afford the medical care they need. 
Every civilized society has a humane and moral duty to care for its less 
fortunate with little financial support from the county. Less affluent counties 
than Orange County allocate far more funds to care for their indigent. A system 
that has been held together in recent times by last-minute financial bailouts 
is, with the present overcrowding and understaffing, threatening to collapse. 
In concrete terms, if the tremendous increase in volume, if the shortage of 
equipment, if the insufficiency of nursing and doctor staff, were to cost us 
the life of a baby or a mother, we feel that is too dear a price to pay and 
accordingly are in full support of the difficult and drastic measure of 
deflection.

The Irvine Task Force for the Homeless, along with many other concerned 
citizens in this area, is appalled at the threat to the existence of the most 
outstanding care-giving organizations in Orange County. Share Our Selves (SOS)

EXPOS GOT LANGSTON -- MUCH TO CHAGRIN OF METS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each time the thought of being the most lusted-after bit of baseball flesh is 
suggested, Mark Langston turns his head away. Reality comes before fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
He left the fantasy, he said, when the New York Mets didn't get him from 
Seattle and the Montreal Expos did. That's reality. He won't become a free 
agent until the season is over. 
</P>
<P>
He's now the Dwight Gooden of the Montreal pitching staff, and the Expos are 
giving Langston something to think about other than his own record. The Mets 
have shown their vulnerability, and the Expos are in contention, something 
Langston has never experienced before. 
</P>
<P>
Now, if it's fantasy you like, that belongs to Joe McIlvaine, who was writing 
the fantasy for the Mets. All winter and all spring McIlvaine, the Mets' vice 
president, thought of the pitching he was going to put together. 
</P>
<P>
"It staggered me," McIlvaine mused Tuesday night. Count 'em: Gooden, Langston, 
Darling, Ojeda, Cone. It suggested the Cleveland Indians of Lemon, Wynn, Feller 
and Garcia or the Orioles of Palmer, McNally, Cuellar and Dobson -- and more. 
</P>
<P>
"We were about as close as you can come to making the deal on a number of 
occasions," McIlvaine said. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners hadn't even tried to sign Langston. He was too good, worth too 
much. They had to make a deal. 
</P>
<P>
Langston saw himself in the rotation in McIlvaine's mind. "That many top 
pitchers; they would push each other to new levels," he said. "If you're a 
competitor, that kind of thing is great. It doesn't mean jealousy." 
</P>
<P>
McIlvaine had determined that Langston had the best lefty promise in the 
American League. He'd pitched for a bad team and in a tiny ballpark, and he'd 
get only better for the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Langston, 28, had five seasons with Seattle. He was an eye-opening left-handed 
pitcher. He has a high kick that brings Warren Spahn to mind. He throws a 
fastball consistently in the 90s, has an outstanding slider and knows how to 
pitch a little bit. He had won 70 games and lost 62. Once he even won 19 games. 
Three times he had the most strikeouts in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
McIlvaine made the well-reported offers of Howard Johnson, Sid Fernandez, David 
West -- the bright pitcher of the farm system -- and their top minor-league 
right-hander, Kevin Tapani. And the Mets wanted a 24-hour window to get 
Langston to agree to an extension of his contract. "I think we could have done 
it," McIlvaine said. 
</P>
<P>
How could the Mariners not go for it? Well, you have to know a little about the 
Mariners, as Langston does. In his five seasons he never saw a sign that owner 
George Argyros would spend a quarter to win anything. Each time the deal was on 
the brink, it was pulled back. 
</P>
<P>
And, as it turned out, the Expos got in with an underbid of three unproven 
pitchers. Langston understands that better than most. "Now the Mariners are 
rebuilding," he said. "They've been rebuilding for 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
McIlvaine said he last talked to Woody Woodward, the former Yankee general 
manger who runs the Mariners as best he can, at 9 p.m. May 24. If Argyros was 
balking at the potential cost of the quartet from the Mets, McIlvaine 
restructured the deal. 
</P>
<P>
"If the truth be known," he said, his last offer was two pitchers from the 
major-league roster. Presumably Fernandez and Roger McDowell or Rick Aguilera 
-- he won't say who. Argyros would save some money. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking there wasn't going to be a trade," McIlvaine said. When he woke 
up the next morning, the Expos, who didn't get into the running until the last 
week, had Langston. The price was Gene Harris, Brian Holman and Randy Johnson 
-- not exactly household names in Montreal, Seattle or New York. 
</P>
<P>
And abruptly the Expos had made a giant leap up to the best in the division. 
"If somebody else in our division had got him, I would have been shocked if we 
had won," Dave Dombrowski, the Expos' young general manager, said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Mariners had a scout at each of the Expos' spring-training games, 
and at the end of camp the scout said, "Dave, I wish you guys had shown some 
interest in Langston." 
</P>
<P>
Forty games into the season the Expos' rotation was getting shaky, and 
Dombrowski, convinced he couldn't get the window of negotiation he also wanted, 
offered the young pitchers the Mariners' scout wanted. And all three came with 
minimum salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Now Langston is looking forward to the challenge of the contender in other 
ways. "I look forward to the pressure," he said. "I want it. I want the chance 
to find out how good I can be. I'll benefit from it. Which situation do you 
like, pitching for first place or being 35 games behind?" 
</P>
<P>
Some players are more effective when the game means nothing. "I want to be part 
of something every time out that means something," he said. "When it's over, 
then I'll think about free agency." 
</P>
<P>
The offers will be staggering. The Expos are counting on Langston finding 
Montreal a pleasant place to play. The organization is ambitious, and he likes 
his teammates. And if he keeps the Expos in the race, maybe the excitement will 
hold him. "If we win here, that's the situation everybody plays for," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now every city and every stadium is a new experience. Almost every batter is. 
But he's noticed that he likes the "leadership" on the Expos. Spike Owen, the 
feisty shortstop "leads with personality." Tim Raines "leads with performance." 
Langston never felt that with Seattle. The Expos already have an edge. 
</P>
<P>
McIlvaine called that "the incumbency advantage." He sounded jealous.

LEYVA GETS CHANCE TO LEAD PHILLIES IN '90S 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Nick Leyva is still listed as the youngest manager in the National League, even 
though the last-place Philadelphia Phillies have aged him considerably this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old rookie manager will be able to afford some Grecian Formula for 
his gray hairs after his contract was extended for another year by General 
Manager Lee Thomas this week. 
</P>
<P>
'I've known all along in my mind that Nick Leyva would be back," Thomas said. 
'I've been very pleased with the job he's done. It was just a matter of finding 
the right time to announce it. We thought about doing it while we were in our 
11-game losing streak, but there seemed to be so many other announcements then. 
This is as good a time as any to announce it." 
</P>
<P>
The occasion was a Veterans Stadium press conference to meet and greet the 
latest arrivals, a result of two trades made Sunday, through the revolving door 
to the Philadelphia clubhouse. Only the fry guys at Burger King and McDonald's 
are fired and hired more often than Phillie pitchers and infielders. 
</P>
<P>
In separate deals, the Phillies acquired three players from the San Francisco 
Giants -- pitchers Terry Mulholland and Dennis Cook and a minor league 
infielder -- and outfielder Lenny Dykstra and pitcher Roger McDowell from the 
Mets. 
</P>
<P>
'I'm excited about it," Leyva said. 'The organization is stepping in the right 
direction. Everybody here realizes our main goal is to try to win as many games 
as we possibly can. 
</P>
<P>
'We've made some major moves. We've changed the nucleus of our ballclub. We've 
gotten more quantity. We needed a change. It's tough when you have to move some 
of your good players to make up for what some of the lesser players have done, 
but that's the way baseball is. I'm really looking forward to turning this 
around." 
</P>
<P>
Leyva wants the role of miracle worker. He wants to be known as 'St. Nick." He 
wants to stick around because he says, 'the best is yet come." 
</P>
<P>
So far, it's been one heartburn after another. 
</P>
<P>
During the 11-game losing streak, Leyva was asked if he kicked his dog when he 
went home at night. 
</P>
<P>
'I don't have a dog," he said. 'But if I did, he'd be dead by now." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the injuries that decimated his pitching staff, despite the disruption 
of the Mike Schmidt retirement, Leyva kept his patience, sanity and sense of 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
'I try to be optimistic. When you come into my office I try to stay upbeat at 
all times even though I do have a few things burning inside. Once in a great 
while I do let them out. Those things will happen, but I try to stay positive 
and show my players that I'm positive, then they become positive," Leyva said. 
</P>
<P>
'You have to give Nick credit for that," Philadelphia outfielder Von Hayes 
said. 'He's been behind us all the way. We appreciate that." 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the announcement of his contract extension had Leyva pumped. 
</P>
<P>
'I feel excited. When you are a first-year manager on a one-year contract you 
have to feel excited about it. We are making the right moves to try and better 
our organization. I feel we really have and I'm glad I'll be a part of it when 
we eventually do turn it around to where we want to be and get these players to 
where they ought to be playing. 
</P>
<P>
'I've made a few mistakes. That comes with the first year on the job," Leyva 
said. 'Overall, I feel I've done a pretty good job. We've gotten as much out of 
some players as we possibly could. We've had a lot of injuries. We had Mike 
Schmidt not playing to his potential and then eventually retiring. We've had a 
tough year. I'm glad we've lived through it and now that we are starting to get 
healthy again we can turn things around and make it respectable. 
</P>
<P>
'The new guys are all bona fide major league players. And guys like that seem 
to come together faster than maybe if you brought in some young rookies. 
They'll take care of each other, believe me. 
</P>
<P>
'My biggest goal is to get us back to respectability. We've gotten a little 
beyond that. It seemed like we weren't able to compete against certain clubs. 
Now I feel with the new arms that we have and the new people in the lineup we 
are a competitive ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
The question and answer session with the new arrivals was the kind of feeling 
out process you see on 'The Dating Game." 
</P>
<P>
Mulholland, one of three Giants acquired Sunday for relief pitcher Steve 
Bedrosian, said, 'It's real good to be here. Growing up (in Uniontown, Pa.) I 
always followed the Pirates because of geographics. Philadelphia was my second 
favorite team and my idol, more or less, was Steve Carlton. So, being here is a 
really good thing." 
</P>
<P>
Center fielder Dykstra, traded from the Mets to the Phillies on Sunday along 
with reliever McDowell for center fielder Juan Samuel, had this to say: 
</P>
<P>
'I was expecting it. I've been expecting it for so long, the expectation kind 
of went away. Then it came back because they were struggling. The way it is in 
New York is that if you're not in first place by 10 games in June, something is 
wrong. They had to do something. It's something the club needed, to be honest, 
and they needed a right-handed hitter. 
</P>
<P>
'I knew the person to go would be me. I'm not sad about that. I helped them win 
a world championship. I knew I was a big part of that, but I also knew it was 
time to move on. In my heart, I want to know what I can do. I was tired of 
going to the park and looking at the lineup to see if I was in there. I'm going 
to prove to people what I can do. It might not happen real quick this year 
because I haven't faced lefties consistently in a long time. 
</P>
<P>
'... I'm not saying anything bad about the players that were traded. Juan 
Samuel has many offensive weapons, but the Phillies finished last with Juan 
Samuel. I'm not taking anything away from him. He needed a new life and a new 
charge, and I needed the same thing. I'm at the peak and I'm ready to bust. 
It's a good situation and the people in the clubhouse sense that."

COMMENTARY;

<P>
THE PARTING OF HENDERSON AND THE YANKEES WAS LONG OVERDUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GERGEN, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To the end, Rickey Henderson was unpredictable. At a time when the Yankees 
expected the uncertainty of his future to elicit a career year, the man 
suffered from high anxiety. Much to the team's surprise and dismay, it 
developed that he thought too much, not too little. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout his years in the Bronx, Henderson was susceptible to muscle pulls 
and psychic bruises. Healthy and motivated, he was a remarkable offensive 
force. The flesh was strong this season; the spirit no longer was willing. 
</P>
<P>
Teammates and management alike believed that the prospect of a lucrative new 
contract would provide inspiration even greater than the sight of Billy Martin 
in the manager's office. They were wrong. Instead of responding to the 
opportunity, he dwelled on the insecurity. The last season of the five-year 
pact he signed on Dec. 8, 1984, the day he was traded from his hometown team, 
clearly was his worst. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson and the Yankees were trapped in a cycle of their own making. They 
weren't willing to offer the huge long-term guarantee he sought if he didn't 
produce at least as well as in the past. Conversely, he seemed unable to 
perform to that level as long as the Yankees were witholding their financial 
approval. The distraction had an unsettling effect on the player and the 
player's funk certainly wasn't helping the club. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than continue the dance any longer, the Yankees shipped Henderson back 
to Oakland yesterday, more than two weeks before the player's announced 
negotiation deadline. Thus were the locals depleted by the loss of a third 
so-called impact player in eight months. They jettisoned Jack Clark last 
October for the promise of pitching yet unfulfilled. They consigned Dave 
Winfield to the disabled list, perhaps for the duration of the season, after he 
underwent back surgery. And now they have traded Henderson to the best team in 
the American League for relief pitchers Greg Cadaret and Eric Plunk and a young 
leftfielder, Luis Polonia, whose past performance suggests he is capable of 
filling one of Rickey's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
It may have been the only course open to the Yankees once George Steinbrenner 
decided that Henderson was not a rock upon which to rebuild the team. The 
player already had vetoed the notion of a transfer to the National League. 
Henderson's current contract status and his asking price for future 
considerations further restricted options. The A's have been managing quite 
well with a cast of supporting players but Henderson is capable of sending a 
jolt of electricity through a team deprived of Jose Canseco, Walt Weiss and 
Dennis Eckersley. 
</P>
<P>
Even in an indifferent season, Henderson had scored more runs than anyone 
associated with the A's. In the proper frame of mind, he can turn a game with 
his speed, his power or both. Management in Oakland has reason to believe the 
return home and the chance to appear in his first World Series will provide the 
proper mental stimulation. It can't even be called a gamble, not with the 
excess of quality arms in baseball's deepest bullpen. Polonia was a pesky 
leadoff hitter and Oakland's foremost baserunning threat in Canseco's absence. 
He had 13 stolen bases, approximately half of Henderson's total. 
</P>
<P>
No matter if the deal was the best the Yankees could have made under the 
circumstances, it left the offense weakened and the image diminished by another 
star. After Don Mattingly, the one true Yankee, and hustling import Steve Sax, 
where is the attraction? Furthermore, the pitching staff still is without an 
ace or a dependable rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are they weren't going to win in the American League East, even with 
Henderson at the top of his game. But the man was worth the price of admission 
at such times. He will surpass Lou Brock's career record for stolen bases 
perhaps as soon as next season. Off-year or not, he trailed the league leader 
in steals by one on the day of the trade. He led the AL in walks and his 
on-base percentage was among the best in baseball. And he's still only 30. 
</P>
<P>
The man could be exasperating. Remember how in the wake of the one-game strike 
a few years back he was caught unawares and unconcerned back in Oakland? 
Although there was a new manager and coaching staff in place this spring, he 
took his own sweet time in reporting to training camp. Once there, he angered 
teammates by affixing blame for the disappointment of 1988 on the alcoholic 
state of unnamed Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, there was the celebrated problem with his hamstring. He called 
it a "hammy" and virtually accorded it a life of its own. When Lou Piniella 
fumed at the amount of time Henderson was spending in the whirlpool instead of 
leftfield, Steinbrenner publicly aired his manager's dissatisfaction in a fit 
of pique, effectively undermining Piniella and sabotaging his own team. And so 
it went. 
</P>
<P>
That particular incident was the source of Henderson's most memorable line, at 
least as recorded by these ears. When the Yankees returned from a road trip, 
Henderson walked into the manager's office and the two had a long private 
conversation. Upon emerging, the outfielder said there was no hostility between 
him and the manager, that they understood each other. His philosophy, Henderson 
concluded, was to "let bye-byes be bye-byes." 
</P>
<P>
I thought of that yesterday and I had to smile. Piniella has become too 
valuable a front-office utility player for the organization to consider letting 
him manage again, here or in Toronto. And now Henderson is headed back to 
Oakland for a package that includes one of the five young players it took to 
complete the trade for Henderson five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
So long, Rickey. Au revoir, hammy. And by all means, let bye-byes be bye-byes.

MORNINGSIDE GIRLS ADVANCE IN BASKETBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The girls basketball team from defending state Division I champion Morningside 
High School may be the most talented group in California and because four 
starters return, big things are expected from the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside is living up to those expectations in the 22nd L.A. Games. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday morning at El Camino, Morningside proved it is still the team to beat 
by defeating Division III champion Brea-Olinda, 42-35, in the quarterfinals of 
the 64-team girls tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs advance to the semifinal round against Lynwood today at 9 a.m. The 
championship will be played later this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone on this team is bound to improve, and I don't see anyone out there 
stopping us if we play up to our capabilities," said Morningside's All-American 
center Lisa Leslie, who was recently named to the Junior National team after 
tryouts in Colorado Springs, Colo. "I think we'll be even better once the 
season starts and we start getting back into our rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
However, if there is one kink in the Morningside armor, it is the absence of 
point guard JoJo Witherspoon, who graduated and moved on to play at the 
University of Kansas. Witherspoon was a catalyst on offense and Morningside's 
best defensive player. Monarchs Coach Frank Scott has asked sophomore Sherell 
Young and junior Princess Murray to step into Witherspoon's spot, but it is a 
considerable request. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now it (Witherspoon's graduation) is affecting us a lot," Scott said. 
"She was a great defensive player, she was probably the quickest guard in 
California and she pushed the ball upcourt for us." 
</P>
<P>
Against Brea-Olinda, Murray scored six points, but Young was held scoreless. 
The Monarchs also had trouble bringing the ball upcourt, committing 21 
turnovers, including 14 in the second half when Brea-Olinda cut Morningside's 
14-point lead to 3 with 2 minutes left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside has 6-foot-1 forward Janet Davis, who started every game last year 
as a freshman. Davis scored 10 points Saturday, yanked down nine rebounds and 
blocked four shots. 
</P>
<P>
But when it counts, Morningside still has the 6-foot-5 Leslie, who is probably 
California's best basketball player. She led all scorers with 17 points, 19 
rebounds and six blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
After scoring 12 points in the first half, Leslie was silent for the first 18 
minutes of the second frame when Brea-Olinda, trailing 31-17, cut the 
Morningside lead to 35-32 with 2:10 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
In the next 20 seconds, Leslie took over. She drove the lane for a layup, was 
fouled and converted the free throw for a three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
On the other end of the court, Leslie blocked Tammy Blackburn's shot, grabbed 
the loose ball and fired a pass to Akiba Flanagan, whose shot rolled off the 
rim. Leslie got the rebound, was fouled and made both shots to give the 
Monarchs a more comfortable 40-32 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing we have to do is get our confidence level back up," Leslie 
said. "And then we have to keep getting more intense on defense. If we keep 
playing hard, giving 110%, we'll be all right. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the fact that we're playing well together as a team and the defense is 
hanging in there." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie goes to Colorado Springs in two weeks and will join her Junior National 
teammates on a basketball tour of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. Games kick off the summer basketball season, and Morningside will play 
in three tournaments and in a league in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
But they'll play most of their games without Leslie, Davis, who will attend AAU 
camp in Virginia, and Flanagan, who along with Witherspoon will participate in 
team handball at the National Sports Festival in Oklahoma City next month. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what the summer is all about," Scott said. "You get a chance to see 
what you need to work on and see how your youngsters can perform." 
</P>
<P>
In other sports action: 
</P>
<P>
Two of three South Bay teams advanced in the early basketball games Saturday 
only to be eliminated later in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Carson dumped Marina of Huntington Beach, 52-37, Saturday morning at Locke 
High, but was beaten by Lynwood, 56-54, in the later game. In its first game of 
the day Lynwood beat Westchester, 61-57, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Also at Locke, Rolling Hills, which beat Camarillo, 62-48, Saturday morning, 
lost to Dorsey, 63-51, in the afternoon round. 
</P>
<P>
Two South Bay teams will face each other this morning in the passing football 
semifinals at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
North Torrance squeaked by Bellflower, 20-19, and earned the right to face 
Westchester, which beat L.A. Baptist, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Muir beat West Torrance, 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
West Torrance advanced to today's softball championship game with a 5-1 victory 
over Hart of Newhall. The Warriors face Thousand Oaks, which beat Rolling 
Hills, 7-6, in a game that was decided by two tiebreakers.

WHITE WINS SAUGUS RACE HANDS DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Dale White Jr. kept his bumpers and fenders to himself and raced like a good 
little Street Stock driver Saturday night for 25 of the most crunching laps 
this season at Saugus Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
Reprimanded by track officials after purposely ramming another driver's car at 
the finish of a heat race, White, of Simi Valley, was given an ultimatum before 
the main event. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to drive clean," White said. "They were going to send me home. They 
said, 'No touching anybody, keep your hands off everybody.' So, I said, 'OK, I 
will.' " 
</P>
<P>
So, while the race featured three yellow and one red flags, White rallied 
without incident from a 12th-place start to claim his third oval main-event 
victory of the season before 3,506 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
Four drivers held the lead and a total of seven held a position among the top 
four. Consequently, courteous driving was nowhere to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
"On that last lap," White said, "I could see that (Craig) Rayburn and (Russ) 
Beckers were smacking each other around, so I had an open lane and just went 
for it. It was just a matter of waiting." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was on Lap 21 that White roared past leader Eric Foster of North 
Hollywood, who had overtaken Kenny Wilson of West Hills just one lap earlier 
with an impressive outside pass through Turns 3 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
After grabbing the lead on the second lap and resisting hard charges by White 
and Larry Durm of Northridge, the race seemingly was Wilson's to lose -- which 
he did, along with a rear wheel, while Foster was making his outside pass. 
</P>
<P>
A similar fate awaited Foster, who pulled out of the race less than a lap later 
with a shredded tire. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a flat tire right when I made the pass," Foster said. "I'm a little 
upset. That would have been my first oval main-event win ever. There was a 
lotta bumpin' in the front, but I wasn't doing any." 
</P>
<P>
Foster, however, reappeared for the 15-lap figure 8 main event and finished 
ahead of White for his first main-event win of the season. Jim Marlewski of 
Simi Valley finished third and Rayburn finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
The evening also featured the second appearance this season by U. S. Auto Club 
Midgets. Wally Pankratz of Yorba Linda won the 30-lap main event ahead of 
Sleepy Tripp of Costa Mesa, who won a heat race and the trophy dash. 
</P>
<P>
In the 20-lap three-quarter Midget main event, Steve Kellick of Bakersfield 
slipped past pole-sitter Mike Perine of Camarillo on Lap 5 and raced 
unchallenged to the checkered flag. 
</P>
<P>
George Ito of Ventura finished second and Kara Hendrick of Chino took third. 
</P>
<P>
In other races, Frank Pedregon of Gardena won the six-lap Midget semi-main 
event ahead of Stephen Lewis of Bakersfield to advance to the main event. 
</P>
<P>
Ten-lap Midget heat race winners included Tripp and Chuck West of Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Kellick and Scott Hansen of Simi Valley each won eight-lap, three-quarter 
Midget heat races. 
</P>
<P>
Eight-lap Street Stock oval heat race winners included Jeff Drake of Fillmore, 
Marlewski and Beckers, of Sepulveda. Rayburn of Simi Valley won the eight-lap 
Street Stock figure 8 heat race. 
</P>
<P>
Trophy dash winners included Tripp (Midget), Hendrick (three-quarter Midget), 
Steve Nickolai of Simi Valley (Street Stock oval) and White (Street Stock 
figure 8).

BYE-BYE BLUEBIRD; 
</P>
<P>
END AT HAND FOR SUN VALLEY FILM SET AND HOME TO AMATEUR BASEBALL TEAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Bluebird Field in Sun Valley was created as a field of dreams, existing only in 
the netherworld of Hollywood make-believe. MTM Enterprises built it in 1983 as 
the home of the "Bay City Blues," a fictitious minor league team and a weekly 
NBC television series bearing the same name. The Blues didn't win very often, 
but the only statistics that really counted were Nielsen ratings. And they were 
bad enough to cause the network to drop the series after only eight episodes. 
</P>
<P>
It was when the series was canceled and MTM packed up its cameras that a 
strange thing happened to Bluebird Field: It came to life. Mission College 
discovered it. So did Village Christian High and other amateur baseball teams. 
Suddenly, a field that was supposed to be imaginary began serving a real 
community -- and a community that had a scarcity of athletic facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"There's really nothing else in this end of the Valley," says Carlotta Tronto, 
athletic director at Mission College. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the field itself is hidden within the industrial jungle that dominates 
much of the northeast Valley. Rising like monuments above the green plywood 
fence in right field are four towering smokestacks. Massive fuel-storage tanks 
sit behind center field and bulldozers lurk beyond the wall in left. The field 
and almost everything else on the horizon are part of the 153-acre Valley 
Generating Station, which belongs to the Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
For the past six years, the DWP has let teams use the field at no charge in 
exchange for them keeping it maintained. The relationship has been mutually 
beneficial -- the teams get a much-needed, first-rate field and the DWP gets 
its grounds weeded and manicured. But the arrangement has come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
Like the monster that ate Cleveland, the bulldozers will soon devour Bluebird 
Field. The field, the dugouts and the backstop, along with the fake stands, 
will be leveled to make way for a new DWP maintenance facility. And the teams 
are all scrambling to find an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where we'll go," says David Wilson, principal at Village 
Christian. Tronto has a better idea where Mission is going. "To hell in a hand 
basket," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Bluebird Field is scheduled to be destroyed July 1, breaking the hearts of 
young men and -- who knows? -- nipping the careers of potential Orel 
Hershisers. But can it be saved? Is anybody trying? 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to stop the demolition," says Dean Brassfield, manager of the 
California Baseball Assn. Yankees at Bluebird. "But it's part of a master plan. 
There's nothing we could have done." 
</P>
<P>
Is this the case of a heartless DWP cutting off the power, throwing tenants out 
on the street, making a bunch of kids homeless? 
</P>
<P>
"We can't be upset with the DWP," Wilson says. "After all, they let us use it 
for all these years." 
</P>
<P>
And Tronto says, "They did everything they could to find another site for their 
construction." 
</P>
<P>
Ted McGillis, assistant chief real estate officer at the DWP, expressed relief 
that the giant utilities company wasn't being portrayed as a Simon Legree. 
"It's nice those people would say that about us," he says, explaining further: 
"We felt the set was deteriorating quickly and probably wasn't going to last 
much longer. And that land was just essential for what's being built there." 
</P>
<P>
Mission College, which has no campus, much less any athletic facilities, is 
probably in the biggest quandary. But Village Christian has room to build a 
field, and the DWP is donating Bluebird's eight sets of lights to the school. 
</P>
<P>
Before it joins the ranks of Ebbets Field and Forbes Field, Bluebird will be 
immortalized once again on celluloid ("Brewster's Millions" was shot there in 
1985.). An independent production company called Bullpen Ltd. is using the 
field as the set for its baseball film "One Cup of Coffee." The filming, which 
is under way, has to be completed a day before the bulldozers go to work. 
</P>
<P>
On the set, director Robin Armstrong is finishing a scene in which a fight 
takes place in the dugout of the "Tri-City Steamers," a team in the Class D 
League. A makeup artist is applying fake blood to the nose of an actor and 
other actors are getting their faces sprayed with water to simulate sweat. The 
story, which takes place in 1959 in a mythical Central California town, is a 
"human-relationship drama about an over-the-hill ballplayer who isn't prepared 
for or (doesn't see) the end coming," producer Eric Tynan Young says. 
</P>
<P>
Bluebird Field was perfect as the shabby minor league stadium of a down-and-out 
team, Young says. "Those smokestacks? We put them up," he jokes. Young did have 
to make cosmetic changes. He put in a press box, added stands and painted the 
overhang and backdrop a rust color. He also planted grass around the outside of 
the diamond and erected phony billboards along the outfield wall. 
</P>
<P>
"The bulldozers are out there waiting for us like vultures," says Young, who 
had to revise his shooting schedule when the DWP set July 1 as D-Day. 
</P>
<P>
In making Bluebird a field of dreams again, Hollywood worked its usual 
deceptions. The dimensions of the field are painted on the outfield walls: 323 
feet down the lines, 376 to center. But the actual dimensions are much smaller 
-- about 290 feet down the lines, considered too short for junior colleges like 
Mission. But audiences won't know the difference: The camera will make the 
distances seem legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
And to make the baseball action authentic, Young hired as technical advisers 
ex-major league pitcher Geoff Zahn along with Thousand Oaks High assistant 
coach Chuck Fick and Joey Banks, son of former Chicago Cubs great Ernie Banks. 
Their responsibility, Zahn says, taking a bite of an apple in the dugout, is 
"to make the actors look like they know what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
Fick and Banks, both actors, were players on the "Bay City Blues," and Fick 
remembers the field "being built in a heartbeat -- the sod was just laid on top 
of the ground. But it was a great field for high school teams. It's too bad the 
schools around here don't have a place to play." But that's reality these days, 
he adds. 
</P>
<P>
"If a company has a piece of empty land around here," he says ruefully, "they 
either put condos on it or a commercial building."

NEWHALL-SAUGUS' OFFENSE AWAKENS IN 10-2 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE GLAZE, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All Panorama City Coach Scott Smith had hoped for going into Saturday's 
American Legion District 20 game against Newhall-Saugus was to hang onto the 
lead in the Eastern Division. What he did not expect, however, was a shelling 
from what could have been the battleship New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Newhall-Saugus, the Northern Division leader, banged out 16 hits and made good 
use of the 340-foot fence in left-center field, over which it directed four 
home runs in a 10-2 victory at Saugus High. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe that," Smith said. "Our pitchers are super. This is the 
first time we've been hit hard." 
</P>
<P>
Roger Salkeld, better known for the rockets he delivers with his arm, launched 
one with his bat to start the fireworks Saturday. With his team leading, 4-2, 
in the third inning, Salkeld belted a two-run home run. Two batters later, John 
Lopata's solo blast gave Newhall-Saugus a 7-2 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Anderson teed off on relief pitcher Carlos Concha's first pitch in the 
sixth and Corey Byars' two-run, eighth-inning home run made the score 10-2. 
</P>
<P>
According to Newhall-Saugus Coach Tom Pedersen, his team is breaking out of a 
shell. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a good-hitting team", he said. "We've been in a hitting slump the past 
two weeks. I was pleased. It takes some of the pressure off the defense." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon High right-hander Scott Thomason went the distance for Newhall-Saugus, 
scattering eight hits and recording seven strikeouts while yielding only an 
unearned run. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to have a pitcher that you know can go all the way," Pedersen said. 
"He doesn't get tired." 
</P>
<P>
Panorama City took a short-lived 2-1 lead in the third on an error and 
consecutive hits. 
</P>
<P>
Davy Garcia reached first on a throwing error and Shane Wight singled to left, 
sending Garcia to third. Garcia scored on a wild pitch as Wight went to second. 
Joe Cascione followed with a double to the center-field fence off Thomason, 
scoring Wight.

MIRA COSTA HIGH NAMES NEW FOOTBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Petrill, a former assistant coach at El Camino College and San Jose 
State, has been named head football coach at Mira Costa High, the school 
announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Petrill succeeds Dave Brown, who was not rehired by the South Bay Union High 
School District after guiding the Mustangs to a 1-9 record in his one season as 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
Petrill was the defensive coordinator at El Camino under former Coach Jack 
Reilly and was the defensive back coach at San Jose State for three years. He 
has not coached during the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really thrilled about hiring Larry Petrill," Mira Costa Athletic 
Director Herb Hinsche said. "He's a tremendous coach and a tremendous role 
model for kids." 
</P>
<P>
Hinsche and Petrill were assistant coaches together at Aviation High under Ron 
Veres. 
</P>
<P>
A South Bay native, Petrill attended Morningside High and went on to play 
football at El Camino and USC. He was the Athlete of the Year at El Camino in 
1965 and played nose guard for USC in the 1967 Rose Bowl game. ROB FERNAS

COMEBACK TRAIL FOR POLL, GARCIA LEADS TO COUNTRY CLUB MATCH-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Both Jesus Poll and George Garcia were used to traveling the high road. Then 
both found themselves faced with unexpected detours. Scrambling to get back on 
the comeback trail, the two now find themselves on a collision course. 
</P>
<P>
Poll, a super bantamweight fighting out of North Hollywood, was unbeaten until 
two months ago when he was stopped in the 10th round of a World Boxing Assn. 
title fight at the Forum by champion Juan Jose Estrada of Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia, of Westminster, once held both the state bantam and super-bantamweight 
titles concurrently. But after losing to Frankie Duarte in 1986, he quit the 
ring for three years before returning last month to win an eight-round decision 
over Joe Orewa, the African super-bantamweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
Poll (19-1-2, four knockouts) and Garcia (25-4-2, nine knockouts) will now face 
each other Tuesday night in the 10-round main event at The Country Club in 
Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the card will be the unbeaten Ruelas brothers, both fighting 
six-rounders. 
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Ruelas, a North Hollywood featherweight, will be in the ring for the 
second time in 11 days. He is coming off a first-round knockout of Antonio 
Masin in Houston. Ruelas (12-0) has seven knockouts and all have come in the 
first round. His opponent Tuesday will be Francisco Pascasio (10-2, 10 
knockouts), a Mexican now living in Phoenix, who will be making his debut in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Ruelas (6-0, four knockouts) also fought in Houston 11 days ago, 
stopping Benito Rodriguez on a third-round knockout. Tuesday, the North 
Hollywood super bantamweight will face Porfirio Guzman (4-4, two knockouts) of 
Tucson. In other preliminary fights, middleweight Ron Wiswell (4-11-1, two 
knockouts) of Bakersfield will face Robert Carson (5-1-2, three knockouts) of 
Santa Monica in a six-rounder; and middleweight Steve Nickson (0-3) of Hobbs, 
N. M., will be opposed by Vince Wilkerson (1-5) of Los Angeles in a 
four-rounder.

Despite finishing third in Saturday's sixth stage of the Washington Trust 
Classic, John Tomac of Chatsworth dropped to 11th place in the five-day bicycle 
race in Spokane, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Tomac, who started the day 10th overall, completed the 34-mile criterium 
through Manito Park in 1 hour, 4 minutes, 58 seconds. However, time bonuses 
moved second-place finisher David Farmer past Tomac into 10th place overall.

DIGEST: TAFT BASKETBALL PLAYER ENROLLS AT CLEVELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Kenny Collins, the junior varsity most valuable player of the North Valley 
League last season, has transferred to Cleveland High from Taft, leaving behind 
a disappointed basketball coach in Jim Woodard. 
</P>
<P>
Collins averaged 17.5 points and eight assists for the Toreadors as a sophomore 
point guard on the junior varsity and is a potential Division I player at the 
collegiate level, Woodard said. Woodard promoted him to the varsity at the end 
of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
"Kenny is quick, shoots the ball well and handles the ball well," Woodard said. 
"This changes our whole team. But I'm doubly disappointed because he was a good 
kid. He is hard-working, a good student and a good practice kid." 
</P>
<P>
The news came as a surprise to Woodard, who learned of the transfer Wednesday. 
Collins, 5-foot-11, played for Taft over the weekend in the L. A. Games. 
</P>
<P>
The move might help to strengthen Cleveland's status as the Valley-area's top 
program. The Cavaliers were The Times' top-rated team in the area last season 
and sent four players to Division I schools on scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Collins' transfer follows Coach Bob Braswell's resignation to become an 
assistant coach at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura assistant Gary Gray has been promoted to head coach of the baseball 
team, replacing John Crow, the school's new athletic director. Crow's teams won 
two Frontier League titles in four years, including the 1989 championship with 
a 9-1 record (14-8 overall). 
</P>
<P>
Gray assisted Crow for three seasons after coaching at Calabasas for 10 years, 
eight as baseball coach. Calabasas advanced to the playoffs three times but 
never won a Frontier title under Gray. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura lost five players to graduation this spring, including Zac Miller and 
David Aronowitz, who shared the league's MVP award. But all-league players 
Brian Smith and Josh Smaler will be third-year starters on next season's team. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Lofrano, Chatsworth High baseball coach, has landed a summer job as a 
technical adviser to a TV production company that is filming baseball scenes at 
the Chatsworth field. "Hardball" deals with policemen who spend their spare 
time playing baseball. The show will air in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
After Lofrano noticed numerous "errors" in the baseball sequences during a 
recent shooting, he approached a production official who then offered him a 
job. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Lohman of Notre Dame High, the co-most valuable player in the San 
Fernando Valley League, signed a baseball letter of intent with UCLA on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Lohman, an outfielder, batted .472 and drove in 35 runs for the league-champion 
Knights (25-6) this spring. He also had four triples, four home runs and 15 
stolen bases.

IS BIGGER BETTER IN THE MEDIA BUSINESS?; 
</P>
<P>
SOME EXPERTS QUESTION THE WISDOM OF MEGA-MERGER TREND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many big U.S. media companies, acting on the assumption that only giant 
communications concerns will prosper in coming years amid growing international 
competition, have eagerly pursued acquisitions. Time Inc.'s $14-billion offer 
for Warner Communications -- an effort being contested by acquisition-minded 
Paramount Communications -- is only the latest of the big media merger 
proposals. But is bigger really better in the media business? Times researcher 
Melanie Pickett asked some experts for their opinions, and excerpts of their 
comments follow: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Katharine Graham, chairman and chief executive of the Washington Post Co., 
excerpted from a speech given to the San Francisco Advertising Club: 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the importance of size . . . is over-inflated. . . . Labor-intensive 
industries, such as communications, are almost always disadvantaged to some 
degree as they get larger. Still, just because being big doesn't necessarily 
make sense, it doesn't mean that companies are not going to get even larger. 
The competitive urge to grow has never been stronger. The adrenaline is really 
pumping. Human nature has taken over: People want to be big because they want 
to be big. No evidence has ever surfaced that the dinosaurs, even on the brink 
of extinction, wanted to trade places with the cockroaches, who would endure 
for a billion years. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in rigorous management and providing high value to shareholders. But 
I don't believe it should be -- or has to be -- at the expense of fulfilling 
our greater First Amendment responsibilities. . . . If these global companies 
want to take maximum advantage of their distribution channels, they may focus 
more on entertainment at the expense of news. News may even become more 
entertainment oriented. . . . I'm concerned that, as media companies grow in 
size, the desire to make money, achieve power and gratify ego will ultimately 
take precedence over the desire to produce a quality product and contribute to 
the public good, especially if the owners are professional managers far away. . 
. . I'm not against global companies. To some extent we're one, too. But I 
don't believe you have to be a global Goliath to survive in this age . . . no 
popular magazine, no network television affiliate, no dominant daily newspaper, 
nor even a local cable system has failed because it was too small." 
</P>
<P>
Ira Deutchman, a movie producer and director of Independent Features Project 
West, an association that promotes the interests of smaller film makers: 
</P>
<P>
"There's a number of different ways of attacking the movie business. 
Unfortunately, it has always been an expensive hobby. When the average price of 
movies is hitting the $15-million mark, and, in fact, many many movies are a 
lot more expensive than that, then being able to be in the position to take 
those kinds risks on a day-in, day-out basis puts you in a position where you 
can't rise or fall on a single film. That's the reason so many independents are 
going under. They've been taking these enormous risks without having the kind 
of cash flow to draw upon to be able to absorb losses in those areas. 
Therefore, the kind of consolidation that's represented by all the new mergers 
and creating all these giant companies is, in point of fact, very good risk 
management. To be able to afford to be in this business for the long haul, that 
is absolutely necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"Over time, it would seem to me that these large conglomerates are going to 
want to increase the number of films they make as well as their shots at 
$100-million films. And that's when it's possible that the right kind of 
management team at one of these conglomerates could create an atmosphere that 
could be incredibly good for independent film makers. . . . Independents have 
been good at finding good niche markets and I would assume those will start to 
emerge." 
</P>
<P>
Victor Navasky, editor of The Nation magazine: 
</P>
<P>
"The bigger they are, the harder they fall. They're just getting in more and 
more trouble, as illustrated by the tragic comedy that's going on right now. 
It's a combination of good, old-fashioned American greed and losing sight of 
why they went into the media business in the first place. Henry Luce didn't go 
into that business to acquire other businesses. He went into it because he 
thought he had a way of putting out a magazine that could tell the truth in 
short form every week. Of course, it was his version of the truth. The people 
who came after lost sight of all that. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect that's true in every business. In Hollywood, they thought they had a 
way of entertaining and making some money for doing that, but the vision of the 
founders and the occupation of the successors are very different things. 
Deregulation of the Reagan era is what opened the door to all these things. It 
would have been inconceivable to have these kinds of merger discussions, given 
cable and all the antitrust implications of it, in an era of tough antitrust 
enforcement . . . projections (are) that by the end of the century there will 
be a half dozen companies that will dominate the international communications, 
entertainment, information marketplace globally . . . (That) tends to 
homogenize the culture and doesn't leave a sufficient place for people like the 
rest of us." 
</P>
<P>
Ben Bagdikian, author of "The Media Monopoly" and professor at the UC Berkeley 
Graduate School of Journalism: 
</P>
<P>
"(The result of mergers is) going to be a loss for the public in a number of 
ways. The most important loss is a loss of diversity. There's a loss of 
diversity of ownership but there's also a loss in diversity in the content -- 
there will be fewer choices. (Diversity) is important in the entertainment 
business because it socializes whole generations on what social values are, 
what a desirable personality and social being is. And what it does is narrow 
down those choices to those kinds of depictions . . . that make the most money 
the fastest for the biggest operators. 
</P>
<P>
"The public loses in another way: To have media power is to have political 
power. And one of the things that has happened with the growth of giants in the 
media is that their mechanism for creating their dominant empires has been to 
use huge amounts of debt. And the tax laws have been written so it rewards that 
corporation that has dangerous amounts of debt and shifts the tax burden to 
smaller firms and to individuals. Any one of these chief executives or board 
chairmen who has one of these dominant media corporations can see the President 
of the United States almost any time he or she wants because every political 
person has to be concerned with these giant media companies. And they get 
respectful attention for the things they want. So our business regulations, our 
antitrust laws, our tax laws are very heavily influenced by the desires of 
these very large media companies. And that has a hidden, but very strong 
effect, on the rest of the public." 
</P>
<P>
John Morton, media analyst with Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan: 
</P>
<P>
"Globalization is the new buzzword in the financial community. Whether they 
have to do that (merge), who knows? But probably there are some advantages for 
entertainment companies, companies that depend on programming of one kind or 
another, to being bigger. For the kinds of companies I follow, which are 
basically newspaper companies, it probably doesn't make much sense. You don't 
see any of the big newspaper companies getting excited about globalization and, 
in fact, in a couple of instances, have vowed not to. I'm not so sure whether 
going after global markets is the major motivation here. The major motivation 
is to make money and to accumulate assets." 
</P>
<P>
Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.: 
</P>
<P>
"Hell, no. They've done such a great PR job promoting this American flag 
draping. And if you look at it, there really aren't that many synergies between 
a Time and a Warner. Somebody had a great field day sitting down and coming up 
with all these ideas of what they can do together. Case in point: Time and 
Warner say, 'well, we can sell advertising across the media lines.' The problem 
is, you have different media buyers. How are you going to do that? That 
requires almost a change in the structure of advertising. And I'm not sure 
they're going to do that just for Time-Warner or Time-Paramount even. . . . 
Whoever comes out winning Time, and I think Time is going to somebody, is going 
to have a hell of a lot of debt and a completely different financial structure 
than they had going in. That doesn't necessarily mean they're unhealthy, but 
they are certainly changed."

In your story on the "most memorable" ads ("Lingering Scent," May 24), I 
noticed where Camel cigarettes was mentioned for its cartoon character. 
</P>
<P>
The R. J. Reynolds spokeswoman, Maura Payne, claims that "we took extra pains 
to make sure that he appealed to adults, not children." 
</P>
<P>
If what Payne says is true, why have I observed so many young children wearing 
small T-shirts with the cartoon camel in front? Who do they think they are 
kidding?

ALICE KAHN: A FEW TIPS FOR ENTERING NEW WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alice Kahn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boys and girls, men and women, guys and dolls, straights and gays, people of 
color and bland people, abled people, disabled people and those too lazy to 
work for a living, amigos and bubbelehs, artsy types and rip-off artists, 
avowed communists and Satanic cultists, atheists and crystal healers, feminists 
and misogynists, libertarians and vegetarians, computer hackers and hack 
writers, trendies and nerds, Deadheads and skinheads, sadists, masochists and 
those caught in the middle: 
</P>
<P>
Here in the United States, diversity is our most important product. We used to 
make cars and clothes and steel, but now we leave that to other, less 
interesting people. 
</P>
<P>
You have asked me to speak today because you hope I will help you make sense of 
the world. You hope I will use wit and humor, yet make a meaningful point. But 
I will not use wit and humor, and I will not make sense of the world. My point 
here is that betrayal is a basic fact of life. 
</P>
<P>
You have heard a lot about how my generation from the '60s is different from 
your generation in the '80s, how we wanted to save the Earth while you only 
want to save yourselves. Some of you were burdened by your parents with names 
like Sunshine and Rainbow and Jennifer that you've had to change to John and 
Jim and Jenny P. 
</P>
<P>
Well, I'm here to tell you it's OK. I want to validate your existence. I'll 
also validate your parking without violating your space. 
</P>
<P>
As a graduate of this high school, you have earned the right to call yourself a 
high school graduate, with all the rights and prestige that infers. But with 
rights come responsibilities. In a few years, you will be old enough to drink 
-- but will it still taste as good? Soon, you will be able to cross state lines 
-- but can you think of a reason why? Soon, you will get to vote for the people 
who run this country. Then you can share in that great democratic experience 
known as regret. 
</P>
<P>
As you go forth, you are probably worried about the spread of sexually 
transmitted diseases. And if you weren't worried about it, we have tried our 
best to remind you of it every day these past four years. 
</P>
<P>
In my generation, we believed in sexual liberation. "Make love, not war" -- 
that was our slogan. We had festivals and human be-ins where people danced 
uninhibitedly in nothing but their head bands and love beads. But it wasn't 
really that great. Some of them had terrible bodies, and were really awful 
dancers. So don't feel you missed anything. Technology has provided safe 
alternatives for your generation, such as phone machines, computers and good 
fax. 
</P>
<P>
After graduation, some of you will enter college. Others will enter the 
economy. And some of you will refuse to leave your room. 
</P>
<P>
Those who go quietly will find a time of peace and prosperity, but there are 
uncertainties in the economy. Some of you are probably wondering where to put 
your money should you be fortunate enough to earn any. I would recommend a 
balanced portfolio -- some blue chip stocks, a mutual fund, a small amount of 
cash and a few close friends in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
I know that graduation speakers are supposed to exhort the young to solve the 
problems of their time. So I would encourage you to make sacrifices, to forgo 
personal wealth, to have a career in public service -- to be the next Jim 
Wright or John Tower. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I hope I haven't left you with the impression that I'm negative about the 
future. Actually, I feel the future looks much brighter because you are in it. 
If my generation taught me anything, it's this: Beware of world savers. Also, 
don't follow leaders, and look out for parking meters. 
</P>
<P>
Those of you who were named Dylan will know what I'm talking about. 
</P>
<P>
What I do hope is that each of you will find yourself a little job, get 
yourself a little place to call home and find somebody to love. It really isn't 
all that complicated. Then you'll wake up and hear the birds singing and see 
the sun rising and smell the roses blooming. Create your own world and you'll 
have one worth saving.

READERS TELL HOW THEY BOUGHT FIRST HOMES; 
</P>
<P>
GETTING IN: A FOLLOW-UP REPORT ON HOW TO BUY A FIRST HOME IN TODAY'S TIGHT REAL 
ESTATE MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When we published our special report last month on buying a first home, we 
asked you to tell us how you bought your first house -- and did you ever. 
</P>
<P>
The Times received dozens of responses from readers across the Southland, some 
of which appear below. By and large, most of the letter writers did exactly 
what the experts in the article advised today's would-be buyers to do: 
</P>
<P>
Scrimp and save to raise a down payment and don't expect to get a "dream home" 
the first time out. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the readers who wrote say they made compromises to buy their first 
home. Some purchased "fixer-uppers," others bought lower-priced condominiums 
and a few even weathered the often-frustrating process of buying foreclosures. 
</P>
<P>
A few bought their first home utilizing more offbeat methods. One purchased a 
house with a co-worker nearly four years ago, and they are still sharing the 
home today. A married couple borrowed money against their life insurance 
policies to help with the down payment. 
</P>
<P>
But some things never change: About half the letter writers said they got at 
least some of the money for their down payment from their parents. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a sampling of helpful advice from readers to readers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Editors 
</P>
<P>
My wife, a registered nurse, and I, a loan officer, bought our first home in 
December of 1985 in Pico Rivera in a new tract. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 225 homes, averaging 1,473 square feet. The houses were being 
sold at $132,000. We only put in 5% down plus closing cost; our total cash out 
was $12,500. Our loan amount was $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
Although our housing ratio was acceptable, our total debt ratio was high due to 
the fact we were paying for two cars. The loan officer suggested that we could 
still qualify if we had another co-borrower. My wife had a college classmate 
who was single and also a registered nurse. With her as additional co-borrower 
we easily qualified for a $125,000, 30-year loan graduated payment mortgage 
(GPM). 
</P>
<P>
Our down payment was borrowed from my brother, who executed a gift letter. A 
couple of months after the loan closed I prepared a quitclaim deed, which was 
signed by our co-borrower friend. After recording the same with the County 
Recorder, my wife and I are the only title holders on record. Homes in our 
tract are now listed at $225,000. We repaid the borrowed down payment from a 
tax refund. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
I saved for years before finally purchasing my own home. And, like many young 
people starting out, I looked at condos and townhouses, but I managed to get a 
single-family home. 
</P>
<P>
I'm single and have worked in the financial services industry for five years. 
As each year went by, my savings grew, but I felt like I was continually 
falling behind in the real estate market. Finally, I decided now is the time -- 
regardless of what type of property that I could afford. I was already late 
getting into the home buying game, and if I waited much longer, I wouldn't even 
be eligible to play! 
</P>
<P>
I recommend to any first-time home buyer: 
</P>
<P>
1. Do the dirty work. Save for the down payment or find one of those 
equity-sharing deals or whatever it takes to make such a large investment. I 
took advantage of my employee loan benefits program (no points, discounted 
interest rate, etc.) and some help with the down payment from my family. 
</P>
<P>
2. Know why you are buying. What are your priorities? What is most important to 
you and what can you live without? My priorities were investment first, place 
to live second, comforts/extras third. Knowing your priorities can be 
invaluable in helping you make your final decision -- because compromise is 
inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
3. Prepare yourself psychologically as well as financially to buy. It's a gutsy 
move that shouldn't be taken lightly, but in today's market "He who hesitates 
is lost." 
</P>
<P>
4. Get a good agent. Mine was tops. Her name is Karen O'Connell, and I would 
recommend her to anyone looking for a single-family home in the Glendale/La 
Crescenta area. I think the good agents rely on referrals and will do their 
best to have long-term, happy clients. Tell your agent everything you can about 
what you can afford, what you want and again, what your priorities are. They 
can also help educate you on what the market is doing, what price range is 
realistic. 
</P>
<P>
5. Be patient and keep an open mind. I was patient and it worked. I put in an 
offer, a counteroffer was made and within hours they had already received 
several other higher bids. The offer they accepted from someone else fell 
through, so I resubmitted my offer and they accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Although I was looking for a single-family detached home, my price range 
limited my options. My agent showed me a property way above my price range, but 
it had two older single-family homes (one that I could rent out). This was not 
what I originally had in mind, but this kind of property enabled me to get the 
kind of home I wanted (with the income from the rental helping me qualify for 
the loan). I even got the "extras" that were last on my list of priorities, 
like a Jacuzzi, walk-in closet, built-in storage, attached garage and more. If 
I hadn't kept an open mind, I never would have even looked at this type of 
property.

VA Repossession Was Her First Home 
</P>
<P>
I bought my first home in December, 1977. At that time prices had started 
appreciating. I had a 1-year-old son and lived in an apartment in Inglewood, 
and since rents were going up rapidly, I started house-hunting. Nice homes were 
going for about $45,000, or more. 
</P>
<P>
As that was out of my range, I opted for a good location in SouthWest Los 
Angeles, which was about 10 miles from my job and near my baby-sitter. I bought 
a repossessed home from the VA for the asking price of $32,500, with only a 
$1,000 down payment. 
</P>
<P>
I'm a secretary for an aerospace company and this business is a volatile one, 
therefore opportunities for advancement don't always exist. 
</P>
<P>
I asked a friend what I should do to further my career. He suggested in late 
1981 that I buy more real estate. I decided to take money I had gotten from 
being laid off a couple of years earlier and bought a second home. I moved into 
this home and rented out my first one. 
</P>
<P>
I started taking classes in real estate, including property management. Later 
that year the tenants in my first home moved out. I decided to move back in. 
The second house was in a good enough condition to rent. I simply gave it a 
nice face lift. 
</P>
<P>
Early in 1985, I pulled out equity on my two homes and bought a third home. So 
now I have three single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
In the fall of 1986, since rates were coming down and it was a buyer's market, 
I bought a triplex in which I have two senior citizens and a low-income person 
as tenants. 
</P>
<P>
My recommendation to a person that doesn't have a lot of money is to buy in a 
good location that hasn't appreciated a lot, then either take out equity when 
the area picks up and buy something else or move on. 
</P>
<P>
Also, begin networking with people in the business, such as your local real 
estate salesperson and mortgage bankers. If you feel you would want to pursue 
dealing with income property, acquaint yourself with people in the property 
management field, landlord associations and find out all you can about the 
risks/rewards in this enterprising industry.

Shared Home Cheaper Than Apartment Rent 
</P>
<P>
Here's how I (we) purchased a first house: 
</P>
<P>
A friend at work and I decided to purchase a home together after renting 
separate places. I'm 27 now, he's 29. We closed on the house in December, 1985. 
It is a three-bedroom, two-bath, with a large lot and pool in Rancho Cucamonga. 
Purchase price was $93,500. 
</P>
<P>
We financed with an FHA loan with minimum down, and our total closing costs, 
including the down was $6,900. We paid all the points. The present value of the 
home is $145,000, easily. We are tenants-in-common. The total monthly payment 
is $1,036 PITI (principal, interest, taxes and insurance). 
</P>
<P>
We have a detailed agreement that spells out exactly how equity will be paid 
out in the event one of us wants to leave. It has been 3 1/2 years and all is 
well. 
</P>
<P>
An important point: It is cheaper for either of us to share this house than to 
rent. A one-bedroom apartment rents for about $525 a month. Here we have a 
yard, pool, attached garage, an office and appreciation of about $400 after 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Advice: This plan may not be suited for everyone. There must be trust. It is 
probably better if the buyers aren't best friends.

Strategy Paid Off for Home Acquisition 
</P>
<P>
When my husband and I married in March, 1987, our first priority was buying a 
house. Our annual income at that time was $62,000. We had a savings account of 
about $6,000. Here's our strategy: 
</P>
<P>
1. Live in a "cheap but not awful" apartment. We moved into an apartment that 
we could live in comfortably, although not luxuriously, while we planned to 
save money. Our rent was $800 per month for a two-bedroom apartment (compared 
to $950 we were paying). Therefore, we could put that $150 extra into the 
savings account each month. 
</P>
<P>
2. Increase monthly cash flow. Our monthly debts totaled $550. I refinanced the 
loans through my credit union, secured by the $6,000 savings, for an interest 
rate of 7%. Cash savings per month equaled $300. Add this to the rent savings, 
we were putting $450 a month into savings. We had already been putting away 
$550 a month, so we were now putting $1,000 a month into savings. 
</P>
<P>
3. Put every extra penny into savings. We managed to earn about $11,000 in 
overtime and consultant fees during the year. Some went to lower our credit 
card liabilities, most went into savings. 
</P>
<P>
4. Eradicate credit card balances. Because we wanted to qualify for a loan for 
as much as possible, we made a concerted effort to bring our credit card 
balances to zero. 
</P>
<P>
5. "Borrow" money from folks. Although neither one of our parents could really 
afford to give us money gifts, they did anyway. We got $6,000 total and got 
them to sign the bank's gift letters. We were determined to repay these gifts 
after we got settled -- and we did -- with interest. 
</P>
<P>
6. Borrow against tax-deferred annuities and life insurance policies. The 
tax-deferred annuity made a big difference. We borrowed $5,000 from it, the 
interest and principal we pay back is to ourselves, and the IRS says it only 
needs to be paid back within a "reasonable period of time," which could be 
translated: For a house purchase, you could amortize it over 30 years. We 
borrowed $1,500 from two small life insurance policies but every little bit 
helped. 
</P>
<P>
7. Shop around for loans. The rates, points, terms and up-front fees vary 
considerably. Don't pay PMI! (private mortgage insurance). 
</P>
<P>
8. Get pre-approved. We did this to alleviate any fears of not qualifying for 
sellers, especially since we had only 10% down. 
</P>
<P>
9. Look for "For Sale By Owners." Although we worked with a real estate broker, 
we eventually found our house for sale by owner. We paid $173,000 for it -- but 
had we gone through a broker, it would have easily cost us $190,000. (The 
appraiser told us it was undervalued.) 
</P>
<P>
10. Buy a small house, not a dream house, in a nice neighborhood that you can 
live with. Compromise, that's important. We found an adorable 1,200-square-foot 
Spanish-style house in a nice neighborhood in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
11. If it's your first, put 10% down. Between 10% and 20% down, the monthly 
payment difference isn't that much, and you can't save fast enough to keep up 
with the appreciation for 20% down. Don't let anyone (especially realtors) tell 
you you're wasting your time trying to buy with 10% down. 
</P>
<P>
In sum, hock everything you have to get into anything as soon as possible. 
We've lived in our house exactly one year this month and I am shocked, 
surprised and delighted to say that comparable houses on my street are selling 
for $260,000, $285,000 and the one across the street is on the market for 
$322,000. 
</P>
<P>
The value of our house has increased 50%! Although we cannot afford a larger 
house now, the equity growth will allow us to move within a couple of years or 
to add on a couple of rooms (which is a real possibility since we love our 
neighborhood and neighbors).

Bought First Home While in College 
</P>
<P>
My first home purchase was at age 18 as a college sophomore in San Luis Obispo. 
I had read William Nickerson's book, "How I Turned $1,000 into $1,000,000 in 
Real Estate in My Spare Time," and I was highly motivated to get into real 
estate ownership. 
</P>
<P>
My enthusiasm was somewhat tempered by my realization that the days of $2,000 
"fixer-uppers" mentioned in the book were in the distant past. 
</P>
<P>
Still, with assistance on the down payment from my father, I was able to 
purchase a $39,000 home in 1975. My college roommates paid rent that made the 
mortgage payments. I performed fix-up work on the house, such as new 
landscaping and paint. Upon my graduation in 1978, I was able to sell the house 
for $71,000. 
</P>
<P>
I was tempted to spend the profits on a new sports car, but I resisted the 
temptation and bought another house. I continued to buy cosmetic fixer-uppers, 
fix them up and sell them at a profit. Eventually, we bought our "dream home" 
in Rolling Hills. 
</P>
<P>
My advice for today's potential home buyers is to get into the real estate 
market as soon as possible, possibly during their college years. I would offer 
the following advice: 
</P>
<P>
1. Buy your house in an area that is close to your college. This is important 
so that college and your education maintains as the primary focus. 
</P>
<P>
2. Buy a house that needs cosmetic fixing-up. This housing offers the best 
profit potential, and you won't be too concerned if the place gets dirtied 
during college partying! 
</P>
<P>
3. If necessary, get financial assistance from parents for your college-age 
first home purchase. During this period, all housing costs that would have been 
paid for rental housing can be applied to your first home. 
</P>
<P>
4. Stay in the Southern California real estate market. If you sell your first 
home, buy another. Resist the temptation to cash-out early; don't spend your 
real estate money on fancy cars or consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that the real estate cost cycle in Southern California always 
trends upward and that the 2, 3 or 4 years that you gain by being in the real 
estate market during your college years can be pivotal to your long-term 
Southern California housing goals.

Set a Goal, Bought Directly From Owner 
</P>
<P>
I bought my first home in 1978 at the age of 22. At the time I was living in 
Scottsdale, Ariz. Here's how I did it: 
</P>
<P>
1. Set a goal. I was determined to rid myself of apartment life and made it a 
goal to buy a house within six months. 
</P>
<P>
2. Do "homework." I did a thorough assessment of what I could afford and what 
type of home I desired. This involved evaluating my income, savings, debts, 
knowing what lending institutions required to obtain a loan including ratios, 
documentation, etc. and the types of loans available. 
</P>
<P>
3. The search. I decided to go the "By Owner" route and avoided any involvement 
with real estate brokers. I felt this afforded me a better opportunity to cut a 
deal on a price below the market. I set geographical boundaries where I knew I 
could afford to live and focused my efforts on driving through neighborhoods 
and even asking neighbors if they knew of any homes coming up. 
</P>
<P>
There was a cost for this "by owner" strategy, and that was time. Fortunately, 
I had it and used it to my advantage in scouring neighborhoods. For example, on 
the way to and from work, I would take different routes in areas I liked which 
were in my general price range. 
</P>
<P>
4. The purchase. The "drive around" strategy eventually paid off, because one 
day I noticed a "By Owner" sign. I immediately looked, ended up liking the home 
and made an offer. The home was built in 1953 and needed cosmetic work, but it 
was in a great location, with three bedrooms and two baths. 
</P>
<P>
Since I was the first person who looked, I wanted to be sure the sellers 
wouldn't back out before the contract was signed, so I spent time in getting to 
know them and delivered flowers the next day in appreciation. The contract was 
signed that afternoon at a purchase price of $37,500 (asking was $39,000). Sure 
enough, the next day the sellers informed me that they had a back-up offer for 
$5,000 more. 
</P>
<P>
5. The loan. My goal was to get in with as little down with lower initial 
monthly payments, since I knew I would not be in the home for more than two 
years. It was a starter only. I went through a mortgage broker and got a 90/10 
graduated loan through the government. At the time, I believe it was called an 
FHA 345. My down payment came from savings and the sale of a car that I no 
longer needed.

Moved In With Parents to Save Down Payment 
</P>
<P>
I bought my first home in 1981. To do it, I moved back home with my parents and 
saved the money I was paying on rent. Before I moved home my rent was $425 
(within six months I increased this savings to $500). 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the year, relatives told me of a foreclosure with an 8% 
assumable loan. After contacting the owners, the lender and going through an 
escrow company, I had bought my first home. However, since it was not close to 
my job, I rented the house out. I increased my savings to $600 a month. My 
father requested that I only pay the water bill and encouraged me to save every 
penny I could afford. 
</P>
<P>
Within two years, I was looking for my second house -- I had saved a little 
over $15,000. A realtor showed me apartment conversions, probates and homes in 
areas that I did not feel comfortable with. 
</P>
<P>
Disappointed, I decided to look for a house on my own through the newspapers. 
On my way to look at a HUD house, I passed a corner house, with bay windows, 2 
1/2 large bedrooms, one bath with walk-in shower and the most beautiful 
fireplace that I had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
The realtor turned out to be someone who really wanted to work with me, and 
knowing how much I liked the house, assisted me to qualify for a home loan that 
was a variable at 13.5%. Since then I have refinanced -- fixed rate at 9.5%. 
</P>
<P>
I am single, and a legal secretary for a Fortune 500 company. Owning my own 
property has given me more confidence that with determination, a little 
sacrifice, there is no goal unreachable without a try.

Cleaning and Painting Worth Lower Price 
</P>
<P>
After 10 months' frustration of looking at what seemed to be modified closets 
for $100,000 plus, I purchased my first home in July, 1984. I started out 
looking for a two-bedroom home with a dining room and kitchen eating area. I 
wanted adequate closets and decent-sized rooms. I looked in Arcadia, Sierra 
Madre, Temple City and Monrovia. Nothing I saw came close to my hopes for a 
house. 
</P>
<P>
After five or six months, I started considering condominiums. At least their 
prices were lower, and most were in good condition. Finally, in May, I was 
shown the condo I purchased. It was 5 years old, so in good structural shape. 
The condo needed painting and cleaning; the yard was a mass of weeds. 
Consequently, I was able to buy it for under the asking price and to assume the 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
I had enough money saved to avoid the expense of a second mortgage, and my 
payments are not a burden. $100 worth of paint and supplies and physical labor 
cleaned up all of the neglect. I continue to be delighted with my home, because 
it meets my needs and desires. 
</P>
<P>
Patience (sometimes rough to maintain), a willingness to modify my dreams, good 
advice from my parents and time to clean and paint allowed me to become a 
homeowner.

Borrowed From Folks for Down Payment 
</P>
<P>
After renting for three years we bought our first home in 1975-76 for $40,000. 
We were able to borrow the down payment of $8,000 from my parents. We developed 
our small downstairs storage area into a rental to help with the payments. 
</P>
<P>
After two years we sold this home, bought another for $25,000 more and were 
able at this time, because of increased equity, to pay back my parents' loan in 
full. 
</P>
<P>
But even in our new house we rented out a small room and bath. This really 
helps out on the ladder up. 
</P>
<P>
Now, a few trade-up/fix-up houses and homes later, we own our home in a great 
neighborhood and four other houses in nearby neighborhoods as rental property, 
which we plan to retire on.

Bought Townhouse as Their First Home 
</P>
<P>
When we bought our first home, we had saved a bit over $15,000 as a down, but 
couldn't afford a single-family house, so we bought a townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
This is an excellent way to own your first home. Yet you have to remind people 
that even though there isn't that added payment for home insurance, there is 
the association fee. Ours has risen about $20 since we moved in three years 
ago, which isn't too bad. 
</P>
<P>
Even though we now have about $55,000 in equity, we're having a hard time 
finding a single-family home. It's almost as bad as being first-time buyers! 
With a 2-year-old baby, a dog and cat, we've outgrown our home. Looks as if 
we'll be here for awhile, though. 
</P>
<P>
Houses have become out of our reach! We haven't wanted another condo/townhouse, 
because most don't have a real yard, such as this one. We've sort of given up 
for awhile.

Lived on Wife's Pay to Save His for House 
</P>
<P>
When my wife and I were first married, we lived in her family's apartment 
building. We rented there for two years. My wife is a court reporter and I am a 
police officer. We put ourselves on a very strict budget. 
</P>
<P>
We bought only those things that we really needed. We deposited my entire check 
in the bank and lived off my wife's income. We did this for two years, after 
which we had $25,000 in our savings. 
</P>
<P>
The search was on. We looked for several months. We then bought a nice starter 
home with a $20,000 down payment. After five years we took the equity out and 
bought a home for twice the price of our first home.

BUILDERS LAUNCH DRIVE TO COMBAT CURBS ON GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID M. MYERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The trade group that represents nearly 7,000 California home builders and 
others in the housing industry has launched a $5-million program aimed at 
curbing the slow-growth movement and defeating a possible ballot measure that 
would limit growth statewide. 
</P>
<P>
Realtors, lenders and others involved in the real estate industry are also 
expected to join the program, which was started with little fanfare a few 
months ago by the influential California Building Industry Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The builders hope to eventually assemble a broad-based coalition of business, 
civic and ethnic groups to encourage more growth and promote the positive 
aspects of home building. 
</P>
<P>
While formation of the so-called "Save Our State" program -- nicknamed S.O.S. 
-- is the builder group's most ambitious attempt to address growth issues on a 
statewide basis, it is not the only tool it hopes will stem the slow-growth 
movement in California. 
</P>
<P>
Builders meeting here for the recent Pacific Coast Builders Conference hope 
that a transportation program sewn together by state lawmakers will ease 
California's worsening traffic problems, which developers claim is the No. 1 
cause of most growth-control initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
And on the local level, many individual builders are launching public-relations 
programs to defuse opposition to their projects or suing when they feel they 
have been shortchanged. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want the public to think that we're the bad guys in the black hats," 
said George Cook, the California Building Industry Assn.'s executive officer. 
"We want to show people that growth and development is good, not bad." 
</P>
<P>
Although the builders' new Save Our State program is still in its embryonic 
stages, the trade group has already produced a 10-minute, $20,000 video that 
depicts a television newscast the day after passage of a fictitious statewide 
slow-growth measure. 
</P>
<P>
The slick video features two former journalists -- including Tiiu Leek, 
formerly of Channel 5 in Los Angeles -- anchoring the simulated newscast and 
alternately switching to field correspondents in different parts of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
A reporter in Houston talks about the near-depression Texas suffered when the 
energy business collapsed in the early 1980s, while another reporter in 
Massachusetts talks about the economic devastation caused by the collapse of 
the textile business in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"The inference is clear: If housing gets stopped in California, our economy is 
headed for real trouble," said Ken Becker, who works for the Costa Mesa-based 
public-relations firm that helped to put the tape together. 
</P>
<P>
Becker said the tape has already been shown to hundreds of builders and other 
businesspeople in an effort to garner more support for the program and raise 
the estimated $5 million it will take for builders to get their pro-growth 
message across to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Builders plan to run television commercials, hire a celebrity spokesperson, 
sponsor special events and improve their media-relations program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need for Allies 
</P>
<P>
The ability of builders to form a coalition of various civic, business and 
ethnic groups to promote growth could be the make-or-break factor behind the 
pro-growth program's success, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Recent balloting trends show that the public tends to vote for growth-control 
measures when builders are seen as the sole opponents. But voters are much more 
likely to reject controls when a variety of groups oppose the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
"The broader coalition they build, the better off they'll be," said Bill 
Lawrence, an executive in the Los Angeles office of real estate consultants 
Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
"Builders won't generate much sympathy -- regardless of whether they're correct 
-- if they just come across (to the public) as self-interested land rapers. And 
to a degree, that's how they have came across in the past." 
</P>
<P>
Such a coalition will be needed, builders say, if they are to fend off a 
possible statewide slow-growth measure. Although no such measure is currently 
in the works, developers fret that such a proposal could be put before 
California voters in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transportation Funding 
</P>
<P>
Builders also hope that an agreement on a transportation program hammered out a 
few weeks ago by negotiators for the Legislature and Gov. George Deukmejian 
also will ease slow-growth pressures across California. 
</P>
<P>
The pact calls for $18.5-billion to be spent over the next 10 years to improve 
roads, repair deteriorating freeways and enlarge mass-transit systems. The 
money would be raised through the sale of state-backed bonds and through 
increases in both the gasoline tax and truck-weight fees. 
</P>
<P>
The program is designed to cut urban congestion, a key contributor to the 
slow-growth movement. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't take the initiative and pass a comprehensive transportation 
program, the voters will do it for us (by approving slow-growth initiatives) at 
the ballot box," said Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), chairman of the 
Assembly Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Builders see another benefit to this proposal and others designed to reduce 
congestion: Their passage could put downward pressure on the fees that 
developers now must pay to build roads, schools and other items near their new 
housing tracts. 
</P>
<P>
Such fees can top $10,000 for each new home in a development. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gann Spending Limit 
</P>
<P>
"The public would be shouldering a fairer share of paying for roads," said Don 
V. Collin, a builder lobbyist. "Everybody uses the roads, so everybody should 
pay for them -- not just builders and new home buyers." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the proposal that Katz and his colleagues reached with the governor's 
negotiators has a few obstacles remaining in its path. The two biggest: Voters 
would have to significantly alter the Gann state spending limit and also 
approve $3.5 billion in bond sales. 
</P>
<P>
While the plan is the most far-reaching transportation program the Legislature 
has contemplated in more than two decades, Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin 
(D-Fremont) is formulating a bill that could have an even greater impact on 
statewide growth. 
</P>
<P>
Eastin's plan would set a jobs-to-housing ratio for every area of the state. 
The bill would provide incentives to local governments that encourage the 
development of communities with a good balance of both homes and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Many urban planners say such ratios would enable people to work close to home, 
thus easing traffic congestion, cutting down on smog and curing other problems 
caused by a commuter-oriented society. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Soothing Homeowners 
</P>
<P>
While lawmakers work on long-range solutions to ease the state's growth 
problems, builders are adopting a variety of strategies to cope with growth 
concerns in their own neighborhoods today. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based American Beauty Homes, like many other builders, recently 
hired two full-time public-affairs experts to meet with homeowner groups in 
areas where it wants to build. The company also employs several part-time 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to iron out all the community's concerns first, before we go the city 
and ask for permission to build," said Jack Shine, American Beauty's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paying Premium Prices 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, whether they're known as public-affairs specialists, consultants or 
community-relations experts, people who know how to soothe the nerves of 
homeowners can make big money working for builders. 
</P>
<P>
A recent job opportunity survey conducted by the executive search firm of 
Korn/Ferry International said demand for community-relations specialists in the 
real estate business is outstripping supply. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies are paying premium prices for properties whose current owners 
have already received approval to build a certain number of homes. 
</P>
<P>
"That way, you don't have as many headaches because most of your approvals are 
already in place," said Jim Montgomery, director of land development for 
Irvine-based Barratt American Inc. "Your pre-development time is cut way down 
because you're automatically entitled to build a certain number of units." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Going to Court 
</P>
<P>
However, Montgomery said, such a convenience is not cheap. A parcel with most 
of its approvals in place can cost 50% more than an identical parcel without 
approvals. 
</P>
<P>
Some builders who feel unfairly treated by local growth-control ordinances or 
city officials have also become more willing to seek relief in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Two builders in Orange County, for example, sued the Newport-Mesa Unified 
School District last year over fees the district has been charging developers. 
Although the fees did not exceed state-set limits, the builders felt the 
district was charging more than it really needed to run its educational 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge ruled against the district and recently ordered it to 
refund the $523,000 it had collected from the builders and two local 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was the latest in a string of decisions that has made it tougher for 
municipalities to levy certain types of fees on builders and harder for 
slow-growth advocates to stop planned projects. 
</P>
<P>
"Builders aren't exactly lining up to go to court, but they now have a little 
more legal ammunition if they decide that it's the only thing left for them to 
do," said Ken Bley, a partner in the Los Angeles office of attorneys Cox, 
Castle &amp; Nicholson.

SOUTHLAND HOMES DOMINATE JUDGING FOR 'BEST IN WEST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two of three production homes judged this year's "Best in the West" for their 
design in a competition among home builders are in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
And the condominiums deemed the "Best Affordable Housing" in the 14 Western 
states are in Pacoima, in the San Fernando Valley, at a starting price of 
$71,990. 
</P>
<P>
But it was design -- not price -- that guided the panel of 14 home building and 
design experts who were judges in the "Gold Nugget" competition at the annual 
Pacific Coast Builders Conference, which ended last weekend in San Francisco. 
With 886 entries, the Gold Nugget is the biggest regional competition in the 
nation, said Pete Mayer, judging chairman and producer of the show. 
</P>
<P>
The "Home of the Year" in the detached, small-lot category was a plan at 
Seadrift, a 93-detached-unit project in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Bassenian/Lagoni Architects of Santa Ana, the home has four 
bedrooms, 3 1/2 baths, three fireplaces, a bonus room, about 3,200 square feet 
of interior space and a three-car garage. 
</P>
<P>
Judges, who chose the plan over 137 competitors, applauded the home's "raised, 
angled entry" and "sense of interior spaciousness," particularly for a small 
site. The category in which Seadrift won was for homes built on lots 5,000 
square feet or smaller. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Dann, the marketing director for the builder, A-M Homes of Newport Beach, 
said, "We're reusing that plan a lot, because it has been so successful. It 
sold out in a matter of months." 
</P>
<P>
The whole project sold out within six months of opening, at $50,000 more per 
house than when it opened in April, 1988, she said, but you can still find the 
winning model at two A-M developments. 
</P>
<P>
At Summit Crest in the Orange County community of Dove Canyon, the model is 
selling for $408,000, and at Bellagio in Calabasas Park, it is priced from 
$580,000. "The (price) difference," she explained, "is the cost of the land." 
</P>
<P>
The "Home of the Year" in the attached category is in Blackhorse, a 121-unit 
project in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by architects Lorimer-Case of San Diego, the 2,685-square-foot plan 
has four bedrooms, 2 1/2 baths, French doors, 10-foot-high ceilings, arched 
floor-to-ceiling windows, a circular stairway, skylights and a designer 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Eve Hager, sales and marketing vice president for Davidson Communities of San 
Diego, said the plan has been popular because it is "so open and spacious." 
Judges, who selected the model over 121 other entries, remarked on the "use of 
custom features and attention to project streetscaping." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas Home 
</P>
<P>
There is only one of the winning homes remaining to be sold, she said, and it 
is priced at $594,000, on land leased from the University of California for 65 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The third "Home of the Year," in the detached, conventional lot category, is in 
Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by McLarand, Vasquez &amp; Partners of Costa Mesa, the house, one of 
several for the 120-unit Carmel Series at Spanish Trail, has three bedrooms and 
2 1/2 baths in 2,500 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for its Las Vegas builder, Spanish Trail Associates, said the 
eye-catching feature is a stairway with a bridge overlooking the living room. 
Judges, who chose the plan over 184 other models, called the spiral stairway, 
which can be seen from the entry, "the centerpiece of this home." 
</P>
<P>
There are still 90 units to build, and buyers' preference determines which plan 
is used, the spokesman said. So far, 45% of the units, not 35% as expected, 
have been constructed according to the winning plan. Price varies by lot choice 
from $285,000 to $385,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Best Affordable' 
</P>
<P>
A 324-unit condo development in Pacoima, Glenoaks by Griffin Homes of 
Calabasas, was judged the "best affordable housing" in the West. Chosen from 21 
entries, the honored design was by Paul Essick Architects of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Prices range from $71,990 to $116,900 for units available in the second of four 
phases. 
</P>
<P>
The design calls for two types of condos: some one story, stacked one on top of 
another; some two stories; all with attached garages. Size ranges from 650 to 
1,157 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
"The upstairs, one-story condos have loft areas with lots of light," said Paul 
Griffin III, who is proud of his condo development, but for reasons that go 
beyond its design. 
</P>
<P>
"We do about 1,200 to 1,500 houses (and condos) a year . . . but this is 
different," he said. "It's in a tough neighborhood, and most of our work is not 
building, but working with the community, trying to get young men and women 
there to work on our job site and learn about opportunities in real estate 
development."

URBAN SCENE: WOMEN ARCHITECTS MARK FIRST 100 YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
EXHIBIT CELEBRATES THE PROGRESS OF THE FASTEST-GROWING SEGMENT OF AIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EVELYN De WOLFE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than a century ago, a determined Louise Blanchard Bethune (1856- 1913) of 
Buffalo, N.Y., set out to prove that she could design buildings as well as any 
man. 
</P>
<P>
Before long, Bethune was doing baseball grandstands, factories and schools, and 
in 1888 became the first woman to be admitted to membership in the American 
Institute of Architects. 
</P>
<P>
A traveling exhibit that opened Friday in Pacific Design Center marks that 
100-year milestone and celebrates the progress of women in architecture. 
</P>
<P>
"That Exceptional One: Women in Architecture -- 1888-1989," co-produced by the 
American Architectural Foundation with the cooperation of AIA's Women in 
Architecture Committee, will run through July 31 and then continue on its 
three-year nationwide tour of major cities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heading Local Task Force 
</P>
<P>
Heading the local task force for the exhibit is Kate Diamond of Siegel, Diamond 
Architects in Los Angeles, who at 35, single and "passionately" devoted to her 
career, is typical of a generation of women in architecture who are no longer 
the exception in a traditionally male-dominated profession. 
</P>
<P>
"Our 12-member task force has added a Southern California component to the 
exhibit that is like a snapshot view of where we are and where we've been, 
showing the progress of women architects not only through major accomplishments 
but also less publicized, smaller achievements. 
</P>
<P>
"With some 80 Southern California projects representing the work of 40 women 
architects, we feel the exhibit adds substantially to our credibility both as 
professionals and as role models for young people aspiring to enter the field," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Norma Sklarek, a 1950 graduate of Columbia University who barely squeezed in on 
a minimal quota for female architectural students in the 1940s, has 
distinguished herself not only as the first black woman to be elected to the 
membership of the American Institute of Architects but as the first and only 
woman in its Los Angeles chapter to be elected an AIA Fellow. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not in the most glamorous or visible part of the profession," said the 
new principal at Jon Jerde Architects. "I coordinate the many engineering 
systems in a project." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the progress of her own career, Sklarek said: "I never expected 
life to be easy, but I have found the profession a good one and my male 
colleagues very helpful, actually rooting for me. Being the only woman in the 
firm I first worked for, I was highly visible and I was motivated to be highly 
productive. I had to do more than was expected of me." 
</P>
<P>
The American Institute of Architects reports that women are now the 
fastest-growing segment of AIA membership. With a total membership of 37,277 
registered architects, 1,240 are women. Since 1974, the number of female AIA 
members has grown from 250 to 4,210. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1987-88 academic year, women made up 28% of the enrollments in 
accredited bachelor of architecture programs and accounted for about one-fifth 
of the graduates that year. Women also represented 36% of the full-time master 
degree hopefuls last year, earning 27% of the degrees awarded. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Margo Hebald-Heymann, a 26-year veteran in the profession who heads 
her own firm, was one of five women in a class of 64 when she entered Cornell 
University's School of Architecture, Art and Planning. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an unwritten quota that was quite apparent. Our teachers bluntly 
told us we were wasting our time and theirs as we would surely never follow a 
career after marriage," she said. "For several years, on an average, no more 
than five women applicants were accepted in their freshman year." 
</P>
<P>
Of 16 students in her 1963 graduating class, four of the five women graduated. 
"All are still practicing, all four of us married architects and each couple 
had two children." 
</P>
<P>
Hebald-Heymann said that after she left college, she was the victim of 
stereotyping on several occasions. "There were times when I hired men who were 
interior designers and if I took them out to a job site, invariably some 
contractor would address my male employee as if he were the architect and I the 
interior designer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pivotal Year at Harvard 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Levin, principal of Levin &amp; Associates, Los Angeles, a 1976 graduate 
of the School of Architecture of Harvard's Graduate School of Design, whose 
firm employs six architects, of whom three are women, noted that 1976 was a 
pivotal year in the number of women receiving degrees from that university's 
school of architecture. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was an undergraduate at Carnegie-Mellon in 1964 to 1968, only two women 
were enrolled in architecture. The profession was still perceived as 
male-oriented. But when I graduated from Harvard, the tide had begun to turn 
and 40% of the graduates in architecture were women." 
</P>
<P>
The most frustrating aspect of her career, she said, has been trying to shift 
the perception of her firm. 
</P>
<P>
"We are as equally capable of doing new, large-scale urban projects as other 
firms, but I feel we are handicapped by the overall perception that women 
architects are OK, but on smaller jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the exhibit will have an opportunity to get a historical 
perspective from the work of pioneer architects such as Lutah Marie Riggs, Edla 
Muir, Lillian Rice and the legendary Julia Morgan, the prolific 
turn-of-the-century Bay Area architect was the first woman to graduate from the 
Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. She designed more than 800 buildings in a career 
that lasted until the early '50s. 
</P>
<P>
Women who have contributed to the design of the contemporary environment 
include Rebecca Binder, a recipient of several honor awards from the California 
Council of the American Institute of Architects, and Maya Lin, who as a 
21-year-old Yale University architecture student, submitted the controversial 
prize-winning entry of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington.

NEW DOWNTOWN APARTMENTS AIMED AT AFFLUENT; 
</P>
<P>
BUT SOME BELIEVE SUBSIDY SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
When Phil Allenbaugh moves into his luxury apartment next Sunday on the 
southern edge of downtown Los Angeles, he'll be just the type of upscale 
resident that developers and many city leaders have been hoping to attract to 
the area for years. 
</P>
<P>
A 24-year-old salesman of business forms, Allenbaugh will wake up in the 
morning and take a short walk to call on his clients in the nearby office 
towers. 
</P>
<P>
At night, he'll be able to pop into one of the growing number of trendy 
nightspots in the area before walking back home to The Metropolitan -- a 
14-story high-rise that, come Tuesday, will be the first upscale rental complex 
to open in downtown's fledgling South Park area. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to have an extra 3 1/2 hours a day for myself because I won't have 
to commute from Santa Ana any more," Allenbaugh said. "I'm going to park my car 
in the garage on Sunday night, and not even see it again until the following 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to love living in downtown Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, this week's opening of The Metropolitan will mark a milestone in the 
efforts of Mayor Tom Bradley, the City Council and the Community Redevelopment 
Agency to turn South Park into a bustling neighborhood of both homes and 
commerce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CRA Subsidized Developer 
</P>
<P>
But it will also be a milestone of another sort: A tribute to the frustration 
of some activists for low- and moderate-income families, who say city leaders 
are spending too much time and too much money trying to woo young professionals 
to one of the last bastions of affordable housing in the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
As with several other new or proposed residential and commercial projects in 
South Park, the CRA has provided millions of dollars in subsidies to the 
developer of The Metropolitan. About $10 million of the money that Forest City 
Properties Corp. needed to build the $45-million Metropolitan came from the 
CRA. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just unbelievable that the city is subsidizing developers with millions 
of dollars to lure yuppies downtown," complained Michael Bodaken, a senior 
attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. "This city is the 
homeless capital of the nation. The money ought to be earmarked for homeless 
shelters and low-income housing." 
</P>
<P>
Added David Lara, a community activist at Jobs with Peace: "The big question is 
whether the CRA should be helping to build good apartments for the 
(lower-income) people who already live in the area, or whether they should be 
building upscale housing to attract new residents from other parts of town. The 
Metropolitan won't do anything for the people who already live in South Park, 
because they can't afford the rents." 
</P>
<P>
South Park is roughly bounded by 8th Street on the north, Broadway on the east, 
Santa Monica Freeway on the south and Harbor Freeway on the west. The 
revitalization project has been a source of controversy between city leaders 
and activists such as Bodaken and Lara almost since planning for the area began 
in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spur Private Development 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, city planners and developers hope redevelopment of South Park will 
eventually generate thousands of jobs, millions in tax revenue, and an 
abundance of sorely needed park space and downtown housing. To do that, they 
have committed more than $500 million in taxpayer money to redevelop the area 
and spur more private-sector involvement. 
</P>
<P>
But many activists worry that South Park will become merely a Manhattan-like 
playground where young urban professionals and $1,500-a-month rents will force 
out all but the handful of poor people lucky enough to land one of the few 
subsidized condominiums or apartments slated for the area. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the only other new housing that has been created in South Park is The 
Skyline, an upscale condominium complex that opened about five years ago. It, 
too, was built by Forest City with financial help from the CRA. 
</P>
<P>
"Projects like the Metropolitan are going to gentrify South Park, and the CRA 
is encouraging it," said Bodaken at Legal Aid. "We should be spending the money 
to build affordable housing, not subsidizing apartments for yuppies." 
</P>
<P>
But city officials and developers say skyrocketing land prices in South Park 
virtually mandate public subsidies to build housing downtown, and that 
attracting upscale renters will lure more businesses and builders to the area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Creation of Jobs 
</P>
<P>
"I think the money we got (from the CRA) was money well spent," said Steven P. 
Albert, president of Forest City Properties. "The city and the CRA want to 
create the type of urban environment downtown that you find in New York, London 
and Paris. You do that by building good housing for the people who work there 
and by creating more jobs in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, the city could have spent the money on building all low-income housing 
in South Park. But if they did that, you wouldn't attract more commerce to the 
area and you wouldn't attract upscale housing. If you want to create a real 
community downtown, you have to start with this kind of housing first." 
</P>
<P>
Albert also noted that at least 15% of the 270 apartment units in The 
Metropolitan will be reserved for low- and moderate-income tenants who will pay 
far less than the $690 to $1,435 a month charged for the market-rate units. 
</P>
<P>
"These people are going to live in a much better home than they would if the 
city spent all the money to build a (low-income) housing project in the area," 
Albert said. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Albert's new apartment complex -- already nicknamed "The Met" -- is 
drawing rave reviews from several local architects and city leaders, who say it 
lends some beauty to an area best known for its neglected industrial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Views of Skyline 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Los Angeles-based Dworsky Associates, the building's white 
stucco-and-glass exterior is accented by the green railings that surround each 
apartment's balcony. Mature palms and other huge trees surround the tower, at 
950 S. Flower St., in an effort to create a park-like atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, a two-story atrium sitting area offers views of the city's fast-growing 
skyline. Restaurants and retailers occupy the ground floor of the 14-story 
structure, as well as the street level of an adjacent three-story building that 
is also part of the Metropolitan project. 
</P>
<P>
About 30% of the Metropolitan's 270 apartment units have already been leased, 
and there are more than 200 people on the waiting list to view the remaining 
units, Albert said.

Palms, like tall buildings, make a powerful impression upon the landscape. With 
near-perfect symmetry and almost identical growth habits, they appear more as 
natural sculptures than trees. 
</P>
<P>
Many species will reach monumental proportions within our lifetime, placing an 
enormous responsibility upon anyone wishing to plant one. 
</P>
<P>
How is one to know just where and how to use palms in the landscape? 
</P>
<P>
Landscape architects view the palm as a work of art, a strong form that can be 
used to manipulate spaces. Its characteristics allow it to become an extension 
of architecture, a rigid element that -- like walls or buildings -- can enhance 
an overall concept by carrying it into the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
But these design professionals have an ability to see into the future, to 
imagine the effect of a 30-foot-high column of plant material. The novice must 
learn to have such a vision to understand palm plantings. 
</P>
<P>
In all forms of basic design, a few fundamentals exist. Palms have four major 
uses: lines, groves or bosks, groups and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consistent Growth Habits 
</P>
<P>
Planting palms in lines takes the greatest advantage of their consistent growth 
habits. Typically, the straight-trunked varieties, such as Washingtonia 
filifera and Phoenix canariensis, are selected for avenue planting. 
</P>
<P>
Stemming from agricultural windrow plantings, and even taking inspiration from 
the formal gardens of France, urban planners early in this century knew the 
value of such trees. 
</P>
<P>
An equally stunning design statement can be made on a residential scale. Keep 
in mind that "linear" plantings aren't necessarily straight. They can be laid 
out in beautifully symmetrical arcs as they are at the entry to Newport Center 
in Irvine. They can snake along a pool deck or a curving driveway. 
</P>
<P>
But probably most dramatic are the double rows of palms flanking entry drives, 
with thick trunks and bushy heads creating a visual rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
The use of bosks and groves began in the rigid Moorish gardens of the Middle 
East. A bosk is typically an orchard-like grid planting of feather-fronded 
palms. These varieties might include Canary Island, queen, king and date palms. 
The palms are planted in a grid so that the fronds can grow into canopies and 
provide large areas of shade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Residential Bosks Possible 
</P>
<P>
A small residential bosk might include as few as four palms. The availability 
of matched palms at almost any size today makes bosk planting possible without 
the long-term commitment once necessary. A bosk might be in a paved area, 
possibly with a pattern incorporated into the ground plan. The palms can be 
planted in circular or square openings in the pavement, and a fountain might be 
built at the center. 
</P>
<P>
The bosk can be larger, in a variety of geometric shapes with beds of annual 
color emphasizing the symmetry. So rarely used to its full potential, the bosk 
offers a solution for small urban gardens, where the soft, waving fronds and 
filtered sun, latticework trunks and bright paving extend upbeat interiors to 
the outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
Groups of palms always will suggest the tropics, where the trees grow like 
weeds and seedlings surround the mother plant with thick foliage. These dense 
thickets of green fronds provide a perfect background for colorful plantings, 
lending that hint of exotica. 
</P>
<P>
When designing a garden with clumps or groups of palms, it's important to stick 
with just one or two varieties. Conglomerations of different palms in a dense 
garden environment will dilute the effects of each type. When planting the 
clump, try to incorporate different heights to simulate the natural 
regeneration of the tree. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Select Palms Carefully 
</P>
<P>
For most homes, a single specimen fits the budget and scale of the lot. If only 
one or two palms will be used, take care to select an appropriate variety. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the blue, feather-fronded Butia capitata, while rather expensive, 
is worth the money if it fits your color scheme. King palms, Archontophoenix 
cunninghamiana, can be one of the most decorative, with huge clusters of bright 
red berries and lime-green trunks. 
</P>
<P>
Avoid the Mexican fan palm, Washingtonia robusta, because it soon will grow out 
of sight with a long, spindly trunk. Plant your specimen palms near entries, or 
as a focal point with night lighting. Make them the center of your garden or 
tuck them into patio corners. 
</P>
<P>
The watchword for planting palms is scale. It is important to understand the 
relationship between the palm's ultimate size and the space you plan to put it 
in. Patios will want smaller palms that stay neatly sized or those that grow 
very slowly. Against tall buildings, use tall trees. So often, palms are 
removed because the characteristics of the species were not understood. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that palms are one of the best ways to disguise street lights and 
telephone poles. And, for best results, use companion trees for your palms. 
</P>
<P>
These trees are often used in conjunction with palms due to forms and textures 
that enhance the overall character of the garden. They include but are not 
limited to: Albizzia julibrissin (the silk tree), California pepper, most 
eucalyptuses, standard-size citrus and most ficus trees. 
</P>
<P>
Some available landscape palms: 
</P>
<P>
Fan palms -- California fan palm, Washingtonia filifera; Mexican fan palm, 
Washingtonia robusta; Mexican blue palm, Brahea (Erythea) armata; windmill 
palm, Trachycarpus fortunei; Mediterranean fan palm, Chamerops humilis. 
</P>
<P>
Plume Palm -- Canary Island date palm, Phoenix canariensis; jelly palm, Butia 
Capitata; king palm, Archontophoenix cunninghamiana; thatch or kentia palm, 
Howea forsterana; queen palm, Arecastrum romanzoffianum; Senegal date palm, 
Phoenix reclinata; pygmy date palm, Phoenix robelenii.

DWARF CITRUS TREES CAN DECORATE A PATIO, MAKE A MOVABLE FEAST; 
</P>
<P>
ALTHOUGH SMALL ENOUGH TO BE GROWN IN CONTAINERS, THEY STILL PROVIDE FULL-SIZE 
FRUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
One of the most attractive ways to display the evergreen foliage, fragrant 
blossoms and showy fruit of citrus trees is in containers. Dwarf or semi-dwarf 
varieties are best for containers, providing the same full-size fruit and lush, 
green foliage of standard-size citrus trees. The fruit of most citrus trees can 
be left on the tree for weeks, adding a colorful accent to your patio or 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
The mobility of containers allows you to move your trees whenever you choose -- 
perhaps for a special occasion, or to move the tree to center stage when it is 
loaded with colorful fruit or fragrant flowers. Choose a container slightly 
larger than the container the tree was in when you bought it. 
</P>
<P>
Clay pots, wooden containers, even wine or whiskey barrels make good containers 
for citrus trees -- just make sure they have drainage holes in the bottom. For 
added color, plant cascading flowers at the base, such as ivy geraniums, 
petunias, pansies, lobelia or alyssum. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid the possibility of your citrus tree quickly outgrowing its container, 
choose a dwarf or semi-dwarf tree. These are citrus trees which have been grown 
onto under stocks (the bottom half) of natural genetic dwarf citrus trees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Variation in Cold Tolerance 
</P>
<P>
According to Don Durling of Durling Nursery in Fallbrook, an authority on the 
growing of top-quality container citrus, a true dwarf citrus tree grows up to 6 
to 8 feet, a 75% reduction from full-size citrus. A semi-dwarf citrus grows to 
a maximum of 9 to 14 feet, a reduction of about 50%. Semi-dwarfs are the most 
commonly found and are plenty dwarf enough for containers. 
</P>
<P>
When deciding what type of citrus to buy, keep in mind that although all citrus 
are susceptible to frost damage when temperatures fall much below freezing, 
there is significant variation in cold tolerance among different citrus 
varieties. While limes require an almost frost-less climate, the kumquat has 
been known to tolerate temperatures as low as 15 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to individual cold hardiness, another consideration when selecting 
a citrus variety is the fact that a certain amount of heat is required to ripen 
citrus fruit. Some varieties need more heat than others to ripen and become 
sweet. 
</P>
<P>
If you live in a cool coastal area it will take much longer for your citrus to 
ripen than if you live in a hot inland area, and the fruit may not be as sweet. 
Valencia oranges need less heat to ripen than do navel oranges. Grapefruit has 
a high heat requirement and is best grown in the low desert or hot inland 
areas. It is sometimes tricky to tell when citrus fruit is ripe. Fruit color is 
often not an adequate indicator of ripeness -- the only sure way to determine 
ripeness is to taste the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Low Heat Requirements 
</P>
<P>
Lemons and limes are acid fruits with low heat requirements (they don't need to 
sweeten up), and are ideal for coastal areas. The Meyer lemon is a wonderful 
variety, as hardy as an orange, with large, ever-bearing fruit. It is a natural 
genetic dwarf, as is the kumquat, and naturally remains small. The Mexican 
lime, your standard bartender's lime, is your best choice if you live near the 
coast. Another exceptional lime is Bearss Seedless, which is light-yellow when 
ripe and almost as large as a lemon. 
</P>
<P>
Whether in a container or in the ground, citrus trees need little pruning -- 
prune only to shape or to reduce the height slightly. Dead branches and suckers 
arising from below the graft line should be removed. If you are pruning to 
remove shoots or branches damaged by frost, wait until new growth clearly 
defines the damaged areas. 
</P>
<P>
Citrus trees in containers need to be watered more frequently than those in the 
ground. When you do water, make sure you water thoroughly, until water runs out 
the bottom of the container. Depending on the weather, you will probably need 
to water your tree once or twice a week. If it is very hot or windy you may 
need to water more often. 
</P>
<P>
Container-grown citrus should be fertilized regularly with a complete 
fertilizer made especially for citrus. Follow label recommendations regarding 
container citrus. If chlorosis (yellowing) is not corrected by the usual 
applications of nitrogen fertilizer, suspect a micronutrient deficiency. To 
correct, apply a fertilizer containing chelated forms of iron, zinc and 
manganese. 
</P>
<P>
Citrus can usually be grown successfully by the home gardener without a regular 
pest control program. You really don't need to spray unless the infestation is 
severe or the fruit is being affected. 
</P>
<P>
Many pests are controlled naturally by beneficial insects that feed on the 
damaging ones. Aphids, mealybug and scale can be controlled with insecticidal 
soap or Malathion. An occasional shower with the hose helps to control mites -- 
or spray with Volck oil or a miticide.

INTERIORS: FAUX PANELS CAN BRIGHTEN A HUMDRUM WALL; 
</P>
<P>
THEY ADD A BIG SPLASH OF COLOR, DRAMA TO A ROOM FOR RELATIVELY LITTLE WORK.

<P>
Is a long, blank wall staring you in the face? One that doesn't seem to lend 
itself to pictures or shelves? 
</P>
<P>
One design solution is faux panels. These seldom-used, somewhat formal, 
decorative notes are actually not so complicated that they can't be done by 
amateurs, with some help from do-it-yourself manuals. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who can measure and miter-cut wood molding and put up quickie wallpaper 
or wall fabrics can transform dull-looking stretches of conventional flat 
paneling, dry wall or plaster. You sacrifice little or no space. 
</P>
<P>
And the technique can become "new wave" or "minimal" for modernist interiors 
with the use of metal or Art Deco moldings or mirrored paneling. 
</P>
<P>
"They add interest," says Baltimore designer Paulette Pierlot. She recently 
added moldings around traditional paintings in wall designs for a French 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
In another design, what she calls "an ugly expanse" of wall-to-wall sliding 
doors and windows 27 feet wide in a condo was attractively tamed and unified by 
framing the tops and sides in a latticework of conventional wood molding. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore muralist and designer Thomas Van Damme, who is also known for his 
elaborate illusionist wall treatments, says this about interior faux panels: 
</P>
<P>
"You can use them to create an illusion that a wall is something else that it 
isn't. Panels are useful in orchestrating space with elements that really 
aren't there physically. They are also useful in improving the proportions of a 
space." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Creating Interest 
</P>
<P>
Interest can be created on problem walls by making use of the virtually 
limitless moldings and custom papers and fabrics available today. Dining rooms, 
long hallways, libraries, dens and living rooms with high ceilings are some of 
the areas particularly suitable for faux-paneling techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Van Damme says any decorative wall treatment has to start with the assumption 
that "no walls or floors are absolutely level or equal in all dimensions . . . 
even in new housing." You get around the hurdle of the unevenness by careful 
use of a carpenter's level. 
</P>
<P>
He outlines the following step-by-step procedure: 
</P>
<P>
You have to decide in advance on the number of panels you are going to do and 
their proportions. Try not to repeat the same size panels monotonously. It's 
better to vary things. A scheme with "a large panel in the center flanked by 
two smaller ones will help the total architecture of the room," Van Damme says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Draw a Level Line 
</P>
<P>
Establish the distance you want your panel from the nearest window, door or 
corner. Place a pencil-point mark at the middle of the outside edge of the 
closest piece of molding. Using the level, draw a vertical line through the 
pencil point as long as the piece of molding. Then measure the bottom, top and 
other side of the panel, drawing them on the wall in pencil, and checking the 
bubble to see that each line is level. 
</P>
<P>
The pencil frame gives the outside dimension of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
Continue along the wall, drawing each panel according to your pre-established 
pattern, measuring not from the floor or ceiling or shoe molding, but from the 
level rectangle already drawn on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Once the pattern is in place, prepare the molding. It is helpful to have an 
experienced handyman or carpenter make sure the corners are mitered exactly. 
The pieces can be cut without delay from prefinished wooden or plastic 
moldings, but if you use unpainted wooden moldings, you should finish them 
before cutting or installation. 
</P>
<P>
The horizontal and vertical panels can now be placed on the wall. Run standard 
construction adhesive along the back of the moldings with a caulking gun and 
apply them to the wall. Small nails will hold the strips in place while they 
harden. 
</P>
<P>
If your panel is to frame wallpaper or fabric, rather than paint, cut the panel 
inserts a little larger than the measurements of the interior of each panel. 
Then use a razor blade or a matte knife to trim off the excess. If you are 
handling a large panel that will take more than one width of wallpaper or 
fabric, install the central strip first and work outward from there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prepare a Plan 
</P>
<P>
"Wallpaper and paint stores usually have brochures to help you out with the 
fine points of cementing with wall adhesives," Van Damme says. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some additional hints: 
</P>
<P>
It helps to lay out your panel scheme in advance on graph paper, using a scale 
of 1 inch to 1 foot. 
</P>
<P>
The most pleasing proportions for wall panels are said to be in ratios of 1 to 
2 or 3 to 5 along the sides, though rectangular panels in confined spaces, such 
as over windows or doors in high-ceiling settings, can violate this rule. Oval 
or half-round shapes, usually small, are also traditional in formal rooms. 
</P>
<P>
A crown molding that runs around the ceiling at the top of the wall is 
sometimes necessary as a finishing touch to balance a room redone with fabric 
or paper panels. Usually it is somewhat heavier and wider than the molding of 
the panel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chair Rail Accents Room 
</P>
<P>
A chair rail around a room gives another architectural accent to an interior. 
If you are installing one with paneling above, keep the rail 29 to 32 inches 
above the floor for rooms 8 feet to 11 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
If your planned panels have large enough interior spaces, they can be further 
glamorized by hanging framed pictures, medallions, small clocks and other 
decorative elements inside the molding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Technique 
</P>
<P>
There is a special technique for tacking up paneling strips without the risk of 
splitting them. If hardwood is involved, you should drill a hole in the wood 
before tacking it into the wall. Use a nail with its head snipped off as a 
drill bit to prepare the hole. For soft woods you need only tap the nail on its 
point. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing wrong with picking routine moldings from your favorite home 
supply store. Chain hardware-lumber outlet stores are good places to look. 
Molding strips 8 feet long and up to an inch or so in width and are likely to 
cost from 50 cents to about $2 a foot.

Remodeling the entrance of the Keyohara residence in Del Mar involved softening 
a harsh, unappealing entry in a few simple and inexpensive steps that did not 
alter the structure. 
</P>
<P>
Before the face lift, at right, the home suffered from a dated and 
uninteresting shoe-box look. Below, 1-by-8-inch "shiplap" cedar siding laps 
beyond the entry to help tie the existing stucco walls into the entry. The 
result is an updated and appealing entry. 
</P>
<P>
Step 1 -- Lap natural-color cedar siding in and around the entry to soften it 
and add visual detail. Miter all the corners. 
</P>
<P>
Step 2 -- Add low stucco walls and posts.

The number of Americans puttering around in their gardens has stayed about the 
same over the past two years, but they spent a little less money on their hobby 
in that time, a national survey shows. 
</P>
<P>
An annual survey conducted by the Gallup Poll for the National Gardening Assn. 
showed about 69 million American households participated on one or more types 
of indoor or outdoor gardening activities in 1988, compared to 70 million 
households in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the survey were based on findings of 2,500 at-home personal 
interviews conducted last October and November. The survey had a margin of 
error of plus or minus three percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
Lawn and garden retail sales in 1988 were an estimated $15.5 billion, compared 
to $17.5 billion in 1987. Americans spent an average $227 on their lawns and 
gardens in 1988 and $251 the year before, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
The widespread drought of 1988 -- the fourth worst on record -- and extreme 
temperatures in many parts of the country over the summer contributed to a 
decline in sales for 1988, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smaller Gardens Gain 
</P>
<P>
Aside from weather problems, other factors may have affected lawn and garden 
retail sales for 1988, said Bruce Butterfield, research director for the 
National Gardening Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller gardens are becoming more popular, he said, and lawn and garden 
activities compete with other leisure activities in terms of time and 
discretionary spending. 
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the biggest decreases in spending occurred among the 
same groups of people who spent the most in 1987, said Butterfield. It is 
possible that many consumers purchased lawn and garden products and equipment 
in 1987 that they did not need to replace last year. 
</P>
<P>
Through a demographic breakdown, survey results indicated the Midwest and West 
showed above-average participation in gardening activities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Poll Highlights 
</P>
<P>
America's gardeners run the gamut in terms of education, occupation and age, 
the survey said, with 79% age 30 or over, 94% having completed high school or 
college and 19% employed in a professional capacity. About 43% of the nation's 
gardeners earn $30,000 or more a year. 
</P>
<P>
Other highlights of the survey showed: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lawn care was the undisputed champion of outdoor activity: 53 million 
households reportedly spent time caring for their lawns. They spent $5.3 
billion on products and equipment, compared to $5.4 billion in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An estimated 38 million households had flower gardens in 1988, down from 39 
million reported in 1987. Retail sales for flower gardening declined 6% last 
year, to $1.68 billion, from $1.77 billion spent in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Vegetable gardening increased in 1988, with 31 million households growing 
vegetables compared to 29 million in 1987. However, the typical home vegetable 
garden was 200 square feet in 1988, compared to 300 square feet in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Herb gardening sales increased from $46 million in 1987 to $50 million in 
1988, but the number of herb gardeners decreased from 6 million to 5 million in 
the same time period.

SIERRA GATEWAY CENTER RIDES PALMDALE BOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The massive residential development boom that has made the Antelope Valley one 
of the fastest growing areas of the Southland is having its commercial 
counterpart in the Sierra Gateway Center. 
</P>
<P>
The $350-million, 150-acre master-planned development will occupy a mile of 
frontage along the west side of Sierra Highway between Avenue P and Avenue O in 
Palmdale, opposite U.S. Air Force Plant 42 operated by the Lockheed Corp. at 
the Palmdale Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Developed by Torrance-based LAMCO, Sierra Gateway Center will eventually make 
up more than 3.5 million square feet and more than 100 residential units, LAMCO 
President John Long said. The multifamily element of Sierra Gateway Center will 
be on 7 to 10 acres on the north side of the project, near Avenue O, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale is the fastest growing of the state's 444 incorporated cities, growing 
from about 23,000 residents in 1986 to more than 56,000 today, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Construction is under way on the two-building first phase, with each building 
totaling 55,000 square feet, but designed to be readily expanded to 85,000 
square feet, Long said. Occupancy of the concrete tilt-up structures, designed 
by the Nadel Partnership of West Los Angeles, is scheduled for the end of the 
year, he said. He added that the landscaped, park-like setting of the project 
is of a "higher quality . . . than those presently existing in Palmdale."

SANTA MONICA BUSINESS PARK NOW 95% LEASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recent lease transactions for 12,000 square feet of space -- including a law 
firm, computer company, medical equipment firm and an advertising agency -- 
have brought occupancy of the $65-million, 48-acre Santa Monica Business Park 
to 95%. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-building complex at 3250 Ocean Park Blvd., Santa Monica, has 1.9 million 
square feet, according to Tony Morales, marketing director of Transpacific 
Development Co., the developer. The recent leases for the 12,000 square feet 
are valued at more than $2 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Leasing activity at this park represents a trend among companies relocating 
from highly congested business corridors on the Westside to self-contained 
environments offering the same kind of amenities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The law offices of Citron &amp; Peters leased 5,200 square feet for 10 years, 
with Westmac Commercial Brokerage representing the law firm. QMS Inc., a 
manufacturer and distributor of computer laser printing systems, leased more 
than 3,000 square feet. Medirac, a medical supply firm, leased 2,050 square 
feet and Newmark &amp; Associates, an advertising firm, leased 1,800 square 
feet for its headquarters, Morales said.

<P>
Construction Launched 
</P>
<P>
Construction has started on the $15-million, 64,000-square-foot Century Medical 
Center at 116th Street and Hawthorne Boulevard in Hawthorne. Completion is 
expected next year, according to a spokeswoman for the developer, Century 
Freeway Medical Associates Inc., an affiliate of Tandam Builders Inc., Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Widom Wein Cohen, Santa Monica, is the architect of the six-story building, 
which will serve Centinela Hospital, Robert F. Kennedy Hospital and Daniel 
Freeman Hospital. Tandam Builders Inc. is the Construction Co.'s Sabre Springs 
Business Park, San Diego, for $2,587,000. Coldwell Banker represented the 
seller, and Cushman &amp; Wakefield represented the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
The buyer plans to build a $10-million, 108,000-square-foot manufacturing 
facility on the site.

SAN DIEGO FACTORY OUTLET CENTER GETS NEW OWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Factory Outlet Center, the first of its kind in the Southland, has 
been purchased by Wohl Investment Co., Irvine, from Plaza Mayor Investment, San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
American Senior Inns and Urban Group represented both parties in the 
transaction. The four-building, $14-million center opened last November just 
west of Interstate 5 on Camino de la Plaza in San Ysidro, the last exit before 
the U.S.-Mexico border. 
</P>
<P>
A second phase, valued at $1.2 million, is expected to be in construction this 
summer. The additional 20,000 square feet to the 125,000-square-foot project 
will bring the total number of tenants to 28. 
</P>
<P>
The converted shopping center is 80% leased with tenants such as Revlon, Izod, 
Corning, Bass, Black &amp; Decker, Nike, Mikasa, Van Heusen, Gitano, Aileen and 
Leatherloft. The retailing concept originated on the East Coast in such cities 
as Reading, Pa., Freeport, Me., and North Conway, N.H., where manufacturers 
lease space and sell direct to the public.

THE MAGIC OF MENTORING; 
</P>
<P>
UNIQUE PROGRAM MATCHES STUDENTS AT SANTA MONICA COLLEGE FOR ONE-ON-ONE 
COUNSELING WITH PROFESSIONALS IN THE ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE WHEELOCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although he taught high school math and science for 25 years, Joseph Hudock, 
75, always yearned to be an artist. After he retired from teaching, he finally 
fulfilled his dream and took up oil painting, drawing and lithography -- just 
for starters. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Bruce Crozat, 38, who has held a variety of jobs, never 
thought about being a professional photographer until he received a camera as a 
gift five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Today both men, along with 25 other Santa Monica College students, are involved 
in the SMC Arts Mentor Program, and both are busily preparing for upcoming 
exhibits of their works this summer. The present show at the college Art 
Gallery -- sculptures, drawings and paintings by Janet Kessler and an 
installation by James Linza featuring three-dimensional objects, paintings, 
music and smell -- runs through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
According to Randal Lawson, dean of arts, the program is unique within the 
California community college system. It matches top students from nine 
categories -- art, architecture, photography, interior design, fashion design, 
graphic design, music, theater and dance -- with instructors or professionals 
in those fields for one-on-one counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Crozat works closely with SMC photography instructor Larry Jones, who provides 
him with advice during weekly meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"Bruce is one of our better success stories," Jones said. "I've watched him go 
through a series of changes over the years and now he's a slick product 
photographer. 
</P>
<P>
"With this program and his exhibit, he has a chance to put his name out there. 
Unless you're a fine art-oriented photographer, galleries won't show your work, 
so this is a way to showcase our top photography students." 
</P>
<P>
Said Crozat: "I've made a lot of progress in my mentor year in terms of 
refinement of work. I've expanded artistically. I've gone from doing mostly 
commercial product shots to doing art, design and still-life shots, too. This 
program prepares you for a professional career because everything has to be 
perfect. You know you're having a show so you put forth your best effort." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hudock: "I'm always experimenting with art and I've expanded even more 
since I've been in the program. My mentor, Dan Freeman, has a way of knowing if 
I'm progressing or not, and he gives me literature about the newest ideas in 
art. The program is doing a lot for all the students. You can tell by their 
shows. The expression in the art is different from what you'd get in an 
ordinary classroom situation." 
</P>
<P>
The mentor program was created by members of the SMC Professional Arts 
Committee in 1986 to provide individual instruction each semester for 25 to 30 
students "who are beyond the level of classes we offer in different 
disciplines," Lawson said. "Other community colleges offer private instruction, 
but I think we're the only one that requires an audition or portfolio review 
for entry and covers so many arts areas. 
</P>
<P>
"Each department has set up its own selection criteria and review process, 
under an umbrella of certain college-wide qualifications. In some cases, there 
are certain courses students need to have taken prior to being admitted. It 
wasn't at all difficult to set up this program, and there's been a lot of 
interest in it from all over the country." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson noted that while many mentor teachers are SMC faculty members, sometimes 
experts from the outside arts community are paired with students, which leads 
to expanded involvement for the mentors. 
</P>
<P>
"Professionals who have joined our program become a part of the department," he 
said. "They come to student juries, and many of them have recitals, 
performances or shows of their work on campus." (Past mentors have included 
members of the L.A. Philharmonic and the Sequoia String Quartet.) 
</P>
<P>
Sixty-five students have been through the program since its inception, which 
allows them one to four semesters of involvement, with evaluation of their work 
required at the end of each semester. As for results, Lawson said: "As far as I 
know, all the students who have completed the program have gone on to do what 
they expected to do -- transfer to a four-year school, institute of arts or 
music conservatory or just to begin working in the profession." 
</P>
<P>
Glass blower Jeremy Cline, 24, has his goals planned. "This program has helped 
me get serious about art and prepare for the real world," he said. "In the fall 
I'm transferring to the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland and I 
may get" a master's degree in fine arts "so I can teach. Eventually I want to 
have my own studio and do fine art. 
</P>
<P>
"I work well with my mentor, Don Hartman, and I've learned how to stick with a 
problem and go all the way through the process," Cline said. "Often when you're 
doing art, you're too close to it to see it clearly. It's good to have someone 
else look at a project and open your eyes about it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hartman: "I try to let his ideas be his ideas and not change them. It's 
been stimulating for me to watch his work improve. It's an exciting program for 
a school like this, where most of the faculty are too busy to work individually 
with gifted students." 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Tina Blokh, 28, has literally traveled a long road to pursue her dream 
of becoming a concert performer and teacher. In an ironic twist of 
happenstance, she was matched with a mentor, USC instructor Konstantin 
Sirounian, who is from her home town, Tbilisi, in the Soviet state of Georgia 
-- a man unknown to her until she began the mentor program. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a professor from Moscow University and a wonderful teacher," she said. "I 
work with him at USC and I plan to get my master's degree there." 
</P>
<P>
Dance student Penny King, 40, has also traveled a long road from her childhood 
experience with Pacific Theater Ballet in Santa Monica to years of professional 
dance in Oregon, back to Santa Monica to study choreography with Linda Gold, 
coordinator of the SMC dance program. 
</P>
<P>
"I've found just what I needed here, and I'm blown away by my mentor," she 
said. "I thought this would be a nice little class on 'how to structure a 
dance,' but I didn't expect to have the opportunity to create in such a 
supportive atmosphere. Linda helps me clarify and whittle away excess movement, 
and I'm making a lot of progress with her." 
</P>
<P>
Gold is enthusiastic about the program. "It's an effective, self-directed 
teaching approach and with the extra time and attention given, the amount of 
progress that can happen is remarkable. The students become more independent 
artists. You can go to a different level with them, and that kind of evolving 
sophistication has been exciting to see. The students gain and so does the 
community because these are the artists who are serious, who want a chance and 
are willing to work for it." 
</P>
<P>
Lawson believes that the mentor program benefits more than SMC students. "It's 
brought new life to school departments and programs," he said. "And we've had a 
number of special art showings, concerts and performances that have resulted 
from it. Now we're working to better organize presentations and let the public 
know about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming shows include the work of Bruce Crozat (Friday to July 28), Santa 
Monica College Photography Gallery (Library Foyer), 1900 Pico Blvd., and Jeremy 
Cline and Joseph Hudock (July 7 to 21), Art Gallery, 1900 Pico Blvd.

RESTAURANT REVIEW: A DELI FOR ALL REASONS -- AND SOME OF THEM ARE BETTER THAN 
OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Look at this mustard. It's practically white. What's going on? 
</P>
<P>
I'm in Westwood Village, that village of mighty office buildings, first-run 
movie theaters and a major university, at a place called the Village Deli. 
There's a yearning about the place. It wants to be something: perhaps a deli 
for all these villagers, perhaps the ultimate California deli, perhaps even the 
Deli of the Future. 
</P>
<P>
The results seem odd. For instance, the Village Deli likes to think of itself 
as having classic New York-style decor, though there are big California picture 
windows, not to mention the potted plants, particularly in the second-story 
outdoor dining patio. This is also a deli that features a happy hour and total 
sports coverage and feels destined to become "the hottest place in town for 
upscale young singles and couples." 
</P>
<P>
A deli as the hottest place in town? It could happen. The demographics of 
Westwood seem stacked against it, though. At lunchtime, it does get 
power-dressers from the nearby office buildings, and even seems reasonably 
deli-like in some ways. At least some of the lunchtime waitresses know enough 
about deli tradition to address everyone as "sweetheart." 
</P>
<P>
However, from what I've been able to see, dinner time is when the upscale young 
singles and couples are not coming. It's when the UCLA students are coming, and 
the people who've come into Westwood to catch the movies, for instance at the 
major theater right across the street. This impression might be based on 
coincidence, or if it's the case, it might change. However, even the waitresses 
seem younger and more collegiate at night, and I've seen the large and 
well-stocked bar stand empty for hours on a Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Back to that pale mustard. I guess what happens is that under Westwood's 
cheerful skies, the sunlight just bleaches the color out because when you stick 
in a spoon and stir it around -- hold on, this isn't deli mustard. It's 
ordinary American hot dog mustard. And come to think of it, the horseradish 
sauce is delicious, but by some miracle, it's not the slightest bit hot. 
</P>
<P>
Let's have another look at that menu. There are overstuffed deli sandwiches, 
and at dinner, there are deli-type entrees such as stuffed cabbage. But there 
are also bacon and Cheddar potato skins, and quiche, and tostadas. Meanwhile, 
of all things, there are no Dr. Brown's sodas, not even a New York Seltzer. The 
mind reels. 
</P>
<P>
At least the sandwiches are good ones, overstuffed and not excessively humped 
up in the middle to make them look bigger than they are. The corned beef is 
perhaps a little better than the pastrami, and the brisket is not terribly 
lean, which is as it should be. I don't care what anybody says: Brisket is the 
part of the cow that would be bacon if it were in a pig; lean brisket is not 
brisket. 
</P>
<P>
The deli-type dinners that you can only order in the evening are plain and 
hearty home-style dishes, but the kishka was a puzzle to the UCLA students I 
took. In effect, it's a sausage with a stuffing so heavily breaded that there 
isn't any meat at all, served with a little bowl of very thick chicken gravy. 
Trying it may have added to their sophistication, but sophistication might not 
even be enough for somebody to appreciate kishka; it may be one of those dishes 
you have to have grown up on to go for at all. 
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian goulash is a beef 
</P>
<P>
stew with lots of onions and red cabbage in it, I suspect, which is why it's a 
bit sweet; very nice too. The old-fashioned beef stew is, I'm glad to say, not 
so old-fashioned as to have overdone vegetables, but there is a curious 
starchiness about it. The pot roast with potato pancakes (not the most 
character-filled potato pancakes I've ever had; the words "Aunt Jemima" 
actually crossed my mind) comes with what tastes a lot like chicken gravy. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the best of the dinners is the chicken with barbecue sauce. It's not a 
barbecued chicken, mind you; it seems to be boiled (which means it's not dried 
out, of course), and it has a pretty interesting barbecue sauce, rather like an 
Oriental sweet and sour sauce, and very good. 
</P>
<P>
Another good thing is cold beet borscht, which is always available no matter 
what the soup of the day is. Of course, so is the "famous gumbo," better 
described as a thick chicken-vegetable soup. 
</P>
<P>
I'm down to dessert now: pretty good mocha cake and a strawberry shortcake made 
with thick slices of yellow cake, pretty ordinary ice cream. Is this it? Is 
this the Deli of the Future? The thought is wearying. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested: borscht, $1.95; chicken dinner, $11.75; Hungarian goulash, $12.25; 
mocha cake, $2.25. 
</P>
<P>
 The Village Deli Restaurant and Bar, 10936 Lindbrook Drive, Westwood. (213) 
208- 3772. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner daily. Full bar. Street 
parking. American Express and MasterCard accepted. Dinner for two, food only, 
$15 to $46.

TWO-TIER ECONOMY FEARED AS DEAD END FOR UNSKILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL STEWART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Top economists, reacting to a study out of UCLA that described a startling gap 
between the rich and poor in Los Angeles, say that the disparity points to a 
looming mismatch between the region's new white-collar jobs and undereducated 
workers, a phenomenon that they warn could lead the city to economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The dilemma is a result of Southern California's extreme duality: a city that 
is at once a booming manufacturing and financial center thirsty for qualified 
workers, and a magnet for immigrants and urban poor who are educated only for 
blue-collar and unskilled jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Unless dramatic changes are made in the way the minority and 
immigrant-dominated student population is educated, economists and educational 
researchers predicted, Los Angeles will be flooded with underachievers who 
cannot supply the job boom, and the area could face a generation of economic 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
According to Stephen Levy, director and senior economist of the Palo Alto-based 
Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy, the region's students 
must be trained "not for the sake of altruism, but frankly to make the economy 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that the dental hygienist, computer repair person, physical 
therapist and secretarial jobs are growing -- jobs in an office setting that 
require good English, meeting the public and interpersonal skills," Levy said. 
"We have to move the institutions to train young people for this new type of 
middle-class job, because if we fail that, we will move toward the bipolar 
society. And this is not an issue we can be divisive about." 
</P>
<P>
The comments of Levy and others followed release of a UCLA study last week. In 
a nine-month study sponsored by the Graduate School of Architecture and Urban 
Planning, Professor Paul Ong and nine graduate students analyzed various 
federal economic, housing and demographic surveys. 
</P>
<P>
They found that, despite an ongoing economic boom, the gap between mostly Anglo 
"haves" and minority "have nots" is worsening in Los Angeles, driven in part by 
a surge in low-paying jobs that mire full-time workers in poverty, and by 
inferior urban schooling that prevents the young from moving up the economic 
ladder. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Levy, a noted economist, (no relation to Stephen Levy), professor of 
public affairs at the University of Maryland, and consultant to the Urban 
Institute, said the UCLA study appears to mirror a national trend in which 
American families have been trapped at or below the same standard of living for 
the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time since World War II, a robust economy and rising employment 
levels are failing to lift the poor out of poverty or to boost the middle 
class, Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
"If this had been 20 years ago, when average incomes were rising throughout the 
economy, you could have had growing disparity, but still everyone would have 
been getting better off," Levy said. "The rich would be getting richer faster, 
but at least the poor would be getting richer, too." 
</P>
<P>
While most economists are reserving judgment on just how wide the gap has 
become between rich and poor, with many waiting until the 1990 U.S. Census 
figures are available, Levy said there has been "some decline for those who 
have low earnings, and some explosion in earnings at the top." 
</P>
<P>
"Your gut sense is that while that explosion may not be very big in term of 
national numbers, it is concentrated in coastal cities like Los Angeles, New 
York and San Francisco," he said. "You wouldn't see the same kind of disparity 
in Kansas City." 
</P>
<P>
Because incomes are flat or declining for all but those at the top, the 
potential for a growing division between the classes, with fewer workers left 
to supply the boom in white collar and technical mid-level jobs, has the 
experts concerned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Forming Into Two Tiers 
</P>
<P>
Allen Scott, a UCLA professor of economics and urban geography, and author of 
"Metropolis," a book on the Southern California economy, said the labor force 
here "is clearly bifurcating into two tiers. We are increasingly competing with 
the Third World, so a Third World economy and Third World conditions are being 
created here, and that is a policy disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Goetz Wolff, chief economic analyst for the Los Angeles Economic Roundtable, 
warned that if the region attempts to compete against low-wage workers 
worldwide, "we will lose that battle, because they will always be able to pay 
less elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
While such complex issues may portend deep troubles for the region's economic 
well-being, city, state and federal policy makers are only now beginning to 
become aware of such possibilities, several economists and educational 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly the educational community is aware and the business community is 
very vocal about the need for educated students, but we are just at the stage 
of recognizing the problems and seeking solutions," said Gordon Palmer, 
principal economist for the Southern California Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer said Southern California's labor force will soon be minority-driven, 
"and these people are going to have to be assimilated for business to survive. 
Business has no choice but to have a greater integration of minorities into all 
job types and all wage levels." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of Jobs Seen 
</P>
<P>
And if the Los Angeles region does not begin producing these better-educated 
workers, he said, "the fact is the jobs will go somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Despite these red flags, few changes are afoot in schools in the Los Angeles 
region, educational experts said. They said undereducated minority and poor 
students are moving from school into the same cycle of poverty as their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
"How ironic it is, that just when our economy is producing a surplus of jobs 
that would pay people enough money to lift them out of poverty, the school 
system is not producing students who can handle those jobs," said Kati Haycock, 
director of the Achievement Council, a private group that trains California 
schools to raise achievement levels among minority and poor children. 
</P>
<P>
Especially alarming to such experts are the vast numbers of immigrant children 
entering the labor force -- a group that, in the America of past decades, 
received an education markedly superior to that of their parents, landed better 
jobs than their parents, and moved into the stable middle class. 
</P>
<P>
The Achievement Council, which has studied the causes of low learning and poor 
grades among minority and poor children, lays much of the blame upon outdated 
and uninspired inner-city teaching practices, the watered-down curriculum 
foisted upon such children and the assigning of inexperienced teachers to 
troubled urban schools. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chronic Underteaching 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles' minority-dominated schools, Haycock said, most teachers 
chronically underteach math, science, literature, history, reading and writing, 
and rely upon "boring rote training" long-ago dispensed with at high-achieving 
suburban schools. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, compared to nearby suburban schools, urban Los Angeles schools have a 
sharply disproportionate share of inexperienced teachers who cannot cope with 
the inner-city environment, plus a disproportionate share of very old teachers 
who do not keep up with teaching techniques or modern curricula, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Orfield, professor of political science at the University of Chicago who 
has studied Los Angeles schools, said: "I don't think people in this country 
ever voted to take away the opportunities of poor people, but that is what has 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
Orfield said deepening racial isolation in neighborhoods and schools, decreases 
in college financial aid, cuts in minority recruitment efforts and the 
funneling of minorities into "dead-end community colleges" have combined to 
"assure that only a handful of Los Angeles' minority high school kids will ever 
graduate from college." 
</P>
<P>
The Achievement Council's Haycock said that pressure is being applied, both on 
state officials and the private sector, to infuse large amounts of money into 
education. While the arguments for tackling inferior urban education in the 
1960s and 1970s were "essentially moral ones," Haycock and others said, the 
arguments now are economic. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody in suburbia who thinks their own kids are doing fine better realize 
that 20 years from now their kids' lives will be very much intertwined with 
these (minority and poor) kids," Haycock said. "If the minority and poor kids 
are allowed to fail, this is not going to be a nice place to live."

MACARTHUR PARK;

<P>
POLICE TRY TO RETAKE IT FROM DRUG DEALERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
On a bright, hot afternoon last week, shirtless young men brazenly peddled bags 
of marijuana on a grassy knoll in MacArthur Park just west of downtown Los 
Angeles, hurrying toward buyers as they emerged from a tunnel walkway under 
Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
A short distance away, at a park entrance just off 7th and Alvarado streets, 
scores of men and women milled about crowded park benches, opening their hands 
quickly so passers-by could see glass vials of what looked like tiny gray 
pebbles. 
</P>
<P>
"How much you want, baby?" rasped a heavily made-up, very pregnant woman, whose 
belly jutted out oddly from a rail-thin body. 
</P>
<P>
"Roca roca. Roca roca," a man standing nearby said repeatedly. 'Roca' is a 
Spanish term for "rock," or crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
This scene unfolded in the sixth week of a massive police crackdown on drug 
dealing in the park, a square, 32-acre expanse that is the centerpiece of Los 
Angeles' Westlake District and what may be the most popular open-air drug 
market in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Since April, police and nearby residents have been trying to take MacArthur 
Park back from scores of drug addicts and drug sellers who all but overrun 
whole sections of the park almost everyday. 
</P>
<P>
During the last four weeks alone, police have conducted almost daily sweeps and 
have reported making 750 arrests in the park or on its periphery, most of them 
involving narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
Agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have seized the automobiles 
of suspected drug buyers while officers armed with binoculars have spied on 
drug sales from top floors of structures overlooking the park. 
</P>
<P>
The drug activity has been stemmed somewhat. Still, last Tuesday, a typical 
weekday at the park, the scene on its southern, lake side was so frenzied, 
chaotic and intimidating that most legitimate park-goers steered clear of it. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the problem were scores of homeless people, runaways and other 
street people who are themselves either drug addicts or merely destitute. 
Because of the intense use of the park, litter is a constant problem. The 
stench of urine is overpowering in some places. 
</P>
<P>
To stroll around the park's lake is to wade through a sea of misery and vice. 
</P>
<P>
"MacArthur Park for years has been known as a place where you could buy drugs, 
but it's never been this bad," said a uniformed police officer who is assigned 
to park patrol. 
</P>
<P>
His sentiment was echoed by a worker at a food concession who said drug dealers 
in the past "at least tried to hide what they were doing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Crack Cocaine 
</P>
<P>
Many agree that a major difference today is the nature of crack cocaine, a 
highly addictive, cheap form of the drug that often causes addicts to lose 
interest in all else. By far, said police, crack is the drug most easily 
available in the park. 
</P>
<P>
"You can be standing there making an arrest and they'll walk up to someone a 
hundred feet away and try to make a (crack) buy," said Police Sgt. Mike Pattee. 
"It's either they're very stupid or they're so strung out they don't care." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors said the sellers also exhibit bizarre behavior. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had them dive on my windshield when I've been driving past trying to show 
me their vials of crack," said Adolfo V. Nodal, a city cultural affairs officer 
who lives near the park's western border. In 1983, while he was director of 
exhibits at Otis Art Institute of Parsons School of Design, which also borders 
the park, Nodal established what is now an internationally known public arts 
project in MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
Although he remains one of the park's most vocal supporters, he no longer 
"hangs out" there, he said, because "its too scary." 
</P>
<P>
"It's really weird that we worked so hard to get visitors from all (over the) 
world to come visit the art work," he said. "Now if they do, they'll probably 
get mugged." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Earlier Drug Problem 
</P>
<P>
Nodal said when he arrived at the institute in 1983, the park had a similar 
drug problem, but the situation had improved dramatically with establishment of 
the arts program and his concurrent founding of the MacArthur Park Community 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
The council is a voluntary group of area residents and business people who 
organized a neighborhood watch program, conduct cleanup campaigns and lobby for 
improved services from city agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, art students working with Nodal installed or painted 11 sculptures 
and murals in the park. During that period, said Nodal, the park consistently 
improved. In 1986, the park underwent a $400,000 face-lift that included badly 
needed lighting. 
</P>
<P>
Nodal said he realized the park had deteriorated badly after he returned in 
November as general manager of the city's Cultural Affairs Department after a 
yearlong stay outside California. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his alarm, however, Nodal was optimistic that the situation will be 
brought under control by the police and by a renewed activism of the residents. 
He said that the northern section of the park remains mostly free of drug 
dealing. Thousands of people still go there for legitimate reasons, he said, 
"overwhelming the criminals" on some days. 
</P>
<P>
"On a personal level, I'm appalled at what is happening," he said. 
"Philosophically, I know a park is just like anything else, it ebbs and flows 
and changes and has its ups and downs." 
</P>
<P>
That ebb and flow as the history of MacArthur Park is recounted in "The Arts 
Made a Difference," a book by Nodal about the MacArthur Park Public Art Program 
that was published this year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Swamp in 1885 
</P>
<P>
According to that account, the site that eventually became the park was a swamp 
and neighborhood dump in 1885 when it was bought by then-Mayor Henry Workman 
with $500 in donations and $500 from the city treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Topsoil was imported to the area, Nodal wrote, which was then "lushly" planted 
in a "natural and rustic" style by a "leading Victorian gardener." Known then 
as Westlake Park, the site soon became a major attraction for tourists and 
Angelenos who were especially drawn to its large, natural lake. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1920s, some of the city's finest and best-known hotels began to spring 
up around the park, giving the area the genteel character that it would 
maintain for the next two decades. 
</P>
<P>
"Neon signs, believed to be the first in the United States, proliferated on the 
rooftops surrounding the park" at that time, wrote Nodal. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilshire Boulevard viaduct, which bisects the park diagonally -- connecting 
the halves with two tunnels -- was built in 1935. Seven years later, Mayor 
Fletcher Bowron, with the aid of newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst, 
renamed the park for Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who was Hearst's choice for a 
presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
MacArthur himself showed up at the park for a belated renaming ceremony in 
1954. 
</P>
<P>
The park began its first major slide toward deterioration after World War II, 
Nodal said in an interview, when the area's demographics changed dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
As the white middle-class departed downtown for the suburbs, he said, they were 
replaced mainly by retirees on fixed incomes, about 5,000 of whom still live in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the neighborhood around the park, the most densely populated in the 
city, has become "the entry point" for poor immigrants from Central America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Immigrants Recruited 
</P>
<P>
Some narcotics officers believe that established drug traffickers recruit from 
this group to sell drugs in the park. To those unable to work legally, the 
offer might be attractive. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Robert W. Riley, commanding officer of the Rampart Division, which 
includes the park, said that 60% of the drug arrests at or around the park are 
of Central Americans. Of those, he said, 80% are undocumented aliens, chiefly 
Salvadorans and Nicaraguans. 
</P>
<P>
The drug buyers, on the other hand, come from all over the city, he said, "from 
60 miles in all directions, from Orange County, Beverly Hills, Pasadena, 
wherever you can think of," a patrol officer said. 
</P>
<P>
The current crackdown began shortly after Riley took over the Rampart Division 
two months ago and after Police Chief Daryl F. Gates toured the park. 
</P>
<P>
Even before that, however, action had been taken by the community council and 
the MacArthur Park Foundation, a nonprofit arts promotion organization Nodal 
also helped organize before he left Otis/Parsons. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the groups began pressing for the demolition of five structures 
inside the park near Park View Avenue and 7th Street that had once housed 
lavatories, shuffleboard courts, a snack bar and a shed for card playing, but 
had literally been taken over by addicts. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, said neighborhood residents, as many as 50 games of pinochle, 
bridge and chess would be going on in the shed, a favorite hangout of retirees. 
</P>
<P>
The games ended there last year when the drug activity in the bathrooms and the 
nearby grounds drove the players to outdoor tables closer to Wilshire 
Boulevard. Since then, they have had to move twice. They now play exclusively 
in the northern section of the park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Out in the Open 
</P>
<P>
The demolition of the shed and lavatories earlier this year probably did more 
to push the worst of the drug-related activities out into the open air, 
everyone agrees. Even so, they say, the action was for the best. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, you had 80 or 90 addicts out there in the open," said one 
resident. "But at least now you can see what they are doing." 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the next step in the process is to replant the area of razed 
structures with grass and low-growing greenery that won't screen drug activity. 
</P>
<P>
Next summer, the southern section of the park will be closed and the lake 
drained for construction of a Metro Rail turnaround station underneath, a 
project expected to take up to three years. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, officials hope, the drug activity will have been long gone.

EL SEGUNDO LOOKS AT NEW TAX TO SOLVE BUDGET WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a move that has prompted the city's largest employer to cry foul, El Segundo 
council members are proposing that a payroll tax be imposed on business to bail 
the city out of its fiscal woes. 
</P>
<P>
The council has scheduled a special meeting Tuesday to try to reach agreement 
on just how high the new tax should be. The tax would replace at least one tax 
now levied on business. 
</P>
<P>
"We want a tax that not only allows us to balance the budget immediately, but 
also will allow us to avoid having to come back to the table again in the 
future and say we need other taxes," Councilman Jim Clutter said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of Hughes Aircraft Co., the city's biggest firm with about 27,000 
workers, said that a payroll tax, which is levied as a percentage of the money 
a company spends on wages and salaries, will not provide the city with a stable 
solution for its financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
The company argues that a number of other El Segundo employers do a great deal 
of defense work, which results in the number of workers on their payrolls 
fluctuating tremendously. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes also contends that a payroll tax discriminates against corporations that 
employ a large number of well-paid professionals, which it does. 
</P>
<P>
"We are dead set against a payroll tax," said Jim Hurt, the company's director 
of public affairs. "It'll hit a company like Hughes disproportionately harder 
than it will others." 
</P>
<P>
The council's decision to adopt a payroll tax comes after months of debate over 
how the city should go about raising new monies. Besides Hughes officials, an 
official at Rockwell International also questioned whether the adoption of a 
payroll tax is wise. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Saunders, president of the 500-member El Segundo Chamber of Commerce, 
said the organization had taken no position on the payroll tax until it is 
determined how much it would be and what existing taxes would be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Although once flush with money, the city has been forced to search for new 
sources of revenue since 1982, when the local Chevron USA refinery lost a major 
contract for the sale of fuel oil and the city's sales tax revenues plummeted 
by millions of dollars annually. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, city officials in the past two years have been forced to delay 
millions of dollars of capital improvement projects, and this coming fiscal 
year, the city faces a budget deficit of $1.6 million. Without a new source of 
revenue, cutbacks in all the city's major departments, including fire and 
police services, could result, said interim City Manager Frank Meehan. The 
city's annual operating budget is about $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
As now planned, the payroll tax would supplant a $60-per-employee tax that 
council members adopted in 1986. The council has complained that the tax is 
hard to administer because the methods for computing the number of employees 
vary. For instance, many larger companies hire temporary, or contract, workers 
and do not count them as part of their own work force, the council has said. 
This is particularly true of aerospace companies. 
</P>
<P>
Council members also said they might abolish another tax, which charges a 
business a nickel for each square foot of space it occupies over 5,000 feet. 
The city collected just under $5 million last fiscal year from both the 
employee and square footage taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Just how much more money a payroll tax would generate is uncertain because 
council members have yet to decide just how high it should be. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' Rate 
</P>
<P>
However, if the council decides to charge the same payroll tax as the city of 
Los Angeles -- 0.75% -- it could raise more than $14 million annually, 
according to El Segundo officials. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Alan West said that he favors a payroll tax of 0.25%. 
</P>
<P>
Clutter, however, has said he wants to charge the same percentage as Los 
Angeles. "I see no reason why El Segundo should take a lesser tax than Los 
Angeles," Clutter said. 
</P>
<P>
Hurt said that he did not know how much Hughes could wind up paying under the 
payroll tax. The company paid $2.1 million this fiscal year in employee and 
square footage taxes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hurt argued that a payroll tax makes little sense at a time when the company's 
local work force has dwindled in response to expected federal defense spending 
cutbacks. During the past several years, Hughes' El Segundo work force has 
decreased by about 3,000 workers, and further reductions are planned in coming 
months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Good' 
</P>
<P>
"For the city to hang its hat on a payroll tax in this kind of climate is not 
good for the city and certainly not good for us," Hurt said. 
</P>
<P>
That same view was expressed by Rockwell International, which has about 4,200 
employees in El Segundo. At the peak of the company's B-1 bomber program in 
1985, it employed 8,400 workers locally. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seems to me that a payroll tax in this area, which is heavy with 
defense work, would be counter" to providing a stable source of revenue, said 
George Wiley, the company's director of human resources. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman West countered that a payroll tax makes sense because, as the work 
forces at companies such as Hughes and Rockwell decrease, so does the cost of 
providing city services for them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TAXING BUSINESS IN EL SEGUNDO 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo is considering levying a payroll tax to help it make up a projected 
1989-90 deficit of $1.6 million in a $20 million operating budget. Here are 
1988-89 revenues from the city's current $60-per-employee tax and 5-cent 
square-footage tax compared with projected revenues from a payroll tax. 
</P>
<P>
CURRENT TAXES 
</P>
<P>
Employee tax: $3.9 million 
</P>
<P>
Square footage tax: $960,000 
</P>
<P>

IMPACT REPORT CLEARS HERMOSA OIL DRILLING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hermosa Beach's long-delayed effort to get its share of the South Bay's 
petroleum reserves has moved a step forward with the completion of an 
environmental impact report. But the project faces more hurdles, and drilling 
is unlikely to begin for another six months to a year. 
</P>
<P>
The consultant's report, prepared by Irvine-based Ultrasystems Inc. for the 
city, generally concludes that an "urbanized" oil recovery effort, which 
utilizes various mitigation measures, will have little effect on the 
surrounding environment. 
</P>
<P>
A public hearing on the report will be held by the Planning Commission, 
probably late next month, when another obstacle may surface. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drilling Approved 
</P>
<P>
Two 1984 initiatives approved drilling at the city's maintenance yard at 6th 
Street and Valley Avenue and at the closed South School site, a block away on 
Valley. But two other initiatives that passed by substantially larger margins 
in 1984 and 1986 mandate preserving the school land as open space. Normally, in 
cases of conflicting initiatives, the one with the most votes prevails. 
</P>
<P>
The city plan is to confine the drilling to the city yard and use a portion of 
the school property for storage and processing tanks. But if the open-space 
mandate of the initiatives stands, the city does not have sufficient room at 
the maintenance yard to carry out the plan evaluated in the environmental 
impact report. 
</P>
<P>
After about two years of paper work and wrangles with the State Lands 
Commission, which must ultimately approve oil drilling in the tidelands, the 
city contracted in 1986 with Marina del Rey-based Macpherson Oil Co. to carry 
out the current drilling plan. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Macpherson Sr., a 30-year veteran of oil-recovery operations in 
California and Texas, said last week that he hopes to begin work at the Hermosa 
Beach yard in six months to a year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a long haul getting to this point," he said. "But we're confident 
that the oil is down there and we're committed to do everything we're asked to 
do to fit our operation into the environment down there." 
</P>
<P>
Tidelands extend three miles out to sea from the onshore tide level. Land-based 
operations reach any oil under the ocean floor by drilling down and then 
slanting the bores at angles up to 90 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Cities like Hermosa Beach hold the offshore mineral rights in trust, but 
generally the state gets a cut of any revenues generated from oil and gas 
operations, and a city's share is often restricted to public improvements in 
the tidelands. 
</P>
<P>
According to the consultant's report, Macpherson will start with three 
exploratory wells at the city yard, using temporary production facilities at 
that site. If tests prove promising, up to another 27 wells will be drilled at 
the yard and permanent production facilities will be built on the nearby school 
property. 
</P>
<P>
To make room for the drilling operation, the city's maintenance yard will be 
moved to the school site. Trucks will haul the oil and waste products until 
production exceeds 800 barrels a day, when oil and gas pipelines will be laid 
along Valley Drive and up Herondo Street to connect with an existing Chevron 
pipe at Prospect Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The environmental report reviews about 20 factors, ranging from noise and air 
quality to visual aesthetics and issues of public policy. The 175-page 
document, plus appendixes, outlines elaborate measures to minimize potential 
problems and make the operation blend into the surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unavoidable Impacts 
</P>
<P>
It estimates that the exploratory and drilling phase will take up to three 
years and acknowledges some "unavoidable adverse impacts" during that period, 
such as an increase in noise levels, emissions from trucks and construction 
equipment, and a 135-foot derrick visible throughout the neighborhood. It will 
be sound-dampened and camouflaged with neutral coloring. 
</P>
<P>
Over the long term, the report says, "some hydrocarbon odor may be detected 
periodically" and the upper portions of camouflaged, 16-foot storage tanks on 
the school property will be visible from some locations. 
</P>
<P>
The report may be viewed by the public at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
A primary motivation for the Hermosa Beach project originally was a perception 
that Redondo Beach has been sucking up all the oil from the northern edge of 
the Wilmington-Torrance field that extends under the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
Sheila Schoettger, Redondo Beach's harbor director, said her city may have 
drained a bit of the reserves under Hermosa Beach in its early oil-recovery 
efforts, which began in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints Are Rare 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not like pulling a cork out of a bottle and everything runs out," she 
said. "We believe that any drainage there may have been stopped long ago." 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Beach experience offers some encouragement on the environmental 
front to its neighboring city. Schoettger said the city rarely receives any 
complaints about noise and odors near the well site at Harbor Drive and Beryl 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people who visit the harbor area or live there don't even know that 
we have oil wells," she said. 
</P>
<P>
However, if the output from those wells is any indication, Hermosa Beach may 
not find much black gold. Schoetter said Redondo Beach, which started with 58 
wells, now has only 15 or 20 "in some sort of active state. It's not going 
well. We're definitely on the downside." 
</P>
<P>
She said production has dropped to about 45,000 barrels a year, down from a 
peak of 705,000 in 1958. Total revenue over that span came to $14 million, she 
said, with the city collecting only about $175,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely not getting high-grade oil, so the payoff is low for that 
reason, also," she said. "About 98% of what comes up is water." 
</P>
<P>
Early estimates of the hoped-for bonanza in Hermosa Beach ran as high as $25 
million over the 35-year life of the proposed project. City Manager Kevin 
Northcraft, a relative newcomer who missed the early years of the project, was 
reluctant to offer a current estimate. But he said the oil revenue could be 
substantial.

TEACHERS WHO BLAME REFINERY FOR SICKENING INCIDENT ORGANIZE A PRESSURE GROUP

<P>
Gertrude Delaney has not been in class for two months. 
</P>
<P>
Her daily routine as a special education teacher helping students to overcome 
learning disabilities has been replaced by a more painful and personal 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Now, instead of seeing students, she sees doctors. 
</P>
<P>
Delaney, her teaching assistant, and eight students at Magruder Middle School 
in Torrance were hospitalized March 8 after being felled by fumes believed to 
have come from the nearby Mobil Oil refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Although the precise source of the fumes has never been identified, the 
experience of teachers and students at Magruder has focused attention on the 
potential health effects of exposure to toxic chemicals from the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rotten-Egg Odor 
</P>
<P>
Teachers at Magruder have organized a group to press for the elimination of 
toxics and to demand that Mobil provide information about the health effects of 
exposure to what is widely believed to have been hydrogen sulfide. The chemical 
forms a toxic gas that has a characteristic rotten-egg odor. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil has not accepted responsibility for the fumes but has paid the medical 
bills of those injured. 
</P>
<P>
In case of another episode, teachers have asked to have oxygen on hand at the 
school on 185th Street, a quarter of a mile northwest of the sprawling 
refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Children playing outside Magruder's buff-colored buildings were the first to 
complain on that March morning. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shooting Pains 
</P>
<P>
"I heard children say: 'What's that smell? What's that smell?' " Delaney 
recalled last week. "I was so used to having odors from that refinery . . . 
that I just ignored it." 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, Delaney said she noticed an acid-like smell. "I started having 
pain in my throat. As it got worse, it went straight through my body, up my jaw 
and down my arms," she said. "I was getting more and more panicky. I couldn't 
breathe, the pain was so severe." 
</P>
<P>
Her teaching assistant, Lorie Ustick, also began having difficulty breathing. 
</P>
<P>
Ustick said she too smelled an acidic odor. Tears started running down her 
face. She felt as if her sinuses were on fire, that there was fire down her 
throat and burning in her chest. 
</P>
<P>
Special education teacher Kathryn Brooks, whose classroom next door to 
Delaney's also faces south toward the refinery, described the odor as a very 
strong rotten-egg smell. 
</P>
<P>
"The doors and windows were open. It just blew right in," Brooks said. "It 
continued to get worse and worse until you could not draw a breath. It felt 
like you were suffocating." 
</P>
<P>
Principal Sidney Morrison said the odor was so powerful that he doubled over as 
soon as he opened his office door. "It was almost burning in its intensity. It 
was the worst kind of rotten egg (smell) you can imagine." 
</P>
<P>
Delaney, 54, of Torrance developed a case of what her doctors called chemical 
bronchitis. 
</P>
<P>
She went back to school March 28. But on April 12, Delaney said she smelled the 
"very same smell that I smelled the first time." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District said the agency 
received three complaints of a bad smell on that day. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Delaney said, she suffered chest pains, hoarseness and a second case of 
chemical bronchitis. 
</P>
<P>
"The second exposure was extremely traumatic to me. I could not stay at school 
any longer. I cannot go back to that school," Delaney said. "I cannot go 
through that again. I could be dead." 
</P>
<P>
Delaney has not taught at Magruder since then. She filed a worker's 
compensation claim with the school district and, after 12 years at Magruder, is 
being transferred to another school farther from the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
She and Ustick are considering a lawsuit against Mobil alleging that they 
suffered long-term health damage. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview in their attorney's Manhattan Beach office, Delaney said 
she is "not feeling very well emotionally or physically." 
</P>
<P>
And Ustick, 35, of Redondo Beach broke down in tears while recalling the 
incident. Both women said they have suffered memory loss and disorientation. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks said she also suffered from chemical bronchitis that her doctor has told 
her was caused by overexposure to hydrogen sulfide. The 40-year-old teacher 
consulted an industrial toxicologist who said her lungs could remain inflamed 
for up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
The fumes they inhaled have heightened concern among faculty members at the 
school, which ironically bears the name of Philip Magruder, a former Mobil 
official. 
</P>
<P>
"There are teachers who have been here for many years that have grave concerns 
about the safety of themselves and the students," Morrison said. "The incident 
itself has reminded people of a clear and present danger. . . . When you see 
kids getting carried away, you know there is a danger over there." 
</P>
<P>
The incident was the second involving Mobil and Magruder in four months. 
</P>
<P>
In December, thousands of pieces of fiberglass insulation blew off a storage 
tank at the refinery and across the schoolyard. Students were kept inside while 
the material was cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
After the March incident, teachers organized a group -- Faculty United at 
Magruder for the Elimination of toxic Substances -- nicknamed FUMES. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Mobil Oil Refinery in Torrance is responsible," the teachers 
wrote in a petition to the Torrance Teachers Assn. and to the school board. 
"Although Mobil has not admitted responsibility, they are 'footing' the bill 
for medical treatment." 
</P>
<P>
The organization is supporting the city of Torrance's lawsuit seeking to have 
the refinery declared a public nuisance. The teachers also urged the Torrance 
Unified School District board to go on record in favor of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
The teachers said they are "deeply concerned about our health and safety not 
just for the present, but for the future as well." 
</P>
<P>
The city's lawsuit alleges that teachers and students at Magruder suffered 
headaches, nausea and chest pains as a result of a noxious odor and fumes from 
the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Odds 'Good' It Was Mobil 
</P>
<P>
Torrance Fire Chief Scott Adams said Mobil was the likely source of the 
problem. "The odds are good that it was Mobil and the odds are also good that 
it was hydrogen sulfide," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While paramedics worked on the injured students and teachers, an inspector from 
the South Coast Air Quality Management District tried unsuccessfully to locate 
the source of the odor. 
</P>
<P>
After inspecting the refinery during four days after the incident, AQMD 
officials cited Mobil for three violations of air quality laws. The violations 
were for two separate releases of excessive smoke from flares that burn off gas 
and for not having a gas flow monitor in operation on a flare. 
</P>
<P>
AQMD spokesman Bill Kelly said the flares could have emitted hydrogen sulfide. 
Mobil is contesting those citations. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil did agree last month to pay a $5,000 fine for another violation involving 
failure to have properly certified pollution monitoring equipment in operation 
on a new sulfur plant at the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil's environmental manager, Greg Munakata, said the refinery agreed to pay 
the fine to the AQMD although Mobil had asked for an extension of time from the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to meet the monitoring requirement. 
</P>
<P>
In its lawsuit, Torrance contends that individuals living and working near the 
refinery are suffering short- and long-term health problems, including 
respiratory disease, heart disease, cancer and genetic damage because of toxic 
air pollution from the refinery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Allegations 
</P>
<P>
The city alleges that short-term exposure to hydrogen sulfide may be lethal and 
poses an immediate danger to health, causing severe eye and respiratory tract 
irritation and a loss of one's sense of smell. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil denies Torrance's allegations and has begun preparing its legal defenses. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Carbonetti, spokesman for Mobil, said refinery personnel have never been 
able to determine the source of the odor at Magruder, although they believe 
that it was hydrogen sulfide. "We couldn't find any evidence of a leak," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked why Mobil assumed responsibility for the medical bills of teachers and 
students, Carbonetti replied: "The wind was blowing from the direction of the 
refinery. The odor was a hydrogen sulfide odor. . . . The circumstances just 
dictated that we assume the responsibility for taking care of the people who 
were involved." 
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that "we haven't been able to pinpoint it to an exact cause." 
</P>
<P>
Morrison said Magruder's faculty is not satisfied with Mobil's inability to 
explain what happened that morning. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still in the dark. No one knows why it happened, but it did happen and 
there were consequences," he said. "If you don't know why it happened, then it 
could happen again at any time." 
</P>
<P>
Morrison said teachers are concerned about lingering health effects from 
exposure to hydrogen sulfide. They asked Mobil to pay for independent medical 
tests to assure that there was no long-term damage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assurances Asked 
</P>
<P>
After the Magruder incident, PTAs at that school and others in north Torrance 
wrote Mobil to express concern and ask for specific assurances about the safety 
of teachers and students. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil has invited Morrison and members of the Torrance Council of PTAs to 
attend a question-and-answer session and tour of the refinery this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The dialogue between Mobil and Magruder comes too late for Delaney. 
</P>
<P>
Morrison said Delaney's departure from the Magruder family is a real loss. 
</P>
<P>
"For her to have to leave here has been a devastating experience for her. She 
feels a real sense of loss leaving Magruder," he said. "I feel a real sense of 
loss too. It should not have had to happen this way."

HARBOR DEPT. OPPOSES PLAN TO TURN CANNERY INTO A SHOPPING COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A proposal to renovate a Wilmington pet food cannery into a restaurant and 
shopping complex has run into opposition because the Los Angeles Harbor 
Department wants to demolish it to make way for expansion of its maintenance 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
The plan to remodel the Heinz Petfood Co. cannery, which is scheduled to close 
Sept. 1, is backed by Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores and a 
citizens advisory committee that is planning a waterfront development on port 
property in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory committee, which was appointed by the Los Angeles Harbor 
Commission, has recommended that its study area be expanded to include the 
cannery, which is on Fries Avenue, not far from the foot of Avalon Boulevard, 
the focal point of the committee's review. 
</P>
<P>
"We need an anchor, we need something that is going to give this place an 
identity, something that would be unique, that would give us a drawing card 
that nobody else in the south coast area has to offer," said committee Chairman 
George De La Torre, who first proposed the cannery conversion and then 
persuaded Flores to back him after taking her to see a similar project in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Department officials, however, say they have reviewed the proposal and 
concluded that they can't give up the land, which they plan to use as a storage 
area for heavy machinery. However, their decision could be overturned by the 
harbor commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan to redo the yard depends on the cannery property," said Nelson 
Hernandez, the port official who acts as liaison to the committee. "Without it, 
we really can't provide the type of services that we need for our tenants right 
now and in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Top aides to Flores said Friday that the councilwoman will press for 
commissioners, along with other port officials and community leaders, to take a 
walking tour of the area to see its potential. 
</P>
<P>
Flores' chief deputy, Bernie Evans, said: "The councilwoman wants everybody to 
go down there, the citizens advisory people, the commissioners, some key staff. 
. . . Let's walk down to the cannery site and let us visualize it before we set 
everything in concrete." 
</P>
<P>
"We're still going to pursue it," added Ann D'Amato, Flores' harbor area 
deputy. "We're not just going to give up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Committee 'Shook Up' 
</P>
<P>
The department's decision sparked the ire of members of the advisory committee, 
which learned of it last week from Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was shook up," said committee member Gertrude Schwab, adding that 
relations with Hernandez have been "pretty cool" ever since. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the decision, De La Torre said the committee has asked to meet 
directly with harbor commissioners. "It just seems that Wilmington has never 
really been in a position to enjoy the fruits of the harbor. . . . " he 
complained. "You look at San Pedro, you look at all the recreational 
facilities, tourist facilities. And what have they done for Wilmington?"

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: CIVIL AIR PATROL CADETS LAND A NEW HOME AT TORRANCE 
AIRPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It looks like the Civil Air Patrol's Cadet Squadron No. 107 in Torrance will be 
getting a home to roost in after having been forced from its aerie at the 
Torrance Airport in March. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and the cadet squadron have signed a lease that will give the 
squadron a 2 1/2-acre parcel of airport land for the princely sum of $1 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the 20-year lease, the volunteer-run organization has 2 1/2 
years to build two new aircraft hangars, plus classroom and meeting facilities, 
at the site on the airport's eastern end, said Roger Griffin, an 18-year member 
and former squadron commander. 
</P>
<P>
The squadron hopes to pay for the facilities, totaling about 6,000 square feet 
and costing an estimated $100,000, through fund-raising drives and donations, 
Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
The organization had its headquarters in buildings and a hangar at the Torrance 
airport since 1979. But the squadron was forced to leave its 7,000-square-foot 
facilities when city officials decided to tear down the buildings on the site, 
which faces Crenshaw Boulevard, and replace them with a commercial development, 
Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the cadet squadron has been sharing a 200-square-foot space with 
Senior Squadron No. 129, in a building near the Torrance Airport tower, Griffin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough trying to hold a meeting with 60 people in a 200-square-foot 
space," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Civil Air Patrol is a volunteer organization and a civilian auxiliary of 
the Air Force, Griffin said. Members of the cadet squadron, most of them 12 to 
18 years old, learn emergency skills, leadership training and aerospace 
education from adult squadron leaders. Members of the senior squadron are 
adults who voluntarily assist aviation authorities in search-and-rescue 
missions. 
</P>
<P>
Flying lessons are available to participants, most of whom are interested in 
aviation, said Griffin, who is a flight instructor. The emphasis on aviation is 
what makes the Torrance Airport location attractive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We like it because we are aviation-oriented," Griffin said. "Flying is part of 
our program and the proximity to the airport is important to us." 
</P>
<P>
While money is being raised and plans drawn up for the new structures, the 
cadet squadron will continue sharing space with the senior squadron, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, since turnabout is fair play, the senior squadron has proposed 
consolidating with the cadets and sharing the roomier new space. Adrianne 
Goodman

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South Bay is likely to have some of the cleanest garages in town today, 
thanks to the city of Los Angeles' Household Hazardous Waste Roundup on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the six-hour roundup in Harbor City, more than 1,000 residents 
had dropped off hundreds of containers of paint, used motor oil, insecticides 
and other hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
With state voter approval of Proposition 65 in 1986, it became illegal to 
dispose of hazardous materials in household trash, according to city spokesman 
Tony Harris. Toxic materials could contaminate landfills where trash is 
deposited and eventually seep into the public water supply, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The parking lot at Narbonne High School was transformed into a huge collection 
site on Saturday. About 100 workers, including city refuse crews, employees of 
the city's toxic-waste consulting firm and volunteers, were dressed in 
protective garb and glasses to collect the materials. Scores of bags of kitty 
litter were on hand to absorb spills. 
</P>
<P>
Among the participants was Lance Coffey of San Pedro, who dropped off a 
55-gallon container of used motor oil collected by his neighborhood. "I have a 
truck, so I got to make the delivery," he said cheerfully. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Bisbee of Harbor City got rid of a 10-year accumulation of paint, used 
motor oil and garden insecticides Saturday and said he was relieved to dispose 
of it in a safe and legal way. "I'm getting ready to move, so when I heard 
about this event I cleaned out everything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Harbor City roundup was the fifth of eight planned by the city this year. 
At the first four, more than 5,000 households disposed of 13,000 gallons of 
paint, 9,000 gallons of motor oil and 500 batteries, Harris said. Usable paint 
is recycled for graffiti removal programs, and motor oil and battery parts also 
can be recycled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Poisonous and other nonrecyclable materials are sent to licensed toxic-disposal 
sites in Santa Barbara and Kern counties, according to Jim Grant of Safety 
Specialists Inc., the firm the city hired to help conduct the roundups and 
dispose of toxic materials. 
</P>
<P>
Three more roundups will be held in other areas of Los Angeles. Then the Los 
Angeles City Council will decide whether to continue the pilot program or set 
up permanent sites, Harris said.

Two 4.1- magnitude earthquakes shook residents awake early Saturday, but no 
damage or injuries were reported, officials at the U.S. Geological Survey in 
Golden, Colo., said. The temblors struck five miles north of this community. It 
was not immediately known whether the second quake, occurring an hour later, 
was an aftershock of the first.

COMPLAINTS SHADOW GOOD-WILL TOUR OF SUNSHINE CANYON LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles city officials and leaders of half a dozen neighborhood groups 
toured the Sunshine Canyon Landfill in Sylmar on Saturday morning to discuss 
waste disposal problems with the operators of the dump, Browning-Ferris 
Industries. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Browning-Ferris has quarreled with residents over the dump, one of 
the largest in Los Angeles County. The idea Saturday was to bring together 
landfill operators, San Fernando Valley residents and Los Angeles city 
officials for a discussion of what both sides called the city's looming 
waste-disposal crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not here to talk about Sunshine Canyon," said attorney Richard H. Close, 
president of the Coalition of Valley Communities. "We've got a trash crisis 
here in the city. We need to talk about how the city is going to solve it." 
</P>
<P>
Four of the nine landfills in the county are scheduled to be closed in the next 
five years, prompting concern that there will be no place to put the about 
45,000 tons of garbage produced in the county each day. 
</P>
<P>
Four landfills rim the northern Valley, and many residents have charged that 
the dumps are mismanaged and allow toxic gases and materials to endanger 
surrounding residences. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a Los Angeles City Council committee upheld a decision by the 
city's Board of Zoning Appeals that will cut dumping at the Sunshine Canyon 
site by 90% after 1989. The decision, which Browning-Ferris intends to appeal 
to the entire council, came as the result of longstanding complaints by Granada 
Hills residents about the dump's odors, dust and litter. 
</P>
<P>
Browning-Ferris held the tour to improve its image and to push for plans to 
extend the dump over the city boundary into the county. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frequent Inspections 
</P>
<P>
"This site is inspected roughly 300 times a year by the state, the city, the 
county and the air quality district," Browning-Ferris Vice President Les 
Bittenson said as the bus lumbered to the top of the landfill, a 
1,700-foot-high mesa under which lies millions of tons of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
To the north of the landfill lies an untouched canyon on county land, where 
Browning-Ferris hopes to expand. At a distance, goats could be seen grazing at 
the foot of the canyon. "There's capacity for 13 million tons of garbage 
there," Bittenson said. 
</P>
<P>
Some activists seemed impressed, but not Granada Hills resident Frank McArthur, 
who called the proposed expansion "a bad idea." 
</P>
<P>
Milena Miller of the Reseda Community Assn. said the landfill was "a necessary 
evil," but added that it was important to eliminate garbage "at the source" 
with recycling programs. 
</P>
<P>
Several community activists attacked City Councilman Hal Bernson for his 
support for development projects that they said are contributing to the growth 
of the city's population and adding to the thousands of tons of garbage 
produced by the city each day. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'People Keep Coming' 
</P>
<P>
Bernson responded angrily: "The problem is that people are going to keep coming 
to Southern California for jobs, for homes. You're not going to be able to stop 
growth. That's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Miller appeared unconvinced. "I'm seething inside, Mr. Bernson. Don't tell me 
that growth is not an issue," she said. "I'm doing my part and you're telling 
me I have to accept this growth all around me." 
</P>
<P>
Bernson said part of the problem may be solved if a dump proposed for Elsmere 
Canyon in the Santa Clarita Valley is approved. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn Wessell, a spokesman for Browning-Ferris, said the solution was the 
proposed expansion of the Sunshine Canyon Landfill. "We're here operating 
safely; we just have to move over a little," he said. "We expect county 
approval. We've got community support."

REMELMEYER, CITIZEN OF YEAR, COMES HOME FROM HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BAIRD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Retired Torrance City Atty. Stanley E. Remelmeyer had two things to celebrate 
on Saturday: getting out of the hospital and winning the Torrance Area Chamber 
of Commerce's Distinguished Citizen of the Year Award. 
</P>
<P>
Remelmeyer, who had open heart surgery at Torrance Memorial Hospital Medical 
Center on May 26, said in a brief telephone interview Saturday that he felt 
unwell last week and re-entered the hospital Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He said doctors removed fluid from his chest cavity, and by Saturday he was 
feeling "much better" and expected to go home. Hospital officials said 
Remelmeyer was discharged Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The 71-year-old Remelmeyer just missed being able to accept the Chamber of 
Commerce award Friday evening. He said his wife, Becky, accepted it for him at 
a banquet at the Torrance Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
Known as the dean of South Bay city attorneys, Remelmeyer served as Torrance 
city attorney for 32 years. He is regarded as a major influence in Torrance's 
development from a small town into the fourth-largest city in the county. He 
continues to serve as a legal consultant to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Commerce chose to honor Remelmeyer because of his "significant 
achievements" on behalf of the community, including volunteer service for the 
American Red Cross, said Ida Aube, the chamber's economic and community 
development manager. 
</P>
<P>
Also honored by the chamber were Cherryl Liddle, who helped raise $2.9 million 
for United Way, and John Alter, who was honored for volunteer service to the 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Remelmeyer retired from the city of Torrance in November, and in May was 
appointed interim city attorney for Hermosa Beach. Just two weeks later, he 
suffered chest pains while attending a political fund-raiser in San Pedro and 
later underwent triple bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Remelmeyer said he was pleased to to win the chamber honor on 
Friday and "to go home today."

VOLUNTEERS TAKE BREAK FROM CLEANUP TO RESCUE CYCLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The volunteers of the Los Angeles Search and Rescue team had planned to take a 
break from their usual work routine. Instead of tracking down a lost hiker or 
camper, they had decided to spend Saturday morning cleaning up the fire roads 
and hiking trails in the Santa Monica Mountains north of Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
But just as the volunteers set out on the cleanup with shovels, rakes and 
plastic trash bags, a report came over their portable radios: A bicyclist had 
just fallen into a ditch from one of the trails that they were supposed to 
clean up and needed to be rescued. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone came for the cleanup," said volunteer rescuer Antonio Arizo. "It just 
happened that somebody fell off his bicycle." 
</P>
<P>
Once 28-year-old Bob Sack of Encino had been evacuated on a Fire Department 
helicopter -- he was listed in good condition with a broken leg at Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center -- the rescuers got back to the first business of the 
day, cleaning the mountain roads of old washing machines, parts of abandoned 
cars and other trash. 
</P>
<P>
About 30 people from Search and Rescue teams and a mountain bikers association 
volunteered for the cleanup, which was organized by the Police Department. 
Officer Craig Morgan said the usually deserted trails and roads, off the 
unpaved portion of Mulholland Drive above Encino Reservoir, have become popular 
dumping sites for contractors, gardeners and others who want to surreptitiously 
dispose of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
"People want to dump here rather than pay the fees at a dump site," Morgan 
said. "When we catch them, we arrest them or give them a citation." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, among the volunteers was Paul Roane, 24, who said he had been arrested 
Monday night while illegally dumping a truckload of gravel. Morton said Roane 
had been released on condition that he join in the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Enjoys Scenery 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Barbara Boswell of Woodland Hills had volunteered because 
she regularly uses the trails not to dump trash, but to enjoy the scenery from 
her bicycle as a member of the Concerned Off-Road Bicyclists Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Boswell used a rake to pick cigarette cartons, discarded cans and plastic cups 
from the brush on the steep slopes below the trails. But she confessed that she 
had no stomach to pick up all the trash she saw. 
</P>
<P>
"There was half a dozen pairs of women's underwear," she said. "I didn't want 
to touch that stuff."

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY WON'T SELL COAST LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though a number of South Bay individuals and organizations have plans for 53 
acres of undeveloped coast land owned by Los Angeles County along the Rancho 
Palos Verdes-San Pedro border, the county has shelved plans to dispose of the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
The county bought the land in the early 1970s for a park that was never 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
The flurry of interest by environmentalists in recent weeks came after the 
county Regional Planning Commission acted on a finding by the county Department 
of Parks and Recreation that the land is no longer needed. It said that sale of 
the land in Rancho Palos Verdes, on a bluff overlooking the ocean, would not 
conflict with the county general plan. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that the department began the process of declaring it 
surplus by asking for an appraisal, chief park planner Jim Park said last week 
that there has been no decision on what to do with the land. He called the 
commission action premature and said the county's options are to let the 
property remain open space, to develop a park or sell the land. 
</P>
<P>
The Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy, a nonprofit group wishing to 
acquire land for public use, said it wants to work with Rancho Palos Verdes to 
preserve the land as an undeveloped area. Rancho Palos Verdes resident Kay Bara 
has proposed that the four peninsula cities jointly buy the land. 
</P>
<P>
Park said that earlier, the Sierra Club advocated keeping the land as open 
space and that inquiries about buying it have come from San Pedro mobile home 
residents who want to develop their own mobile home park. Orange County 
developer Barry Hon also has expressed interest in buying it for homes, a hotel 
and golf course.

DEATH ROW: A PLACE FOR FEAR TO GROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN QUENTIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On occasion, when Luis Rodriguez walks past some of his neighbors' "houses," he 
imagines that skeletons are sitting inside, staring back at him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like you're dead. You just haven't realized it yet," said 
Rodriguez, a muscular man of 33, who for the last eight years has lived on 
California's Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of this state's 259 "condemned" live in East Block, California State 
Prison at San Quentin. It is a hangar-like structure, five tiers high, 60 cells 
to a tier, 70 years old. It is the nation's third-largest Death Row, behind 
Texas and Florida, and it is growing like a boom town. 
</P>
<P>
Everything about Death Row is unprecedented. The population has never been so 
large. Prisoners have never stayed so long. Half have been there five years or 
longer, 15 have been there since 1979. California has never gone so long, 22 
years, without an execution. 
</P>
<P>
It can be violent. More often it is tedious. It is also becoming more bleak for 
the inmates. The state Supreme Court led by conservative Chief Justice Malcolm 
M. Lucas regularly upholds death sentences. Concerned that the affirmances are 
making the condemned men more desperate, San Quentin officials are tightening 
security in the already maximum-security East Block. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't drop your vigilance on a group like that," said Daniel Vasquez, a 
tough, stocky 24-year veteran of the prison system who worked his way from a 
tier officer to become warden here in 1983. "Even though it (an execution) is 
still a faraway concept, the reality is that they are condemned to death." 
</P>
<P>
In conducting more than 30 interviews and examining dozens of Death Row court 
documents, another reality stood just as forcefully: Death Row is a place of 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Loss of Privileges Feared 
</P>
<P>
Wives of condemned men complained about strict visiting room rules and rude 
officers, but would not speak publicly for fear that their husbands would lose 
privileges. 
</P>
<P>
Few prisoners would consent to interviews. They fear that any article about 
life on the row would only inflame passions about capital punishment and hurt 
their chances of winning retrials on appeal. One prisoner who agreed to an 
interview told of fears that gnaw at him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even eat my food until my neighbors have started biting into theirs," 
said Robert Bloom, as concerned about what some of the officers might do to him 
as he is about his enemies among fellow inmates. " . . . Even then, I sit there 
and I smell it, and if anything smells wrong, I won't touch it." 
</P>
<P>
Officers, who wear green uniforms, call themselves the Greens. Prisoners, who 
must wear blue shirts and blue jeans, are called the Blues. Greens talk about 
sports or some other innocuous topic with the Blues. But they never reveal 
anything personal for fear that prisoners could somehow use it against them. 
One veteran officer said he does not so much as register to vote because he 
worries that prisoners will get his address from the public record. 
</P>
<P>
Inmates occasionally do attack officers, generally with prison-made blades, or 
by tossing hot water or whatever else is at hand. But for the most part, the 
Greens and Blues coexist. 
</P>
<P>
The men spend a minimum of 20 hours a day in what most call their houses, cells 
that are 10 1/2 feet long, 4 3/4 feet wide and have concrete walls 10 inches 
thick. To pass the time, they stare at television, comb law books, or run scams 
hoping to gain an edge and make their lives easier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 Suicides This Year 
</P>
<P>
Some develop powerful muscles by lifting weights during four hours a day on the 
exercise yard, or by doing endless push-ups in their cells. Prisoners with 
cells that front one of the long, narrow and unwashed windows can gaze upon San 
Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Three have killed themselves in the last year. Others go crazy waiting for a 
death by lethal gas that will come who knows when. One thing they have is time. 
A dozen years after California reinstated the death penalty, few if any of them 
are going anywhere any time soon. Many are convinced they will never leave 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't know where it's going to end, but they know they're never going to 
get out. You can see it in them," said Rodriguez, 33, who hopes one day to walk 
away free. A Superior Court judge has overturned his conviction for the murders 
of two California Highway Patrol officers in 1980, though he will remain on 
Death Row pending an appeal by the attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
The furor in California over the death penalty has abated 2 1/2 years after 
voters affirmed their strong support of capital punishment by ousting liberal 
Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and two other justices. The liberals' 
conservative replacements have upheld 53 death sentences since taking over. 
</P>
<P>
Prisoners, prosecutors and prison officials agree that executions are coming at 
some point. Some death penalty experts predict that executions will become 
routine in time. But with 1989 more than half over, chances are another year 
will pass without a state-sanctioned killing in California. 
</P>
<P>
Judges and juries, meanwhile, will sentence as many as 40 more people to death 
this year. Prison officials expect the condemned population to exceed 300 by 
next year. Whether or not an execution takes place, Death Row will consume an 
ever-increasing amount of Department of Corrections dollars, cell space and 
time. 
</P>
<P>
With the unanticipated growth in the condemned population, life on Death Row 
has clearly undergone noticeable changes. 
</P>
<P>
Prisoners, for example, no longer are allowed to mill about inside their 
cellblock as they did in the first years after California reinstated capital 
punishment. Their numbers would make supervision impossible. Officers say they 
often are kept running from the time their shift begins. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rules Govern Lives 
</P>
<P>
"There are days when I don't even have time to sit down," said one young 
officer, speaking on the condition that he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
From first morning light, both the jailers and the jailed are governed by 
rules. The condemned are segregated from the 2,800 other prisoners at San 
Quentin, so they eat in their Death Row cells. Food arrives on carts. Officers 
will not serve breakfast until prisoners turn on their lights. In turn, 
officers in charge of the carts have thermometers and must check to see that 
food arrives at acceptable temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Detailed records of food temperatures are kept and periodically presented to 
Robert Riggs, a lawyer appointed four years ago by a federal judge to oversee a 
1980 settlement of a suit over Death Row conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Those records show, for example, that fried eggs have gotten to the cells at an 
unacceptable 49 degrees. If the food arrives cold too often, lawyers for the 
prisoners can ask that Riggs hold the state in contempt of court. 
</P>
<P>
Preparation for exercise starts at 8:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, each prisoner strips. An officer stands outside the locked cell and 
directs him through a thorough search, body cavities included. The inmate 
extends his arms behind his back, allowing the officer to reach into the cell 
to apply handcuffs. A gunnery officer with a semiautomatic rifle watches from a 
catwalk set off from the cells. 
</P>
<P>
Once the double locks on the cell door are released, the prisoner, dressed in 
underpants, socks and shoes, is escorted by two officers to a holding cell. 
There, the clothes that he will wear to the exercise yard are searched. After a 
final check with a metal detector, the prisoner is let onto an exercise yard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life in the Yard 
</P>
<P>
On the yard, prisoners have weights, punching bags and basketballs. Some 
exercise in groups, or play dominoes, checkers, cards or chess. The prison 
tries to separate them from their enemies on six separate yards. But with 50 or 
more men on yards 32 feet by 42 feet, fights break out. Officers occasionally 
fire warning shots to break them up. If the fight doesn't stop, officers can 
shoot at the inmates. 
</P>
<P>
In prison, attacks can come for "nothing, for nothing at all," Rodriguez said. 
With muscles of a man who can bench-press 360 pounds and a good share of prison 
smarts, Rodriguez is not one to cower in the safety of his cell. But he also 
has scars on his back and shoulder from a stabbing in 1984. He also said he was 
wounded by fire from an officer's gun. 
</P>
<P>
Bloom, 25, is short, pale and looks anything but intimidating. Nonetheless, he 
talks toughly about how he fought back when he was jumped, stabbed with a blade 
and pummeled with an exercise weight in 1986. He blames the attack on "Nazi" 
officers who failed to protect him, and on inmates who harass him because he's 
Jewish -- "and proud of it." 
</P>
<P>
"They don't want me wearing my yarmulke in the yard," said Bloom, on the row 
for the 1982 murders of his father, stepmother and stepsister in their Sun 
Valley home. 
</P>
<P>
"They wasn't even man enough to come at me one on one," Bloom said of his 
attackers. "Two watching for the police, and then two of them had to jump on me 
at once. . . . The weights came crashing down on my head, and then a knife in 
the back, which is a typical Nazi move." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Another Search 
</P>
<P>
Officers say -- and Bloom's pallor confirms -- that these days he spends most 
of his time in his cell, rarely venturing to the exercise yard. 
</P>
<P>
The return trip from the exercise yard begins at 12:45 p.m. After a search, 
inmates, one at a time, are escorted back to their cells, where they remain 
until exercise time the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Some cells are squalid. One inmate stores bag lunches under his bed for weeks 
at a time. Officers can issue disciplinary citations to inmates for messy 
cells, but say they don't have time to fill out the paper work. Besides, most 
prisoners keep their "houses" tidy. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has got to be perfect. You can walk into their cells, and they come 
back from their shower and say, 'You were in here.' Even if you don't touch 
nothing, they know you were in there," said an East Block officer. 
</P>
<P>
Back when the population was in double digits, prisoners could spend their days 
roaming the tier of the original Death Row, the top floor of North Block, 
called North Segregation. But the old Death Row, intended for a maximum of 47 
inmates, long since has been outgrown. 
</P>
<P>
Prison officials say the design of East Block, with walkways 300 feet long and 
less than five feet wide, precludes out-of-cell time within the cellblock. The 
cost of rebuilding the aged structure to allow for more time out of cells could 
be $100 million, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Inmates Were Assaulted' 
</P>
<P>
Cost is one concern. Control is another. When prisoners could roam the floor of 
North Segregation, weaker ones "were subjected to homosexual acts," Lt. Melford 
Hamilton, a supervisor on the row, told Riggs earlier this year, justifying the 
prison's refusal to grant prisoners more time out of their cells. "Inmates were 
assaulted. And because of . . . the way the tier was designed, it was able to 
be covered up and staff would not discover it for weeks," Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
Though alone in their cells now, prisoners still manage to communicate, often 
by unreeling their "fish lines." Using bars of soap as a weight and torn bed 
sheets as a line, they are able to fling messages or items of value to the 
cells of their friends. 
</P>
<P>
"They got it so they can get something from (Tier) Five all the way down to 
One. They can get something from one end of the tier to the other one, through 
a gap (at the bottom of their cell door) that isn't any bigger than that," a 
veteran officer said, holding his hands inches apart. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, after the 49ers' victory in the last Super Bowl, for example, the 
morning shift arrives to find there was heavy drinking the night before. 
Although it is against the rules, prisoners make their own booze. One way is to 
pick the raisins out of a Danish and let them age a few days. 
</P>
<P>
To celebrate July 4, a well-placed stomp on a milk carton is an ideal 
substitute for a firecracker. The pop echoes like a gunshot. Such sounds make 
officers nervous. 
</P>
<P>
Inmates are allowed to store coffee, smoked oysters, chocolate chip cookies and 
other food in their cells. They may subscribe to almost any magazine, though 
the prison did censor a recent issue of Hustler with an article by a 
disgruntled ex-officer who derided San Quentin. 
</P>
<P>
Prisoners can buy color television sets with maximum 13-inch screens. The 
state, believing that television is an effective tool for control, provides 
black-and-white sets free, and free cable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Officer Shooting Cheered 
</P>
<P>
An officer recalled how the prisoners cheered at the scene in "Robocop" in 
which the cop was shot repeatedly. "It didn't seem appropriate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, East Block officers believe prisoners should have less than they 
get. Available to Death Row inmates, but not to mainline prisoners, are 
electric typewriters with memories, if they can afford them, and telephones 
wheeled to their cells, one officer noted bitterly. 
</P>
<P>
"They might have been a homeless tramp on the streets (who) murdered someone," 
the officer said. "Now he's living better than he ever was. He gets three meals 
a day, roof over his head, medical and dental care. His shirt gets ripped, you 
get him a new one. His shoes wear out, he gets a new pair." 
</P>
<P>
To pass the time in their cells, many prisoners take up painting or crafts. 
They may sell their work and keep the proceeds. Portraits of Magic Johnson, 
Michael Jackson and other famous entertainers painted by Kevin Cooper, 31, on 
the row since 1985 for the murders of four people in Chino, hang in a public 
gift shop just outside San Quentin's main gate. 
</P>
<P>
Another Death Row artist is Theodore Frank, 54, a child molester locked up 
since 1980 for the torture-murder of 2-year-old Amy Sue Sietz, whom he kidnaped 
in Camarillo. In one of the stranger aspects of life on the row, outsiders have 
sent pictures of their children to Frank. He paints portraits of them and sends 
them back. 
</P>
<P>
Frank, who once studied to become a Trappist monk, also is among the prisoners 
who has turned to God since arriving on the row. But "it's rather difficult" 
for inmates to practice religion, Harry Howard, a retired chaplain at San 
Quentin, testified at Frank's 1987 retrial, in which he was resentenced to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Religion for the 'Weak' 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the thing to do," Howard said. "Inmates and even staff tend to 
belittle that experience and often see it as an experience of the weak, the 
persons who can't hold their own." 
</P>
<P>
Condemned prisoners who have turned to God complain about being denied the 
privilege of worshiping in the prison chapel. Contending that a pastor might be 
taken hostage, San Quentin requires that chaplains be kept separate from 
condemned worshipers by bars. 
</P>
<P>
On the old Death Row, chaplains held services for groups of three or four men 
who were locked in a shower. Now, services are held on exercise yards, and 
pastors stand on the opposite side of the chain-link fence from the prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
Many other prisoners find solace in lawbooks, spending their days searching for 
cases to help in their appeals. When they're not researching criminal law, the 
jailhouse lawyers focus their attention on prison conditions. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most litigious is Rodney Alcala, 45, among the few condemned inmates 
who has a college education. Alcala, who has been on the row since June, 1980, 
for the murder of a 12-year-old girl in Huntington Beach, began a recent writ 
by declaring that condemned prisoners were suffering a "denial of same medical 
care available to general population." 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 21 immaculately typed pages replete with scholarly references to 
buttress his claim, Alcala asked a Marin County Superior Court judge to find 
that he had a constitutional right to dental floss. 
</P>
<P>
The judge turned him down. 
</P>
<P>
The prison had stopped giving floss to Death Row prisoners, contending that, 
together with toothpaste or some other abrasive, it could be used like a saw to 
cut the steel meshing and bars on the cells. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rules Defended 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Vernell Crittendon justified the denial of other items to some or all 
Death Row prisoners, testifying before Riggs that the cord on an electric razor 
and ground-up matches can be fashioned into a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
Fastened together, belts could be used to scale a wall, Crittendon said. 
Non-dairy creamer burns like napalm. One brand of disposable lighter has a part 
that is a Z-shaped piece of stainless steel. Members of the Aryan Brotherhood 
once started cutting cell bars with the small pieces of steel. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the Prison Law Office, which represents prisoners in litigation 
over conditions, argue that San Quentin has overstated security threats on the 
row. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers seek to force the prison to treat Death Row prisoners the same as 
it treats other inmates and are asking Riggs to recommend that San Quentin 
provide the men with such items as non-dairy creamer and dental floss. 
</P>
<P>
"The gas chamber is staring them in the face. It keeps them from misbehaving," 
Prison Law Office Director Donald Specter said. He maintained that the 
condemned cause fewer problems than other prisoners because their prison 
records could be used against them in any retrial. "The consequences of a 
misdeed are much greater." 
</P>
<P>
Condemned inmates who do create problems are placed on Grade B status. Grade B 
inmates get only 10 hours a week of exercise, rather than the 29 hours given to 
Grade A inmates, and are denied such items as razors, mirrors and telephones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hard-Core Convict' 
</P>
<P>
An almost perpetual Grade B prisoner is Billy Ray Hamilton, 39. He has been on 
the row since October, 1981, for a triple murder the year before to silence a 
witness who testified against a friend, Clarence R. Allen, 59, who also is on 
the row. The two have little contact, though Allen sometimes yells up to 
Hamilton's third-tier cell, asking if he needs anything, an officer said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wants to be Billy Ray's friend . . . maybe because he's so 
notorious," the officer said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a hard-core convict, doesn't ask for anything, doesn't expect anything," 
the officer said. "You tell him no, he accepts it. He doesn't whimper or cry. . 
. . He's not one to lay in bed and sleep. He's up and about the best he can in 
that little cell. He doesn't have his TV on. He doesn't want to vegetate. He'll 
exercise, run in place, do push-ups." 
</P>
<P>
Between the Grade A and B inmates are the "walk-alones." They are the serial 
killers, child murderers and informants who would be attacked if they mingled 
with other prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
"They're more or less the sissies of the group," an officer said. "They're the 
criers. If they don't get what they want, it's 602 time, you know, appeal 
time." 
</P>
<P>
At the far psychological fringe of Death Row are men who, if they weren't crazy 
when they arrived, have slipped since their arrival. Some are shut-ins and 
never venture out to the exercise yard. Others are screamers and chant long 
into the night. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Fuller, 35, was a particularly troubled inmate. On the row since 
February, 1983, for killing a cab driver in Culver City, Fuller stayed in his 
cell virtually all the time, becoming so pale that "you could see the blood 
coursing through his veins," an officer said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Authorities Warned 
</P>
<P>
Fuller's lawyer and his mother repeatedly warned prison authorities that he was 
suicidal. At least twice, when he fell deep into insanity, authorities moved 
him to the California Medical Facility at Vacaville for observation. 
</P>
<P>
Back at San Quentin and in an apparent flash of awareness in March, Fuller 
wrote a two-page letter to his mother. In it, he expressed sorrow for the pain 
he caused her, professed his love for her and told of his bleak existence. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since my difficulties began," he wrote, ". . . I have steadily declined. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
"My difficulties returning again and losing control (are) of great concern to 
me. . . . Most troublesome of all to me is that I face the rest of my life in 
prison." 
</P>
<P>
On March 24, Fuller tied a torn bedsheet to a cell bar and hanged himself. A 
month earlier, his lawyer, Robert Bryan, had won a court order for a hearing to 
test Fuller's competency, and was preparing for it when Fuller killed himself. 
Fuller was the seventh Death Row inmate to commit suicide, the third in the 
last 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
"These men get very depressed. They feel very little self-worth," said Dan 
Smith, a minister, who with his wife, Josie, periodically drives three hours 
from his home in Fresno to visit 16 condemned men at San Quentin, out of a 
Christian belief that they all "are God's creatures." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prison Marriages 
</P>
<P>
For most of them, the Smiths are their only visitors. 
</P>
<P>
Although few friends or relatives visit men on the row, some have married since 
arriving. Prisoners' advocacy groups provided the names to female volunteers, 
who started corresponding, then visiting. The relationships may be unusual, but 
two of the women interviewed were married before and say what they have now is 
better. 
</P>
<P>
"We communicate without sex, without a home," one of the women said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say they encourage visits. But wives complain of mistreatment and 
rudeness by prison officials and say that rules are applied inconsistently. 
During their visits, the women must walk through a metal detector. Sometimes, 
they are patted down. They must comply with a dress code by not wearing overly 
revealing clothing. They may give their husbands a hug and kiss upon arriving, 
and the same upon leaving. 
</P>
<P>
"They (the officers) have the upper hand and they're shoving it in our faces," 
one woman said after a Sunday visit. ". . . I was raised to respect law and 
order. I've never been treated like I've been treated at San Quentin." 
</P>
<P>
Before a woman can wed a condemned man, she must write a letter to the prison 
detailing the crime for which her fiance was convicted. Still, the women insist 
that their husbands are not guilty of the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm prepared to go on with what I'm doing if they should execute (him)," said 
a wife who spends much of her time attempting to exonerate her husband. "But I 
also have a bottle of wine and a jar of spaghetti sauce for our first dinner."

ABORTION PLAINTIFFS NOW ON OPPOSITE SIDES;

<P>
SIMILAR PASTS, DIFFERENT VIEWPOINTS FOR ROE, DOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
ATLANTA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They tell strikingly similar personal histories. Both say they were born to 
dirt-poor families in the South, both were high-school dropouts who were 
married as teen-agers to abusive men and, for much of their lives, both have 
led turbulent, Gypsy-like existences. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen years ago, they both also were immortalized in American law in 
companion cases -- the well-known Roe vs. Wade and the obscure but no less 
judicially important Doe vs. Bolton -- which established a constitutional right 
for women to have abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, Norma Nelson McCorvey of Dallas and Sandra Race Cano of 
Atlanta, both 41, are on opposite sides of the highly contentious and often 
volatile abortion issue. 
</P>
<P>
McCorvey, the "Jane Roe" of Roe vs. Wade, is a passionate defender of the 1973 
Supreme Court ruling that she is fond of calling "my law." 
</P>
<P>
"I put my life on the line every day, but I can't think of one person who 
really believes in what they believe in and doesn't," said McCorvey, a 
diminutive, peppery woman who is known as "Pixie" to her friends. "I believe in 
choice. I'm pro-choice and pro-family." 
</P>
<P>
Cano (pronounced KAH-noh), the "Mary Doe" of Doe vs. Bolton, is an outspoken 
foe of abortion who contends that her role in helping to legalize the operation 
was a mistake that she has regretted since the day the Supreme Court handed 
down its landmark decision. 
</P>
<P>
She contends that she was manipulated by her attorneys in the case bearing her 
pseudonym and that she never wanted an abortion, never got an abortion and has 
always opposed abortion. 
</P>
<P>
"I was plain old used," said Cano, a soft-spoken woman with an engaging, 
down-home manner. "I never had any idea of what Doe vs. Bolton was about. I was 
kept in the dark by my former attorneys. I'm working now to get the case 
reconsidered and reversed. I want to stop abortions." 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court may spare her the effort. The high tribunal is expected to 
rule, possibly as early as this week, in a case originating in Missouri that 
could restore the authority of states to restrict or even outlaw abortion. 
</P>
<P>
The case, known as Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services, is widely 
considered as the broadest challenge to abortion rights since the court's 
historic 7-2 votes in the Roe and Doe decisions. Among other things, the 
Missouri law declares that life begins at conception and bans the use of public 
funds and facilities to perform abortions. 
</P>
<P>
In the two months since Webster was argued before the nine justices, the 
abortion issue has become even more heated, marked by rallies, demonstrations 
and continuing debate. Of all the words that have been spoken in that time, few 
are more compelling than those of the women behind the cases that lit the 
original fire under abortion rights -- Norma McCorvey and Sandra Cano. 
</P>
<P>
Although both have become symbols of the opposite ends of the polarizing 
controversy -- as each readily acknowledged in interviews last week -- it did 
not start out that way. Nineteen years ago, when their cases were filed, both 
were troubled young women, seemingly destined to be no more than faces in the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
McCorvey was a ticket seller for a carnival freak show who was unmarried and 
pregnant for the third time. Cano, who was married to a man later convicted of 
kidnaping and child molestation, said she had gone to the Atlanta Legal Aid 
Society months before for help in getting a divorce and unwittingly ended up as 
Mary Doe. 
</P>
<P>
But, they both agree, their stories really begin long before then. 
</P>
<P>
McCorvey, the daughter of an Army private and a waitress who were divorced when 
she was 13, dropped out of high school in Dallas at 16. At 17, she married 
24-year-old Woody McCorvey, a twice-divorced sheet-metal worker whom she had 
known only about six weeks before their marriage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moved to Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
The newlyweds moved from Dallas to Los Angeles -- "I always dreamed of being a 
movie star," she recalled last week during a telephone interview from the 
office of Los Angeles activist lawyer Gloria Allred. A month after reaching 
California, McCorvey learned that she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
But when she told her husband the news, she said, he accused her of cheating on 
him and "knocked me from the kitchen to the living room." 
</P>
<P>
When Woody left, she changed the locks, sold some personal belongings and moved 
back with her mother in Dallas. She worked in a bar until her daughter, whom 
she named Cheryl, was born on May 24, 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, she relinquished custody of Cheryl to her mother and began working 
a succession of odd jobs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, she found herself pregnant again, but she did not want the child -- 
another girl -- and agreed to turn it over to the father, letting him adopt 
her. She also agreed never to try to contact him or the girl after that -- a 
bargain she said that she has lived up to ever since. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea where he is or where she is," she said, but "if she has any of 
my blood, she's probably fighting for some worthy cause." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pregnant Again 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, while working for the carnival freak show, she became 
pregnant once more. This time, however, she wanted an abortion because, she 
said, she could not afford to keep the baby. 
</P>
<P>
There was one catch. At that time, Texas law permitted abortions only to save 
the life of the woman, so she resigned herself to carrying the baby to term and 
then giving it up. But when she went to an attorney to discuss arrangements for 
an adoption, he told her that he knew of two other Dallas lawyers -- Sarah 
Weddington and Linda Coffee -- who were seeking a plaintiff to contest Texas' 
abortion statute. 
</P>
<P>
McCorvey agreed to meet with Weddington and Coffee at a pizza parlor and 
discuss the matter. McCorvey, then 22 and eight weeks pregnant, was crestfallen 
when Weddington said that she could not guarantee that the case would be 
decided in time to help her. 
</P>
<P>
But when Weddington pointed out that McCorvey might be able to help women 
coming after her and asked if she would be willing to see the case through to 
the Supreme Court, McCorvey responded: "Let's go for it!" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Third Child Born 
</P>
<P>
McCorvey's third baby, which she had signed over for adoption, was born in 
June, 1970. She held the baby only momentarily. A nurse mistakenly brought it 
into her hospital room but rushed back in and snatched it back when she 
realized her error, leaving McCorvey in tears. 
</P>
<P>
McCorvey said she did not even have time to see whether the child was a girl or 
a boy. 
</P>
<P>
Three years later, the Supreme Court ruling in her favor was handed down. 
</P>
<P>
McCorvey, then self-employed as a house painter, learned of the decision on her 
way home from work. 
</P>
<P>
"I had stopped at the store to pick up a paper and some bread and some other 
stuff," she recalled. "Down in the lower right-hand corner of the paper it 
said: 'U.S. Supreme Court Hands Down 7-2 Decision Legalizing Abortion in 
Texas.' " 
</P>
<P>
For the next seven years, McCorvey kept a low profile, reluctant to tell even 
her closest friends that she was the Jane Roe of the Roe vs. Wade decision. But 
then one day, she said, she read a newspaper story that claimed not only was 
Jane Roe a fictitious name but a non-existent person. 
</P>
<P>
McCorvey, infuriated, decided to go public with her story. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the beginning of my activist career," she said. "It hasn't been easy. 
I'm really a very shy person." 
</P>
<P>
She also has been the target of, among other things, eggs thrown at her house 
and car and baby clothes strewn on her front lawn. Two months ago, just before 
she planned to attend a pro-choice rally in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the 
National Organization for Women, three shotgun blasts were fired at her house 
and car. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Blood on the Streets' 
</P>
<P>
She fears that the Supreme Court may reverse Roe vs. Wade when it rules in the 
Webster case. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope they don't," she said. "There will just be blood on the streets from 
women trying to get illegal abortions if they do. Women will get abortions, 
whether they're legal or illegal." 
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, the story of Sandra Cano begins much like that of Norma McCorvey, 
but then takes its own peculiar twists. 
</P>
<P>
Cano, the eldest of six children born to an Atlanta sanitation worker and his 
wife, said she was 17 and a ninth-grade dropout when her parents forced her 
into a "shotgun" wedding with her first date, Joel Lee Bensing, in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-age newlyweds moved into her parents' three-room house on Atlanta's 
far South Side, and the next year in May, Cano gave birth to her first child, a 
boy who was named Joel Lee Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Cano and her husband never had much of a marriage, she recalled in interviews 
here. "We were never together over a week or two at any one time," she said. 
"He was only around long enough to make me pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
She said that she also was unaware at this time of his proclivity for sexually 
molesting young children. Her parents knew, she said, "but they didn't tell 
me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Life Chaotic 
</P>
<P>
In November of the following year, Cano gave birth to her second child, a girl 
she named April. 
</P>
<P>
Life in her mother's home was chaotic at best, she said. Once, Cano recalled, 
when she was pregnant with her third child, her mother took her and her two 
children to a downtown Atlanta homeless shelter to get them out from underfoot. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no money with me or anything," Cano said. "They gave you a little bed to 
sleep on, but once you're in, you're up at 6 in the morning and then they feed 
you breakfast and then you're not allowed back in till 6 at night." 
</P>
<P>
This ordeal lasted about a week, with Cano and her children spending the 
daylight hours on the streets, tired, dirty and often hungry. 
</P>
<P>
When her third child, Lisa, was born in 1969, Cano had moved from Atlanta and 
was living with her husband in Dallas. But she gave the baby up for adoption 
two months later, feeling that she just could not care for her and the two 
other children properly. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime during the years 1968 and 1969, she said, when she was living in 
Atlanta, her mother swore out a warrant and had her committed to the state 
mental institution in Milledgeville. But, she said, she managed to escape after 
two or three days and was never forced to return. 
</P>
<P>
Also during the same period, she said, juvenile authorities took Joel Lee Jr. 
and April away from her and placed them in foster care. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wanted a Divorce 
</P>
<P>
In early 1970, pregnant again by her husband with their fourth child, she said 
she decided to get a divorce and went to the Atlanta Legal Aid Society for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
From here on, the accounts of her life become contradictory. 
</P>
<P>
According to Cano's own recollection, when she asked for legal aid, she was 
told that she could get assistance not only in getting a divorce but in getting 
back the two children that had been placed in foster care. 
</P>
<P>
"But there was one little thing they said they would like me to help them do," 
she said. That was, she said, to join a class-action suit challenging Georgia's 
restrictive abortion laws. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they didn't tell me in straight words: 'You do this for me (and) I'll do 
this for you,' " she said. But, she added, she felt as if she were obligated to 
follow their suggestions, even though she was not fully aware of what she was 
getting into by becoming a plaintiff in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
On April 16, 1970, Doe vs. Bolton was filed in federal District Court in 
Atlanta. The next month, on the 15th, the case was heard before a three-judge 
panel. Sixteen days later, the judges handed down a ruling striking down key 
parts of Georgia's abortion law. Both sides appealed, and the appeal went 
straight to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, said Cano, the lawyers who handled Doe vs. Bolton for the plaintiffs 
had arranged for her to get an abortion in early May at Georgia Baptist 
Hospital. But when she discovered what they had done, she fled to Oklahoma, 
seeking refuge with her husband's grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
"I never wanted an abortion," she said. "I didn't go to them for an abortion." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Records Tell Another Story 
</P>
<P>
She added that she only came back to Atlanta for the hearing in the Doe case 
June 15 because she had been assured that she would not be coerced into an 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
But according to various court documents, records, published reports and 
interviews with attorneys involved in Doe vs. Bolton, the story is somewhat 
different. 
</P>
<P>
They reveal, for example, that Cano did, indeed, seek help from the Atlanta 
Legal Aid Society in getting a divorce but that she reunited with her husband 
sometime in early 1970 -- and that was that. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in April, she returned to the legal aid organization after having her 
application rejected for an abortion at Grady Memorial Hospital, a downtown 
public hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Margie Pitts Hames, an Atlanta lawyer and the lead attorney in Doe vs. Bolton, 
said Cano talked with various attorneys at the legal aid society about getting 
assistance in having an abortion at another hospital, if she could. 
</P>
<P>
Hames, who was not part of the legal aid society staff but headed a team of 
lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union helping to put together the Doe 
suit, said that she was then called in to meet with Cano at the legal aid 
office. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Talked With Lawyer 
</P>
<P>
"We talked about her being a plaintiff and what that meant, and that she might 
have to testify and say why she wanted an abortion," Hames said. "She wanted to 
know if her name would have to be used. We said she could use Mary Doe." 
</P>
<P>
Hames said that Cano agreed, and the suit -- Doe vs. Bolton -- was filed. 
</P>
<P>
Then her application at Georgia Baptist was finally approved on March 5, but 
Cano refused to go through with the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Hames said that Cano remained a willing plaintiff and signed the 
affidavit in March, 1971, for the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
"She also appeared in my office in 1973, in which she gave an interview to a 
network television reporter," she said. "Her face did not show to preserve her 
anonymity. The gist of the interview she gave was that she didn't benefit from 
the decision but she was glad other women had the right to choose." 
</P>
<P>
Cano said that she does not remember what she told the reporter, but that when 
she learned of the Supreme Court ruling in her case, she was sickened. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like something came over me, like a gloom, like a weight or burden or 
something," she said. "I felt like this ain't right. It was like something in 
me, like something was weighted in me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gave Up Her Child 
</P>
<P>
Her fourth child, Melissa, was born in November and given up for adoption. But, 
as a result of recent publicity, the two found each other, and now Melissa and 
Melissa's two children live with Cano. 
</P>
<P>
In March of 1971, after her husband pleaded guilty to charges in the kidnaping 
of an 8-year-old girl and was sentenced to three concurrent 20-year terms in 
prison, she divorced him. 
</P>
<P>
She has been married three times since. Her present husband, Nino Cano, is a 
Mexican immigrant, with whom she lives in a one-bedroom apartment on Atlanta's 
Southeast Side. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, she has been a highly visible and vocal part of the 
demonstration staged in Atlanta by the militant anti-abortion group known as 
Operation Rescue. 
</P>
<P>
Cano also has been a target of crime. Last February, both her car and her 
husband's pickup were shot at with pistols. The truck later was stolen. Another 
truck that he bought to replace it also was stolen just this month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE ROE AND DOE RULINGS 
</P>
<P>
On Jan. 22, 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7 to 2 in the landmark abortion 
cases of Roe vs. Wade and Doe vs. Bolton. Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote the 
majority opinions; Justices William H. Rehnquist and Byron R. White dissented. 
Here is what the majority decided: 
</P>
<P>

SOVIET CONGRESS SEEKS REFORM CONSTITUTION 
</P>

<P>
In a manifesto for further reform, the new Soviet national assembly on Saturday 
outlined a legislative program aimed at accelerating the pace of the Soviet 
Union's political, economic and social changes and broadening their scope. 
</P>
<P>
The Congress of People's Deputies, summing up its first session, called for the 
drafting of a new constitution, incorporating the dramatic political reforms of 
the past two years and providing greater protection of individual rights and 
clearer limits on the authority of the government and the ruling Communist 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
Key measures include immediate constitutional amendments that "recognize the 
inalienable rights of the individual to life, freedom, inviolability and 
security," a complete judicial reform with the establishment of an independent 
court system within a year and the adoption of basic laws on freedom of 
religious belief, of the press and of association. 
</P>
<P>
The congress, noting that the country remains in a deep economic crisis, also 
demanded a faster pace of economic reform, with decisive steps to move from 
nearly total state ownership and central planning to a mixed economy operating 
on the market principles of supply and demand with a strong role for individual 
entrepreneurs and cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
And in an effort to resolve the country's increasingly acute ethnic conflicts, 
the congress proposed development of a federal structure that would give the 15 
constituent Soviet republics real political and economic authority as well as 
measures that will restore the rights of minorities, such as the Crimean 
Tatars, Volga Germans and Meskhetian Turks, who were deported from their homes 
decades ago to remote regions by dictator Josef Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies called upon the Supreme Soviet, which is now a permanent national 
legislature, to take urgent action to solve the severe shortages of food and 
consumer goods, to expand the construction of new housing, to improve education 
and health care and to raise old-age pensions and payments to families with 
incomes below the poverty line. 
</P>
<P>
They propose further cuts in the country's defense budget to finance some of 
the increased spending as well as greater utilization of the space program in 
economic development. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adopted June 9 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted by the new congress at the end of its two-week session 
June 9 but not published until Saturday, provides the Soviet Union's basic 
domestic and foreign policy guidelines -- the first time that a national 
assembly here has laid down such a framework for the government. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals will be put before the 542-member Supreme Soviet, which was 
elected from among the congress' 2,250 deputies to function as a full-time 
legislature, when it reconvenes in Moscow on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Among the items on the agenda will be the confirmation of Premier Nikolai I. 
Ryzhkov's Cabinet. Several nominees, already rejected by commissions that have 
been examining their qualifications and questioning them about government 
policies, will face a serious struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Although the reforms begun by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev are now in their 
fifth year, "the country has not yet emerged from its crisis," the resolution 
said, noting that in some respects the problems have grown even more acute. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Evolving With Difficulty' 
</P>
<P>
Perestroika, or restructuring, as the reforms are known, "is evolving with 
difficulty and in a contradictory way, and the state of affairs in the country 
remains complex and strained," the resolution said, according to the official 
Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
The deputies said that "cumbersome managerial machinery" is blocking the most 
basic economic reforms and "is curbing the initiative of the masses." Problems 
such as a psychological dependence on orders from above, equal pay for everyone 
and a social shortsightedness are also hampering the reforms, according to the 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Their solution to these problems is to press ahead with the reforms while 
trying to minimize the inevitable difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
Calling for a "further deepening of the economic reform," the congress 
instructed both the Council of Ministers and the Supreme Soviet to work out a 
program centered on the "stage-by-stage transition" to a "socialist market," 
where supply and demand will supplant the state's allocation of resources and 
where private and cooperative firms will compete with state enterprises on the 
same basis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Republics to Take the Lead 
</P>
<P>
The first legislative steps should be taken in the coming year, the congress 
said, with the adoption of laws guaranteeing the rights of such new 
enterprises, authorizing the leasing of state-owned property to private 
entrepreneurs wanting to operate their own businesses, shifting state 
enterprises from a system of "profits delivery" to taxation and permitting 
constituent republics, starting with Estonia and Lithuania, to take the lead in 
developing such mixed economies. 
</P>
<P>
Other elements of the economic reform package, certain to prove controversial, 
include the development of a capital market to manage investments; a program to 
convert much more of the defense industry to civilian production; a 
liberalization of foreign trade; the reduction of exports of oil, gas and other 
raw materials with the expansion of exports of manufactured goods, and making 
the ruble, the Soviet currency, convertible on international markets on a 
gradual basis. 
</P>
<P>
In foreign policy, the deputies called for "ensuring the country's security 
first of all by political means, the elimination of nuclear weapons through 
negotiation and the exclusion of the use of force or threat of force to attain 
any political, economic or other goals." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Foreign Policy Cited 
</P>
<P>
They also called for reforms in the way that Soviet foreign policy is made so 
that there is "a reliable procedure capable of fully precluding undemocratic 
and secret foreign policy decision-making in the future." 
</P>
<P>
In urging a further improvement in relations with the United States, the 
deputies said that the Soviet Union must increase its efforts to "bring an end 
to the arms race."

THREE MAJOR OIL SPILLS HIT U.S. WITHIN 13 HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Major oil spills threatened Rhode Island, Delaware and Texas on Saturday after 
three shipping accidents in just over 12 hours unleashed an estimated 2.55 
million gallons of oil. 
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary sequence of events began Friday afternoon in Narragansett 
Bay, not far from fashionable Newport, when the Greek-registered tanker World 
Prodigy ran aground on Brenton Reef, tearing holes in the vessel and releasing 
up to 1.5 million gallons of light heating oil into the bay, the Coast Guard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
800,000 Gallons 
</P>
<P>
About 12 hours later, as much as 800,000 gallons of oil -- heavy No. 6 crude -- 
oozed into the Delaware River after the Uruguayan-registered Presidente Rivera 
ran aground near the town of Claymont, upriver from Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
Sandwiched between those huge spills was the estimated loss of 250,000 gallons 
of heavy crude oil that dumped into the Houston Ship Channel near La Porte, 
Tex., late Friday when a tug-driven barge was punctured and lost its load after 
colliding with a Panamanian-registered tanker. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the situation in Valdez, Alaska, where 11 million gallons of crude oil 
were spilled in the grounding of the Exxon Valdez on March 24, government and 
environmental workers moved quickly in an effort to combat all three spills. 
</P>
<P>
The White House, which had been criticized for its slow response to the Alaska 
disaster, dispatched William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency, and Manuel Lujan Jr., secretary of the Interior, to survey 
the scene here shortly after midnight, only hours after the 4:30 p.m. accident. 
</P>
<P>
By Saturday, emergency crews in New England were working to prevent major 
environmental damage, but ribbons of heating oil befouled 20 beaches and coves 
in Rhode Island Sound during the day, forcing officials to close beaches and 
shellfishing beds. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of workers scrambled to clean the flood of No. 2 oil that poured from 
the 560-foot Greek tanker after it hit a reef marked by an 87-foot light tower 
only a mile from this famed resort town. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Criminal, Civil Charges 
</P>
<P>
State officials said they expect to file criminal and civil charges against 
Iakova Georgudis, the captain of the World Prodigy, and the ship's Athens-based 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
Rhode Island Gov. Edward DiPrete said the tanker had entered the busy 
Narragansett Bay harbor without a pilot, in violation of state law. He told 
reporters the captain "acknowledged an error in course adjustment" while 
turning the tanker. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'I made a mistake,' " DiPrete said after interviewing the captain. "I 
said, 'A very serious mistake and a lot of people are paying for it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Georgudis showed no signs of being under the influence of alcohol or drugs when 
questioned by officials, a Coast Guard spokeswoman said in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Crews moved to surround the ship with about 3,000 feet of booms. Other 
absorbent booms were set to protect sensitive salt marshes and coves on 
Narragansett Bay. Crews used dozens of trucks and boats to skim pools of oil 
from the water. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complaints of Fumes 
</P>
<P>
Tourists who flock here to visit the 70-room summer "cottages" of John Jacob 
Astor and Cornelius Vanderbilt instead took pictures of the crippled tanker. 
Many complained of the noxious fumes that permeated the town Friday night, but 
every Newport hotel was full Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the spill was far less serious than the one off Valdez three 
months ago that killed thousands of birds and other wildlife and fouled 
hundreds of miles of coastline with a heavier type of oil. 
</P>
<P>
Affected beaches here were not blackened, but had a thin, oily sheen near the 
water's edge. More important, the No. 2 oil floats on the surface and 
evaporates quickly. 
</P>
<P>
"This oil is very much like gasoline," said Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer 
Rick Meidt. "The scientists say 80% to 90% will evaporate within three days." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Disappears Rapidly' 
</P>
<P>
Gary Ott, a federal science support coordinator, said the oil would evaporate 
as it washed in and out of the bay on the tide. He said the oil is "much more 
toxic" than in the Alaskan spill, but "fortunately it disappears incredibly 
rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
"The best thing that could happen now is a couple of days of hot sun to help it 
evaporate, and then heavy rains to break up the rest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Trude Coxe, head of the Save the Bay environmental group, said she knew of only 
one oil-fouled bird. "It could be a lot worse," she said. "Because the Coast 
Guard moved so quickly, they prevented this from being a real disaster." 
</P>
<P>
Gov. DiPrete said the state was using 250 state employees and 120 inmates from 
the state prison to help clean up. He also ordered a part mobilization of about 
200 members of the Rhode Island National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Industrial Area 
</P>
<P>
A spill of similar proportions hit the Delaware River off Claymont, Del., early 
Saturday morning in an industrial area where many oil refineries and chemical 
plants line the river banks. The Coast Guard had estimated the spill as large 
as 1.6 million gallons, but later lowered the figure. 
</P>
<P>
The oil, moving with the tide, stretched for 15 miles along the Delaware shore. 
Because it was No. 6 oil, used for industrial heating, it solidified into globs 
and began to sink below the surface, rather than forming a slick. 
</P>
<P>
Two private contractors were hired by the ship's owners to contain the spill 
and remove the oil from the water. By midday Saturday, there were nine vessels 
involved in the cleanup, the ship was surrounded by oil booms and its remaining 
cargo of oil was being transferred to barges. 
</P>
<P>
"The fortunate thing is that this oil is not toxic and is not soluble in 
water," said James Weakley, a marine safety officer at Coast Guard headquarters 
in Philadelphia. "The impact on fish and shellfish will be minimal. There is 
some risk to waterfowl if they get entangled with the oil globs." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Investigation Starts 
</P>
<P>
The Presidente Rivera went aground in the Delaware River at 4:46 a.m. A river 
pilot aboard the vessel notified the Coast Guard of the accident. An 
investigation was launched by the Coast Guard to determine why the 749-foot 
tanker, carrying about 18 million gallons of oil to Sun Co., at Marcus Hook, 
Pa., south of Philadelphia, strayed from the shipping lane and went aground, 
Weakley said. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth major spill in the Delaware River area since 1985, the Coast 
Guard spokesman added. 
</P>
<P>
The third spill, which temporarily closed the busy Houston Ship Channel, 
occurred at 6:20 p.m. Friday when a barge loaded with 6,000 barrels of crude 
oil collided with the Panamanian-registered tanker Rachel-B near Houston. The 
channel connects Galveston Bay and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Chief Mark Kennedy said favorable winds pushed most of a 
two-mile-long oil slick into the ship channel, which was making cleanup efforts 
easier. Some oil washed up on a little-used beach in the La Porte industrial 
area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Pristine' 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a pristine area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lois Epstein, an environmental engineer with the Environmental Defense Fund in 
Washington, said she was not surprised by the rising number of oil spills since 
the total use of oil and transportation of oil were rising rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
"An analogy would be that if there are more cars on the road, driving more 
miles, you're going to have more (auto) accidents," she said. 
</P>
<P>

Washington. Staff writer J. Michael Kennedy in Houston also contributed to this 
story.

South Korean riot troops backed by fire trucks raided a university campus 
before dawn and arrested 21 students accused of organizing violent 
anti-government protests. About 3,500 police searched two buildings at Hanyang 
University in eastern Seoul for student leaders, police said. Meanwhile, in the 
southern provincial capital of Kwangju, news reports said about 400 radical 
students armed with firebombs and steel bars attacked prosecutors' offices, 
burning two cars and injuring five police officers. Demonstrators accused the 
government of concealing facts about the death last month of a student 
activist.

Angolan government and rebel forces honored the first day of a truce in the 
14-year war between the Marxist government and Western-backed rebels. 
"Hostilities have ceased, but it is necessary to keep vigilance and be ready 
for combat so that the peace that has been launched becomes real and lasting," 
Interior Minister Francisco Magalhaes Paiva said. Angolans crowded around 
newspaper stands in the capital of Luanda looking for more details of the 
cease-fire accord that went into effect two days after it was signed by 
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and rebel leader Jonas Savimbi at an African 
summit in Gbadolite, Zaire.

New York will build the nation's first prison exclusively for drug addicts and 
alcoholics as part of an $886.6-million plan to put 7,100 more inmates behind 
bars, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders said. The deal calls for 
construction of six new medium-security prisons scattered across Upstate New 
York. It will also create seven "annexes" built onto existing prisons that 
would provide drug treatment and counseling for inmates within two years of 
parole eligibility. The new drug prison, to be built at a cost of $65 million 
near the U.S. Army Depot in Romulus, Seneca County, will offer comprehensive 
treatment.

Cuba's military said it will shoot down private planes violating Cuban airspace 
on grounds they probably are engaged in drug smuggling. "We will be obliged to 
shoot, however disagreeable it might be, at whatever aircraft . . . refuses to 
obey orders to land for inspection," according to a report published in Granma, 
the Communist Party daily. The armed forces also announced that a 47-member 
military honor tribunal will convene today in the case of two generals and five 
other officers accused of having links with a Colombian cocaine cartel. Last 
week, Granma published a report of a drug scandal that led to the arrests of 
the seven, including Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez, one of Cuba's most decorated

The mayor of St. Louis and his family went into hiding and a city airport 
commissioner was arrested after the commissioner allegedly made threats when 
yet another city official -- his ex-wife -- was relieved of some duties. When 
Mayor Vincent C. Schoemehl Jr. later appeared at a Democratic meeting, he was 
accompanied by four police officers. Luther Boykins was arrested for allegedly 
threatening Schoemehl, police said. He was released a few hours later. Boykins 
allegedly made the threat after the mayor supported legislation that limited 
the duties of Boykins' ex-wife, Billie Boykins, the city's license collector. 
Billie Boykins also faces felony drug charges from an arrest near Bloomington,

said in Seattle. Boeing spokesman Paul Binder declined to provide details of 
the billing practices probe, but he did confirm that an investigation is under 
way. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported in its Saturday editions that it 
has obtained internal Boeing memos that say the company is under subpoena to 
preserve a wide assortment of documents. A memo dated June 13 named the target 
as the Sea Lance program, an anti-submarine weapon Boeing is developing for the 
Navy, the newspaper reported.

The key poison in the herbicide Agent Orange, used extensively in the Vietnam 
War, may kill animals but appears relatively harmless to people, experts in 
long-term studies said at the National Environmental Health Conference, which 
was held in San Antonio. Researchers presented the latest findings on 
large-scale studies of the effects of dioxin, the toxic ingredient of Agent 
Orange. Except for skin cancer, no major differences from normal levels were 
found in the cancer and heart disease rates of 1,261 U.S. soldiers exposed to 
the poison, according to a $50-million Air Force study. Also, no unusual deaths 
or illnesses were found in 40,000 people tracked in a University of Milan study 
following a 1979 Italian dioxin plant explosion that contaminated a nearby 
town.

During a wave of Chinese student demonstrations at the end of 1986, Jiang 
Zemin, then the mayor of Shanghai, noticed wallposters at one of the city's 
leading universities quoting the Gettysburg Address: "All men are created 
equal." 
</P>
<P>
The proud mayor immediately launched his own propaganda counteroffensive. As 
Jiang later boasted in an interview with this reporter and several other 
Western correspondents, he stood up before thousands of students at the school, 
Jiaotong University, and recited the entire Gettysburg Address to them -- in 
English. And then he told the students they didn't understand it. 
</P>
<P>
"You only know Lincoln's speech in words," he told the students. "You don't 
know the historical context of the speech." He proceeded to give the students a 
lecture whose message was that Chinese society is vastly different from that of 
the United States. Lincoln's address referred to American slavery, he 
explained, while China's Communist revolution was aimed at overcoming the 
exploitation of man by man. 
</P>
<P>
That story illustrates the character of the man who was appointed Saturday to 
be the new general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, Jiang is well educated, a linguist, quite familiar with the 
world outside China. He is likely to try to continue China's policy of opening 
to the outside world and seeking to attract foreign trade and investment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uphold Marxism-Leninism 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he is a firm believer in upholding traditional 
Marxist-Leninist ideology. Over the past three years, Jiang has repeatedly made 
clear his firm opposition to the demands for Western-style democracy and 
freedom of the press that have been pressed by Chinese students and 
intellectuals. 
</P>
<P>
"These students need re-education," Jiang said in the interview. "We have 
underestimated the influence of bourgeois liberalization (a Chinese phrase 
meaning Western influence) upon them." 
</P>
<P>
In Jiang's attitude toward the current generation of Chinese students, there 
was a strong undertone of generational resentment. He acted much like 
then-Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, who, during the Vietnam anti-war 
protests of the late 1960s, once snarled at a group of student demonstrators, 
"When I was a student at Berkeley, we were much tougher than you are." 
</P>
<P>
Jiang recalled that he himself had graduated from Jiaotong University, the same 
Shanghai school where he had observed wallposters of the Gettysburg Address. 
"Their (living) conditions there now are much better than ours were," he said. 
" . . . These students, they lack the deep, real knowledge of Chinese history 
and the Chinese revolution." 
</P>
<P>
There is considerable irony in Jiang's appointment Saturday. For, as he 
recalled in that interview two years ago, his rise to become mayor of Shanghai 
-- the job that launched his career in top-level Chinese politics -- was helped 
by, among others, Zhao Ziyang, the man he is now replacing as party chief. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1984, Jiang was working in Beijing as China's minister of the 
electronics industry when Zhao, then China's premier, made an inspection tour 
of Shanghai. Zhao brought Jiang with him. 
</P>
<P>
The issues at that time were strictly economic ones -- then, there were no 
student demonstrations in the city. Shanghai's economy was a mess, and its 
industry was decaying and unproductive. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang was a logical companion for Zhao. He was the head of one of China's most 
important industrial ministries. Moreover, as he later told reporters, Jiang's 
wife was from Shanghai. Jiang himself had gone to school and university there 
and had worked there on two previous occasions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mayor of Shanghai 
</P>
<P>
The following year, in 1985, with Zhao's backing, Jiang was appointed Shanghai 
mayor. It is one of the hardest and most important jobs in Chinese politics, 
and Jiang admitted he had mixed feelings about taking the position. 
</P>
<P>
"To be a mayor is more difficult than being a minister. When I was working as a 
minister in Beijing, I didn't have to worry about the weather and the food 
supply. That was (the mayor of Beijing's) problem," he said. " . . . As mayor, 
you have to handle everything -- food, housing, toilets, everything. For 
example, the Shanghainese are very demanding about getting fresh vegetables." 
</P>
<P>
He sprinkles his conversation with Chinese folk wisdom. When Jiang wanted to 
demonstrate his determined optimism about the future of Shanghai, he quipped: 
"There's an old saying, 'When Lao (Old Man) Wang sells his melons, he always 
says they are sweet. He never says they are bitter.' " 
</P>
<P>
In personal style, Jiang is jocular and informal. In the interview, he wore a 
Western shirt and tie -- but coupled that with a zippered sweat-suit jacket 
instead of a sports jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Like Premier Li Peng, the 62-year-old Jiang has a chubby face and a paunchy 
midriff -- a reminder that, unlike the older generation who made the Long 
March, China's current crop of leaders now get plenty of food and not much 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bound by Tradition 
</P>
<P>
Despite his knowledge of English, Jiang conducted that March, 1987, interview 
in Chinese, speaking to reporters through a translator. That is the traditional 
format for interviews with foreign correspondents in China, and Jiang did not 
appear to be the sort of person anxious to break with tradition. 
</P>
<P>
He seemed eager to reassure foreigners that, despite the ouster of 
then-Communist Party General Secretary Hu Yaobang two months earlier and the 
party's ideological campaign against "bourgeois liberalization," China in 
general and Shanghai in particular remained open to foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Jiang suggested to reporters, the entire crackdown on student 
demonstrations at the beginning of 1987 was aimed at protecting China's policy 
of opening to the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
"If the masses are striking on the street, how can we attract the foreign 
investors to . . . Shanghai?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
During the demonstrations in Shanghai in December, 1986, tens of thousands of 
students jammed Shanghai's streets. At one point, students at Jiaotong 
University had a tense, edgy confrontation with Jiang, their mayor. 
</P>
<P>
"The students told me they have the right to demonstrate," Jiang later told 
reporters. "I said, 'You have the right to demonstrate. The (Chinese) 
constitution says it. But I personally don't agree that you should. There are 
12 million people in Shanghai, and you can't guarantee there won't be people 
(in the demonstrations) who will commit crimes.' " 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Jiang told the students, "Shanghai is the old nest of the Gang of 
Four (the ultra-radicals who led the Cultural Revolution.) Those people would 
take advantage of these student demonstrations." 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Jiang was full of praise for Zhao Ziyang, then China's premier. 
Zhao had just become the acting Communist Party secretary, the heir-apparent to 
China's top leader, Deng Xiaoping. 
</P>
<P>
Zhao had taken over as party leader from Hu Yaobang, who had lost his job in 
part because of those huge student demonstrations in Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
"Our premier is a great premier," Jiang Zemin said at the time. "Why, his 
remarks about combatting the influence of bourgeois liberalization in China are 
just marvelous." 
</P>
<P>
Now, it will be up to Jiang, a true believer, to see if he can combat Western 
influence in China, after the failure and ouster of his two predecessors.

At least 31 people died Saturday and 50 were seriously hurt when a rural 
highway caved in and two crowded buses tumbled into a 100-foot hole, rescue 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred near the rural town of Estancia, about 1,150 miles 
northeast of Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
The buses, each jammed with 48 travelers, were making the 56-hour, 2,030-mile 
trek from the southeastern city of Sao Paulo to Natal, federal police officer 
Luis Fernando Borges Santos said. 
</P>
<P>
"They were riding along a high ridge when the road simply gave way beneath 
them," said Borges Santos, who assisted rescue workers at the scene. "A hole 
the diameter of two buses opened up and sucked them down the drop. It's pitch 
black out on that highway -- the drivers probably never saw a thing." 
</P>
<P>
One driver was killed but the other was pulled alive from the wreckage, Santos 
said.

REFORMER TO HEAD HUNGARY'S COMMUNIST PARTY 
</P>

This country's reform Communists won a decisive battle against conservatives 
Saturday when the party, in an unprecedented move, named prominent economist 
and reformer Rezso Nyers as the new Communist Party chairman and appointed a 
four-man team to steer party politics until the next Communist congress in 
October, Hungarian Radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
The decision effectively strips General Secretary Karoly Grosz, 58, of much of 
his power and places Hungary's leadership in the hands of a reform-minded 
majority that says it wants to transform Hungary into a socialist democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Grosz, who was hailed as a reformer as recently as 13 months ago when he took 
power from longtime Communist leader Janos Kadar, has come under increasing 
criticism in recent months as a fumbling centrist who lacks the vision to steer 
Hungary into the future. 
</P>
<P>
A Communist Party spokesman said that Grosz would retain the title of general 
secretary until the party congress, now set for Oct. 7, but that the party will 
be run by Grosz, Nyers, reformist Premier Miklos Nemeth, 42, and Minister of 
State and Politburo member Imre Pozsgay, 55. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The 'Hungarian Gorbachev' 
</P>
<P>
Pozsgay is called the "Hungarian Gorbachev" by some and is the country's most 
popular and closely watched reform politician. He is currently consolidating 
support from both party members and opposition groups and is widely expected to 
make his move for Hungary's leadership in October. 
</P>
<P>
Nyers, 65, who pioneered Hungary's first economic reforms in the late 1960s but 
was ousted from the Politburo in 1973 for advocating rapid change, is enjoying 
a comeback today that is rare among East Bloc politicians. He was renamed to 
the Politburo in May, 1988, when Grosz took office as part of the progressive 
wind that also swept Pozsgay into his Politburo seat. 
</P>
<P>
Nyers assumes an honorary position created for Janos Kadar when he was deposed 
as general secretary, but the reinstated reformer has told the Hungarian press 
that he intends to play more than just a ceremonial role, although it is not 
clear how much power he will actually have. The post has been empty since the 
Politburo stripped Kadar, now 77 and in ailing health, of that title last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the party also announced that hard-liner Janos Berecz, a former 
Communist Party secretary for ideology and propaganda, would head an institute 
for political science that has not yet been founded. This announcement, along 
with the others made on Hungarian Radio on Saturday, indicate that Hungary's 
reformers have won a battle against hard-liners during a protracted Central 
Committee meeting that started Friday morning and continued into Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition party leaders hailed the news. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that with the leadership of Pozsgay and Nyers, a new party can be 
born," said Gabor Demszky, a leader of the Alliance of Free Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary has made great strides toward economic and political reform in the past 
13 months, but critics say Grosz has not kept pace and has in fact angered many 
Hungarians by his contradictory and often unclear comments. 
</P>
<P>
The general secretary has also been unable to resolve a growing and now openly 
admitted rift between party progressives and more orthodox Communists. 
</P>
<P>
Reform Communists, who are looking ahead to multi-party elections that could be 
held by the end of this year, say they must consolidate their numbers and gain 
the upper hand in the party's leadership if they hope to win public support at 
the polls. 
</P>
<P>
While leading Communists hesitate to criticize Grosz by name, Hungarian 
Parliament Speaker Matyas Szuros said Thursday: "A politician who is 
inconsistent and makes contradictory statements discredits himself. . . . We 
have to prepare for the congress with a leadership whose members are at least 
in solidarity with one another and act in harmony." 
</P>
<P>
Rumors that Grosz would resign have abounded for several months. They were 
fueled last week when Grosz failed to appear at a meeting with opposition 
groups who are working with the Communists to hammer out new property and 
election legislation that will then be given to the National Assembly, or 
Parliament, to approve. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Communist delegation was chaired by Pozsgay. Nyers and Pozsgay 
have also gained high marks for attending the ceremony honoring former 
Hungarian Premier Imre Nagy, who was given a patriot's burial June 16 after 
being executed as a traitor for his role in the 1956 uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Grosz, as leader of the Communist Party, was pointedly excluded from the 
ceremony by its organizers. He had further angered many by his remarks about 
the Communist Party's attitude toward Nagy, who is now officially recognized as 
having been executed after a show trial.

ALL-NIGHT COUNSELING SESSION HAS TURNED INTO A NIGHTMARE FOR WOMEN'S TRACK 
COACH, OTHER OFFICIALS IN LSU ATHLETIC PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
BATON ROUGE, La. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the very day that Coach Loren Seagrave and the women's track and field team 
from Louisiana State University were assembled in the rotunda of the city hall 
here to collect keys to the city -- awarded on the occasion of the team's 
having won its second indoor national title -- two parallel events were 
unfolding. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, though, was coming together too late. As some tell it now, in 
their legal complaints and depositions, even as Seagrave was attending the 
ceremony last April 12, there were individuals in the LSU athletic department 
who were on the phone to Baton Rouge city officials, frantically trying to stop 
the presentation. "Don't give that man the damn key," was the reported gist of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was not stopped. Seagrave and his team were made honorary 
mayor-presidents by the Metro Council and some individuals across town at LSU 
were made to seethe. 
</P>
<P>
The other event had unfolded, quite literally, earlier in the day, as sleepy 
residents of this capital city opened their editions of the Morning Advocate to 
see a sensational story at the top of the sports section. 
</P>
<P>
It told of how Seagrave, who is married, received a call from one of his female 
athletes late one night in July of 1988. According to the story, she said was 
distraught and needed to talk to him. Seagrave picked the athlete up at her 
apartment and drove her to a vacant house that he occasionally rented. 
</P>
<P>
His wife was out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Seagrave said that he and the athlete were at the house for several hours and 
left about 6 a.m. He said that during the all-night counseling session, he had 
hugged the athlete, who has never been named, and kissed her on the cheek, but 
that nothing of a sexual nature occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Almost a year later, the woman's boyfriend threatened Seagrave that he would 
tell "the real story" of that night. Seagrave preempted that threat by telling 
his version of the encounter to Pat Henry, LSU's men's track coach. Henry took 
the story to Athletic Director Joe Dean. 
</P>
<P>
Within a week, Seagrave, who engineered his team's phenomenal success -- LSU 
has won the women's indoor and outdoor national titles for two consecutive 
years, an unprecedented feat, five national titles overall -- was fired, after 
six years at the school. He has never been given a reason for his termination, 
which university officials say is in accordance with policy. Seagrave, though, 
is suing. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, that April 12 was a busy day in Baton Rouge. Among other things, it 
was the official opening day of what people here are calling Tigergate. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Seagrave's firing have surfaced allegations of all manner of 
improper behavior -- racial and sex discrimination, recruiting violations, drug 
use, professional indiscretion, out-of-control school administrators, outdated 
state laws and a conspiracy to oust a man who some folks around here consider 
LSU's most successful coach ever. 
</P>
<P>
To no one's great surprise, the entire mess is scheduled to land in court, 
where, if all the ungodly stories are repeated, there may be some very shocked 
spectators. 
</P>
<P>
The heat here has been all but unbearable lately. Considering Loren Seagrave's 
recent experiences, that can be taken both ways. On this particular Tuesday in 
June, however, it is simply hot and humid in a way that is energy-sapping. 
</P>
<P>
This is the day Seagrave and his wife, Kathy Freeman, must move out of Apt. 1 
at the Plantation Town Apartments in southeast Baton Rouge. They must put their 
belongings in storage, go to track practice and finish packing for Houston, 
where some of the athletes Seagrave coaches will compete in the national 
championships. The next day they will all fly to Europe for the first half of 
the summer track season there. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the group is Dawn Sowell, hailed by many as the world's next great 
sprinter. 
</P>
<P>
It is not the best day for Seagrave to sit with a reporter and give his first 
lengthy interview since his dismissal. But he is doing it. He is listening to 
the allegations again, the rumor and the innuendo, just as he has for the past 
month. It's not new. It is the sort of gossip that has followed Seagrave from 
job to job. 
</P>
<P>
Seagrave, as he goes over the events of that night in July a year ago, says he 
would not change a thing. He would not have hung up on the athlete or told her 
to talk to someone else. He would not have taken her to a restaurant or coffee 
shop instead of the house. He would not have refrained from comforting her, 
even kissing her. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing about counseling people is allowing them to be comfortable and 
allowing them to be spontaneous," Seagrave said. "If a person is feeling 
comfortable where they want to sit and talk, then that's the situation you want 
to be in. 
</P>
<P>
"See, no woman, or man for that matter, is going to break down and spill her 
guts in the middle of a restaurant. It's just not effective. And it takes a 
while. You don't just plop down and they say this or that. Sometimes it's a lot 
of sitting around talking and feeling comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
He says he can't understand the winks he has seen from people who are unwilling 
or unable to fathom that a non-sexual encounter is possible. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a soap-opera mentality," he said. "It ain't real life. It seems pretty 
narrow to me. Maybe the people who are deciding my fate, that's their problem. 
Maybe they have super hang-ups." 
</P>
<P>
In any event, the prevailing opinion is that Joe Dean and Henry, the men's 
track coach, did not approve of Seagrave or his relationship with his athletes. 
Or, for that matter, the manner in which some of the women on LSU's track team 
behaved. 
</P>
<P>
Henry, who does not smoke or drink and is by all accounts a devout person, is 
said to have been appalled by the rather freewheeling attitudes held by some 
college-age women. 
</P>
<P>
Add to that what has been described as Seagrave's "hands-on" approach to his 
team and what some see as a cavalier attitude regarding rules, and you get 
disapproval, at the very least. 
</P>
<P>
"Behind the whole thing, in my opinion, are the basic philosophical 
differences," said Alton Moran, Seagrave's attorney. "That's what is going on."

Seagrave, 38, began his coaching career at Madison East High School in Madison, 
Wis., then was hired as an assistant to Peter Tegen at the University of 
Wisconsin. From Tegen emerges a portrait of a bright, ambitious coach, one 
whose personal style was already emerging. 
</P>
<P>
"Loren was always a very concerned, very considerate and involved coach, that 
was apparent early," Tegen said. "There are those of us who are very distant. 
Loren was always involved with the athlete beyond the training session." 
</P>
<P>
Tegen remembers Seagrave as a ready learner who picked Tegen's brain regarding 
technique and coaching philosophy. He was a hard worker who was not dismayed by 
long hours, even by coaching standards. 
</P>
<P>
Tegen said, however, that Seagrave had one trait that disturbed him -- a 
tendency to take rules to their very limits. 
</P>
<P>
"That was one of the things that made me a little nervous," Tegen said. "Loren 
is willing to play out the rules to their fullest. I'm not saying that he broke 
any rules, really. He was just willing to play them to the fullest. That makes 
the person who is ultimately responsible very nervous." 
</P>
<P>
After Wisconsin, Seagrave took an assistant's job at Tennessee, for nine 
months. Terry Crawford, the 1988 Olympic women's track coach who was then the 
women's head coach at Tennessee and is now at Texas, remembers Seagrave as 
having been close to the athletes, almost too close. 
</P>
<P>
"His style is to be very personal, very hands-on with his athletes," Crawford 
said. "In terms of appearances, it has the tendency to turn on red lights and 
send up red flags. Because of the margin for rumor, there is probably a need 
for exaggerated professionalism and a need for caution. That's probably an area 
that Loren didn't consider the ramifications." 
</P>
<P>
Crawford acknowledges that she, too, has heard the rumors about Seagrave, 
especially in regard to recruiting violations. But the only incident she 
offered had to do with something that happened last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Loren encouraged an athlete of mine to come up for the summer and train," 
Crawford said. "He did that without consulting me or my staff. I found that to 
be highly unethical. You don't try to come between what we are doing with an 
athlete. I called his immediate supervisor, Pat Henry, and we took care of it. 
I think Loren showed poor judgment, at the very least." 
</P>
<P>
Seagrave is not unaware of the talk. But he states flat out that there have not 
been any recruiting violations. 
</P>
<P>
The Southeastern Conference would neither confirm nor deny reports from 
conference coaches that complaints have been filed against Seagrave. 
</P>
<P>
"There are legal boundaries you can't cross," Seagrave said. "But to say I 
haven't used all of the latitude within the boundaries of the rules would be 
wrong, because I have. You have to set up the situation so that it is legal. 
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that there were probably incidents with all of the people you 
talked to who had done the same thing, or were envious because they didn't 
think of it. I pride myself in gamesmanship. Knowing the rules and being able 
to play within the rules and being able to take advantage of situations is all 
part of gamesmanship." 
</P>
<P>
Regarding allegations that his athletes have tested positive for masking drugs, 
which hide the presence of steroids in the system -- but are not banned by the 
NCAA -- Seagrave responded angrily. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing people do when they are getting their butt kicked is try to 
find a defense mechanism to find why they can't do it," he said. "People were 
making the same allegations when I was at Tennessee. But no one's ever 
confronted me and asked me." 
</P>
<P>
But he has been confronted on another topic -- the graduation rate of his 
athletes. At least one national coach is concerned. Fred Thompson, coach of the 
Atoms Track Club in New York City and the sprint coach for the 1988 U.S. 
women's Olympic team, has this story to tell. 
</P>
<P>
He said he befriended Seagrave when the coach was still an assistant at 
Tennessee. Thompson introduced Seagrave to coaches and athletes in the New York 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt this guy was sincere about educating women," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I started looking at his program. Nobody ever graduated. What the hell 
was going on? I was sending him all kinds of kids and no one was getting a 
degree. Kids were coming in for one year, transferring, ineligible." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said that in 1976, he wrote to Benjamin Hooks of the NAACP, drawing 
his attention to the problems of black female athletes at LSU. Thompson said 
Seagrave confronted him about the letter. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him, 'You stabbed me in the back,' " Thompson said. "I used to help 
him. Now, I've gone the other route. I've warned coaches in this area not to 
send him kids. Everybody in this country knows how I feel about LSU. It's a 
standard joke in the coaching fraternity -- What school do kids not graduate 
from? LSU." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson is not alone in his concern. The Baton Rouge office of the NAACP 
threatened a boycott of black athletes at the school to protest what it 
considers discriminatory hiring practices at the school. G. Washington Eames, 
president of the Baton Rouge NAACP, said he is now looking into the athletic 
department, which he describes as having a notorious reputation. 
</P>
<P>
In a state that has a population that is more than 30% black, LSU's student 
population is 97% white. 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot tolerate my coaches spending all-night sessions with the opposite sex 
hugging and kissing. I just can't. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joe Dean, LSU athletic director 
</P>
<P>
Joe Dean is, of course, a central figure in the controversy. Yet he has been no 
less controversial for his handling of his own affairs as for the Seagrave 
case. Quite apart from his statements made after Seagrave's firing, Dean has 
exhibited an uncanny knack for letting his shoot-from-the-lip style undo him. 
</P>
<P>
Among his well-publicized gaffes was his opinion, written in the Feb. 15 
edition of Basketball Times, that a forum to discuss a two-year study on 
college athletics financed by the NCAA Presidents Commission was a total waste 
of time. "Never have I heard such a bunch of garbage," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Among the recommendations made at the last NCAA convention in the wake of the 
study were to eliminate spring football and reduce practice time for football 
and basketball, reduce the number of games in some sports and not allow any 
competition during exam periods. 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Dean: "A major problem with the NCAA is that too many academicians who've 
never been in the trenches are making decisions they aren't qualified to make." 
</P>
<P>
Then, on June 14, Dean made some remarks at a luncheon of alumni and 
legislators. In the June 15 editions of the Morning Advocate, a group of 
legislators expressed indignation over those remarks. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. John Travis told his House colleagues of the incident, quoting Dean as 
having said: "If the East Baton Rouge delegation doesn't get off their butts to 
support LSU, I will see that they get beat (for reelection.)" 
</P>
<P>
Dean said he couldn't understand the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was just giving them a pep talk," he said. "I was just trying to 
motivate them." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Dean sent a letter of apology to 22 legislators from the Parish 
of East Baton Rouge. 
</P>
<P>
"I obviously stuck my foot in my mouth," he said in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
There have been other embarrassments. On May 14, Mother's Day, Dean was 
involved in a hit-and-run accident in which, according to a police report, Dean 
struck another car from behind in an intersection then left the scene. 
</P>
<P>
Dean, driving a 1989 Oldsmobile that records show was leased to the state, 
drove away and stopped his car at a traffic light. When the driver of the car 
he had hit approached him, Dean said that he was too busy to stop, according to 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
The woman whose car had been hit then followed Dean onto the LSU campus where 
he parked at his office. She, along with two campus police officers, entered 
Dean's office where Dean admitted to having hit the woman's car. 
</P>
<P>
He later was cited for hit and run, failure to maintain control and not having 
a driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
All of which has led his critics to suggest that Dean was hardly in a position 
to take the moral high ground when it came to firing Seagrave for exercising 
bad judgment. 
</P>
<P>
By far the most damaging controversy surrounding Dean is the allegation of 
racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
One of the claims in Seagrave's suit is that Dean and others in the athletic 
department discriminated against Seagrave because they did not approve of his 
interracial marriage. Dean is alleged to have made derogatory statements about 
Seagrave and his "nigger wife." 
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that Seagrave was not considered for LSU's vacant men's head 
coaching job because of Dean's "discriminating values, views and beliefs." 
Moran admits that this will be difficult to prove, since many people are 
reluctant to testify. 
</P>
<P>
Dean has denied discrimination on his part. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Loren is, unfortunately, trying to make it look like a racial issue is 
involved because he is married to a black woman," Dean said. "But nothing could 
be further from the truth. I won't even give that credibility. It's ludicrous. 
We don't get into people's personal lives." 
</P>
<P>
Alton Moran is the director of the public defender's office for the Parish of 
East Baton Rogue. His office, beyond a courtyard in a charming New 
Orleans-style building downtown, is the usual cluttered affair. 
</P>
<P>
Moran does not take many private cases. Scores of Baton Rouge trial attorneys 
were eager to handle the sensational case, but Seagrave went straight to Moran, 
who had been the first president of the LSU Track and Field Officials Assn. 
</P>
<P>
His reading of this case has led to the $2-million lawsuit against Dean, Henry 
and the LSU Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The money breaks down as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Damages for humiliation, pain, suffering, and emotional distress and loss 
of reputation, $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Damages for loss of income, $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Punitive damages, $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the suit seeks to have Seagrave reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
Moran filed in federal court and did not request a jury trial. Because of this, 
unless the case is transferred to another district, it will be heard by one of 
two judges, either of whom may have a conflict. One judge is also employed by 
LSU. The other has a son who works at the law firm that is defending LSU. 
</P>
<P>
All attorneys involved estimate that even if the case is whisked through the 
system, it will be more than a year before it sees the inside of a courtroom. 
If it ever does. 
</P>
<P>
Moran says he took the case because it contained some interesting legal 
elements. 
</P>
<P>
One of his foremost questions concerns the procedure by which Seagrave was 
fired. Louisiana is an "employment at will" state, which means, in part, that 
an employer need not give a reason for firing an employee. This is part of the 
school's case, that Dean didn't have to give a reason for firing Seagrave. 
</P>
<P>
"We have certain rights as the employer and we have exercised them," said 
Shelby McKenzie, who represents LSU. 
</P>
<P>
Moran will argue that Page 5 of the LSU Employee Handbook requires that 
dismissals may only be for cause and must be in writing. 
</P>
<P>
He will put forth that LSU's grievance procedure was not properly followed in 
this case and that it is prejudicial. 
</P>
<P>
For example, he says, the last person to sign an LSU staff member's termination 
is the chancellor. By doing this, he says, the chancellor is agreeing that the 
employee should be fired. However, in the grievance process, the final arbiter 
is also the chancellor -- who has already rendered a judgment. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think it's fair? I don't think it's fair," Moran said. "I think anyone 
who is employed somewhere for six years, and puts so much of himself into his 
work, should at least know why he is being terminated. Or at least have an 
impartial hearing." 
</P>
<P>
It may not seem like much to ask, but consider that the state's own governor 
admits he's still trying to bring Louisiana "tip-toeing into the 20th Century." 
</P>
<P>
Consider also that Louisiana is the only state that adheres to the Napoleonic 
Code of civil law, rather then English common of law. One way this manifests 
itself is that the courts are limited in the application of the law to the 
given facts and may not be bound by legal precedents. 
</P>
<P>
Consider finally that Moran is basing his case almost entirely on Seagrave's 
version of events. He even allowed Seagrave to retrieve his own personnel 
records from the school and pass on only what he thinks is important. 
</P>
<P>
So, when Moran is asked if Seagrave's file contains any previous reprimands or 
reports of any ethical or professional misconduct, he says no, there have been 
no problems. But he has not personally seen the file. Only Seagrave has. 
</P>
<P>
And the school is not telling us what it contains. Yet. 
</P>
<P>
The answering machine at the Seagrave-Freeman apartment this week offers this 
musical advice: "Don't worry, be happy." 
</P>
<P>
It is a pleasant thought. However, there is not much evidence that anyone here 
may be able to live by the sentiment. LSU officials have threatened to arrest 
Seagrave if he shows up at the track. He has received death threats from people 
who have written to express their opinion of his mixed marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Seagrave is out of a job and looking at more than a year before he has a shot 
at clearing his name. Even if he wins in court, the likelihood that another 
college will hire him is dim. 
</P>
<P>
"He's killed his reputation," said one coach. "The innuendo is terrible. There 
are some stories out there about him that are horrendous." 
</P>
<P>
Seagrave's wife, Kathy Freeman, is taking a 90-day leave of absence from her 
job as a Baton Rouge police officer. She's angry and hurt and a lot else. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate how they are treating him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman, 27, grew up in Baton Rouge and said she has known prejudice. She says 
she won't give in to it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think, through it all, they wanted Loren and myself to break up," said 
Freeman, a former hurdler at Southern University in Baton Rouge. "They think 
they'll hurt him and in the process his wife will divorce him. They just don't 
know. It's only making our relationship stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for both sides are adamant that they will see this case through to 
court. But . . . 
</P>
<P>
Whose interest would it serve to train the court's bright lights on the dark 
corners of this case? 
</P>
<P>
Will LSU remain untainted by showing Seagrave to be of questionable ethical 
fiber? 
</P>
<P>
Does the athletic department really want any more close scrutiny? 
</P>
<P>
Can Seagrave afford to run the risk of taking the case to court, only to be 
ambushed by some past indiscretion that may come out? 
</P>
<P>
Isn't this the kind of of lawsuit that rubs something ugly off onto everyone it 
touches? 
</P>
<P>
Might the judge's decision not be the kind that finds everyone guilty? 
</P>
<P>
The women's track progam at LSU has certainly found success. The question now 
is, can it live with it? 
</P>

FINLEY STRIKES OUT 15 AND WINS; 
</P>
<P>
ANGEL LEFT-HANDER USES FORKBALL TO BEAT ORIOLES, 8-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last time an Angel left-handed pitcher was this overpowering, his name was 
Frank Tanana, back in the days when Tanana's fastball could still stun a radar 
gun and give Nolan Ryan's a run for its voltage. 
</P>
<P>
That was 13 years ago, a memory that has faded with the pace of Tanana's 
pitches. But for those among the 45,824 at Anaheim Stadium Saturday night who 
know Tanana only as the graying Tiger with the junkball deliveries, young Chuck 
Finley boldly demonstrated how it was once done. 
</P>
<P>
By striking out 15 Baltimore Orioles in an 8-3 Angel victory, Finley became the 
first Angel left-hander to reach such a potent level since Tanana fanned 15 
Oakland A's on Sept. 6, 1976. It was also the highest strikeout total by an 
Angel pitcher since right-hander Mike Witt recorded 16 on July 23, 1984, 
against the Seattle Mariners -- and the highest total in the major leagues this 
season, matching the 15 strikeouts that Ryan logged against the Milwaukee 
Brewers on April 12. 
</P>
<P>
For a while, Finley threatened to break even more impressive ground. He had 10 
strikeouts after five innings and 14 after eight. The Angel record for most 
strikeouts by a left-hander is 17, set by Tanana in 1975. The American League 
record for most strikeouts by a left-hander is 18, set by the New York Yankees' 
Ron Guidry against the Angels in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
How did Finley, who had never struck out more than 10 men in a game, put 
himself in such a position? 
</P>
<P>
With a forkball, the Orioles kept saying. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd never seen him throw it before," said Baltimore left fielder Phil Bradley, 
who struck out twice in four at-bats. "I usually guard against it with two 
strikes. I was looking for it and still couldn't hit it. It was just 
outstanding, biting right in the dirt." 
</P>
<P>
Echoed Baltimore Manager Frank Robinson: "I wasn't close enough to see, (but) 
all I know is whenever he had two strikes, he'd throw his forkball or 
split-finger or whatever he calls it and then bounce the next one, and we'd 
swing at it." 
</P>
<P>
A dissenting, and minority, opinion was offered by Oriole catcher Bob Melvin. 
But then, Melvin had a reason. He struck out four times. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it was," he said. "I haven't seen it." 
</P>
<P>
The forkball is, of course, the pitch Finley added to his repertoire during the 
waning weeks of the 1988 season. It is the pitch that has transformed him from 
a 9-15 plodder last season to the type of pitcher who throws a one-hitter in 
Boston and strikes out 15 Orioles in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
For Finley (8-6), it was a splashy way to end his four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
And the Angels, who had scored only seven runs for Finley in his previous five 
starts, celebrated the occasion with 15 hits and eight runs, including four 
home runs -- one apiece by Johnny Ray, Brian Downing, Devon White and Jack 
Howell. 
</P>
<P>
In Angel Manager Doug Rader's estimation, those home runs were almost as 
important to Finley's performance as his new-found bonus pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"No question that a few early runs help ease the pain," Rader said. "It makes 
it a whole lot easier to pitch that way." 
</P>
<P>
Finley admitted that the burden of a four-game losing streak had been a heavy 
weight to carry to the mound. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I'd been putting too much self-inflicted pressure on myself," said 
Finley with a redundancy that matched his strikeout ratio on this evening. "I 
was trying to do too much instead of just taking my natural stuff out there." 
</P>
<P>
Once the Angel home run assault put the game out of reach, the real suspense 
began to set in: 
</P>
<P>
Just how high could Finley's strikeout total climb? 
</P>
<P>
Finley struck out the side in the fifth inning and had 12 strikeouts with one 
out in the seventh. But he was temporarily stalled there when Mike Devereaux 
and Cal Ripken grounded out to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
But Finley came back with strikeouts of Randy Milligan and Melvin in the eighth 
to send him into the last inning with a total of 14. 
</P>
<P>
Strike out the side . . . and Finley ties Tanana's left-handed Angel record of 
17. 
</P>
<P>
Finley made it interesting, too, as he retired Baltimore's leadoff hitter in 
the ninth inning, Craig Worthington, on strikes. Then, center fielder Steve 
Finley singled. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Ripken, who had fanned in his previous at-bat, stepped in, taking a .239 
batting average with him. Ripken, Baltimore's No. 9 hitter in the lineup, 
seemed easy prey. 
</P>
<P>
But Ripken put the head of the bat on the ball and bounced a grounder to Howell 
at third base. Howell fired to second base for one out, and Ray turned the 
pivot and threw to first to complete the double play. 
</P>
<P>
If ever a game-ending double play could be considered a partial disappointment 
for the winning side, this was it. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know how many (strikeouts) I had until they flashed 'em up on the 
scoreboard," Finley said. "I wish they hadn't done that. I didn't want to get 
to the point where I was trying to strike people out. I just wanted to finish 
the game." 
</P>
<P>
That Finley did. Finley wound up with a seven-hitter and his sixth complete 
game of the season, which is the most on the Angel staff and the third-best 
total in the American League, behind the Kansas City Royals' Bret Saberhagen 
and Mark Gubicza, who have seven apiece. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Finley finished the regular season with two complete games. 
</P>
<P>
But that was long before the forkball. As 15 Orioles learned Saturday night, 
that pitch has changed things a bit. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
With three at-bats Saturday night, Brian Downing surpassed Jim Fregosi as the 
club's leader in career at-bats with 5,245. Of the 12 major offensive 
categories the club lists, Downing ranks as the Angels' career leader in all 
but three. He also leads the franchise in games played (1,491), hits (1,422), 
runs (817), home runs (201), RBIs (763), doubles (253), extra-base hits (474) 
and total bases (2,318). For the time being, that figures to be it for Downing, 
who is not going to catch Rod Carew in batting average (.314 to Downing's .271) 
or Fregosi in triples (70 to Downing's 20) or Gary Pettis in stolen bases (186 
to Downing's 27). 
</P>
<P>
Add Records: Credit the Angels' publicity staff for digging up this one. 
Sandwiched around two lengthy stints on the disabled list, Tony Armas has hit 
in six consecutive games. The streak dates back to April 8, a span of 78 days, 
which is longer than it took Joe DiMaggio to record his 56-game hitting streak. 
Of course, Armas has appeared in just seven games this season. His hits have 
come on the dates of April 8-9, May 15, June 20-21 and 23. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Schroeder started his second consecutive game as the catcher Saturday, 
with Angel Manager Doug Rader wanting to give Lance Parrish's sore back an 
extra day's rest. Parrish took batting practice and could be ready to play in 
today's series finale, according to Rader. . . . Dave Schmidt's complete game 
Friday night was the Orioles' first since April 24 and only the club's fourth 
of the season. Schmidt also threw the April 24th complete game, also at Anaheim 
Stadium. The date is notable for one other reason: On that night, Jim Abbott 
beat Schmidt, 3-2, for his first major league victory.

DODGER HITTERS ARE RED-HOT IN 10-3 VICTORY 
</P>

CINCINNATI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It may have been the 89-degree heat, it may have been the smothering humidity, 
or, knowing those Dodgers, it may have just been the national television. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, there were several unusual sightings Saturday as the Dodgers beat the 
Cincinnati Reds, 10-3, a score that would probably qualify as the most unusual 
sighting of all. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- When is the last time you have seen 17 Dodger hits, including an infield 
double by Alfredo Griffin and a pinch home run by Franklin Stubbs? Against a 
struggling collection of Red pitchers -- Tim Birtsas, Mike Griffin, Kent 
Tekulve -- the Dodgers had their best offensive day of the season before 37,211 
at Riverfront Stadium fans. This impressed nearly everybody. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, you could have gotten a hit today," Red Manager Pete Rose barked at one 
reporter. "We just didn't pitch good." 
</P>
<P>
Added a downcast Tekulve, who has allowed 11 runs in his last seven 
appearances: "I always do what's best for the ballclub, and right now, pitching 
once a week and taking a beating is best for the ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
 -- When is the last time you have seen Fernando Valenzuela sprinting around 
the bases, running nearly as fast as his fastball? In winning his fourth 
consecutive start after going winless for nearly a year, Valenzuela also went 2 
for 2, with a double and a single, and scored two runs. After Valenzuela scored 
his second run, just beating a throw from center fielder Rolando Roomes, team 
trainer Bill Buhler spent 10 minutes fanning the pitcher with a towel. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that must have given him 40, 50 extra pitches," Dodger Manager Tom 
Lasorda said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, who is 4-5 with a 4.15 earned-run average, sweated through six 
innings, giving up three runs on nine hits and topping it off with a 
prediction. 
</P>
<P>
"I think maybe we (the old Dodgers) are back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When is the last time you have seen Valenzuela relieved by Tim Belcher? 
Dodger management finally showed a bit of what they intend to do with their 
pitching logjam when starter Belcher was sent out in the seventh inning to 
relieve for the first time since last July 5. 
</P>
<P>
At about the same time Saturday, the Dodgers announced that John Tudor, who 
hasn't pitched since last year's World Series, would come off the disabled list 
and start Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium against the San Diego Padres. They 
did not announce which pitcher would be shipped out to make room for Tudor, but 
one of the leading candidates is right-hander Tim Crews. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's more players than just me who wish they would say something," 
said Crews, who has no decisions and one save in 33 innings. "We're like fish 
in the water . . . one of us is going to get hooked." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both Tudor and Belcher appear equally cautious. 
</P>
<P>
Said Tudor of his rehabilitation from extensive shoulder and elbow surgery: 
"It's not done yet; it won't be over until I get back out there; there's 
nothing I can say yet." 
</P>
<P>
Said Belcher: "Everybody has been smelling something coming, but I'm not so 
sure it's here yet. All I was told was I'm going to miss a start and pitch down 
in the bullpen while I'm doing it. I wasn't told it was about my performance." 
</P>
<P>
However, Belcher, one of last season's top rookies, hasn't won a game since May 
25, a span covering five starts during which he has a 4.17 ERA. Overall, he is 
4-6 with a 3.13 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be good for him," pitching coach Ron Perranoski said. "This will 
help him approach the hitters better." 
</P>
<P>
Belcher shrugged. "I prefer to start, but I don't despise the bullpen," he 
said. "It's like an auto mechanic. If you can work on both foreign cars and 
American cars, you can get a helluva lot more business. I guess this will give 
me good versatility." 
</P>
<P>
It has already given him a save. He allowed the Reds just two hits over the 
last three innings Saturday to tidy up a game that began for the Dodgers as a 
mess. 
</P>
<P>
Birtsas, making his first start of the season while filling in for Danny 
Jackson, who is out with a shoulder injury, struck out four of the first five 
Dodgers he faced. Meanwhile, the Reds scored two first-inning runs on a two-run 
double by Joel Youngblood that bounced over the head of Mariano Duncan, making 
a rare start in right field. 
</P>
<P>
But then Birtsas lost it, retiring only two more Dodgers before being relieved 
in the third. "Birtsas was hitting the spots for a little while," Lasorda said. 
"And then he just stopped." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers scored four runs off Birtsas in the second inning, including a 
two-run double by Griffin on a grounder that bounced off second baseman Lenny 
Harris' shin and rolled into shallow left field, and RBI singles by Valenzuela 
and Duncan. They scored twice more in the fourth on a run-scoring fly ball by 
Willie Randolph and an RBI single by Kirk Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
Griffin went 3 for 5 with two doubles to increase his hitting streak to nine 
games, in which he is hitting .457. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the way a little guy like me has to hit," Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
Those four runs were all the Dodgers needed once Valenzuela found his fastball, 
which, while nothing blazing, is still hard enough to make his other pitches 
work. After his first-inning troubles, he retired 15 of his next 22 batters and 
left the game in the sixth inning with a 6-3 lead and a sense of perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks easy when any pitcher gets runs like I had today," he said, not 
needing to note that he has actually pitched better this year in losses than in 
his wins -- he has a 4.00 ERA in his four victories. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Mariano Duncan was removed from Saturday's game in the fifth inning with a 
strained left hamstring. He started in right field, with Jose Gonzalez being 
switched to center field and struggling John Shelby being benched. At the time 
of his injury, Duncan had singled twice and scored twice and could be back in 
the lineup as soon as he is able. "Just a couple of days," said Duncan, who is 
hitting .280. "This won't keep me out." . . . Even with the return of John 
Tudor, the Dodgers still have a pitcher on the disabled list who is not 
disabled, Ray Searage. He threw here Friday and said that his back spasms have 
subsided and he is ready to come off the disabled list. "Because his problem 
was in his back, we are never without concern," said Fred Claire, Dodger 
executive vice president. "We're going to be careful with him, and get him in 
there as soon as we're sure he's ready." . . . Saturday, Claire promised once 
again that he was doing his best to improve the club's league-worst offense. 
"There are no more than two or three clubs that I haven't talked to in the last 
three or four days," he said. "Some people think teams are constantly asking 
for our pitching. Well, they're not. I make 10 calls for every one call I 
receive. I'm doing my best, and this club will be improved." Claire noted that 
in the wake of recent criticism over his failure to trade for outfielder Rickey 
Henderson, dealt to Oakland by the New York Yankees, one aspect of the 
Henderson deal was unknown. "Because I value my trust with (Yankee Vice 
President) Syd Thrift, I didn't want to tell anybody, but he told me Henderson 
would refuse a trade to the National League," Claire said. "So we never had a 
chance."

WARRIORS SIGN MARCHULENIS, FIRST NBA SOVIET

Sharunas Marchulenis, the leading scorer for the Soviet Union's 1988 Olympic 
gold medal-winning team, became the first player from his country to join the 
National Basketball Assn. by signing a three-year contract with the Golden 
State Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
The Warriors, in announcing the signing of the 6-foot-5 guard from Lithuania 
Saturday, declined to disclose contract terms. 
</P>
<P>
"He is the world's premier basketball player outside the United States, both in 
my opinion and in the eyes of many basketball authorities," said Don Nelson, 
Warrior coach and general manager. "It is indeed an incredible day for us." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said Marchulenis is so good that he would have been a lottery pick in 
the college draft the past two years. "He's a ready-made package," Nelson said. 
"By taking his skill and putting him on a basketball court, he's ready to 
roll." 
</P>
<P>
Marchulenis, 25, is playing for the Soviet national team in the European 
Championships at Zagreb, Yugoslavia. He is expected to visit the Bay Area 
within a month. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Volkov, another member of the Soviet team, also received permission 
to sign with the NBA, but a controversy is brewing over his rights. The league 
says he can sign only with the Atlanta Hawks, who drafted him in 1986, while 
Volkov and his American agent, Marc Fleisher, say he is free to sign with any 
team. Fleisher also is Marchulenis' agent. 
</P>
<P>
Arvydas Sabonis, said to be the best Soviet player before suffering an 
Achilles' tendon injury, is passing up a chance with the Portland Trail Blazers 
to play in Spain for a year. 
</P>
<P>
Marchulenis averaged 18.1 points in eight games during the Seoul Olympics, 
including a 19-point effort in an 82-76 victory over the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I am extremely pleased to be playing with the Warriors," Marchulenis said in a 
statement read at a news conference. "Don Nelson is the best coach, and Chris 
Mullin and Mitch Richmond are two of the best players in the NBA. Golden State 
was one of the most-improved teams in NBA history last year. This season we 
will be even more successful." 
</P>
<P>
Richmond, last season's rookie of the year, played on the U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said the Warriors have been watching the Soviet player for 2 1/2 years 
and had been negotiating with him for several months. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly where Marchulenis will fit in with the Warriors' plans, and whether he 
will start, will be answered at training camp, Nelson said. A factor that 
helped complete the deal was the ruling last spring by the international body 
governing basketball that NBA players will be allowed to compete in 
international competition. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of the ruling in Europe has been that basketball authorities 
interpret it to mean they may bring their national players back for Olympic 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Vilnius, Lithuania, Marchulenis and his wife Inga have a young 
daughter. Marchulenis is able to speak and understand some English but will 
take additional language lessons, Nelson said.

EDBERG'S GAME ISN'T TYPICAL OF SWEDES, BUT HIS RESULTS ARE

<TEXT>
<P>
Seventeen years ago in Vastervik, Sweden, the parents of a 6-year-old boy who 
liked ice hockey and soccer saw a newspaper advertisement about a tennis 
facility. They decided they would like their son to try tennis and he agreed. 
</P>
<P>
The youngster went once a week for a year, but he wasn't always thrilled with 
the sport and thought about quitting more than once. His mom and dad urged him 
to stick with it, though, and eventually he started to enjoy tennis. 
</P>
<P>
He began to hit tennis balls against a wall near his home for hours when he was 
away from the court, and he took tennis balls to bed with him. 
</P>
<P>
Not yet 8 years old, he became a regular at the small tennis club that had two 
clay courts and one indoor court, but no clubhouse. They let him play free. He 
competed in a lot of summer tournaments. Since the boy was the youngest at the 
club, he always played against older players and that accelerated his progress. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he was 11, he was unseeded in his first big junior tournament, but 
he won. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody knew who I was," said Stefan Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
Those times seem to be a comfortable memory when Edberg summons them to the 
conversation these days. At 23, he is ranked No. 3 in the world and the 
defending champion of the most famous tennis tournament in the world -- 
Wimbledon. But when he was banging those tennis balls off that wall in 
Vastervik, Edberg didn't once wonder if he would win at Wimbledon, or even what 
his future might be in his chosen career. 
</P>
<P>
"You never thought about that when you were young," Edberg said. "When I got up 
to 15, 16, then you start to think about becoming professional. Mats Wilander 
won the French when he was 17. Then you realized you weren't that far behind 
him so you thought 'Maybe I've got a chance, too.' " 
</P>
<P>
His biggest chance arose last July. At the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet 
Club, he mowed down Boris Becker in a rain-delayed final for the one Grand Slam 
title that means more than any other. 
</P>
<P>
"Every tennis player that's ever picked up a racket has always wanted to win 
Wimbledon," said Tony Picard, Edberg's coach. 
</P>
<P>
It was a victory that probably made Edberg's career. Two Australian Open titles 
notwithstanding, winning Wimbledon is a lifetime achievement for any player, 
but it is also not without its risks. Pat Cash of Australia won two years ago, 
only to fall victim to poor health and a sinking career. Becker won twice the 
two years before that and has been continually tormented by the specter of 
failing to win a third. 
</P>
<P>
For Edberg, victory seems to have meant something different. 
</P>
<P>
"I never really dreamt about being a big star," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His father is still a policeman in Vastervik and his mother still works with 
the disabled. Although Edberg moved from his hometown to London, he said his 
personality is where it has always been. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no need for me to change," he said. "There is no point painting up a 
different personality. I am the person I am. I am comfortable with that. You 
could behave like a big star and you really could make people walk in that 
direction for you. Really paint a different picture. I don't believe that's any 
good for me." 
</P>
<P>
Neither has the personality of Edberg's game changed, one that is altogether 
different from the normal Swedish tradition of hitting from the baseline. From 
Bjorn Borg to Mats Wilander to Kent Carlsson, the baseline has always been 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg, however, felt different. Legendary Swedish Coach Percy Rosberg decided 
that Edberg had the natural ability to serve and volley, so he moved Edberg 
from the baseline to the net. Picard, who refined Edberg's game, said it didn't 
take a genius to see that a change in tactics was warranted. 
</P>
<P>
"He's fortunate to have a big serve, but we've also improved his movements on 
the court tremendously, made him so much quicker," Picard said. "And with that 
kind of game that he was able to play, it was nonsense to play the back of the 
court. Yeah, he's un-Swedish if you like." 
</P>
<P>
After winning Wimbledon last year, Edberg's results began to fall off, but he 
began the year with a good start in Australia, athough he had to default to 
Thomas Muster of Austria in the quarterfinals because of a back injury. Two 
weeks ago, Edberg got to the final of the French Open, but lost to Michael 
Chang of Placentia in five sets. 
</P>
<P>
But in Wilander's opinion, Edberg could win Wimbledon again this year because 
of his new-found mental superiority. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened to him, I think, is the same that happened to me," Wilander 
said. "For me, to become the world No. 1., it was great, but it was also a 
relief. I think for him to win Wimbledon, which is where he was aiming, I think 
he's kind of relieved he has done it. 
</P>
<P>
"He's proved to himself that he could win the biggest tournament in the world 
and I think he's proved to a lot of people who were doubting that he had the 
ability and the mental capacity to win a tournament like that. 
</P>
<P>
"So I think he was kind of relieved that he won and I think that's kind of the 
reason he didn't play well after that. Now he's picking up his motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"Wimbledon, it's such a big thing for everybody that hasn't won it," Wilander 
said. "That's the way I feel. When you haven't won it, you pass that edge of 
thinking you can't win it because it's Wimbledon. I think that's what I'm 
thinking a little bit. That's what you know about tennis. Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
"For him, now, he's done it. I think now he realizes that winning that 
tournament is not as big a thing as everybody thinks it is. It's huge, but it's 
not impossible. In a way, in his mind, I think it's maybe the easiest 
tournament to win because he has that mental edge." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg remembers watching television as Borg won Wimbledon five consecutive 
years, from 1976-1980. Eight years later, Edberg won. Wilander, who won his 
first Grand Slam title at 17, won three more last year and became the first 
Swede to be ranked No. 1 since Borg. 
</P>
<P>
But if there is one tournament that Edberg would like to win more than any 
other, it would be Wimbledon, again. 
</P>
<P>
"That is my No. 1 choice," Edberg said. "The whole environment. The whole 
tradition. And I like playing on grass as well. I was brought up watching Borg 
playing all those Wimbledon finals. And that's the one like the most -- and 
want the most." 
</P>
<P>
Wilander said if there are any doubters about Edberg's stature, all Edberg has 
to do is . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Win Wimbledon or the U. S. Open, which is where I think he has his best 
chance, then he has definitely proved his point," Wilander said. "He's still at 
the beginning of his career. He knows, or at least I know, he's going to win 
Wimbledon at least two or three more times because of the way he plays. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope he's not worried. I think if he wins it again, then he doesn't have to 
worry about anybody anymore. He can just worry about himself."

MIKE DOWNEY: ROSE HAS EVERYBODY WONDERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mike Downey 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Know which image I cannot purge from my mind? Pete Rose bumping that ump. When 
it happened, I considered it nothing more than an isolated, spontaneous, 
interesting yet not particularly world-shaking outbreak of violence, sort of 
like Zsa Zsa Gabor slapping that Beverly Hills cop. But now . . . 
</P>
<P>
Remember the night Rose thumped that umpire, Dave Pallone? Come on. Sure you 
do. Pallone made a call at first base, with which Rose vehemently disagreed. 
The Cincinnati manager came bounding out of the dugout, did his best Billy 
Martin imitation right in Pallone's face, then gave the guy a forecheck with 
both folded arms. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, all I thought was that Rose ought to feel ashamed of himself. He 
objected to the length of his suspension, but, truth is, ballplayers and their 
bosses are always attempting to feed us that malarkey about how they want to be 
a good influence on children, then they abuse umpires and fling helmets and 
incite brawls and attribute it all to being intense. 
</P>
<P>
It is human to feel anger, sure. The thing about Rose's ump-bump, though, was 
that if a man is so out of control that he cannot resist striking an umpire, 
then why is he so much under control that he strikes him with his arms? Why 
didn't Pete Rose haul off and belt Dave Pallone in the chops? Because Rose knew 
exactly what he was doing, that's why. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose knows what he can do and what he cannot do, particularly in the 
dominion of baseball. With regard to betting on baseball games -- or, even 
worse, on your own team -- only an imbecile would do such a thing and truly 
believe he could never be caught. As Jim Palmer pointed out on national 
television, no clubhouse in baseball has failed to prominently post a printed 
warning pertaining to the penalties for wagering on the game. 
</P>
<P>
That is the trouble with this ongoing scandal as to whether or not the great 
Charlie Hustle had any sort of off-field hustle going. With even his pretrial 
hearings being aired live, coast to coast, Rose is fast becoming an Ollie North 
in short pants. 
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons I wish Pete Rose had never gotten himself into this fix, 
among them the aforementioned run-in with that umpire. Why was Rose so vicious, 
so tactless, so volcanic as to make bodily contact with an umpire? Who 
understood the laws of baseball better than Pete? Why did this one call set him 
off the way it did? It wasn't a World Series, wasn't a September stretch drive. 
Could it be -- dare we think it -- that Rose had other motives for wanting so 
badly to win that one game? 
</P>
<P>
See, that's the trouble with all this. It sets our minds racing. We can barely 
look at a guy anymore without wondering. It's like Wade Boggs, who probably 
cannot over-tip a waitress nowadays without her wondering whether he is coming 
on to her. We watch Pete Rose with new eyes. We go back to box scores of 
certain games in question and wonder about every pitching change, every 
pinch-hitter sent up, every managerial move. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent informal poll of some of the people who vote on players eligible 
for the Hall of Fame, the result seemed to be Rose was in no danger of being 
left out, come 1992, his first year on the ballot, even if he is suspended or 
even banned from baseball after this gambling mess is settled. The consensus 
seemed to be Rose's achievements on the field outweighed everything, as long as 
he never bet against the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
There is another movement afoot, meantime, to posthumously induct poor old 
Shoeless Joe Jackson, one of the "Eight Men Out" who was accused of tanking the 
1919 World Series. Jackson and seven other Chicago White Sox were acquitted in 
a court of law, but the commissioner of baseball banned them from the game for 
life, regardless, because it was in his power to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Rose has been attempting, through his attorneys, to avoid having history 
repeat. He does not want the commissioner to determine his fate. He wants a 
judge or jury to do so. There are those who support both sides of this issue, 
and, surprisingly, one of Rose's nearest and dearest former teammates, Joe 
Morgan, went public Thursday with the opinion that Pete should be judged solely 
by the commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
As the evidence stacks up against him, Pete Rose is up to his hips in deep dip, 
sliding headfirst. We nearly stood and cheered the other day when he finally 
stated aloud that he never bet on baseball in his life, because why would he 
compound his mistake by lying when he simply could have continued waiting for a 
verdict to be passed down? Well, perhaps Pete could no longer resist saying 
what we so much wanted to hear him say. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Johnson scored points, in a peculiar sort of way, by 'fessing up to his 
misdeeds. Honesty still seems to be the best policy, even when one is being 
honest about one's dishonesty. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow I have faith that the general public will stay by Pete Rose's side, 
even if he serves a year's suspension for betting on baseball, because gambling 
has become more disease than sin. Even if Gamblin' Rose did bet on the Reds, as 
long as the bet was on them to win, many Americans would be forgiving. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, if Pete Rose did bet on the Reds, to win or lose, he is going to 
be the ninth man out. I can hardly bear to look. He is going. He is going. He 
is almost gone.

LANDING HENDERSON, A'S GOT BETTER; SO DID GIANTS, METS

<P>
There was heavy trading on the New York and Pacific stock exchanges this week. 
</P>
<P>
In action generally associated with Labor Day and the September stretch drive, 
the Bay Area and New York teams plunged early in an attempt -- for the most 
part -- to enhance their chances for title dividends. 
</P>
<P>
Here are a synopsis and analysis: 
</P>
<P>
RICKEY GOES HOME 
</P>
<P>
Already boasting baseball's best record, despite a barrage of injuries, the 
Oakland Athletes couldn't restrain their enthusiasm at re-acquiring leadoff man 
and left fielder Rickey Henderson from the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a run whenever he gets on base," pitcher Dave Stewart said. "It's 
automatic offense. You'll see the difference immediately." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dave Parker, the designated hitter: "In New York, Rickey was the whole 
show. He felt he had to do it all. Here, he just has to do his job. Now he'll 
put on the show." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody can do it better than Henderson, when he has his mind on it. 
</P>
<P>
But the Yankees -- at least at the management level -- had begun to question 
the frequency with which he had his mind on it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not saying Rickey didn't bust his tail every day, but I just didn't see 
the juice and enthusiasm people said Rickey had when he's on a hot streak," 
Manager Dallas Green said. 
</P>
<P>
If ever there was a season for Henderson to display that juice, this was it. 
</P>
<P>
He is coming off a five-year, $8.6-million contract, is eligible for free 
agency when the season ends, reportedly wants $8.2 million over three years and 
had given the Yankees until the All-Star break to reach an agreement, at which 
point, he said, negotiations would end and he would plan on playing elsewhere 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson and the Yankees were said to be $1.2 million apart, a difference the 
club was unwilling to resolve, considering that Henderson will be 31 on 
Christmas Day and there are questions about the consistency of his physical 
skills -- in addition to those concerning his drive. A trade also represented 
an opportunity for the Yankees to improve their bullpen depth. 
</P>
<P>
They acquired relief pitchers Eric Plunk and Greg Cadaret and left fielder Luis 
Polonia, who replaces Henderson -- at least on the lineup card. Polonia is a 
spray hitter with speed, but he lacks Henderson's defensive ability and his 
on-base percentage doesn't compare because of an unwillingness to accept walks. 
</P>
<P>
Former Yankee manager Lou Piniella reflected on the acquisitions and said: 
"It's almost like the Yankees borrowed Rickey for four years and then sent him 
back for the same ingredients." 
</P>
<P>
In acquiring Henderson from the A's 4 1/2 years ago, they traded spray hitting 
outfielder Stan Javier and pitchers Jose Rijo, Tim Birtsas and Jay Howell. 
</P>
<P>
Before and since, the Yankees have traded so much pitching talent that Plunk 
and Cadaret -- primarily middle men who at times played key rolls for the A's 
but weren't considered irreplaceable -- probably glittered like gold. 
</P>
<P>
Most Yankees, however, endorsed the view of relief pitcher Dave Righetti, who 
reflected on the loss of Henderson and said: 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't thrilled. It's the last thing I expected to see. I'm trying to figure 
out what direction we're going in. We've had trouble scoring runs and we're 
going to miss him. 
</P>
<P>
"When he got here in '83 we became a damn good team right away. He had that 
try-to-get-me-out arrogance. Our whole lineup was like that last year. I hope 
he doesn't come back and beat us but you know he will someday." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, who averaged .293 in his previous four years with the Yankees, was 
hitting .247 when traded. His success rate on steal attempts was down from 86% 
to 75.8%, and his pace projected to only 55 steals, 90 runs and 48 runs batted 
in. 
</P>
<P>
The A's, however, are confident that Henderson will be invigorated by the 
return to his hometown and the chance to ignite one of baseball's most 
formidable lineups once Jose Canseco returns near the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
They are confident, too, that their prized chemistry won't be disrupted by an 
often individualistic player. When the trade was being rumored, Oakland players 
huddled privately, then let management know they approved the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
"If he tries anything that's not in the spirit of what we're trying to 
accomplish here, he's going to hear about it," Manager Tony LaRussa said. "He's 
going to hear about it from the manager, the coaches and a bunch of players." 
</P>
<P>
There are two bottom lines for the A's. They are optimistic they can sign 
Henderson. And, as Canseco said, "To me, he's got to be the best leadoff hitter 
ever. How often do you get a chance to trade for that kind of player?" 
</P>
<P>
RELIEF FOR THE GIANTS 
</P>
<P>
In their championship summer of 1987, sensing a chance to put the National 
League's Western Division away, the San Francisco Giants traded for pitchers 
Rick Reuschel, Dave Dravecky, Craig Lefferts and Don Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the same sense that club President Al Rosen moved to acquire relief 
ace Steve Bedrosian from the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't felt an adrenaline rush like this since the '87 playoffs," second 
baseman Rob Thompson said after the Giants acquired a pitcher who had saved 97 
games over the previous three years but had become a luxury for the Phillies 
since they could seldom get to him with a lead because of their pathetic 
starting pitching. 
</P>
<P>
In the Phillies' first 61 games, Bedrosian had eight save opportunities. He had 
two in his first three games with the Giants and converted both. 
</P>
<P>
The San Francisco bullpen had walked in the winning run six times and 
wild-pitched it in once before his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Giants have the best of both worlds: A proven right-hander in his prime 
-- Bedrosian is 31 -- and a dependable left-hander, Lefferts, who is 13 for 13 
in saves. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants had to part with a pair of promising young left-handers, Dennis Cook 
and Terry Mulholland, but their farm system is considered to be loaded with 
lefties. 
</P>
<P>
As Manager Roger Craig said Thursday after his team had come off a 10-2 home 
stand that included the two saves by Bedrosian: 
</P>
<P>
"If I was on the other side, I'd be saying, 'That club is hot. It's on a roll, 
and now its got Steve Bedrosian. It's going to be tough to catch.' " 
</P>
<P>
NO MORE MOOK-STRA 
</P>
<P>
The Mets have put an end to a center field platoon that displeased both Mookie 
Wilson and Lenny Dykstra, since Dykstra now is happily playing full-time for 
the Phillies. Wilson remains with the Mets, but his situation has deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
In dealing Dykstra, the Mets acquired Juan Samuel, who will lead off and play 
center regularly. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's batting average has hovered near .200 all season. Dykstra is as gritty 
as ever, but in the last three seasons his batting average had slipped from 
.295 to .285 to .270, and his on-base percentage had gone from .377 to .352 to 
.321. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel, 28, has struck out 140 or more times in each of his five big league 
seasons, but he has also averaged 18 homers, 34 doubles, 14 triples and 47 
stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets have been searching for an impact player, and Samuel has that 
potential. He also gives 100% on every play, an important consideration for the 
Mets, who were dismayed when Dykstra failed recently to run out a shallow fly 
ball that fell untouched. 
</P>
<P>
Of Samuel, Manager Dave Johnson said: "I told him I felt he could provide a 
little professionalism. I felt we had been lacking in certain areas. He's a guy 
that plays by the old rules, who doesn't take it for granted that they're going 
to catch the ball. He airs it out every time and he's been doing that for a 
second-division team." 
</P>
<P>
The Mets also gave up relief pitcher Roger McDowell, who was no longer being 
used in key situations, displaced as the set-up man for Randy Myers by Rick 
Aguilera. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson is now the only semi-regular remaining from the Mets' 1986 World Series 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
Said club President Frank Cashen: "I always thought we would win this year and 
then the next year would be our transition year. But after we suffered the 
debilitating injuries to Gary Carter and Keith Hernandez, we had to accelerate 
our thinking." 
</P>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA STORY 
</P>
<P>
Lee Thomas, hired a year ago as the Phillies' general manager, has been saying 
it will take three years to rebuild the team. 
</P>
<P>
He has acquired 17 players in the first year -- 14 by trade and three as free 
agents -- but it is difficult to determine how much is cosmetic and how much is 
substantive. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel and Bedrosian were two of the Phillies' toughest and most dependable 
players, yet the club was going nowhere with them. The question is, did Thomas 
give them up too cheaply, too prematurely? 
</P>
<P>
The stock answer in a week of stock exchanges: Time will tell.

CARTER HAS 3 OF 6 INDIAN HOMERS IN WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Carter hit three home runs in a game for the third time in his career, 
becoming the first major league player this season to do so, as the Cleveland 
Indians used the long ball to beat the Texas Rangers, 7-3, Saturday night at 
Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians, who snapped both their own four-game losing streak and Texas' 
three-game winning streak, managed only six hits, but all of them were homers. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're going good, the balls jump off your bat," Carter said. "When 
you're swinging terrible, you pop those balls up. This was one of those days 
when I was on every pitch." 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers' Charlie Hough (5-7) was victimized by five of the Indian homers -- 
a Texas franchise record -- including the three solo shots by Carter and Andy 
Allanson's two-run homer in the seventh that broke a 3-3 tie. The homers gave 
Carter 12 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Cory Snyder hit the other Cleveland homer, off Ken Rogers in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's Greg Swindell (10-1) scattered 10 hits, struck out five and walked 
two before he was replaced in the seventh by reliever Greg Jones, who earned 
his 16th save.

TRAIL BLAZERS TRADE BOWIE, NO. 12 PICK IN DRAFT TO NETS FOR BUCK WILLIAMS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Portland Trail Blazers acquired veteran power forward Buck Williams from 
the New Jersey Nets Saturday in exchange for oft-injured center-forward Sam 
Bowie and the 12th pick in Tuesday's National Basketball Assn. draft. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-8, 225-pound Williams has averaged 16.4 points and 11.9 rebounds a 
game in eight seasons and has appeared in three NBA All-Star games. 
</P>
<P>
Bowie, who has missed much of his professional and college career with broken 
bones in both legs, played in 20 games last season after recovering from a 
broken right tibia suffered in November 1986. 
</P>
<P>
He averaged 8.6 points and 5.3 rebounds last season. 
</P>
<P>
"What's so interesting about the trade was that Portland was able to keep its 
starting lineup intact and still add a quality player," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always difficult to leave your first love," he said. "I just hope 
Portland is my new love." 
</P>
<P>
Williams has been coveted by the Trail Blazers for some time. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been trying to do something, but the price had always been one of our 
nucleus (of top players)," Bucky Buckwalter, the Blazers' vice president for 
player personnel, said. "To get him without giving up one of our starters, we 
felt good about that."

HOOSIER HALL OF FAME; 
</P>
<P>
NEW CASTLE, IND., WILL BE HOME OF $2.5-MILLION PREP BASKETBALL SHRINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
NEW CASTLE, Ind. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ron Newlin stood on a rise in this rolling hill country, 35 miles east of 
Indianapolis, gazing in wonder at the nearly completed building, then shot a 
roll of film, getting progress photos of the construction project. 
</P>
<P>
"It should be finished (soon)," he said. "It will take seven or eight months 
after that to set all the exhibits in place. We hope to be open in time for the 
state tournament next March." 
</P>
<P>
Newlin, 30, is executive director of the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame, soon 
to be located here in New Castle in its first permanent home, a $2.5-million 
shrine to the favorite game of Hoosiers. 
</P>
<P>
"There's the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass., dedicated to the 
game played all over the United States, but no other state has anything like 
this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame represents the spirit, the values, the 
tradition of being a Hoosier. This museum will salute the schools, the players, 
the coaches, the communities that have made Indiana the nation's basketball 
leader." 
</P>
<P>
Basketball was invented by James Naismith in Springfield, Mass., in 1891 and 
was first played in Indiana in 1894 at the Crawfordsville YMCA. Since then, 
more than 250,000 Hoosiers, boys and girls, have played the game on the high 
school varsity level and worn the colors of 1,200 different schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Indiana has been absolutely nuts about basketball since the first state 
championship tournament in 1911," Newlin said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is by far the most important sport in the state, outdistancing football and 
baseball in popularity. Hoosier hysteria over basketball is part of our 
culture, part of what Indiana is all about. On a per-capita basis, Indiana has 
produced more professional basketball players than any other state." 
</P>
<P>
He rattled off the names of such Hoosier hoop luminaries as John Wooden, Oscar 
Robertson and Larry Bird. He told how the state tournament each year draws more 
than a million fans. He mentioned that Indiana has eight high school basketball 
gyms that seat more than 7,000 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
"No other state can say that," he boasted. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Fame crowns a hill next to New Castle's Chrysler High School, which 
has the biggest prep basketball gym in the world, seating 9,350. 
</P>
<P>
The Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame has captured the imagination and pride of 
people all over the state, from Aberdeen to Zipp and Zulu, in Indianapolis, 
Evansville, Terre Haute, Lafayette, Gary, Elkhart, South Bend, Anderson, 
Muncie, Marion and Bloomington, in Young America, Windfall, Wawpecong, Mongo 
and Old Tip Town. 
</P>
<P>
Henry County, in which New Castle is located, passed a 1% restaurant and 
beverage tax to raise $1 million toward the Hall of Fame's cost, and last 
month, donations from individuals and groups had exceeded $1 million. Marsh, an 
Indiana supermarket chain, gave $200,000. Two well-heeled Hoosiers each kicked 
in $25,000. There are Hall of Fame committees in every one of the state's 92 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
A half-million dollars has been raised in the "sale" of bricks -- 2,500 that 
went for $100 each and 500 more that sold for $500 each. In the center of the 
Hall of Fame's courtyard, a 70 x 36-foot map of Indiana will be made up of the 
$100 bricks, containing donors' names, and the $500 bricks will be inscribed 
with names of teams and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Botany Prof. Robert Hoshaw, 67, teaching at the University of Arizona in Tucson 
for the last 39 years, is typical of how many former Hoosiers have reacted to 
the hall.He said that he and the five other surviving members of the 1939 
seven-man Monticello High School basketball team each purchased a $100 brick. 
</P>
<P>
"Our school had less than 200 students," he said. "We had a great team 50 years 
ago. We wound up in the regional final, one of the top 32 schools in the state. 
Four of us went into teaching, one into insurance, one became a judge in the 
Chicago area, and one of the fellows died. 
</P>
<P>
"As part of Hoosier Hysteria, we figured it was only right we do our part in 
contributing to the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame. Twenty of us from 
Monticello High each also chipped in $25 to buy a brick in memory of our 
outstanding basketball coach, the late Alva Staggs." 
</P>
<P>
Sam Alford, 46, basketball coach at Chrysler High the last 14 years, is the 
father of Steve Alford, 24, former All-American at Indiana University, now with 
the Golden State Warriors. The Alford family bought a brick, since five Alfords 
played basketball in Indiana -- Sam's father, Sam and his brother, and Sam's 
two sons. 
</P>
<P>
"The five of us scored 8,000 points playing basketball in Indiana in high 
school and college," Alford said. 
</P>
<P>
Megaphones, trophies, uniforms, letter jackets, game balls, cheerleader 
sweaters, yearbooks, scrapbooks, class rings, mascots and other basketball 
memorabilia is pouring into the hall's temporary office in what was an old 
school building in downtown Indianapolis, at 520 Virginia Ave. 
</P>
<P>
"Team nicknames are something else," Newlin said, laughing. "Epson Salts for 
Epson High School. I thought the Monroe City Blue Jeans came by their name 
because there was a denim factory in town. I was wrong. It came from an 
early-day governor, who lived in Monroe City, James (Blue Jeans) Williams." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, there have been 1,200 high schools in the state that put 
basketball teams on the floor. Today, because of consolidations, Indiana has 
400 high school teams. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have something from every high school that ever had a team," Newlin 
said. "Alumni are tickled pink to have a chance to do something for the old 
alma mater." 
</P>
<P>
Every day's mail brings something new. James Griffin sent in scores he compiled 
of every state tournament played in the last 78 years from the sectional level 
through the state final. 
</P>
<P>
The letter jacket of Larry Hobson, holder of a single-season scoring record at 
Pekin High, where he averaged 30.2 points a game in 1963, is in the stack of 
memorabilia. So are one 1904 player's heavy-duty pants, used to play on an 
outdoor cinder parking lot at Freelandville High. 
</P>
<P>
The hall will chronicle and preserve the heritage of the game as played by the 
thousands of teams in the Hoosier state, and will depict through exhibits, film 
footage and video what basketball means to the state's culture, history and 
personality. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Carnegie, long-time track announcer for the Indianapolis 500-mile race, and 
businessman Ray Johnson, both members of the Indianapolis downtown Lions Club, 
came up with the idea of a shrine dedicated to Hoosier Hysteria. 
</P>
<P>
In 1962, the first five of the 250 members of the Indiana Basketball Hall of 
Fame were selected: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wooden, who was on the 1927 Martinsville state championship team. He went 
on to become an All-American at Purdue and coached at South Bend Central High 
before moving to the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ward (Piggy) Lambert, Wooden's coach at Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Homer (Stoney) Stonebreaker, who played at Wingate, the little school that 
won the championship in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coach Ernest (Griz) Wagner and player Robert (Fuzzy) Vandenvere of Franklin 
High's Wonder Five that won three state titles in a row, 1920-22. 
</P>
<P>
To be selected to the Hall of Fame, a man or woman must have played or coached 
high school basketball in the state. Among the inductees are nearly 50 who went 
on to play pro ball. 
</P>
<P>
Players become eligible for induction 25 years after high school graduation, 
and coaches are eligible after accumulating 25 years of varsity experience or 
after retirement. 
</P>
<P>
A statewide board of 25 directors, all former high school basketball players or 
coaches, make the selections. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana clings to one-class basketball. Schools compete against one another in 
the state tournament regardless of size. Some years, big schools such as mighty 
Muncie Central, winner of the state title six times, more than any other 
school, are victorious. Other years, tiny schools such as Wingate, Thornton, 
Plymouth and Milan come out on top. 
</P>
<P>
The 1987 film "Hoosiers," starring Gene Hackman and Dennis Hopper, about a 
small high school winning the Indiana state championship, was inspired by the 
1954 victory of tiny Milan (pronounced here My-lan) over Muncie Central. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as the film 'Hoosiers' is concerned, it was one of the best movies ever 
made," Newlin said. "Theaters all over the state were jammed to see it." 
</P>
<P>
Last winter, Newlin traveled throughout Indiana, recording the sights and 
sounds of basketball games, capturing the essence of Hoosier Hysteria for the 
hall. He had already recorded chants down through the decades, such as the 
popular "Boom-a-lacka! Boom-a-lacka! Bow-wow-wow!" of the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in the state is excited about this," he said. "Admission will be 
free, or $1 at the most, with the gift shop and special all-star and old-timer 
hall of fame basketball games providing support along with donations. 
</P>
<P>
"The Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame will be another chapter of Indiana's 
incredible Hoosier Hysteria."

<P>
Mark and Christina Huckins were pretty sure they had a good thing going, but a 
phone call last year caught them by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
The Huckinses, owners of the Original Mr. Miniblind Inc. of Irvine, began 
franchising their miniblind sales and installation business in January, 1988. 
By September, they had signed up 20 dealers, all in California. 
</P>
<P>
Then they got a call from Nobu Hatanaka, executive vice president of Idea Link 
Japan Inc., an international matchmaker based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Less than six months later, they signed a deal to sell master franchise rights 
for Mr. Miniblind Japan to LEC Inc., a Tokyo housewares firm that Hatanaka 
calls the "Rubbermaid of Japan." As a master franchisee, LEC can franchise Mr. 
Miniblind to other firms in Japan. The Huckinses won't disclose exact terms, 
but said they received a cash payment in the high six figures and will get 
royalties from the Japanese operations. 
</P>
<P>
Not too long ago, American companies wanting to franchise in Japan needed to be 
big, well-known and patient. Deals such as the franchising of McDonald's or 
Kentucky Fried Chicken took years to hash out 
</P>
<P>
But as the Huckinses learned, that is no longer the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Healthy Japanese Market 
</P>
<P>
Changing economic and social conditions in Japan have created a healthy 
Japanese market for franchise rights offered by small and mid-sized U.S. 
companies. And the Japanese, who have a reputation as slow and formal 
negotiators, are snapping up deals at a pace that starts some entrepreneurial 
hearts afluttering in the United States. Experts believe that the number of 
master franchises sold by American firms in Japan has increased to about 100 
from 69 at the end of 1986, making it the No. 2 foreign market for U.S. 
franchises. 
</P>
<P>
Franchising specialists say increasing Japanese interest is driven by the 
decline in the value of the dollar, a need to diversify and a fascination with 
new products and services offered by American businesses. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some big Japanese companies are trying to reconcile the need to 
streamline their work forces and the traditional policy of lifetime employment. 
Buying franchises from U.S. companies is one way they can take care of a 
growing corps of under-utilized middle managers, said Candace Brosowsky, a 
spokeswoman for the International Franchise Assn. in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old trade group conducts several trade missions to Japan and other 
Asian countries each year. Under a federal privatization program, it recently 
took over most of the international franchise marketing duties once performed 
by the U.S. Department of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
One reason the Japanese are eager to acquire franchises from U.S. companies is 
that the dollar has lost almost half of its value against the yen over the past 
five years, allowing Japanese buyers to acquire more for their money. "They 
effectively get a 50% discount when they buy an American franchise," Brosowsky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When Profusion Systems Inc. of Aurora, Colo., sold a master franchise in Japan 
for $850,000 after a 14-day whirlwind courtship last year, the exchange rate 
was half of what it was in 1984. "It was like we were the Mexico of the world, 
and they were taking advantage of it and buying up as much as they could," said 
William Gabbard, president and founder of the high-tech plastics repairing 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growth of High-Tech 
</P>
<P>
In addition to favorable currency trends, a lot of the big trading and 
manufacturing companies in Japan are becoming more efficient and productive 
than they once were. As a result, they can produce more with fewer people. 
</P>
<P>
"But at the same time," Brosowsky said, "there is a cultural practice in Japan 
of lifetime employment. Buying a U.S. franchise becomes the perfect way to 
build a new business into which they can plug these under-utilized workers -- a 
lot of them in middle management -- without the costs and headaches of creating 
a business from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the growing Japanese hunger for U.S. franchises has been the 
maturation of Japan's high-technology industry, according to Pacific Rim 
observers. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, growth in the technology sector slowed in Japan, said Idea 
Link's Hatanaka. A number of smaller technology firms were acquired by bigger 
companies, while others simply went out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"A whole new era of business development dawned in Japan in 1985, with a 
dramatic acceleration of Japanese companies looking for opportunity to 
diversify or expand into various specialty niches," Hatanaka said. "With the 
high-tech companies gone, Japanese investors started looking into the niche 
businesses, the service businesses and franchising." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the Japanese investors are large corporations, said Anne Yumi Hayashi, 
assistant vice president of LCA-International, a New York-based competitor of 
Idea Link. 
</P>
<P>
"They are looking for new types of businesses they can put their older 
employees into so they don't have to lay them off," she said, "and they also 
are looking for new businesses, especially service business, that aren't in 
Japan yet." 
</P>
<P>
That has been important for the success of U.S. franchise sales in Japan, said 
John Emery, chairman of the finance department at California State University 
at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"Japanese companies are very market-share oriented," Emery said. "They want 
position in the market and aren't concerned about short-term profitability. 
Buying the master Japanese franchise for a U.S. business gives them 100% of the 
market right from the start." 
</P>
<P>
All of that has made Japan the second-largest foreign market for U.S. 
franchises behind Canada, according to the International Franchise Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Through 1986, the last year for which hard data exists, 69 U.S. firms had sold 
master franchises in Japan, the Department of Commerce reports, mostly for 
restaurants and other prepared food retail outlets. As of the end of 1986, 
those 69 master franchises had set up a total of 7,366 outlets throughout 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Identifying Hot Prospects 
</P>
<P>
Although more recent statistics are not available, several experts agreed that 
the number of U.S. firms with master franchises in Japan has grown to about 
100, a 44% increase in less than three years. And service businesses make up a 
growing percentage of the total, they said. 
</P>
<P>
The market has become so important that two Japanese consulting firms have 
financed U.S. operations whose sole function is to identify hot franchising 
prospects and introduce them to prospective buyers in Japan: Idea Link and 
LCA-International. 
</P>
<P>
Idea Link, with an office in Los Angeles and a 49% owner in Japan, has arranged 
seven successful deals since it was founded in 1985. It is about to close three 
more, said president and 51% owner Ichiro (Roy) Fujita. 
</P>
<P>
Its completed franchise deals include California Closet in Woodland Hills, the 
El Pollo Loco chain owned by Denny's Restaurants in La Mirada, Graphic Gallery 
art prints in Newport Beach and Johnny Rockets, a group of 1950s-themed diners 
based in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
Fujita said his firm is about to complete franchise sales for the Sizzler 
steakhouse chain owned by Collins Food International in Los Angeles, the Office 
Club warehouse outlets headquartered in Concord and the Medieval Times 
theater-restaurant in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
To help market its American clients, who don't pay a fee unless a deal is 
signed, Idea Link publishes a hot prospects magazine in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Until late last year, the magazine was a Japanese-language licensee of 
Irvine-based Entrepreneur magazine. Entrepreneur's owner, Peter Shea, also owns 
Stained Glass Overlay and has sold a master Japanese franchise for the firm 
through LCA-International. Shea's franchisees use a proprietary process to make 
regular glass windows look like stained glass. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Experience Typical 
</P>
<P>
Shea, who has studied the Japanese franchising scene for several years, said 
his experience with Stained Glass Overlay is typical of other small firms 
marketing franchises in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Shea sold the master franchise to a mid-sized Japanese company in the food 
market business. That firm, in turn, sold separate licenses in Japan's 47 
prefectures, or states, Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers included Nippon Steel and Ashai Glass, both giant manufacturing 
companies. "They bought the prefecture licenses so they could sell individual 
franchises to mid-management employees who wanted to retire early or whose jobs 
were being phased out," Shea said. 
</P>
<P>
Service businesses like Mr. Miniblind or Ceiling Doctor, a Canadian firm that 
cleans acoustic ceilings, are popular in Japan in part because of the 
increasing Westernization of that country. 
</P>
<P>
The desire to emulate American concepts and practices, including construction 
techniques, is creating a need for services that had no place in the Japan of a 
decade ago, said Hayashi of LCA-International. 
</P>
<P>
Her company, a franchise matchmaker similar to Idea Link, has put together 
about 20 deals in four years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
By traditional yardsticks of Japanese-American business negotiations, the Mr. 
Miniblind franchise sale was a pretty fast transaction. While it spanned nearly 
six months, it required only three negotiating sessions with LEC's president, 
Sadao Ishikawa. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Requires Little Investment 
</P>
<P>
Christina Huckins said the buyer was intrigued by the business because it is 
mobile and requires little investment in real estate, which is extremely 
expensive in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"But besides our concept being solid, I think he (Ishikawa) liked us," she 
said. "He said he started his business with his wife and liked it that Mark and 
I are in business together." 
</P>
<P>
Ishikawa, whose firm makes rubber and plastic household accessories sold in 
some 40,000 Japanese stores, told the Huckinses that he plans to offer Mr. 
Miniblind franchises to Japanese store owners who are looking for additional 
business opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
One unusual aspect of the deal was that all negotiating sessions with Ishikawa 
were conducted at Mr. Miniblind's tiny Irvine office. The Huckinses were never 
asked to travel to Japan, which may indicate how eager LEC was to close the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
The people at Environmental Air Protection in Spokane did go to Japan, but 
their franchising deal may have set a world record for speed. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which franchises a system for sanitizing air conditioning and 
heating system ducts, had a one-hour meeting with a prospect in Osaka during a 
trade mission to Japan and Taiwan last month. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, company officials signed a letter of intent to sell a master 
franchise to a mid-sized real estate development and building maintenance firm 
in Japan called Active Co. They also received a $1-million check. 
</P>
<P>
"And since we've been back, we've gotten half a dozen calls from 
representatives of other Japanese companies who met with us," said Richard 
Moore, vice president of operations for Environmental Air. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the dollar has regained some of its strength, franchising 
specialists don't expect much dampening of the Japanese appetite for U.S. 
franchises. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, said Brosowsky of the International Franchise Assn., a secondary 
market for franchises has begun to develop in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a trend yet," she said, "but we are seeing the growth of individual 
entrepreneurship in Japan. Some of the younger people no longer see working for 
Sony or Mitsubishi for their entire careers as the ultimate goal." 
</P>
<P>
Idea Link's Hatanaka agreed that the Japanese are undergoing profound changes 
in attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
"It is no longer true for everyone that to be successful is to work for all 
your life for one big company," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some younger Japanese are looking to entrepreneurial business careers. And 
franchising can be better than starting a business from scratch because it is 
lower risk. You get the know-how and support of the franchiser. And buying an 
American franchise, you also get the American image." 
</P>

<P>
What's behind last week's unprecedented move by U.S. computer and semiconductor 
leaders to form a company, called U.S. Memories Inc., to make memory chips? 
</P>
<P>
The industrial equivalent of the arms race in which staying ahead in the 
electronics industry is as critical to U.S. standing in the world as having the 
fastest fighter plane was in the military arms race. 
</P>
<P>
It's a peaceful competition for the most part -- although the Defense 
Department has an abiding interest in the latest technology -- with Japan 
instead of the Soviet Union as the United States' chief rival. 
</P>
<P>
But above all, it's a tough competition -- so tough that even International 
Business Machines, the largest computer company and a U.S. technological 
leader, realizes it will be vulnerable without a healthy American electronics 
industry around it. 
</P>
<P>
"IBM and the U.S. information industry face intense competition," IBM's 
President Jack D. Kuehler told the Senate subcommittee on competitiveness at 
recent hearings. In electronics, particularly, Kuehler testified, "we are 
concerned with the essential infrastructure of our industry, be it 
semiconductor chips, or tools, or test equipment. This infrastructure is 
important because semiconductor chips are at the heart of finished goods in 
many industries -- appliances, automobiles, consumer electronics, medical 
instruments and computers, to name a few," said Kuehler. 
</P>
<P>
How can a microscopic memory chip, costing less than $20, be the "heart" of so 
many products and industries? Because having the most advanced memory chips is 
the real key to competitiveness, Kuehler explained in an interview at IBM's 
headquarters in Armonk, N.Y. "A computer is only a package of the latest 
technology," he said. "And competitiveness is not a matter of how many geniuses 
your company has, but of price and performance" -- are you getting there first 
with the most. 
</P>
<P>
Kuehler, a 56-year-old engineer and IBM's chief technologist, is talking about 
semiconductor advances that have brought increased performance at lower price 
to computers -- and many other products -- in the last decade. Ten years ago, 
the basic memory chip held 16,000 bits of information -- the rough equivalent 
of 2,000 of the letters and numerals you are now reading. Today's standard chip 
holds 1 million bits -- or roughly 120,000 letters and numerals. Yet the 
1-million-bit chip costs no more today than the 16,000-bit chip did then -- 
and, allowing for inflation in the intervening years, costs far less. 
</P>
<P>
Since a personal computer uses 150 memory chips, at a rough cost of $1,000 to 
$2,000, it's clear that having the latest, cheapest and most powerful chips in 
your machine can make all the difference. "The principle is the same whether 
it's a workstation or a mainframe," says Kuehler. If you're behind, he says, 
you're not delivering a competitive product at a competitive price. 
</P>
<P>
So far, IBM has more than held its own in the memory chip race. In a month or 
so it will ship computers with chips containing 4 million bits of information 
-- the most advanced technology yet. 
</P>
<P>
But other U.S. electronics companies have been devastated, as Japanese 
competitors took the lead in semiconductors in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
It was money that did it. As recounted in "Competing for Control," a book on 
electronics competition by Michael Borrus, U.S. companies cut back capital 
spending in the 1974 recession but Japanese companies kept on building capacity 
and so had the products to grab market share when business turned up in the 
late 1970s. That was Japanese industry's entry into world semiconductor 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
By 1986 they had pulled ahead, following a competitive Armageddon in which 
Japanese companies lost $4 billion and U.S. companies $2 billion in 
semiconductor price wars. Many American companies retired from memory chip 
production after that, hoping to buy their components from Japanese or other 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
But soon it became clear that Japanese suppliers were also competitors in 
finished goods. NEC, now the largest maker of semiconductor components, is a 
challenger in supercomputers. Hitachi, Toshiba, Fujitsu -- all powerful in 
semiconductors -- are global competitors in computers, and telephones and 
appliances. 
</P>
<P>
So American firms had no choice but to keep up in memory chips, despite the 
increasing expense of the technology, which requires extraordinary 
vibration-free, dust-free factories. 
</P>
<P>
Even IBM, which spends $6 billion a year -- 10% of its $60-billion annual 
revenue -- on research feels the bills mounting. "To get the latest 
semiconductor technology means making a commitment of $250 million to $500 
million for a new plant," said Kuehler. "The financial gamble to remain 
competitive is escalating at an awesome rate." 
</P>
<P>
And IBM knows that whatever the cost of keeping up today, it will be higher 
tomorrow as attempts to pack more information on microchips demands expensive 
X-ray lithography -- a high-science process, explains Joseph Grenier of the San 
Jose research firm Dataquest, in which X-rays thrown off by accelerating 
electrons are used to imprint electrical circuits. 
</P>
<P>
IBM already has spent $350 million on an X-ray lithography plant at East 
Fishkill, N.Y., that will ultimately cost $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. effort -- IBM is the only American company pursuing X-ray 
lithography -- pales beside that of Japan, where 15 companies are planning 
X-ray lithography plants. 
</P>
<P>
Why are the Japanese doing that? "Because they look down the road and see 
future opportunities in all industries," says Jim George, vice president and 
general manager of memory products at Motorola. Just as Kuehler says, they know 
that spending the money to gain improved memory chips will yield world markets 
for all sorts of finished products. 
</P>
<P>
So last week, U.S. industry began pooling its resources to cope with the 
challenge. Computer competitors IBM, Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard, and 
the semiconductor rivals, Intel Corp, Advanced Micro Devices, National 
Semiconductor and LSI Logic, put up $50,000 apiece to launch U.S. Memories., a 
firm that will ultimately demand $500 million in equity financing, along with 
an equal amount of borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Be Questioned 
</P>
<P>
The founding companies are calling for other partners to join, and the venture 
already has the approval of Texas Instruments and Motorola, two persevering 
U.S. semiconductor makers. They see, as does IBM which is licensing its most 
advanced technology to the new firm, that the common effort is in the interests 
of all because it builds an "infrastructure" capable of assuring business for 
supplier firms and coming up with advances in manufacturing technology. It 
promises, in short, that the semiconductor electronics industry doesn't go the 
way of consumer electronics, which has practically disappeared in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the idea of direct competitors pooling resources is a departure in many 
ways from U.S. industrial tradition, and may be questioned on antitrust 
grounds. But some scholars hail the venture, seeing such cooperation as a 
necessary shift for antitrust law from a national to a global focus. 
</P>
<P>
Traditional antitrust thinking holds that consumers are better served by 
numerous fractionated suppliers, say Thomas Jorde and David Teece, professors 
at the UC Berkeley Schools of Law and of Business. "But in the world market, 
with a great diversity of innovation and suppliers, Jorde and Teece write in 
California Management Review, "consumers are more likely to be injured if U.S. 
firms attempt to go it alone, and lose out, or if they do nothing." In that 
case, Americans may end not only with fewer suppliers to the market, but also 
with fewer U.S. jobs and higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the industrial arms race is high stakes just like the military one -- 
but with the saving grace that peaceful competition yields more useful results. 
To be sure, advances in memory chips can bring more proficient gimmickry -- a 
more complex TV set, a hand-held VCR. But it also means computers that teach 
reading to children and adults alike; it means a better heart monitor in the 
hospital and a better pacemaker at home. It is, in short, a more worthy arms 
race -- and a critical one for U.S. industry, which is why it launched a common 
effort last week.

U.S. SLOW TO COMPUTE ON 'SUPER' SCALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
A highlight for many visitors to Apple Computer's headquarters in Cupertino, 
Calif., is a tour of the company's supercomputer center. There, coiled in a 
semicircle and encased in glass at the end of a hall checkerboarded in black 
and white tiles, stands Apple's bright purple Cray supercomputer. 
</P>
<P>
Given its hue and sleek art-Deco surroundings, it's no wonder critics once 
questioned whether Apple bought the $14.5-million machine to attract attention 
or to do serious work. "In the beginning, people didn't think we needed that 
much computing power to design personal computers," recalls Kent Koeninger, who 
helps Apple engineers use the Cray machine. "But you don't design Apple and 
Macintosh computers on paper in garages anymore." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Fully Embraced 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, supercomputers can be used to design everything from airplane wings to 
new drugs to personal computer circuitry. Capable of processing billions of 
mathematical operations per second, supercomputers allow scientists and 
engineers to test their theories in a fraction of the time it would take using 
conventional methods. Furthermore, scientists can simulate feats, such as 
exploding bombs, crashing cars and flying airplanes through vicious storms, 
that they wouldn't dare attempt in real life. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the power of supercomputers, government and industry analysts 
contend that the machines have not been fully embraced by American industry. 
And in the view of many experts, that is a key reason that the United States' 
pioneering and world-leading supercomputer industry could soon lag behind 
Japan's, like so many other industries that started here. 
</P>
<P>
The potential result, these analysts say, could be devastating. Not only could 
the United States lose its lead in the supercomputer industry, but in other 
industries, as well, because businesses are not taking advantage of the best 
tools available. 
</P>
<P>
For now, though, the spotlight is on the U.S. supercomputer industry. In the 
past two months alone, this $1 billion-a-year industry has fallen into 
unprecedented disarray. Control Data Corp., the industry pioneer and one of the 
nation's two active supercomputer makers, said in April it would close those 
operations after losing more than $350 million. Weeks later, Seymour Cray, 
founder and chief scientist of the remaining manufacturer, Cray Research, left 
the company to start anew with an untried supercomputer technology. For its 
part, Cray Research has said it expects sales to rise just 10% this year, and 
analysts are estimating a profit decline of about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, one of the three giant Japanese electronics companies in the field, 
NEC, has unveiled plans to manufacture what it claims is the fastest-ever 
supercomputer. 
</P>
<P>
With the cutting edge of the most advanced technology known to man at stake, 
there has been no small amount of attention focused on the current problems. 
Efforts to diagnose and treat the industry's ills have focused primarily on 
Japan's superior chip-making technology and its long-recognized patience for 
nurturing nascent industries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government Uses 
</P>
<P>
But increasingly, analysts and engineers are looking at other factors, 
including the oft-ignored supercomputer buyer. The result: a dawning 
realization that, unlike the Japanese, U.S. industry has, so far, been 
reluctant to make the huge investments of cash and manpower necessary to 
support the supercomputer industry. 
</P>
<P>
"In the U.S., these machines are used for national security matters, defense 
and other government oriented work," says Stan Mantel, an analyst with the 
Super Performance Computing Service in Palo Alto. "In a pure commercial sense, 
Japan has the leg up. You can argue that bigger and better machines give you 
bigger and better answers, and, in some cases, answers that you would never get 
without these machines." 
</P>
<P>
Some engineers argue that at least a portion of the problems plaguing America's 
supercomputer industry -- as well as the global competitiveness of other key 
businesses -- could be solved if U.S. companies would take advantage of the 
latest and best technology available. Many point out that their Japanese 
counterparts already have done just that. 
</P>
<P>
And, certainly, the U.S. government has. Since the advent of the supercomputer 
more than a decade ago, the U.S. government has been, by far, its largest user, 
accounting for 101 of the 199 supercomputers installed nationwide as of the end 
of 1988. Department of Energy officials estimate that at nuclear weapons 
research laboratories, alone, there are about two dozen machines. 
</P>
<P>
According to a year-end 1988 survey by the Super Performance Computing Service, 
only 74, or 37%, of the nation's supercomputers were installed in private 
businesses. (The survey does not include high-performance machines built by 
International Business Machines whose status as supercomputers is still hotly 
debated.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Japan Differs 
</P>
<P>
The situation is far different in Japan. According to the same survey, the 
Japanese government has 17 of the 104 installations, universities have 27 and 
private industry has 60 machines, or 58% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
Also telling is the industry-by-industry breakdown of where these machines are 
used. 
</P>
<P>
For example, 21 of the 60 industrial installations in Japan are in the 
electronics industry. In the United States, Apple Computer, which uses its 
machine to simulate circuits and for such advanced technology research as 
speech recognition, is one of just five electronics makers to own a 
supercomputer, and the only one in the Silicon Valley, the site of the nation's 
largest concentration of high-technology operations. 
</P>
<P>
Auto makers in Japan account for 11 machines; in the United States, the total 
is three, one for each of the major manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
However, 29, or nearly 40%, of the supercomputers used in private enterprise in 
the U.S. are in aerospace companies. In Japan, aerospace companies account for 
just five installations. 
</P>
<P>
Some find the differences appalling. 
</P>
<P>
"We have treated these machines primarily as defense systems, not as general 
scientific discovery, design and productivity tools," argues Larry Smarr, 
director of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the 
University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana, one of five such university 
research facilities throughout the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese, on the other hand, realized that they were a key technology to 
important business sectors for the next several decades and proceeded to so 
position them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need Questioned 
</P>
<P>
Adds Charles Ferguson, a research associate at the Center for Technology, 
Policy and Industrial Development at MIT: "Both the Japanese and U.S. 
governments have supported their supercomputer industries over the years. But 
the goal of the Japanese government has been to make their industries ready to 
compete in the world economy. Our goal has been national security." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, many U.S. corporations would argue that they already have as much 
supercomputing power as they need. Dozens of companies lease the power through 
time-sharing networks operated by supercomputer owners. Others are corporate 
partners at one of the five university research facilities. And still many, 
many more companies own machines known as "mini-supers," which offer some of 
the capabilities and power of a full-fledged supercomputer. 
</P>
<P>
Many corporations argue that business problems don't necessarily require the 
enormous power of a supercomputer, a $20-million piece of hardware steadily 
heading toward obsolescence. Furthermore, companies say they are particularly 
reluctant to purchase the hardware when they may lack two other key 
ingredients: adequately trained engineers to use the machines and a range of 
software to take full advantage of its powers. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the experience of Kodak. For nearly three years the camera and film 
maker has been an industrial partner at the University of Illinois 
supercomputer center, spending just over $1 million annually for all the 
supercomputing its U.S. engineers need. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership, says Lawrence A. Ray, a senior research scientist who is 
Kodak's man on campus, is supposed to help the company decide if it wants to 
buy its own machine. So far, there's been no rush to make the buy. 
</P>
<P>
"The best solution is to belong to a center like this so you don't have the 
facilities, staffing and all the rest to maintain," Ray says. 
</P>
<P>
But even more importantly, he argues, many engineers just don't know how to use 
a supercomputer effectively. And many, already accustomed to the desktop 
computer revolution that brought powerful personal workstations, are reluctant 
to work again on a machine they must share with scores of other engineers. 
</P>
<P>
"Buying the Cray is the easy part," Ray says. "Once you have it, you have to 
use it and that's the hard part." 
</P>
<P>
Ray says engineers typically develop projects based on the size of the tools -- 
the computers -- they have available. With the increased power of a 
supercomputer, engineers must learn how to increase the scope of the problems 
they can tackle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Training Required 
</P>
<P>
According to some estimates, it typically takes engineers, even highly educated 
and skilled ones, from 18 months to three years to learn to use a supercomputer 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Such arguments are the major reason why the supercomputer centers, such as the 
one in Illinois, were established in 1986. The theory is that as engineers are 
exposed to these machines, they will begin to think in the large-scale terms 
necessary to make best use of supercomputers. 
</P>
<P>
"You need trained drivers for these machines and people are not being trained 
to use them in industry. That's the real root of our problem," says C. Gordon 
Bell, an electronics industry pioneer, former National Science Foundation 
computing director and now the chairman of Ardent Corp., a mini-supercomputer 
maker in the Silicon Valley. "There would be a higher demand for these machines 
in industry if more people knew how to use them effectively." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to train more non-defense-oriented users, now largely confined to the 
five supercomputer centers established in 1986, may soon get a big boost. 
</P>
<P>
Last month U.S. Senator Albert Gore (D-Tenn.) introduced a bill to spend more 
than $1.3 billion over the next five years to install supercomputers in 
university and other research centers. The bill would also create a data 
network to connect the nation's supercomputers. Although similar proposals have 
died in prior years, recent events in the supercomputer industry have increased 
the chances of passage for the current bill. 
</P>
<P>
Says an aide to Gore: "U.S. industry hasn't gotten the message as quickly as 
businesses in Japan. That's why these university and research centers are so 
important." 
</P>
<P>
Adds Lauren Kelley, the supercomputer analyst for the U.S. Department of 
Commerce: "The writing is on the wall for the U.S. supercomputer industry if 
there are no changes in how we approach it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IBM Enters Market 
</P>
<P>
In the private sector, there are signs of change emerging, too. 
</P>
<P>
After years of ignoring the supercomputer market, IBM over the past year has 
taken major steps toward becoming a significant participant. It has introduced 
special accessories for its more powerful mainframe computer that permit 
"vector-style" scientific computing. Analysts estimate that there already are 
500 of these machines installed throughout the world, about 200 more than all 
other supercomputers combined. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its own research, and perhaps even more important, is IBM's 
investment last year in Supercomputer Systems Inc., a new company founded 18 
months ago by Steve Chen, a Cray Research defector considered among the most 
brilliant computer designers in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts speculate that IBM may have an easier time selling its supercomputers 
to U.S. corporations than have Cray and Control Data. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of 'True Blue' customers out there who will follow IBM 
anywhere," says Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock 
newsletter. "When IBM blesses something, especially something with scientific 
aspects, a lot of data processing managers listen." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect that whatever supercomputer IBM finally introduces, it will be 
able to share data with the company's mainframes, a factor that will allow data 
processing managers to integrate all of their IBM equipment. 
</P>
<P>
And as the supercomputer becomes more compatible with existing computer 
systems, analysts say, industry use should increase. Outside of scientific 
fields, potential applications for the machines include investment banking, 
investment portfolio modeling, construction and the entire health care field. 
</P>
<P>
"The real question is not whether we have the best supercomputers, but whether 
we build the best cars, electronic circuits, airplanes and the like," says 
Chris Willard, an analyst with Dataquest, a Silicon Valley market research 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Adds analyst Stan Mantel: "The country that wins is not necessarily the country 
that produces these machines in the greatest quantity. It is the country that 
uses them the most effectively."

WHAT MAKES A COMPUTER SUPER?

<TEXT>
<P>
Want to start a high-tech metaphysical debate? Ask two engineers what 
constitutes a supercomputer. 
</P>
<P>
Many users define supercomputers as the fastest machines available on the 
market at any given time. Still others contend that there are qualitative 
differences that separate supercomputers from the rest of the pack. 
</P>
<P>
Among these differences are price -- supercomputers cost well over $1 million 
each -- and how supercomputers process data. Traditional computers process 
digits or numbers sequentially, one-by-one, adding two numbers together, then 
multiplying the sum by another number, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
Supercomputers, instead, use "vector processing," which allows the machine to 
perform a single calculation on an entire row or column, with just a single 
instruction. It's a far faster process and typically suited to large scientific 
problems. According to some accounts, problems that could take 24 hours to 
solve on a traditional minicomputer, such as a VAX3 from Digital Equipment 
Corp., could be completed in less than an hour on a Cray supercomputer. CARLA

THE DEATH OF Z CHANNEL -- WHAT NOW?; 
</P>
<P>
THE HISTORY; 
</P>
<P>
BESET BY TROUBLES, QUIRKY STATION WILL SWITCH TO ALL-SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

editor to the trade magazine Cable World.

<TEXT>
<P>
When Henry Fonda rides off into the sunset at the end of "My Darlin' 
Clementine" on Z Channel Thursday night, he'll be taking a piece of Los Angeles 
TV history with him. 
</P>
<P>
The eclectic Z Channel, programmed for film lovers of all stripes, is being 
shuttered in favor of an all-sports service from the new owners, New York-based 
Cablevision Systems Corp. and NBC. 
</P>
<P>
The John Ford film, Z's last telecast as Z Channel, is a sentimental farewell: 
The film was a favorite of Jerry Harvey, the passionate but troubled programmer 
who was the driving force behind Z. 
</P>
<P>
The switch to SportsChannel Los Angeles is the final sad passage in what has 
been a tragic 15 months for Los Angeles' beloved home-grown pay service. In 
April, 1988, Z abandoned its all-film format to include a sprinkling of local 
sports events. That same month (but apparently for unrelated reasons), Harvey 
shot and killed his wife and himself. In the following months, Z Channel lost a 
legal battle with Home Box Office and four motion picture studios over carrying 
advertising during its sports programming. The owners hoped the sports 
telecasts would broaden Z's appeal enough to cover their $10-million 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
Last March, they threw in the towel, selling Z to Cablevision, a cable company 
that operates six other regional cable sports services and SportsChannel 
America, a national programming service launched in January. Z's fate was 
sealed. 
</P>
<P>
The Z Channel was one of the oldest pay-TV services in the country. It was 
started by local cable system Theta Cable in 1974, but its heyday in the 1980s 
was sparked by the singular, sometimes quirky vision of Harvey, a screenwriter 
and film savant who guided the channel for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Where other pay services tread cautiously, banking on mainstream movies and 
middle-of-the-road entertainment, Harvey spurned the programming-by-committee 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
He filled Z Channel with things he liked to watch: John Ford films, strange B 
movies, original versions of films that long ago had given way to edited 
versions. He broke every rule that other pay-TV programmers lived by. He ran 
silent films, he played black-and-white movies in prime time, he featured 
foreign films. He even ran turkeys and encouraged the audience to enjoy them 
for their camp value. 
</P>
<P>
The formula worked. When Group W Cable, which bought Theta in 1980, offered 
Home Box Office, Showtime and The Movie Channel to its subscribers in 1982, Z 
Channel held on to its sizable market share, outselling the majors 3-to-1. When 
other services were plagued by disconnects, Z Channel's audience remained 
steady and loyal. 
</P>
<P>
Later that year, Harvey tweaked Hollywood and set the pay-TV business on its 
ear by telecasting director Michael Cimino's original cut of "Heaven's Gate," 
the box-office disaster that United Artists had drastically shortened before 
its Los Angeles release. In a Christmas Eve showing, "Heaven's Gate" became the 
most watched feature ever shown on Z Channel. 
</P>
<P>
The other pay services sheepishly lined up to license the picture, but Harvey 
remained yards ahead of them. Over the next few years, he badgered, wheedled 
and nagged the studios to dig down into their vaults for lost films or the 
missing parts to films that had been torn apart in long-forgotten engagements 
in the war between directors and their studios. 
</P>
<P>
Z Channel wasn't programmed solely for the cinemaphile. There was an air of 
accessibility about the service that extended even to its most esoteric fare -- 
an attitude fostered by the excellent critical film magazine that Z published 
each month. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey and his staff packaged films in a way that set a standard for the 
industry. A slew of bad horror films would become the "Sweet Screams" series. 
</P>
<P>
"We would do festivals just to celebrate someone we liked," recalled F.X. 
Feeney, a Harvey cohort who wrote reviews for the magazine and acted as a 
special consultant to the channel. 
</P>
<P>
The list of who Z Channel and Harvey liked was long and varied: actors (the 
service once ran a festival featuring the then-slim film portfolio of actress 
Phoebe Cates) and directors (another of Harvey's rescue efforts was for Michael 
Cimino's maligned 1987 film "Year of the Dragon," which was featured on Z 
Channel magazine's cover) and genres, including B movies so bad that the Z 
Channel reviews frankly panned them. 
</P>
<P>
Other cable programmers admit that Z Channel influenced them but in the next 
breath point out that Z operated in the world's film capital, which they 
maintain is more eclectic in its movie tastes than the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
"It was wonderful, but it wasn't always commercial," said Lisa Mateas, director 
of program acquisitions for Turner Network Television. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey always battled that perception. In an interview three years ago, in the 
midst of one of Z Channel's many transitions, he said: "Do they think people 
don't love movies in St. Louis, in Minneapolis? This thing would work anywhere 
there are film lovers." 
</P>
<P>
But by the mid-1980s, Z Channel was beginning to feel the crunch of 
competition. Subscribership dipped from more than 90,000 to about 85,000 as 
Group W put the marketing of Z Channel on the back burner and prepared to sell 
its cable systems. The consortium that next took control made it clear that Z 
would be unloaded as soon as a buyer was found. 
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneur Gordon Rock eventually was persuaded to invest $4.5 million in Z 
Channel. For a while, things looked promising. 
</P>
<P>
New executives were brought on board, but Harvey was given a long-term contract 
to continue programming Z the way he saw fit. There were plans to put Z on 
satellite to serve all of Southern California and even talk of creating a 
network of Z Channels across the country. 
</P>
<P>
It never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, in 1988, hoping to increase interest in the channel by dropping the 
all-movie format, Rock Associates and two new partners concluded a deal with 
the Dodgers, the Angels and the Clippers. Subscribership initially jumped to 
110,000, but the deal was to have fatal consequences for Z. 
</P>
<P>
To finance the $5-million sports package, Z needed to sell advertising during 
the games. The idea wasn't without precedent. The Prism service in Philadelphia 
runs sports and movies and carries advertising. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey's violent death cast a pall on the service, but it was the failure to 
win a lawsuit against Home Box Office and four Hollywood movie studios that 
finished Z. The legal verdict prevented it from selling ads during its sports 
events -- on the grounds that its contracts with the studios stipulated that 
the service be commercial-free -- and put Z Channel on the sales block again. 
</P>
<P>
Cablevision, seeing an opportunity to get its SportsChannel America service 
into the nation's second largest market, grabbed it. 
</P>
<P>
SportsChannel hopes its all-sports lineup eventually will push its 
subscribership to 2 million in Southern California, Arizona and Nevada. The 
plan may be working. After a marketing drive this spring, Z subscribership is 
up to 135,000 from the 85,000 that it had maintained for the past few years.

There'll never be another Z Channel. It was one-of-a-kind television, shaped by 
a personal vision and guided by eclectic tastes. But there are other pay-TV and 
basic-cable channels that Z viewers can turn to, even if their tastes run to 
offbeat films, little-known works of famous directors and foreign films with 
sensible subtitles instead of out-of-sync dubbing. They just won't find 
everything in one place anymore. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a viewer's guide to the other cable channels that primarily run movies: 
</P>
<P>
Mainstream movies. Pick any pay service. Home Box Office, Cinemax, Showtime and 
The Movie Channel carry blockbuster hits and most other mainstream Hollywood 
releases. But be advised that, in a battle to tie up exclusive rights to film 
titles, rivals HBO and Showtime have divvied up the output of most of the major 
Hollywood studios. Look for this summer's blockbuster Paramount hits "Indiana 
Jones and the Last Crusade" and "Star Trek V" and Warner Bros.' "Batman" on HBO 
and its sister service Cinemax. Showtime and The Movie Channel, on the other 
hand, have a long-term lease on Disney's Touchstone films, including "Who 
Framed Roger Rabbit," Bette Midler's films and Tom Hanks' upcoming "Turner and 
Hootch." Also in Showtime's stable: the "Rambo" films and pictures from 
producer-directors Rob Reiner, Taylor Hackford and Ron Howard. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign films. Forget subtitled versions when it comes to the two major pay 
services, HBO and Showtime. Programmers say Middle America prefers dubbed 
versions, so they banish subtitled films to the wee hours. Even Cinemax and The 
Movie Channel are cautious; both look for Academy Award-winning films such as 
Sweden's "My Life as a Dog" and tend to shun riskier fare. Neither, for 
example, has scheduled Jean-Jacques Beiniex's steamy "Betty Blue." You'll have 
better luck with Bravo and Arts &amp; Entertainment Network, which schedule 
foreign films (usually with subtitles) every month. Bravo offers Claude Berri's 
"Jean Mon Amour" in July. Arts &amp; Entertainment Network's "Screening Room" 
series turns up treats from time to time: Look for "La Nuit de Varennes" July 4 
and China's "Yellow Earth" in October. 
</P>
<P>
Treasures from the vault. Turner Network Television, Ted Turner's grand 
challenger to network television, has earned itself a neat little reputation 
for its own cache of screen gems. On June 13, the basic cable service aired the 
original black-and-white version of Richard Brooks' "Blackboard Jungle" (Turner 
colorized the movie earlier this year) and dug up a rarely seen series of RKO 
films known as "The Falcon Mysteries." Another basic cable channel, American 
Movie Classics, seeks to deliver what its name promises: John Ford's "Fort 
Apache," "Murder Inc." and the original "Heaven Can Wait" were unfurled this 
month. Since 1981, Showtime has had a showcase for MGM films each month. 
Sometimes they're dogs that don't even merit a mention in Showtime's guide, but 
you'll also find "Gigi," "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Silk Stockings." 
</P>
<P>
Bad Bs. Remember "The Attack of the 50-Foot Woman"? "Plan 9 from Outer Space"? 
"Glenn or Glenda"? Z Channel had a knack for giving you a reason to watch even 
the worst films. Sure, they were cheap time fillers, but Z never pulled any 
punches in letting you know just how bad these movies were. It had a "Best of 
the Worst" series and a "Worst of the Worst" series. The major pay services 
also face the need to fill time. Cinemax does it with what in corporatespeak is 
called "opportunistic umbrellas" -- that is, cute series names for bad movies. 
Under the umbrella this fall: the original "The Blob" and its 1988 remake. The 
Movie Channel has elevated the scheduling of bad movies to an art form with 
"Joe Bob Briggs' Drive-In Theater." Briggs (satirist John Bloom) rates films by 
the number of exposed body parts. Enough said. 
</P>
<P>
Restored films. It took Z Channel to unearth a rarity like director John Ford's 
"Up the River," the 1929 jailhouse comedy that featured the film debuts of 
Humphrey Bogart and Spencer Tracy. Sadly, hunting for rare films doesn't much 
interest the major pay services. Some pay homage to various directors and say 
they are open to opportunities to license restorations. The sensibilities may 
be slightly different. The Movie Channel last year ran a "Director's Cut" 
special on the hardly long-lost feature film "Manhunter" by "Miami Vice" 
producer Michael Mann. Things look better at TNT, which participated in the 
restoration of "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid," which was tracked down in TNT's 
MGM library by Jerry Harvey's Z Channel successor, Tim Ryerson. TNT is 
restoring most of its $1-billion library of MGM, RKO and pre-1949 Warner Bros. 
films. In March, TNT aired "Ben Hur" with a restored score. 
</P>
<P>
Imaginative Film Festivals. Z wrote the book on packaging, with festivals that 
ranged from a celebration of the films of French director Luis Bunuel to a 1986 
collection of potboilers called "Sexpots &amp; Sorcerers." All the pay services 
now program this way, with more or less success. Cinemax's "Vanguard" series 
features films it considers avant garde. The loopy "Baghdad Cafe" debuts today 
under the Vanguard label. Pairing original and new versions of films is 
popular: The Movie Channel did it in May with the French and U.S. versions of 
"Three Men and a Baby," under the clever title "Six Men and Two Babies." TNT 
reserves its overnight time periods for hard-core film buffs. To please them, 
TNT plans things like a Robert Armstrong festival after the July 18 prime-time 
triple-header of the original "King Kong," "Mighty Joe Young" and "Son of 
Kong." Armstrong was the non-simian male lead of "King Kong." 
</P>
<P>
Cinematic specials. Z specialized in delivering cinematic treats to viewers -- 
the 5 1/2-hour versions of Bernardo Bertolucci's "1900" and Ingmar Bergman's 
"Fanny and Alexander," the 6-hour version of the German war drama "Das Boot," 
the long and short versions of "Once Upon a Time in America." The other pay 
services occasionally followed suit. "Once Upon a Time in America" ran in its 
short and long versions on Cinemax and the Movie Channel. The Movie Channel 
will offer the 6-hour "Little Dorritt" in two-night segments in November or 
December. 
</P>
<P>
Great Guide. Z Channel's terrific program guide was the first thing sacrificed 
to the service's money problems last year. Unfortunately, you won't find its 
informed, opinionated like anywhere else in cable TV. HBO, Showtime, Cinemax 
and The Movie Channel offer throw-away guides with upbeat thumbnail 
descriptions of films. The Cable Guide resembles a pre-Rupert Murdoch TV Guide 
with occasional good articles but little critical material. American Movie 
Classics' monthly guide comes closest to the mark with some of its background 
pieces on the service's classic films. PEGGY ZIEGLER

R. CRUMB STILL CAN ZAP IT; 
</P>
<P>
THE KEEP ON TRUCKIN' CARTOONIST SURVIVED CELEBRITYHOOD AND IS CONTENT TO BE IN 
THE UNDERGROUND

"The instant I realized I was an outcast I became a critic, and I've been 
disgusted with American culture from the time I was a kid," says R. Crumb, the 
underground cartoonist who bequeathed the definitive acidhead mantra to the 
late '60s: "Keep on truckin'." 
</P>
<P>
"I started out by rejecting all the things that the people who rejected me 
liked, then over the years I developed a deeper analysis of these things." 
</P>
<P>
Many who have followed Robert Crumb's work since he launched the underground 
comics scene in the psychedelic '60s with the seminal publication "Zap Comix" 
agree that the 44-year-old artist is an uncommonly thoughtful observer of the 
passing parade. Hailed by art critic Robert Hughes as "an American Hogarth," 
Crumb brings intelligence and autobiographical candor to the form, in strips 
that spoof the inhibitions of middle-class America as they explore politics, 
sex and history. 
</P>
<P>
Crumb, whose cartoons currently are published in the quarterly magazines Weirdo 
and Hup, is afflicted with a compulsion to confess, and in his work he invites 
the reader into his psyche. In real life, however, the notoriously reclusive 
artist prefers to interact with his fellow man from a distance. Though Crumb 
experienced -- endured is how he would describe it -- a period of high-profile 
celebrityhood when he burst onto the scene, he has since removed himself from 
the media compost pile to the point that many who know of his work wonder: 
Whatever happened to R. Crumb? 
</P>
<P>
Well, for one thing, he surfaced in Hollywood last year. The virulent dislike 
of mass media that surfaces in nearly every strip he draws didn't stop him from 
having a go-round with the film industry. Considering that Crumb probably 
hasn't sat through a mainstream Hollywood feature in years, it's surprising 
that he applied himself to the task of writing a script; that this defiant 
iconoclast didn't get too far in Hollywood is less of a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and a friend of mine, Terry Zwigoff, wrote this script and took it to 
Hollywood and pitched it to different studios," he recalls, "and while the 
studio people seemed to find me an amusing character, the script was way too 
offbeat for the Hollywood machine. It's based on a comic I did years ago about 
this wimpy guy who falls in love with a female sasquatch (huge, hairy creatures 
said to live in the mountains of North America), and gets abducted in the 
woods. It's a humorous, sex, burlesque story and it's pretty weird. I wasn't 
too good at selling it either -- I kept saying the wrong things to these studio 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember one night I was at this industry-type dinner party and in the 
course of the dinner table conversation I commented that to be a real, sincere 
artist in America is to be a loser in society. All these wealthy industry types 
really seemed to take offense at that," he says with a laugh. "So, nothing's 
happened with the script, but that doesn't break my heart because I'd rather 
just do comics. If I manage to turn out three issues of Hup a year, I'm 
completely happy." 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, these days, you find Crumb at his picturesque home in this rural town 
west of Sacramento. The visitor is pleasantly surprised to find he's not quite 
the curmudgeon or the drooling pervert that he depicts himself to be in his 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"I draw myself to look grotesque because if I drew myself better looking, 
people would say, 'Gee, he doesn't look as good as he thinks he does,' " he 
says, laughing. "This way, they say, 'Oh, you look much better than your 
drawings!' " 
</P>
<P>
Crumb's appearance may be a surprise, but the way he lives is exactly as one 
might expect. Crumb's detractors often accuse him of being overly enamored with 
the past, and the house which he shares with his wife of 12 years, cartoonist 
Aline Kominsky Crumb, and their 7-year-old daughter, Sophie, is a virtual 
museum of Americana. Heated with a wood-burning stove, Crumb's home is a 
colorful preserve of vintage quilts, antique toys, kitsch souvenirs and folk 
art. An obsessive purist when it comes to music, Crumb listens only to old 78s 
of early blues, hillbilly and dance band music, and his collection of scratchy 
records occupies an honored spot in the house. 
</P>
<P>
Crumb's idyllic country home is diametrically opposed to the environment he 
grew up in, which he describes as "bleak, '50s tract-house America." Born in 
Philadelphia, one of five children of a career Marine officer, Crumb drew his 
first comic, "Diffy in Shacktown," at the age of 7 and continued to escape into 
the world of cartoons throughout what he calls a miserable childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"My family was completely crazy," he recalls. "I had a very rootless 
upbringing, and we moved around a lot because my father was in the Marines. My 
mother had personal problems all through the '50s and '60s, and my parents 
fought constantly. 
</P>
<P>
A painfully thin young man who spent his high school years minus his two front 
teeth after a bully knocked them out with a rock, Crumb toyed with the idea of 
suicide throughout his adolescence, while sinking ever deeper into the 
alienation that continues to fuel his creative drive. "As a teen-ager, there 
was no place where I fit in at all," he recalls. "I saw no hope of ever 
connecting with anything." 
</P>
<P>
Crumb detected the glimmerings of hope when he discovered Mad magazine, a 
leading voice of dissent during its golden period of the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
"Mad regurgitated 1950s America in an incredibly brilliant way and was a big 
inspiration to me," recalls Crumb, who had committed himself to a career as a 
cartoonist by the time he was 16. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to see Mad's influence on Crumb's work; the presence of his other 
artist hero, 16th-Century Flemish genre painter Pieter Bruegel, is a bit more 
subtle but is definitely there. . . . Crumb is, in a sense, a genre artist. 
</P>
<P>
"What amazes me about Bruegel is that it's impossible to find his ego in his 
work," Crumb enthuses. "He created such a dispassionate reflection of the world 
around him, but at the same time, he was caught up in the attitudes of his 
time. To me, he's the perfect painter." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his admiration for practitioners of fine art such as Bruegel, German 
Expressionists Otto Dix and Max Beckmann and for English caricaturists George 
Cruikshank and James Gillray, Crumb opted for a career in popular art, a career 
that began in 1962 when he moved to Cleveland and landed a job designing 
greeting cards for American Greetings Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In 1964, Crumb married his first wife, Dana Morgan, and the following year 
ingested his first tab of LSD -- a substance that was to play a big role in his 
life for the next eight years. In 1967 he moved to San Francisco -- the center 
of the hipsters' universe at the time -- and was launched on the burst of 
creativity that established his career. In short order he completed the first 
issue of Zap, introduced his most popular characters, Fritz the Cat and 
capitalistic guru Mr. Natural, and left his brand on the hippie movement with 
his graphic haiku, "Keep on truckin'." The quality and quantity of work he 
produced over the next four years won him a devoted following that constitutes 
the core of his audience today. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll never be able to shake that Mr. '60s crap," he grumbles, "and it's really 
annoying that 'Keep on truckin' is seen as my trademark. Imagine being branded 
with something you casually threw out in April, 1967, that somehow catches the 
popular imagination and follows you to your grave. I can see 'Keep on truckin' 
engraved on my tombstone." 
</P>
<P>
Crumb's work of the late '60s made him famous, but it didn't make him rich. In 
fact, he lived on welfare into the early '70s, and the popularity of the work 
left him tangled in a web of legal and financial troubles that plagued him 
until 1982. In 1970, he sold the rights to Fritz the Cat, which wound up being 
made into a film he despised, and in 1973 his Zap No. 4 edition was declared 
obscene in several courts across the country. He says he was bilked out of the 
copyright to "Keep on truckin', " which was declared public domain in 1976, the 
same year that the IRS hit him with a bill for $30,000 in back taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"I was naive and got caught up in the backwash of the '60s," he recalls. "I was 
a kid and all I wanted was to do the work. I wasn't interested in dealing with 
money, so I attracted a lot of fast-talking people eager to deal with it for 
me. Most artists I know who are good at negotiating are not very good artists." 
</P>
<P>
Depressed and even more suspicious of his fellow man, Crumb began the retreat 
from the limelight that has led to the hermitic existence he currently 
maintains. In 1972, he formed a musical trio, the Keep On Truckin' Orchestra 
(rechristened the Cheap Suit Serenaders the following year), and the group 
recorded two albums and toured extensively in 1975-76. That experience 
permanently soured Crumb on celebrityhood, and he quit the group in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"People who want to be famous don't know what they're getting into. Once I got 
famous I saw a side of humanity I'd never seen before. People who don't even 
know your work want to glom onto you just because you're famous. It's a 
nauseating aspect of human nature that people worship power -- that's one of 
things about mankind that I find truly reprehensible." 
</P>
<P>
Considering that Crumb distrusts the media and only ventures outside his door 
when it's absolutely necessary, one wonders what shapes his sense of what is 
going on in the culture. 
</P>
<P>
"All you have to do is walk into a supermarket to know what's going on in this 
country," he comments. "If you train yourself to observe what's going on around 
you and look closely at the details of everyday life, it's all there. As to 
what I see going on right now, America has become a very frightening country, 
and if you think about it too much you just get sick." 
</P>
<P>
Crumb's concern about the bigotry, pollution, illiteracy and corruption that he 
feels are poisoning this country is mirrored in his Expressionist depiction of 
America as a country in the process of decay, a corroded, withered and gnarled 
place. 
</P>
<P>
While Crumb insists that he's not a political cartoonist, he does admit to 
feeling a kinship with William Hogarth and Thomas Nast, and that lineage is 
readily apparent in his work. More remarkable than Crumb's political 
consciousness, however, is his range. Speaking in the vernacular of the common 
man and tempering the serious themes in his work with frequent references to 
his libido, he spoofs egocentric artistic Angst in "The Snoid Goes Bohemian," 
debates the Buddhist philosophy of detachment in "Those Cute, Adorable Little 
Bearzy Wearzys," and tours 17th-Century London in "Boswell's London Journal," 
based on James Boswell's classic literary work of the same name. He takes on 
born-again Christianity in "Jesus People U.S.A. Interviews R. Crumb," offers a 
scholarly exposition on sexual deviance in "Psychopathia Sexualis" and picks 
through the wreckage of his own tormented sexual history in countless strips. 
</P>
<P>
Though Crumb is free to spend as much time as he chooses at the drawing table, 
he claims to be incapable of maintaining a work schedule, and he confesses: "I 
go through long periods of agonizing over what I'm doing, and I've never been a 
facile draftsman -- I always have to struggle to figure out how to draw things. 
</P>
<P>
Asked how he perceives his work evolving, he replies "for starters, I dropped 
the early characters -- I have a contrary streak that won't allow me to feed 
people what they want. Beyond that, the work has become more serious and 
directly autobiographical. As I get more distance on my life, I'm able to 
recount my experiences in a deeper way. 
</P>
<P>
"Something that hasn't changed is the fact that sex is still the main recurring 
theme in my work. The subject fascinates me even more than it did when I was 18 
because it's acquired a depth it didn't have then. The collective myths that 
connote sexual ecstasy are deep things that have everything to do with the 
society you grow up in and the entire history of the human race. 
</P>
<P>
"In a way, my work is evolving in a way that's out of sync with the culture," 
he adds. "You could get away with a lot more in the early '70s, when people 
were interested in experimental, sexually crazy stuff. People are afraid of 
those things now, and most people don't like the work I do now nearly as much 
as the stuff from the late '60s, when my work contained the optimism of that 
time. I'm not so alienated from the culture that my work doesn't reflect the 
collective consciousness of the period, and many people find the work I'm doing 
now extremely dark. 
</P>
<P>
"But I never worry about how the work will be received because I'm not 
interested in a mainstream audience. I don't want to be the guy who caters to 
people and makes them feel comfortable about their lives -- not that I sit down 
to draw and think 'now let's see how uncomfortable I can make people.' But I've 
found that if you do something that's straight from where you live, it's not 
gonna be mainstream. It just doesn't work that way. My work is full of 
sweating, nervous uneasiness, which is a big part of me and everybody else. 
Most people don't want to see that though because it reminds them of inadequate 
parts of themselves."

COSTA-GAVRAS' FILMS: A SPECIAL KIND OF THRILL; 
</P>
<P>
THE DIRECTOR'S WORKS ARE MARKED BY HIS NOTIONS OF CIVIC DUTY AND PATRIOTISM

<P>
Costa-Gavras makes thrillers, and perhaps his success lies in giving this 
hard-bitten action-packed form the urgency of an SOS cry of distress. 
</P>
<P>
"Between the Greek tragedy in which I was born and the Hollywood film on which 
I was nourished, the thriller is natural to me," Costa-Gavras said in the Paris 
studio where he is editing his new film, "Music Box." His definition of the 
term is wide: "The Grapes of Wrath" is a thriller, he says, if not in 
conventional terms. 
</P>
<P>
"Music Box," which he is editing here after shooting in Chicago and Budapest, 
develops the theme of private responsibility within the framework of a story 
about a young woman lawyer's defense of her father, an Illinois steel worker 
accused of war crimes in his native Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Jessica Lange plays the daughter, with the German actor Armin Mueller-Stahl as 
her devoted father who raised the girl after her mother's death. In her 
courtroom defense the daughter manages to weaken much of the evidence more on 
form than on content, Costa-Gavras said, but she is increasingly stricken by 
doubt: "It is a little the tragedy of a girl who comes to know her father and 
must take a stand." 
</P>
<P>
A Carolco presentation of an Irwin Winkler production, "Music Box" is scheduled 
for release by Tri-Star Pictures in December. The script, by Joe Esterhas, is 
in part based on the recent case of John Demjanjuk, the Ukrainian-born Ohio 
automobile plant worker sentenced to death for his crimes in the Treblinka 
extermination camp. Costa-Gavras, who does intensive research to inform himself 
as well as to defend his films after release, said he came to "Music Box" 
thinking its story would be remote to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I read Allan M. Ryan's 'Quiet Neighbors,' which is overwhelming. After 
the war, 10,000 war criminals managed to get to the U.S., an extraordinary 
number." 
</P>
<P>
The thriller element in "Music Box" is less in tracking down the evidence than 
in exploring the relationship between father and daughter. "It is a thriller in 
the sense that it is the daughter's discovery of her father. It is something 
that on a different level can happen all the time. We don't really know our 
parents' lives, we cannot imagine them making love, we see them more as images 
than as human beings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is an element of the thriller in all human relations. The 
thriller is the curiosity we have in life. I remember in Greece I had a teacher 
who used to say that the difference between animals and men is that if he is in 
a valley, a man will always try to see what is on the other side of the 
mountain, while the animal will stay where he is. The thriller is that." 
</P>
<P>
His first film, "Sleeping Car Murders," was a simple whodunit. But then 
Costa-Gavras moved on to the political thriller with a vengeance. Along came 
the Academy Award winning "Z" about the Greece of the colonels, "The 
Confession," set in Stalinist Czechoslovakia, "State of Siege," set in Uraguay, 
"Special Section," about Vichy France, and "Missing," set in Pinochet's Chile. 
</P>
<P>
"Missing," with Jack Lemmon, was Costa-Gavras' first American film. While 
deeply political, it could more handily be called a moral thriller, like last 
year's controversial "Betrayed," about neo-fascism in the American heartland. 
The film starring Debra Winger and Tom Berringer drew mostly mixed reviews and 
generated only modest income at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
A naturalized French citizen, Costa-Gavras came to Paris as a film student and 
worked as an assistant to Rene Clair, Rene Clement, Marcel Ophuls and Jacques 
Demy. Thanks to Simone Signoret and Yves Montand, he was able to make "Sleeping 
Car Murders" and Montand later starred in "Z," "The Confession" and "State of 
Siege." 
</P>
<P>
What attracts him about working in the United States, he says, is not a big 
budget, which he neither wants nor needs, but more space for ideas. "I film as 
I do in 
</P>
<P>
France, but what I find in America is subjects I can handle in the way I want 
to handle them. In the U.S. a film can be a cry, in France one tends more to be 
wry or ironic. I think the U.S. corresponds more to my view." 
</P>
<P>
Viewed askance in some quarters for his leftist politics, Costa-Gavras says the 
United States "is like galaxy in which there are many suns and people of all 
sorts." His political views cannot be narrowly confined -- he praised the 
honest right-wing judge in "Z" and flayed the Communist regime in "The 
Confession" -- and he always lets his collaborators know his intentions. 
</P>
<P>
"I explain at the start what I plan to do, so everything is clear. On 'Music 
Box' I told it all to Jessica and to Irwin and at that point it is yes or no." 
</P>
<P>
Costa-Gavras said no some years back to an offer to direct "The Godfather," a 
decision he doesn't regret because he says he could not have done it as well as 
Francis Coppola did and because he did not know America well enough at the 
time. More important, he wasn't sure about the subject matter. "I had my doubts 
because it was a film about the Mafia that never (fully addressed the issue of) 
drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Just as the thriller attracts him not for its solution but for the questions it 
asks, so the wrongdoers who interest him are not in crime rings. "Organized 
crime is part of life, unfortunately. The important thing is legal crime 
because we choose our leaders. When evil people hold official positions like 
the colonels in 'Z,' they are much more responsible than ordinary criminals." 
</P>
<P>
The notions of civic duty and patriotism inform Costa-Gavras' films, making 
melodrama tragic. In "Betrayed" the Klu Klux Klan-member farmer says, "I just 
want the country I grew up in, that's all," and Costa-Gavras explores the 
resonances of such a phrase. "One's idea of one's country is like a flag," he 
says. "It can hide many things." 
</P>
<P>
In "Music Box" the point is less about war crimes than the traces they leave. 
"That's why I wanted to do the film, because of the relations of father and 
daughter and because it's a film about memory. It's much more about memory than 
punishment." 
</P>
<P>
His films may open eyes to frightful misdeeds, but he does not make them with a 
view to bringing about change, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I meet people who say your film changed my life, which is something it 
frightens me to hear. I think it should take more than that to change a 
person's life, or less. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want that responsibility. I make films as I feel them, with passion or 
aggressively or with candor. I never made one that I thought would cause a 
change."

For a brief moment, it was one man against an army. One individual who stood 
alone against a column of tanks. One citizen who, to many, stood for an entire 
nation of 1.1 billion Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
The man jumped on top of the lead tank and talked briefly to the soldiers 
before friends hauled him away to safety. 
</P>
<P>
Many were not so lucky. The People's Liberation Army turned its guns on them in 
a simultaneous display of the brute physical strength and the unmistakable 
political weakness of China's rulers. 
</P>
<P>
For centuries before Christ, a succession of emperors had ruled China with the 
power of the sword. Deng Xiaoping had appeared willing to try a new way. For 
the better part of a decade, the 84-year-old Deng, China's supreme leader, had 
permitted a measure of economic freedom. 
</P>
<P>
For many Chinese students, that was not enough. They massed in Tian An Men 
Square in central Beijing, chanting slogans for democracy, demanding a free 
press, erecting an imitation Statue of Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
This was more than Deng and the octogenarian leaders of the Communist Party 
were willing to permit. 
</P>
<P>
During the night of Saturday, June 3, troops moved toward the center of 
Beijing. In the ensuing clashes, hundreds of people were killed, perhaps 
thousands. At 7:40 a.m. on Sunday, a government loudspeaker announced to an 
empty, bloodstained square: "Rebellion has been suppressed, and the soldiers 
are now in charge of Tian An Men." 
</P>
<P>
But the shock waves from the Chinese demonstrations will reverberate for years 
both inside China and throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
For many in China, the spring of 1989 shattered whatever faith they retained in 
the ruling Communist Party and its leaders. 
</P>
<P>
And around the globe, millions became moral supporters of the demonstrators, 
glorying in their triumphs and grieving in their ultimate suppression. 
</P>
<P>
What follows is an account of what, for now, remains a shattered dream.

Deng Xiaoping, 84, China's paramount leader, is presumed to have ordered June 
3-4 military assault that ended the pro-democracy protests in Beijing. Deng 
holds only one high-ranking position -- chairman of Central Military Commission 
of ruling Communist Party. Commission, not Defense Ministry, has final say on 
military matters, and that plus his personal ties to top generals gives Deng 
control of People's Liberation Army. Veteran of epic Long March of 1930s, Deng 
became general secretary of party but was purged twice by radicals during 
1966-76 Cultural Revolution and then staged comeback that transformed China 
from country dominated by ideological battles into one with pragmatic, 
market-oriented economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
Deng was out of public view during Beijing massacre but reappeared June 9 to 
congratulate military leaders for putting down "rioting." He also said that 
economic reforms will continue. Name pronounced: Dung Sheeow-ping. 
</P>
<P>
Zhao Ziyang, 70, apparently purged in May for sympathizing with student 
protesters, has been general secretary of Communist Party since 1987 and 
nation's leading advocate of rapid economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
As governor of Sichuan province in late 1970s, he led country in successful 
experiments in restoring family farming. Deng brought him to Beijing in 1980, 
and he was quickly named premier. He became party chief in 1987 after ouster of 
fellow reformist Hu Yaobang, who was blamed for failing to deal with student 
unrest. 
</P>
<P>
Zhao was last seen in public May 19 when he went to Tian An Men Square to meet 
student hunger strikers. Martial law was imposed in most of Beijing next day. 
There have been no official reports of his whereabouts, and he is said to be 
under house arrest. Name pronounced: Jow Dz-yawng. 
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, 60, who declared martial law in Beijing on May 20, has been premier 
since April, 1988. Li studied in Soviet Union in 1950s and represents 
technocrats now filling many government offices. He opposed scope of Zhao's 
moves in market-oriented reforms, saying he supports plan but prefers more 
cautious pace. 
</P>
<P>
Li briefly met student protesters in testy televised exchange just before 
martial law was imposed. He was out of public view during army's bloody assault 
on Tian An Men Square, then reappeared June 8 to thank troops for job well 
done. In later appearance, he delivered hard-line speech promising further 
steps to restore order and suppress "counterrevolutionary rebels." Name 
pronounced: Lee Pung. 
</P>
<P>
Yang Shangkun, 82, who supported Li's declaration of martial law and led 
hard-liners demanding tough stand against students, became China's president, 
or head of state, in April, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Post of president is largely ceremonial, but Yang has close ties to Deng and 
holds seat on 17-member party Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
Career military man, veteran of Long March who was active in Red Army campaigns 
in 1930s and 1940s, Yang was appointed permanent vice chairman of Central 
Military Commission in 1982. Yang's power in that post reportedly has grown, 
and some say he has been running commission. 
</P>
<P>
More important, Yang has family connections in military hierarchy, particularly 
in 27th Army that spearheaded assault in Beijing. Name pronounced: Yawng 
Shawng-kwun. 
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, 64, oversees China's secret police and intelligence operations, as 
well as courts, by virtue of being head of Communist Party's Political and 
Legal Commission. He also heads party's Discipline Inspection Commission, 
responsible for punishing errant members. In his most visible post, Qiao holds 
key position on powerful five-member Standing Committee of Communist Party 
Politburo. Observers see him as likely successor to Zhao Ziyang as Communist 
Party chief. 
</P>
<P>
Qiao was born in 1924 in Zhejiang province and joined Communist Party at age 
16, serving as secretary of student committee in party's underground 
organization in Shanghai in 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
Disappeared during Cultural Revolution but resurfaced as deputy director of 
party's international liaison department, dealing with foreign Communist 
parties. Qiao was promoted to Central Committee and party Secretariat in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Qiao rarely speaks in public and is seen by analysts as more of an organization 
man than an innovator. A nonsmoker and nondrinker, Qiao gets up before dawn, 
jogs and walks for nearly an hour, before starting his 10-hour day. Name 
pronounced: Cheeow Sher.

"Before the banquet, without consulting with the Chinese side, the U.S. side 
sent an invitation ... to a certain individual unacceptable to the Chinese 
side." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chinese Foreign Ministry 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A few weeks before New Year's, on Jan. 6, the phone rang at Perry Link's 
apartment in Beijing's Friendship Hotel. It was Fang Lizhi on the line. They 
had met the previous September and had seen each other a few times since. Fang 
had enlisted Link's help in an unsuccessful effort to persuade Chinese 
authorities to let him travel to the United States for a scientific conference. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you come over?" Fang asked the American professor. 
</P>
<P>
Link hopped on his bicycle and rode the short distance to Fang's apartment 
building in the Haidian district of northwestern Beijing. From Fang's 
11th-floor apartment, he could see the usual midwinter smog settling over the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Link sat down, and Fang tossed a letter into his lap. "Look," said Fang. "I 
wrote this letter to Deng Xiaoping." 
</P>
<P>
Link scanned the letter. Fang was proposing that Deng use the coming 
anniversaries of the founding of the People's Republic or of the nationalistic 
protests of 1919 "to announce a general amnesty within China, and in particular 
to release Wei Jingsheng and all other political prisoners." Such an action, 
Fang wrote, "would be a humanitarian gesture and would have a beneficial effect 
on our social morale." 
</P>
<P>
Wei, leader of the Democracy Wall movement of the late 1970s, had been in 
prison for a decade. In December, 1978, Wei, then a 29-year-old electrician, 
published an essay called "The Fifth Modernization," arguing that China needed 
political democracy along with economic modernization. The following year, he 
was arrested and convicted at a closed trial of conducting 
"counterrevolutionary propaganda and agitation." He was sentenced to 15 years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such cases, China's official position is that the country has no 
political prisoners. Wei, and others like him, are classified as 
"counterrevolutionaries" -- and therefore criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Link put Fang's letter down. "What do you want me to do with this?" 
</P>
<P>
"Do whatever you want," replied Fang. 
</P>
<P>
Fang put a regular eight-cent stamp on the letter and mailed it to Deng, who 
did not reply. Link, meanwhile, took a copy back to the Friendship Hotel, 
translated it into English, called several reporters and gave them copies. 
</P>
<P>
The letter was quickly published in Chinese newspapers in Hong Kong, the United 
States and throughout the world. By February, intellectuals inside China were 
organizing petitions in support of Fang's letter. 
</P>
<P>
Fang Lizhi is a chubby, somewhat awkward man who wears the emblematic 
black-rimmed glasses of a Chinese intellectual. Three years ago he was an 
obscure figure, his name recognizable to only a few Chinese and almost no 
foreigners. He was a Communist Party member and a scientist, although, like 
many intellectuals, he had spent two years in the Chinese countryside during 
the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, working on railways and mining coal. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1986, while serving as vice president of the University of Science and 
Technology in Hefei, Fang had encouraged some of his students to demand more 
open elections to the local legislature after Communist Party officials had 
tried to include only their own candidates on ballot lists. Student 
demonstrations in Hefei spread to several other cities, including Shanghai, 
where tens of thousands of students had taken to the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Fang's actions angered the party leaders, including Deng. The following month, 
Fang was expelled both from his university job and from the Communist Party. 
But he was not jailed or exiled -- and he was not silenced. 
</P>
<P>
In the two years since his expulsion from the party, Fang gradually sharpened 
and honed his attacks on China's leadership. Marxism, he said, is "like a worn 
dress that must be put aside." Moreover, he said, the Chinese Communist Party 
"has achieved nothing of value during the past 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
Last winter, Fang took things a step further and began denouncing corruption by 
party leaders and their families. While on one trip to Australia last year, he 
publicly repeated rumors that many Chinese leaders and their families 
maintained foreign bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 20, a cool, cloudy day in the Washington area, President Bush assembled 
with his top foreign policy advisers and a group of Asia scholars at Camp 
David, Md. They were making plans for Bush's first overseas trip as President, 
a visit to Asia with the primary stop being Tokyo for the funeral of Japanese 
Emperor Hirohito. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle sat in on the talks. So did 
Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser, and Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III. 
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, the scholars discussed the question of how Bush should raise 
human rights issues on his trip to China. And, outside the meeting, they 
discovered that he had decided to do something that neither he nor any other 
American President, vice president or Cabinet secretary had ever done. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was planning to invite a small group of Chinese dissidents to a dinner he 
planned to host for Chinese leaders in Beijing. Among the dissidents to be 
invited would be Fang Lizhi. Since the Richard M. Nixon Administration's 
opening to China in 1972, no senior U.S. official had met with or recognized 
any sort of domestic opposition to the Chinese Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's invitation to the dissidents was a momentous decision -- yet not, from 
an American point of view, a particularly surprising one. 
</P>
<P>
Former Secretary of State George P. Shultz had repeatedly met with Soviet 
dissidents. And the previous summer, during a trip to Moscow, President Ronald 
Reagan had invited a large group of dissidents to the U.S. Embassy. Reagan's 
meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev had proceeded without any major 
disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
If the Soviet Union could tolerate American recognition of its dissidents, then 
couldn't China? After all, China had launched its reform program well before 
the Soviets, and it had enjoyed much closer relations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration may have had other reasons for extending the 
invitation. By all indications, the CIA in 1988 was giving U.S. policy-makers 
much more pessimistic reports about the state of China's economic reforms and 
the popularity of Deng Xiaoping's regime than at any previous time over the 
past decade. 
</P>
<P>
By inviting Fang and other dissidents to dinner, the Bush Administration was 
hedging its bets, sending out a signal that its relationship with China did not 
rest exclusively on its ties to the senior leadership. The United States was, 
in effect, officially acknowledging the existence of China's small but growing 
democracy movement and, more broadly, the extent of popular dissatisfaction 
with the Chinese leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to make a statement, but to do so in a way that was not 
confrontational to the Chinese leaders," explained one U.S. official. 
Administration officials realized there was "some risk" that the invitation 
might anger Chinese leaders, but they decided to take the risk. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the Camp David meeting, a special messenger sent by the U.S. 
Embassy in Beijing arrived at Fang's apartment to deliver banquet invitations 
to Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian. Other dissidents invited by the White House 
included Marxist theoretician Su Shaozhi, playwright Wu Zuguang and political 
scientist Yan Jiaqi. 
</P>
<P>
The invitations, no matter how small a step they might have seemed to the 
United States, represented a dramatic break in U.S. policy toward Beijing. And 
that is exactly how they were perceived in China, both by the top leaders and 
by the dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leadership accepted with relative equanimity the invitations to Su, 
Wu and Yan. But the morning after the Camp David planning session, when The Los 
Angeles Times broke the news of Fang's invitation, Chinese officials reacted 
with fury. "Deng and (Chinese President) Yang Shangkun were especially 
outraged," said an American diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
For five days, while Bush traveled from Washington to Tokyo to Beijing, Chinese 
officials tried to persuade Washington to withdraw the invitation to Fang. The 
United States refused. 
</P>
<P>
After Bush arrived in Beijing, Chinese officials announced that Yang and 
Premier Li Peng might not attend the President's dinner unless he withdrew the 
invitation to Fang. U.S. officials again refused, although they agreed to a 
compromise in which Bush would not move from table to table at the banquet and 
thus would not clink glasses with Fang. That concession seemed to mollify Yang 
and Li, who agreed to attend Bush's dinner. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of Sunday, Feb. 26, Link and his wife attempted to escort Fang and 
his wife to the banquet at the Great Wall Hotel in northeastern Beijing. Link 
had arranged for a car, a white Nissan, with a driver. Fang was wearing a 
Western suit and Li an evening dress. 
</P>
<P>
They never made it. About 700 yards from the hotel, Chinese authorities had set 
up a barricade to clear all guests for the banquet. The other dissidents were 
allowed to pass. But when the car carrying Fang arrived, police told the driver 
to pull over. When he parked, they were surrounded by men whom they believed to 
be plainclothes police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Fang, holding his invitation, was told he was not on the official guest list. 
And over the next two hours, police blocked his repeated efforts to reach the 
banquet. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the banquet proceeded on schedule. Bush and President Yang delivered 
the customary toasts to one another. 
</P>
<P>
"We went through the banquet thinking Fang was there," said one State 
Department official. "It was only afterward that we found out he wasn't there." 
</P>
<P>
Later that night Fang appeared at the Shangri-la Hotel, where the American 
press corps was staying, and recounted, in a series of television interviews 
broadcast around the world, how Chinese police had blocked him from attending 
the dinner to which he had been invited. It was a remarkable demonstration of 
how sensitive Chinese leaders were on the subject of political dissent and of 
the extent to which they would go to avoid confronting it. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Bush and other White House officials tried to play down the affair's 
importance. But the American invitation to Fang, and the Chinese reaction to 
it, had been an important episode, one that helped set the stage for the more 
dramatic events of the spring. 
</P>
<P>
To Chinese students, the American invitation to Fang was encouraging. It showed 
that at the highest levels of the U.S. government, there was interest in and 
recognition of the cause of democracy in China. 
</P>
<P>
To leaders such as Deng and Yang, the episode served as a warning. Dissidents 
like Fang, and their campaign for democratic reforms and human rights, could 
pose a threat to the Communist Party's power.

"This incident has impelled us to think over the future as well as the past 
sober-mindedly." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Deng Xiaoping 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early on the morning of Sunday, June 4, an American correspondent walked out of 
Beijing's railway station after an overnight train trip from Shanghai to find 
an unexpected scene: There were no buses, no taxis, none of the usual bustle of 
a Chinese railway station. He noticed the faint smell of smoke and cordite in 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
When he asked a pedicab operator to drive him less than half a mile, the driver 
demanded 100 yuan ($27), an astronomical sum for China, more than 10 times the 
usual fee. He asked why. 
</P>
<P>
"They killed a lot of people," the driver explained. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning after the massacre, Beijing was a city under military occupation 
-- but not yet under military control. 
</P>
<P>
Troops, tanks and armored personnel carriers controlled the center of Beijing. 
The battle for the hallowed political turf of Tian An Men Square was over. But 
the People's Liberation Army was now forced to deal with the consequences of 
its bloody assault. 
</P>
<P>
Walking out of the Minzu Hotel that Sunday, Ralph Miller saw burned tanks, 
burned buses and burned people. Black columns of smoke rose from Tian An Men 
Square. Late in the day, the first time he was allowed past the troops and into 
the square, what Miller noticed most was the smell. Throughout Tian An Men 
Square, Miller could smell burning rubber, tear gas and burning flesh. The 
stench was awful. 
</P>
<P>
Shops and stores were closed. Most residents remained inside or clustered on 
streets near their homes to talk quietly in small groups. Contingents of troops 
patrolled the main streets, sometimes firing volleys from AK-47 automatic 
rifles to make sure their authority was recognized. 
</P>
<P>
In broad daylight, along the streets near Tian An Men Square, Chinese troops 
continued to shoot at unarmed civilians. In front of the Beijing Hotel that 
Sunday morning, troops fired four volleys at unarmed, youthful throngs. A 
foreign witness saw 50 people drop to the pavement, apparently wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Near Jianguomen, at the old eastern entrance to the city, a 65-year-old woman 
practicing tai ji quan exercises was struck by a bullet and killed. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Beijing were enraged. And, as the news gradually spread, residents 
of other cities were equally aroused. For the following week, the regime found 
itself with an urban population in a state of virtual insurrection. 
</P>
<P>
At Beijing University, students hung pictures on campus walls of those who had 
been killed. "A debt of blood has to be paid back in blood!" said one 
wallposter. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few days, some Beijing residents put up whatever resistance they 
could. They looked for abandoned military vehicles and stuffed burning cloth in 
their gas tanks. On June 5, along one thoroughfare, citizens managed to ignite 
eight armored personnel carriers. One contained ammunition, which exploded, 
crackling and booming for more than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
In the streets, citizens continued to put up roadblocks of buses, street 
dividers and market stalls. It was a symbolic gesture; the tanks easily burst 
through the barricades. 
</P>
<P>
It was clear that only outright terror could subdue the population of Beijing. 
Troops roamed the streets, firing into the air without reason or provocation. 
In some of the old neighborhoods near Tian An Men Square, soldiers ran into 
alleyways shooting at fleeing residents. 
</P>
<P>
For two days, the terror campaign was compounded by rumors and fears of civil 
war. Troops positioned themselves in defensive formations at strategic points 
around the capital, as if guarding against a possible attack by rival military 
forces. About 20 tanks stood guard at the Jianguomen Bridge on the east side of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign military attaches suggested that some PLA units, including the air 
force, might have been so infuriated by the brutality of the Saturday night 
assault that they would try to invade the city and reconquer it from its 
occupiers. 
</P>
<P>
The military could begin taking sides and become swept up in the continuing 
power struggle within China's political leadership, the experts said. 
Buttressing their speculation were several reports of skirmishes between army 
units inside and on the outskirts of Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
From Monday, June 5, through Wednesday, June 7, both inside Beijing and 
outside, convoys of troops and vehicles shuttled from position to position, as 
if maneuvering for battle. But the civil war never came. Despite the apparent 
divisions over the massacre, the People's Liberation Army held together. 
</P>
<P>
The news of the Beijing massacre brought the people of Shanghai into the 
streets by the hundreds of thousands. Students and workers together 
commandeered buses, deflating tires or sticking ice picks in them to block the 
city's narrow streets, which are nearly impassable even in the best of 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Workers attacked and set fire to a passenger train that had struck protesters 
blocking the track, killing six people. Factories were brought nearly to a 
standstill early in the week. City authorities suggested they were on the verge 
of declaring martial law and urged foreign consulates to keep their nationals 
away from such public areas as the Bund along the waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
In Chengdu, capital of the central province of Sichuan, at least 30 people were 
killed and 100 to 300 more were wounded when police, acting at about the same 
time as the PLA assault in Beijing, attacked protesters with truncheons, 
bayonets and guns. During the ensuing two days of unrest, crowds set fire to a 
market and movie theater and ransacked some vendors' stalls and two tourist 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all of the major cities in Manchuria, China's northeast, had serious 
disorders. In Changchun, half the workers struck the No. 1 Auto Factory, 
China's leading auto plant, in the days after the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
A young American who rode a train from Canton to Beijing in the two days after 
the massacre was delayed in several cities by political turmoil and student 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
At the train station in Changsha, capital of Hunan province -- where Mao 
Tse-tung once worked as a librarian, reading the works of Karl Marx -- nearly 
100 student demonstrators approached, chanting pro-democracy slogans and 
seeking to jump aboard the train to Beijing. At Wuhan, more students in the 
station tried to hop aboard, and train attendants ordered the riders to close 
their windows. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving Wuhan, the train came to a halt again. The railroad bridge across the 
Yangtze River, one of the most strategically important transportation links in 
China, had to be cleared of student protesters. 
</P>
<P>
When this American reached Beijing, he hopped on the city's subway line and got 
off at the Jianguomen stop. Walking outdoors, he saw smoke rising from 
burned-out army trucks. 
</P>
<P>
To complete its control of the population of Beijing, the martial-law 
authorities needed to scale back considerably on the number of foreigners in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every university in Beijing had foreign students. Many academic 
research institutes and news organizations had foreign experts or visitors. 
These foreigners could constitute troublesome networks of information and 
become inconvenient eyewitnesses for a security apparatus seeking to carry out 
arrests and purges. 
</P>
<P>
On June 4-5, Chinese troops had been patrolling and firing their weapons along 
main thoroughfares like Changan Avenue. At 1 p.m. June 5, the army trucks took 
a new route. A convoy swung by the residence of U.S. Ambassador James R. Lilley 
and the press and cultural section of the U.S. Embassy. There, the soldiers 
unloaded several volleys. 
</P>
<P>
"They're shooting right outside my office!" Andy Koss, the press spokesman for 
the U.S. Embassy, said in the midst of a phone interview. ". . . Oh, goddamn 
it! It's unbelievable. They've got guns ready -- they're shooting up in the 
air." 
</P>
<P>
That night, visitors to the Jianguo Hotel, one of the leading foreigners' 
hotels in Beijing, went in by a rear service entrance. There was army rifle 
fire on the street outside. 
</P>
<P>
On June 7, Chinese troops shot directly into two of the main housing complexes 
for foreign diplomats and journalists in Beijing. Bullets shattered windows. 
"They shot up every apartment in the building," said Fred Krug, chief of 
security for the U.S. Embassy. Krug's Chinese maid threw her body over his 
children to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly two hours, soldiers also surrounded one diplomatic complex and 
refused to let people leave. Chinese troops shot into the largest office 
building for foreign businesses in Beijing, shattering windows and leaving 
bullet holes and broken glass in the China-based headquarters of some of the 
largest corporations in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Foreigners were leaving Beijing as fast as jumbo jets could accommodate them. 
Many Western embassies reduced their staffs to essential personnel. Lilley 
urged Americans to leave China, and other ambassadors did likewise. 
</P>
<P>
"When the war is over, we will return to China," declared a 5-year-old boy 
named David, the son of a British diplomat, as he played with his Tommy the 
Tank toy on a Cathay Pacific flight from Beijing to Hong Kong. "And it will be 
nice and clean." 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, June 4, after the massacre, UCLA Prof. Perry Link visited Fang Lizhi 
and his wife, Li Shuxian. "They've gone crazy. They've gone berserk," Fang 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Link departed, but later that afternoon Li Shuxian phoned him. "Why don't you 
bring the children over to play?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
It was a code, and it meant Fang and Li wanted to see him immediately. This 
time, they told him they wanted to leave their apartment for good. They wanted 
to talk about seeking safety in the U.S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Fang and Li, accompanied by Link, met with several American 
officials at the U.S. Embassy. On the streets outside, they heard volleys of 
gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
The talks started at noon and went on for 5 1/2 hours. In a town stricken with 
a food shortage, their lunch was peanut butter and crackers. "Never mind," Link 
told the apologetic embassy officials. "That's a bigger meal than we got when 
President Bush was visiting." 
</P>
<P>
The embassy officials were full of caution. They raised three points for Fang 
to consider. 
</P>
<P>
First, the United States had never granted protection in the embassy to a 
Chinese national, and the embassy officials were uncertain of the impact. 
Second, it was impossible to predict how long Fang and Li would have to remain 
inside the embassy. And third, Fang's presence could give the Chinese 
government grounds to attack the democracy movement as linked with foreign 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
The third argument weighed heavily on Fang. Everyone in the room stared at him. 
Finally, he decided: He would not ask the Americans to protect him. 
</P>
<P>
Link, Fang and Li went to a well-stocked restaurant for a large Cantonese 
dinner, with scallops, tofu and shredded pork. They talked in general about 
China, but not about the embassy. Finally, Link left. 
</P>
<P>
Fang, choosing not to go to his apartment that night, made plans to sleep 
elsewhere. The next day, he apparently reconsidered his decision. On June 6, 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater announced in Washington that Fang and Li 
had taken refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials were infuriated. Five days later, they issued an arrest 
warrant for Fang and Li, charging them with "counterrevolutionary propaganda 
and instigation" in connection with the student demonstrations. The Chinese 
regime labeled Fang a "traitor," which is tantamount to a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping had not been seen in public since his summit meeting with Soviet 
President Gorbachev. Throughout the imposition of martial law, the massacre and 
its aftermath, Deng was variously rumored to be dead, dying, hospitalized or 
helpless. It was said that perhaps he was now under the influence of President 
Yang Shangkun, or that Yang had led a successful coup against him. 
</P>
<P>
But on June 9, six nights after the massacre, Deng reappeared on nationwide 
television, surrounded by elderly conservative allies in the Communist Party 
and a flock of army generals. He looked frail and drawn -- but animated. 
</P>
<P>
The People's Liberation Army, Deng said, "is always the defender of the state, 
the socialist system, and the people's interests. . . . (It is) the bastion of 
iron of the state." 
</P>
<P>
The army had crushed a "counterrevolutionary rebellion," Deng said. "This 
incident has impelled us to think over the future as well as the past 
sober-mindedly. It will enable us to carry forward our cause more steadily, 
better and even faster, and correct our mistakes faster." 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few days, the Chinese regime launched an intense propaganda 
campaign aimed at showing that the army, in its assault in Beijing, had merely 
responded to violent "thugs" and "rioters" with the minimum force necessary to 
put down the "rebellion." 
</P>
<P>
Chinese officials said that the original student protest movement and its 
comparatively reasonable demands were exploited by enemies of the state, some 
of them outside China, seeking to overthrow the socialist system and the 
authority of the Communist Party. This, they said, would have led to chaos in 
the world's most populous country, with grave implications for other nations. 
</P>
<P>
The armed troops that moved toward the square on June 3 to suppress the 
"counterrevolutionary rebellion" had orders not to fire their weapons, Chinese 
officials said, but were forced to shoot to defend themselves when they were 
attacked by people trying to stop them in the streets leading to the square. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests and purges began on the weekend of June 10. 
</P>
<P>
That Saturday night, a week after the massacre, Chinese television announced 
the arrests of more than 400 people in Beijing, along with additional arrests 
in other cities. Television news programs showed film of young men in custody 
who seemed to have been beaten. 
</P>
<P>
On June 13, Chinese police put out a nationwide dragnet for 21 student leaders 
involved in the demonstrations. Those who had led the largest nonviolent 
protests in modern Chinese history were accused, like Fang Lizhi, of inciting 
"counterrevolutionary rebellion." 
</P>
<P>
Wuer Kaixi, the student who had dared to talk so boldly to Li Peng on 
nationwide television, remained at large but was reduced to China's version of 
a most-wanted poster. 
</P>
<P>
"Wuer Kaixi . . . ," said the Chinese police in a nationally televised 
broadcast. "Male. Born Feb. 17, 1968. Uighur minority from Xinjiang autonomous 
region. Beijing Teachers University education department student. Height: 174 
centimeters. Big eyes. Thick lips. Fair skin. Often wears green military 
pants." 
</P>
<P>
The authorities dealt severely with those who were apprehended. On June 15, 
three men accused of torching a train during the demonstrations in Shanghai 
were sentenced to death. Two days later, eight people in Beijing were sentenced 
to die for resisting the army's assault on the city. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and several Western European nations pleaded for clemency for 
the condemned. White House spokesman Fitzwater issued a statement June 20 
declaring that carrying out the death sentences "could only deepen the wounds 
of the past few weeks." 
</P>
<P>
The appeals were to no avail. On Wednesday, June 21, only six days after their 
sentence was handed down, the three young men in Shanghai were executed, the 
first of more than two dozen protesters to be put to death around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Yuan Mu, a spokesman for China's State Council, or Cabinet, explained in a 
televised interview that the nation should expect the ferocious crackdown to 
continue. "In coming months," Yuan said, "a small number . . . of people of 
this kind will also be duly punished because of their heinous crimes."

"There is a law of history according to which as long as the old does not 
disappear, the new cannot come into existence. Now that the old is gone for 
good, everyone is scanning the horizon in the hope of seeing the emergence of 
the new." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wei Jingsheng, the now-imprisoned Chinese dissident, on Democracy Wall, 
Beijing, 1978 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Year of the Snake is less than half gone. After the convulsions of the 
spring, what will China's future bring? What will the leadership do? How will 
the people react? These are some of the possibilities: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1. Return to Normal 
</P>
<P>
Under this scenario, the Chinese regime, now controlled by the hard-liners, 
moves quickly to re-establish a sense of normalcy and restore much the same 
policies of moderate reform it was pursuing before the pro-democracy 
demonstrations. It keeps up its broad economic, cultural and political contacts 
with the West, while making clear that it is unwilling to tolerate any 
agitation for democracy. The leadership tones down its rhetoric and eases up on 
the purges. Zhao Ziyang, although dropped as Communist Party general secretary, 
is allowed to keep a seat in the Politburo or Central Committee. The 
leadership, having drawn the limits of dissent, seeks to resist and ignore the 
outpouring of revulsion over the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
Early signs are that some elements of the leadership would like to try this 
approach. Deng Xiaoping, in his reappearance on nationwide television, said 
China's economic reforms and opening to the outside world will continue. 
Foreign businessmen who fled China are being encouraged to return. Some 
reform-minded Chinese officials allied with Zhao have re-emerged, seemingly in 
good graces with the hard-liners now in command of the government. 
</P>
<P>
But China's leaders will face difficulties if they try to conduct business as 
usual. 
</P>
<P>
This approach was tried without success on comparable occasions over the past 
decade. A few weeks after launching a campaign against "spiritual pollution" in 
1983, and again a few months after Hu Yaobang was ousted from power in 1987, 
the regime let up and continued reforming the economy and seeking openings to 
the outside. The result was further absorption of Western ideas, and further 
agitation by Chinese intellectuals and students for political change. The 
hard-liners now must realize that to stamp out "bourgeois liberalization," they 
would have to limit contacts between China and the West. They might not 
willingly ease up again. 
</P>
<P>
And millions of people in China and abroad will remember this spring's events. 
They will not be prepared to cooperate with the Chinese regime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2. Hardening the Hard Line 
</P>
<P>
China's leadership, according to this scenario, not only holds onto power but 
hardens its policies at home and abroad. It vigorously pursues the current 
purges and seeks to install its own loyal cadres throughout Chinese work units 
and organizations. Zhao is not only ousted from his job but purged from the 
party, denounced as a counterrevolutionary and possibly imprisoned. Free-market 
economic reforms are halted or cut back because they allow too many Chinese too 
much independence from party control. To prevent further "spiritual 
contamination" of Chinese youth by Western politics and culture, Beijing 
sharply restricts contacts between China and the West. The regime attempts to 
rely on its own resources once again, as in the days when Mao pursued Chinese 
"self-sufficiency." 
</P>
<P>
Increased toughness would seem to appeal most to the octogenarian, Long March 
generation of the party, to officials who fear loss of their privileges and to 
China's large security apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
However, the regime would have to spend enormous resources and energy, and it 
would encounter considerable resistance. It would require great effort by 
security forces to purge all reform-minded officials and to rid campuses of all 
the pro-democracy students. Disaffected workers and intellectuals could be 
expected to be less productive, and Chinese overseas would probably seek to 
undermine the Beijing leadership. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3. The Reformers Return 
</P>
<P>
This scenario rests on a dramatic political change in China, with reformers, 
possibly headed by Zhao, regaining control of the Communist Party. They 
acknowledge that the student movement of 1989 was patriotic in nature and blame 
the political leaders who called in the army, not the troops who carried out 
their orders. China's media are granted the sort of freedom they enjoyed at the 
height of the student demonstrations. The leadership adopts new political 
reforms, perhaps modeled after those instituted by Gorbachev in the Soviet 
Union, opening the way for some form of institutionalized dissent. The new 
regime opens the way for much broader economic and cultural ties with the West. 
</P>
<P>
Farfetched as the "reversal" scenario sounds, there are some historical 
precedents. The closest one is October, 1976, a month after Mao's death, when a 
group of military and security officials connived to arrest Mao's widow and the 
"Gang of Four," in effect ending the Cultural Revolution and paving the way for 
Deng's eventual return to power. 
</P>
<P>
If China's economy deteriorates, the "reversal" scenario is at least 
conceivable. Military leaders could intervene and install reformers at the top 
ranks of the party. As long as Zhao remains alive, he will serve as a symbol 
for alternative policies -- for further market reforms, for conciliation with 
students and intellectuals, for some degree of political change. For years, 
even while in exile, Deng represented a rival school of thought to Mao's in the 
Communist Party, a belief in the science and technology that Mao scorned. Now, 
even in exile, Zhao could similarly come to represent a rival school of thought 
to Deng, a believer in the sort of political power-sharing that Deng refuses to 
accept. 
</P>
<P>
But Deng and his hard-line allies have much stronger ties to the army than do 
Zhao and the reformers. It is hard to imagine China's military leaders moving 
to oust the party elders with whom they have enjoyed close links for years. And 
if they did, army leaders would have to deal with the explosive question of 
blame for the spring massacre. It would take time for the "reversal" scenario 
to become possible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
4. Chaos 
</P>
<P>
Under the final scenario, and the least likely, rival leaders or factions in 
the Communist Party and the army struggle for power. China divides into 
separate, virtually self-governing provinces or regions. The prosperous regions 
of China's southeastern coastline -- such as Guangdong province, the area 
around Canton -- seek greater autonomy to pursue their own independent 
free-market, export-oriented economic policies. Peasants, angered at the 
regime's inability to pay for their harvests, launch some new form of peasant 
rebellion. Workers, angered by continuing inflation and low wages, stage a 
crippling series of strikes. A newly emboldened group of students manages to 
stage nationwide demonstrations, and this time the army is so divided over what 
to do that civil war breaks out. 
</P>
<P>
It is commonplace to say that China's political future depends upon how long 
Deng lives. His death will be a landmark event, touching off new struggles for 
control of the Communist Party and the military and, perhaps, even a new round 
of pro-democracy demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the maneuvering over China's future is not waiting for Deng's death. It has 
been under way for several years. Senior leaders of the party and the military 
were unprepared to accept Hu Yaobang as Deng's successor; this spring, they 
made it clear that they were equally unwilling to let Zhao take over. Both Hu 
and Zhao, the party elders felt, had strayed too far from the party's 
traditions. When students, joined by workers and ordinary people, demanded 
political change, the party elders were willing to use massive force to 
suppress them. 
</P>
<P>
And their dream was shattered.

GIRLS DREAM OF FAST TRACK TO STARDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a long way from the grit and grime of a low-income west Oakland housing 
complex to the well-manicured campus of UC Irvine, but for two Oakland girls 
the trip represents the latest challenge in their quest to become future track 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
The girls, Nakail Sowell, 13, and Reyna Goodwin, 12, are members of the 
Oakland-based Acorn Track Club, which is competing this weekend in the West 
Coast Classic at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
The meet, sponsored by the Athletic Congress, features track teams of young 
people from all over the West Coast, and Sowell and Goodwin are two of its 
brightest stars. 
</P>
<P>
Both girls are national and state champions in their events and both hope to 
compete in the Olympic Games one day. 
</P>
<P>
"To be the next Olympic champion in the triple jump, that's my goal," Sowell 
said. "Also, maybe the 200 meters and the 400 meters. I know I'm gonna make 
it." 
</P>
<P>
If the girls do go on to become Olympic champions, a large share of the credit 
will go to their coach, Darrell Hampton, who formed the Acorn Track club four 
years ago to provide kids in the drug- and crime-plagued Acorn housing complex 
an alternative to street life. 
</P>
<P>
"Realistically, many of these kids, because of their circumstances, wouldn't be 
able to do the kinds of things that we are able to do in the club," Hampton 
said. "And ask any of them and they will tell you they want to go to college. 
This is a way out for them." 
</P>
<P>
Hampton's key goals are to take the boys and girls out of the inner-city 
environment in which they live as often as possible, and to reinforce the idea 
that hard work and determination will allow them to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
For Hampton, who is recreation director at the 673-unit Acorn apartment 
complex, it was not easy to gain their trust. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't know me, and I wasn't from their background, so I had to build 
rapport with them," he said. "For the first four or five months, it was really 
rough." 
</P>
<P>
Now, many parents support the team and travel with it. And established runners 
like Reyna and Nikail are role models for younger team members and other 
children in the housing project. 
</P>
<P>
The team "has really helped me to grow up and develop, and it feels great to 
have other kids look up to me," said Goodwin, who specializes in the 4x400 
meter relay, the 4x100 meter relay and the 200- and 400-meter runs. 
</P>
<P>
The Acorn team is one of two representing low-income housing projects that 
belong to the Athletic Congress, the sponsoring organization for all track and 
field events in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
After the Irvine meet, the team will compete in the California State Games in 
San Diego in August and then will travel to the Bahamas for an international 
meet.

3 MORE ROADWAYS MAY BE IMPROVED AS 'SUPER STREETS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With Beach Boulevard already being redesigned as a streamlined "super street," 
the Orange County Transportation Commission on Monday will consider choosing 
Katella Avenue, Imperial Highway and the 21-mile Moulton Parkway corridor as 
the next three super-street projects. 
</P>
<P>
Super streets are major thoroughfares upgraded with synchronized signals, bus 
turnouts, dual left-turn-lane pockets, fewer driveways, no on-street parking if 
feasible, and in some cases elevated ramps called "flyovers" that carry through 
traffic over congested intersections. 
</P>
<P>
However, commission officials said last week that when design studies are 
completed, there may be enough money available for construction work on only 
one of the streets, pitting cities against each other for the right to have a 
super-street project. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the commission was scheduled to choose only two new super-street 
projects, but commission member Clarice A. Blamer, a Brea councilwoman, helped 
persuade officials to keep Imperial Highway on the list because all three 
streets scored high in technical rankings. 
</P>
<P>
"Yorba Linda is very interested in improving Imperial Highway because north 
county has a terrible traffic problem and it is parallel to the Riverside 
Freeway, which also has horrendous traffic," Blamer said. 
</P>
<P>
There are 21 streets on OCTC's list of potential super-street projects, but 
nearly all depend on the future availability of construction funds. 
</P>
<P>
The commission has about $7.5 million earmarked for super-street improvements. 
Cost estimates for the three proposed super streets to be considered at 
Monday's meeting are still pending. 
</P>
<P>
The three projects are: 
</P>
<P>
* Katella Avenue -- 14 miles from the San Gabriel River Freeway in Los Alamitos 
to the Costa Mesa Freeway in Orange. Average daily use: 448,000 cars. 
</P>
<P>
* Imperial Highway -- 11 miles from Beach Boulevard in La Habra to the 
Riverside Freeway in Anaheim. Average daily use: 399,300 cars. 
</P>
<P>
* Moulton Parkway -- 21 miles that include a tiny segment of Edinger Avenue at 
the Costa Mesa Freeway in Santa Ana and eventually end at Coast Highway in Dana 
Point, via Irvine Center Drive and Street of the Golden Lantern. Average daily 
use: 462,000 cars. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Mountford, the commission's special projects manager, said special "flyover" 
ramps are contemplated for Moulton Parkway where it crosses El Toro Road. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for such ramps on Beach Boulevard have been abandoned because of stiff 
opposition from some cities and businesses along the route. 
</P>
<P>
The redesign of Beach Boulevard is scheduled for completion early next year, 
Mountford said. Construction is expected to begin several months later. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of other super-street projects will not start until 1992, he said.

Map, CURRENT AND PROPOSED SUPER STREETS Orange County Transportation Commission 
on Monday will consider approving the following "super streets." Design work is 
already under way to transform Beach Blvd. Under design: 1. Beach Blvd. between 
Ellis Ave. in Huntington Beach and Rosecrans Ave. in Buena Park. Under 
consideration: 2. Katella Ave. between I-605 and Costa Mesa Fwy. (55). 3. 
Imperial Highway between Beach Blvd. and Riverside Fwy. (91). 4. Edinger-Irvine

SEWAGE KEEPS BEACH CLOSED FOR 3RD DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aliso Beach County Park remained closed to sunbathers and surfers for the third 
straight day Saturday because of a sewer line break that sent 900,000 gallons 
of raw sewage into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards at the beach along Pacific Coast Highway in south Laguna Beach spent 
Saturday turning away weekend visitors to make sure no one entered the water or 
used the picnicking area near Aliso Creek. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Dunbar, assistant manager and chief engineer for the South Coast Water 
District, said he expected the beach to reopen by the July 4 weekend and that 
recent heavy surf should speed the natural dissolution of the sewage in the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Aliso Beach, the adjacent beach areas of Treasure Island and 
Table Rock also remained closed, although officials said the two areas may 
reopen earlier than Aliso. 
</P>
<P>
The spill, the third in the area this year, came Thursday morning when an older 
pipeline ruptured and sent the sewage spilling into Aliso Creek, which flows 
into the ocean at the popular beach just north of Aliso Pier.

ARGUMENT LEADS TO FATAL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One Santa Ana man was killed and a second was wounded early Saturday when an 
argument over a hat led to a shooting on West 3rd Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana Police Sgt. Bob Clark said Alfonso O. Rodriguez, 19, was fatally shot 
and Abel Vergara, 28, was wounded in the arm as several men chased them down 
the street and shot at them. Vergara was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange, 
where he was listed in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
Vergara told police, Clark said, that he and Rodriguez had taken another man's 
hat and that the shooting occurred as they were walking in the 1100 block of 
West 3rd. The two men were residents of West Third, Clark said. The shooting 
was not believed to be gang-related, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said an investigation had begun but that no suspects had been 
identified.

EVEN THE LITTLE THINGS MEAN A LOT FOR THE BUCKS OF BEND, ORE., WHERE SUCCESS 
REQUIRES BEING READY FOR ANYTHING AND KEEPING THE PARK PACKED

BEND, Ore. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten hours and five aspirins later, Jack Cain plopped down in an office chair 
and rubbed his aching feet. All things considered, the Bend Bucks' home opener 
was a smashing success. Hey, it didn't rain, the opposing team showed up and no 
one tried to de-antler Bucky Buck, the team mascot. It's the little things that 
keep a minor league baseball owner happy. 
</P>
<P>
OK, let's clear this up first. You can't technically call Jack the owner this 
year, even though he pays the bills and does everything around the stadium but 
park cars. Jack also is president of the Northwest League and is trying to 
avoid a conflict of interest. So he has signed over title to his wife, Mary. 
The Cains have owned the Bucks since 1981 and run the operation with a 
combination of elbow grease and offsprings. 
</P>
<P>
This is as Mom and Pop as it gets these days among minor leagues teams, which, 
like almost everything else, are being gobbled up by multi-partner corporate 
ownerships. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks were the Philadelphia Phillies' Class-A affiliate until 1986, when 
they pulled out and left one Buck out of luck. Don't get Jack started about the 
Phillies. He likens the parting to a divorce. If they wanted to move their farm 
team east to be closer to home, fine. But he'd rather not talk about it, even 
though it forced the Bucks to play as an independent in 1987, which meant 
combing the countryside for players to fill the roster. You 
</P>
<P>
ever try combing for a baseball team? 
</P>
<P>
Thankfully, the Bucks latched onto the Angels last season, and now all is well. 
They provide the players, God provides the weather and Jack Cain provides the 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
It's 9:51 p.m., Sunday, June 18, and a weary Jack Cain couldn't walk another 
step. He smiles and reaches for a piece of cold pizza. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the smoothest opener we've ever had," he said. "Don't ask me why. Our 
first opening day we ran out of beer in the third inning. You learn from your 
mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks, by the way, were clobbered, 11-4, by the South Oregon Athletics, but 
winning is secondary when rosters turn over faster than fast-food employees and 
you have no control over personnel. The crowd was a clean 2,029, meaning it 
wasn't padded by some nutty promotion like Luggage Night, where everyone brings 
a packed suitcase to the game hoping to win a trip to, say, Las Vegas. The 
catch is having to leave directly from the game. 
</P>
<P>
Which leads to another one of Jack Cain's biggest problems -- keeping people in 
town. Bend is gorgeous enough, nestled in the central Oregon high desert and 
surrounded by deep-blue skies and snow-capped mountains. But in baseball terms, 
Bend is the end. You approach it with the same attitude as you would robbing a 
liquor store -- hit quick and get out fast. 
</P>
<P>
The four returning players from last year's team don't want to be here. It's 
like being held back a year in grammar school. Everyone's looking to get out. 
Bob Hards, the team's general manager and play-by-play announcer, wants to be 
Vin Scully. Don Long, the Bucks' 27-year-old manager, wants to be Doug Rader. 
Even Bucky Buck is tired of doing pratfalls and waiting for the echo off Mt. 
Bachelor. His question: If a mascot falls in the middle of the forest, does 
anyone hear it? Bucky Buck's goal is to be the next San Diego Chicken. Really. 
</P>
<P>
An open diary of opening day: 
</P>
<P>
2 p.m. -- It's four hours before game time and Jack Cain already is wilting 
under the Oregon sun. "Something will go wrong today," he says assuredly. "You 
always panic. I have a phobia about forgetting to put the flag up." 
</P>
<P>
The key is damage control. The Bucks are already on the field when a player 
wanting to stretch his calves presses both hands against a freshly painted 
advertisement on the right-field fence. Cain smiles. There are easier ways to 
make a living. Cain was a 35-year-old gas station owner in 1981 when he and 
Mary put down their life savings, $63,000, to purchase the Bend Bucks. Cain had 
played some football at Pacific University outside Portland before tearing up a 
knee and never quite kicked his addiction to sports. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my midlife crisis," he said of the purchase. "Some guys buy Porsches or 
chase fast women. I bought a team. I knew I was never going to be rich, so why 
not have fun?" 
</P>
<P>
Cain says he has had offers of $400,000 for the Bucks, but he's not selling as 
long as he can keep squeezing a $40,000 profit out of the team each season. 
It's a tough 40 grand. The Angels pay the player salaries -- $850 per month -- 
and help out with some expenses. Cain pays motel costs for 18 of his team's 29 
players and the Angels make up the difference. The Cains rely heavily on gate 
receipts, which is why packing Vince Genna Stadium -- capacity 2,250 -- is so 
important. The Bucks play a 72-game season with 38 home dates. They drew 43,587 
fans last season despite the team's 38-38 record. It was a good year. 
</P>
<P>
2:15 -- Bad news on the doorstep. Tonight's opponent, the Southern Oregon A's, 
are stranded 20 miles outside of Bend after their bus broke down. Bob Cain, 
Jack's 21-year-old son and jack-of-all-trades, will keep him posted. It's 
always something. 
</P>
<P>
2:45 -- Angels owner Gene Autry's voice -- I'm back in the saddle again -- 
booms over the loud speakers during an early-afternoon sound check. It's about 
as close as the Bend Bucks get to Anaheim. Autry doesn't get to Oregon much. 
"I've never met him," Cain said. 
</P>
<P>
3:15 -- An anxious Cain is about to call down to Medford to see what's keeping 
the A's when he gets word from Bob that the bus has been repaired and the A's 
are on their way. Cain sighs with relief. An opener with two teams is always so 
much easier. 
</P>
<P>
3:30 -- Bob Hards, play-by-play man and general manager, is panicked. He thinks 
he has left his game notes back in Medford, where the Bucks opened the season 
two nights before. He hits the airways on KBND in less than three hours. 
</P>
<P>
"How embarrassing," Hards says. "I'll just have to sound like an idiot 
tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Hards is 38 and embarking on a new career after seven years as a drummer in a 
traveling Top 40 lounge band. 
</P>
<P>
"We did Holiday Inns coast to coast," he said. "The band thing had run its 
course. This is a stable job compared to music." 
</P>
<P>
Hards' first love has always been broadcasting, and now he's lucked into the 
job as Voice of the Bend Bucks. As general manager, he's also responsible for 
selling radio and print sponsorship, but that's just grunt work until air time. 
</P>
<P>
"This is heaven every night in the summer," Hards says as he continues a 
frantic search for his notes. 
</P>
<P>
Hards says he'll ship out his play-by-play tapes after this season and hope for 
the best. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll try to move up after this year," he says. "Everyone in this business 
wants to be the next Vinny. My goal is to be that good. I'd like to be offered 
a major league job, but if I don't end up in Dodger Stadium, I will not be 
broken-hearted." 
</P>
<P>
He will be if he doesn't find those notes. 
</P>
<P>
3:45 -- Justin Martin is a pitcher and one of four returning Bucks from last 
year's squad. Don't say it too loud. His right arm is wrapped in ice as he 
tries to reduce the swelling from his Friday night start, in which he took the 
loss after being held to a 60-pitch limit. 
</P>
<P>
Martin had been throwing for Quad Cities before getting pulled from the 
rotation. Now he's back in Bend. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm only 19, so it's better for me to be back," he says. "I don't want to be 
back, but I think it's to my benefit." 
</P>
<P>
Martin was a 34th-round draft choice out of McKay High School in Salem, Ore., 
but opted to pitch a year at Mt. Hood Community College instead. 
</P>
<P>
He signed with the Angels this month, the night before the major league draft 
in fact. The contract was signed between bites at a local Dennys, which is 
fitting because he's eating there so often these days. So what does a young 
Buck do on 11 bucks a day? 
</P>
<P>
"You eat only twice," Martin explains. "The night before I pitch, I use my own 
money and go to a nice pasta place to get protein. On eight-day trips, you can 
buy one of those $1.25 coolers and pack baloney sandwiches." 
</P>
<P>
Martin is giving himself until age 25 to make the majors. He received a $17,500 
signing bonus from the Angels plus another $12,000 for college after his 
playing days are over. He's been timed in the 90s on the radar gun. Martin 
thinks he has a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to think you're the one," he says. 
</P>
<P>
4 p.m. -- "Something's got to go wrong," Jack Cain says as he passes by in a 
huff. "But at least I got the flag up." 
</P>
<P>
4:20 -- First player: "You're DHing tonight, right? Can I borrow your cup? I 
left mine at home." 
</P>
<P>
Second player: "My cap or my cup?" 
</P>
<P>
First player: "Your cup." 
</P>
<P>
Second player: "Oh, sure." 
</P>
<P>
4:30 -- Manager Don Long, who had been drilling his team in fundamentals since 
2 p.m., finally takes a break. The chances of anyone making it out of here to 
the big leagues are slim, but Long never lets on. What if someone set the odds 
of his ever managing in the majors? Fact: Only 12 of the 300 or so players who 
have passed through here in the last decade have played in the majors. The most 
famous Buck graduates are Juan Samuel, recently traded from the Phillies to the 
Mets, and Rick Schu of the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Long makes this much clear: He doesn't cater to prospects. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as a guy is playing for me, I don't care how good or bad he is," Long 
says. "I've seen coaches hang their hats on certain players and then when he 
makes it they say, 'I made him.' That's bull. I'd rather work with 25 guys who 
are treated fairly." 
</P>
<P>
And who is Long to play God? 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have the right to do that," he says. "You work under the assumption 
all will make it. If you don't, it affects the way you work with them." 
</P>
<P>
Making it to the majors comes down to hard work and breaks, he says. Long got 
his as a manager after his minor league playing career fizzled in 1985. He 
coached a year at Seattle University and then served an internship with the 
Everett (Wash.) Giants, which were run by Bob Bavasi, brother of Bill, the 
Angels' director of minor league operations. 
</P>
<P>
At Everett, Long served as groundskeeper, traveling secretary and statistician. 
He also served coffee, helped build a scoreboard and called in scores to the 
local papers. 
</P>
<P>
With a kind word from Bavasi, Long landed a coaching position with the Angels' 
affiliate in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
He begins his second season as manager in Bend. 
</P>
<P>
And one more thing: He didn't care much for the movie "Bull Durham." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like the manager in the movie," Long says. "He was portrayed as a guy 
who didn't do a whole lot. If my guy was on the top of a dryer (with a girl) 
when I walked in, he'd be done." 
</P>
<P>
4:45 -- Bob Hards finds his game notes! 
</P>
<P>
5 p.m. -- It's an hour before game time and all hell has broken loose, just as 
Jack Cain promised. The three-wheeled, all-terrain vehicle Bucky Buck uses to 
entertain the crowd between innings won't start. Bucky is more popular than any 
player (he comes back every year) and the prospect of a game without Bucky 
doing wheelies in the outfield is chilling. 
</P>
<P>
How big is Bucky? Last year, three Bend-area children dressed up as Bucky Buck 
for Halloween. Kids follow him around the stands as if he were the Pied Piper. 
Bucky signs more autographs than any player. 
</P>
<P>
Who is Bucky? It's a closely guarded secret in Bend. Bucky doesn't want his 
identity known, especially by children or his mother. He's afraid it will ruin 
the fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
Bucky usually sneaks in a back entrance to the stadium shortly before game time 
and dresses in an adjoining house. 
</P>
<P>
There, Bucky puts on his furry suit and antlers. Bucky's head reminds you of 
something that might hang over the fireplace at an Elks Lodge. 
</P>
<P>
Before he dresses on Sunday, Bucky Buck is cornered for a rare interview. He's 
actually Curt Winchell, a 26-year-old substitute school teacher in Bend. Now 
you know why he doesn't want the kids to know. Can you imagine a child's horror 
knowing he has been assigned math homework by Bucky Buck? 
</P>
<P>
Let's also get this straight: Bucky is a clean act. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't do anything rude or crude," Bucky says. "Well, I lift my leg and honk 
a horn." 
</P>
<P>
Bucky's is not an easy job. Last year, stealing a scene from the just-released 
movie Bull Durham, an Everett pitcher buzzed Bucky's head with a fastball while 
warming up between innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 20 feet from the mound," Bucky recalled. "But even if it hit me in the 
head, I wouldn't feel a thing." 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks considered the knockdown pitch intentional, and Long assured that if 
the Everett Giants ever got their own mascot, retaliation would be in order. 
</P>
<P>
Undaunted, Bucky Buck yucks on. He's going to send his tapes out soon, too. 
</P>
<P>
"The Chicken is my idol," he says. "I'd like to make it to the bigs someday. I 
know it's not something you can go to school for, but I can be anything I want 
under that thing." 
</P>
<P>
But tonight the three-wheeler won't start. Bucky Buck might have to wing it. 
</P>
<P>
5:07 -- Jack Cain begins greeting fans at the gate. Meanwhile, an ice freezer 
breaks down in one of the concessions stands. Cain orders his son Bob to the 
store for dry ice. Fifty-three minutes until game time. 
</P>
<P>
6 p.m. -- Showtime. Bucky Buck, having borrowed a smaller three-wheeler, bursts 
from the right-field corner to a standing ovation. He rides an extended wheelie 
and nearly catches an antler in the right-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
One of the characters from Bartles and Jaymes wine cooler commercial fame 
tosses out the first ball, though we never find out whether he's Bartles or 
Jaymes. 
</P>
<P>
6:17 -- Bucks shortstop Brian Specyalski gets the first hit of the home season, 
a broken-bat single to left. 
</P>
<P>
7:30 -- The Bucks blow a 3-1 lead as the Southern Oregon A's roll out six runs 
in the fifth inning, ignited by a key Bend error on a possible double-play ball 
that could have ended the inning. So what time do the Bucks take the field for 
fundamentals tomorrow? 
</P>
<P>
The saddest moment of the inning was the relief appearance by Paul Swingle, who 
threw 12 consecutive balls before being removed. The Bend crowd is loyal, but 
not necessarily kind. "Put Bucky in to pitch!" one fan shouted. 
</P>
<P>
7:45 -- The A's score three more runs in the sixth and the rout is on. The only 
blessing is that the game is almost impossible to see with the sun setting over 
the left-field fence. Jack Cain admits Vince Genna Stadium was laid out 
incorrectly, but you do with what you have. He used to start the games at 7:30 
until he realized that no matter what the score, everyone left at 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Cain had ordered a sunscreen material to be wrapped around the fence behind 
home plate, but the lady in charge of delivery left the office early on Friday 
and never placed the order. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Hards has considerable trouble identifying players for his live radio 
broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
8:15 -- Bear Bangs, the 14-year-old kid who dragged the infield before the 
game, has changed hats and shirts and now tries to sell bags of peanuts. He 
makes 20% commission and guesses he'll rake in $20 bucks for the day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just something to put on my resume," Bangs said. 
</P>
<P>
And yes, his first name is really Bear. 
</P>
<P>
8:45 -- It's early in the season and Hards, game notes and all, still doesn't 
have a lot of information on opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's number 40 for the A's. We don't know very much about him. We know he's 
a left-handed hitter . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Did Vin Scully have days like this? 
</P>
<P>
9:07 -- Tom Rudstrom grounds to second to end the game. The Bucks lose, 11-4, 
committing four errors. 
</P>
<P>
9:30 -- Pitcher Wayne Helm, from Laguna Hills High School and Pepperdine, sits 
in an empty Bucks dugout and watches Bear Bangs drag the infield. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim seems like a million miles away. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," Helm says, "it does. But they told me (Angel pitcher Chuck) Finley only 
played one year of A ball. And (Jim) Abbott never played in the minors. I hope 
to be in double A next year." 
</P>
<P>
Bend isn't such a bad place, really. But Helm is getting married in November 
and misses his fiancee, Eve Carr. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big adjustment," he says of leaving home and his girl behind. "We 
should be together all the time. But this is the future and we just said let's 
make the most of it." 
</P>
<P>
Time to grow up. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a California boy," Helm says, "I miss home, but it's always good to have 
an experience like this. I thought it would be a drag, all the cruddy motels 
and holes. But it's been nice." 
</P>
<P>
Helm isn't much for looking at the odds, either. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the chance you take," he says. "I believe I can make it. I'm not going to 
give up. Sometimes it gets depressing, but you can't play that (mind) thing 
that you're not going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
9:45 -- Bucky Buck takes off his deer head. He's lost 10 pounds in 
perspiration. Who said show biz was easy? 
</P>
<P>
10 p.m. -- Jack Cain is exhausted, but it's a good kind of tired. He'll be here 
a while, too. Someone has to turn out the lights. 
</P>

KRAUSE COMES BACK FOR NORTH GIRLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Allison Krause is not the type of person to let an sprained ankle keep her from 
playing in the Orange County All-Star basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
Krause, who turned the ankle at the North team's practice Wednesday, had to 
overcome a much more serious injury to play as a senior this past season. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of her junior year at Marina High School, after setting a school 
record for most assists in a season (175), Krause suffered the same type of 
injury to her left knee that has sidelined Clipper star Danny Manning. 
</P>
<P>
When she tells Manning she knows what he is going through, she does know. And 
she does tell him. 
</P>
<P>
Krause decided to write to Manning when she read about his injury. They have 
been corresponding and talking on the telephone occasionally ever since. Krause 
has even invited Manning to tonight's All-Star game at UC Irvine's Bren Center 
at 5:05. No word yet on whether he will attend. 
</P>
<P>
Krause began writing to Manning, in care of the Sports Arena, to try and cheer 
him up. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wrote him a letter and sent him a couple of articles on me and my 
recovery," Krause said. 
</P>
<P>
"And I said if I can do this, you can do this 20 times better than I can. I 
just wanted to encourage him. I gave him my phone number and address and said 
call me if you ever get bored doing your little leg lifts and he called me the 
day he got the letter. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't believe it. He just started asking about my knee, how it happened, 
about my brace." 
</P>
<P>
These days, Krause's knee is doing well enough to earn her a partial athletic 
scholarship to Cal State Dominguez Hills, where she will study to be a physical 
therapist. 
</P>
<P>
But she is still a little slower than before her surgery and though there is no 
pain when she plays, she said ice after games is now her best friend. 
</P>
<P>
The injury occurred Jan. 19, 1988 with 19 seconds left in a Sunset League game 
against Huntington Beach and her team leading by three points. She remembers 
the day and the circumstances to the second. 
</P>
<P>
Krause, a point guard, attempted to dribble away from a trap. She came to a 
sudden stop. 
</P>
<P>
"Something went wrong," she said. "I didn't really know how bad it was. There 
was just the pain. That is what scared me the most. I had never felt anything 
like that before. 
</P>
<P>
"I always tell my friends, take two big tug of war ropes and twist them 
together and twist them together until they start to fall apart and then light 
a flame under them, and that is what it felt like. It was just twisting and 
burning and twisting and burning." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Doug Jackson, a Long Beach-based orthopedic surgeon, confirmed her worst 
fear. Her anterior cruciate ligament, one of the four bands that helps hold the 
knee in place, was torn. 
</P>
<P>
Krause tried to strengthen the leg without surgery but a month later, in her 
first game back, her knee collapsed again. 
</P>
<P>
It was time for surgery. 
</P>
<P>
She came through the reconstructive surgery and three hours a day of 
often-painful rehabilitation to captain the basketball team her senior season. 
She averaged 5.7 points and 6.5 assists per game for a 17-9 team. 
</P>
<P>
Krause finished her high school career as Marina's career assist leader (535). 
</P>
<P>
But it took a while to get back to form. 
</P>
<P>
The old Allison Krause dove for loose balls. The Allison Krause with the 
repaired knee did not. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to (say), 'Oh, you can take that. I don't want to hurt my knee.' " 
</P>
<P>
She is a lot more aggressive now, Krause said. She goes up strong for layups 
and is not afraid to go up in a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The North will need all the aggressiveness it can get to even the score with 
the South team. 
</P>
<P>
The South has eight victories in the 11 all-star games. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Starting for the South: forwards Keri Erkenbrack of Canyon and Kristen McDonald 
of Valencia, center Holly Anderson of Capistrano Valley, and guards Christa 
Ramirez of Canyon and Kristen Bevis of El Toro. Starting for the South: 
forwards Lisa Rios of Savanna and Joni Easterly of Katella, center Wendy 
Carlson of Katella, and guards Stacey Hisaka of Fountain Valley and Heidi 
Sorour of Loara. . . . The South squad is coached by Stan DeMaggio of 
Capistrano Valley with assistant Mary Mulligan of San Clemente. Brad Pickler of 
Savanna, assisted by Barb Bausch of Katella, coaches the North.

BIG HORIZONS FOR MR. MINIBLIND; 
</P>
<P>
LOW OVERHEAD, A DECLINING DRAPERIES MARKET OFFERS WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO 
ENTREPRENEURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six months ago, Vince Paglia announced that he was leaving his job as national 
franchising coordinator for the Prudential Real Estate Affiliate program. 
</P>
<P>
His secretary at Prudential, he said, shrieked, " 'You're going to leave to 
hang blinds?' " when he disclosed the reason for his departure. 
</P>
<P>
After 13 years as a corporate franchise executive -- 11 years at Coldwell 
Banker Residential Real Estate in Newport Beach and two years with Prudential 
in Costa Mesa -- Paglia was trading in his pinstripes and briefcase for a 
T-shirt and a set of tools. 
</P>
<P>
Paglia became the Mr. Miniblind franchisee for Palm Springs and the Coachella 
Valley. And he couldn't be happier. "This is an idea that has all the elements 
of success," Paglia said. "Already, I'm at the point where I'm going to have to 
hire a part-time installer to help out. I've got too much business to handle 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
Paglia is one of 52 U.S. franchisees recruited in only 14 can offer because of 
the volume discounts the company gets from its suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
To get into the business, potential franchisees must buy a territory for 
$25,000 and buy or lease a van from the dealer of their choice. Other expenses, 
including office supplies, tools, insurance, the first month's advertising fee 
and a city business license, can run an additional $1,500 or so. 
</P>
<P>
After buying a franchise, ongoing expenses include monthly royalty payments to 
Mr. Miniblind Inc. of 5% of gross sales, and a monthly advertising fee of 
another 5% of gross sales or $1,000, whichever is greater. 
</P>
<P>
The advertising money is used to buy lots of advertising in local and regional 
newspapers, including Sunday-supplement magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Huckins said that his saturation techniques, and the ability to target 
advertising to benefit ailing franchise territories, mean that most Mr. 
Miniblind franchisees don't have to make cold sales calls unless they want to. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Miniblind is a business born out of necessity. It was conceived when a 
personal bankruptcy left the Huckinses, former owners of a window and wall 
decorating store in Irvine, with little but a van and an 1,100-square foot 
condominium in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
They started out selling mini-blinds in Irvine and Laguna Niguel, and have 
retained the franchises for those two territories. The idea took off, and 
today, the Huckinses preside over a thriving franchise empire. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Mr. Miniblind recorded slightly more than $1 million in gross sales. 
The Huckinses claim they realize a 25% profit from the business, which they 
share with three employees hired to operate the two franchises while they 
operate the franchising company. 
</P>
<P>
It was the success of their own Mr. Miniblind franchises that enabled the 
Huckinses to rebound from their bankruptcy, and the bankruptcy taught them 
lessons that have contributed to the success of the franchising business, 
Christina said. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the Huckinses designed Mr. Miniblind to be a business that 
doesn't require much capital to get into and that doesn't tie up large chunks 
of money. 
</P>
<P>
For another, the Huckinses say they live off the profits from their personal 
franchises and have put every penny of profit from the franchising operations 
into the bank -- giving the business a strong capital base. 
</P>
<P>
Mark, 35, grew up in Downey and worked his way through high school and college 
installing draperies and blinds. After graduating from Loma Linda University in 
Riverside with a degree in business management, he opened a decorating store, 
Mark Huckins Interiors, in Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
He met and married Christina, 36, about two years later. Shortly after the 
marriage, he attempted to franchise the retail decorating concept, which he had 
renamed "I Love Drapes." 
</P>
<P>
He sold three franchises before realizing that it was not an idea whose time 
had come. 
</P>
<P>
"We discovered that draperies actually were a shrinking part of the window 
treatment market," Christina said, "and we also discovered that, for that type 
of business to be successful as a franchise, we had to be able to sell the 
franchises to clones of Mark." It turned out that most people did not have his 
decorating experience and sense of design aesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
So they moved to Irvine and set up another retail decorating business. 
</P>
<P>
Christina, a native of Detroit with a business degree from Wayne State 
University, worked in hotel management in Hawaii after graduating from college. 
She then joined a real estate firm in Marina del Rey before taking a sabbatical 
to work as a volunteer in Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
It was during the campaign that she met Mark at a disco in Palm Springs. He 
proposed during the Republican National Convention in Detroit that year. 
</P>
<P>
After the campaign ended, Christina went to work as an executive headhunter for 
an Orange County recruiting firm, an experience, she said, that has helped her 
immeasurably in screening potential Mr. Miniblind franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
"But finally, Mark asked me to come into his business, and that's when we 
decided to franchise I Love Drapes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
That fiasco and the subsequent loss of their Irvine retail business behind 
them, the Huckins turned to an idea Mark had been nurturing for some time. 
</P>
<P>
So in 1986, they began Mr. Miniblind, operating with a telephone answering 
machine in their condo and everything else in a white mini-van that took them 
to their customers' homes. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to a mini-blind manufacturer's seminar that year wearing my Mr. 
Miniblind T-shirt," Mark said, "and everyone there was from a drapery store. 
Then a speaker said that drapes accounted for only 15% of the market while 
blinds and other alternative coverings were 85% of the market." 
</P>
<P>
It was right after that seminar that Mark filed for trademark protection for 
the Mr. Miniblind name and Christina began formulating plans for franchising 
the operation. 
</P>
<P>
According to the International Franchise Assn., a typical domestic franchise 
operation sells two franchises its first year and averages less than a dozen 
franchise sales a year for the next two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
The Huckinses took their show on the road for the first time in April, 1988, 
setting up a booth at a franchise show in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
They sold eight franchises that week. 
</P>
<P>
By September, when they were approached by a business broker about selling a 
master franchise in Japan, they'd sold 18 territories, all in California. As of 
this month, they've sold 52, mostly in Southern California but with a few in 
the northern part of the state, two in Arizona and one in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, they signed a deal for an estimated $750,000 cash plus continuing 
royalties to sell master franchise rights for Mr. Miniblind Japan to a major 
Japanese housewares manufacturer. The contract calls for 20 franchises to be 
operating by the end of the first year, and the franchise holder, LEC Inc., has 
said it can sell 1,500 throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Next on the agenda, said Christina, is Texas, then Hawaii, Washington, Oregon 
and the rest of the western states. Then the rest of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had calls from people in Atlanta and Detroit who want to buy franchises 
already," she said. "Our strategy calls for us to move fast. We want to be 
national by the end of next year." 
</P>
<P>
Paglia, the former Prudential franchising executive who bought the Palm Springs 
and Coachella Valley territory from Mr. Miniblind, is being courted by the 
Huckinses. They want him to become an executive again, heading up the national 
franchising drive. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still negotiating," Paglia said.

STOCK WATCH: ADVANCED IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS TO GO PUBLIC WITH AMERICUS FUNDING 
MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Advanced ImmunoTherapeutics Inc., founded by the controversial former head of 
Newport Pharmaceuticals Inc., will go public, the company's president said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
AIT President Alvin Glasky said the Irvine company plans to merge with publicly 
traded Americus Funding Corp., a blind-pool partnership in Colorado. Glasky 
expects the merger to be complete within a month. 
</P>
<P>
A blind pool is an entity that raises money from investors for the purposes of 
acquiring other firms, which are not identified until after the money is 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
Glasky, who founded Irvine-based AIT last year, was removed from his position 
at Newport Pharmaceuticals in 1986, shortly after the company was criticized by 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for promoting a drug without federal 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
Glasky founded Newport Pharmaceuticals in 1986. The firm unsuccessfully sought 
U.S. approval of the drug Isoprinosine as a treatment for diseases ranging from 
AIDS to a rare brain disorder. The drug has still not been approved for use in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
AIT currently is developing drugs that it claims could modify the body's immune 
system and be used to treat cancer, AIDS or Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
Glasky said the company, which has not yet produced any revenue, lost about 
$600,000 last year, adding that it will have a similar loss this year. 
</P>
<P>
Being publicly held will provide AIT with money to develop its drugs, he 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
Glasky and other AIT investors will own 88% of the firm, with Americus 
shareholders getting the rest, he said. Americus went public in November, 
issuing 50 million shares at a penny per share. Glasky said the stock recently 
has sold for 1 3/4 cents to 2 1/2 cents per share in over-the-counter "pink 
sheet" trading. 
</P>
<P>
A stock market analyst said that Glasky likely will be greeted with skepticism 
by investors, who could have concerns about how Glasky and his company will be 
viewed by the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
Glasky acknowledged that he is a controversial figure but said he doesn't 
expect a cool reception from Wall Street investors, some of whom became angered 
by fluctuations in the value of Newport Pharmaceuticals stock during Glasky's 
management of that firm. 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of management, AIT may not receive much attention from investors, 
who have grown weary of the proliferation of small, upstart biotechnology 
firms, according to Jeff Kilpatrick, president of Newport Securities, a Costa 
Mesa brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
"The promises of almost all of those companies have not come true," said 
Kilpatrick, who does not recommend investment in the company. 
</P>
<P>
Wespercorp is a company without a stock exchange. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Irvine firm was dropped from the American Stock Exchange because 
it no longer meets the financial standards required for listing. 
</P>
<P>
George Dashiell, chairman and president of the firm, said he had received 
"verbal approval" for a listing on the Boston Stock Exchange. But he hadn't yet 
received the go-ahead from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is 
required before Wespercorp can resume trading on an exchange. 
</P>
<P>
The computer-equipment manufacturer was dropped by the American exchange 
because it failed to have the necessary market capitalization and shareholder 
equity. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed an aggregate value of $1 million of publicly held stock," Dashiell 
said. "Ours is worth $218,000." 
</P>
<P>
The American exchange also requires at least $4 million of shareholder equity, 
while Wespercorp has a negative shareholder equity of $895,000, Dashiell said. 
</P>
<P>
Wynn's International in Fullerton said that New York money manager Mario J. 
Gabelli purchased 38,100 shares of stock in May and June, boosting his stake in 
the Fullerton firm to 19.24%, or 729,250 shares. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Gibbons, vice president and counsel for the automotive parts and 
additives manufacturer, said that Gabelli is interested in Wynn's only as an 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
Provena Foods said it will repurchase up to 50,000 shares of its common stock 
issued during its August, 1987, public offering. The Santa Ana company already 
had announced its intention to buy 70,000 shares. 
</P>
<P>
"The stock from time to time trades at prices we perceive as less than 
reasonable value," said Jim Bolton, Provena's chairman. He said the purchases 
were also part of an effort to reduce any dilution that shareholders may 
experience as stock is purchased by employees through a company program. 
</P>
<P>
Provena is a specialty food processor and distributor that caters to pizza and 
pasta companies.

In some Friday editions, a headline incorrectly stated that the desert tortoise 
had been added to the state's endangered species list. In fact, the tortoise is 
now considered a threatened species, a less serious designation.
