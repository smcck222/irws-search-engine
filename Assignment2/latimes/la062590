Belgium said it might free a Palestinian guerrilla from prison if a family of 
four held hostage in Lebanon is released. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens said in Brussels that he had recently met with 
relatives of Emmanuel Houtekins, his wife, Godelieve Kets, and their two 
teen-age children. He said the relatives are "almost desperate." The four were 
seized from a yacht in the Mediterranean in 1987 by a Palestinian group led by 
Abu Nidal. Nasser Said is serving a life sentence for a 1980 grenade attack in 
Antwerp that resulted in the death of a child, but he is eligible for parole 
next month.

A young Soviet hijacker claiming to have a bomb in his briefcase forced a 
Soviet domestic airliner with 78 passengers to land in Finland, then 
surrendered to police, airport officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The hijacker, a 21-year-old Russian identified as M. Varfolomeyev, asked for 
political asylum in Finland. Soviet authorities have asked for his extradition. 
It was the second hijacking of a Soviet aircraft to Finland in less than a week 
and the third to Scandinavia in two weeks.

There is little hope that the talks will succeed unless President Samuel K. Doe

<P>
HEALTH CARE: GOVERNMENT, RENEGING ON ITS RESPONSIBILITY, IS FORCING HOSPITALS 
TO LEAN ON PRIVATELY INSURED PATIENTS TO PAY FOR THE INDIGENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD KENNEDY, Donald Kennedy is president of Stanford University and 
chairman of the board of directors of Stanford University Hospital. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court decision holding that hospitals have a right to "reasonable 
and adequate" payment under Medicaid (in California, Medi-Cal) could benefit 
academic medical centers, and it is likely to be a significant victory for the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
Academic medical centers nationally treat disproportionately high numbers of 
indigent patients. In 1987, their teaching hospitals accounted for 34% of 
Medicaid-reimbursed discharges, with 14% of their gross revenues derived from 
the government program. The hospitals also accounted for $2.1 billion, or 59%, 
of all "charity care" -- that is, care of individuals unable to pay and lacking 
Medicaid coverage. 
</P>
<P>
As the federal government requires more services for low-income people under 
the Medicaid program, the states sharing the costs of the program underfund it, 
and the academic centers get the brunt of the financial hits. Unless they make 
their case for better rates, some of them will have a difficult time surviving. 
With the law on their side, they may succeed, because the alternative -- to be 
forced by financial necessity to turn their backs on the poor -- is both 
unpalatable and wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Academic medical centers have a long tradition in caring for the poor; indeed, 
improving the human condition is the goal that spawned them in the first place. 
Without this commitment, they would be simply another indistinguishable part of 
our profit-oriented society, and the young doctors and others they turn out -- 
and society-at-large -- would be the poorer for it. But government actions make 
their future less assured. 
</P>
<P>
The situation in California, and at my institution in particular, is a case in 
point. In 1983 the state adopted competitive bidding as a mechanism for 
controlling Medi-Cal costs. It appointed a commission to bargain with competing 
hospitals, and Stanford University Hospital was among those awarded contracts. 
But the state has since failed to accept the participating hospitals' costs, 
even though they result from the bidding process and are based on acceptable 
medical practice and prevailing market conditions. Over time, the state has 
attempted to force those bids to fit some predetermined state budget target. 
</P>
<P>
At Stanford Hospital the number of Medi-Cal patients has been increasing 12% 
annually since 1988, out of proportion to the number of fully paying patients. 
Medi-Cal patients now represent 19% of all patient days, and in some services 
even more. In our obstetrics and gynecology service, for example, 32.4% of this 
year's patients have been under Medi-Cal. The county hospital in San Mateo has 
no obstetrical service or newborn nursery, and private obstetricians are so 
poorly reimbursed by the state that most decline to take Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
These women do not receive adequate -- if any -- prenatal care, and they often 
arrive in our hospital in active labor. A disproportionate number of their 
babies are underdeveloped, HIV-positive or drug-addicted, and require 
around-the-clock neonatal intensive care. 
</P>
<P>
More than one-quarter of the indigent patients admitted to Stanford come from 
outside Santa Clara County and neighboring San Mateo County. They are very sick 
and require longer stays, causing a disproportionate drain on hospital funds. 
</P>
<P>
Our hospital this year will spend $51.7 million on Medi-Cal patients, but will 
receive only $22.1 million in reimbursement from the state. Loss of income from 
the state's failure to cover other costs is estimated at $5.9 million (though a 
current negotiation with the state may provide some relief). In addition, our 
faculty medical practice, which collects less than 29 cents on the dollar 
billed to Medi-Cal, had bad debts of $9.3 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Thus we are stuck with $44.8 million of uncompensated care. As a private, 
nonprofit institution, our hospital can turn to no other source to make up a 
loss of this magnitude. The hospital gets no tax support or state subsidies for 
its teaching programs; it depends on patient revenues. When the government pays 
a fraction of the cost, the difference must be passed on to privately insured 
patients -- and we don't think they should be penalized that way. 
</P>
<P>
Like all hospitals, ours also faces severe competitive pressures. Local 
businesses and consumers look to us for leadership in reducing health-care 
costs. We have responded with a program to improve efficiency, and we have cut 
$30 million from the hospital's $320 million operating budget this year -- and 
there are more cuts to come. But if we continue to carry the burden of 
uncompensated care, we may not succeed in this effort. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike community hospitals, which offer care to a relatively homogenous and 
affluent population, academic centers must fulfill multiple functions. They 
train students, resident physicians and others, and serve as sites for research 
to advance new diagnoses and lifesaving therapies. They must offer training 
across the full range of clinical activity. 
</P>
<P>
Academic medical centers have depended on revenues from paying patients to 
support their work. Without a large base of private patients, financial 
difficulties could force them to close. Neither their insistence on maintaining 
a sound financial base nor their expectation of fair treatment from Medicaid is 
self-serving. Their ability to serve the public depends on both. Our academic 
centers are a national resource that deserves protective government policies to 
ensure adequate -- just adequate -- reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, government is saying that it's better for the costs of people who 
are poor and ill to be borne by those who are wealthy and ill, rather than by 
those who are well-off and healthy. No one in his right mind would dream up 
such a cynical policy, but that's precisely the policy now operative in 
Medicaid.

MAN-MADE TUNNELS AT MCMARTIN PRE-SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reply to "Parents Dig Persistently for Evidence," Metro, June 5: 
</P>
<P>
Jackie McGauley is paraphrased in the caption above her picture as stating she 
believes the pentagram on a plate found at the McMartin Pre-school site is 
among evidence of alleged satanic rituals at the school. Although it is a 
bizarre find, Mrs. McGauley has never made this statement, not even to her 
closest associates. 
</P>
<P>
Only further research can establish this possibility. 
</P>
<P>
The article states that the parents and I have tried to make the public believe 
that a long-rumored network of underground tunnels were discovered in early 
June. The reporter states I offered boxes and boxes of artifacts as "further 
proof that the preschool operators maintained and then tried to cover up a 
tunnel system." I have never accused the McMartins or Buckeys of this. 
</P>
<P>
My statements thus far have been clear and concise, that the results of the 
excavation by the archeologists, geologists and their team simply proved that 
there were man-made tunnels under the preschool foundation as alleged by the 
children.

DEBATE OVER REVITALIZATION OF OLVERA STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with dismay (June 12) that City Council members Richard Alatorre and 
Gloria Molina oppose the restoration of the Italian Hall as part of the 
revitalization of El Pueblo Historic Park. 
</P>
<P>
This significant building is one of the park's 27 important landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
Representing a variety of architectural styles and types, these historic 
structures are among the most eloquent testaments to our city's diverse 
cultural heritage. Together, they form an ensemble of memories commemorating an 
era that began when the plaza was at the center of a small pueblo located on 
the edge of the Spanish empire and continued into the 20th Century when the 
plaza became a focus of industrial activity and a home for various ethnic 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
But rather than celebrating this valuable legacy, Alatorre and Molina seek to 
obliterate it. Their opposition to restoring the Italian Hall is an attempt to 
rewrite history and isolate the park from its multicultural past. 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, the City Council will reject their narrow, exclusionary approach. By 
accepting the Recreation and Park Commission's authorization to restore the 
Italian Hall, the Council will go a long way in adopting a revitalization plan 
that will be faithful to the park's long and complex history.

INTERPRETING THE BILL OF RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ron Ekard is ready to declare the Second Amendment null and void (letter, June 
20) because "none of today's guns are covered by the Second Amendment." He 
should use more care in interpreting the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the many other things that did not exist "in those days": radio, 
television, photography, xerography, records, tapes, compact disks to name a 
few. Yet, First Amendment protection has been readily extended to all of these. 
Is Ekard ready to foreclose protection for these on the unconvincing grounds 
that they were not around when the Constitution was written? Or do we rally 
around the Bill of Rights only for non-Second Amendment causes? 
</P>
<P>
I am concerned over the growing number of gun-related crimes, but I would hope 
our response might be a bit more creative than the narrow interpretation 
suggested by Ekard.

By DAVID T. FELDMAN, a Postal Service maintenance superintendent in Los 
Angeles, talked to The Times about the plan to raise first-class postage to 30 
cents. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you took all the countries of Europe and cut them out and pasted them on the 
United States, they'd all fit within the confines of the U.S., right? Every one 
of these countries charges more than 30 cents for a stamp, yet their service is 
terrible. Canada, which is much bigger than the U.S., now charges 30 cents. 
</P>
<P>
My son lives in Toronto and when I go to see him, I tote his mail back to the 
United States to mail it because Canadian service is notoriously poor. So 
basically for 30 cents, you're going to get a lot of good service. 
</P>
<P>
Now, If they privatize the Postal Service, what would happen is that the best 
routes would be taken over by private industry. The Postal Service would be 
left delivering the mail between Oshkosh (Wis.) and the Aleutian Islands. The 
Postal Service would lose the cream of the business; they'd have to raise the 
rates. Some people argue that (the rate) is not a very great bargain if you're 
mailing a local bill across the street. But if you mail something across the 
country, it's a pretty good bargain.

'HARMONIZING' WILL HANDCUFF FREE MARKETS; 
</P>
<P>
THE BUREAUCRATIC PREROGATIVE HAS SHIFTED TO ECONOMIC INTERVENTION, THE NEW 
SOCIALISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL CRAIG ROBERTS, Paul Craig Roberts is a professor of political economy 
at the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My colleague, Edward Luttwak, says that the waning of the Cold War means the 
decline of geopolitics and the rise of geo-economics. The vast bureaucracies 
that comprise the modern state and the intellectual resources organized in 
universities and think tanks will find themselves "impelled by the bureaucratic 
urges of role-preservation and role-enhancement to acquire a geo-economic 
substitute for their decaying geopolitical role." 
</P>
<P>
If he is right, it means that the West will experience a new onslaught of 
economic intervention by the state. It is ironic that the collapse of socialism 
has set in motion two opposite forces. On the one hand, socialist economic 
failure has spurred privatization and renewed commitment to a market economy. 
On the other, the decline of the communist geopolitical threat means that 
Western bureaucracies and strategic thinkers will have to find a new 
self-justification. Luttwak thinks that the bureaucratic imperative will shift 
conflict to the arena of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The new socialism will hide behind a patriotic nationalism as foreigner-bashing 
moves to the fore. Instead of defusing commercial conflicts in the interests of 
geopolitical alliances, politicians and bureaucrats will be quick to politicize 
them. The causes and instruments of conflict will become economic. Disguised 
import restrictions, concealed subsidies, public funding of commercial 
technologies and the manipulation of fiscal and regulatory measures to 
disadvantage foreign competitors are among geo-economic weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Much of this has been going on for years, but the decline of the Soviet threat 
will unleash geo-economic rivalries within the Western alliance that were 
formerly subdued by a common purpose. Industrial policy could come into its own 
as bureaucracies, politicians and commercial interests engage in symbiotic 
manipulation. As the state manages its geo-economic interests, profitability 
will be less determined by market forces. If we are indeed entering an era of 
geo-economics, economies will be increasingly characterized by rent-seeking 
activities in which people use government to create protected profits that are 
not subject to competition. Consumers everywhere will be the loser as 
governments manipulate economies in the name of survival in a competitive 
world. 
</P>
<P>
The conventional wisdom today is that the Japanese have a head start in 
geo-economic strategy and that we must rush to catch up. On the whole, the 
policies that are adopted will work to stifle competition and increase the role 
of privilege in our economic system. The world economies will suffer, just as 
the punitive measures we imposed on foreign purchasers of U.S. real estate have 
worsened the savings and loan problem. 
</P>
<P>
Already we can see within the European Community a shift away from reliance on 
market forces to harmonize national economic differences. Under the leadership 
of the French socialist Jacques Delors, the new emphasis is on social 
harmonization achieved through regulatory means. Social regulations designed to 
equalize labor costs across national boundaries are a subtle form of 
protectionism for the trade unions in the welfare democracies and French and 
German business cartels. 
</P>
<P>
Luttwak is right that a diminishing Soviet threat will give wider scope to 
rent-seekers. But the battle between privilege and competition is as old as 
economics itself, and each generation has to fight it. The other side of 
communism's decline -- the failure of state interventionism -- together with 
the dismal failure of development planning in the Third World, greatly 
strengthens the case for free markets. All over the world people have lost 
confidence in government and no longer associate more government with the 
public interest. 
</P>
<P>
Geo-economic rivalries could even work to free international businesses from 
government controls. Just as international capital markets have made it harder 
more difficult for national central banks to control domestic interest rates, 
multinational companies are unlikely to come under the sway of national 
governments. The free market itself is a powerful force, as the rise of 
extensive informal economies in Latin America and the Soviet Union demonstrate. 
As a result of 20th-Century experience, no honest intellectual can make a case 
for more state interventionism. 
</P>
<P>
As Mikhail Gorbachev recently said, the market economy "has existed for 
centuries. It is an invention of civilization."

happens in real baseball games. Even you, watching the most dreadful team in 
all of the National League, realize that. 
</P>
<P>
"Come on, how can real major league players forget how many outs there are in 
an inning? How can three-run leads vanish as if they're playing tee-ball? How 
can a Padre pitcher, who never pinch-hit before in his career, hit a three-run 
double, and be replaced by another pitcher as a pinch-runner? How a guy boot 
two balls, go hitless in his first five at-bats, then become the hero? 
</P>
<P>
"You see, there's only one explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"You have entered the Twilight Zone." 
</P>
<P>
The fans would have cheered. The Padres and Atlanta Braves could have stood 
there, breaking into laughter. And Padre Manager Jack McKeon and Brave Manager 
Russ Nixon would have felt a whole lot better. 
</P>
<P>
But as it was, everyone had to sit there and endure 4 hours and 15 minutes of 
what amounted to a simulated baseball game, before the Braves finally 
persevered, winning 11-10 in 12 innings on Andres Thomas' leadoff home run. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen some crazy games in my life," said Padre pitcher Ed Whitson, "but 
this takes the cake." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, when you get 17 hits, hit two home runs, steal seven bases, and have a 
pitcher come off the bench to deliver a three-run double in the 10th inning, 
and still lose, there's little wonder no one in the Padre clubhouse felt like 
touching a bite of dinner. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres used 23 players, including 20 in the first nine innings, leaving out 
only starter Andy Benes and reliever Eric Show. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves used 20 pitchers, including their entire bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Hurst, the Padres' starting pitcher, lasted just 1 1/3 innings, the 
shortest outing of his Padre career. Hurst (4-6), who yielded four hits and 
five earned runs, has won just one game since May 18. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Smith, the Braves' starting pitcher, hardly was better, yielding seven 
hits and lasting four innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Braves were within one strike of winning the game in the ninth inning. But 
Jack Clark drew a walk and Padre third baseman Mike Pagliarulo followed with a 
run-scoring double. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres were within two outs of winning in the 10th, owning a three-run lead 
with their best reliever on the mound, and still managed to blow the lead when 
Jeff Blauser hit a three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
So, it was only fitting, right, that the hero of this game is the same man the 
Braves crowd spent booing the entire afternoon -- shortstop Andres Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
After publicly requesting a trade earlier in the week, Thomas was booed the 
moment he stepped on the field. So you can just imagine what they thought of 
him the previous 11 innings when he booted the first ball of the game, dropped 
a throw by his catcher on a steal attempt, kicked another ball in the seventh, 
and was hitless in his first five at-bats? 
</P>
<P>
Funny, what a little home run can do to change someone's opinion. 
</P>
<P>
The homer was hit off Craig Lefferts, the same man who gave up Blauser's 
three-run homer in the 10th inning, erasing the heroics of Dennis Rasmussen, 
who hit a pinch-hit, three-run double in the top of the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
But, of course, Lefferts has pitched in four consecutive games -- 8 2/3 
innings. Incredibly, he has pitched more innings the past two weeks than 
starters Dennis Rasmussen and Hurst combined. 
</P>
<P>
"I just didn't have anything today," Lefferts said. "Usually I pitch good when 
I'm tired, but not today. It's time, I think, for a day off." 
</P>
<P>
But instead of laying the blame of this defeat in the left arm of Lefferts, or 
in the bats of Joe Carter or Garry Templeton, McKeon credited this baby to the 
carelessness of Roberto Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
It was Alomar who perhaps cost the Padres the game with his baserunning blunder 
in the 12th. He was standing on second base with one out when Joe Carter hit a 
fly ball to center field. Alomar took off running toward third, and upon seeing 
that center fielder Ron Gant would catch the ball, he eased up and casually 
rounded third. 
</P>
<P>
He became startled when he heard the screaming by his father, third base coach 
Sandy Alomar, and half of the bench. "There's only one out, Robbie, get back." 
Oh-oh. 
</P>
<P>
Alomar reversed course, ran on the inside part of third base bag, and headed 
back to the second. Whew, everything would be OK, he thought. Sorry, Brave 
third baseman Jim Presley saw everything, called for an appeal play because 
Alomar never touched the third-base bag when returning to second. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Rapuano, the third-base umpire, still called him safe. But he was overruled 
by home-plate umpire Charlie Williams, who called him out. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon bolted out of the dugout, arguing the call, while Sandy Alomar joined 
in. McKeon confessed that he never knew if Roberto Alomar had touched the 
third-base bag or not, but since he was out there, he might as well let out 
some frustration. 
</P>
<P>
Any frustration that remained inside McKeon, seeped out quite loudly after the 
game inside his office while talking about Alomar's gaffe. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got to get his head out . . .," McKeon said. "You've got to know how many 
. . . outs there are. Maybe he needs to sit down for a few days to see what the 
hell's going on. 
</P>
<P>
"Hell, you should be able to count in this game, shouldn't you. I mean, it's 
not that damn tough. He wants to be in the All-Star Game, maybe he should learn 
to count. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe what we need is to get some cards made up, so Sandy can just flash them 
up, showing one or two outs. Yeah, that's what I'll do, get some cards made 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Alomar, irritated by the perception that he was the goat, said: "I'm not going 
to give any excuses, but it's the only mistake I made. Why should I feel 
embarrassed? How can they blame the loss on me? I'm not thinking about the damn 
All-Star Game, I just want to go out and play. It's bull . . . that they blame 
this game on me. 
</P>
<P>
"If he (McKeon) wants to put up cards for the outs, let him. I don't care. It's 
fine with me." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, it's not like this is the first time the Padres have lost track of the 
outs or count in an inning. Four times in the past week the Padres have been 
confused counting to three. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Alomar turned what he thought was a double play Wednesday against the 
Giants, not realizing there were already two outs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Padre outfielder Shawn Abner walked off the field with a two-count strike 
on Joe Carter, thinking he had struck out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Padre starter Andy Benes forgot the count while pitching June 15 against 
the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And third baseman Mike Pagliarulo thought there were three outs May 9 in 
St. Louis, allowing a run to score. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the hell to do," McKeon said. "Maybe next year we'll see if 
we can have a change in the rules, and have four outs an inning. 
</P>
<P>
"You assume people can count in this game. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently not." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Eric Show on being one of only two Padres not to play Sunday: "I'm no longer 
surprised when I don't pitch, I'm surprised when I do. If I got upset over 
this, I'd be upset almost every day of this year.". . . Dennis Rasmussen raised 
his batting average to .360 after his pinch-hit double. . . . The Padres have 
hired two security guards for the players' wives for their current family trip, 
paying them $900 apiece for their seven days of service.

CRIMINAL TYPE BAGS THE GOLD CUP; 
</P>
<P>
HORSE RACING: THE 5-YEAR-OLD SON OF ALYDAR BEATS SUNDAY SILENCE BY A HEAD FOR 
HIS THIRD CONSECUTIVE VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Criminal Type has gone from being a horse who doesn't want the lead to a horse 
who won't give it up. On Sunday, continuing his role as a transcontinental 
giant- killer, Criminal Type held off Sunday Silence at the wire in one of the 
most stirring Hollywood Gold Cups ever run. 
</P>
<P>
The margin in the $1-million race was a head, and Wayne Lukas, who trains 
Criminal Type, liked the outcome so much that he shot his right fist to the sky 
as he walked across the track to greet his horse and his jockey, Jose Santos, 
after they had pulled up. 
</P>
<P>
Races with purses of $1-million or more ought to be routine for Lukas, who now 
has won 15 of them, but Criminal Type's victory Sunday was special because it 
came over last year's horse of the year and vaulted Criminal Type into the 
early No. 1 position for this year's national honors. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the year of Dick Tracy, so why not Criminal Type?" Lukas said. "This 
victory took every bit we had, and maybe that includes the three or four 
pounds, too." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, who won the Californian at Hollywood Park on June 3, in his 
first race in seven months after arthroscopic knee surgery, carried high weight 
of 126 pounds under the handicap conditions, five pounds more than Criminal 
Type. 
</P>
<P>
The stretch-long duel between the two horses was reminiscent of Sunday 
Silence's victory by a nose over Easy Goer in last year's Preakness. This time, 
though, Sunday Silence and jockey Pat Valenzuela were on the receiving end of 
the performance that got them to the wire on time in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it was the five pounds that got us beat," Valenzeula said Sunday. 
"That's a big difference between two horses when the race is a mile and a 
quarter. My horse ran super, and the wire just came up too soon. My horse 
finished well, but Criminal Type had a lot left." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence, who has lost five times in 14 starts, three of the defeats 
coming at Hollywood Park, finished 3 1/2 lengths ahead of Opening Verse, and it 
was another 2 3/4 lengths back to Santangelo, who at 49-1 was the biggest price 
in the seven-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann, Sunday Silence's entrymate, ran fifth, and Mi Selecto and Stylish 
Winner completed the order of finish. 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann, who beat Criminal Type two out of three times at Santa Anita this 
winter, including a 1 3/4-length victory over Lukas' 5-year-old in the Santa 
Anita Handicap, lost by a neck to Criminal Type in another $1-million race, the 
Pimlico Special, six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Santos, a 29-year-old Chilean-born jockey, has ridden Lukas horses for several 
years, but still sometimes misinterprets the trainer's pre-race instructions. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to take any chances on him misunderstanding, so I just told him 
to run the Pimlico race all over," Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
At Pimlico, the headstrong Ruhlmann went to the lead as he usually does, with 
Criminal Type and Santos shadowing him, and that's the way the Gold Cup was 
run. 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlmann gave up the lead sooner on Sunday, though. After an opening quarter in 
:23 1/5, a half-mile in :46 4/5 and three-quarters in 1:10 1/5, Ruhlmann found 
Criminal Type and Sunday Silence both outside him and in full gear at the 
quarter pole. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal Type had the lead heading into the stretch, and Sunday Silence was on 
the outside, right next to him. The two horses battled to the wire, with Santos 
whipping furiously at Criminal Type's flanks. 
</P>
<P>
"At the half-mile pole, I thought we were going to win," Santos said. "My horse 
has got a big heart." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Sunday Silence might have passed Criminal Type in a couple more jumps, 
Santos said: "If we had gone around (the track) another time, the result would 
have been the same. My horse would have never given up." 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Criminal Type sneaked up on the bettors, paying $6.80 to win as the 
second choice behind the Sunday Silence-Ruhlmann entry. The son of Alydar and 
Klepto, a No Robbery mare, has won nine of 22 races and he's been favored in 
only one of the victories. 
</P>
<P>
Only 30,010 attended Sunday, the second smallest crowd in the history of the 
Gold Cup, which was first run in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes this win more noteworthy is the fact that we did it after Criminal 
Type's been on the road," Lukas said. 
</P>
<P>
After winning the Pimlico Special, Criminal Type shipped from Baltimore to 
Belmont Park, where he beat Housebuster and Easy Goer, Sunday Silence's 
mainstay adversary from last year, in the Metropolitan Handicap on May 28. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a difference in the weights, but the result still might have been 
the same, knowing my horse," Lukas said Sunday. "He gets there (to the lead), 
and then he stays there and fights." 
</P>
<P>
It used to be that Criminal Type wouldn't pass horses. He's had eight second- 
and third-place finishes, and three times he's been beaten by a nose or a head. 
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron rode Criminal Type during his sluggish days. McCarron, who 
normally would have ridden Sunday Silence, is sidelined until the end of the 
year with broken legs and a broken arm and was a spectator Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Criminal Type was a sour horse and didn't do things right," McCarron said. 
"Wayne got him convinced that racing was fun." 
</P>
<P>
Criminal Type, timed in 1:59 4/5, earned $550,000, lifting his total over the 
$2-million mark. 
</P>
<P>
"It took two years for me to show him how to get his nose in front," Lukas 
said. "He wasn't too social. He didn't like to run around other horses." 
</P>
<P>
J.T. Lundy, president of Calumet Farm, followed Lukas across the track to greet 
his horse and jockey. "He's a real game horse and he ran good," Lundy said. "I 
got a little nervous when we were on the inside (of Sunday Silence)." 
</P>
<P>
The race of the summer, the $1-million Arlington Challenge Cup, is supposed to 
be between Sunday Silence and Easy Goer Aug. 4 at Arlington International. But 
now they've both been beaten by Criminal Type. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not supposed to be crashing that party, but maybe we'll crash it if 
they'll let us," Lukas said. "Maybe they'll find room for us on the 
also-eligible list. I'll buy J.T. a tie and we'll go." 
</P>
<P>
The Arlington race would be the third straight $1-million stake for Criminal 
Type. The horse is getting as accustomed as Lukas is to those kind of affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jose Santos, four-time national leader in purses, said after the Gold Cup that 
there's a good chance he will leave New York after the Breeders' Cup in late 
October and move to California. . . . The Gold Cup was the eighth win for 
Santos in a race worth $1-million or more. . . . Chris McCarron and Laffit 
Pincay have won 10 apiece, and Santos caught up with Pat Day, who was third on 
that list. . . . Among trainers, Charlie Whittingham has eight $1-million wins, 
seven less than Wayne Lukas. 
</P>
<P>
Whittingham, who has won eight Gold Cups, has now finished second in the race 
10 times. . . . Sunday Silence earned $200,000, leaving him about $31,000 short 
of the $5-million mark. . . . Sunday Silence was upset by Prized at Hollywood 
Park in last year's Swaps and he lost an allowance race, to the Lukas-trained 
Houston, as a 2-year-old in 1988. . . . The Gold Cup was Sunday Silence's first 
defeat since the Swaps and ended a three-race winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Criminal Type, whose first two racing years were spent in France, has won six 
of his last 10 starts after his career started with nine losses in 12 races. . 
. . Calumet Farm's other Gold Cup winners were Citation in 1951 and Two Lea in 
1952. 
</P>
<P>
Bold Forbes, who won the 1976 Kentucky Derby, apparently is sterile and will be 
retired as a stallion, says Aaron Jones, one of the major shareholders in the 
horse. Bold Forbes, who has been standing at Stone Farm in Paris, Ky., had a 
poor record of getting mares in foal last year and this past breeding season he 
was able to get only two mares pregnant. He is likely to be sent to the 
Kentucky Horse Park, a Lexington, Ky., tourist attraction where several horses, 
including John Henry and Forego, are spending their retirements. 
</P>
<P>
Morry's Lad, a 4-year-old gelding who won the second race in 1:57 3/5, tying 
the Hollywood Park record for 1 3/16 miles, was making his first start for 
Claude Feillatre, who bought him from the Sully Stable for $1. The victory 
Sunday was Morry's Lad's second in 13 starts.

DODGERS SEE RED IN LOSS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: THEY LOSE AGAIN TO CINCINNATI, 10-6, AND LEARN THAT BELCHER HAS AN 
INFLAMED PITCHING SHOULDER.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About the time Norm Charlton was rocking Riverfront Stadium in a 
fourth-and-goal collision with catcher Mike Scioscia Sunday, it became 
official. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger season has become one big pain. 
</P>
<P>
In the first Sunday night home game in their history, the Reds beat the 
Dodgers, 10-6, giving them two consecutive victories in the weekend series by a 
total score of 21-12. 
</P>
<P>
And that wasn't all. Before the game, pitcher Tim Belcher acknowledged what 
teammates had suspected: He is suffering from an inflamed right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Belcher, a projected top Dodger starting pitcher who has struggled with a 4.32 
earned-run average, emphasized that he will not stop pitching. 
</P>
<P>
But he has been treating the shoulder with ultrasound and stimulation therapy 
and, if it doesn't improve, he will agree to take a cortisone shot. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing that I can't pitch with, there's no real pain when I pitch, just 
discomfort," said Belcher, who has been examined by Dr. Frank Jobe. "But it has 
not felt right all year. Right now, overall, I feel like a train wreck." 
</P>
<P>
Belcher gave up seven runs in four innings Saturday in an 11-6 loss, dropping 
his record to 5-5. It was the fifth time in his last six starts that the 
Dodgers have lost. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have not felt right all year," Belcher said. "It's hard to put a finger 
on it . . . but it's like I haven't been able to get loose. Not once have I 
have felt like I've had my great stuff. If it doesn't get any better, a shot is 
the next step." 
</P>
<P>
Belcher said that he might have suffered from throwing too many pitches in his 
first game of the season, a three-hit shutout in San Diego after only three 
weeks of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
"I would do the same thing again because I was trying to win a game . . . but I 
believe that game was the problem," Belcher said. "I should not have done that 
on just three weeks of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, the owners can take that lockout and shove it. It was the worst 
mistake the owners have ever made in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
By winning two of three here, the National League West leaders have defeated 
the Dodgers five times in seven games this season. The Dodgers blew a chance to 
move within a half game of second place and instead remain in fourth, 10 1/2 
games out of first. 
</P>
<P>
But the Dodgers can take comfort in the knowledge that their next series is 
against the National League's worst team. The team traveled late Sunday to 
Atlanta, where they will begin a three-game series today with Ramon Martinez 
attempting to duplicate his 18-strikeout feat against the Braves the last time 
they met. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers happily left Cincinnati, where they weren't merely beaten, they 
were stunned. The Dodgers led six times during the weekend. The Reds came back 
and regained the lead five times. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like leads don't matter to them," said Chris Gwynn, who had his 
second home run and three runs batted in while starting in place of Kal 
Daniels. "It was like, we get a lead and -- boom -- they are right back at us. 
Like they never even worried." 
</P>
<P>
A sixth-inning homer by Gwynn scored Stan Javier, who had doubled, and gave the 
Dodgers a 4-2 lead. It was one of Javier's three hits. 
</P>
<P>
But with one out and a runner on first in the sixth, the Reds' Mariano Duncan 
lofted a single to center against starter Fernando Valenzuela. Luis Quinones 
blooped a run-scoring double to left and Joe Oliver blooped a run-scoring 
single to center. Barry Larkin blooped a run-scoring single that landed in 
shallow right field. 
</P>
<P>
"Larkin couldn't have thrown that ball any better," Gwynn said. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Sabo then made Valenzuela pay for giving up the bloop hits by hitting a 
hanging curveball for a three-run home run. Valenzuela, 5-6 with a 4.09 ERA, 
has won once in his last six starts. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Reds finished with him, they still weren't finished. They had one 
final point to make. 
</P>
<P>
In the seventh inning, on a double by Oliver, reliever Charlton ran through a 
signal to stop from third base coach Sam Perlozzo and headed toward Scioscia at 
the plate. The relay from Alfredo Griffin arrived a split second late, and 
Charlton bowled over Scioscia to score the final run. 
</P>
<P>
"Just an aggressive play," Charlton said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Todd Benzinger elaborated. 
</P>
<P>
"Scioscia did a great job of blocking the plate in that deciding play on 
Friday, and it cost us a game, so we decided it would not happen again," 
Benzinger said. "We were lucky we could get payback so soon." 
</P>
<P>
Said Scioscia: "They didn't make any point with me. I've been hit before." 
</P>
<P>
For the Dodgers, the hits just keep coming. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
A highly placed source in the Detroit Tiger organization confirmed reports that 
the Dodgers' Kirk Gibson has requested a trade. "He wants them to move him, and 
they've offered him to us," said the source, who declined to be identified. In 
interviews Sunday, neither Gibson nor Dodger Vice President Fred Claire would 
deny the report about Gibson's request. "What I choose to say behind closed 
doors is my business, and when I choose to share it, I will share it," an angry 
Gibson said. "I don't have to respond to idiotic reports. I'm not going to be 
forced to make a statement just because somebody writes an article. If somebody 
alleges something about you, do you have to respond?" 
</P>
<P>
Said Claire: "I am not going to address this situation. On any club you have 
players who have feelings about situations, and they have to talk their way 
through them. But I am not going to discuss this one." Claire acknowledged that 
reports of Gibson's trade request could lower his value, because teams know the 
Dodgers want to move him. "That could have an impact, yes," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson took batting practice with the active roster Sunday for the first time 
since suffering a strained right groin a week ago. He is improving daily. . . . 
Kal Daniels, suffering from back spasms, was examined by a local doctor 
Saturday night and ordered to rest for a couple of days. He missed his second 
consecutive start Sunday, his 13th missed start in 69 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Stan Javier extended his hitting streak to 13 games Sunday, during which he has 
21 hits in 44 at-bats for a .477 average (.360 overall). Javier has hits in 14 
of 17 starts, but acknowledged that he is helped by the fact that most National 
League pitchers have not seen him. "It is harder to be a new pitcher in a 
league, because you have to learn the hitters," Javier said. "For me, I figure, 
they have to throw me strikes, no matter who it is. And I can hit strikes." 
Javier is already one of the most disciplined hitters on the team, with 12 
walks and only 13 strikeouts.

MORNING BRIEFING: IT JUST DOESN'T FIGURE TO BE MATCH FOR AGES 
</P>

Top-seeded Ivan Lendl, still looking for his first Wimbledon championship, 
figures to have an easy time today with his first opponent, Argentina's 
Christian Miniussi. But the ATP's official players guide shows a statistic that 
makes Lendl a cinch to beat tennis' latest wonder child. The guide lists 
Miniussi's birth date as July 5, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
ATP officials said this was a typographical error and that Miniussi is 22, not 
2. 
</P>
<P>
Name game: The following is either a public service or a public nuisance, 
depending on your opinion of Chris Berman, ESPN's nickname-happy commentator 
and play-by-play man. 
</P>
<P>
No longer restrained by network management, which muzzled his nicknaming a few 
seasons ago but relented when his fans protested en masse, here is Berman's 
1990 lineup: 
</P>
<P>
Sil (When The Swallows Return To) Campusano, Philadelphia Phillies; Roberto 
(Remember The) Alomar, San Diego Padres; Mark Carreon (My Wayward Son), New 
York Mets; Eric (Little) Anthony, Houston Astros; Gary Sheffield (Of Dreams), 
Milwaukee Brewers; Robin Ventura (Highway), Chicago White Sox; Todd (Good 
Housekeeping) Zeile, St. Louis Cardinals; Jeff Ballard (Of A Thin Man), 
Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Who was the originator of Berman's "back-back-back-back-back" 
call? 
</P>
<P>
Spitting it out: Philadelphia Phillie outfielder Lenny Dykstra, when asked by 
Richard Justice of the Washington Post whether the world is ready for him: 
"Wake up, Dude, it's the 90s." 
</P>
<P>
Where's Lou Holtz?: No. 1 in the architecture poll: Sally Jenkins of the 
Washington Post recently noted Jennifer Capriati's "youthful frame of 
reference." 
</P>
<P>
In Paris for the French Open, Capriati was awed by the Cathedral of Notre Dame. 
Said the 14-year-old: "I thought we were going to a football field." 
</P>
<P>
His kind of town: Steve Jacobson of Newsday, on John Thompson's decision to 
stay at Georgetown rather than become the Denver Nuggets' general manager: "He 
would have been a strong black man working for the only black ownership in 
sports. But then he has his penchant for control, which is his at Georgetown . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
"He'd have been as big as his players, but they wouldn't be his students. And 
the job calls for some public relations skills. One of Thompson's favorite 
tricks is to return calls to media people at dawn's early light after a night 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds as if he has worked out who is in charge with the new university 
president." 
</P>
<P>
Can't take the heat: In the old-timers game played Saturday at Arlington 
Stadium, eight players were younger than Nolan Ryan, who pitched the day before 
for the Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, 40-year-old Cecil Cooper, says that's OK. "When he starts playing 
in them, I won't anymore," Cooper said. "You think I want to face that 
90-mile-an-hour fastball?" 
</P>
<P>
Toiling in obscurity: While most of Italy braced itself for Sunday's round of 
World Cup soccer games, Richard Olsen concentrated on other things. 
</P>
<P>
The 33-year old Hawaiian-born right-hander, a former minor leaguer with the 
Milwaukee Brewers' triple-A Vancouver franchise from 1979-82, pitched a partita 
perfetta (perfect game) for Grosseto of the Italian league, striking out 18 in 
a 7-0 victory over Turin. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter where it happens, it's a great feeling," Olsen told the Associated 
Press. "I've never seen a perfect game . . . it's hard to even imagine throwing 
one." 
</P>
<P>
In a game last season, Olsen retired the first 24 batters, but his teammates 
let him down. Italian rules state that if a team has a 10-run lead after seven 
innings, the game is over. Grosseto led, 10-0, at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Red Barber. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Charles Barkley, on receiving the most votes for the NBA 
all-interview team: "I say what I think. I tell the truth, and there are times 
when you are not supposed to tell the truth." TED BROCK

L.A. GAMES; 
</P>
<P>
NO. 1 LONG BEACH POLY SUBDUES VENICE, 64-52 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The field of high school basketball teams narrowed considerably in the third 
round of the 23rd L.A. Games Sunday at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
In pairings that resemble an NCAA tournament, the competition began Saturday 
with 128 boys' teams and 64 girls' teams, making this the largest event of its 
kind in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
By Sunday's end there were only 16 boys' teams and eight girls' teams to 
advance to the fourth round next Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Poly, the No. 1-seeded team in the tournament and this year's 
Southern Section 5-AA champion, held on to beat Venice, 64-52. In the first 
half, Poly dominated the court with its fast-break play and rebounding ability. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Venice made a 12-3 run on Poly in the second half. That brought 
the Gondoliers to within eight points, but it was as close as they would get. 
</P>
<P>
Poly's starters returned with two minutes to play, putting an end to the Venice 
offensive. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they'd be better, that it would be a harder game for us," senior 
Yakim Craddock said. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-3 guard scored 29 points. Tyus Edney added 22 points and 10 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Craddock will be leading the team next season as some of Poly's best players 
have graduated, including Willie McGinest, who accepted a scholarship to play 
football at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"If I had the (ball) handling down, I think (recruiters) would be starting to 
look at me a little more," Craddock said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Coach Ron Palmer: "(Craddock) dominated the game for us. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the bench will be freshman and sophomores," the coach added. "I have 
17 kids out here and some of them will play junior varsity, but I want to give 
them as much playing experience as I can." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer coached his team to victory in the 1979 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I always come into these games with a little bit of guarded optimism because 
the city teams play in a (20-game) spring league, giving them an advantage." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, eighth-seeded Reseda Cleveland advanced to the fourth round by 
routing Hamilton, 62-40. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's participation in the games came as a surprise after the resignation 
of coach Marc Paez in early June. 
</P>
<P>
Varsity assistant Bart Ostoco took over as interim coach for the games. Because 
he has been the school's junior varsity coach, he knows the kids moving up to 
the varsity level. 
</P>
<P>
"Our strongest points are our intensity and concentration," Ostoco said. 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Martin, a 6-3 1/2 shooting guard, scored 16 points, and 6-5 forward 
Kayed Murray added 10 while playing an excellent defensive game. 
</P>
<P>
"The inexperienced guys came in when the seniors weren't playing well and did 
their job," Ostoco said. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland has been a city playoff contender in recent years, but will have only 
four returning starters. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada has been the surprise thus far in the tournament, upsetting 
seventh-seeded Dorsey in the first round. The Spartans went on to defeat Bell 
Gardens and Taft to advance into a match against 10th-seeded Morningside in the 
fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' division, Washington edged Torrance, 24-22. Charisse Sampson had 
16 points, 15 rebounds, seven assists and four blocked shots for Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Powerful Lynwood has outscored opponents by 70 points in breezing to three 
victories.

WINNING MAKES A BELIEVER OF BROWN IN PRO SURF FINAL 
</P>

<P>
People were telling Santa Barbara's Chris Brown he had won the $50,000 Killer 
Loop surfing tournament Sunday at the Oceanside Pier long before the judges 
made it official. 
</P>
<P>
Brown refused to believe. 
</P>
<P>
He chose to assume he had lost, just in case. 
</P>
<P>
But Oceanside's Mike Lambresi, the three-time champion of the Professional 
Surfing Assn. of America, predicted Brown would win. 
</P>
<P>
"He's on for the tournament, not to mention, he's the most naturally gifted 
surfer on the (U.S.) tour," said Lambresi, who was eliminated in the semifinals 
earlier Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Brown wasn't taking anything for granted. At least until the winner was 
announced after Sunday's finals. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Brown can deposit a check for $7,300 -- his earnings for winning the 
fifth stop on the Bud Pro Surfing Tour. He also earned 1,000 points and moved 
into first place on the tour with 3,148, four more than Charlie Kuhn of Indian 
Harbor Beach, Fla., who was third. 
</P>
<P>
Fan favorite Rob Machado, a 16-year-old senior at San Dieguito High, was second 
in the 40-minute final. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 19, won his second tour event in his first final of the season. His 
first victory was in 1988 in an Irvine man-made wave pool. 
</P>
<P>
"This is far more pleasing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A controversial interference call on Newport Beach's Richie Collins in one 
semifinal cost him a chance to advance. Without the major penalty, Collins 
probably would have won the heat. Still, he nearly won despite only getting 
points for his best three waves instead of the normal four. 
</P>
<P>
In the Body Glove Bodyboarding division, three-time U.S. champion Mike Stewart 
of Anaheim won a close final over Hawaii's Harry Antipala (second place), Ben 
Severson (third) and Kyle Maligro (fourth). Stewart, who earned $2,075, won for 
the 27th time in 52 contests.

Cyclist Michael Secrest, 37, of Scottsdale, Ariz., finished the Race Across 
America Sunday in a record time of 7 days 23 hours 16 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Secrest rode out of Huntington Beach on June 16 and made the 2,816-mile trip to 
Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
Secrest, a native of Flint, Mich., broke the previous Race Across America 
record of 8 days 9 hours 45 minutes set in August of 1989 by Paul Solon. 
</P>
<P>
Secrest said the solo race, his seventh bicycle trip across the United States, 
was also his last. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough race," he said. "There's no getting around that." 
</P>
<P>
Secrest also won the Race Across America in 1987 and finished second in 1989.

WELCH'S SPEEDY RECOVERY LEADS TO TRIATHLON VICTORY 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three weeks ago Greg Welch was in Phoenix with fellow Australian Simon 
Skillicorn. The two were preparing for a triathlon, eyeing the course a day 
before the race when the car they were parked in was broadsided by another car 
being driven at 50 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Skillicorn suffered a broken neck. Welch came away with two cracked ribs and 
two more separated from the spine. 
</P>
<P>
No, they didn't run the next day. Skillicorn won't be running for quite some 
time and on Friday when doctors looked at Welch's X-rays, they advised him not 
to even train. 
</P>
<P>
But there was Welch, all smiles, no indication of fatigue and giving the 
thumbs-up sign in the middle of the 10-kilometer run along Harbor Drive, the 
last event in Sunday's Mountain Dew Sport San Diego International Triathlon. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, doctors said don't train, but they didn't bar him from competing. So 
Welch competed. 
</P>
<P>
At that midway point in the 10K, Welch had a 30-second lead over Miles Stewart, 
also from Australia, and Scott Molina of Boulder, Colo. It was more than 
apparent he was going to win the race, which also consisted of a one-kilometer 
swim and 30 kilometers on bike. Welch, 25, did so in a course record of 
1:27:27. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Tinley's old record was 1:27:42. 
</P>
<P>
"That was for Simon," Welch said after the victory. "I did it all for him." 
</P>
<P>
Welch was not the only one to set a course record and then proceed to tell a 
story about how quickly the human body can mend itself. Paula Newby-Fraser's 
story is not so dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
By finishing in 1:34:56, Newby-Fraser, a Zimbabwe transplant who now lives in 
Encinitas, eclipsed her own course record of 1:37:16. 
</P>
<P>
As it was for Welch, this was a surprise considering Newby-Fraser spent the 
previous six days recovering from the Nice Triathlon, which she won just a week 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
And recover is the applicable word. It took Newby-Fraser 6 1/2 hours to finish 
the Nice event, which consisted of four kilometers in water, 75 miles on bike 
and 20 miles on foot. 
</P>
<P>
By winning in France, Newby-Fraser cashed a $12,000 check. For winning in San 
Diego, she earned $1,500, as did Welch. The second-place finishers, Stewart 
(1:27:55) and Erin Baker (1:37:53), got $1,000 and the third-place finishers, 
Scott Molina (1:28:04) and Joan Alley (1:41:15), picked up $750.

<P>
Longhorn Aquatics of Austin, Tex., pulled away from the field on the final day 
of the Charlotte UltraSwim competition as it won the men's, women's and 
combined titles. 
</P>
<P>
The nearest team in each category was East Germany's squad for the Goodwill 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
Longhorn won the men's competition, 960-558, over East Germany, 960-558; the 
women's, 1,181-731; and the combined, 2,141-1,289. 
</P>
<P>
The meet featured the full 22-member East German team and 15 members of the 
U.S. team which will compete in the Goodwill Games next month in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
East German swimmers broke 17 meet records during the four-day competition, and 
earned more than $3,000 in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
The Mecklenburg Aquatic Club in Charlotte establishes a $100 prize for each 
meet record and adds another $100 for each year the meet record stands. Most of 
the records broken by the East Germans were two years old. 
</P>
<P>
The East Germans set meet records Sunday night in the men's and women's 
1500-meter freestyles. Grit Muller touched first in the women's race in 16 
minutes, 36.91 seconds, and Joerg Hoffman won his third event in 15:41.56. East 
German men won every individual event Sunday as Christian Gessner won the men's 
200 individual medley in 2:05.48 and Tino Weber took the 200 backstroke in 
2:03.31, both meet record times. Ingolf Rasch spoiled the return of U.S. 
Olympic silver medalist Chris Jacobs in the 100 freestyle as he touched in 
52.72, .29 seconds ahead of Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
Another Olympian, Erika Hansen, kept the East Germans from a Sunday sweep, 
winning the 200 individual medley in 2:19.37 with Nicole Haislett, of St. 
Petersburg, Fla., second in 2:21.35. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Olympian Doug Gjertsen and Hansen were the high point winners of the meet, 
Gjertsen earning 107 points and Hansen 143.

$3.80 and $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
Feel The Beat, ridden by Chris Antley, led until Mistaurian's move and was 
three-quarters of a length ahead of favorite Fantastic Find under Craig Perret 
in the field of five. Spotty Hot and Wonchindordor were the trailers. 
</P>
<P>
Mistaurian, owned by Bernard Chaus, covered seven furlongs on a fast track in 
1:25 1/5. Her third victory in six starts this year was worth $50,040. 
</P>
<P>
Jockey Rick Moss suffered an ankle injury when his mount, Phoenix Sunshine, 
stumbled and fell, causing two other horses to go down during the $109,900 
Locust Grove at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
Dibs, with Aaron Gryder aboard, was well outside the pileup and drew off for a 
two-length victory over City Crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Dibs covered the 1 1/8 miles over the turf in 1:50 3/5 and paid $15.80, $5.60 
and $2.80. 
</P>
<P>
Clever Trevor, ridden by Don Pettinger, made his turf debut a successful one at 
Arlington International Racecourse, winning a $28,000 allowance race over one 
mile in 1:36.1. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the second in a row this year for Clever Trevor and increased 
his lifetime record to 12 victories in 19 starts. He has earned $1.05 million.

<P>
OTHER RACES: AFTER THREE DISAPPOINTING EFFORTS, GELDING GOES WIRE-TO-WIRE IN 
$156,000 HOLLYWOOD PARK RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Trainer John Sadler didn't need his ace to win the $156,600 Hollywood Park 
Budweiser Breeders' Cup Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
With Olympic Prospect, who won the first running of the event two years 
earlier, sitting this one out, Frost Free went wire-to-wire, holding off 
Coastal Voyage and favored Sam Who. 
</P>
<P>
After disappointing in his previous three races, the 5-year-old It's Freezing 
gelding broke on top under Gary Stevens, relaxed well on the lead and had 
enough left to win in 1:08 1/5 for the six furlongs on turf. 
</P>
<P>
After capturing his first two starts of 1990, Frost Free had finished fifth as 
the 8-5 favorite in his initial try on the turf, the Sierra Madre Handicap 
March 21 at Santa Anita, then was fourth in both the Triple Bend Handicap and 
Golden Gate's Oakland Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Sadler felt he had excuses for those three races and he was encouraged by Frost 
Free's recent works. He worked five furlongs on the grass in :59 3/5 June 14, 
then blew out a half-mile in 46 flat last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason I thought he could handle this turf course is that it's so much 
different than Santa Anita's," said Sadler after Frost Free's $17.80 upset. 
"This is a very firm course. Santa Anita's is a lot looser, especially coming 
down the hill. 
</P>
<P>
"Speed also had been looking very good on it this week and the main thing is I 
wanted a track he could get a hold of. 
</P>
<P>
"He couldn't handle the track at all at Golden Gate (May 28). It was really 
slow. He's perfect in the slop, but that was a heavy, drying out track. It was 
very, very deep and he couldn't handle it." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, the return to Stevens was also a factor. The rider is now unbeaten in 
five collaborations with Frost Free. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the quickest gate horses I've ridden, so I felt pretty confident 
I'd be on the lead," he said. "It was just a super race. He did everything 
right. I still think he's a little better on the dirt than he is on the turf. 
He handled it well today, but he bobbled a few times on the turn. He's all 
fight." 
</P>
<P>
Coastal Voyage, the 5-2 second choice, was a nose better than Sam Who, the 
beaten favorite in his first two starts of the year. He lacked room briefly on 
the turn, but Laffit Pincay had no excuses for the Lypheor gelding. 
</P>
<P>
Round Sovereign was fourth, then came Major Current, Pentelicus, Ofanto, 
Weldnaas, Colway Rally, Wonder Dancer and Somormujo. 
</P>
<P>
The Gold Cup wasn't the only stakes success for Wayne Lukas Sunday at Hollywood 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Two races before, he was in the winner's circle after the $106,500 Princess 
Stakes, which was hardly a shock. After all, he saddled three of the five 
entrants. 
</P>
<P>
What was surprising was which 3-year-old filly was standing there with him. A 
Wild Ride, a 9-1 shot, rallied from last to beat Golden Reef and her two more 
highly-regarded stablemates, Patches and Hail Atlantis. 
</P>
<P>
Winless since beating Dominant Dancer in the Junior Miss Stakes last August at 
Del Mar, A Wild Ride was last for the first six furlongs under Jose Santos, 
rallied along the rail, collared pacesetter Golden Reef with less than a 
sixteenth of a mile and was drawing away at the finish. The official margin was 
two lengths and she completed the 1 1/16 miles in 1:42 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth, third and second in three sprint starts this year, A Wild Ride made it 
a double for Calumet Farm, which also owns Criminal Type. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it might get a little hot up front, so I told Jose to be patient," 
said Lukas, who seemed genuinely startled at the outcome. "I thought he rode a 
real heady race because they were smokin' pretty good. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a sneaking hunch that (Golden Reef) might go and that left Jose as the 
only late-runner and that's the way it came out." 
</P>
<P>
In her first try around two turns, Golden Reef, the 3-1 third choice, looked 
like a winner most of the way, but she weakened in the final furlong. 
</P>
<P>
"She was very relaxed, but she was trying to get out with me all the way," said 
Eddie Delahoussaye. "He (trainer Chris Speckert) might try her in blinkers next 
time."

Mattel Sues Cult Leader: The Hawthorne-based toy maker sued religious cult 
leader Tony Alamo and two of his companies, claiming that they have damaged the 
images of Mattel and Barbie. The breach-of-contract case, filed in Los Angeles 
Superior Court, said Alamo Designs in early 1989 obtained two licenses to make 
and sell denim jackets, T-shirts and jeans decorated with rhinestones and the 
name and likeness of Barbie and Nostalgic Barbie. 
</P>
<P>
The suit said the agreements were violated because Alamo, among other things, 
marketed an unapproved T-shirt with a "religious symbol," called Pope John Paul 
II a "Nazi war criminal" and has been evading arrest for felony child abuse. 
The suit seeks more than $75,000 and an order barring Alamo from using Barbie 
images or trademarks. (Filed June 21, 1990. Case No. BC004015)

JAPANESE CRITIC SAYS U.S. HOLDS TRADE-GAP KEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Shintaro Ishihara, author of the controversial book "The Japan That Can Say 
No," has presented his own 109 demands for American economic reform and warned 
that opening the Japanese market, by itself, would not eliminate the trade 
imbalance between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
Ishihara told foreign correspondents Friday that he agrees with U.S. 
negotiators who are demanding that Japan dramatically increase spending on 
public works to improve living standards and pull in imports. Japan's closed 
markets should also be opened to give Japanese consumers a better life, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
But he said that whatever reforms Japan promises to undertake in the yearlong 
Structural Impediments Initiative talks won't be enough, by themselves, to 
reduce the United States's $49-billion trade imbalance with Japan. The 
negotiations are designed to remove trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States must regain its competitiveness and make products in America 
that will sell. . . . The United States conducts 10 times the basic research, 
which is the foundation of technology, that Japan does but cannot turn that 
research into products. That is the fault of management," Ishihara said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's also a fault of the U.S. political system. . . . The U.S. government must 
get more involved.' 
</P>
<P>
Ishihara, known as a gadfly within Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, 
said the LDP, preferring to "leave everything to the bureaucrats," had snubbed 
his list of proposed American reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The novelist-turned-politician attracted wide attention last summer when "The 
Japan That Can Say No," a book he co-authored with Sony Chairman Akio Morita, 
was translated into English without his permission. In the book, which stirred 
widespread resentment in Congress, he advocated that Japan use its 
technological prowess as a diplomatic weapon. 
</P>
<P>
A sequel, written without Morita, called "Nevertheless, Japan Can Still Say 
No," is No. 1 on the Asahi newspaper's list of best-selling business books. 
</P>
<P>
American and Japanese negotiators will meet here today and Tuesday to work on a 
final report on the Structural Impediments Initiative talks, which President 
Bush has made the focus of his economic policy toward Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Ishihara pointed out Friday that American proposals for rejuvenating U.S. 
industry -- the latest is "Made in America," by the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology -- have been coming out one after another for more than five years. 
"But the U.S. Administration and Congress have done nothing to implement them," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese proposals in the SII talks for American reforms, he complained, have 
been too moderate and lacked specifics. 
</P>
<P>
Ishihara suggested that the United States spend 5% of its gross national 
product on education, carry out an "action program" to reduce consumption, 
enact a national sales tax and offer broad tax exemptions on personal savings 
-- similar to those that Japan abandoned in April, 1988, to promote 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that the United States is demanding that Japanese banks operate their 
automated teller machines 24 hours a day to promote consumption, Ishihara said 
ATM operations in the United States should be curtailed to 12 hours a day to 
restrain consumption. 
</P>
<P>
He also called for "dramatic" cuts in American nuclear weaponry and overseas 
bases.

Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Sues Insurer: The ad agency sued New Hampshire Insurance 
Co. for refusing to pay for its defense in a number of investor lawsuits 
pending in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Superior Court suit said New Hampshire Insurance issued a 
directors and officers liability policy, agreeing to indemnify them against 
most legal claims. The suits, filed by holders of Saatchi's American depositary 
receipts, claim that Saatchi artificially pumped up the price of the receipts 
and did not reveal its problems in absorbing a number of acquisitions. 
Saatchi's suit seeks more than $100,000 and a court order that New Hampshire 
must pay to defend the investor suits. (Filed June 19, 1990. Case No. BC003822)

Conair Wins Court Ruling: A Los Angeles Superior Court judge refused to order 
Conair Corp. to turn over molds and tools to manufacture curling irons. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling came in a Los Angeles Superior Court suit by Styling Research Co. of 
Canoga Park, which claims that Conair agreed to make and deliver the products 
that Styling says it needs to fill its wholesale orders and continue in 
business. Styling's lawyer, Andrew Hunter, said the company will pursue the 
case in Hong Kong, where the equipment is located. Conair has declined to turn 
over the tools until Styling pays "a few thousand dollars" of overdue shipping 
costs, Hunter said. (Filed June 18, 1990. Case No. BC003704.)

THE FISCHBACH CURSE CLAIMS ANOTHER VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN SLOAN, ALLAN SLOAN is a financial columnist for Newsday in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If there ever was a company with a curse on it, it has to be Fischbach Corp., 
the New York-based electrical contracting company. Not only has Fischbach 
itself been devastated by the takeover shenanigans of the 1980s, but so have 
the key players involved in the 1985 takeover of the company by Victor Posner, 
corporate carnivore and convicted felon. 
</P>
<P>
And now, yet another victim seems to be spattered by the mud that seems to 
besmirch everyone who comes near Fischbach: American International Group, and 
its chairman, Maurice (Hank) Greenberg. AIG, a huge, successful insurance 
holding company, is buying Fischbach for $11 a share. Greenberg is one of the 
most respected and astute executives in the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
The AIG takeover of Fischbach is a very unusual transaction, to say the least. 
AIG is buying Fischbach for $44 million, stuffing some of Fischbach's 
operations and Fischbach's new business into a company to be managed and 51% 
owned by Peter Kiewit Sons Inc. of Omaha and keeping some existing Fischbach 
business and other assets. If you have trouble grasping this, join the club. 
You don't see $44-million deals this complicated every day. Thank God. 
</P>
<P>
Let me stress that Greenberg's Fischbach problem isn't remotely comparable to 
those of the other people who have been tarred by Fischbach: Ivan F. Boesky, 
Michael Milken, Drexel Burnham Lambert and Posner. 
</P>
<P>
These players have big, big legal problems; all but Posner copped guilty pleas 
to securities fraud involving Fischbach. Posner, who pleaded guilty to criminal 
tax fraud in an unrelated case, faces possible indictment. Plus, as you may 
recall, all these players lost money in the Fischbach follies. 
</P>
<P>
AIG and Greenberg don't have any legal problem that I can see. But I think that 
a company with AIG's reputation ought to disclose certain facts, unpleasant as 
they may be, and ought to engage in open dealing with Fischbach's shareholders. 
Not to mention AIG's. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't get Greenberg to talk to me. AIG -- in the form of John Wooster Jr., 
vice president of communications -- says it doesn't see any problem. 
</P>
<P>
Let me tell you what's going on, and you can draw your own conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
AIG says it's buying Fischbach to protect itself against losses in the $500 
million of construction surety bonding that it has outstanding to Fischbach. 
This bonding guarantees Fischbach's customers that money will be available to 
finish a job if Fischbach can't or doesn't complete it. No bonding, no new 
business. 
</P>
<P>
After Posner took over Fischbach in 1985, its bonding company, a subsidiary of 
Chubb, resigned the account. It didn't want to do business with a company 
controlled by Posner, who has a well-deserved reputation for taking excessive 
salaries and for putting his personal interests ahead of the interest of his 
companies' employees, customers, vendors and stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
Many, if not most, of the major bonding companies also refused to do business 
with Posner-controlled Fischbach. 
</P>
<P>
AIG took over the business in 1986. Guess what. It's having so much trouble 
getting paid that it had to take out second mortgages on Fischbach properties 
to ensure payment of more than $20 million of past-due premiums, ad to lend 
Fischbach money to keep it afloat -- and now has to go through a complicated 
and expensive takeover of its client to protect itself against losses on the 
policies that the client took out. 
</P>
<P>
And Fischbach, it turns out, isn't just any piece of insurance business. It was 
business brought to AIG by Mel Harris, an insurance broker at Alexander &amp; 
Alexander in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, a big producer at A&amp;A, is related to Greenberg's wife -- they're 
cousins -- and socializes with Greenberg. 
</P>
<P>
Harris says that, despite his relationship with the Greenbergs, none of his 
business -- including the Fischbach business -- got any special treatment from 
AIG's underwriters. "Being a cousin of Mrs. Greenberg is not of any value when 
you are dealing with the surety department of AIG," Harris said wryly. 
</P>
<P>
Harris' statement notwithstanding, the Harris-Greenberg relationship strikes me 
as a piece of information that I would like to have if I owned stock in either 
Fischbach or AIG. To me, it looks bad not to have disclosed this relationship, 
because it looks like AIG is hiding something. I also would be curious whether 
AIG has gotten Alexander &amp; Alexander to bear part of AIG's effort and 
expense in tending to the Fischbach account. 
</P>
<P>
AIG's answer: There is no legal requirement to disclose any of this. And AIG PR 
man Wooster asserts that the Fischbach business was treated by AIG the way 
similar business is treated. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure. 
</P>
<P>
When I asked Wooster how many other times AIG has had to spend more than $40 
million to buy a customer to protect itself against insurance losses, he said 
that question was outside the Fischbach transaction, and he wouldn't answer it. 
</P>
<P>
Once upon a time, Fischbach was a proud, productive and profitable company that 
helped build electric generating plants, trash-to-energy plants and other 
facilities that society needs. Thanks to the fancy and illegal dancing that 
went on, the company and the people who helped Posner buy it were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
After this deal goes through, there probably will be plenty of Fischbach 
employees' blood on the streets as Kiewit slashes the work force. When that's 
over, though, there is a reasonable chance that Fischbach, in its Kiewit-AIG 
incarnation, will be proud, productive and profitable again. 
</P>
<P>
It's a pity, though, that a once-fine company that has been under a cloud for 
so many years is losing its independence under a cloud. But, given the 
Fischbach Curse, it was probably to be expected.

The trust departments of banks, traditionally the venue of the rich if not the 
famous, may be about to become accessible to the merely prosperous -- a 
prospect that has the mutual fund industry crying foul. 
</P>
<P>
Under regulations proposed by federal bank regulators, national banks would be 
able to start advertising trust accounts and charging fees in whatever way 
state laws permit. By setting up trusts in a way that will appeal to small 
investors and promoting them to the public, banks would be able to market them 
to people looking for an investment vehicle, according to opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The effect, according to these critics, would be to subordinate the traditional 
trust aspects of these accounts and put banks into the mutual fund business. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposed rule represents a frontal assault" on congressional restrictions 
on banks' activities in the area of stocks, bonds and other securities, said a 
letter from the Investment Company Institute, a mutual-fund trade group, 
commenting on the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
The rules offer the potential for a new competitor in the money-management 
field, one that could offer convenience, efficiency and, based on past 
performance, outstanding investment value. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, the rules raise the possibility that confused 
investors, as happened with the failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn., will 
think that they are putting their money into a federally insured deposit when 
they are not. 
</P>
<P>
The rules have been proposed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, 
an agency of the Treasury Department that regulates national banks. The OCC is 
accepting public comments on the issue until July 7 and will then consider 
whether to make the regulations final. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal has stirred widespread concern on Capitol Hill. Members ranging 
from House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) to House 
Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) have written 
to the regulators expressing concern. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and several other members criticized the 
"granting of Lincoln-type securities powers, with no corresponding safeguards." 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1930s, the Glass-Steagall Act and other laws have sharply restricted 
bank activities outside their traditional businesses of taking deposits and 
making loans. But banks argue that these restrictions are obsolete and hamper 
their efforts to compete effectively with giant foreign banks. Many bankers 
would like to get into not only the mutual fund business but also insurance and 
securities generally. 
</P>
<P>
The OCC's proposal does not sit well with members of Congress, who view it as 
an end run. 
</P>
<P>
With questions about the solvency of bank deposit insurance funds and the 
experience with savings and loans, "Why would you do anything that would add 
risk?" asked one congressional staff member familiar with the issue. "It just 
makes no sense." 
</P>
<P>
Another staffer noted that although trust accounts are not insured, "if these 
things run amok, are we exposing the deposit insurance fund to a huge 
liability?" 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the OCC said, however, that the rules changes are not that 
dramatic and do no more than put national banks "on a par with state banks," 
many of which already have these powers. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the rules are so-called common trusts, which are investment pools 
operated by banks so that they can manage relatively small trust accounts 
efficiently. If a trust account is large enough, it can be managed as a 
separate entity, but smaller sums would be eaten up by fees if handled 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, regulators have for many years allowed banks to pool smaller trust 
accounts and manage them together. 
</P>
<P>
But trust accounts are more than simple investment vehicles. They involve a 
fiduciary relationship that requires the bank to manage the money prudently and 
with only the interests of the beneficiary in mind, much as the trustees of a 
pension fund must watch over investments on behalf of current and future 
pensioners. 
</P>
<P>
The new rules would leave most regulation of these funds to the states, which 
opponents see as tantamount to no regulation at all. 
</P>
<P>
"The proposed rule is intended to convert bank common trust funds from 
administrative devices into mutual fund vehicles used to sell collective 
money-management services to the public for a profit," the Investment Company 
Institute letter charges. 
</P>
<P>
Some small banks oppose the rules, but other small banks and most big banks 
want the change. And they dispute the ICI's charges. 
</P>
<P>
"I only wish (the proposed rules) would let us into the mutual fund business 
because we want to be in the mutual fund business, but this isn't the vehicle 
for it," said James D. McLaughlin of the American Bankers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Marketing common trust services "to the masses" would bring banks afoul of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, he said.

GERMAN ISSUES: EXPECT PAYOFF MUCH LATER

<P>
The West German stock market has suddenly come back to life after a dismal 
spring. That's stirring new interest in the market on the part of U.S. 
investors, who are remembering all those post-Berlin Wall stories about the 
united Germany's dynamic future as the economic leader of the "new Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Should you have money invested in German stocks? Yes, most global market 
strategists will tell you. Will you have to wait awhile for your payoff? Most 
likely, yes. But to try and time the turn of events in Germany would probably 
be futile. When that market moves, it moves very quickly. 
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, the West German market was the world's 
hottest. From January 1 to April 2, the Frankfurt exchange's 30-share DAX index 
rose 10%, to 1,976.43. In the same period, the U.S. market fell 3.4% and 
Japan's plunged 26%. 
</P>
<P>
But just as the U.S. and Japanese markets rebounded in the spring, Germany's 
stagnated. Steve Keddell, who handles big U.S. investors' trades of German 
stocks for Deutsche Bank in New York, notes that the German market was hit by a 
number of problems at once: concerns about the cost of unification; rising 
interest rates; a strong Deutschemark, which hurt export profits, and turmoil 
in Brazil, a big market for German firms. 
</P>
<P>
Those problems sent the DAX down to 1,787.39 by June 13. Then, last week, 
buyers returned, boosting the DAX 80.66 points for the week to 1,872.92 on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Is this the start of a new surge? That's probably up to American and Japanese 
investors. Because the German stock market is relatively small, "in the short 
term, what drives German stocks is the action of outsiders" who suddenly throw 
large sums at the stocks, says George Murnaghan. He runs two international 
stock mutual funds for T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Some American investors believe that relief over the economic cementing of East 
Germany with the West on July 2 -- via East Germany's conversion to West 
Germany's currency -- could precipitate a flood of money into German stocks. 
"The market could rebound violently," says Frank Jennings, who runs American 
International Group's $500-million international investment portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, German stocks don't appear overpriced. Keddell says the average 
stock on the Frankfurt exchange sells for 14 times estimated 1990 earnings per 
share, about on par with U.S. stocks and well below Japan's still-lofty 
price/earnings ratios. 
</P>
<P>
The big question now is whether West German companies will be able to show 
decent profit growth this year and next. Keddell admits that his expectations 
are coming down. "We originally expected 12% (average) earnings growth this 
year, but we now see 9%," he says. And for 1991, he sees just 7%. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that no one knows what West German companies will have to invest 
to revitalize their East German counterparts, as unification proceeds. There is 
a growing realization, however, that "these companies will have to spend a lot 
of money before they can earn anything," Keddell says. 
</P>
<P>
George Noble, one of Fidelity Group's key international stock managers, toured 
the two Germanys earlier this month. He returned to the United States sobered 
about chances of a fast payoff from unification. In fact, Noble cut back a bit 
on his Overseas Fund's position in German stocks. 
</P>
<P>
The East German economy is a shambles, he says. Its plants are grossly 
inefficient. Officials at a West German auto parts plant told Noble about an 
Eastern counterpart that employs 800 people. The Western plant produces as much 
with 150. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows there's a huge bill that the West Germans will have to pay to 
rebuild the East. The German stock market may even be prepared for little or no 
earnings growth by German firms this year and next, as capital spending soars. 
The big unknown, says Noble, is whether social upheaval in the East will lead 
to rioting. That could panic foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you're going to see unemployment be a real problem," he says. Add the 
potential for interest rates to remain high -- as the two Germanys borrow 
massively to fund unification -- and Noble believes German stocks could slide 
further this year. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond the short-term gloom, he says he is convinced that the German market 
could one day be the world's best -- because German economic power is certain 
to be pre-eminent in Europe. If you think you can time the market, good luck. 
The smartest investors will probably put money into German stocks this year, 
and vow not to touch them for three years minimum.

investments in that market:

DR. NEIL SOLOMON: LISTING OILS IN FOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I sometimes see labels on food packages that list a number of 
different kinds of oil that may be present in the product, but it doesn't say 
which particular one is used. Are food manufacturers permitted to do this? 
Reading the label doesn't do much good if I still don't know what the food 
contains. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Food and Drug Administration regulations permit manufacturers to list a 
number of oils that may be contained in a food when the oil is not the major 
ingredient. The manufacturer thus has the freedom to use a different oil at 
different times. However, for foods in which oil is the major ingredient, the 
manufacturer must list it by its common name, such as lard or coconut oil.

MANY SEPTIC TANK USERS STILL PAYING SEWER FEES; 
</P>
<P>
UTILITY: SEVERAL PACOIMA FAMILIES FILE CLAIMS WITH THE CITY. BUT OFFICIALS SAY 
THAT EVEN IF REFUNDS ARE GRANTED, THEY WILL BE FOR 12 MONTHS ONLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hundreds, and possibly thousands, of mostly low-income Los Angeles residents 
whose homes are connected to septic tanks have been paying more than $100 
annually in sewer fees for as long as 12 years because they are unaware that 
they must ask the city to stop billing them. 
</P>
<P>
The residents, many of them immigrants who speak little or no English, 
apparently have not noticed or do not understand annual English-only water bill 
inserts explaining how to be exempted from sewer fees, city officials 
acknowledge. Otherwise, the fees -- averaging $10.43 per month for a 
single-family dwelling -- are billed to water customers automatically. 
</P>
<P>
Even if an exemption is granted, the city will refund charges only for the 12 
months preceding the date it was requested, officials said. Thus, a septic tank 
user who unwittingly has been paying the fees since Los Angeles began assessing 
them to residential customers in 1978 could have forfeited hundreds of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the city is robbing me -- just like in Mexico," said Pedro 
Velasquez, a Pacoima gardener who estimates he has paid about $600 in sewer 
fees since buying his home in 1985. He learned in January that he was entitled 
to an exemption. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, lawyers with San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal Services filed a 
claim with the city on behalf of Velasquez and seven other Pacoima residents 
seeking reimbursement for unwarranted sewer fees. The claimant who has paid the 
fees the longest, Robert Alvarez, bought his home on Brownell Street in 1981 
and has never been hooked up to the sewer. 
</P>
<P>
The problem arises because the city charges sewer fees to water customers based 
on the amount of water consumed, on the theory that a portion of the water ends 
up in the sewage system. 
</P>
<P>
But the city does not know which water customers are connected to sewers 
because parcel maps showing sewer connections are often outdated or inaccurate, 
said Fred Hoeptner, a senior civil engineer with the Los Angeles Department of 
Public Works waste water management division. 
</P>
<P>
The city would have to send inspectors to each of the 733,380 parcels in Los 
Angeles to determine which are on the sewer system, he said. Until such a count 
is made, the city will continue to bill septic tank users for sewer service 
unless they seek an exemption, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Public Works officials estimate that there are 590,000 sewer 
hookups and that 3% of the city's residents live in dwellings served by septic 
tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Nakamura, the attorney who filed the claim with the city, said many 
low-income renters who pay their own water bills might not know whether the 
property has a septic tank or sewer service and are continuing to pay the fees. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Nakamura nor city officials could estimate how many people qualify for 
the exemptions but have not asked for them. 
</P>
<P>
The claim submitted on behalf of the eight Pacoima residents, who live along a 
stretch of Brownell Street that has no sewer access, says the current billing 
system violates state unfair business-practice and other laws. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who represents the northeast 
Valley, said he agrees that the billing system should be changed. "I think 
administratively it's easier, but whether it's fair or not is another 
question," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The residents intend to sue the city if the claim is denied, a result that 
Nakamura said is likely. Nakamura said the lawsuit would contend that the city 
intentionally misled customers and that the plaintiffs were falsely led to 
believe the fee was appropriate because public agencies are expected to obey 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
The claim filed Friday grew out of an unsuccessful effort by Brownell Street 
resident Esteban Gallardo, 46, to obtain a sewer-fee exemption. According to 
Gallardo, the Department of Water and Power threatened to cut off water to his 
house, which he has rented since 1986, if he refused to pay the fee. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, Gallardo mentioned the problem to neighbor Graciela Lopez, who 
advised him to contact the legal-aid organization. 
</P>
<P>
After Nakamura and other legal-aid attorneys heard Gallardo's story, they 
knocked on doors in the man's neighborhood to see if others had the same 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Like Gallardo, who is unemployed and on welfare, many of the claimants are poor 
and speak little or no English. Many of them rent the small, ranch-style houses 
whose loosely tended front yards are marked by square, wood septic tank lids. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Deputy City Atty. John Haggerty, who represents the Department of 
Public Works, denied that the city has violated any laws. He said the city code 
clearly states that residents may seek only a year's worth of damages when 
making claims. 
</P>
<P>
But for the residents of Brownell Street who are seeking refunds, there was 
nothing proper about the way their money ended up in city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know until January" that the sewer fees were not required, said 
Margarita Velasquez, 17, Pedro Velasquez's daughter. "We were very upset. They 
were charging us for something we didn't have."

STOCKPILE OF ONE'S OWN BLOOD IS THE SAFEST OPTION WHEN FACING SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reprinted from the July issue of the Johns Hopkins Medical Letter 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone preparing for elective surgery who may need a blood transfusion should 
look into stockpiling his own blood. The case for self-donated, or autologous, 
blood is simple: Because it carries no risk of infection, your own blood is the 
safest blood you can get. 
</P>
<P>
However, while the American Medical Assn., the American Red Cross, and the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) all recommend the use of autologous blood, only a 
minority of the 18 million transfusions performed annually are self-donated -- 
largely because too few patients are informed of this valuable alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Autologous blood donation started to gain popularity several years back, 
primarily because of the risk of being infected with the AIDS-causing HIV virus 
during transfusion. 
</P>
<P>
This risk has faded since a screening test for HIV, introduced in 1985, greatly 
reduced the possibility of receiving AIDS-contaminated blood. Your chances of 
contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion fall somewhere between 1 in 75,000 to 
1 in 500,000 per unit of blood, depending on whether blood comes from an area 
with high or low incidence of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
More effective screening methods continue to lessen the risk of acquiring 
illness from a transfusion using donor (homologous) blood. Just this past May, 
the FDA approved a test to screen donor blood for hepatitis C, also called non 
A/non B hepatitis. (Since earlier screens had reduced contamination from 
hepatitis B, hepatitis C has been responsible for 90% transfusion-acquired 
hepatitis.) 
</P>
<P>
However, recent research suggests that donor transfusions may suppress the 
immune system, increasing the risk of postsurgical infection. One study, 
presented at a recent meeting of the American Assn. of Blood Banks, followed 
the postsurgical infection rates of 105 hip replacement patients. 
</P>
<P>
None of those in either the transfusion-free or autologously transfused groups 
acquired any infection, while 23% of the homologously transfused patients did. 
It seems that autologous blood -- which naturally poses no threat to your 
immune system -- allows the immune system to place its energies into getting 
you well rather than fighting suspicious foreign blood particles. 
</P>
<P>
One deterrent of autologous donation is that, despite iron supplementation, 
many donors become anemic before an adequate amount of blood is stored because 
their body does not replace the depleted red blood cell (RBC) supply fast 
enough. On average, an "adequate supply" usually requires that three to four 
pints of "units" be donated in the month before surgery. (Fully stocked, the 
body's blood supply is about 9.5 pints.) 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, new genetic technology may make it easier to store that much 
blood. A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found 
that the anemia was the result of insufficient levels of the hormone 
erythropoietin, or EPO. Produced by the kidneys in response to a decrease in 
RBCs, EPC acts as a red flag and alerts bone marrow to produce more RBCs. 
</P>
<P>
This multicenter study showed that administering genetically manufactured EPO 
intravenously allowed 96% of patients treated to store enough blood without 
becoming anemic. 
</P>
<P>
The down side: At the moment, treatment costs are high -- about $2,500 a 
patient -- and, because the procedure is still investigational, insurance 
companies have not yet established a policy on reimbursement. Other ongoing 
studies are examining the effects of lower-dose therapy, which should bring 
costs down. 
</P>
<P>
When autologous donations are not an option, as in an emergency or in 
operations such as open-heart surgery that involve massive blood loss, another 
option for utilizing your own blood is a technique known as intraoperative 
autologous transfusion (IAT). In this procedure, blood lost during the surgery 
is collected and recycled through a machine that filters and cleans it, and 
then feeds it back into your circulatory system. However, because of the 
possibility of contamination, intraoperative transfusions are not used for 
open-bowel surgeries, cancer operations, or cases where there is an infection 
at the site of the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
A well-marketed option -- donating your blood now, and then freezing and 
storing it for possible later use -- is definitely not good transfusion 
insurance. One obstacle is the cost: Red Cross and hospital blood banks do not 
have enough storage space to hold frozen blood indefinitely, and commercial 
blood banks charge up to $275 a unit. 
</P>
<P>
Transport is another problem: If you need blood in an emergency and are not 
near your stored supply, considerable expense is incurred in shipment, and the 
blood, which will take 90 minutes to thaw once your surgeon has it, might very 
well not get to you in time anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Once thawed, blood must be discarded after 24 hours -- and after three years of 
storage in the freezer, it must be discarded whether it is used or not. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, a homologous transfusion is unavoidable. "While autologous 
transfusions are the only way to guarantee 100% transfusion safety, and should 
always be encouraged," said Dr. Paul Ness, director of the Johns Hopkins Blood 
Bank, "if you do need blood, the homologous blood supply has never been safer." 
</P>
<P>
If you are scheduled for elective surgery that might require a blood 
transfusion, make every effort to donate autologously. Even if you are able to 
make only a partial donation, that will minimize the amount of blood needed 
from the donor pool and so may cut your transfusion risk. 
</P>
<P>
Donating autologously might mean extra footwork -- not all hospitals collect 
autologously, but most area blood centers will -- and extra cost (more tracking 
and paper work add an average of $40 a unit to the bill, which not all 
insurance companies will cover). However, improved safety may far outweigh 
these considerations. 
</P>
<P>
DONATING BLOOD TO YOURSELF 
</P>
<P>
* Different surgeries require different amounts: When discussing elective 
surgery with your doctor, ask if you are likely to need a transfusion, and how 
much blood your surgery typically requires. 
</P>
<P>
Some surgeries that commonly require transfusions: open heart surgery (up to 6 
units); orthopedic surgery (2 to 4 units); gynecological surgery (around 2 
units). 
</P>
<P>
* Schedule far in advance: Try to schedule your surgery far enough in advance 
-- usually a month to six weeks -- so that you will have time to stockpile 
enough blood. Usually, you can donate one to two units of blood per week for up 
to four to five weeks before surgery. (Blood can be stored for 42 days.) 
</P>
<P>
To allow your body time to replenish its own blood volume for the surgery, you 
should not donate blood during the three days prior to the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
* Find out the location for donations: Ask your doctor where to make the 
donations -- usually a donor room at your hospital, or a local blood donor 
center -- and call and schedule your appointments. Ask the doctor if you should 
take iron supplements to help you avoid anemia.

PSYCHOLOGY: EACH YEAR ABOUT 100,000 AMERICANS ARE DIAGNOSED AS SCHIZOPHRENIC.

At a conference titled "What Is Schizophrenia?" held here earlier this month, 
the first speaker paused at the podium to ask for the next slide, which he said 
would show a list of "established facts" about the disorder. Instead, the 
screen suddenly went blank, prompting wry laughter to ripple through the 
auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
Just what has been "established" about schizophrenia was the subject of serious 
and sometimes sharp-edged discussions during this two-day gathering, which took 
place nearly 80 years after the term was coined by the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen 
Bleuler. 
</P>
<P>
Each year about 100,000 Americans are newly diagnosed as schizophrenic, which 
means that they are said to believe things that aren't true, to see or hear 
things that aren't there, to have disorganized thoughts and speech, to exhibit 
various disturbances of emotion and to withdraw from others. Most people we 
think of as "crazy" or "demented" are likely to be diagnosed as schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
But here at Clark University, where Freud gave a famous lecture in 1909, 16 
psychiatrists, psychologists, philosophers and social scientists gathered to 
debate whether schizophrenia is actually a disease and whether it has a 
biological basis. 
</P>
<P>
Challenging the conventional wisdom in the field, some participants proposed 
that the disorder actually does not meet the criteria for a disease. They also 
charged their colleagues with giving short shrift to environmental factors that 
lead to a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The mavericks in the field of mental 
health even questioned whether the word "schizophrenia" is meaningful or 
useful. 
</P>
<P>
"What is the 'it' we talk about as schizophrenia?" psychologist Morton Wiener, 
a co-host of the conference, asked his colleagues. "We talk about outcome and 
we talk about effects, but what's the animal itself?" 
</P>
<P>
The animal may be a unicorn, argued Theodore Sarbin, professor emeritus of 
psychology at UC Santa Cruz. "Schizophrenia is a social construction to deal 
with people whose conduct is unacceptable to" those in positions of power, he 
said. "My recommendation is that we banish the term to the musty historical 
archives." 
</P>
<P>
"In the 1930s, I might have believed you," retorted psychiatrist Joseph Zubin, 
an influential researcher in the field. "In 1990, what you say is complete 
nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the controversy results from the slipperiness of the diagnosis. In a 
paper presented at the start of the conference, Manfred Bleuler, Eugen's son, 
observed that two people who are both classified as schizophrenic may have very 
different sets of symptoms -- and many of these features may be shared by 
people regarded as normal. These are facts, he noted, "which it would be 
pleasant to forget." 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrists who define and refine the diagnostic category of schizophrenia 
often have trouble agreeing among themselves about such things as whether a 
given delusion (a false belief) qualifies as "bizarre." This was conceded by 
Thomas McGlashan, who sits on the committee now preparing the fourth version of 
the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual, the practitioner's handbook. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in an interview, he acknowledged that the list of diagnostic criteria 
for schizophrenia resembles "a Chinese menu and you see that there's something 
arbitrary about it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Zubin and others insisted that psychiatrists are making progress in 
establishing a systematic procedure for understanding and diagnosing the 
disorder, which they refer to as a disease. "It's a line of reasoning that will 
eventually lead to something, even if the word schizophrenia doesn't last 
forever," said Paul McHugh, who heads the department of psychiatry at Johns 
Hopkins medical school. 
</P>
<P>
Yet McHugh admitted that "schizophrenia is difficult to describe and define 
even as a clinical concept" -- partly because no one knows why people act in 
ways that lead to that diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
Most psychiatrists now believe that some neuro-biological problem is 
responsible, but several conference participants warned about relying too 
heavily on such theories. "Scientists have been too facile in invoking biology 
to explain schizophrenia," argued Robert Carson, a Duke University psychologist 
who has written widely on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, he said, has a lot to do with what kind of research gets funded. 
The National Institute of Mental Health, which hands out about 85% of all money 
used to study mental disorders, tends to pay for people to look at brains 
rather than at families, to emphasize genetic rather than cultural factors. 
</P>
<P>
"Biological psychiatry is very much in the saddle, particularly with respect to 
funding," Carson said. "The best way to get money from a politician is to say, 
'Give me five more years and we'll lick schizophrenia because it's a genetic 
disease.' But we'll never have a miracle cure because schizophrenia is too 
involved with the whole life of the person." 
</P>
<P>
Watching schizophrenics whose symptoms come and go, largely in response to what 
is happening around them, has led Yale psychiatrist John Strauss to repudiate 
"metaphors like 'the broken brain.' " Strauss described how a raving paranoid 
schizophrenic used to beat him at chess, proving that he could calm down and 
think clearly when the situation called for it. 
</P>
<P>
The story is also told of a psychiatrist who had to examine a catatonic 
schizophrenic in order to pass an examination. The patient sat frozen, ignoring 
all questions, until the psychiatrist finally got down on the floor with him 
and shouted, "Look, I'm going to flunk this exam unless you say something" -- 
whereupon the patient began to speak. 
</P>
<P>
In short, therapists need to see "the patient as a goal-directed being who's 
trying to solve problems" rather than as someone simply "suffering from 
happenings in the brain," Sarbin said. 
</P>
<P>
Even critics of mainstream psychiatry tend to agree that genetic predisposition 
plays some role in determining who becomes schizophrenic. But the studies of 
twins that led to this conclusion have been severely criticized. "They're so 
full of errors as to be almost worthless," said Carson, who, along with other 
dissident researchers, has identified numerous problems with the best-known 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
Carson also pointed out that even genetic researchers concede that nearly 90% 
of schizophrenic patients have no close relatives with the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Most researchers believe that some genetically vulnerable individuals react 
badly to stress, which means that both biology and environment contribute to 
the appearance of schizophrenia. But some specialists emphasize the role of the 
latter, rejecting the view that schizophrenia is simply a brain disease that 
"happens" to people -- a view that has found favor among organizations made up 
of the families of schizophrenics. 
</P>
<P>
A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine last March, for 
example, used a new scanning technique to compare the brains of 15 sets of 
identical twins, one of whom in each case was schizophrenic. Differences in the 
brains were noted in almost every case -- even though identical twins have 
identical genes. Clearly, something other than genetic factors must have 
produced those differences. 
</P>
<P>
When researchers discover a neurological abnormality in people with behavioral 
disorders, it is usually assumed that this feature of the brain is responsible 
for the behavior. In fact, though, it may work the other way around. In the 
schizophrenia study, it might even be that the anatomical difference resulted 
from drugs given to the schizophrenics, Zubin conceded. 
</P>
<P>
Also cited at the conference was a recent Finnish study that followed 271 
children of schizophrenic mothers, all of whom were put up for adoption. Of the 
children who were placed in families judged as psychologically healthy, not one 
became schizophrenic. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the impression given in many popular articles on the subject, UCLA 
psychologist Michael J. Goldstein concluded in a 1988 review of three major 
studies that "variations in the rates of schizophrenia are predictable" not 
only from genetics but "in part from prior estimates of disturbances in the 
'family' environment." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, said McGlashan, director of the Chestnut Lodge Research Institute, 
"the schizophrenia-as-brain-disease theory is taken to mean that all you have 
to do is give them a drug -- you don't have to worry about the patient as a 
person." 
</P>
<P>
University of Chicago psychiatrist Laura Miller, who was not at the conference, 
agrees that psychotherapy, and not merely medication, "makes sense for some 
schizophrenics even when there does appear to be a biological basis." Therapy 
can address the psychological purposes that some symptoms serve and can help 
patients cope with the day-to-day effects of delusions, impaired communication 
and loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
Miller has also uncovered other evidence that suggests the schizophrenic is an 
active subject rather than the helpless object of an illness. In an unpublished 
study, Miller found that many schizophrenics value their hallucinations, and 
that as a result these people "find some way to continue hallucinating" despite 
their treatment. 
</P>
<P>
While Carson and others dismissed the idea that a "cure" will ever be found for 
schizophrenia -- largely because this reflects a misconceived notion of the 
nature of the disorder -- Zubin emphatically rejected the pessimistic idea that 
schizophrenics rarely get better. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a permanently chronic condition leading to deterioration," he said. 
In fact, "from 23% to 50% of schizophrenics never relapse after their first 
episode." 
</P>
<P>
But some of the sterner critics at the conference pointed out that even to talk 
about a "first episode" or about "symptoms" is to assume the existence of an 
ongoing disease -- an assumption not proved to everyone's satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
A clever researcher who chose to attribute madness to supernatural causes could 
"prove" that demonic possession runs in families and that its effects were 
mitigated by taking certain medications, according to Carson. This no more 
demonstrates the value of invoking the devil than similar findings justify 
invoking neurobiology. 
</P>
<P>
According to Daniel Miller of Wesleyan University, some theorists see 
schizophrenia as a "clear-cut, static entity" with a cause that can be pinned 
down -- which reflects 19th-Century scientific thinking. Others see it in terms 
of evolving social arrangements and interactions. Which of these two basic 
models is preferred ultimately comes down to "a matter of faith," he 
maintained.

A contaminant found in mussels apparently caused an unusual and irreversible 
long-term memory loss in 14 people in Canada in late 1987, scientists reported 
last week. A toxin called domoic acid produced by a common seaweed appears to 
have destroyed brain cells, leaving 13 of the victims permanently disabled. 
</P>
<P>
While no other cases are believed to have occurred, the incident led to changes 
in the way mussels are labeled and tested in Canada and prompted an extensive 
testing program for domoic acid in Maine, which produces 85% of mussels in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Domoic acid apparently creates hyperactivity in brain cells and "makes the 
cells almost commit suicide," said Dr. Neil Cashman, a neurologist and 
co-author of one of two studies on the mussel contamination published in the 
New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
In one study, the toxin caused a variety of symptoms, including vomiting, 
abdominal cramps, diarrhea and severe headaches; 25% of those affected suffered 
short-term memory losses. 
</P>
<P>
The research could have implications for understanding such devastating brain 
disorders as Alzheimer's disease and Lou Gehrig's disease, which some 
scientists suspect may involve a toxin, Cashman said.

AIDS CONFERENCE ENDS ON NOTE OF CONFIDENCE; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: BUT PARTICIPANTS ARE REMINDED THAT THE WORLDWIDE EPIDEMIC REMAINS OUT 
OF CONTROL.

<TEXT>
<P>
After five hectic days of activism and science, the Sixth International 
Conference on AIDS concluded Sunday with optimism over the prospects for better 
treatments and a vaccine but sobering reminders that the worldwide AIDS 
epidemic remains out of control. 
</P>
<P>
While promising, preliminary studies of new antiviral drugs and prototype 
vaccines grabbed the headlines, many researchers stressed that educating people 
to avoid infection with the human immunodeficiency virus still remains the only 
way to significantly affect the course of the disease both in the United States 
and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"The epidemics in Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and Southeast Asia are 
not coming under control -- they are expanding," said Dr. Jonathan Mann, the 
American physician who many view as the conscience of the global AIDS battle. 
"The hard-learned lessons from San Francisco, Amsterdam, Sydney and Nairobi 
(where AIDS prevention efforts have been most intensive) are not being 
systematically applied." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. James W. Curran of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said the estimated 
40,000 to 80,000 new infections a year in the United States indicate that the 
epidemic is still growing. "We are nowhere near level yet." 
</P>
<P>
Frustration over the U.S. government's response to the epidemic erupted at the 
conference's closing ceremonies. Several hundred AIDS activists drowned out 
remarks by Dr. Louis Sullivan, the U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services. 
Sullivan emphasized the need for tolerance and unity in the fight against AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the grim global statistics -- an estimated 6 to 8 million people 
worldwide already infected with HIV and a cumulative total of 15 to 20 million 
infections predicted by the end of the decade -- this was the first 
international AIDS conference where the promise of eventual success loomed 
large, if only the political, economic and social will can be found to 
implement the key research advances. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal for the 1990s should be a lofty one, namely the ability to completely 
and indefinitely suppress HIV in infected individuals," said Dr. Anthony S. 
Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases. Fauci spoke at Sunday's closing session, during which activists 
heckled Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
"The pandemic's short history also means that the potential to influence its 
future course remains high," said Mann, the former director of the World Health 
Organization's AIDS program. "There is no country and no population in which 
AIDS is a 'lost cause' -- unless it is abandoned." 
</P>
<P>
This new optimism is based not on dramatic breakthroughs -- of which there were 
none reported this week -- but on the cumulative effect of reports of promising 
experimental drugs and successful AIDS vaccine tests in animals. 
</P>
<P>
Many leading vaccine researchers predicted that large-scale tests of 
experimental AIDS vaccines could begin in humans within two to four years and 
that tests to determine if vaccines can protect the fetuses of infected 
pregnant women could begin next year. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers at UC Davis reported preliminary success in protecting cats against 
an immunodeficiency virus similar to HIV. Scientists at the Medical Biology 
Institute in La Jolla also described advances in a mouse model for HIV 
infection that may prove useful in testing prototype vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
There was general agreement that combinations of anti-HIV drugs now under 
development will yield superior results to single drugs. Scientists here also 
concurred that, as Dr. Margaret Fischl of the University of Miami said, 
"Intervention should occur as early as possible. . . . This will be associated 
with the best benefit and delay in progression to AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
HIV gradually destroys the body's immune system, leaving infected individuals 
vulnerable to many life-threatening infections and tumors. AIDS, however, can 
sometimes be postponed with the antiviral drug AZT or antibiotics to prevent 
AIDS-related Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
Yet years of profound suppression of the immune system seem to take an 
inevitable toll. Dr. Robert Yarchoan, a senior investigator at the U.S. 
National Cancer Institute, reported that a group of severely immuno-suppressed 
AIDS patients on long-term AZT therapy had a 46% risk after three years of 
developing "high-grade" non-Hodgkins lymphoma. 
</P>
<P>
This cancer of the lymph node is notoriously difficult to treat in HIV-infected 
individuals. Although many AIDS-related pneumonias are being prevented, cases 
of non-Hodgkins lymphomas are rapidly increasing across the country. 
</P>
<P>
According to updated results from the San Francisco Department of Public 
Health, about half of HIV-infected individuals develop AIDS within 10 years of 
becoming infected. About 15%, however, not only have not developed AIDS but 
continue to have normal or near-normal immune systems. It is unclear whether 
these individuals will eventually develop AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
These findings offer hope that all infected individuals can someday be 
maintained with functioning immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone is talking about a cure in the sense of getting rid of 
every last piece of virus," Yarchoan said. "But there are many viruses that we 
have in our body and that we live with and they really don't bother us." 
</P>
<P>
Yarchoan added: "Most adults in this country are infected with Epstein-Barr 
virus (which causes mononucleosis) and yet it doesn't do them any harm. The 
goal is to convert HIV into a virus like that." 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of new AIDS drugs are in various stages of development, ranging from 
compounds similar to AZT, such as DDI, DDC, AzDU and d4T, to various therapies 
to boost the immune system, such as Dr. Jonas Salk's HIV-immunogen, to novel 
substances that may block the growth of the virus, such as protease inhibitors 
and so-called "TIBO derivatives." 
</P>
<P>
If a sufficient number of these drugs maintain their early promise, AIDS 
researchers and government officials may need to reset priorities for large 
clinical trials so that the combinations of agents most likely to be safe and 
effective are tested first. As a result, many highly touted drugs are likely to 
fall by the wayside as the more active and less toxic agents are identified. 
</P>
<P>
Fauci cautioned, however, that researchers were "far from reaching our goal 
regarding therapy." Drugs such as AZT, DDI and DDC "have considerable toxicity 
and are generally only temporarily effective," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But while "early intervention" against AIDS emerged as a new buzz phrase among 
American researchers and their Western European counterparts, the high cost of 
such therapy illustrated the increasing gap between rich and poor -- both 
within nations and between nations -- when it comes to AIDS treatments. 
</P>
<P>
"Early intervention is still a meaningless concept in developing countries; AZT 
remains too expensive for most of the people who need it," Mann said. (The 
wholesale price for the 500 mg daily dosage regimen recommended for adults with 
asymptomatic HIV infections is about $2,200 a year.) 
</P>
<P>
As examples, Mann pointed out that the total budget of the average national 
AIDS program in the developing world "is less than the cost of caring for only 
15 people with AIDS in the United States." And the industrialized world's total 
contribution to AIDS in the developing world is about $200 million a year, or 
one-fifth the total annual expenditure on AIDS prevention and care in New York 
state alone. 
</P>
<P>
Through intravenous drug use and prostitution, the number of HIV-infected 
individuals in Thailand has increased from less than 1,000 in late 1987 to more 
than 100,000. In India, heterosexual transmission in cities such as Bombay has 
spawned a rapidly growing HIV epidemic that is already larger than the Thai 
epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
The profound effect of inadequate resources to fight AIDS is most evident in 
sub-Saharan Africa. Between 1987 and 1989, the number of infected individuals 
increased from 2.5 million to more than 4 million as the virus spread from 
cities to rural areas, according to Dr. James Chin of the World Health 
Organization's AIDS program. Hundreds of thousands of children are either 
infected or orphaned. 
</P>
<P>
The number of HIV infections in these areas represents at least half of the 
global total. In Uganda alone -- a nation of 16.8 million -- an estimated 1 
million people are infected, which is about the same number of HIV infections 
as in the entire United States . 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa has sparked an equally 
alarming epidemic of tuberculosis. One and a half million people there are 
estimated to be dually infected with HIV and tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike AIDS, tuberculosis is relatively easy to treat and prevent. HIV 
infection is "the most potent activator of dormant tuberculosis ever detected," 
according to Dr. Peter Eriki of the WHO. 
</P>
<P>
"They were unable to contain a relatively small tuberculosis problem before the 
arrival of HIV and they are singularly ill prepared for coping with a very 
large problem ahead," Eriki said. 
</P>
<P>
It is for such reasons that Mann and current WHO officials urged a global 
vision to confront a global problem. 
</P>
<P>
"AIDS has become the crucible in which the future of health is being forged," 
Mann said. "Either we build upon and strengthen and expand what has already 
been accomplished, or in the years to come we will fall further and further 
behind the pace of the worldwide epidemic."

U.S. LOOKS ABROAD FOR ITS HEROES; 
</P>
<P>
AMERICANS OFFER ADULATION TO FOREIGNERS SUCH AS MANDELA, WHO SEEM TO EMBODY THE 
HEROIC QUALITIES LACKING IN THE INSTANT CELEBRITIES AT HOME.

<TEXT>
<P>
The faces in the crowd are the same: eager and expectant -- that mixture of awe 
and hope in the gaze of people who have waited hours for a chance to touch the 
hand or hear the words of a hero. 
</P>
<P>
Only the heroes have changed. The objects of Americans' adulation have 
developed a distinctly foreign cast. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few months, Lech Walesa and Mikhail S. Gorbachev have made 
triumphal tours across America that no domestic figure seems able to equal. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is Nelson Mandela -- cheered by a million New Yorkers this week, 
showered by confetti in a ticker-tape parade on Broadway and saluted at rallies 
as he began a tour of America. 
</P>
<P>
Is the American hero now an import? 
</P>
<P>
For most of this century, American heroes have been just that -- American. 
Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., John 
Glenn -- each excelled in a different sphere. But all were seen as embodying 
central aspects of the American character and were placed on the exalted 
platform that the nation reserves for its most admired figures. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, by contrast, America has been marked by a deep cynicism about 
its domestic political figures and institutions, said David Riesman, a retired 
Harvard social historian. In arenas as varied as sports, politics and 
entertainment, idols have turned out to have feet of clay. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Americans in the final decade of the 20th Century are 
bombarded with celebrity, as Daniel J. Boorstin, formerly the librarian of 
Congress, noted in his book, "The Image." 
</P>
<P>
"Celebrity-worship and hero-worship should not be confused," Boorstin wrote. 
"Yet we confuse them every day," and "by doing so we come dangerously close to 
depriving ourselves of all real models." 
</P>
<P>
Because they are unable to identify real domestic heroes among the mass of 
instant celebrities, Americans naturally gravitate to foreigners who seem to 
display heroic characteristics such as courage, decisiveness and mastery of 
fate. 
</P>
<P>
"There's almost gratefulness to these people for existing," Riesman said. "We 
still want to look up to people. We're not as cynical as we sometimes like to 
make out we are." 
</P>
<P>
There are no exact measures of the breadth of these new heroes' appeal. Each 
has tailored his U.S. visit to cities where his appeal would likely be 
greatest, as UC Berkeley political scientist Raymond E. Wolfinger noted. 
</P>
<P>
Thus Polish labor leader Walesa visited Chicago, with its huge Polish-American 
community. Soviet President Gorbachev visited Minneapolis and San Francisco, 
two of the most liberal cities in the nation. South Africa's Mandela is 
visiting a series of cities with large black populations. 
</P>
<P>
The eagerness of national politicians to get close to the visitors, the 
attentiveness of the news media, the vast enthusiasm of the crowds and the 
results of public opinion polls all indicate that the impact has been real and 
considerable. 
</P>
<P>
That impact has been possible because of both a dearth of home-grown heroes and 
a shift in how Americans view the nation's position in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The decline of home-grown heroes has many possible causes. 
</P>
<P>
Boorstin argues that the cult of celebrity has drowned out the possibility of 
authentic heroes. The whirl of stars, each rising fast and most falling just as 
fast, along with the widespread commercialization of popular entertainment, 
have changed the way Americans view many aspects of mass culture. 
</P>
<P>
Consider sports, to take one example. Basketball player Michael Jordan is 
probably the best-known sports star in the nation. Americans know him both as a 
player and as a commercial symbol for such products as Wheaties and Nike. He 
earns a huge income, far more than ever dreamed of by Babe Ruth or Joe 
DiMaggio. But neither Jordan nor any other athlete of today seems able to 
command the broad public affection that was lavished on Ruth and DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
Few Frontiers 
</P>
<P>
Those who conquered new frontiers traditionally became American heroes. Daniel 
Boone, Davy Crockett, Kit Carson and "Buffalo Bill" Cody went west. Later 
heroes crossed the frontiers of air and space: Charles A. Lindbergh with his 
solo flight across the Atlantic, Glenn with the first American orbit of the 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Today, those frontiers seem constrained, said Michael Lofaro of the University 
of Kentucky, who has studied heroes in American literature. Heroes are far 
harder to develop, he said, in an age when "the great man has been replaced by 
the machine." 
</P>
<P>
Political figures have provided another source of heroes in eras past. But, 
today, said historian William C. Leuchtenberg of the University of North 
Carolina, politics is dominated by "men in gray flannel suits" who simply fail 
to excite. 
</P>
<P>
The only recent political figure who approached hero status is former President 
Ronald Reagan. In the latter part of his term, however, Reagan lost 
considerable standing because of the Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving office, Reagan appears to have fallen victim to the defect that 
has plagued many other would-be American heroes -- commercialization. The 
multimillion-dollar fee he received last year for a brief speaking tour in 
Japan detracted from his image as a man who transcended the worldly concerns of 
ordinary Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The news media's intense concentration on the private lives and scandals of 
popular figures may also play a role in knocking down American heroes as fast 
as they can rise. 
</P>
<P>
Former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado might never have become a heroic figure even 
if the press had not reported on his interest in women other than his wife 
during his 1988 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. But, as 
biographers have since disclosed, earlier political figures, such as President 
John F. Kennedy, had similar sexual peccadilloes that were not reported at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of domestic heroes leaves a void. As Riesman said, heroes are an 
essential part of every culture, reassuring the public that something exists 
that is larger than life. 
</P>
<P>
Boundaries Fall 
</P>
<P>
America's changing role in the world has made that void easier to fill from 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign heroes are not entirely new. After a wave of mostly unsuccessful 
revolutions swept Europe in 1848, some of the leading insurrectionaries -- the 
Lech Walesas of their day -- toured America, the land of democracy and 
revolution, seeking support. Lajos Kossuth, the leader of Hungary's failed 
attempt to free itself from Austria, attracted 100,000 people, who lined the 
railroad tracks from Columbus to Cleveland to cheer him as he toured Ohio, 
still a frontier state, in 1852. 
</P>
<P>
A century later, Sir Winston Churchill became one of the most widely admired 
men in America for his brave leadership of Britain in the fight against Nazism. 
</P>
<P>
Those events, however, have been exceptions. More often, Americans have been 
notable for a feeling that theirs was a country that would find little to learn 
and even less to admire in the "Old World." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, those who were thought to cleave to non-American role models were often 
subjects of suspicion. During the 1960 presidential campaign, Kennedy was 
forced to defend himself against charges that his Roman Catholic faith would 
subject him to dictation from a foreign Pope. Jews were often suspected of 
possessing a dual loyalty to the United States and Israel that placed their 
patriotism under suspicion. During the height of the Cold War, that wariness of 
foreigners became entwined with fear of communism to produce a generalized 
suspicion of "outside influences" in much of American society. 
</P>
<P>
That resistance appears to have faded, at least among substantial parts of the 
American population. An increased amount of travel abroad, widespread 
television pictures from overseas and the increased celebration of ethnic 
diversity at home have combined to make Americans more open to foreign 
concepts, said Berkeley's Wolfinger. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, said Stanford sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset, Americans 
once more see the world as being open to them and their values. 
</P>
<P>
Until very recently, Mandela, for example, might have made many Americans 
nervous. Although American opinion generally has opposed apartheid for years, 
the African National Congress' ties to the South African Communist Party and 
its guerrilla tactics made many Americans uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
But now concerns about communism have sharply diminished. Even the leader of 
the Soviet Union, which no longer seems poised to launch its nuclear missiles, 
can be praised in the United States for pursuing greater freedom and openness 
-- what many Americans see as "their values." 
</P>
<P>
Projection of those values onto a public figure is at the heart of how a hero 
is created. Throughout history, heroes have been concocted of fact mixed with 
large amounts of fantasy and hope. Indeed, one of the major deterrents to the 
development of new American heroes may be the relentlessness of the modern 
publicity apparatus, which renders nearly everything accessible and leaves 
almost nothing mysterious. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, although satellite television pictures and overseas newspaper 
correspondents bring foreign figures unprecedented amounts of public 
recognition within the United States, foreign leaders still remain sufficiently 
veiled behind a curtain of distance and unfamiliarity that they leave something 
to Americans' imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Skepticism Fades 
</P>
<P>
When Gorbachev came to power in 1985, Americans initially viewed him as being 
cut from the same cloth as his predecessors, said Jeffrey C. Alexander, 
chairman of UCLA's sociology department, who has studied the development of 
Gorbachev's public image. Within the first year, however, Americans, and 
particularly their news organizations, began to describe Gorbachev as 
pragmatic, dynamic, informal, spontaneous and self-confident. 
</P>
<P>
That in turn appears to have influenced American policy. Public confidence in 
Gorbachev has tempered domestic pressure on the Bush Administration to take a 
tough line with the Soviets over the Lithuanian crisis, for example. White 
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater attracted criticism when he referred to the 
Soviet leader last spring as a "drugstore cowboy," and Bush now routinely 
praises Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
The process has been even more striking in Mandela's case. 
</P>
<P>
"For the broad American public, we didn't know who this man was," said pollster 
and political consultant Paul Maslin. In the last few years, Mandela's name 
became known to some Americans, particularly blacks, but little was known of 
his history. For nearly 28 years, his words and ideas had reached the outside 
world only sporadically and through the intermediaries who were allowed rare 
visits with him in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Strangest of all in this video age, no one outside of a small circle of 
intimates had seen his face. 
</P>
<P>
And then, in pictures watched by hundreds of millions of people around the 
globe, Mandela walked out of prison in a scene that almost perfectly 
recapitulated essential elements of ancient myths about heroes who dramatically 
return from long exile to save their people. 
</P>
<P>
For most Americans, the specifics of Mandela's ideas and the details of his 
policies remain obscure and, perhaps, not even relevant. When asked by 
reporters why they turned out to see him, people in the crowds commonly used a 
phrase that applies more to the United States than to Africa: civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
For many Americans, black and white, Mandela has become "a 1990 version of 
Martin Luther King," Maslin said. 
</P>
<P>
That connection could become the key to how the country greets the African 
National Congress leader as his tour of the nation continues. Mandela began 
entering the American consciousness primarily as a hero for black Americans. He 
was part of a long tradition of ethnic heroes -- nationalist leader Eamon de 
Valera for Irish-Americans earlier in this century, for example, and the late 
Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir for Jews. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, however, Mandela has emerged as a hero with a broader reach. As 
an apostle of a future cleansed of racism, Mandela fills a void for many white 
Americans who, since King's assassination in 1968, haven't had "a black leader 
they can unambivalently admire," said Anne Fabian, who teaches American studies 
at Yale University. 
</P>
<P>
"Mandela makes us feel good about ourselves," said UCLA's Alexander. "He's 
raising a dream of a multiracial society; that's what we're celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what the person is like, so we're really thinking about our own 
society," he said. "These heroes are projections of what we think they are or 
what we'd like to become. That's why we create them."

JUDGE LAUDED FOR POLICY OF LETTING INS SCREEN COURT; 
</P>
<P>
IMMIGRATION: HE ASSISTS IN EVENTUAL DEPORTATION OF DEFENDANTS WHO ARE ILLEGAL 
ALIENS. A BILL IN SACRAMENTO WOULD ENCOURAGE OTHER JURISTS TO DO THE SAME.

<P>
Eighteen months after Judge David O. Carter invited federal immigration agents 
into his Orange County courtroom to identify illegal aliens convicted of 
serious crimes, the experiment is being eyed as a model for California and 
other border states. 
</P>
<P>
A proposed law that would encourage all Superior Court judges in California to 
follow Carter's lead easily cleared the state Assembly recently. And in 
Washington, the leader of a U.S. Justice Department-backed study said he, too, 
is optimistic about duplicating the Orange County project in other courts. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very impressed with the program in Orange County," said Joseph A. 
Trotter Jr., a lawyer at American University who is conducting the study with a 
Justice Department grant. "It has a lot of potential benefit for alleviating 
caseload pressures." 
</P>
<P>
Carter is believed to be the only county or state judge in the country who has 
invited INS agents to screen people coming through his court -- and his 
approach is criticized by some who see it as abusive of detainees or a misuse 
of time. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the only judge who feels it's necessary to use state resources for a 
federal agency," said Ramon Ortiz, the assistant public defender in charge of 
Orange County Superior Court cases. "I find it wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Most of those coming to Carter's court and screened by the INS are felons who 
have violated the terms of their probation. A smaller percentage have pleaded 
guilty to a new felony offense and are awaiting sentencing before Carter, 
although he said he does not know in advance what any offender's residency 
status is. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to allowing access to the offenders, Carter's court staff also 
promptly provides the INS agents with certified criminal-conviction documents 
that are crucial to the deportation process, according to immigration 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's statistics show that illegal aliens make up more than one-third of the 
criminal offenders appearing in his court. According to the records, 35% -- 834 
of the 2,366 offenders screened in 1989 -- were identified as illegal aliens. 
If those violators are not deported upon completing their sentences, local 
probation officers already working at full capacity must supervise them. 
</P>
<P>
For Carter, a remedy is at hand: Those illegal-alien offenders -- many of whom 
have committed drug offenses, burglary or violent crimes -- should not continue 
to burden the probation system. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be damned if I'm not going to have the resources to turn around a 
16-year-old, or an 18-year-old kid" who otherwise might lose the chance to be 
rehabilitated while on probation, Carter, 46, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Because of legal restraints and limited federal funds, Carter conceded that it 
may be impossible to quickly clear caseloads by deporting criminal aliens 
before they are sentenced to already-clogged jails and prisons. 
</P>
<P>
But Carter and INS officials said they are hopeful that, after the illegal 
aliens have served their sentences and are formally deported as felons, they 
will be less eager to re-enter the United States and risk prosecution that 
could result in maximum terms of two to 15 years in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
John Brechtel, INS assistant district director for investigations, did not have 
statistics to document his view, but he said he is convinced "the rate of 
recidivism is less" among those deported with a formal, criminal-alien status. 
</P>
<P>
An observation by The Times of Carter's court last week found that INS agents 
questioned female and male offenders who would appear later in the morning 
before the judge. The questioning occurred through the metal bars of a holding 
cell two floors beneath the courtroom in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Once the agents located an offender they believed was an illegal alien, they 
asked questions aimed at providing the best long-term identification aids. One 
man, for instance, displayed a hand with a severed middle finger. Another 
showed a huge tattoo on his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
The aliens set to appear before Carter, said one of the INS agents, "are very 
cooperative. It's very rare that someone will claim that he's an American 
citizen when he's an undocumented alien." 
</P>
<P>
The agents said that the most basic tip-off of whether an individual is in the 
United States illegally is whether that person can speak English. After the 
questioning is completed and those interviewed appear before Carter, the 
judge's staff provides the necessary paper work, usually within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
A bill inspired by Carter's project cleared the state Assembly on June 15 by a 
61-4 vote. It would specify that judges could, under state law, similarly 
cooperate with the INS. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of (judges) are hesitant to implement it because it is not specifically 
allowed for in law," said Lynn Montgomery, a spokeswoman for the bill's author, 
Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
The measure, AB 3819, is awaiting a hearing in the state Senate and Roos said 
he expects it to pass. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County project also is getting national scrutiny. Trotter, the 
lawyer at American University, has enlisted court officials from Texas and Cook 
County, Ill., to help examine the project. He said the group will report its 
findings to the Justice Department later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some look skeptically at the project. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Horowitz, supervisor of the court's 
criminal division, said he thinks it is better for INS agents to confine their 
screening to jail facilities. The INS has been granted access to Los Angeles 
County jails for about a year, Horowitz said, but not to courtroom holding 
cells, as allowed by Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Horowitz said that granting INS agents access to the holding cells "really 
interferes" with the confidentiality of conversations between defense lawyers 
and detainees in what are already cramped quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Nativo Lopez, spokesman for Hermandad Mexicana Nacional of Santa Ana, an 
advocacy group for undocumented workers, said he is "concerned from the 
standpoint that individuals are not informed that they have a right to counsel 
before they're interrogated by these people." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a specious argument," Carter countered, noting that INS agents routinely 
question suspected illegal aliens on the street and elsewhere without attorneys 
present. Carter said his project requires the questioning of detainees of all 
racial backgrounds and is fair because those being targeted have committed 
"aggravated" felonies and may be dangerous.

BACKING OF ABORTION RIGHTS NO GUARANTEE OF VICTORY AT POLLS

<P>
After taking credit for two highly visible electoral wins last fall, 
abortion-rights advocates have suffered a string of defeats in legislative 
races that appear to show that favoring legal abortion does not automatically 
enhance a candidate's chances for success in California. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortion activists, in fact, contend that recent election results 
demonstrate that candidates who clearly communicate their opposition to 
abortion can pick up votes in Republican races and in some sectors of the 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of abortion rights acknowledge that the issue is not a "magic 
bullet" that by itself can defeat a candidate who has other advantages or elect 
a person burdened with other political baggage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a miracle issue," said Robin Schneider, director of the Abortion 
Rights Action League's Southern California office. "It is very important with a 
large number of voters. But it can't just pull a candidate from the loser's 
column into the winner's column." 
</P>
<P>
The recent results have done nothing yet to alter the makeup of the 
Legislature, where abortion-rights advocates enjoy more clout than they have 
for years. State lawmakers are expected to approve a budget for the fiscal year 
beginning July 1 that for the first time in a decade will have no restrictions 
on the use of taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions for poor women. 
</P>
<P>
But this year's returns have shown that abortion-rights supporters may find it 
difficult to routinely duplicate the strength they demonstrated in special 
elections last year, when they were able to concentrate their firepower on one 
race at a time and focus the voters' attention on abortion. In regular 
elections and with politicians running for statewide office, other issues, 
including the candidates' gender, have proven to be just as important to voters 
as their stand on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
In the June 5 California primary, abortion was a prominent issue in eight 
Assembly races. Anti-abortion candidates won seven of those races. 
</P>
<P>
In the Republican race for lieutenant governor, abortion was the only major 
issue separating state Sens. Marian Bergeson and John Seymour, two little-known 
lawmakers from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Bergeson stood firm on her long-held position opposing abortion. Seymour, 
however, abandoned his anti-abortion stand and decided to back a woman's right 
to abortion and the concept of government funding for the procedure. Bergeson 
won with 55.2% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
This undercurrent was not visible, however, in the Democratic race for 
governor, where former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein was perceived as 
the stronger defender of abortion rights and easily defeated Atty. Gen. John K. 
Van de Kamp, who pledged to support legal abortions even though he personally 
opposes the practice. 
</P>
<P>
These skirmishes have set the stage for the November elections, when abortion 
rights will be highlighted in the races for lieutenant governor and attorney 
general, and a freshman Orange County assemblyman will try to keep his seat 
after being targeted for defeat by a national abortion-rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
It has been nearly a year since the U.S. Supreme Court's Webster decision 
opened the door for states to regulate abortion. That shift intensified 
interest in legislative elections and awakened activists on both sides of the 
issue who had seen little need for political activity since the court in 1973 
stopped states from regulating abortions. 
</P>
<P>
In California's first special election after the July 3 Webster decision, 
Republican Tricia Hunter, a nurse from Bonita and an abortion-rights supporter, 
swept past several anti-abortion foes to win the 76th District Assembly seat. 
In December, Democrat Lucy Killea of San Diego won a special election in a 
Republican-dominated state Senate district after the Catholic bishop of San 
Diego banned her from receiving Communion because of her advocacy of abortion 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, supporters of legalized abortion heralded the two contests as 
evidence that even conservative voters would elect candidates who back abortion 
when given a clear choice on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
But since Killea's victory, the trend has turned. 
</P>
<P>
In a special election to fill the 31st Senate District seat earlier this year, 
anti-abortion Republican Frank Hill won that party's nomination over a 
well-financed abortion-rights advocate. Hill triumphed even though he was 
campaigning under the cloud of an FBI corruption investigation. He later won 
the runoff easily to capture the seat. 
</P>
<P>
On June 5, abortion-rights groups targeted two incumbent assemblymen for 
defeat: Republican Gil Ferguson of Newport Beach and Democrat Pete Chacon of 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson's opponent was Phyllis Badham, the daughter of a well-known former 
congressman. Chacon ran against Celia Ballesteros, a lawyer and former city 
councilwoman. Both challengers were able to raise and spend about as much money 
as the incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
Although incumbent legislators generally are difficult to defeat, the results 
in these two races were just as lopsided as would have been expected had the 
abortion issue never been raised. Ferguson and Chacon both won by margins of 
more than 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, anti-abortion Assembly members Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and 
Dominic Cortese (D-San Jose) won easily against candidates who supported 
abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
Republican Paula Boland, who began the 38th District race in the San Fernando 
Valley as the least-known of three major candidates, and the only one to oppose 
abortion, was nominated. In the 58th District, Long Beach physician Seymour 
Alban ran a well-financed campaign that stressed his support for abortion 
rights. But he lost the GOP nomination to Huntington Beach Mayor Tom Mays, who 
opposes abortion. 
</P>
<P>
In the 30th District in the San Joaquin Valley, anti-abortion Republican Gerald 
G. Hurt defeated Bob Whalen after a campaign in which the Fresno Bee said the 
"only public difference between the two was over the abortion issue." 
</P>
<P>
The only victory for abortion-rights supporters was the renomination of 
Assemblywoman Hunter. But Hunter just barely defeated under-financed challenger 
Connie Youngkin, a nurse who has spent time in jail for helping the 
anti-abortion group Operation Rescue blockade abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Johnston, director of the National Right to Life Committee's Western 
region, said the results are evidence that the anti-abortion side has 
recaptured the political momentum. 
</P>
<P>
"When a pro-life candidate goes against a pro-abortion candidate and stands 
squarely on the issue, the pro-life candidate wins," Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
Abortion rights advocates, however, point out that other factors played a role 
-- the "gender vote," for example. The Los Angeles Times Poll showed, for 
instance, that three out of every five Republican women who said they support 
keeping abortion legal voted for Bergeson, even though she opposes that 
position. The implication is that many women were motivated to vote for 
Bergeson simply because she is a woman. 
</P>
<P>
Now both sides are looking toward the fall. Both candidates for governor, 
Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson and Democrat Feinstein, support abortion 
rights. But Feinstein maintains that abortion rights can best be protected by a 
woman governor. 
</P>
<P>
There are very distinct differences, however, in the abortion views of the 
lieutenant governor and attorney general candidates. Republican Bergeson will 
face Democratic Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy, who supports abortion rights. For 
attorney general, voters will choose between Republican Dan Lungren, a former 
congressman who opposes abortion, and Democrat Arlo Smith, the San Francisco 
district attorney who supports abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
At the legislative level, the race likely to attract the most interest will be 
Garden Grove Republican Curt Pringle's attempt to hold his Assembly seat 
against Democrat Tom Umberg. The National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL) 
has named Pringle one of its "NARAL Nine" -- a group of politicians across the 
country targeted for defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"Pringle is critical in our scheme," said Schneider of the California Abortion 
Rights Action League. "We know it is important to threaten incumbents. But it's 
also important to win against incumbents. If we can do that on the strength of 
the (abortion) issue, that ratchets up our political power."

BRADY BACKS NEIL BUSH: 'CAN'T IMAGINE HE BROKE LAW'; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE TREASURY SECRETARY NOTES THAT THE PRESIDENT'S SON WAS A DIRECTOR, 
BUT NOT AN OFFICER, OF A FAILED SAVINGS AND LOAN IN COLORADO. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady Sunday defended Neil Bush, the President's 
son who is under fire for his actions as a savings and loan director. "I can't 
imagine that he broke the law," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
Brady, in a television interview, noted that Bush was only a director of the 
failed Silverado Banking Savings &amp; Loan Assn. in Colorado and that "there 
are thousands of directors all over this world who sit on boards and (their) 
management go ahead and do things." 
</P>
<P>
It was disclosed last Tuesday that the enforcement staff of the federal Office 
of Thrift Supervision had charged that Neil Bush had engaged in "personal 
dishonesty" while on the board of Silverado, one of the biggest failures among 
hundreds of S&amp;L insolvencies. 
</P>
<P>
An OTS staff memo said that Bush had "willfully breached" his duty as a 
director by failing to inform his fellow board members that a major borrower at 
the S&amp;L, Kenneth M. Good, was going to pay $3 million for an 80% interest 
in Bush's oil exploration company. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing on ABC-TV's "This Week with David Brinkley," Brady, a close friend of 
the President, said he knew the younger Bush and could not believe the 
allegations. "I cannot imagine that he willfully did anything wrong," he said. 
". . . I just don't see this as anything more than an issue that's aimed at the 
President's son." 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, meanwhile, declined to disclose whether Bush is 
under investigation by his department, saying: "I can't discuss any pending 
investigations." 
</P>
<P>
But Thornburgh, appearing on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation," brushed aside the 
question of whether the Justice Department should stand aside to permit an 
independent counsel to look at the matter. "We go where the evidence leads," 
Thornburgh said. "And I don't mean to suggest that any particular individual is 
the subject of investigation, but wherever there's evidence of wrongdoing, 
we'll pursue it." 
</P>
<P>
Brady, asked whether Neil Bush would be investigated as strongly as anyone else 
against whom allegations had been leveled, said: "I would think so. When they 
fault him, one individual, up before the House Banking Committee -- there are a 
lot of people who were directors. This man wasn't even in the savings and loan 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a director. If every director of a savings and loan and bank was 
brought before Congress for something that bank did, we wouldn't have time to 
do anything else," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has strongly denied any wrongdoing in connection with his 1985-1988 tenure 
as a Silverado director. He is challenging in an administrative proceeding the 
government's allegations that he violated thrift rules. 
</P>
<P>
The OTS staff found that at about the same time that Good was buying control of 
Bush's firm, JNB, the board of Silverado agreed to forgive $11 million in loans 
and obligations to the institution that Good said he could not repay. 
</P>
<P>
Bush abstained from voting on Silverado's loans to Good, but the OTS document 
said he did not disclose his business relations with Good as required by 
federal regulations affecting thrift directors. 
</P>
<P>
Good and another investor in Bush's firm, William L. Walters, ultimately 
defaulted on more than $130 million in loans at Denver-based Silverado. The 
cleanup of the institution, which was seized by federal regulators last 
December, could cost taxpayers as much as $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Bush told the House Banking Committee that Good had loaned him $100,000 
"that was never meant to be repaid" if a speculative commodities scheme in 
which it was invested failed to show profits. Good invested the money for Bush 
in 1984, a year before Bush joined the Silverado board. 
</P>
<P>
The investment later went sour, and Good formally canceled the loan in January. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds a little fishy," Bush told the House panel in attempting to explain 
why he never mentioned the loan on a conflict-of-interest form required of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
Bush told the House committee that he never had any conflicts of interest while 
serving on Silverado's board, as regulators have charged in an administrative 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
He described the complaints as "frivolous. The fact they're being pursued is 
baffling to me."

BRIEFING: THE ELDERLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
SOCIAL SECURITY SEARCH: The Social Security Administration is looking for 
hundreds of thousands of older people with very low incomes who are eligible 
for federal cash payments but don't know it. 
</P>
<P>
The government plans to spend $3 million on demonstration projects around the 
country to educate people about Supplemental Security Income, a program for 
poor Americans over 65, and blind or disabled persons of all ages with scarce 
funds. Eligible persons generally have incomes below $406 a month, or $718 a 
month in California, which provides an extra benefit to supplement the federal 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that the Social Security Administration has a moral 
responsibility to identify those who are not receiving SSI benefits they are 
entitled to," said Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn S. King. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum benefit for a person with no other income is $386 a month for an 
individual, or $579 for a couple. 
</P>
<P>
EQUAL BENEFITS FOR ALL: Advocates for older Americans are hopeful Congress will 
pass legislation requiring business to give older workers the same fringe 
benefits -- health and life insurance, vacation pay, sick leave -- enjoyed by 
younger employees. The Supreme Court ruled last year that companies could 
discriminate in employee benefits on the basis of age. 
</P>
<P>
"We fear that employers will offer older people jobs without benefits," said 
Michele Pollak, legislative representative for the American Assn. of Retired 
Persons. Committees in both houses of Congress have passed legislation that 
would override the Supreme Court's ruling, and the prospects on floor action 
look favorable, Pollak said. The proposed legislation says employers must spend 
as much money on benefits for older workers as for younger persons. 
</P>
<P>
ALZHEIMER'S AID: Alzheimer's disease costs billions of dollars in nursing home 
care for its victims, but the federal budget for research into the cause of the 
deadly disease is a modest $150 million. Four out of five research projects 
reviewed and approved by the National Institute on Aging don't get funded 
because of a lack of federal dollars. 
</P>
<P>
The Alzheimer's Disease Assn., an organization of family members of victims, 
has enlisted strong congressional backing for its drive to boost the budget. 
"We're fighting for a substantial increase to $300 million," said Judy Riggs, 
director of federal issues. 
</P>
<P>
The inexorable mental deterioration of victims, who may remain physically 
healthy for years, imposes a terrible emotional and financial burden on 
families. Rep. Edward R. Roybal (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House Aging 
Committee, is promoting legislation to provide money to states to establish 
local respite care programs for families. The bill would pay for hiring someone 
to come into the home and give the care-givers time off from the grueling chore 
of living with an Alzheimer's victim. 
</P>
<P>
MEDI-GAP MADE EASY: The Senate Aging Committee has issued a guide to buying 
Medi-gap insurance, the private policies that supplement Medicare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
The guide also contains advice on health maintenance organizations, the 
Medicaid program for the poor and veterans benefits. Copies are available from 
the Senate Aging Committee, Room G-31 Dirksen Building, Washington, D.C., 
20510. ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT

IRAN: FAMILIES SHED THE SHOCK AND GRIEF OF THE DISASTER AND BEGIN TO THINK 
ABOUT THE FUTURE.

MANJIL, Iran 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An old wire tray, a broken chandelier and some twisted blue window blinds. 
That's not much for a new start. But atop a heap of bricks and plaster that was 
a home, those objects had been set aside by a surviving family of Iran's killer 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
In the shattered city of Manjil in hard-hit Gilan province, families were 
shedding the shock and grief of the past three days and beginning Sunday to 
think about their future. The dead have been buried in a low hillside outside 
the city and the seriously injured taken to hospitals in Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
Scoops, shovels and men with picks and spades were sifting through the rubble 
for personal belongings -- furniture, carpets, kitchenware -- no longer with 
the care that followed Thursday's massive earthquake when the people of Manjil 
were searching for survivors. They now know their family losses in dead and 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
Talking to visiting reporters half an hour after another aftershock rocked the 
agricultural city overlooking Safid Reservoir, the townspeople showed little 
apprehension; there was work to be done. A pile of new yellow bricks sat by a 
curb, ready for rebuilding when the site is cleared. 
</P>
<P>
Iraj Behnia, a 57-year-old teacher, said his was one of the few families in 
Manjil to escape death. "But I can't feel happy," said the stocky Iranian in a 
black felt cap. "All the other families have suffered. Their problem is my 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
Others felt the same. Dr. Mohammed Hussein Dehjhany bused up to Manjil from the 
central city of Esfahan with his students, 13 male nurses, all, like the 
doctor, in white medical coats, to help out. "We are doing what we can, 
whatever the people want," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Earthquakes are fickle. Three houses in a row will be squashed like old tin 
cans and the fourth will be standing. But Thursday's quake stomped Manjil. An 
estimated 80% to 90% of the homes were destroyed. The death toll among the 
100,000 citizens was uncertain, but one relief worker estimated that more than 
60% of the populace was killed or injured. 
</P>
<P>
But the quake didn't crush the people's spirit. The work went on Sunday with 
neighbors helping neighbors, along with shovel-bearing detachments of uniformed 
soldiers. At other sites, some men worked alone, pulling back the sheets of 
tar-paper roofs to see what might be found underneath. 
</P>
<P>
Alijan Mustfada, a shopkeeper who helped other men dig through the rubble of 
his home, said he would live nowhere else. "Our memories are here," he said. 
Mustfada lost two sons in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
An old woman in a light-blue chador was making tea for her remaining family in 
a military tent on the side of the road when reporters approached. She spoke a 
few words of English, enough to get her point across without an interpreter. 
There were 16 deaths in her extended family, five in the badly damaged city of 
Roudbar nearby and the rest in Manjil. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry (about it)," she explained, "but I'm not upset. It happened. It 
happened." Her house was demolished, her car -- "German," she lamented -- was 
crushed, and she's living in the street. But life goes on. 
</P>
<P>
Other women were not so stoic, telling reporters in the Farsi language, which 
the Westerners could not understand, and in mime, which they did, what happened 
on Thursday. They threw arms up for the explosion of the quake and down for the 
fate of their city. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to deal with the immensity of the casualties in a disaster of this 
dimension, perhaps 50,000 dead and hundreds of thousands injured in Gilan and 
Zanjan provinces in the hilly country west of the Caspian Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Flying over the region in an Iranian air force Chinook helicopter, reporters 
saw the scars in village after village. A huddle of 30 or 40 mud-brick homes 
had a hole punched in the middle, but the houses on the perimeter appeared 
untouched. The city of Roudbar looked as if it had been shelled into rubble. 
</P>
<P>
Fifty thousand lives lost in two provinces having nearly 3 million population 
is believable, but the towns and cities are scattered, and the countryside 
seems tranquil until you see the wrecked structures. 
</P>
<P>
At a stop in the village of Tarem, there was nothing to see but shambles. The 
people are Kurds, who were moved from their homes in the northeastern corner of 
Iran 16 years ago by the late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi to suppress trouble 
between the Kurds and his government. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the colorfully dressed women were chanting in grief for their dead. 
They sat on a ridge at the edge of the village, which looked like an upturned 
box of matches. Tarem lies beside a river, and the houses were made in part of 
timber and reeds. The children flocked barefoot to see the helicopter set down 
in a field of thorn bushes. 
</P>
<P>
Children, however frightened they were by the quake and the aftershocks, 
provide the laughter in the stricken region. 
</P>
<P>
In Manjil, a small boy, his head helmeted in bandages, popped out of the 
family's tent and snapped a sharp salute to the touring foreign press, a little 
soldier in a scene of tragedy.

MARCOS JURY GIVEN MIXED BAG OF EVIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM C. REMPEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<DATELINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
History may have already passed judgment on Ferdinand E. Marcos, the Philippine 
president who impoverished his nation to fill his own secret bank accounts 
around the globe, but an American jury of office clerks, postal employees and 
utility workers still must decide if the dictator's widow was his accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
And as final arguments begin here this morning, culminating a grueling, 
emotion-charged trial that began three months ago, the evidence is mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Not one of 95 prosecution witnesses testified unequivocally that former 
Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos engaged in the coercion, bribery and 
kickback schemes that marked her late husband's graft-tainted regime. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is there much evidence among thousands of documents that record hundreds of 
millions of dollars in lavish spending on art, jewelry, clothes and real estate 
that links her directly to the corrupt plots used to acquire the money in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a weakness in the sweeping federal fraud and racketeering case 
against the 60-year-old widow, it is here. 
</P>
<P>
Imelda Marcos "just isn't like us," Wyoming attorney Gerry Spence has told 
jurors since he opened her defense. 
</P>
<P>
He compares the former first lady to a queen who left the details of business 
to her husband and confidants, who "never wrote a check" or personally paid a 
bill in her life. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a wife . . . she wasn't a financier," Spence insists. 
</P>
<P>
But that is not the whole picture displayed for this jury. 
</P>
<P>
Records and testimony show, for example, that it was the first lady -- not the 
president -- who plunged the Marcoses into what would become the costly and 
fateful morass of Manhattan real estate investments, ventures financed by money 
the government contends was looted from the Philippine treasury and 
fraudulently obtained from banks in New York and California. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence shows it was Imelda Marcos -- not her husband -- who spent millions of 
dollars on art and jewelry that ended up being charged against Philippine 
treasury notes and the profits of a government-owned bank. According to 
testimony, bags filled with $100,000 in cash were routinely withdrawn from the 
Philippine National Bank and delivered to her at her Waldorf Hotel suite. 
</P>
<P>
And it was Imelda Marcos -- in concert with her husband, according to records 
and witnesses -- who helped establish and maintain secret bank accounts into 
which poured hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes, kickbacks and coerced 
shares of business profits in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Spence called it "a way of life . . . a part of the system" in Third World 
countries like the Philippines; prosecutors called it "theft and plunder." 
</P>
<P>
"She wasn't just his wife," Assistant U.S. Atty. Debra Livingston said from the 
outset. "Imelda Marcos and Ferdinand Marcos were partners in crime." 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of racketeering, the former first lady faces a $1-million fine and 
forfeiture of millions more in assets, including real estate, art, jewels and 
bank accounts that would be turned over to the Philippine government. She also 
could be sentenced to 50 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos in 1988, what presiding U.S. 
District Judge John F. Keenan called "unprecedented . . . in the annals of 
American jurisprudence," marked the first time a former head of state had been 
charged with a crime in an American court. After the exiled president died in 
Hawaii last September, his wife became the first spouse of a former head of 
state to stand trial in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors say she violated American law while she was still first lady of the 
Philippines by stealing money in her own country and "exporting the fruits of 
fraud" to the United States. She continued to commit fraud after fleeing to 
Hawaii, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department lawyers built their case largely around the Marcoses' 
secret purchase of four Manhattan skyscrapers and her lavish spending habits. 
</P>
<P>
According to records and testimony, Imelda Marcos' venture into the real estate 
market began in the late summer of 1981. She first tried unsuccessfully to buy 
a Park Avenue luxury townhouse filled with art and antiques collected by 
philanthropist Leslie Samuels. 
</P>
<P>
As would be the case in later commercial real estate negotiations, she was 
represented by Gliceria Tantoco, one of the closest members of her inner 
circle, known as the "blue ladies." Her name usually went on the bills of sale, 
records show. 
</P>
<P>
After a gossip item appeared in a New York tabloid indicating the Philippine 
first lady was interested in the Samuels property, Tantoco threatened a young 
real estate agent that harm could come to him and his family if the 
confidentiality of the deal was compromised, testimony revealed. 
</P>
<P>
But the real estate portion of the deal collapsed when the building cooperative 
board rejected Tantoco, apparently concerned that she was fronting for a secret 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the first lady did purchase the Samuels art collection. It was paid 
for out of funds transferred to New York for the successful purchase of another 
piece of prime real estate -- the elegant Crown Building on 5th Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The Crown Building transaction apparently was the first lady's project from its 
inception. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981 she conferred first with the governor of the Philippine Central Bank 
about bidding on the building. Testimony indicated that the nation's top 
financial officer later informed the president in order to get his approval to 
take pre-negotiation steps. 
</P>
<P>
When Marcos later vetoed the deal, another banker testified, his wife made a 
tearful plea to the president to let her have the building as pamana, a term 
meaning inheritance. Evidence indicates she may have intended it as inheritance 
for her children. 
</P>
<P>
Such testimony conflicted with Spence's opening claims that New York real 
estate investments were made at the urging of then-Vice President George Bush 
to guarantee the Marcoses had resources outside the Philippines to finance 
their return if communist rebels took over their country. Those defense claims 
were never supported. 
</P>
<P>
The Crown Building was purchased for $51 million. Complex money transfers 
helped conceal the Marcoses' financial interests. Prosecutors called it money 
laundering. 
</P>
<P>
To fund the purchase President Marcos personally engineered a $30-million 
diversion of the impoverished nation's hard currency reserves. Another $6 
million was advanced by the National Sugar Trading Corp., a quasi-public agency 
responsible for marketing the country's sugar cane crops. 
</P>
<P>
Such evidence undermined defense assertions that the money may have come from 
the Marcoses' personal wealth. 
</P>
<P>
Another $4.95 million coursing through the labyrinth of international bank 
accounts en route to New York went to pay for the Samuels collection of art and 
antiques. 
</P>
<P>
Supposedly destined for a Manila museum or the official Philippine residence in 
New York -- which might have justified expenditures of public funds -- many of 
the valuable pieces ended up broken and covered with cobwebs in a shed outside 
the California home of the Marcoses' daughter, Irene. 
</P>
<P>
In her purchases of real estate, art, jewelry and other personal luxuries, the 
government says, she "orchestrated" frauds. 
</P>
<P>
For example, prosecutors say, a checking account at New York's Bankers Trust 
branch on Park Avenue maintained in the name of Fe Roa Gimenez was actually a 
secret account for Imelda Marcos. Gimenez was the first lady's longtime private 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecution accounting experts testified that from the Gimenez account alone 
nearly $8 million of the first lady's apparently personal expenditures -- 
including $7.5 million in jewelry -- were charged against Philippine treasury 
notes and the profits of Philippine National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
And, in direct contradiction of attorney Spence's opening statements, an FBI 
handwriting expert testified that the first lady did, indeed, write checks -- 
millions of dollars worth of checks -- signed with one of her several aliases: 
"Regina Marquez." 
</P>
<P>
The shroud of secrecy surrounding the Marcos purchases began to unravel in 1985 
as a worsening political crisis threatened President Marcos in Manila. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to close a sale were under way when the revolution closed in first. The 
Marcoses fled into exile, leaving thousands of documents behind in Manila. 
Thousands more, many of which were used as evidence in the trial, were seized 
in Hawaii by U.S. Customs agents. 
</P>
<P>
The new government of Corazon Aquino immediately won U.S. court orders freezing 
the Marcos assets. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, evidence shows, Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi was enlisted to 
help dispose of the Marcos property. According to testimony, false legal 
documents were created to reflect that Khashoggi had acquired control of the 
buildings prior to the freeze. 
</P>
<P>
Other records and testimony disclosed that some of the Marcos art was spirited 
out of the United States to France aboard Khashoggi's private jet and that a 
false document was prepared for French Customs agents showing the art had been 
acquired before the freeze. 
</P>
<P>
Khashoggi is a co-defendant in the Marcos trial. 
</P>
<P>
In cross-examinations of government witnesses Spence asserted that President 
Marcos was a wealthy man prior to his first election in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
However, lead prosecutor Charles LaBella, 39, and his assistants Livingston, 
31, and Denis McInerney, 30, have introduced overwhelming evidence that the 
wealth came instead from bribery, kickback, embezzlement and coercion. 
</P>
<P>
They have shown, for example, that Marcos pocketed 10% to 15% "commissions" on 
all Philippine war reparations projects funded by the Japanese government, and 
that he owned substantial shares of virtually every industry in the Philippines 
-- from mining and agriculture to shipping and insurance. Marcos even collected 
50 cents on every bag of cement produced by one company. 
</P>
<P>
Among factors working in favor of Imelda Marcos and her claim to be "just a 
wife," however, was LaBella's inability to link her directly to specific 
corruption schemes carried out in Manila by her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Some believe Imelda Marcos, who dresses in mourning black every day, also could 
benefit from a sympathy factor. Jurors have seen her cry and react to the 
emotional stress of the trial. For some time she wore a blood pressure monitor 
that buzzed frequently in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, as jurors gasped, she coughed up blood and collapsed at the 
defense table from the effects of stress-related gastritis.

<P>
Elizabeth Harwood, one of Britain's best-known operatic sopranos in the 1960s 
and 1970s, has died after a battle with cancer, her family said. She was 52. 
</P>
<P>
The singer, who specialized in lyric and coloratura roles and the music of 
Mozart, died Friday at her home in Fryerning, 20 miles northeast of London. 
</P>
<P>
She sang with nearly all the top British operatic companies and appeared 
regularly in leading roles at the prestigious annual music festival in 
Salzburg, Austria, in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
She made her operatic debut in 1960, singing Second Boy in "Die Zauberflote" at 
Glyndebourne in southern England. 
</P>
<P>
She had been heard by Herbert von Karajan, who approached her for his own 
Salzburg Festival. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, she scored her first major success, as the Countess Adele in Rossini's 
"Count Ory." In 1960, she won Britain's prized Kathleen Ferrier memorial award 
for singing, and in 1965 was joint winner of the Verdi Competition at Busseto 
in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
That same year she toured Australia with Dame Joan Sutherland's International 
Opera Co. 
</P>
<P>
She first appeared at Salzburg in 1970, when she sang the role of Constanze in 
Mozart's 1782 opera "The Abduction From the Seraglio" and that of Fiordiligi in 
"Cosi Fan Tutte." 
</P>
<P>
Returning to Salzburg in 1972, she sang the countess in a new production of 
Mozart's "The Marriage of Figaro," again conducted by Von Karajan. He continued 
to invite her to Salzburg for several more years. 
</P>
<P>
She repeated Constanze at Milan's La Scala in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Von Karajan also chose her to record the title role in Franz Lehar's "Merry 
Widow" and Musetta in Giacomo Puccini's "La Boheme." 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s her health began to deteriorate. Her last public performance 
was in November, 1989, at the Bath Festival in western England. 
</P>
<P>
She married publisher-businessman Julian Royle in 1966 and their home was known 
as a gathering place for both amateur and professional music makers. The couple 
had one son.

Eileen and Bob Wyckhuyse of Simi Valley have seven children, the youngest born 
just last week. 
</P>
<P>
Four of their children, all elementary-school age, attend the Hollow Hills 
Fundamental School in Simi Valley -- by their parents' choice. Each school day 
last year, Eileen Wyckhuyse and a neighbor traded car-pooling duties, driving 2 
1/2 miles each way and bypassing two neighborhood elementary schools to get to 
Hollow Hills. 
</P>
<P>
It's worth the trouble, said Wyckhuyse, 33, because Hollow Hills is a 
"fundamental school," an old-fashioned, back-to-basics public school that 
stresses discipline, high academic expectations, a strict dress code and daily 
homework assignments -- even for kindergarten students. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that, overall, my kids would be going to a school with other children 
whose parents are really concerned about their education," Wyckhuyse said. "I 
think the atmosphere is almost like a private school." 
</P>
<P>
Hollow Hills and Vista elementary schools in the Simi Valley Unified School 
District are among five such fundamental public schools in Ventura County, 
where teachers and parents talk a lot about responsibility, accountability, and 
holding students to higher standards than those found at most other schools. 
</P>
<P>
The concept is not new or unique. Fundamental schools proliferated in the early 
1980s after a report from the National Commission on Excellence in Education 
criticized the public school system for fostering "a rising tide of 
mediocrity." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike "magnet schools" established in some districts, Simi Valley's 
fundamental schools are not aimed at the intellectually gifted or those who 
want to specialize in a particular subject. According to parent handbooks for 
Vista and Hollow Hills, the schools have "only two reasons to exist . . . to 
provide a more rigorous educational program . . . and to hold a higher level of 
expectation for all involved -- educators, students and parents." 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the right school for everybody," said Hollow Hills Principal Susan 
Parks. "Part of our focus is to be more academic, but with the kinds of 
rigorous things we do, like homework every day, even when it's really simple 
it's too much for some kids. Other kids really thrive." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, many parents in Simi Valley believe such schools are right for 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
The names of nearly 600 Simi Valley children are on waiting lists to get into 
Hollow Hills and Vista for the next school year. About 200 of those names are 
on waiting lists for the kindergarten programs, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be a very popular concept with parents," said Vista Principal 
Sheila Robbins. Like the students, teachers and administrators must request to 
be placed at a fundamental school. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unique because everybody who is here wants to be here," said Robbins, who 
recently completed her first year at Vista after serving as principal at other 
Simi Valley schools for the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Funding and curriculum are the same as for traditional schools in the district. 
But fundamental teachers said they often do more with what they have, covering 
more ground and getting higher standardized test scores than at other schools. 
</P>
<P>
At Vista, for example, scores on the California Test of Basic Skills are 
typically in the 80th to 90th percentile range, depending on the grade level, 
while average scores statewide are between the 40th and 50th percentile, 
Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
The Simi Valley fundamental programs were started in 1982, after parents 
demanded a more rigorous, basic education program. Initially, children were 
enrolled on a first-come, first-served basis, but when parents started camping 
out overnight to get their children enrolled in kindergarten, the district 
started a computer lottery to determine who gets in. 
</P>
<P>
Parents must sign a contract stating that they will abide by school 
requirements for parents, including reviewing and signing homework assignment 
sheets daily. 
</P>
<P>
This year, parent Doug Stevens said, his son Devon, 5, a kindergartner, brought 
work home Mondays through Thursdays. For homework, kindergarten students had to 
ask their parents to read to them for 20 minutes, or solve word puzzles, or cut 
out magazine pictures of objects that all began with the same letter. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said he doesn't mind that some assignments are easy. 
</P>
<P>
"They're only 5 years old, and I'm not for pushing them too hard," Stevens 
said. "This is their first year away from home." 
</P>
<P>
Hollow Hills PTA President Gail Bennett was on a waiting list for six months 
before the first of her three children who have attended the school was 
admitted. Once a child gets in, his siblings get enrollment priority. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard they were a structured school, and I believe in homework and the 
basics," said Bennett, 50, who drives seven miles each way to bring her 
children to Hollow Hills. "Kids need structure and responsibility. My other 
child was in a regular school, and they had no homework. It makes a difference. 
It shows." 
</P>
<P>
Parent Grace Lu agrees. However, her son Timothy is still on the waiting list 
to get into Vista. He has been waiting a year already, and there are 61 
students ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
Although Timothy, 7, attended kindergarten at Vista, Lu and her husband, Rex, 
transferred him to an even stricter private Christian school in Canoga Park 
when he started having disciplinary problems in class, Lu said. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Lus are trying to get Timothy back into Vista. Grace Lu said the wait 
is particularly frustrating because they live a block from the school. 
</P>
<P>
"He's doing better now," she said, "but I feel he could learn better at Vista, 
so we want him back in." 
</P>
<P>
In the Pleasant Valley Elementary School District, there are fundamental or 
"structured" programs at three schools, Dos Caminos, Los Primeros and Bedford, 
an "open school" on the campus of El Descanso School. 
</P>
<P>
Dos Caminos Principal Al Lane said half his school is devoted to a fundamental 
program. There are usually fewer than 10 students per grade on the waiting list 
for enrollment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, school officials said, the fundamental program does not work for 
some students. Sometimes the daily homework assignments prove too much, or a 
student finds the atmosphere too restrictive, or a student is not meeting the 
school's standard for passing on to the next grade. In those cases, students 
may transfer back to normal programs. 
</P>
<P>
Even students who stay in fundamental schools say that keeping up with the 
workload can make extracurricular pursuits difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Jenifer Bennett, a fifth-grade student at Hollow Hills, said she has to squeeze 
in homework between dance and gymnastics classes twice a week. "It makes it 
harder to do other activities," said Jenifer, 10, who transferred to Hollow 
Hills after attending kindergarten at another school. 
</P>
<P>
But, she added: "Even though it's harder in some ways, I think you learn more. 
I think it's a better school."

280-ACRE BLAZE IN BRUSH EAST OF FILLMORE BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL; 
</P>
<P>
FIRE SEASON: TEEN-AGERS EATING LUNCH IN THE AREA ARE SUSPECTED OF ACCIDENTALLY 
STARTING THE BLAZE. EXPERTS FEAR THAT FOURTH OF JULY FIREWORKS COULD IGNITE THE 
COUNTY'S TINDER-DRY BRUSH.

<P>
A major brush fire east of Fillmore burned nearly 30 more acres Sunday, but 
firefighters brought it under control and hoped to have it extinguished by this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze began about 1 p.m. Saturday and blackened more than 280 acres by 
Sunday afternoon, firefighters said, making it an unusually large blaze for so 
early in the fire season, which began May 1. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got the potential to be a severe season out there," said Peter Cronk, an 
investigator for the Ventura County Fire Department. "I think we're going to 
get a lot of fires . . . this year." 
</P>
<P>
Cronk and other fire officials said they are especially concerned about misuse 
of fireworks during Fourth of July celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
"It gets crazy around here around the Fourth of July, especially when it's hot 
and dry," said Larry Whelan, a County Fire chief. "With those conditions, any 
little sparkler or firecracker will start a fire right now." 
</P>
<P>
Investigators suspect that two teen-agers started the fire near Fillmore, 
probably accidentally. "I think what they were probably doing is sitting up 
there and eating their lunch. They left everything there. Their sandwiches were 
there. Their Fritos were there." 
</P>
<P>
Two other youths told Cronk they saw teen-agers wearing backpacks running from 
the fire, he said. Had all four teen-agers remained at the scene, they might 
have been able to extinguish it, Cronk added. 
</P>
<P>
Fingerprints have been taken from a lighter and from plastic cups, Cronk said. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 people fought the fire Sunday. Using seven engines and a helicopter, 
firefighters had it under control at 4:38 p.m., said dispatcher CeCe Grives. 
</P>
<P>
"There are going to be hot spots for a few days," Grives said, such as tree 
stumps that continue to burn. 
</P>
<P>
Whelan said that with the approach of Fourth of July celebrations, the 
department is issuing fireworks safety materials to businesses and 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Fillmore is the only place in Ventura County where fireworks can be 
legally purchased, from Thursday through July 4. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 nonprofit civic and church organizations will set up stands along 
California 126 selling sparklers and other "safe and sane" fireworks, said 
Louis Garnica, fireworks chairman for St. Francis of Assisi Church of Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
The Rotary Club and Lions Club also will have sales booths, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Garnica said the church supplies safety brochures with its products. 
</P>
<P>
A 1989 state fire marshal's report said there were 29 fireworks-related 
incidents -- including fires and injuries -- in Ventura County between June 17 
and July 17 last year, causing a loss estimated at $119,050. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen of the incidents were caused by safe and sane fireworks, Whelan said. 
</P>
<P>
While the Fillmore fire might have been caused by negligence, Cronk said two 
other weekend blazes -- a one-acre fire in Santa Paula near the 12th Street 
bridge and a two-acre brush fire near Ventura Avenue and Canada Larga Road -- 
were deliberately set, probably by someone motivated by the Fillmore blaze. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're connected because there were 20 minutes between them and 
that's what it takes to get from one place to another," Cronk said. "Somebody's 
out there seeing this big head of smoke saying, 'Oh, boy, I want to get 
involved too.' "

MOTORCYCLE COLLECTORS MEET AND DREAM; 
</P>
<P>
HOBBIES: EASY RIDERS GATHER TO SHOW OFF THEIR CLASSIC HARLEY-DAVIDSONS AND 
INDIANS, INCLUDING A CIRCUS PERFORMER'S MOUNT, CUSTOM-BUILT IN 1908.

<P>
More than 3,000 people saw the "Globe of Death" in Harley Heaven on Sunday at 
the San Buenaventura Antique and Classic Motorcycle Show, a celebration of 
black leather, tattoos and chrome. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 mostly British and American bikes were on display at the Ventura 
County Fairgrounds, ranging from a 1969 Harley-Davidson worth $800 to the Globe 
of Death, a 1908 Indian 500cc custom-made for a circus performer who rode it in 
circles inside a steel-framed sphere. 
</P>
<P>
As buffs took snapshots and praised the bikes' fuel pumps, chains and motors, 
the proud owners sat on beach chairs drinking beer, smoking Marlboros, eating 
beef jerky and listening to a rock band while taking in the sun. Many of them 
said their bikes were not for sale, only on display. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Dillman and David Weidner sat beside their bikes, a red, 1945 Indian 
Chief and a gray, 1955 Triumph, respectively. Like many other exhibitors, they 
said it would take a lot to get them to part with their machines. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just hanging out, looking at all the old bikes you wish you owned when 
you were a kid but couldn't afford to buy," Dillman said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hughes, 46, did make a purchase at the show, paying $11,000 cash for a 
maroon, 1947 Indian Chief, his first classic motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to collect something, it might as well be a toy you can have 
fun with while its value goes up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The collector who sold the bike could not be found. "He's got cash in his 
pocket, so you know he's shopping around," said Gary Ziegler, a friend of 
Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most valuable bikes at the show, a brown, unrestored 1942 Crocker 
1,000cc in mint condition, belonged to collector Gordon M. Clark. His was the 
last Crocker to come off of the assembly line before the factory closed, Clark 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Only two '42 Crockers were sold last year -- a wrecked one went for $50,000 and 
a good one for $100,000, said Clark. He said he owns more than 30 classic bikes 
and knows almost every bike collector in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Hansley, 40, who owns the "Globe of Death" bike -- a slender, 
unpretentious machine that looks like a sturdy bicycle with a small motor under 
the frame -- said it is one of only four ever built. His was made for a circus 
performer named C'Dora. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only one known to still exist, so anywhere around the world it would 
bring a lot of money," said Hansley, who sported a "Globe of Death" sweat shirt 
and matching baseball cap and vowed to never sell the motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
Hansley, a retired graphics designer from Pasadena who was paralyzed in a 
motorcycle racing accident 20 years ago, sat in his wheelchair with a broad 
smile as a parade of collectors came up to congratulate him on his find. 
</P>
<P>
Hansley, who no longer rides, said he spotted the dilapidated "Globe of Death" 
bike two years ago at a motorcycle show in Hershey, Pa. He bought it for just 
over $10,000, completely restored it and added it to his 24-bike collection. 
</P>
<P>
Event sponsor David Hansen said the Ventura show, which began two years ago, 
was a success and is quickly becoming one of the premier motorcycle exhibitions 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
He said he was particularly pleased with the variety and price range available 
to prospective collectors. Glancing at the relatively inexpensive '69 Harley, 
he said, "There's a collectors' item right there. Everything's collectible 
after enough time goes by."

A DREAM OF LUXURY TURNED INTO NIGHTMARE; 
</P>
<P>
FRAUD: OVER 200 PEOPLE POURED $12 MILLION INTO A DYNAMIC SALESMAN'S REAL ESTATE 
DEVELOPMENT FIRM, LURED BY PROMISED HIGH RETURNS AND BY THE TRAPPINGS OF HIS 
SUCCESS.

<P>
To those who knew him, Amway distributor Al Keranen seemed to personify the 
dream of instant riches. 
</P>
<P>
With a sprawling house in Woodland Hills, fancy cars, a private plane and a 
second home at a Utah ski resort, the former high school football 
coach-turned-salesman radiated prosperity as brightly as the sun that glinted 
off his gold Rolex watch and diamond pinky ring. 
</P>
<P>
It was Keranen's obvious success in Amway -- where some estimate he was earning 
$20,000 monthly -- that induced hundreds of people, including many subordinate 
Amway distributors, to pour millions of dollars into his Woodland Hills real 
estate development company, the California Anchor Group. 
</P>
<P>
Lured by promises of receiving interest rates on their investments of 25% or 
more, people grabbed what they thought was the golden ring that would lead to a 
similar lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
Single mothers with limited incomes refinanced their houses to raise a stake; 
professionals -- bankers, doctors, dentists and engineers -- took assets, 
including IRAs, out of safer investments; and senior citizens, fearing 
inflation, gave him their meager nest eggs. 
</P>
<P>
All told, more than 200 people in California, Oregon and Washington poured more 
than $12 million into Cal Anchor. The company, started in 1983 in the midst of 
a hot real estate market, was supposed to build or refurbish, then sell, San 
Fernando Valley apartment buildings at tremendous profits. 
</P>
<P>
But in May, 1987, investors' dreams of luxury turned to financial nightmares 
when Cal Anchor closed the doors of its plush Warner Center office for good, 
after a raid by agents of the U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Keranen and two former vice presidents of the group, Robert Dumas and Ronald 
Stoliar, are to be arraigned today on federal fraud charges for allegedly 
operating what prosecutors said was one of the largest and longest-running 
Ponzi schemes ever in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1920s, a Boston newspaper exposed a former vegetable peddler, Charles 
Ponzi, who ran the first of what came to be known as Ponzi schemes, convincing 
newly arrived immigrants that he could produce a 40% return on their money by 
exploiting a quirk in international postal conventions. In fact, the money 
Ponzi returned to investors came from money provided by later victims. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Cal Anchors' investors were paid their monthly interest with new 
investors' dollars, rather than with revenues from profitable real estate deals 
as they thought, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Anita H. Dymant. 
</P>
<P>
Keranen, who now lives in Beaverton, Ore., where he has started a company 
called Double Win International that sells water filtration devices and 
motivational tapes, referred questions to his lawyer, Richard H. Kirschner. 
</P>
<P>
Kirschner said his client founded Cal Anchor as a legitimate business, then 
entrusted its daily operation to its vice presidents. 
</P>
<P>
"He did not have some clever Machiavellian plan," Kirschner said. "Although he 
realizes the buck stops with him, he was not the one who began or implemented 
what was wrong with the company. He did not run the company on a day-to-day 
basis. He was an absentee manager." 
</P>
<P>
Kirschner, who said his client has no criminal record, portrays Keranen as a 
naive victim, whose talents as a salesman were abused by unscrupulous 
subordinates 
</P>
<P>
"He did recruit the investors . . . but he would be the first to admit that he 
was not a real estate developer, and he left it in the hands of others who he 
thought could do that," the attorney said. "He was victimized." 
</P>
<P>
Kirschner said his client is determined to pay back everyone who lost money in 
Cal Anchor. Nine civil lawsuits -- with more than 100 plaintiffs -- have also 
been filed against Keranen, who filed for bankruptcy in Utah in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Dymant agreed that Keranen's fantastic salesmanship, particularly his success 
in Amway, a direct consumer-marketing company, was a major factor in keeping 
the scheme afloat for nearly four years. 
</P>
<P>
"Normally, a Ponzi scheme will collapse of its own weight sooner, but Keranen 
had a built-in audience of potential investors that was very substantial," 
Dymant said. "He had clout and a credibility that you wouldn't get from another 
investment scheme." 
</P>
<P>
Because he rose quickly within Amway, by selling products and sponsoring many 
new distributors, others thought he had tremendous business acumen and were 
eager to hitch their stars to his. 
</P>
<P>
"He showed the lifestyle that everybody dreamed about," said Corky Bassler, a 
West Hills printer and Amway distributor who invested $140,000 in Cal Anchor. 
"He was a very dynamic person." 
</P>
<P>
Before joining Amway, Keranen, who is married and has two young boys, was a 
high school football coach in Oregon for several years, his attorney said. He 
began selling life insurance and after that borrowed money to begin a computer 
software sales business. 
</P>
<P>
But Keranen suffered a major setback when his car was rear-ended by a bus on 
the freeway and his neck was broken. 
</P>
<P>
"Through sheer will and determination, he managed to get himself out of bed in 
two months," Kirschner said. "He could have gone into bankruptcy at that time, 
but he vowed to pay everybody he owed." 
</P>
<P>
It was shortly after the accident, in 1981, that Keranen got involved with 
Amway, and he built a flourishing business in a phenomenally short time, other 
Amway distributors said. They estimated that when Keranen founded Cal Anchor -- 
two years after he had joined Amway -- he was earning nearly $20,000 a month 
with the business. 
</P>
<P>
With a super-optimistic, can-do attitude, Keranen became a popular motivational 
speaker at Amway gatherings where he shared his life story. He also sold tapes, 
with such titles as "You Too Can Be a Millionaire." 
</P>
<P>
Even now, Cal Anchor investors remember him as "dynamic," "bigger-than-life," 
the "stereotypical back-slapping salesman" and a powerful speaker. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the type of guy that gets up in front of a large group and says, 
'Honey, you can own the world,' " said a 47-year-old single mother who lost her 
North Hollywood house when Cal Anchor collapsed. "His Rolex watch was certainly 
a symbol of his strength." 
</P>
<P>
A West Hills physician and former Amway distributor who asked that his name not 
be used said that "people trusted Keranen because he was in a network of people 
that were mostly nice, honest-working people." Keranen was "surrounded by all 
this legitimacy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was Keranen's reputation and prestige in Amway that kept Cal Anchor running; 
it was when Keranen was kicked out of Amway, in March, 1987, that Cal Anchor 
began to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Keranen was asked to leave Amway because he had violated company policy by 
recruiting distributors whom he had not personally sponsored into Cal Anchor, 
company spokeswoman Kim Bruyn said. But, she said, Amway officials were unaware 
that Cal Anchor was not a legitimate business. 
</P>
<P>
"Word spread like wildfire" that Keranen had been forced to leave Amway, Dymant 
said. Suddenly, Keranen could not attract any new investors, and the next 
month's interest checks all bounced, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Two months later, in May, 1987, federal investigators raided the office and the 
company shut down for good. 
</P>
<P>
When the scheme collapsed, investors who had refinanced their houses to raise 
investment money lost them. Others, who had been told by Keranen that they 
could roll their IRAs over into Cal Anchor, had to pay huge penalties to the 
IRS. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Mathis, 56, a Milpitas engineer, lost his savings of about $120,000 and 
paid penalties for investing his IRA in Cal Anchor. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Anchor interest checks had allowed Raymond Rothschild, 62, to close his 
West Los Angeles dental practice and take an early retirement. He bought a 
condo in Palm Springs and began eating at expensive restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
"The money was coming in and here I was spending it like a kid at Disneyland. 
Little did I know it was my own money," Rothschild said. The collapse cost 
Rothschild and his mother a total of $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bassler, who once flew in Keranen's private plane to the Utah ski cabin for a 
weekend getaway, said he left his job as a marketing director for a 
check-producing firm because "Al convinced me that I could make the same kind 
of money by living off the interest, and on commissions I would make by helping 
him sell investments." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, he is back in the printing business, but "I don't have any 
retirement" money left. 
</P>
<P>
Even though they lost their shirts, some people still insist Keranen was 
basically an honest man, obsessed with keeping his word. 
</P>
<P>
Bassler said that Keranen in his lectures and tapes repeatedly stressed the 
importance of fulfilling a promise. "He . . . said that if you can give them 
your word and keep it, that is the way things should be done," Bassler said. 
</P>
<P>
When real estate sales failed to generate the income he needed to keep his 
promises, some victims speculate, Keranen began tapping new investors as an 
income source. "I don't think he planned to steal people's money," Bassler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutor Dymant said that although the group did purchase some 
properties, mostly in the northeast San Fernando Valley, new investors' money 
was paid to earlier investors from the beginning. The properties were later 
lost in foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
"There was never a time during the operation of this company when the real 
estate interest was enough to pay the investors," Dymant said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, many of the investors blame themselves for their losses, saying they had 
trusted Keranen with their money without adequately investigating the company. 
</P>
<P>
"Each and every one of us has to 'fess up to being greedy," said the single 
mother who lost her North Hollywood house and now lives in Los Angeles. "We 
were all victims, yet at the same time, we all went and willingly participated 
in this adventure." 
</P>
<P>
But others said that they did their best to verify that Cal Anchor was 
legitimate. They said that the promised rates of return were reasonable in the 
1980s real estate market in the Valley.

The West Hills physician, who with his mother-in-law lost $600,000, said of the 
scheme: "It was very hard to see through, very hard to read as being crooked. I 
guess the lesson here is that if it seems too good to be true, it is probably 
too good to be true."

OLD-TIME FAIR TO RETURN TO HANSEN DAM AREA JULY 18 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The San Fernando Valley Fair, complete with a midway and live entertainment, 
will return for a second year to Hansen Dam Recreation Area, which fair 
officials hope will someday become the event's permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
The fair will run July 18-22 and will be "a celebration of old-time Americana," 
said Ted Naumann, a spokesman for the 51st District Agricultural Assn., the 
state agency that runs the fair. 
</P>
<P>
It will include arts and crafts booths, homemaking exhibits, children's rides, 
a horse show, a hog-calling contest and a petting zoo. There will be 2,000 
exhibits, including animals raised by local 4-H Clubs and Future Farmers of 
America chapters. No alcoholic beverages will be sold. 
</P>
<P>
A smaller, three-day version of the fair, without the popular carnival 
attractions, was held at Hansen Dam's sports complex and outdoor theater area 
last year after the event was ousted from its former home, Devonshire Downs in 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The hastily organized event was moved to the site in the northeast San Fernando 
Valley after a plan to hold the fair at Pierce College in Woodland Hills fell 
through at the last minute because of homeowner protests. The smaller fair drew 
about 30,000 visitors, down from 70,000 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Although skeptical before the event, homeowners in the Hansen Dam area said 
they had no complaints about the smaller fair and are now willing to support 
fair expansion. As a result, fair officials now hope to make the site the 
event's permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
But delays by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which owns the dam property and 
leases part of it to the Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department, in 
planning for development of the 1,540-acre flood-control basin as a recreation 
area have kept any formal proposal to build permanent fair facilities there on 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone recognizes that the eastern rim represents the last bastion of rural 
lifestyle in the Valley," Naumann said. "The fair fits in there." 
</P>
<P>
The idea is supported by homeowner groups. "Last year, we asked them not to 
have a midway or live concerts and to make the fair smaller," said Phyllis 
Hines, land use chairwoman of the Lake View Terrace Improvement Assn., which 
represents some neighboring homeowners. "There were few problems then, so all 
we asked this year is that they have no liquor, and they agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been very, very cooperative with us," she said. "We really hope it's 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
Hines and Lewis Snow, president of the Lake View Terrace Home Owners Assn., 
said the fair would be a good addition to the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Many northeast San Fernando Valley residents also want to see a lake restored 
at the dam. The former 130-acre boating and swimming lake was closed in 1982 
after two decades of heavy rains brought millions of tons of debris into the 
basin. 
</P>
<P>
Snow and Hines expressed impatience with the Corps of Engineers' delays in 
issuing preliminary plans for the site. The plans are necessary before the 
lake, or any other facilities such as fairgrounds, can be planned there. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never been more frustrated in my career as an activist as I have been 
with Hansen Dam," Snow said. 
</P>
<P>
A corps spokeswoman said a draft plan for the recreation area -- primarily 
viewed by the corps as a flood-control basin -- was scheduled to be issued in 
May but has been delayed several months, mainly because of personnel changes. 
</P>
<P>
When the plan is complete, the corps will conduct hearings on the plan at which 
fair officials and the public will have a chance to argue for building the 
fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't even begin to design a proposed fairgrounds until we know where the 
Army Corps will allow 'high-intensity' uses," Naumann told members of Snow's 
homeowner group in May. Fair directors are "just as frustrated as you are," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Naumann said in an interview that the city parks department, which operates 
recreational programs at the dam, favors locating the fairgrounds there. He 
also said the agricultural district now has about $15 million -- to be matched 
by the state -- which it can use to acquire or develop a permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
The fair was evicted in 1988 after 14 years at Devonshire Downs to make room 
for an expansion planned by Cal State Northridge, which owns the property. 
</P>
<P>
What resulted in the move to Hansen Dam was a scaled-down, old-fashioned fair, 
which pleased Hansen Dam's neighbors and many fair-goers. 
</P>
<P>
"The surroundings made you feel you were in the country. You weren't looking at 
condominiums and asphalt," said Steve Pietrolongo, an agriculture teacher at 
Canoga Park High School who has several students entering animals in this 
year's fair. 
</P>
<P>
In the fair's 1990 exhibit entry guide, Sal Buccieri, president of the fair's 
board of directors, promised that this year's event will protect "the wholesome 
family experience." 
</P>
<P>
Mel Simas, program coordinator for the fair, has scheduled covered wagon rides, 
an exhibit by the Model A Clubs of America, a National Horseshoe Pitching Assn. 
tournament, coloring contests for children, whistling contests and musical 
washboard and saw-playing competitions. Also on the bill is a show of rats and 
mice, featuring about 200 short-haired and curly-haired rodents that have been 
bred as pets. 
</P>
<P>
Community members have been invited to work at the fair's carnival games of 
skill to raise money for their nonprofit organizations. And the Lake View 
Terrace Improvement Assn., under Hines' direction, is planning a pavilion that 
will showcase recycling and environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment will include the Parachute Express, a children's variety show; a 
sock hop reunion featuring Tiny Tim, Bobby Day and other musicians of the past; 
and concerts by country singer Johnny Rodriguez and a band called Michael Wolf 
and the Posse. 
</P>
<P>
Hours will be from noon to 10:30 p.m. July 18-20 and from 10 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. 
July 21 and 22. Admission is $5 for ages 11 and older. Children 10 and younger 
will be admitted free. Parking is $2 a car. 
</P>
<P>
The fair is attempting "to re-establish a very carefully themed fair," Naumann 
said. "We've learned not to try to be all things to all people. 
</P>
<P>
Hines said that if fair officials continue to cooperate with the community, she 
believes they will succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I took my 83-year-old father on opening day," she said. "But there 
were no benches, and I had to take him home in a couple of hours. I called Ted 
Naumann about the benches. The next day, there were benches all over the place. 
That's the kind of cooperation we're getting."

ROBBINS SUED OVER PROPERTY PURCHASE; 
</P>
<P>
DISPUTE: A BUSINESSMAN ALLEGES THAT ROBBINS THREATENED TO USE POLITICAL CLOUT 
TO PREVENT HIM FROM DEVELOPING ACREAGE NEAR MARINA DEL REY. ROBBINS DENIES 
TRYING TO THWART THE DEAL.

<P>
State Sen. Alan Robbins warned a Newport Beach businessman trying to buy and 
develop choice property near Marina del Rey that he "would never get" a crucial 
government permit because the lawmaker wanted to acquire the land himself, the 
businessman has charged in court papers. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Blake also said Robbins (D-Tarzana) boasted that he had former Los 
Angeles City Council President Pat Russell "tied up" in connection with his 
efforts from 1985 to 1987 to buy 16 acres located along Lincoln Boulevard. The 
property is subject to city planning rules. 
</P>
<P>
Blake's allegations are contained in documents filed recently as part of a 
complex web of civil lawsuits involving Blake, Robbins and a wealthy La Jolla 
car dealer, Jeremy Simms. The three were partners in a 3,800-acre parcel of 
Ventura County land that sold last year for $22 million. The profits from the 
sale also are a subject of the suits. 
</P>
<P>
The litigation -- which already includes enough paper work to form a stack more 
than three feet high -- recently prompted the state attorney general's office 
to reopen a 1988 investigation that cleared Robbins of allegations that he 
illegally used campaign funds to help finance the Ventura County deal. 
</P>
<P>
No trial dates have been set in the suits, the bulk of which are pending in 
Santa Monica Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Robbins denied that he tried to thwart Blake over the Lincoln 
Boulevard land. He said he didn't even meet Blake until after he, Robbins, had 
signed a deal to purchase the first group of properties he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, Robbins and a different partner purchased the 
land for $12.2 million and sold it last year for a reported $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran lawmaker amassed a considerable fortune before and during his 17 
years in the state Senate. He is a lawyer and licensed real estate broker, and 
he and a succession of partners have financed apartment complexes, medical 
buildings and office towers. 
</P>
<P>
Blake said in court papers that Robbins complained that Blake's attempts to buy 
the land were "messing up" efforts by Robbins' firm, Marina East Holding 
Properties, to acquire it. 
</P>
<P>
Blake said Robbins told him the property could be developed only if the 
successful buyer "got a left-turn lane authorized for entrance and various 
other governmental approvals." 
</P>
<P>
"He added that if I got the property, and his group lost it, I would never get 
the left-hand turn lane and might have a difficult time in obtaining other 
required approvals," Blake said in court papers. "He told me that if we took 
the property from him, he would make sure it would not be worth our while." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said, however, that the property Blake was trying to buy actually was a 
different property, adjacent to parcels Robbins already had signed deals to 
acquire. 
</P>
<P>
He said Blake wanted to erect a hotel on the land and asked Robbins for 
permission to build a driveway through Robbins' lots. The lawmaker agreed, but 
Blake was never able to carry out the hotel deal, Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
"What we negotiated about him buying was access to private property," Robbins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Former City Council President Russell, who was defeated for reelection in 1987, 
laughed when told of Blake's charge as it related to her. She said she talked 
to Robbins about the land only after he purchased it and that she "would have 
blown a fuse" if the lawmaker had tried to enlist her political influence to 
cripple Blake's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people would laugh at the idea that Robbins had me tied up," she said. "I 
think I still have a reputation that you can't get me tied up." 
</P>
<P>
Blake said he eventually dropped his bid for the Lincoln Boulevard property and 
Robbins offered to provide him with "various profitable business 
opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Blake became a partner with Robbins and Simms in a company that owned 
the Ventura County acreage, he said. The land, near Moorpark, was once part of 
the Strathearn cattle ranch. 
</P>
<P>
In court papers, a lawyer for Simms, the car dealer, said Robbins "brought 
Blake into the Moorpark deal to get rid of him in the Marina deal." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins and Simms purchased the Strathearn property in 1985, buying out a 
previous owner who paid $300,000 for it. But last year, they filed suit against 
each other after the ranch was sold to another firm for about $22 million. 
</P>
<P>
Simms' lawyer said in court papers that Robbins withdrew from the Strathearn 
project and agreed to relinquish his share of profits in it in early 1988, when 
the state was investigating whether he had improperly benefited by loaning 
campaign funds to political and business associates, including Blake. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins was cleared of any wrongdoing in March, 1988, after telling state 
investigators that he had no equity interest in the ranchland and therefore 
could not have benefited from loans to Blake, his erstwhile partner in the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
However, state Assistant Atty. Gen. N. Eugene Hill said his office reopened its 
probe after Robbins claimed in a lawsuit he filed against Simms last August 
that he still is entitled to some profits from the ranch's sale. 
</P>
<P>
"He alleges an interest that was inconsistent . . . with the statements that 
were made to us" during the earlier investigation, Hill said. He said his 
office was informed of Robbins' new claim by a lawyer for Simms. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted of having used campaign funds for personal gain, Robbins would be 
subject to a fine of twice the amount of the misused money. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins said he should share in the ranch profits because after he withdrew 
from the deal in 1988, he lent Simms $1.4 million to help prepare the land for 
development. 
</P>
<P>
In court documents, Robbins' lawyer characterized the lawmaker's 1988 
withdrawal from the Strathearn deal as a "short-term break" in a four-year 
partnership between him and Simms in the land deal. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmaker said he is confident that he will be cleared again of any 
improprieties.

Campaign funds -- A June 25 Times story on state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) 
incorrectly characterized the penalty for personal use of campaign funds. The 
penalty is a civil fine of up to twice the amount of money misused. It is not a 
criminal conviction. FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
Property transaction -- Stories published June 25 and July 9 misstated the 
acreage in a Venice property transaction involving state Sen. Alan Robbins 
(D-Tarzana). The articles said Robbins' partnership bought a 16-acre parcel for 
$12.2 million and sold it for $45 million. In fact, the partnership purchased 
five acres for $12.2 million and, after acquiring other parcels, sold a total 
of 16 acres for $45 million.

MARSHALLESE CULTURE CENTER WILL BE BUILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County will probably get its first consulate in about a year, and the 
event may do more for geographical literacy than a dozen PBS travelogues. 
</P>
<P>
Got your atlas ready? Look up the Marshall Islands (hint: between Hawaii and 
Guam). It's a collection of 29 atolls and 1,225 tiny islands with a land mass 
of about 70 square miles in the central Pacific, home to approximately 43,300 
Marshallese. 
</P>
<P>
It's also the homeland of about 375 expatriate Marshallese who live in or near 
Costa Mesa and who make up the largest concentration of Marshall Islands 
natives in the continental United States. 
</P>
<P>
The local Marshallese came to Orange County over the last 15 years mainly to go 
to college, and most have stayed on. 
</P>
<P>
But their ties to the islands and island culture -- and to each other -- remain 
strong. 
</P>
<P>
They get together frequently for meetings, parties, dances, cultural events, 
birthdays, anniversaries, weddings -- almost any excuse for a bit of 
socializing with the home crowd. 
</P>
<P>
So when the idea for a centralized Marshall Islands cultural center in the 
Costa Mesa area came up about a year ago, it quickly reached the ears of the 
Marshallese government and Marshall Islands President Amata Kabua. And the idea 
for a second use of the center began to take shape. 
</P>
<P>
Since the arrival of the Marshallese, Orange County has been considered a kind 
of cultural and economic touchstone, a link between the islands and the United 
States. Because of these ties, said Kabua, the cultural center seemed the 
perfect place to establish a consulate. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very appealing to us," said Kabua during a visit to Orange County early 
this month. "It's gratifying to know that we have friends here who can assist 
us." 
</P>
<P>
Kabua and his minister of foreign affairs, Tom Kijiner, made a stop in Orange 
County on the way to Washington, D.C., to dedicate the new Marshall Islands 
embassy there. Kijiner said the consulate, like the embassy in the U.S. 
capital, is expected to give the Marshall Islands greater visibility and higher 
recognition among Americans, particularly American business people and 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a dream," said Kijiner, "and it's been a dream for a while now. We 
need more of these consulates in the United States to take care of our people 
and to get business activities going between the people back home and United 
States companies. We are looking to the future, and we see that the western 
part of the United States, with the (business) development of the Pacific Rim, 
will be the center of the country as far as we're concerned. We're looking at 
both sides of things, the cultural and the economic." 
</P>
<P>
The cultural center-consulate would be built on land in a county corridor off 
Bristol Street that is owned by Jerry Barto, a real estate developer from 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
A financing plan has not been worked out yet, said Barto, but a likely option 
would be joint funding by the local Marshallese community (to cover the 
expenses associated with the parts of the project used for a cultural center) 
and the Marshall Islands government (to cover the consulate offices). 
</P>
<P>
The proposed two-story structure would include meeting areas and a stage on the 
first floor to accommodate approximately 400 people, as well as Marshallese 
dance and musical groups. Upstairs would be offices for use by both the local 
Marshallese club, called Jake Jabol Eo, and consular officials. 
</P>
<P>
The center still is not a sure thing, but Kijiner said that "things seem to 
have fallen into place. I'm very optimistic that it will happen."

REMAKING 'NBC NIGHTLY NEWS'; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE NETWORK IS PUTTING ITS FAITH IN NEW EXECUTIVE PRODUCER STEVE 
FRIEDMAN, WHOSE WINNING TOUCH MADE THE 'TODAY' SHOW NO. 1 FOR FIVE YEARS. 
</P>

<P>
They used to throw baseballs as well as ideas around Steve Friedman's office 
during his heyday on the "Today" show. Friedman, a rotund, funny pooh-bah of an 
executive producer, would use a baseball bat as a gavel, banging it against a 
heating vent above his head to make a point or to call a meeting to disorder. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Steve wanted to mark the territory, saying, 'My manners are going to 
be terrible, my appearance is going to be slovenly, and I'm not going to bow at 
the altar of journalism -- I do television,' " explains Jane Pauley, whom 
Friedman paired with Bryant Gumbel on the morning broadcast in 1981. "In fact, 
Steve is the one who returned 'Today' to being a news program in the early 
1980s. Steve's Barnum &amp; Bailey routine brought us resources, and it made 
Bryant and me look like coming attractions at a time when we weren't exactly 
overnight sensations in the ratings." 
</P>
<P>
During Friedman's seven-year tenure on "Today," the show rose in the ratings 
from third place to first and stayed there for five years. 
</P>
<P>
A regular observer of Friedman's office follies was Tom Brokaw, whom Friedman 
dubbed "The Prince of News." The two have been friends since they met in 1969 
at KNBC Channel 4 in Los Angeles, Friedman a news writer and Brokaw a handsome 
young anchor. They worked together then, again at the "Today" show and now find 
themselves paired once more. Friedman began work three weeks ago as executive 
producer of "NBC Nightly News With Tom Brokaw." 
</P>
<P>
"I remember Steve as a smart-mouth right off the streets of Chicago," Brokaw 
recalls. "He was good company, and he knew what he was doing." 
</P>
<P>
Brokaw and Friedman joined forces at KNBC to sell their local spots to "Today" 
for $25 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom was all over the place at KNBC," Friedman recalls. "He became Mr. 
California Politics for the network because he told people that Reagan was 
going to win the presidency. Tom would fly to Sacramento to do a piece for the 
network, then come back that day to anchor the news. Other times, he'd walk 
into the station at 10:30 at night after going to a party at Warren Beatty's! 
He was smooth." 
</P>
<P>
Two years after he left NBC to produce a syndicated version of "USA Today" that 
proved to be a $50-million failure, Friedman is back at the network, 71 pounds 
lighter than a year ago, more modest but unbowed. NBC executives are hoping 
that he can do for the third-place "Nightly News" what he did for "Today." 
</P>
<P>
Introduced to the owners of NBC stations at the network's recent annual 
affiliates convention, Friedman said that he could imagine what the audience 
was thinking: "Which Steve Friedman have you got -- the genius who helped put 
'Today' back on top, or the bozo who produced 'USA Today'?" 
</P>
<P>
Highly touted as the first venture between "USA Today" founder Al Neuharth and 
former NBC chairman Grant Tinker, "USA Today" was panned by critics as all 
flash and no substance. "I think Steve realizes that he caused a nine-car wreck 
with 'USA Today,' " observes Brokaw. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned from my mistake on 'USA Today,' " Friedman says. "I had thought 
that form mattered more than content. People may think that I've been brought 
in to soften 'Nightly News.' In fact, I'm going to harden it up." 
</P>
<P>
A key element in the plans for "Nightly News" is to have Brokaw travel more to 
news events around the world, anchoring from there while Jane Pauley serves as 
"sub-anchor," reading the rest of the newscast from New York. For instance, 
Brokaw anchored the newscast from San Francisco during Soviet President Mikhail 
Gorbachev's visit there, while Pauley was in New York. On July 2-4, Brokaw will 
anchor from the Soviet Party Congress in the U.S.S.R. and then travel to 
London, the site of the NATO summit, on July 5 and 6. Pauley will be the 
sub-anchor July 5-6; Faith Daniels will be sub-anchor when Pauley is not 
available on July 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
Pauley, who has been the principal substitute for Brokaw since she left "Today" 
at the beginning of the year, also will continue in that role when he is on 
vacation or away for other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Pauley's expanded role, plus her increased popularity post-"Today," has led to 
speculation that NBC is planning to put her on "Nightly News" alongside Brokaw 
as a full-fledged co-anchor. Not so, say Brokaw, Friedman and Pauley. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no plans for Jane to co-anchor," says Friedman. "If there were, I'd 
be the guy doing it. The show is being redesigned around Tom's strengths. He's 
our best reporter, and people like to see him out on the story when there's a 
big news event. Having Jane there will allow us to take a chance on letting Tom 
go to places where we think news will be breaking and to stories such as the 
recent trip to Mt. St. Helens, where we define the story as news." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased to have Jane on board," says Brokaw, who is a good friend of 
Pauley's and introduced her to her future husband, cartoonist Garry Trudeau. 
"I've told her exactly how I feel. In 22 minutes, whether it's me or Jane or 
Willard Scott anchoring the news, I just don't think there's enough time to 
divide up the news with a co-anchor." 
</P>
<P>
"Being co-anchor of 'NBC Nightly News' is not an option for me whether my own 
magazine program succeeds or not," says Pauley, who is doing five prime-time 
specials this summer as part of her projected prime-time series, to begin in 
January. "I haven't been asked to be co-anchor, but I feel the need to be so 
emphatic because the speculation implies that Tom needs a co-anchor and implies 
that my own program isn't to be taken seriously. Tom's role on 'Nightly' is not 
my best skill. Although I'm happy to help the organization cover the news in 
the way it does best, the magazine show is my job. And, besides that, having 
made the decision to have three children, the deal I've made with them is that 
I'm not going to get home so late at night that I only see them in their 
pajamas." 
</P>
<P>
Friedman has other changes in mind for "Nightly News," however. With all three 
evening newscasts facing declining shares of the TV audience, he notes, the 
networks can't afford to open the program with the anchor saying, "Good 
evening. Unemployment is down" because viewers will already have heard that on 
their local stations or on Cable News Network. To differentiate the NBC 
newscast, Brokaw will conduct more live, "Nightline"-style interviews from the 
studio. The program will showcase the work of such specialists as investigative 
reporter Brian Ross. 
</P>
<P>
And there will be regularly scheduled features. In September, Friedman plans to 
introduce what he calls "the daily difference," daily segments on such topics 
as health and medicine, and the "Friday follow," updating news stories. Similar 
to ABC's "American Agenda" features, the lengthier segments will air on regular 
days except when there is a major news event. 
</P>
<P>
Some signs of Friedman's humor already are evident in the program's graphics. 
After a recent end-piece on the new popularity of animated cartoons, the 
"Nightly News" logo that night had lettering like an old Warner Bros. cartoon. 
Purists may complain, but, says Brokaw, "I don't think it's bad to have a 
little humor on occasion." On a recent afternoon in Friedman's "Nightly News" 
office, Brokaw met quietly with Friedman and other producers on the program to 
discuss a multipart series on the new Germany and other upcoming stories. The 
atmosphere was convivial, but there were no projectiles. "This is no picnic," 
Friedman explained later. "The baseballs came after 'Today' was functioning 
smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
But don't think he's subdued. Friedman just bought a new bat.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: NO CIGAR FOR TURNER'S CASTRO 'CONVERSATION'; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE USUALLY VOLUBLE CNN FOUNDER JUST LOBS UP SOFT QUESTIONS AND 
LISTENS TO THE LONG-WINDED CUBAN LEADER'S ANSWERS TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
We learn from Ted Turner's interview with Fidel Castro that Turner can listen 
as well as talk. 
</P>
<P>
In "A Conversation With Fidel Castro" at 6 tonight on CNN, the Cuban President 
talks . . . and talks . . . and talks, while Turner -- whose own nonstop 
verbosity is legendary -- this time listens . . . and listens . . . and 
listens. 
</P>
<P>
CNN-founder Turner's interview with Castro was taped in Havana during Turner's 
June 8-10 visit to Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
This duel of epic talkers is a massacre from the start. Assisted by 
simultaneous translations, they face off in leather chairs, with Turner the 
batting-practice pitcher lobbing mostly soft ones across the plate and Castro, 
speaking through an interpreter, blasting them out of sight. You eye the 
bullpen, but no one's warming up. 
</P>
<P>
One appreciates any TV interview that liberates its participants from the 
tyranny of the sound bite without deteriorating into a noisy debate that 
eclipses the person being interviewed. Just as the Bush Administration has 
attempted to invade Cuba via Radio Marti and now TV Marti, moreover, it's only 
proper that Castro get a crack at the United States through CNN. Furthermore, 
some of Castro's global observations and criticisms of the United States have 
merit. 
</P>
<P>
Yet this program is much less the "conversation" promised by CNN than a Castro 
monologue. Turner is his all-but-silent prop, appearing at times to ask 
questions from a TelePrompTer or cue cards, then sitting through the lengthy 
responses, his eyes glazing into shiny mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
Boy, this journalist business is grueling. Popping a few questions is one 
thing, but no one told Turner he'd have to sit there and endure the answers. 
</P>
<P>
With all the legitimate journalists at CNN's command, why is Turner sitting 
there? 
</P>
<P>
"We know Castro watches CNN on his satellite dish," a CNN spokesman said. "So 
we've been asking him for an interview for years, and been getting turned down. 
No matter what correspondent we'd suggest, he'd say no. Finally, we suggested 
Ted, and that changed his mind." 
</P>
<P>
Smart guy, Castro. 
</P>
<P>
Other than the Cuban leader in effect getting to chose his interviewer, no 
preconditions were set down by Castro, CNN said. None needed. In an hour 
displacing "Larry King Live" (and which repeats at 1 a.m.), Castro is never 
pressed or challenged. CNN could have achieved the same result by mailing the 
questions to Havana and having Castro read his responses to the camera. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Turner's contributions to the "conversation," as it were, were edited 
out of the version of the interview airing tonight. They are contained in a 
transcript of an earlier version that's otherwise almost identical to 
tonight's. 
</P>
<P>
These omitted comments are noteworthy only because they indicate Turner's frame 
of mind and friendliness as an interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
In the transcript, which CNN provided, Turner is quoted either thanking Castro 
after each of Castro's replies ("Thank you for that difficult answer") or 
stating his own agreement with the answer, as in "This is true" or "Touche." 
</P>
<P>
The latter comes after Castro, while endorsing the dismantling of the Berlin 
Wall, draws a questionable analogy between it and such other "walls" as 
economic blockades and the controversial U.S. campaign to seal its border with 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Castro: "When will that wall disappear, which is much more difficult to 
overcome than the Berlin Wall?" 
</P>
<P>
A more aggressive interviewer would call Castro on that, distinguishing between 
walls that keep citizens in and those that, rightly or wrongly, keep 
non-citizens out or that bar trade. From this interviewer, however, there are 
no dissents or follow-ups, even when Castro masterfully pirouettes around 
Turner's question about violence in China's Tien An Mien Square by attacking 
the United States. Like a teacher, Castro lectures and ,like a student, Turner 
nods. Or perhaps he's nodding off. 
</P>
<P>
Turner is one of TV's greatest visionaries and nobody's fool. He deserves 
credit not only for creating CNN but also for being that rare mogul who thinks 
cosmically while being as devoted to social causes as the bottom line. And 
obviously, the thinking was that Castro/Turner was better than no Castro at 
all. Well . . . maybe. 
</P>
<P>
For a broader, more searching view of the topic, try "Castro's Cuba: Two Views" 
in August, a PBS packaging of two highly opinionated films with clashing 
perspectives. Saul Landau's "The Uncompromising Revolution" is sympathetic to 
Cuba under Castro, while "Nobody Listened" by Nestor Almendros and Jorge Ulla 
is a bitter condemnation of Castro's human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
But first comes Turner. "Hi," he begins. "I'm Ted Turner, and I've just spent 
two very interesting days here in Cuba traveling around with President Fidel 
Castro. . . ." The interview wasn't much, but they'll always have Havana.

'AS YOU LIKE IT' OPENS GLOBE SEASON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Old Globe Theatre is beginning its summer season with an end-of-summer 
staging of "As You Like It." 
</P>
<P>
Set in the alfresco Lowell Davies Festival Theatre, this "As You Like It" is 
bountiful, well-spoken and without major surprises -- unless it's the fact that 
the production's overriding melancholy is underplayed in the one character, 
Jaques, where it's most needed. 
</P>
<P>
The hints of incipient autumn are established by David Jenkins' set. In the 
first scene, the apples have been harvested and are being pressed into cider. 
The leaves are beginning to fall from the trees in the Forest of Arden. And 
then there is the matter of the deer. 
</P>
<P>
Director Julianne Boyd and Jenkins were not content to simply let us hear 
Shakespeare's lines about Jaques' grief over a hunter's wounding of a deer in 
the forest. In one of the first scenes, before we even enter the forest, 
Rosalind and Celia play badminton against the backdrop of a formal garden that 
includes a bush sculpted in the form of a stag. 
</P>
<P>
As we near the end of the play, the banished duke's merry men not only sing a 
bawdy little ditty in honor of the fellow who killed the deer, but they 
actually bear the creature's headless corpse across the stage. The triumphant 
young hunter smears his hands and face with the deer's blood. After the merry 
men go on their way, leaving the deer on stage, Jaques comes forward and 
touches the animal's neck in a moment of silent sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
This scene effectively ends the notion of the forest as the halcyon retreat 
that it might resemble in the spring. Instead, this is a bloody place, where 
the food chain continues operating, where even those men who claim to love 
nature don't hesitate to exert their dominion over it. In this world, the faux 
deer (as sculpted in the garden) threatens to outlive the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
Jaques more or less articulates this point of view throughout the play. But 
this production's Jaques, Richard Kneeland, isn't the right man to embody it. 
Kneeland speaks Jaques' lines, including those about the seven ages of man, 
with grace and precision, but he doesn't look particularly glum. His eyes don't 
appear haunted. He carries himself with a bearing not much different from his 
stout-hearted comrades. 
</P>
<P>
It's a curious lapse in an otherwise well-cast staging. The magnificently 
wall-eyed Richard Easton is a superb Touchstone, suggesting the professional 
fool's wit, his hauteur, his carnality. Robert Phalen plays both the bad duke 
and his brother, the banished good duke, with conviction. The physical 
resemblance between the dukes may help us swallow the bad duke's sudden 
offstage conversion at the end of the play; they were cut of the same cloth, 
right? Well. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Any "As You like It" hinges on its Rosalind, and Jayne Atkinson is spirited 
enough to carry off the disguise as a man -- observe the gymnastic workout she 
and Michel R. Gill's Orlando go through during her speech about the volatile 
moods of married women -- yet she is also feminine enough to make us see the 
studied aspect of her disguise. More important, in her private moments, we 
believe both her cynicism and her lovesickness. We see the anxiety behind her 
little charade: Will Orlando like her as she is? Will she like him? Will the 
real romance work out, or even be as much fun, as the fake one? With Gill's 
Orlando, this is an open question. He's perfectly handsome -- too perfect, 
perhaps, for this Rosalind. There are no character lines on his face. He looks 
several years younger and several dimensions shallower than Atkinson's 
Rosalind. 
</P>
<P>
As Celia, Katherine Leask elicits many of the play's chuckles, not only with 
her insinuating glances and artificial smiles during Rosalind's byplay with 
Orlando, but even with the simple statement that she's too tired to keep 
walking. The performances in the pastoral roles are also little comic gems: 
especially Pippa Pearthree as Phebe, Charley Lang as Silvius and M. Susan Peck 
as Audrey. Ed Hall's Corin retains a degree of dignity in the face of the 
supercilious Touchstone; Jonathan McMurtry is the noble old Adam. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Nichols fares as well as can be expected as the villainous brother who 
so thoroughly reforms. For his interrogation by the bad duke, the stage opens 
up and he's escorted to and from from his dungeon in a glare of light and a 
wave of smoke. In a punitive environment like this, his knavery isn't hard to 
understand. The program sets the play in the 1630s, possibly suggesting 
Cromwellian repression to come. 
</P>
<P>
The play's other Oliver, an itinerant parson played by Nicholas Martin, gets 
more than his share of laughs with the assistance of a clever prop, and 
Martin's lisping LeBeau gets his with the aid of an outlandish outfit devised 
by Robert Wojewodski. 
</P>
<P>
The costumes are lush, Conrad Susa's score is tuneful, and Peter Maradudin's 
lights finally illuminate the forest behind the stage. In other words, this is 
"As You Like It" as most of us like it -- but the image of that unfortunate 
deer will linger, bringing us back down to earth.

A WRITHING L.A. DEBUT FOR MANCHESTER'S HOUSE-MUSIC SOUND; 
</P>
<P>
CLUBS: STAR DEEJAY GRAEME PARK BRINGS RECORDS FROM ENGLAND'S LEGENDARY HACIENDA 
NIGHTSPOT TO THE MAYAN.

<P>
Every city gets its very own Summer of Love eventually. The sound track for 
this year's model -- the world-famous house-music sound of Manchester, England 
-- made its official Los Angeles debut Friday night at the smoky Mayan dance 
club downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Sixties-style banners hung from the Mayan's impressive stone Meso-American 
deities. Scantily clothed go-go dancers writhed on platforms and, most 
important, Graeme Park, one of the star deejays from Manchester's legendary 
Hacienda club, brought his records. 
</P>
<P>
The few in the crowd who dressed for the occasion -- more in the Alice in 
Wonderland mode of L.A.'s own floating, underground acid scene than in the 
bell-bottoms and sweat shirts associated with the Manchester thing -- were 
dogged throughout the evening by news crews and photographers. 
</P>
<P>
And the boom-chick beats, sketchy syncopated synthesizer fills and heavily 
treated female vocals that spun out over the Mayan's overtaxed sound system 
were absolutely business as usual -- the drony lingua franca of dance clubs all 
over the world. 
</P>
<P>
Like punk rock, acid house -- the forebear of this music -- is wholly 
democratic in its simplicity. Its musicians need no training, no ideas, no 
native intelligence to become famous, just an interesting record collection, a 
$200 sampling synthesizer and the moxie to get up on stage. 
</P>
<P>
The acid-house beat was relentless and predictable to the point that, in live 
shows, laymen couldn't discern when one artist stopped and another began 
without looking at the stage. Plus, gigs were almost always illegal, which 
added an element of adventure. 
</P>
<P>
The new Manchester house sound is the gentrified flip side of all that -- New 
Wave to acid house's punk, requiring more professional skill from the musicians 
but less commitment by the audience: less-specialized clothing, less-extreme 
lifestyle, fewer dangerous drugs. 
</P>
<P>
On the dance floor Friday, the music -- all supplied by records -- almost, but 
not quite, approached that trance-like disco ideal of the beat that never ends, 
but the seams between songs were too clumsy and the arty bits too obtrusive. If 
this show is any indication, the disco portion of the Manchester thing seems 
less a Summer of Love than the winter of our discontent.

MARTIN CO. SOARS WITH 'ALVIN,' STRUGGLES WITH 'VISIONS' AT INNER CITY 
</P>

<P>
When they're good, the Martin Dancers/Dancnicians are very good, but when 
they're bad, they reek. Over the weekend at the Inner City Cultural Center, 
they were both. 
</P>
<P>
There was an arresting premiere of a lengthy selection from Section A of "A 
Suite for Alvin", an athletic exploration of the techniques developed by Alvin 
Ailey's mentor, the late Lester Horton. 
</P>
<P>
Reportedly inspired by a request from Ailey to Shirley Martin to develop 
choreography based on her experience with Horton's method, the dance is a 
free-flowing study in style. Solos and duets focus on groups of movements -- 
floor moves, balances, the so-called "primitive squat" -- as distinct motifs 
began to mirror and complement one another, like jazz musicians on a roll. 
</P>
<P>
While "A Suite for Alvin" was marred by a few obtuse vocalizations, the second 
half of the program was filled by a work nearly all chat and almost no dance: a 
wretchedly hokey dance-drama called "VISIONS . . . it never was" (1983, 
restaged 1990). 
</P>
<P>
This melodrama -- narrated by insipid dialogue fragments -- takes place in the 
warehouse abode of a crazy recluse (Martin) and her family of mannequins. 
</P>
<P>
It was hard to believe that it was the same Martin who choreographed "A Suite 
for Alvin." 
</P>
<P>
One hopes the newer creation (which is part of a total of eight hours of 
choreography yet to be performed) is a sign that Martin is heading back to what 
she does best: unadulterated dance in the Horton-Ailey tradition. JAN BRESLAUER

BURBANK SYMPHONY PREMIERES CONCERTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HETTMANSBERGER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Burbank Symphony played the role of the mouse that roared Saturday. 
Unfortunately, in presenting the world premiere of William H. Hill's Violin 
Concerto in the Hall of Liberty at Forest Lawn, the orchestra did not justify 
the collective effort. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did the work. Yes, the piece is highly accessible. Yes, soloist Tamsen 
Beseke Brenton did her part with consistently satisfying playing. But, at 42 
minutes, the concerto is way too long. 
</P>
<P>
Cast in a traditional three-movement form, it strongly evokes Hindemith with 
its alternation of duple and triple meters, and a harmonic scheme built on a 
quartal system rather than triadic chords. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the predominance of motivic material as opposed to full-blown melodies, 
Hill nevertheless is quite capable of writing soaring passages for the soloist 
-- and Brenton capably scaled these lyrical heights. 
</P>
<P>
A striking and dark-hued Adagio, sans violins, held one rapt, and the 
theme-and-variations finale had its moments. But just as in the first movement, 
the overriding impression is one of gesture without substance, and we are left 
wondering just what it was Hill wanted to say. Director Hansel Rayner's alert 
and unfussy conducting allowed what eloquence there was to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
After intermission it was more a matter of just keeping things from falling 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
Rimsky-Korsakov's "Scheherazade" may have been too ambitious a choice following 
a world premiere. In any case, the silver lining to this clouded reading 
consisted in the contributions of concertmaster Roman Volodarsky. A former 
member of the Bolshoi Orchestra, Volodarsky revealed in his solos a versatility 
of expressive inflections and tone color no less than technical surety.

JIMMY BUFFETT LEAPS AROUND THE BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jimmy Buffett has never been a model of musical consistency. Like much of his 
past work, his concert Saturday night at the Hollywood Bowl contrasted 
literate, well-crafted songs with cheap and easy party anthems. 
</P>
<P>
Moving in fits and starts from song to song, Buffett tossed out an array of 
material filled with eccentric images -- feeding frenzies among sharks, Gypsies 
on the loose, cheeseburgers in paradise and a last mango in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
He did his biggest hit, "Margaritaville," of course, but he also added the less 
well-known -- and more provocative -- "Changes in Latitudes, Changes in 
Attitudes," "Son of a Son of a Sailor" and "Off to See the Lizard." 
</P>
<P>
The near-capacity crowd loved everything, especially Buffett's anthems to booze 
and raunch. But the best moments came when his off-the-wall verbal wizardry 
moved away from crowd-pleasing shtick into the probingly interior stories and 
visions that are the most intriguing aspects of his music.DON HECKMAN

FOR THE LOVE OF 'NIGHTINGALE' -- A FEAR FOR ITS EXISTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN ALBERT LOEWENBERG, PRODUCING DIRECTOR OF L.A. THEATRE WORKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is 6 a.m. on Monday, June 18. I am drinking my morning coffee and reading 
the opening paragraphs of Sylvie Drake's review of our production of the 
American premiere of Timberlake Wertenbaker's "The Love of the Nightingale" at 
the L.A. Theatre Works space in the Edgemar complex in Santa Monica. It is 
becoming increasingly clear with each line that the critic and I have vastly 
different views on this one. 
</P>
<P>
Although Drake had kind words for the production and the performers, we parted 
company on the evaluation of the play itself. Fair enough. But what is so 
awesome is that with the best intentions in the world and by doing her job, the 
reviewer of a major paper can wreck the many weeks of work and the artistry of 
people whose dedication and keen intelligence I have watched, as producer, on a 
daily basis. The reviewer can obliterate the work, for what is theater without 
the audience? My heart sinks, knowing that without the blessing of The Times, 
even with all my producerly resources, I haven't a prayer of attracting the 
public to see this important, new production, worthy of a major company. 
</P>
<P>
I read hundreds of plays, listen to scores of ideas for plays. I know when a 
work sings off the page. When Timberlake handed me the final draft of 
"Nightingale" in 1988, written for the Royal Shakespeare Company, it sang to 
me. It dazzled me with its promise and the glory of its words. I knew it would 
reach the audience head and heart in equal measure -- ideas received with a 
visceral jolt. That is my measure for what I want to offer the audience. 
Timberlake unfolds her secrets like an origami, intricate and spare with a 
poetic beauty full of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
"The Love of the Nightingale," adapted from a Greek myth, is, as Drake 
acknowledged, "heady stuff" that "ranges freely through compelling issues of 
rape, conspiracy, censorship (symbolized here by inflicted physical silence), 
chauvinism, war, slavery and revenge." That is why I produced the play. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in the audience on opening night, I was thrilled by the author's 
extraordinary talent; her commitment to big ideas, filtered through masterful, 
witty and purposeful language, is a welcome relief from the television comedies 
and kitchen-sink dramas that dominate current U.S. theater. 
</P>
<P>
I was proud to have produced this feast for the audience, who, I noted, did not 
cough, sneeze or squirm (a good sign to the producer). To the contrary, as the 
play progressed -- a swift hour and 35 minutes straight through -- laughter 
gave way to gasps and murmurs. The audience seemed to lean forward, almost in 
unison, toward the actors, with rapt attention, transfixed by the power and 
horror and theatrical beauty of the events spilling forth in a mounting 
crescendo of pain, compassion, irony, love and tenderness. The ultimate reward 
for our labors is knowing that the audience confirms our vision. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Mark Schifter has given us a gorgeous, well-directed production, 
hauntingly scored by Thomas Pasatieri and beautifully sung by Marnie Mosiman. 
The fine actors in the large cast, including Robert Foxworth, Brenda Varda, 
Carolyn Seymour and Roger Smith, deftly weave us in their spell. 
</P>
<P>
I love "Nightingale," and I fear for its existence. This is written to 
encourage audiences to see the play and judge for themselves. Having produced 
in Los Angeles for 15 years, I am inordinately proud of this show, as I have 
been of "Greek," "Decadence," "The Shaper," "Latina," "Bouncers," "Wooman 
Lovely Wooman," among other controversial but substantive works I have invited 
the audience to see.

RESTAURATEURS GIVE A SECOND OPINION AND A THIRD, FOURTH

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A restaurant's reputation is all it has. You cannot buy a reputation. You 
cannot get a reputation by paying for advertising. We made our reputation years 
ago through long, hard work and excellent word-of-mouth. What I have done in 
Los Angeles represents 30 years of my work. I do not believe any one food 
critic can be an expert in all cuisines. Each is different. It takes years of 
research and education to become an expert in the food of one particular 
country. It is impossible for one food critic to adequately judge cuisine from 
Italy, France and China. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Reichl's criticism centered around price. All details involving a 
restaurant make a difference, and the details cost money -- the look, the 
flowers, the china, the silverware and the service, as well as the food. We try 
to provide the very best cuisine we can no matter how much it costs us, and to 
stay in business, we must pass our cost on to our patrons. Food is only a 
percentage of our costs. We spend close to $60,000 a year on flowers alone. 
Glasses cost us between $2 and $17 apiece, china up to $25 a plate. 
</P>
<P>
It is unfair to criticize the price of a dish unless you know exactly what is 
in it. Reichl praised our "extremely swell salad," but said that she "had yet 
to meet the salad that is worth $17." That salad is expensive because the 
white-truffle olive oil that dresses it costs $29 for eight ounces, or $120 a 
liter. No item is too expensive if you enjoy it and can afford it. 
</P>
<P>
Reichl also complained that we served lotte -- she called it "the poor man's 
lobster" -- and sliced it "so thinly" that the texture was nothing like 
lobster. Now lotte is lotte and lobster is lobster. The main question must be: 
Did she like the meal? She liked the lotte and she loved the sauce. Why is the 
cut of the lotte so important? 
</P>
<P>
One would also expect a food critic to know the difference between foods. She 
referred to "caramelized leeks." Those were not leeks. They were onions. 
</P>
<P>
She complained that the sorbet didn't have enough taste. The sorbet she had may 
not have been as tasty as other sorbets because it was made with organic fruit 
and without sugar, which makes it more delicate -- and more healthful. 
</P>
<P>
We emphasize health in everything we prepare. We are among the serious 
restaurant owners who feel a responsibility to serve food that is both good and 
healthful. Most of our patrons are aware of what we are trying to do, and they 
applaud our efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Our customers are passionate about their food. They come back again and again. 
Many have been with us for the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Once in a while, it is possible that someone may not have an ideal experience. 
But if you open a bottle of Lafite Rothschild and it is not too good, are you 
then going to conclude that Lafite Rothschild makes bad wine? 
</P>
<P>
In the end, every person who comes to any restaurant is a food critic. The 
people who eat in your restaurant judge you all the time. They are responsible 
for its success -- or failure. I believe the patrons who come to L'Orangerie, 
many of whom travel and dine in the very best restaurants around the world, are 
among the most critical in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
I feel the only way I could get a good review from Reichl would be to marry 
her. Fortunately, I am already married.

TODD RUNDGREN AND HIS FANS TAKE A BAD TRIP BACK TO THE '70S 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Todd Rundgren turned another year older Saturday. But then, for Rundgren, who 
has never left the 1970s, age must be relative. 
</P>
<P>
A collection of his worshipers gathered for the first of a four-night 
celebration at the Coach House on his birthday, greeting him with mylar 
balloons, flowers and drunken bellows of "Happy Birthday, Todd!" every three or 
so songs. (The engagement continues with shows tonight, Tuesday and Thursday.) 
</P>
<P>
And Rundgren, as master of ceremonies, threw a party that was part 
"progressive" and "mellow" rock revival, part soapbox philosophy and part 
theater-orchestra -- all with a healthy measure of pretension. 
</P>
<P>
For all the vast musical expanses Rundgren has covered through more than two 
decades and 27 (!) albums, his birthday party ultimately added up to little 
more than a flashback weekend. 
</P>
<P>
This was a performance chock-full of Worst-of-the-'70s trappings, save disco: 
</P>
<P>
A 12-piece mega-band. Ten-minute songs. Rock as Broadway theater. And lots of 
"jam sessions" (remember those?), indulgent guitar solos and endless stretches 
of mellow. 
</P>
<P>
For the sold-out crowd of stuck-in-1970-something partyers, this was utopia. 
</P>
<P>
But for anyone who was thankful that the Sex Pistols, Patti Smith and the 
Ramones dismantled the paradoxically labeled progressive-rock movement, this 
was the unbearable lightweight of Todd's being. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by a guitarist, bassist, two horn players, two keyboardists, two 
drummers and three backup singers, Rundgren through most of the two-hour-plus 
set sang and conducted the orchestra, baton in hand, wrapped in a kimono and an 
air of self-importance. 
</P>
<P>
He combined a sampling of crowd-pleasing standards, drawn mainly from his 1980s 
work, with a trilogy from his recent stage musical ("The Smell of Money," "If I 
Have to Be Alone" and "Love in Disguise") and plenty of new material from his 
upcoming "Sessions" project, to be recorded during a five-night stint next 
month at San Francisco's Palace of Fine Arts. 
</P>
<P>
That the result was so thoroughly reminiscent of a decade long past is evidence 
that while Rundgren has constantly stretched the boundaries of his own music, 
his reputed status as a pioneering rock experimentalist is negligible. 
</P>
<P>
Most problematic, however, is Rundgren's lack of lyrical depth. For example, a 
new song he unveiled Saturday as his solo acoustic attack on censorship offered 
nothing more imaginative than "(Expletive) you, Tipper Gore" or "I just wanna 
(expletive) you, Jesse Helms." 
</P>
<P>
But, an entire cult lives out there, residents of Todd Nation, many of whom 
bought their Utopia Times subscriptions and "I Witnessed Todd" bumper stickers 
on their way into the show. 
</P>
<P>
And for those disciples, Rundgren is a tireless performer who knows and loves 
his audience, and gives them what they want on a Saturday night -- as evidenced 
by the countless standing ovations and outbreaks of dancing in the danceless 
club. 
</P>
<P>
For them, the '70s live on. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Rundgren plays tonight at 9 at the Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, 
San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $25. Continues Tuesday and Thursday. Information: 
(714) 496-8930.

MATSURI TAIKO GROUP AT BARNSDALL PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY McQUILKIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As those with broad cultural tastes know, the Southland is regularly blessed 
with visits from performers hailing from every continent. But we sometimes 
forget that there exists a cornucopia of international artistic talent right 
here in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
To wrap up its Barnsdall Park series of "Music From Many Lands," the Aman Folk 
Ensemble on Friday presented Matsuri Taiko, a locally based group committed to 
maintaining the Japanese tradition of taiko drumming. (Taiko commonly refers to 
any of a number of cylindrical or barrel drums in various sizes.) Combining 
virtuosity, discipline and showmanship, the six members of the ensemble, joined 
by guest artists, gave an exciting introduction to the art, which includes 
performances of numerous rhythmic patterns that grow increasingly complex as 
rhythmic strata are laid one on top of another. 
</P>
<P>
And no matter how long the selection, how frequent the changes of pattern, or 
how complex the rhythm, the ensemble -- led by Tokyo native Etsuo Hongo -- 
remained astonishingly tight, and created a dramatic momentum that completely 
involved the listener. As drummers moved from one drum to another, they did so 
with precise, rhythmic and stylized motion; it was a performance not only of 
music but also of choreography. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the selections were traditional examples taken from the 
repertory of well-known taiko groups, the 3-year-old ensemble offered some 
original material, one selection of which combined contemporary and traditional 
rhythmic patterns and used, in addition to the taiko, a snare drum, timbales, 
suspended cymbal, cow bell and synthesizer. 
</P>
<P>
To provide further contrast (and give the drummers much-needed rest), 
shakuhachi (flute) player Masakazu Yoshizawa and shamisen (three-stringed lute) 
artist Tateo Takahashi played examples of traditional Japanese music during 
each half of the program. TERRY McQUILKIN

Stevie Nixes Superstardom: Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks says she could be 
a superstar if only she wanted to be. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose 15 years ago, if I'd have wanted to really go for it in the same way 
that, say, Madonna did, I could have done that," she told Us magazine. "And I 
could have been much more famous than I am now and much richer. But it never 
mattered to me that much about winning thousands of awards or having 100 No. 1 
singles. It has never mattered to me to be a sex symbol." GREG BRAXTON

</P>
<P>
Orion Pictures has approved a sequel to the 1988 baseball hit. "We intend to 
make a sequel to 'Bull Durham,' " producer Thom Mount told the Durham Morning 
Herald in North Carolina. Writer-director Ron Shelton is working on the 
screenplay, and original stars Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins 
have been approached about signing on. The sequel would feature the three 
central "Bull Durham" characters in the latter stages of their lives. GREG

Copycat 'Turtles' Look for Trouble: Children enthralled with the Teenage Mutant 
Ninja Turtles should be reminded that the swashbuckling exploits of the movie 
aren't meant to be played out in the streets, safety experts said.

At the Northampton, Mass., studios where the popular characters were created, a 
few calls have been received, mainly dealing with children who apparently went 
looking for their heroes in real-life drainage systems, said Cheryl Prindle, 
executive director of Mirage Studios. Since the sewer-dwelling comic-book 
heroes made a smash screen debut in April, there have been a few reports of 
injuries. "Basically, our feeling is that kids need to be able to discern what 
is real and what isn't," Prindle said.

FEDERAL OFFICIAL SEEKS DATES OF FOUR ARTISTS' SHOWS BACK TO '84; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: THE GENERAL ACCOUNTING OFFICE MAKES THE UNUSUAL REQUEST OF TWO NEW YORK 
FACILITIES. THE INVESTIGATOR SAYS SEN. JESSE HELMS ASKED FOR THE DATA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two avant-garde New York City arts organizations have been asked by a federal 
investigator -- who said he was acting at the request of Sen. Jesse Helms 
(R-N.C.) -- to provide information on appearance dates of four specific artists 
beginning in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual request was made by the U.S. General Accounting Office, the 
investigative arm of Congress, in telephone calls to the two arts organizations 
late last week. Officials of the arts groups confirmed the telephone contacts 
during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Involved are the Kitchen Center for Video, Music &amp; Dance and Franklin 
Furnace Archive Inc. Both organizations have received extensive NEA financial 
support and are widely viewed as important showcases for cutting-edge work. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate but related development, a federal judge is scheduled to begin 
hearing testimony this morning in a lawsuit brought by a New York artist 
against the Rev. Donald Wildmon and the American Family Assn., a right-wing 
group headed by Wildmon and based in Tupelo, Miss. The Wildmon organization has 
been instrumental in the ongoing controversy over alleged indecent and 
sacrilegious work funded by the NEA. 
</P>
<P>
The suit against Wildmon was filed by artist David Wojnarowicz, who contends 
that Wildmon violated copyrights to his work and defamed him by distributing 
unauthorized, severely cropped copies of 14 of his images. Both Wojnarowicz and 
Wildmon are expected to testify in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Helms demanded that the GAO launch an investigation of the 
endowment for its support of allegedly obscene work. In early June, the GAO 
delivered a preliminary report exonerating the NEA -- specifically finding the 
endowment technically had not funded a controversial appearance by performance 
artist Annie Sprinkle at the Kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
Helms branded the GAO finding a "whitewash" at the time. On June 8, The Times 
reported that, in an apparently related development, the NEA had imposed a 
unique grant restriction on the Kitchen under which the organization is 
required to notify the NEA general counsel's office in advance of every event 
it schedules. A GAO official, testifying before a House subcommittee, endorsed 
the restriction. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Martha Wilson, founder and director of Franklin Furnace, and 
Barbara Tsumagari, executive director of the Kitchen, confirmed that they had 
been called by a GAO investigator late last week. Wilson and Tsumagari said the 
investigator, whom they identified as Paul Britner, said Helms had asked for 
additional information on the two facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to contact the GAO and Helms during the weekend were unsuccessful. 
However, the Washington Post reported on Saturday that the GAO had confirmed 
that the contact had been made at Helms' request. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and Tsumagari said the GAO asked them to provide dates for appearances 
at both facilities, starting in 1984, of performance artists Karen Finley, 
Johanna Went, Frank Moore and Cheri Gaulke. Finley is already involved in the 
NEA controversy since she is one of 18 nominees for 1990 NEA solo performance 
fellowships. All 18 fellowships have been held up in a dispute over the content 
of work by Finley and four other nominees. 
</P>
<P>
Went and Gaulke are both based in Los Angeles and produce work with strong 
feminist elements. All four artists have performed widely and been extensively 
reviewed by critics across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson and Tsumagari said the GAO gave no reason for wanting the performance 
dates and did not explain why -- since Helms' original request for an 
investigation centered on NEA funding in 1990 -- performance dates beginning in 
1984 were relevant to the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
"My sense is that, whatever I say, it will be used against me," said Wilson, 
who said she asked the GAO for time to consult with her attorneys before 
responding. "Helms has probably already decided that these artists are obscene. 
This issue is, isn't this harassment?" 
</P>
<P>
Tsumagari noted that the dates the four artists performed at the Kitchen and 
Franklin Furnace could be easily reconstituted from newspaper back issues by 
searching advertisements and reviews. 
</P>
<P>
"My reaction is that . . . it is probably within the appropriate authority of 
the GAO for them to do this," said Tsumagari. "But the problem is Helms is 
using the GAO to do research for him to use in his attack on the endowment on 
the (Senate) floor." Any action by Helms will likely occur when a bill to renew 
the NEA comes up for a vote next month.

THE DARK BOB ATTEMPTS A CROSSOVER AT HIGHWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG WAGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps inside of every performance artist is a closet pop singer. The 
temptation to mix body gyrations, flamboyant costumes and raw vocal power 
becomes too strong for the extroverted performer who usually does all that 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
So, with his pencil-thin goatee, pointy Captain Kirk sideburns and balding 
jet-black hair, performance artist The Dark Bob attempted such a crossover 
Thursday night at Highways in Santa Monica. In "Tales From the Dark Bob," 
songs, manic monologues, action painting and a belly dancer combined into an 
evening that skidded around themes of absurdity often revealing a bitter core 
of political realities. 
</P>
<P>
On hand to accompany him was an ensemble known as The Dark Band -- Paul Brown 
on electric bass, Paul Castellanos on violin, James Hoskins on cello, Myrna 
Neuberg on percussion, plus a bearded oud-player named Rico and a belly dancer 
named Kadi. Playing arrangements that were created mostly by ear, the group 
blended rock styles a la Andy Warhol's Velvet Underground with a visceral Arab 
pop sound. 
</P>
<P>
The results proved as much a satire on concertizing as a concert itself. The 
Dark Bob's sophisticated wit and extended delivery carried the proceedings, 
essentially an odd, pan-cultural, stand-up comedy act. 
</P>
<P>
His talent as lyricist dominates less-developed skills. Songs such as "Everyone 
Knows" succeed mostly from use of rapid-fire sentences filled with 
philosophical bantering, recitations of current events, religious reflections 
and proclamations that love is the most profound of all experiences. 
</P>
<P>
Prerecorded, electronically processed monologues were inserted between musical 
numbers, as The Dark Bob lip-synced to them. Other highlights included extended 
bluesy soloing on the oud by Rico and a transcendental arrangement of the song 
"Heroes" by David Bowie and Brian Eno.

The Thousand Oaks City Council on Tuesday is expected to approve a $17,640 
agreement with three trash companies, which will begin collecting recyclable 
material from 3,000 residences July 16. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement will begin the first phase of Thousand Oaks' curbside recycling 
program, which has been in the planning stages since last year. 
</P>
<P>
Although houses in portions of central Thousand Oaks, Westlake Village and 
Newbury Park will be targeted first, the program will eventually be expanded 
citywide. 
</P>
<P>
Residents will be asked to place newspapers, glass bottles and jars, metal and 
aluminum cans and California redemption plastics in 32-gallon containers 
provided by the refuse companies. 
</P>
<P>
The city will pay the companies $1.47 per house to pick up the recyclables.

<P>
A Simi Valley meat market owner has been arrested on suspicion of setting off 
an emergency alarm after waiting for an hour for police to respond to a 
graffiti complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Dino Andrade, 29, is the first person to be arrested for violating the city's 
year-old law prohibiting intentional false alarms. 
</P>
<P>
Andrade was arrested last week and released. He faces a maximum of one year in 
jail and a $500 fine. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a call from an alarm company saying there's a robbery in progress, but 
Andrade had just called to test our response," Police Lt. Bob Robbins said. 
</P>
<P>
Andrade, owner of El Ranchito Meats in the 1600 block of Royal Avenue, said he 
pressed the alarm in frustration because police officers had not responded to a 
call he had made an hour before denouncing graffiti vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
Andrade said that he first called police after he noticed that his van had been 
smeared with graffiti and that a group of teen-agers carrying spray cans were 
gathered nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Andrade said he believes that he is innocent because he didn't know he was 
committing a misdemeanor. "I just have a button here that says 'emergency,' but 
what does the word emergency come down to?" 
</P>
<P>
Andrade vowed to fight the charges in court. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

2 VETERAN COUNCIL MEMBERS TO RETIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two longtime Camarillo City Council members who have a combined 20 years of 
government experience have announced they will retire. Councilman Thomas 
Martin, who served on the council from 1970 to 1974 and from 1982 to the 
present, and Councilwoman Sandi Bush, who has served since she was elected in 
1982, have announced they will not seek reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
Both members said they wanted to spend more time with their families. 
</P>
<P>
"They have both been excellent council people," said City Manager J. William 
Little, who was hired by the council in 1988 to pull the city out of a deep 
financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of that crisis, in which the city lost $25 million in public funds 
because of high-risk investments in 1987, the entire council received a crash 
course in financial management, Mayor Charlotte Craven said. 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow, we have got to make sure that knowledge is passed on to the new 
members," said Craven, who will seek a second term in November. "All of us feel 
that finance is the most important consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Little predicted that this year's hot campaign issue would be growth. 
</P>
<P>
Chris de Sales, an insurance company executive who publicly opposed a proposed 
development in eastern Camarillo, said he will support two potential candidates 
who plan to run on an anti-growth or slow-growth platform. De Sales declined to 
give names of the candidates. He said he would not run. 
</P>
<P>
Gregory Gose, a tax attorney serving on the Camarillo Planning Commission, said 
he is considering running. Gose and his law partner, Kevin Staker, became 
active in city issues during the financial crisis. They worked to help elect 
Councilman David Smith in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey Eisenburg, a retired executive for a defense contractor, is the only 
declared candidate so far, city officials said. He unsuccessfully ran for one 
of two open seats on the council in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The first day to file candidacy papers is July 16. Filing closes Aug. 10, 
except in cases when an incumbent is not running for reelection. In that case, 
the deadline will be extended to Aug. 15. JOANNA M. MILLER

MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC LOCATION SELECTED

<TEXT>
<P>
An Oxnard location for a branch office of the Ventura County Mental Health 
Department has been found, and the County Board of Supervisors is expected to 
sign the lease Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The site -- a vacant J.C. Penney store at 555 S. A St. -- will house 10 health 
care specialists, who will take care of the medical and counseling needs of 
about 75 clients. 
</P>
<P>
The Oxnard team is part of the county's Small Community Outreach Treatment and 
Support (SCOTS) program, funded by a $16-million state grant for development of 
a prototype for mental health care systems in the state. 
</P>
<P>
"We chose this site because it was close to the Oxnard Transportation Center," 
said Ray Holzer, who found the property for the county. "Most of the people who 
use this system take a bus, and the transportation center is practically across 
the street." 
</P>
<P>
Once the lease is signed, $80,000 worth of renovations and construction will be 
needed before the team can begin providing service. Holzer said it should be 
ready to open by late August. KAREN McKEAN

Marlon Brando's daughter Cheyenne has left the country and will refuse to 
return to testify against her brother Christian, a prosecutor said today. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Barshop told a judge he will attempt to use the recently enacted 
Proposition 115 to introduce Cheyenne Brando's statements to police as evidence 
in a preliminary hearing for the brother, who is charged with murdering 
Cheyenne's boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Judge Rosemary Shumsky set Brando's preliminary hearing for 
July 23 but did not rule on the Proposition 115 issue because the matter is 
being transferred to another judge. 
</P>
<P>
Under the initiative, approved June 5, prosecutors may present hearsay evidence 
at the hearing in which a judge determines whether there is sufficient evidence 
to hold a defendant for trial. 
</P>
<P>
Barshop said Cheyenne Brando, who is eight months pregnant with the child of 
her dead boyfriend, Dag Drollet, has gone to Tahiti and refuses to return.

"We'll do this as long as it takes," said organizer Bijan Kian. "We will be 
back here again next Sunday. I have been in contact with a group that raised 
$150,000 (Saturday) by telephoning from home to home. This is from their 
friends and relatives. I'm sure we can double and triple that." 
</P>
<P>
The 50 organizers Sunday wore black armbands expressing their grief for those 
killed, injured and left homeless in what they described as that country's 
worst earthquake of the century. 
</P>
<P>
In Iran, rescue efforts were hampered Sunday as the strongest aftershock yet 
jarred the already severely damaged rice-growing region of Rasht, 120 miles 
northwest of Tehran. The new shock, with a magnitude of 5.7, toppled the few 
still-standing structures and caused mudslides that temporarily closed the road 
linking Rasht with other destruction zones in Zanjan province. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the number killed in the devastating quake reached 50,000, with an 
additional 200,000 injured. 
</P>
<P>
Army mountaineers climbed rugged mountains Sunday in an effort to rescue 
villagers trapped in remote hamlets in the ravaged northern provinces. 
</P>
<P>
"They have no water or electricity," said Farrokh Shokooh, another organizer of 
the Sunday fund-raiser. "Everything is made that much more difficult because it 
is the rainy season." 
</P>
<P>
Shokooh said the effort to help the earthquake victims was put together hastily 
Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The group set up the collection point in front of William R. Mason Regional 
Park on property belonging to the City of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Police Sgt. Tom Hume, who is in charge of policing special events held 
in the city, said the group failed to obtain a permit from the city. But police 
accommodated the group, blocking off a bike lane on University Avenue so cars 
could pull in and unload supplies for the earthquake victims. The supplies were 
put into a large truck parked along the road. 
</P>
<P>
Hume said that two officers assigned to the event reported the crowd as small. 
</P>
<P>
Organizer Genia Panahi, 40, of Newport Beach, said the 150 Iranian doctors 
practicing in Orange County responded to calls for medicine, surgical gloves, 
disposable needles and blood bags. Organizers said between 60,000 and 80,000 
Iranians live in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"Medicine is in such a short supply over there," said Panahi, who along with 
her husband is a medical doctor. "Doctors are being asked to donate needles, 
gloves and antibiotics." 
</P>
<P>
Her 17-year-old son, Homan, and his friend Sepehr Khonsari worked throughout 
the day Saturday collecting medical supplies from doctors' offices throughout 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
The group -- the Orange County Committee for Iran Earthquake Relief -- has set 
up a special account at Capital Bank in Santa Ana. Checks can be made out to 
the Iran Earthquake Fund and mailed to the bank at 400 N. Tustin Ave. Blankets, 
tents and sleeping bags can be delivered to the Iranian Cultural Center at 8361 
Westminster Blvd., Suite 220, in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Kian said money sent to the special Capital Bank account will be turned over to 
the Red Cross for distribution in Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Red Cross representative Sylvia Stewart said the Red Cross will accept only 
monetary contributions because shipping supplies there is very expensive. She 
said sending money and allowing the supplies to be purchased there "helps 
stimulate the economy." She said the donations are sent to the national Red 
Cross and then to the international organization. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Student Assn. at California State Fullerton has set up a booth in 
Parking Lot C near State College Boulevard and Nutwood Avenue. The donations 
will be forwarded to the Red Cross or they may be sent directly to the Red 
Cross, P.O. Box 11364, Santa Ana, CA. 92711-1364.

ORANGE COUNTY SUMMER; 
</P>
<P>
RESIDENTS FINDING FUN IN THE SUN RIGHT NEAR THEIR OWN BACK YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
They swarm over the tide pools like grasshoppers dipped in neon green, yellow 
and pink. They trail through museums in Bermuda shorts, with visors and 
cameras. They drop their trash nearly everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
They look and act like tourists. But many of the 39.4 million tourists in 
Orange County are, in fact, us. 
</P>
<P>
"More people who live here are taking vacations within the county," said Stuart 
Zanville, director of public relations at Knott's Berry Farm where more than 
half the visitors are local. "Year-round schools are one reason. More 
youngsters are taking part in organized summer activities that keep families in 
the area. Air fares are expensive. People need more little breaks." 
</P>
<P>
Whether hosting out of town guests or simply exploring their own back yard, 
local families are rediscovering Orange County like a foreign country. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Gharibjanians of Irvine has lived in the county for nine years but this 
summer paid $14.95 for Frommer's California With Kids to read the travel advice 
for Orange County. "We've been to Sea World and Disneyland. All the touristic 
places." Gharibjanians said she is looking for some alternatives to lying by 
the pool or lake in her Irvine neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with such travel guides, schedules and reservations, families are finding 
lesser known and less expensive family attractions as well as fresh approaches 
to enjoying Disneyland, Knott's and the museums, without crowds or tears. 
</P>
<P>
For the second summer in a row, Santa Ana teacher Evy Disner has turned tour 
guide, organizing in- and out-of-town relatives and their children into what 
she calls "cousins' camp." The schedule -- including Disneyland, Knott's, the 
Santa Ana Zoo and Mission San Juan Capistrano -- is full, but flexible. 
</P>
<P>
"They have to be short trips and in the morning, so they can take naps in the 
afternoon," said Disner, in sunglasses and a fanny pack as she pointed out a 
statue of Father Junipero Serra at the mission to several siblings and in-laws, 
two grandparents and nine children, ranging in age from 1 1/2 to 9. 
</P>
<P>
Special days for children are held the last Saturday of the month from 10 a.m. 
to 1 p.m. at the mission. They are told about early mission life through skits 
and crafts such as making adobe bricks, headbands and playing Indian games. 
</P>
<P>
A favorite of the "cousins' camp" is the La Habra Children's Museum. "They can 
dress up in weird, old-fashioned clothes," Disner said. Friday, they toured the 
Museum of Natural History and Science in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
To attract locals, Knott's Berry Farm has instituted a summer discount from $21 
to $12 after 6 p.m. "We tested it last summer as a teen price and found a lot 
of families asked if they could take advantage of it too. Dad may be working, 
but he can get off early and can come to the park for dinner and a couple, 
three hours of entertainment," said Stuart Zanville, public relations director. 
</P>
<P>
Lines should be shorter this year, he said. Tourists from outside Southern 
California are expected to be fewer this summer because of publicity in recent 
months about malathion spraying, earthquakes and violence in general, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For those unable to resist the "granddaddy of all the theme parks," Frommer's 
suggests visiting Disneyland on Fridays and Sundays -- the lightest days during 
the summer for the park. The writers suggest purchasing tickets in advance and 
arriving at the 8 a.m. opening time. When it gets crowded, some people get 
their hands stamped, leave the park and return at dinner time when lines are 
shorter. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the biggest Disneyland mistake parents make is taking children under 1 
year old to the park, said Dr. Stephen Koffler, public relations director of 
the American Academy of Pediatrics and a pediatrician at Hoag Health Center in 
Irvine and Newport Beach. "Why spend the money? The children don't know 
anything. They get scared. They can't go on rides, and if they do, they get 
sick." 
</P>
<P>
As a father, Koffler said he didn't heed his own advice and now has a photo of 
his 1-year-old daughter screaming because Mickey Mouse spoke to her. Now, he 
said, "I won't take my grandchildren until they're 3 or 4." 
</P>
<P>
Koffler prefers that parents show children "real things they can relate to" in 
the great outdoors, found by following the freeways and highways to local 
camping spots -- at Newport Dunes and Aquatic Park or Doheny or San Clemente 
state beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Frommer's, one of the bigger names in travel guides, calls the Corona del Mar 
State Beach, possibly "the best beach in the area for families." 
</P>
<P>
At its southern edge, at the corner of Ocean Boulevard and Poppy, are the 
scenic tide pools. 
</P>
<P>
No teen-agers with boom boxes here. No surf Nazis. In fact there are barely any 
waves. The only bikinis are worn by pregnant women with toddlers hanging on 
their knees. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular attractions are Hector Guajardo and Jerry Aguiar, two marine 
conservationists who skin dive around the rocks every morning, plucking sea 
creatures to place in a bucket for the children to see and touch. 
</P>
<P>
This morning, the bucket holds a brittle sea star, a giant sea urchin, a 
keyhole limpet and a giant sea slug that, Aguiar tells squealing girls, feels 
like "3-week-old Jell-O." A suspicious 7-year-old whose carrot freckles match 
her hair calls it "slimy, weird and funny." 
</P>
<P>
They also conduct free tours of the tide pools. Reservations for groups can be 
made by calling (714) 644-3047. 
</P>
<P>
Better known by out of town tourists than locals is the Doll and Toy Museum, 
1238 S. Beach Blvd. in Anaheim, located in Hobby City -- a unique six-acre 
island of shops resembling a combination Santa's Village/Lake Wobegon with 
train rides and picnic areas. 
</P>
<P>
The museum, built to resemble the White House, houses an eclectic collection of 
hundreds of antique dolls. Admission is $1 for adults, 50 cents for seniors and 
children under 12. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh look!" cried Jessica Melicia, 5, from San Jose. "It's Jesus!" Seconds 
later: "Oh, lookit! Mr. T.!" Then, the highlight for parents and children 
alike: "Oh, look! Barbie!" 
</P>
<P>
In floor to ceiling cases, stand hundreds of Kens and Barbies representing a 
visual history of the dolls' past 30 years. There is the voluptuous Barbie in a 
pillbox hat and bouffant hairdo, Barbie as a Mouseketeer, Barbie in horn-rimmed 
glasses. And her main accessory, Ken, in military and football uniforms, 
striped pajamas and as a barbecue chef. "Oh look! What are those? Bell 
bottoms?" 
</P>
<P>
Run by Bea DeArmond, 77, who sees herself as Mother Goose, Hobby City includes 
a Cabbage Patch Kids "adoption center" where "doctors and nurses" sell dolls 
and accessories and issue prescriptions on the care and feeding of old dolls. 
</P>
<P>
"If they come in dirty, they say, 'What kind of a mother are you?' " DeArmond 
said. 
</P>
<P>
A small open-air train that carries small children runs through the shops. 
Picnic tables are available. 
</P>
<P>
In most museums, "museum fatigue" usually sets in at an hour and a half for 
adults, said Maxine Gaiber, public relations officer at the Newport Harbor Art 
Museum. Children's interest may vary, depending on the size and type of 
exhibit. "Sometimes in a science museum with buttons to push and things to do, 
they may last longer." Parents should let children set their own pace, allowing 
time for breaks in the cafeteria and shop, she said. 
</P>
<P>
To help children enjoy museums, some travel mavens suggest starting with the 
souvenir shop at the beginning of the visit, rather than the end. They might 
purchase postcards of the exhibits and then hunt for the originals. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Harbor Art Museum offers a children's guide and scavenger hunt for 
each show, available on request at the desk. Sample: "Sometimes Andy Warhol's 
mother would handwrite on his drawings. Find a work that has handwriting on it, 
write the words you see on the painting in the space below." 
</P>
<P>
Hidden words in the Word Search Puzzles might be: "commercial art," "strawberry 
Jell-O," or "Zsa Zsa Gabor." 
</P>
<P>
More affluent families are taking short trips to hotels such as the Four 
Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach that offer ultraluxurious "escape weekend" 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents are traveling more and more with their children," said Linda Barragan, 
director of public relations. Parents who might spend a day or two at their 
hotel when traveling alone now stay two or three nights with their children as 
a result of extravagant programs that resemble summer camps, complete with 
activity directors, she said. Most guests are from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
While parents golf or shop, the directors will take youngsters to the library 
or fire station, and to the hotel kitchen to make cookies with the chef. While 
parents sip champagne at brunch, children have their own $22 brunch, of hot 
dogs, pizza and sundaes. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter how luxurious the accommodations, any hotel room can be scary to 
children, Koffler warned. So don't forget your child's security blanket.

CITY STAFF TO RECYCLE USED OFFICE PAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city will soon launch a recycling program to help all municipal employees 
be environmentally responsible without having to leave their desks. 
</P>
<P>
The program, which the City Council approved and which will begin operating 
next month, will provide each employee with a desktop recycling bin. All city 
government departments -- including the libraries and the police and fire 
departments -- will participate. 
</P>
<P>
Although the waste management plan began in January as a pilot program, 
officials hope that its full implementation will become a model for companies 
to follow. A training videotape will be made available to any company 
interested in starting a recycling plan, said Philip Pierce, street division 
manager for the Department of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout City Hall, each desk will be equipped with a 10-inch high bin 
divided into two sections, one for white paper and one for colored and mixed 
paper products. Employees are being asked to dump their memos, typing and 
computer paper into the box. When it fills up, they are supposed to transfer 
the waste to a larger bin in their office. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had nothing but a great response from management level all the way 
through the rank and file," Pierce said. "If you make it easy, they'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
Three departments participating in the pilot program recycled nearly 6,500 
pounds of mixed paper in six months, and sold it to Paper Scrap Specialists for 
$300, Pierce said. The city is currently negotiating with vendors to sell its 
waste under the new program. More than 90% of office paper is considered high 
quality and recyclable, and the program should become self-supporting, Pierce 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The program was first discussed three years ago, long before last year's state 
mandate requiring public agencies to reduce their solid waste 25% by 1995, 
Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
It comes at a time when other cities are also exploring recycling plans. Irvine 
launched a program earlier this year, and Costa Mesa has implemented an trial 
program at City Hall. Pierce predicted that other cities will soon follow. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people get surprised when they find out how much trash is generated," 
he said. "I think we had the decade of the hippies and the decade of 
this-and-that, and the '90s should be the decade of solid waste. We really have 
to do something about it." MARY HELEN BERG

CITY COUNCIL TO HEAR APPEAL ON RIDGELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fate of the city's last undeveloped ridgeline may be decided at tonight's 
City Council meeting, when the council hears an appeal brought by one of its 
own members. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission approved the controversial plan to build 719 homes on 
Naciente Ridge last month, but an appeal was filed May 25 by Councilman William 
S. Craycraft, who said he was worried about a geological survey that indicated 
potential landslide areas on the 421-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think (filing the appeal) is any big deal," he said. "I just want to 
be certain there are no problems" with slope stability. 
</P>
<P>
The first public hearing on the proposed development in April drew 300 people, 
and officials say they expect heavy attendance at tonight's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The project is being proposed by the Mission Viejo Co., which has offered to 
build several athletic parks for the city's many youth sports organizations and 
to donate more than 200 acres of open space in return for the right to develop 
the ridgeline. Company officials estimate the value of the land gift and the 
parks at about $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
But homeowners living near the project site, which runs almost three miles 
parallel to Olympiad Road, say the trade-off is poor compensation for the loss 
of the city's last ridgeline. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission approved the development last month, saying that its 
benefits to the community outweigh the ecological impact. 
</P>
<P>
Debate over the project is also being clouded by an agreement reached between 
the Mission Viejo Co. and Councilman Robert A. Curtis. That proposal suggested 
that approvals for Naciente Ridge development and a large-scale 
hotel/commercial complex off Crown Valley Parkway be linked to several 
concessions from the developer. FRANK MESSINA

LANDMARK STATUS GIVEN CEMETERY

<TEXT>
<P>
Nestled on one of the oldest and quietest residential streets in Anaheim sits 
one of the city's most historic spots, the Anaheim Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
In the quaint park, with its neatly trimmed green grass and well-manicured 
shrubs, rest some of the founding families of the north county area. 
</P>
<P>
Many of their names now adorn the area's major streets and buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Native Daughters of the Golden West designated the county's 
oldest cemetery a historical landmark and raised a flagpole on the site for the 
honor. The 123-year-old cemetery is home to some veterans of the Civil War, and 
a number of the more than 10,000 plots date back to the mid-19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
"This is what the Native Daughters stand for as the state's oldest historical 
society," said Mickey Welle, incoming president of the group. "We feel the 
cemeteries should be marked because that's where your pioneers are." 
</P>
<P>
The group also donated California and U.S. flags to the Anaheim Cemetery in 
ceremonies last week that were attended by local officials and community 
members. They gathered under the sycamore and palm trees that dot the serene 
park, which spans 14 acres and is nearly a full city block deep. It still is 
used to lay the city's residents to rest. 
</P>
<P>
In the tiny office where cemetery manager Jack Fleming works, lead and 
stained-glass arched windows, left over from the original St. Boniface church 
in Anaheim, grace the walls. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming said the windows are from the Kraemer and Backs families, who were 
instrumental in the growth of the North County area. But he added that there 
are too many other important people at the cemetery to single out just a few 
well-known names. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to name too many names," Fleming said. "They're all important 
people." LISA MASCARO

IMPROVEMENT OF CITY BUILDINGS STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID F. BURKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Confronted with an aging set of city facilities, City Council members last week 
approved a study to examine the state of city buildings and determine whether 
voters should be asked to approve as much as $7 million in improvements. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Police Department is housed in a 26-year-old station house, and its 
community center operates out of a converted savings and loan building. 
</P>
<P>
The growing police force and its facility requirements have commanded top 
attention, but Councilman William D. Mahoney urged his colleagues to take an 
overall view. 
</P>
<P>
"If we just look at one facility, I think we're going to be making a mistake," 
he said. "I think we need to take an overall look at the whole downtown area." 
</P>
<P>
The council voted Tuesday to authorize a study of community needs as well as 
options for funding improvements. The discussion included the possibility of a 
special election asking voters to approve expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Lee Risner told the council the study should include a projection 
of the city's future population makeup. "If we're going to have a large percent 
of senior citizens, that will have an impact on recreational needs. It will 
also have an impact on the police department," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The study will also examine the possibility of a city beautification plan, an 
idea suggested by Councilman Douglas Bystry. Although some council members 
worried about the costs of such a plan, Bystry urged development of landscaped 
medians along major streets, entrance signs at the city limits, flower 
plantings and additional trees. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Beth Graham agreed, saying she has urged the council to take actions to 
beautify city streets since 1970. DAVID F. BURKE

City Council members voted last week to change the route of the city's annual 
Fiesta Days Parade and Street Faire, removing the event from Main Street and 
placing it on a stretch of Yorba Linda Boulevard running past the Nixon Library 
and Birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in response to a request by the Yorba Linda Service 
League, a volunteer group that has organized the parade for 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
Some city residents and representatives of the Main Street Merchants' Assn. 
protested the proposal, but the council backed it unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the merchants' association said they failed to come to a 
compromise with members of the league that would allow the parade to remain in 
the old town area of Main Street while still running past the library. 
</P>
<P>
"We never thought the parade should be just on Main Street," association member 
Leo Riley said. "But the Main Streets of America are disappearing. This is 
another nail in the coffin." 
</P>
<P>
Council member Henry W. Wedaa was sympathetic. "Personally, I think Main Street 
is the place for it to be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But we owe a debt to (the Yorba Linda Service League) for putting on this 
parade for some years," he added, noting that the league has faced problems 
holding the parade on Main Streeta and arguing that its request for relocating 
the event should be honored. 
</P>
<P>
Suzanne Miller, a representative of the service league, said her group 
requested the change because the old route requires closing Imperial Highway 
and does not pass by the library. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed to shift the parade route for this year to Yorba Linda 
Boulevard, where it will run between Casa Loma Avenue and Park Place. LINDA M.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 
</P>
<P>
LIDO OCEAN FETE EXTOLS CLEAN BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It was a bit of a spin on Earth Day. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists gave speeches and passed out literature as part of the Stop 
Toxic Ocean Pollution festival Sunday at Lido Marina Village. 
</P>
<P>
But the main focus was on fun in the sun, including bands, a fashion show, lots 
of seafood, a chowder cook-off and a sing-along, all to celebrate Orange 
County's clean beaches, as well as warn of environmental hazards. 
</P>
<P>
The event was a benefit for the Santa Monica-based American Oceans Campaign, 
but was organized by Newport Beach residents. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie LaPlant of Newport Beach, who came up with the idea for the celebration, 
was inspired by the successful cleanup of the American Trader oil spill off 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to celebrate the clean beaches and turn it into a positive situation," 
the 34-year-old LaPlant said. "I got all my friends and said, 'Come on, we're 
going to have a show.' " 
</P>
<P>
Speakers from groups including the Audubon Society and Save the Whales, along 
with "Cheers" star John Ratzenberger and Miss Universe Mona Grundt, addressed 
the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Lido restaurants, serving everything from shark to ice cream, donated 30% of 
their proceeds from the event to the American Oceans Campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Beach Rusty Pelican won the chowder cook-off for a New England clam 
chowder. "I really think we have the best chowder in Newport Beach," said Chuck 
Cummings, general manager of the restaurant. "If it sounds cocky, it is." 
</P>
<P>
Others used the occasion to display "environmentally conscious" wares. 
</P>
<P>
Among them was the "Cricket," an electronic system installed on the inside of a 
boat to prevent barnacles and other marine fauna and flora from attaching to 
the hull. With the device, boaters don't have to use toxic paint to ward off 
sea life, according to the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what paint it is, they all work on the basis of being toxic," said 
Stephen Rabbette, a representative of the manufacturing company. "You don't use 
the toxics at all -- you don't need them." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Hamilton, owner of the Cannery Restaurant, demonstrated the Hamilton Oil 
Remover, which he said can be used to mop up oil spills of up to 10,000 
gallons. The device has a rotating drum that sticks to oil, but not water. As 
the drum turns, oil is collected in a pan and vacuumed up into buckets. It can 
collects 450 gallons of oil per hour, Hamilton said. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said he hopes to develop the oil remover so it can be used in larger 
spills, such as that of the American Trader. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that the need is there," Hamilton said. "It was a big one, but it 
wasn't anything like Valdez or Texas, and we still couldn't control it." TED 
JOHNSON

JAMES CAN HIT, PROVING HE CAN FIELD, TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Joey James doesn't mind being noticed just because he can hit a baseball. In 
fact, he has become used to it since his days at Newport Harbor High School and 
Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
But now that he's playing professionally, James, a 6-foot, 220-pound 
left-handed hitter, would like people to know he can play some defense, too. 
</P>
<P>
James, 24, is the first baseman for the Clinton (Iowa) Giants, San Francisco's 
Class-A team in the Midwest League. In 67 games, he is hitting .283, with 11 
home runs and a league-leading 55 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
James is quick to point out that he has made a mere six errors, two in the 
first game. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm starting to feel a lot more comfortable at first," he said. "I'm getting 
used to being there. A lot of people don't realize I've never played that much 
first base before this year." 
</P>
<P>
James was an outfielder at Newport Harbor and OCC, where he was a two-time 
all-state player. He then signed with UCLA, where he was mostly used as the 
designated hitter his junior year. 
</P>
<P>
He was a 16th-round pick of the Cleveland Indians in 1988, but planned to stay 
at UCLA for his senior season. When it became clear he would remain the Bruins' 
designated hitter, he signed with the Indians in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
"It was time to get started in pro baseball," James said. "I realized if I was 
going to make it, I was going to be at first base. And I needed the opportunity 
to play it." 
</P>
<P>
But his professional career got off to a delayed start. He had signed so late 
in the season that he didn't play in 1988. The next spring, at the Indians' 
spring training camp at Tucson, he injured his left elbow in a collision at 
first base. 
</P>
<P>
James stayed an extra month in Tucson to heal and to learn more about playing 
first base. But the time seemed wasted when he arrived in Watertown, N.Y., and 
was made the designated hitter for the Indians' team in the Class-A New 
York-Penn League. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why they wanted me to learn a position that they weren't going to 
let me play," James said. He struggled with a .233 average and hit only seven 
home runs and drove in 31 runs in 59 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to keep bringing up the DH," James said. "But that made it tough 
for me. It made it hard to concentrate, just sitting for a half hour then 
getting up for five minutes, then sitting back down." 
</P>
<P>
James got a break in the off-season, when he was traded to the Giants' 
organization for outfielder Ken Gerhart. And though the Midwest League uses 
designated hitters, James was told from the start that he would be a first 
baseman. 
</P>
<P>
"It made things better just when they told me that I would have a position," 
James said. "I liked that. It meant I would be more involved in the flow of the 
game, and I knew that would make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
OCC alumni: James isn't the only former Orange Coast player doing well in the 
minors these days. Dave Staton is leading the California League in home runs 
with 16 and is third in RBIs with 52. 
</P>
<P>
Staton is the third baseman for the Riverside Red Wave, the Padres' entry in 
the league. Staton hit behind James at OCC in '86 and '87, keeping pitchers 
from intentionally walking James. 
</P>
<P>
Greg O'Halloran, who caught at OCC in 1988, is having a fine season at Dunedin, 
the Toronto Blue Jays' team in the Class-A Florida State League. O'Halloran, 
who played for the Canadian team in the 1988 Summer Olympics, is hitting .294 
with nine home runs and leads the league with 53 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: In the film "Bull Durham," catcher Crash Davis (Kevin Costner) 
supposedly set the minor league career home run record with 247. But, in 
reality, who holds the mark? 
</P>
<P>
Answer below. 
</P>
<P>
Finally: Bob Hamelin, the former Irvine High and Rancho Santiago College star, 
had been talked about as the next first baseman for the Kansas City Royals 
after making the jump from Class-A to triple-A ball in just two years. 
</P>
<P>
But this season at Omaha began as a struggle for Hamelin, who hit no better 
than .170 the first two months. 
</P>
<P>
But George Brett's heir apparent is 13 for 30 in his last 10 games to raise his 
average from .164 to .210. He also has hit two home runs and has eight RBIs 
over that span to raise his totals to five home runs and 19 RBIs in 60 games. 
</P>
<P>
Hamelin hit .308 with 16 home runs and 47 RBIs last summer at Memphis, the 
Royals' double-A team, despite playing only 68 games because of a sore back. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Hector Espino hit 484 home runs in the minors from 1960 to 1984. 
All but 31 of his homers came in the Mexican League. The Angels tried to sign 
him in the late 1960s, but a deal couldn't be worked out.

... AND FOR ALL ANGELENOS, AS WELL; 
</P>
<P>
WHY THE CITY COUNCIL SHOULD APPROVE BRADLEY'S MANDATORY CONSERVATION PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley today fires the toughest salvo yet in his campaign to make 
Angelenos more efficient consumers of water. 
</P>
<P>
Though the City Council members who will consider the mayor's proposal this 
week seem as ambivalent as Los Angeles consumers about the complex plan, the 
lawmakers do seem to be in general agreement that seemingly hard measures taken 
now will pay off many-fold in the months and years to come. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley proposes a mandatory 10%, across-the-board reduction in water 
consumption by residential and industrial customers alike. The proposal, if 
adopted, will make Los Angeles a national leader in public water conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, every municipal water customer must reduce consumption to 90% 
of the amount the household used in 1986. Violators first face warnings and, 
after subsequent abuses, stiff fines. In effect, customers flagged as wasteful 
will pay the true cost of the scarce resource. 
</P>
<P>
The plan incorporates opportunities for appeals and exempts 
already-conscientious consumers who had the foresight to conserve in or before 
1986. A Department of Water and Power office will analyze data on each home to 
determine whether a customer already is conserving. Another panel appointed by 
the City Council will review records of cases in which homeowners feel DWP 
issued an unfair finding. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, consumers using less than nine billing units of water -- a single 
adult with no yard, for example -- will automatically be exempt from the 
compulsory cutback. 
</P>
<P>
How landlords and tenants will share the burden of conservation in multifamily 
dwellings is a bone of contention. Mayor Bradley favors charging 75% of any 
needed fines to landlords and the remainder to tenants. Landlords, he reasons, 
should enforce cutbacks and install conservation devices. 
</P>
<P>
Mandatory is a fearsome buzzword in a society that values convenience 
practically above all. But water conservation is an issue in which the public 
welfare is at stake. The council should endorse the mayor's proposal and 
enthusiastically help keep the issue before the general public. 
</P>
<P>
Water cannot be considered an inexhaustible resource. Although rain may fall in 
torrents tomorrow, or next year, such factors as Mother Nature's fickle nature, 
Southern California's population growth and even how well the economy fares all 
conspire to soak up every drop of water in the state: None of it can prudently 
be called "extra."

<P>
Queen Elizabeth II began the first visit to Iceland by a British monarch today, 
underlining a new warmth between two countries at odds for decades over fishing 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "cod wars" of the late 1950s and 1970s followed Iceland's 
unilateral extension of exclusive fishing rights in four stages between 1952 
and 1975, in order to protect its main livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually Britain accepted Iceland's 200-mile fishing zone in return for 
certain fishing rights. 
</P>
<P>
Iceland's woman president, Vigdis Finnbogadottir, and members of the government 
greeted the queen at Keflavik Airport at the start of her two-day visit. 
</P>
<P>
She inspected ancient manuscripts of Icelandic Sagas, walked through central 
Reykjavik and toured the national gallery. The Queen and Prince Philip were 
later flying to Canada.

CHINA ALLOWS BEST-KNOWN DISSIDENTS TO LEAVE

<P>
China's best-known dissidents, physicists Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, 
left the country for Britain today after Communist authorities allowed them to 
end their yearlong refuge in the U.S. Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
The White House immediately hailed Beijing's move as a "humanitarian action" 
that will better U.S.-Chinese ties. 
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old astrophysicist and his wife had sought refuge in the embassy 
after the June 4, 1989, military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
The official New China News Agency said they were given permission to leave the 
country for medical reasons after showing "signs of repentance." 
</P>
<P>
It said the move was "in line with China's policy of leniency toward those who 
participated in the disturbances" of last June. 
</P>
<P>
Since late last year, China has announced the release of more than 800 people 
jailed for their participation in the democracy movement, but it is believed 
that thousands more remain in jail. 
</P>
<P>
The White House said Fang and Li were bound for Britain aboard a U.S. C-135 air 
transport and would arrive in London early Tuesday. Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater 
said Fang had accepted a job at Cambridge University. 
</P>
<P>
"This humanitarian action is a far-sighted, significant step that will improve 
the atmosphere for progress in our bilateral relations," he said in a 
statement, adding that President Bush was informed of the development late 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
He did not disclose when or how the agreement to allow the couple free passage 
had been reached. 
</P>
<P>
Fang has been China's most outspoken and eloquent proponent of democratic 
reform. He and Li were well known for their advocacy of democracy and human 
rights in China well before the seven-week pro-democracy movement jelled. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed in the military assault on central 
Beijing and thousands of activists were subsequently arrested. Fang and Li did 
not play an active role in the student-led protests, but after the crackdown 
the Communist government accused them of inciting the unrest. 
</P>
<P>
They took refuge in the U.S. Embassy in the days after the crackdown, and 
American diplomats refused to turn them over to Chinese authorities. Washington 
also imposed sanctions that cut shipments of military hardware and U.S.-Chinese 
relations deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
Their release appeared timed by the Chinese for maximum political results. The 
seven leading industrialized nations are to hold their annual meeting July 9-11 
in Houston, and policy toward China is to be a major subject. 
</P>
<P>
Congress is also debating Bush's decision last month to extend 
most-favored-nation trading status to China for another year. The Fang case has 
been cited by some members of Congress demanding revocation of the status.

JUSTICES GIVE STATE PRIORITY OVER PARENT IN LIFE SUPPORT CASE 
</P>

<P>
The Supreme Court, in its first ruling in a "right-to-die" case, said today 
states may bar the removal of life-sustaining treatment from comatose patients 
who have not made or cannot make their desires known. 
</P>
<P>
By a 5-4 vote, the justices blocked the parents of a permanently unconscious 
Missouri woman, Nancy Cruzan, from ordering the removal of tubes that provide 
her with food and water. 
</P>
<P>
The court said Cruzan's rights were not violated by allowing the state's 
interest in preserving life to outweigh her parents' wishes. 
</P>
<P>
But the court, indirectly supporting so-called "living will" laws, said the 
Constitution guarantees a competent person a right to refuse medical treatment. 
That issue was not presented squarely in the Cruzan case since she is 
incompetent to decide her future, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Kurtenbach, who has worked with the Cruzans as head of the Kansas City, 
Mo., office of the American Civil Liberties Union, commented: 
</P>
<P>
"When we looked at it realistically, and with the recent history of the court, 
this is not that surprising. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure the family is going to be extremely disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said Missouri may 
require "clear and convincing" proof that Cruzan wants to die before allowing 
the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment. Such evidence is lacking in 
Cruzan's case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The chief justice also said that "not all incompetent patients will have loved 
ones available to serve as surrogate decision makers. A state is entitled to 
guard against potential abuses in such situations." 
</P>
<P>
"In sum, we conclude that a state may apply a clear and convincing evidence 
standard in proceedings where a guardian seeks to discontinue nutrition and 
hydration of a person diagnosed to be in a persistent vegetative state," 
Rehnquist said. 
</P>
<P>
He was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin J. 
Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Dissenting were Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. 
Blackmun and John Paul Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan, in an opinion joined by Marshall and Blackmun, said, "Nancy Cruzan is 
entitled to choose to die with dignity." 
</P>
<P>
Missouri and the Supreme Court "have displaced Nancy's own assessment of the 
processes associated with dying," Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
"They have discarded evidence of her will, ignored her values, and deprived her 
of the right to a decision as closely approximating her own choice as humanly 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
But Brennan said he is heartened that the court tentatively concluded that in 
some cases a competent person must be allowed to choose death. 
</P>
<P>
State courts generally have permitted removal of life-sustaining treatment for 
patients like Cruzan.

For Joe Cruzan and his family, the legal fight to let their comatose daughter 
die is over. Now comes what could be years of waiting while she lies attached 
to a hospital feeding tube. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court barred the removal of her life-sustaining tube today in 
its first ruling in a "right-to-die" case. 
</P>
<P>
To the family, the facts were painfully simple: They wanted death to become a 
reality for 32-year-old Nancy, who has been in a persistent vegetative state 
since a January, 1983, car crash. She is being kept alive by a surgically 
implanted feeding tube at the Missouri Rehabilitation Center in Mt. Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors say she has no hope of recovery, but could remain alive for many years. 
</P>
<P>
A voice on the telephone answering machine at the home of Joe and Joyce Cruzan 
in Carterville, Mo., said the family will have no response to the high court's 
decision until they have had time to analyze the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Gov. John Ashcroft said he is grateful the court backed the 
state's position. He also said that "our thoughts and prayers remain with the 
Cruzan family." 
</P>
<P>
For Joe Cruzan, a sheet metal worker from Carterville, there's no doubt about 
what his daughter would have wanted. 
</P>
<P>
"She would say 'Pull the plug, stop it. I don't want to live like this. I have 
no dignity,' " Cruzan said in an interview last year. 
</P>
<P>
"If she had her way, she'd like to come back like she was. That's what I wish, 
but it's not going to happen."

The Japanese Finance Ministry is to issue guidelines to help local financial 
institutions stop attempts to launder illegal drug profits, ministry officials 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
The guidelines, which will take effect Oct. 1, will require banks and 
securities houses to be sure of the identity of depositors when they take new 
accounts or make cash transactions above a set amount, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be the first step in our fight against drug-money laundering," one 
official said of the move to curtail the conversion of illegally obtained funds 
into financial assets that appear legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry officials said Japan will report the guidelines to a seven-nation 
economic summit meeting in Houston on July 9-11, where drug money may be a 
major topic.

The first day of talks between the United States and Japan to try to remove 
trade barriers and narrow trade imbalances failed to produce agreement in any 
key area, officials from both sides said today. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the U.S. delegation told a news conference the talks had been 
"friendly and cooperative" but none of the five main areas discussed had been 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, anxious to reduce its huge trade deficit with Japan, is 
pressing Tokyo to clear away a variety of business practices it calls 
structural impediments to free trade. 
</P>
<P>
The present talks, due to wind up Tuesday, are aimed at producing a final 
report on the year-long Structural Impediments Initiative before the July 9-11 
economic summit of the world's major industrialized nations in Houston.

KOITO DISPUTES PICKENS' STOCK HOLDINGS

<P>
Koito Manufacturing Co. said today that tax returns indicate T. Boone Pickens 
Jr. is not the company's largest shareholder after all, and therefore does not 
deserve a seat on its board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens responded by releasing an amended return that he said proves Koito is 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Pickens that was released to the press, Koito said the Texas 
oilman had reported the total net assets of his investment firm, Boone Co., at 
the end of 1989 at slightly more than $1.93 million. 
</P>
<P>
But, it said, Boone Co. at that time held 39.4 million shares of Koito stock, 
"valued at $950 million at the prevailing exchange rates at year's end." 
</P>
<P>
The lower amount reported on the tax return "appears to reinforce our 
conclusions that Boone Co. is not the genuine owner of the Koito shares," said 
the letter, signed by Koito President Takao Matsuura. 
</P>
<P>
But in a statement soon after Koito released its letter, Pickens presented the 
amended return, which included roughly the amount Koito had brought into 
question. 
</P>
<P>
"If they think they found a smoking gun, it just blew up in their face," 
Pickens said in a statement. Pickens, who is in Japan to attend Koito's 
shareholder meeting on Thursday, claims a 26% share in the Tokyo-based company. 
</P>
<P>
The statement said the original tax report had inadvertently included only 
Boone Co.'s American assets. The amended report, it said, was filed on June 12, 
"long before Koito's accusation." 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very technical matter," said Kanji Ishizumi, Pickens' lawyer in Japan. 
"They are just picking up on technical details. These are very disturbing 
tactics." 
</P>
<P>
Koito spokesman Richard Wolff responded: "Why would (they) make a 
billion-dollar mistake?' 
</P>
<P>
Koito believes Pickens is acting as a front for Japanese investor Kitaro 
Watanabe, who has "on two occasions tried to greenmail Koito or its 
shareholders," Wolff said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenmail involves large purchases of a company's stock in an effort to force 
the company to buy it back at a premium.

BONN, PARIS BANKS KEY TO TRUMP RESCUE

<P>
A West German bank and a French bank hold the key to Donald Trump's hopes of 
raising a $65-million loan in the next two days and avoiding a default on a 
casino bond issue, a banking source said today. 
</P>
<P>
The developer has been meeting with a syndicate of banks in recent weeks in an 
effort to work out a complex restructuring and avert what could be a string of 
defaults in Trump's real estate and casino empire. 
</P>
<P>
Under a proposed plan, the banks would extend Trump money to make overdue 
payments on the bond issue and suspend some payments on his $2 billion in bank 
loans in exchange for equity in some of his properties. 
</P>
<P>
A $20-million bridge loan is being prepared to tide Trump over until the larger 
loan is approved, The New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, quoting unidentified bankers involved in the negotiations, said 
before the 30-day financing can be extended, an agreement on the bigger loan 
must be obtained from all the banks that have a stake in loans outstanding to 
the developer. 
</P>
<P>
The collateral on the bridge loan would be an array of Trump's personal 
property, including his interest in the Trump Tower retail complex, another New 
York condominium building, Trump Parc, residential condos he owns in both, his 
private airplane and some stores in Trump Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the broad loan agreement include stringent restrictions on Trump's 
personal and business finances, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions limit Trump's monthly charitable contributions to $100,000 and 
stipulate that his household and personal expenses not exceed $450,000 a month 
for the rest of this year, $375,000 a month in 1991 and $300,000 a month in 
1992, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Trump's main banks -- Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Bankers Trust and 
Manufacturers Hanover -- have agreed to the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
But Dresdner Bank AG and Societe Generale, which own parts of some Trump loans 
arranged by Chase, are balking at terms of the deal, a banker with knowledge of 
the talks said. 
</P>
<P>
"If they don't agree, there won't be any deal," said the source.

SWISS PROBE POSSIBLE INSIDER TRADING IN SUCHARD TAKEOVER

Swiss authorities today began a preliminary investigation to determine whether 
news of the $3.8-billion takeover of the Swiss chocolate and coffee group 
Jacobs Suchard by Philip Morris Cos. Inc. may have been leaked. 
</P>
<P>
Zurich Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Rudolf Unterrassner said "intensive clarification" is under way to see whether 
media reports hinting at possible insider trading of Jacobs Suchard shares can 
be corroborated. Insider trading became a criminal offense in Switzerland two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Unterrassner said the Zurich Stock Exchange has been asked to supply records 
allowing investigators to analyze the share price movements. Urs Bruegger, 
chief legal officer of the Zurich Exchange, said there were "certain unclear 
elements" but that there was no concrete evidence of a violation. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs Suchard had ordered an internal probe already on Friday after details of 
the deal were published in newspapers on the eve of its announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors of a possible takeover of Jacobs Suchard had been circulating for weeks. 
The Zurich financial newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft noted in its Saturday 
edition that the volume of trade in Jacobs Suchard shares quadrupled from May 
15 to May 18, well before the rumors were reported.

A mysterious stranger who leaves three roses and a bottle of cognac on Edgar 
Allan Poe's grave every year on the author's birthday has been captured on film 
for Life magazine. 
</P>
<P>
A New York photographer, armed with $17,000 worth of sophisticated equipment, 
took what apparently is the first photograph ever of the visitor to the West 
Baltimore grave. 
</P>
<P>
But the visitor's identity still is not known. 
</P>
<P>
The photo appears in Life magazine's July issue, due on newsstands today. 
</P>
<P>
Photographer Bill Ballenberg staked out the Westminster Burying Ground on Jan. 
19, Poe's 181st birthday, and snapped a fuzzy photo of a man in an overcoat 
crouched at the gravestone. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hours and hours of boredom punctuated by less than a minute of sheer 
panic," Ballenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Ballenberg had accompanied Life magazine writer Gary Smith to Baltimore to 
investigate the graveyard tradition, which dates at least to 1949 and doubtless 
has been carried out by more than one person. 
</P>
<P>
Smith initially wanted to uncover the visitor's identity. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith said he was persuaded by Poe House curator Jeff Jerome not to disturb 
the visitor. 
</P>
<P>
"It meant so much to him to not ruin the mystery. We decided to respect his 
wishes," said Smith, who suggested the story to Life after seeing coverage of 
past graveyard visits. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome said he agreed to let the Life team wait with him for the visitor this 
year, as long as they did not try to nab, identify or talk to the man. "That's 
none of our business," Jerome said. 
</P>
<P>
Poe, whose most widely read poems and stories include "The Raven" and "The Pit 
and the Pendulum," was found semiconscious on a Baltimore street Oct. 3, 1849, 
and died four days later.

The district attorney's office charged Unway L. Carter, 22, with three counts

copulation. 
</P>
<P>
Carter was to be arraigned later today in Los Angeles Municipal Court. He is 
charged with raping Kinison's girlfriend last Thursday in the comic's Hollywood 
Hills home. After the the alleged sexual assault, the victim picked up a 
.44-caliber revolver and fired four shots at her attacker, but missed. 
</P>
<P>
Kinison was home asleep during the incident, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, who is 6 feet, 5 inches tall and weighs 300 pounds, met Kinison the

Neither rain, nor sleet, nor snow, nor dark of night, nor Michael Jackson shall 
keep the U.S. Postal Service from its appointed rounds. 
</P>
<P>
That's what lawyer Thomas Wampold reasoned after trying to serve a summons and 
other court papers on Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Wampold filed a class-action suit that alleges Jackson was not sick, as he said 
he was, when he canceled three concerts in Tacoma, and that he therefore 
committed a breach of contract with 72,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
A telephone call seeking comment from Jackson's publicist, Lee Solters, in Los 
Angeles on Sunday was not immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also names Ticketmaster Corp., which withheld service fees from 
refunds on tickets sold to the canceled October and November, 1988, concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Wampold had no luck trying to reach Jackson's attorney in Los Angeles by 
telephone. So he decided to have a process server go to Jackson's residence. 
</P>
<P>
But process server Mark Hamilton was turned away repeatedly by guards at 
Jackson's Encino and Malibu homes. At Encino, Hamilton was first told that 
Jackson didn't live there, and then was told that he was out of town and 
wouldn't be back for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Wampold finally asked King County Judge Marsha Pechman for an order allowing 
him to give Jackson legal notice of the case by first-class and certified mail. 
The judge granted the request. 
</P>
<P>
Wampold figures guards may turn away process servers, but nothing stops the 
U.S. Postal Service.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: NIACIN IS AN UNPROVEN CURE FOR RECURRENT HEADACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GRAEDON, TERESA GRAEDON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question. My husband has had recurrent headaches for years with no doctor able 
to find a cause or cure. After he read that niacin could help some types of 
headaches, he started taking 50 mg daily. This has helped his headaches 
tremendously. 
</P>
<P>
I want him to check in with his doctor about this treatment program, but he 
feels that since niacin is an over-the-counter vitamin it cannot be harmful. 
Are there any side effects from taking niacin? 
</P>
<P>
Answer. We were unaware of niacin being helpful against headaches, so we 
checked Dr. Sheldon Hendler's excellent book, "The Doctors' Vitamin and Mineral 
Encyclopedia" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1990). There are other stories like your 
husband's, but no controlled studies proving that niacin works for headaches. 
We're glad your husband has found relief. 
</P>
<P>
Flushing and itching are the most common side effects of niacin, which can also 
cause stomach upset. Serious side effects, including peptic ulcer, visual 
disturbances, changes in blood sugar control and liver damage are rare but your 
husband should see his doctor for periodic monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
Q. You recently suggested rinsing a child's ears with one part vinegar to four 
parts water after swimming as a way to prevent swimmer's ear. That's wrong. For 
kids, it should be half vinegar, half alcohol. For adults, straight alcohol 
works better and causes no significant tissue damage. 
</P>
<P>
A. Ear, nose and throat specialists are not in agreement about the best home 
remedies for swimmer's ear. Some of the experts we have consulted believe that 
plain alcohol is less effective than vinegar and water, which makes the ear 
canal slightly acidic and inhospitable to bacterial growth. 
</P>
<P>
Other specialists think that alcohol works best, in part by drying out the ear 
to discourage germs that love warm, moist tissue.

Whether parents use over-the-counter alcohol-containing remedies like Dry/Ear, 
Ear-Dry or Swim Ear or make their own vinegar preparations, rinsing the ear 
after swimming is the best way to prevent swimmer's ear this summer.

LIZ SMITH: CHUTZPAH PAYS OFF: MANDELA'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY

THE PUBLISHING world is agog over the clever and efficient manner in which 
Little, Brown acted to snag the Nelson Mandela autobiography. Hardly was the 
South African revolutionary out of prison last February when editor-in-chief 
Bill Phillips was winging his way to Johannesburg in a real cloak-and-dagger 
maneuver. People who called Bill's office in Boston were told that even his 
staff had no idea where he was. 
</P>
<P>
Upon his return to South Africa, Mandela will fall to and really begin work on 
this book. There is, as yet, no title for this tome, but Little, Brown calls it 
"The Memoir." They hope to publish in 1992. 
</P>

BOY GEORGE just headlined a benefit in L.A. for a center that deals with the 
emotional problems of young drug addicts. Show biz in general seems to have 
slammed the door and forgotten the British star since his own headlines of 
arrest and drug addiction. But the fact is that it was Boy George who caused 
the California benefit to sell out. He also won raves from American critics. 
</P>
<P>
He sang live to prerecorded backing and sounded amazing. His new songs are his 
best to date. And he ended using the Hare Krishna Temple Choir for a backup. 
They are saying the young talent is now more spiritually attuned and his next 
album for Virgin Records will be titled "Jesus Loves You." 
</P>

ELIZABETH TAYLOR acted against doctor's orders and the wishes of her own four 
children when she insisted on appearing at the AIDS conference in San 
Francisco. Do the weekly tabloids, who had the star dead and buried, experience 
even a twinge of shame when they see this living legend emerge Phoenix-like 
from her illness and come out of the hospital? Naaaaa!

SUZY HAS written lots about record tycoon David Geffen's buying of the Jack and 
Ann Warner house and grounds in Beverly Hills. Here are a few additions to that 
news. Geffen considers his $47-million purchase to have been "a steal." You can 
subtract big bucks from the purchase price because David is selling the 
furniture and many of the contents at auction. He could make as much as $9 
million on same. 
</P>
<P>
Already Geffen sold to Warner Bros. the collection of Jack Warner's eight movie 
Oscars and all his leather-bound film scripts. Geffen earned $3 million from 
this sale alone. So take $12 million from $47 million and the buy is costing 
the golden boy $35 million. 
</P>
<P>
Geffen will keep the room in the house designed by the famous architect William 
Kent. This decor is so famous it once appeared on the front page of The New 
York Times.

A woman considered the best female jumper in water skiing history ended her 
38-tournament winning streak Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Deena Mapple, who holds the world record of 156 feet, was bothered by gusty 
conditions and jumped just 126 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The effort gave her third place in the Dallas Grand Prix of Waterskiing. 
</P>
<P>
Mapple, 30, of Orlando, Fla., had not lost a competition in nearly three years. 
</P>
<P>
Sherri Slone won with a jump of 131 feet and Camille Duvall finished second at 
129 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty disappointed," Mapple said. "I would have liked the streak to end 
with me jumping well and somebody jumping better than me. But I'm kind of 
relieved. For three years, I've been wondering if this is the one that I lose." 
</P>
<P>
Mapple's husband, Andy, won the men's slalom competition in Dallas on Sunday.

Cuban high jump world record holder Javier Sotomayor has returned home from 
competing in Europe to receive treatment for a sore heel bone, the official 
Communist Party newspaper Granma reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Granma said the 22-year-old athlete arrived back in Cuba on the weekend after a 
recurrence of the injury which had kept him out of competition for about eight 
months from September. 
</P>
<P>
He was declared fit in May and had started competing in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an injury to the heel bone of his left jumping foot, in the same area as 
the last one. We don't think it's very serious," Sotomayor's doctor, Eduardo 
Gomez de la Cruz, told Granma. 
</P>
<P>
The athlete was due to be treated at a Havana hospital. 
</P>
<P>
A disappointed Sotomayor said he hoped to be able to recover in time to take 
part in the Goodwill Games in Seattle in mid-July. "It all depends on the 
injury," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Guillermo de la Torre said Sotomayor's injury was caused by problems 
with his jumping shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor, who holds the world outdoor record of eight feet (2.44 meters), 
returned to competition May 12 when he won the Barrientos Memorial event in 
Havana.

Cincinnati Bengals defensive back Lewis Billups pleaded guilty today in court 
to three misdemeanor charges stemming from his January arrest for allegedly 
waving a handgun at two undercover Cincinnati police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Billups, 25, pleaded guilty in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court to improper 
transportation of a firearm and two counts of aggravated menacing, all 
first-degree misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Ralph Winkler released Billups on bond and scheduled sentencing for July 
31, the week when Bengals players are supposed to report to the team's 
preseason training camp in Wilmington, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Billups faces maximum penalties of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine on each 
of the three charges. In return for his guilty pleas today, Hamilton County 
prosecutors dropped a felony charge of carrying a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Billups was arrested Jan. 4 in suburban northern Kentucky after he allegedly 
pointed the gun at two undercover police officers in downtown Cincinnati. The 
officers testified that Billups drove off and they chased him across an Ohio 
River bridge into Kentucky at speeds of up to 85 m.p.h. before Ft. Wright, Ky., 
police stopped him. 
</P>
<P>
Billups was charged in Kentucky with a misdemeanor offense of carrying a 
concealed weapon. On Feb. 14, Kenton County District Judge William Schmaedecke 
agreed to allow Billups to perform 40 hours of community service work rather 
than stand trial on the charge.

GOLFER HALE IRWIN PROVES HE'S A STILL A CLASSIC AT 45

Once again, Hale Irwin put golf's youth movement on hold. 
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old Irwin became the oldest man to win the U.S. Open last week, and 
followed it up Sunday with a victory in the Buick Classic. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still some life left, still some fun left," Irwin said. "These are the 
days you look forward to. There aren't many of them. You treasure them when 
they arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"And at this stage of your career, you appreciate them more than any others." 
</P>
<P>
Irwin plans a whole lot of appreciating this week. He's taking the week off to 
spend time with his family. 
</P>
<P>
He said there is no secret to the success of older players. 
</P>
<P>
"Hard work, fitness, diet," said Irwin, a former defensive back at Colorado. "I 
think we're in better shape now than people this age used to be." 
</P>
<P>
In April, 50-year-old Jack Nicklaus and 47-year-old Ray Floyd both were in 
last-round contention in the Masters. Floyd took Britain's Nick Faldo into a 
playoff before losing. And on the Seniors Tour, 50-year-old Lee Trevino already 
has earned $508,633. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin says age is an asset in golf. 
</P>
<P>
"It's called experience," he said. "You have to learn yourself, know yourself 
and your game. It is not an instant thing. It only comes with time. You have to 
know how you hold up, how your game holds up in the heat of competition. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be running off to a swing guru or a sports psychologist every five 
minutes. It takes time to learn that." 
</P>
<P>
Paul Azinger, 30, runner-up in the Buick Classic, looks at Irwin and is 
thrilled he's able to make a career of golf. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at Hale and I'm so thankful I'm in golf," Azinger said. "In golf, I'm 
young. In another sport, in tennis or basketball or something where you have to 
be fast on your feet, I'd be over the hill and on the way out. In golf, I'm 
young. 
</P>
<P>
"Hale is a lesson for all us young guys. We look at him and we know that we can 
still be playing and winning 15 years from now."

IRELAND SURVIVES IN A SHOOT-OUT; 
</P>
<P>
ROMANIA TOPPLED AFTER 120 MINUTES OF SCORELESS ACTION

<P>
Ireland blazed to a 5-4 victory in a dramatic penalty shoot-out against Romania 
to reach the World Cup quarterfinals today after the game ended in a 0-0 tie 
despite 30 minutes of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The first penalty shoot-out of the tournament took the excitement to fever 
pitch after 120 minutes of scoreless action. The teams were tied at 4 in the 
shoot-out when Irish goalkeeper Pat Bonner saved Romania's fifth shot, by 
Daniel Timofte. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran David O'Leary then slotted home the fifth for Ireland to send his team 
through to a quarterfinal meeting with Italy or Uruguay in Rome on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Timofte, a 22-year-old extra-time substitute, hit the ball to the right of 
Bonner, who maintained his excellent World Cup form with a catlike dive. 
</P>
<P>
One nail-biting minute later, O'Leary, also a substitute in overtime, drove 
home a fierce shot to conclude another World Cup upset and send Ireland through 
to the last eight. 
</P>
<P>
It was a dream finish for the Irish, who were runners-up in Group F and had not 
been expected to make an impact in their first World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
O'Leary's penalty took Ireland's unbeaten run to 17 games and sparked an 
eruption of singing and dancing by thousands of Irish fans. Ireland's English 
coach, Jack Charlton, too nervous to watch the penalties, immediately walked to 
Romanian Coach Emerich Jenei to shake his hand. 
</P>
<P>
Charlton said the moment of victory was even better than when he played on 
England's 1966 World Cup champions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm delighted for the Irish people," he said. "There will be a party in this 
town like you've never seen before and there won't be a moment's trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he said to his players after the match, he replied: "I just said 
well done. You've done everybody proud." 
</P>
<P>
The game was a tough, physical contest with Ireland breaking up the Romanians' 
neat, skillful play with hard tackling and tireless running. Both sides had 
chances but wasted them with inaccurate finishing. 
</P>
<P>
Romania, runner-up in Group B behind Cameroon after beating the Soviet Union 
and tying with Argentina, dominated the first half-hour by getting a grip on 
midfield. 
</P>
<P>
Ioan Sabau made several surging runs from the halfway mark, and playmaker 
Gheorghe Hagi showed touches of his extravagant skills, but Bonner was seldom 
seriously threatened. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland fought back into the game after a poor start and began an aerial 
bombardment of Romania's penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish strategy was to capitalize on the height and strength of forwards 
Niall Quinn and Tony Cascarino, who replaced striker John Aldrige in the 22nd 
minute when he limped off immediately after being penalized for fouling Hagi. 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Kevin Sheedy almost scored when Cascarino headed down a crossing 
pass by midfielder Paul McGrath in the 44th minute, but Romanian goalkeeper 
Silviu Lung pushed the shot over the bar with an outstretched left foot. 
</P>
<P>
Quinn and Cascarino put headers over the bar after the interval and time and 
again fullback Chris Morris forced his way down Romania's left flank and sent 
over dangerous crosses that left Romania looking uncomfortable.

West Germany, which already has been critical of the officiating at the World 
Cup, believes that it has been wronged again. 
</P>
<P>
The Germans, 2-1 winners over the Netherlands on Sunday night to advance to the 
quarterfinals, lodged an official protest today with FIFA, the world soccer 
organizing body. 
</P>
<P>
They hope to have the automatic suspension of striker Rudy Voeller overturned. 
</P>
<P>
Team officials contend that videotapes of the match show Voeller's expulsion 
was unjustified and said FIFA should reinstate him for Sunday's quarterfinal 
against Czechoslovakia. Voeller received a red card, along with Dutch defender 
Frank Rijkaard, and that carries an automatic suspension for the next game. 
</P>
<P>
Voeller said today that Rijkaard spat on him twice and pulled his ear during 
action near the Dutch net. 
</P>
<P>
German officials said television tapes proved Voeller's claim. 
</P>
<P>
"We are aware that FIFA can seldom take decisions on the basis of tapes, but we 
are confident that Voeller's innocence is acknowledged, possibly on the basis 
of the report by the FIFA commissioner. We hope Voeller is not punished," team 
spokesman Wolfgang Niersbach said. 
</P>
<P>
"FIFA is looking into the matter," said Andreas Herren, spokesman for the 
federation. "We are now deciding on the procedure." 
</P>
<P>
Soccer rules stipulate that a referee's decisions are final. Rarely is evidence 
other than reports from the referee and the match observer taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
But FIFA is awaiting instructions from its General Secretariat before deciding 
what course to take.

WHAT DO YUPPIES, GANGS SHARE? A UCLA ANTHROPOLOGIST KNOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN HENDRIX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walter Goldschmidt lives worlds away from the violent streets of South-Central 
Los Angeles. He has a house and study in an idyllic setting high above Bel-Air 
-- trees and flowering bushes line the lane, goldfish and water lilies float in 
a brick-lined pool, a waterfall quietly trickles down a rocky hillside. Yet the 
professor emeritus of anthropology at UCLA finds himself in accord with the 
judgments that residents of South Central have been passing on "Operation 
Streetsweep," the recent nationwide roundup and arrest of scores of suspected 
gang members. 
</P>
<P>
"Those guys are right. It's not the way to tackle the problem," Goldschmidt 
says, adding that he was not against the arrests per se, but that they are 
ineffective in the long run. The actions of gang members are often antisocial, 
but the motivation behind them, he says, is the universal need for acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to create an environment to which boys, and to some extent girls, are 
drawn, where they can see positive opportunities, the possibility of being part 
of the mainstream culture that many of them want to be in." 
</P>
<P>
Goldschmidt says all people have the same need for recognition, validation and 
acceptance from their culture and subcultures. Getting it constitutes what he 
calls the "human career." As with gang members, so with yuppies on the career 
ladders of corporate America, so with faculty members aiming for tenure and 
departmental chairs, so with the Tlingit Indians of southeastern Alaska, giving 
away their worldly goods to rival clans in order to demonstrate the power and 
prestige of their tribe over others. 
</P>
<P>
"Every man and every woman in every human society is engaged in the pursuit of 
career," Goldschmidt says, and while the nature of the pursuit varies with each 
group, the basic drive is the same: "the need to validate oneself, the desire 
for acceptance and prestige." 
</P>
<P>
He does not mean career in a narrow sense -- the "human" career includes such 
activities as creation of a family, public conduct, even the making of one's 
living space -- all the things that "the people of his or her community think 
makes a good person." 
</P>
<P>
Goldschmidt calls this need for a positive response "affect hunger," and he 
traces it to both biological and cultural programming. Affect hunger can be 
seen in various species of animals as they groom each other in the forest and 
care for their offspring. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Goldschmidt's own human career as an anthropologist has been spent 
researching and developing that view of human nature. Recently he pulled his 
ideas together, using his own and others' field research, in a book titled "The 
Human Career: The Self in the Symbolic World," published by Basil Blackman. 
</P>
<P>
Now 77, Goldschmidt, who first joined the UCLA faculty in 1946 after receiving 
his doctorate from UC Berkeley and working for the Department of Agriculture, 
has made it his life's work to make anthropology more relevant to contemporary 
society and problems. 
</P>
<P>
He talks about his life's work -- which includes studies of the Sebai people in 
Uganda, Indian tribes in Northern California, and an agricultural community in 
California's Central Valley -- first in his living room filled with Chinese 
furniture and antiques, then in his study, a light-filled 
book-and-memorabilia-lined place overlooking the garden. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Streetsweep is not the first time he has thought about gangs. 
</P>
<P>
When Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates announced in 1988 that the department 
was declaring war on gangs, Goldschmidt predicted the violence would increase, 
the killings would go up. Which they did. That year, gang-related killings 
increased by 25% over 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"It served only to challenge them," he says. In "The Human Career" he writes of 
Gates' action and choice of the war metaphor, saying it "feeds directly into 
the central values of the gang, (machismo and loyalty) inevitably evoking a 
spirit of revenge." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the solution is obvious and expensive," Goldschmidt continues. "We 
have to offer real career opportunities to underclass youth. Getting them to 
play football and basketball against each other is not enough. We've got to 
make it clear at the ground level that there really are opportunities, and get 
these children being courted by the gangs. Get them to see the payoff may not 
be as fast but it's more certain and satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll be expensive, but not as expensive as what we're paying now. We are 
spending a lot of money on the problem. We're spending it on police; we're 
building jails like crazy rather than schools and teachers salaries. It's not a 
simple solution but it's the only one." Gangs are not the only element of 
society where the values of the group work negatively against the values, or 
welfare, of the larger society. Goldschmidt sees a similar dynamic in the 
Chernobyl and Challenger disasters. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a disaster, like a plane crash," he says, people always ask, 'Was 
it a human error, or was it a technological error?' But there's a third 
question: 'Was the error at the organizational level, the institutional level?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
That was the case with the Challenger and Chernobyl incidents, he says. In both 
the American and Soviet disasters, overzealous bureaucrats were working to make 
their boss, their company, their division, their politicians look good. 
</P>
<P>
"There were people performing responsible acts, acting with the best of 
motives, or motives viewed as best. And yet, (the disasters) proved such people 
could be just as destructive as those feathering their nests. The institutions 
were inadequate. They did not create a moral environment to meet the 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Whether gang members, bureaucrats or aborigines, he says, the task for society 
is the same: to provide institutions and rewards that harness selfish 
motivations so they can serve the common good. "That's what totemism is all 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Totems, objects that are emblems or symbols of a group and which frequently 
serve some sort of mystical function, are crucial to him -- and to us. Whether 
the flag, a monument, a sacred relic of the past, or individual status symbols 
-- the sports car, the Phi Beta key, the club membership, the regimental tie or 
the gang's colors -- they help define a person's status and achievement in a 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
In Goldschmidt's career there have been an abundance of such markers, some of 
them predictable: the chairmanship of UCLA's anthropology department, grants 
and fellowships from Fullbright, the Ford Foundation, the National Science 
Foundation, the National Institute of Mental Health, presidency of the American 
Anthropological Assn. and the American Ethnological Society. 
</P>
<P>
Twice his former students honored him with an old academic custom, presenting 
him with a limited edition of bound copies of essays they had written in his 
honor. In February, on the 30th anniversary of the founding of the African 
Studies Center at UCLA, which coincided with Goldschmidt's 77th birthday, the 
academic community honored him for his leading role in establishing the center 
by throwing him a "thousand moons" party. (Based on a lunar calendar, he was 
1,000 moons old.) Emeritus since 1983, he still teaches several classes for the 
department, "elementary Goldschmidt and a seminar." 
</P>
<P>
Closer to home, there is his family. Saying, "there's no fool like an old 
fool," Goldschmidt reaches for some photos "at the ready" on an end table and 
shows off his first grandchild, marveling at his pleasure in having people tell 
him she looks like him. 
</P>
<P>
He has two sons, Karl and Mark, both in Los Angeles. He married his wife, Gale, 
in 1937. They spent their honeymoon among the Hupa Indians in the Pacific 
Northwest, watching the White Deerskin Dance, and spent much of their life 
together working closely, collaborating in research but not writing, with Gale 
taking many of the photographs that illustrate his books. For the past few 
years she has been hospitalized with Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
Goldschmidt, who was born in 1913 to German immigrant parents in San Antonio, 
Tex., received his B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University of Texas, before 
going to Berkeley in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of his professional reputation is as an Africanist and derives 
from the work he did among the Sebai people in Uganda, his early research 
focused on Indian tribes in the Pacific Northwest, the Nomlaki and the Hupa. 
</P>
<P>
His doctoral research, studying the effects of industrialization on an 
agricultural community -- Wasco, Ca. -- led to his work with the Department of 
Agriculture, conducting a comparative study of two rural communities: one 
composed of traditional, small family farms; the other adapting to large-scale 
industrialized farming. 
</P>
<P>
All of that research may be eclectic, but it does not mean it is without a 
pattern, all of it sharpening and focusing the fundamental questions and 
hunches about why we are the way we are and how we got to be that way. And, 
Goldschmidt says, with a long list of books and publications along the way, it 
all led to "The Human Career." 
</P>
<P>
"I think anthropology has a lot to say about human nature," he says, going on 
to describe what he attempts in his latest book. "It's an effort to bring 
together ideas of our biological heritage as animals and what we've done with 
it through the process of creating a second world, a symbolic world. We live in 
two worlds at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
For the individual, he says, the process begins in infancy. There is a dynamic 
between biology and culture, he says, and what starts out as infantile 
programming becomes the process by which all human experience of things is 
transformed into the symbolic world. 
</P>
<P>
"The child is inducted into this world," he says, and, driven by affect hunger, 
endeavors to evoke a positive response from his environment. 
</P>
<P>
Goldschmidt has spent his academic life studying what makes man a social, 
morally responsible being, immersing himself in the symbols, rituals and 
beliefs that form societies and hold them together. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, he says, it was probably atheism that got him into anthropology. 
</P>
<P>
"I was raised an atheist with a high sense of morality, too much morality. 
That's what gave me the questions." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow or other, he says, human beings evolved into something more than a band 
of monkeys. The somehow has to do with the creation of symbols, shared values 
and beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to get people to feel the clan is important, and to feel strongly 
about each other. I've come to the conclusion . . . that the ability to 
believe, the suspension of disbelief, is an essential ingredient in the 
transition of the prehuman to the human. . . . To me, religion is all a great 
metaphor for the human capacity to have empathy for a fellow human being." 
</P>
<P>
Human nature is nothing if not fascinating, and, sounding as if, overall, he 
rather likes it, he says of his lifelong pursuit: "This was the genesis of it 
-- wanting to know how human beings got to be the crazy animals they are."

<P>
Most people don't think much about hotels until it's time to find a cheap place 
to stay in Tucson while visiting Aunt Tillie. But Jim Burba thinks about hotels 
all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 There's been a lot to think about. When Orange County's growth boom began in 
the 1970s and 1980s, the hotel chains and developers began to take notice of 
what had been, until then, pretty much a hotel backwater, with the exception of 
Anaheim and Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon everybody was building hotels around John Wayne Airport, the suburban 
county's new "downtown." By the late 1980s the inevitable happened: There were 
too many hotels. Occupancy rates fell and room rates stayed frozen as a 
politician's smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the hotel market should be improving. Few new hotels have been built 
around the airport in the last few years. But it hasn't improved. Instead, 
business travelers seem to be making a lot fewer trips lately than everyone had 
expected, possibly as a result of tough times in the defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
 So these are the times that try hoteliers' souls, and the times when people 
like Burba are often busiest. As senior principal in the Orange County office 
of accounting firm Pannell Kerr Forster, Burba advises the hotel industry on 
matters such as market conditions and whether a deal to acquire or build a 
hotel makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
 With seven people in the Irvine office, PKF -- as its employees call it -- 
says it's the biggest hotel consultant in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Burba, 35, has been with the firm off and on since graduating from UCLA in 
1978. He has been in the Orange County office for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 In this conversation with Times staff writer Michael Flagg, he talks about 
what's up in the local hotel market and what's ahead. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Q. What's behind this recent hotel construction boom and when did it start? 
</P>
<P>
A. It started in the early 1980s because in Orange County, as in many 
California markets, hotel occupancy rates and room rates were strong. There was 
a lot of money available from financial institutions to build and there were 
significant federal tax breaks available. And you had some very aggressive 
hotel chains looking to expand, all of which made it easy to bring a hotel deal 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How long did it go on? 
</P>
<P>
A. Through the mid-1980s in most markets and even a little beyond in some. A 
lot of the hotels that opened then were conceived in '80 or '81 and then had to 
go through the local planning commission, the financing process and 
construction, and didn't open until, say, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Q. All those circumstances have changed significantly, haven't they? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. For one thing, we had very strong inflation expectations in the early 
1980s. If you'll remember, that was the era of double-digit inflation. If you 
used a 10% or 12% inflation rate on a set of financial projections and you had 
a fixed-rate loan from a bank, all of a sudden your income and expenses start 
to go up and your loan doesn't. So you should have a lot of money available to 
service the debt and pay the owners. The inflation expectations in 1981, when a 
lot of the hotels in this market were conceived, were for about 8% compounded 
average annual inflation through the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Q. And it turned out to be . . . 
</P>
<P>
A. About 4% on average. So if somebody decided to build a hotel in 1981 and 
thought his average room rate would be $100 today, it's probably about $70. But 
that was everybody's best call 10 years ago. And a lot of real estate deals 
were done on that basis. 
</P>
<P>
Q. This was more than an Orange County phenomenon, wasn't it? 
</P>
<P>
A. Definitely. Although Orange County probably saw some more velocity in the 
number of rooms coming in, particularly in the John Wayne Airport area. That's 
because it was a booming suburb of Los Angeles and a lot of office space was 
coming here. 
</P>
<P>
Q. In light of tax reform, which made many real estate investments less 
attractive, and the lower rate of inflation, how good an investment are hotels 
these days? 
</P>
<P>
A. Hotels can be a good investment, depending on how much you owe, how much you 
invested and the type of market it's in. A lot of the existing ones, though, 
are not good investments because occupancy rates haven't come up to the level 
they need to be to make the owner a decent return. And new hotels are difficult 
too, partly because financing has all but dried up. Then there aren't a lot of 
markets that can absorb too many new hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is there more buying or building going on in Orange County these days? 
</P>
<P>
A. There's probably more buying going on these days. There were only eight or 
nine hotels built last year and there were probably more sales than that. 
That's probably typical for most markets around the country: There are, for 
instance, markets where no hotels are being built at all. We still have a few 
small all-suite hotels coming into our marketplace because there are still 
pockets where a deal makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Such as? 
</P>
<P>
A. Anaheim, perhaps; Irvine Spectrum (a large business park in Irvine at the 
San Diego and Santa Ana freeways), places where there's still some demand and 
not a lot of hotels. Certainly the coastal hotels can make sense. The airport 
area, though, is probably a few years away from being ready for more hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Who's buying hotels these days? 
</P>
<P>
A. The obvious answer, just based on what we read and hear, is foreign 
investors. There have certainly been a variety of transactions in Orange County 
involving the Japanese and other Asian investors. And some domestic investors 
have bought hotels. Probably the majority, though, have been foreign. And 
that's probably true of the rest of Southern California as well. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So the Japanese are buying not only the big splashy hotels like the Dana 
Point Resort but littler ones as well? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What was the market like before the 1980s construction boom, when the county 
was less of a power economically? 
</P>
<P>
A. The Disneyland market has been a decent-sized and fairly strong market for a 
long time. The airport market only had a handful of hotels back in the late 
1970s and they performed at high occupancy and high rates. It was a 
supply-demand imbalance in the other direction, a direction we're not much used 
to seeing today. And then that all changed. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Hotel customers have changed a lot too, haven't they, with far more business 
travelers now that the county has developed its own economic base? 
</P>
<P>
A. Well, you have to make a distinction among the markets. At John Wayne 
Airport, 55% of the business is commercial, 15% tourist and about 30% group 
meetings. In Anaheim, which is about the same size market, only about 5% of the 
business is commercial, 25% tourist, 35% tourist groups, 20% group meetings and 
15% conventions. Those are the two big markets in the county. They represent 
about 75% of all hotel rooms. Obviously the coastal hotels from Dana Point to 
Huntington Beach are almost all tourism and meetings. And the hotels in Buena 
Park and Fullerton off the Riverside Freeway are heavily commercial, much like 
John Wayne Airport. Those are the other two major clusters of hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Is that a strong mix of customers? 
</P>
<P>
A. The airport market is probably just a little more focused on group meetings 
than you'd expect in a commercial market. With about a third of their business 
from meetings, the hotels have had to go out and work real hard to fill rooms. 
They have been pulling meetings into this area from a wider area than usual. 
There aren't a lot of commercial hotel markets in Los Angeles, for instance, 
that have a third of their business in meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Will the expansion of flights and new terminal at John Wayne Airport boost 
business much, as the hoteliers hope so fervently? 
</P>
<P>
A. The expected traffic is supposed to go from 4.5 million passengers to 8.5 
million over a period of time, so it should help quite a bit. The second thing 
airport expansion hopefully will do -- and this is a critical issue for the 
hotel industry -- is make John Wayne Airport less expensive to fly into, 
because it is very expensive now. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How much does that hurt the hotel business? 
</P>
<P>
A. A lot. If you're a group meeting planner and you're moving 30 people into 
this market, you may negotiate real hard to get good rates on a hotel, on your 
banquet and other functions, and whatever tourist attractions you're putting in 
the package. And then you look at your airline prices and find they're 50% 
higher than Los Angeles. That may well cause you to not come here. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Speaking of getting people in here, how far are the hotels willing to go and 
what's it costing them? 
</P>
<P>
A. They're being very competitive in room rates. It's evidenced by the fact 
that room rates in the airport area have not kept pace with inflation over the 
last five or six years. Getting customers into a hotel here can often come at 
the sacrifice of price. 
</P>
<P>
Q. The industry has developed all these different types of hotels in the last 
few years, like the all-suites hotels. Does the local market represent most of 
these types, or is it different from the average? 
</P>
<P>
A. Orange County is one of the nation's leading markets -- probably the 
second-largest in terms of its percentage of total rooms -- in all-suite 
hotels. The only market in the world that has more is Phoenix, because that's 
where Embassy Suites first started. Something like 11% of our market is 
all-suite hotels. The national average is probably 3.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why so high? 
</P>
<P>
A. A couple of reasons. The market here took off and grew at a time when 
all-suites were becoming a hot concept. And Bob Warmington, the Orange County 
home builder, also conceived of an idea which eventually became the Quality 
Suites and Comfort Suites concept, and there were several hotels built here in 
the mid-1980s as prototypes. It got a lot of people interested in this as a 
market for all-suite hotels. The vast majority of hotels that have opened in 
Orange County in the last four years have been all-suite. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How have they done? I seem to recall reading that they've generally not done 
very well nationally. 
</P>
<P>
A. That's not true. In Orange County, all-suite hotels have basically 
paralleled the other hotels. Last year all-suite hotels were at 69% occupancy 
while all the hotels in the county averaged 68%. Average room rates were $4 to 
$5 stronger than the county average, $77 for all-suite versus $72 a night. So 
there's an advantage to being an all-suite hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What about the national market? 
</P>
<P>
A. Nationwide the numbers are even better than here, but that's because Orange 
County has such a large number of all-suite hotels competing against each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
Q. So we can expect to see more of them? 
</P>
<P>
A. It's less than a 10-year-old trend, so will it be with us in the 21st 
Century? Probably. Will it continue to grow at the same geometric speed? I 
would guess not. But it's still the lion's share of new hotels in Southern 
California these days. 
</P>
<P>
Q. In general, how strong is the Orange County hotel market compared to the 
rest of the nation? 
</P>
<P>
A. Orange County is operating at right about the national average, 68%. 
Interestingly, an occupancy rate in the mid -- to high-60% range is not that 
uncommon for the hotel industry over the last 20 to 30 years. The reason people 
say the industry is in some difficulty today is that there's a lot of product 
out there that was over-invested based on the inflation expectations of the 
early 1980s and the expectations of tax writeoffs. Look at it this way: For 
Orange County to stay in the mid-60% range of occupancy with the onslaught of 
new rooms over the last couple years is quite commendable. But where the market 
has suffered is in not being able to meet expectations for room rates. That's 
why I'd prefer to use the word "over-invested" rather than "overbuilt" in 
describing this market. 
</P>
<P>
Q. We've talked about how there's no real rule of thumb for an average 
occupancy rate at which a hotel breaks even. But isn't there a fairly valid 
rule concerning how much a hotel must charge for a room based on its 
construction cost? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes, it's $1 in average room rate for every $1,000 a room cost to build. 
Therefore, if a hotel can get a rate of $65 a night, you ought to be able to 
spend around $65,000 a room to develop it. Those rules are generally valid 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What's it cost to build a new hotel room in this market? 
</P>
<P>
A. It depends on your definition of hotel room. If you were to build a 
full-service hotel near the airport, for example, to buy the land and develop 
the hotel would cost you more than $100,000 a room, which would suggest you'd 
better be near $100 a night per room to make it work. There are hotels over 
there (near John Wayne Airport) that do $100 a night, so it is plausible. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What is the average room rate near the airport these days? 
</P>
<P>
A. The latest figures show it's about $77. 
</P>
<P>
Q. One hears there are a lot of people still contemplating constructing a hotel 
in the county, perhaps after the market improves a little. Do you anticipate 
another wave of hotel building in a couple of years? 
</P>
<P>
A. There are people who are still interested in being in Orange County and who 
are in various stages of planning. But it's not a lot when compared to three or 
four years ago. What happens depends on how quickly the market rebounds. The 
market needs to get strong again and the financial institutions that loan to 
the industry have to feel good about it, especially in light of the savings and 
loan crisis. There's not a lot of enthusiasm for lending on commercial real 
estate, especially a complex type of commercial real estate like a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What chains are well-represented here, and which have yet to come in? 
</P>
<P>
A. Marriott is probably the best-represented chain; they've got a big hotel in 
Anaheim and several in the airport area. Hilton probably is next. Then it drops 
down to a variety of other people. Who's not in the market? Omni is not here, 
Stouffer is not here. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do you think they'd like to be here? Have they looked? 
</P>
<P>
A. I think all the chains consider this market a place they'd like to be. I 
couldn't say for sure about everyone, but almost every chain has looked at the 
market. It's a major metropolitan area with strong growth. On the other hand, 
you have the traffic and the smog. 
</P>
<P>
Q. A lot of hotels are built by developers next door to their office buildings 
as an inducement for tenants to lease offices. Will that continue? 
</P>
<P>
A. That'll continue, but the hotel has got to make sense on its own. It 
certainly adds to the allure of a mixed-use development to have a hotel 
integrated into it. But I'm not so sure banks and investors are going to look 
at it the same way as they did a few years back, that it might be there as a 
loss leader until the market catches up. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Most of the hotels here, I assume, are owned by someone else and merely 
franchised or managed by the hotel chain? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes, although Marriott tends to own a lot of real estate, there are very few 
hotels actually owned by the chains themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How profitable is food and drink? 
</P>
<P>
A. Most hotel operators aren't as efficient as free-standing restaurant chains. 
And beverage sales have been steadily declining over the last 10 years because 
people are drinking less due to concerns about health and fitness. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What's the outlook for the local hotel market? 
</P>
<P>
A. Barring a recession -- and I think that in itself is a big question in a lot 
of people's minds -- you would see the market in the airport area slowly, 
steadily improving. There should be growth in room rates that is at least 
consistent with inflation and maybe a little more. Anaheim is a lot healthier 
and there's more interest in building hotels there. 
</P>
<P>
Q. And there's another big problem that has nothing to do with the market, 
isn't there? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. The 1990s are going to be difficult for the hotel industry because of 
shifting demographics. Six years from today there'll be something like 5 or 6 
million fewer people between the ages of 18 and 34. Those people are the 
backbone of hotel staffs, because hotel jobs are usually low-wage and are often 
a person's first job in the marketplace. There are hotels in the Coachella 
Valley right now that have to ship employees in from their Orange County hotels 
because they're short-staffed. And, of course, finding a place to live in 
Orange County on hotel wages is not easy. It's not a crisis in Orange County 
today, but it's not going to get any better either.

MCENROE'S CHANCES NOT OF THIS WORLD

Bookmakers here figure that John McEnroe's chances of winning Wimbledon are 50 
times better than any British player, but only five times better than an alien 
landing on Earth this century. 
</P>
<P>
Against such odds, it is an uneasy McEnroe who has returned to Wimbledon, the 
most famous front yard in tennis and scene of some of his greatest triumphs. At 
31, Mac is back, all right, and consider the ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, it was McEnroe, 22, mowing down Bjorn Borg to end the Swedish grass 
king's string of Wimbledon titles at five in succession. In 1983, McEnroe won 
again, showing his old zeal in besting little-known Chris Lewis of New Zealand. 
The next year, McEnroe, 25, won his third Wimbledon championship with alarming 
ease in a thoroughly dominating performance against Jimmy Connors. 
</P>
<P>
Last year at 30, McEnroe reached the semifinals on the neatly trimmed grass 
courts of the All England Club, just as he had in his first Wimbledon 
appearance in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
But something along the same lines this time at Wimbledon, which begins its 
two-week run today, may seem far-fetched in what is probably McEnroe's last 
chance to win the biggest tournament in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to be totally committed," McEnroe said. "But it's up to me to give it 
my best shot or I won't be around for very long." 
</P>
<P>
Ranked 10th, his lowest since returning to the tour after taking sabbaticals in 
1986 and 1987, McEnroe received a generous No. 4 seeding for Wimbledon, the 
same as last year, when he was ranked a solid No. 4 and lost to Stefan Edberg 
in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Going into his first-round match against Brentwood's Derrick Rostagno, ranked 
No. 126, McEnroe is coming off another extended leave, but McEnroe's father 
does not sound worried about the prospect. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough first round for John, but I would think it is probably a tougher 
draw for Rostagno," John McEnroe Sr. said. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe has played just one tournament since mid-February, which means that at 
least he should be fresh. McEnroe reached the semifinals of last week's Stella 
Artois Grass Court Champions at the Queens Club, where he was aced 11 times and 
lost to Ivan Lendl in straight sets. That kind of pre-Wimbledon preparation 
could be suspect to many, although not to McEnroe's father. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's feeling reasonably good about things in general," the elder 
McEnroe said. "I don't think he feels in his head that 10 is where he belongs 
in the rankings, but he doesn't think that No. 1 is where he belongs either. 
But John is certainly capable of being a factor. He wants to believe he is 
capable of winning it. I think John believes that." 
</P>
<P>
What McEnroe believes is not always known. What McEnroe says, he usually shares 
generously. After he was fined $6,500 and kicked out of the Australian Open for 
an on-court tirade in his fourth-round match against Mikael Pernfors, he blamed 
an inadequate frame of mind for his problems. McEnroe said he knows his mental 
preparations must be different if he is to have a chance of winning a fourth 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be the player I've been for the last four years," McEnroe 
said. "And that's one who didn't believe in himself. That's what happened at 
the Australian Open. I almost beat myself. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw almost right away that I was hitting the ball better than anyone, but I 
wasn't mentally prepared to win a Grand Slam," he said. "I can't tell if 
(Wimbledon) is going to be too early (but) the best thing is that I'm here." 
</P>
<P>
During his latest time off, McEnroe remained busy in non-tennis activities. He 
was a frequent spectator at athletic events, sitting baseline for the Lakers 
and rinkside for the Kings. He made numerous public appearances for Nike, the 
athletic equipment manufacturer he endorses. He spent time with his family, 
wife Tatum O'Neal and young sons Kevin and Sean. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe also firmed up his homestead, selling his Carbon Beach house in Malibu 
for an estimated $3.7 million and moving into a new Malibu Colony house. 
McEnroe bought the Carbon Beach house from Johnny Carson five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Chances are, though, that events on the tennis court will prove to be no day at 
the beach for McEnroe. There are several factors riding on McEnroe's outcome at 
Wimbledon. He risks his ranking with a poor performance, since he would lose 
computer points if he fails to equal last year's semifinal showing. Last year, 
his record was 7-8 against top-10 players and he was 0-8 against the top three 
of Ivan Lendl (0-3), Edberg (0-3) and Boris Becker (0-2) in tournaments 
involving computer points. McEnroe did beat Lendl in a special event in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl has much to gain and much to lose as well. Wimbledon is the only Grand 
Slam title that has eluded him. A runner-up in 1986 and 1987 and a semifinalist 
the last two years, Lendl skipped the French Open and has spent most of the 
last five months since winning his second consecutive Australian Open title 
practicing on grass courts. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is very curious how he will do this year at Wimbledon," Edberg said. 
"He's put pressure on himself by not playing that many matches the last few 
months. He seems to be playing well (so) it will be very interesting." 
</P>
<P>
At Queens, McEnroe impressed observers in a way he probably did not want. 
Reporters said McEnroe looked thicker in the thighs and slower. Meanwhile, his 
game remains lean. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe's style of play, a finesse game based on touch and accuracy, seems to 
have isolated him from his peers. Simply, it may have fallen out of style, to 
be replaced by a power game controlled by the hard-hitters. McEnroe called his 
game a "relic from the past." On a surface the speed of grass, the emphasis on 
power over touch is even more noticeable. 
</P>
<P>
"Talent alone won't win as many matches as it once did," McEnroe said. "Now 
it's how you can hit the ball harder on every point." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Hall of Fame member Tony Trabert believes McEnroe is being done in by 
loosely strung rackets. In his book, "Trabert On Tennis," Trabert said McEnroe 
is adept at touch volleys, but they sometimes lack depth. Power players as much 
as anyone love getting a swing at a short ball. 
</P>
<P>
"Since he started stringing his rackets loosely -- in the range of 40 pounds of 
tension -- players are starting to overpower him," Trabert said. 
</P>
<P>
Trabert's advice would be to string McEnroe's racket at around 60 pounds and 
tell him to take a bigger swing at the ball. Instead, Trabert said McEnroe 
seems to just take short swings and let his racket strings sort of throw the 
ball backs across the net. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know the strategy behind that type of play, but it's easy to see that 
he's being worked over by the top players that he now goes up against," Trabert 
said. "While he still wins a good percentage of his matches, he doesn't beat 
the top two or three players consistently enough. . . . The frustration of 
being unable to do this could be enough to make McEnroe give up on tennis 
completely." 
</P>
<P>
After losing to Lendl at Queens, 6-2, 6-4, McEnroe seemed to put a time limit 
on his latest comeback. "People should judge me on how I'm going in six months' 
time." 
</P>
<P>
He starts again against Rostagno. Like McEnroe, Rostagno, 24, is a former 
Stanford star. At last year's U.S. Open, Rostagno held two match points on 
Boris Becker, then lost in nearly 4 1/2 hours. Becker went on to his first U.S. 
Open championship. Rostagno tuned up for his McEnroe matchup at Wimbledon by 
playing in a grass court exhibition last week in Wirral, England. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, seeded No. 1 for the fourth time in five years but never a Wimbledon 
champion, plays 22-year-old Christian Miniussi of Argentina, ranked No. 117. 
Lendl's draw seems relatively easy, although ninth-seeded Jim Courier is in his 
path. In his Wimbledon debut last year, Courier lost in the first round. 
Lendl's fourth-round opponent is projected to be Henri Leconte of France. 
</P>
<P>
Becker's quarter of the draw includes Yannick Noah of France, and Brad Gilbert. 
Edberg, third-seeded, could play 13th-seeded Michael Chang in the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe's second-round opponent, should he win in the first, will be Sweden's 
Peter Lundgren or England's Jeremy Bates. Pete Sampras, a first-round loser 
last year, is also in McEnroe's path. After that, well, who knows? He will play 
Becker in the semifinals, if seedings hold true. 
</P>
<P>
"John has to be an attacker, serve well and avoid distractions," John McEnroe 
Sr. said. "He's not as young as he used to be, but who is?" 
</P>
<P>
No one comes to mind right away. 
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon Notes 
</P>
<P>
The players' organizations, the Assn. of Tennis Professionals Tour and the 
Women's Tennis Assn., rejected an attempt to introduce independent drug testing 
at Wimbledon, according to the Sunday (London) Times. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that the Sports Council, the British government's sports 
agency, offered to conduct random tests to bring the tournament into line with 
other Olympic sports. 
</P>
<P>
However, the players' organizations response was that their own testing is 
sufficient.

ART DEALER DETOURS FROM THE FAST LANE; 
</P>
<P>
LERNER COULD END UP IN PRISON ON DRUG CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For Stanley R. Lerner, a 25-year-old UCLA dropout-turned-entrepreneurial 
phenom, today could be the day to say goodby to his symbols of success: the 
fire-engine red Porsche, the champagne fund-raisers, the Beverly Hills office 
with the black marble and chrome desk, the pricey paintings that hang in his 
Rodeo Drive gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Lerner is scheduled to appear before U.S. District Court Judge Robert 
Tagasuki to be sentenced on charges of conspiracy to deal cocaine. The maximum 
term: 40 years in prison and a $2-million fine. 
</P>
<P>
The sentencing will mark an abrupt passage in the free-wheeling, fast-dealing 
life of Lerner, whose brief career has included a string of business ventures 
-- from a compact disc store, to a company that tried to market an at-home AIDS 
test, to his job as president and sole owner of Triangle Galleries of Newport 
Beach and Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
At his peak, this son of middle-income parents from Montebello spent his days 
negotiating multimillion dollar art transactions involving some of the world's 
best-known painters -- Renoir, Degas, Manet. In his depths, he pleaded guilty 
to the cocaine charges. A month later, he worked as a police informant, 
producing tips that helped crack a multimillion-dollar international art fraud 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the people who know him seem baffled by Lerner's change of fortunes. 
They find it difficult to imagine that Lerner became mixed up in drug dealing 
and phony art. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't match that Stan Lerner," said one old friend, "with the Stan Lerner 
that I know." 
</P>
<P>
"He's a remarkable young man," said Brad Lemack, a public relations man who 
coordinated a celebrity art fund-raiser at Triangle Galleries in February. "I 
was impressed that he seems to have accomplished so much at such a young age. 
He's a baby. I've got ties older than that." 
</P>
<P>
Others see his case as another example of 1980s excess turned sour in 1990. He 
has plenty of foes delighted at his fall. Said one: "He was looking to make as 
much money as he could and he played with fire and got caught." 
</P>
<P>
Charming, with a quick mind and a broad smile, Lerner said he has been humbled 
in the 18 months since his arrest -- in part through a new-found devotion to 
his religion, Judaism, that takes him to synagogue five times a week. 
</P>
<P>
Lerner's cooperation with authorities in the art fraud case -- he initiated the 
relationship the month after he pleaded guilty to the cocaine charge -- has 
enabled him to delay his sentencing for nine months. His lawyer is expected to 
argue today that Lerner deserves credit, in the form of a lighter sentence, for 
his help. 
</P>
<P>
The information Lerner gave authorities helped them arrest two men he did 
business with: Lee Sonnier, the former manager of the Rodeo Drive branch of the 
Upstairs Gallery art chain; and independent art broker Frank De Marigny, who 
earlier this month pleaded no contest to charges of perjury, grand theft and 
forgery stemming from the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The Sonnier and De Marigny cases sent tremors through the world of Beverly 
Hills arts traders, raising fears that high-priced paintings might be bogus and 
generally casting a shadow of distrust over the buying and selling of art. 
</P>
<P>
Lerner has not been charged with any crime involving phony art. He was granted 
immunity -- although he said he did not need it -- in exchange for the 
testimony he would have given had De Marigny gone to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities allege that, in addition to other dealings, Sonnier and De Marigny 
conspired to sell a fake Renoir painting to a Japanese businessman while the 
original was hanging in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. De 
Marigny also was charged with trying to sell the same painting to an undercover 
officer during a sting operation that Lerner arranged last September. 
</P>
<P>
According to court testimony and other documents, and interviews with his 
former employees and associates, Lerner acted as a paid broker who helped line 
up buyers for De Marigny -- who supplied the artwork -- and Sonnier, who sold 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Lerner told authorities of six instances in which he bought paintings credited 
to French Impressionists from De Marigny and sold them to Sonnier. Five of 
those pieces -- along with the phony Renoir -- were later purchased by a 
Japanese businessman who claims the works were either fake or never delivered. 
Lerner said he did not believe the pieces were fake. 
</P>
<P>
In a civil suit filed against, among others, Lerner, De Marigny and Sonnier, 
businessman Koichi Akemoto claims he was bilked out of more than $2 million. 
While Lerner denies the allegation, Akemoto's lawyers say they have evidence 
that Sonnier paid Lerner at least $800,000 last summer -- money that they 
believe was in return for Lerner's help in procuring phony artworks for their 
client. 
</P>
<P>
While Akemoto's civil lawyers are trying to recover money from Lerner, defense 
lawyers for De Marigny and Sonnier have attempted to paint him as a convicted 
criminal who pinned blame on their clients because it might help him get a 
lighter sentence on his cocaine charge. 
</P>
<P>
Perry Wander, who represented De Marigny in the early stages of the case, said: 
"I think it's a travesty of justice the way they are prosecuting Frank like 
gangbusters and Stan is out walking around, selling art. I've told the D.A., 
'You are prosecuting the wrong guy.' " 
</P>
<P>
While prosecutor Reva Goetz, in charge of the art fraud case, declines to 
discuss the cases, Lerner dismisses such accusations, saying he went to 
authorities the instant he learned he had sold phony work and that it was only 
proper for him to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"My actions speak for themselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But others, including the man who was convicted as Lerner's co-conspirator in 
the cocaine case, describe him as a tough businessman who fancies himself a 
high-roller and who, before his arrest, leased a luxurious condominium 
overlooking Wilshire Boulevard, wore Armani suits, drove Porsches, Mercedeses 
and a Ferrari, and once displayed a high-powered assault weapon to a friend. 
They are suspicious of Lerner's claim that he has undergone religious 
transformation. 
</P>
<P>
"When you meet him you are going to be charmed out of your mind," said one 
business associate. "He's very charismatic, very intelligent. He's got this big 
boy smile and you're gonna think, 'How could anyone say anything bad about this 
guy?' " 
</P>
<P>
In two lengthy interviews -- one of them over lunch at a Beverly Hills 
restaurant where he knew all the waiters and the maitre d' -- Lerner was 
personable, witty and seemingly eager to talk. But there were two things he 
would not discuss on the record: his cocaine conviction and his role in the art 
fraud investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Describing himself as an "entrepreneur," Lerner said he established his art 
business with an initial investment of a few thousand dollars and a bit of help 
from his friends. "Donald Trump has his art of the deal and I have mine," he 
said. "I didn't have money so I either borrowed it or I was very fortunate. 
People helped me." 
</P>
<P>
Those who know Lerner consider his Trump reference apt. They describe him as 
smart and ambitious, with an ego that knows no bounds. 
</P>
<P>
At Montebello High School, Lerner graduated seventh in a class of 449 students 
and competed in tennis, water polo and swimming. His teachers recall that he 
was very bright, but once called his parents in to discuss his insubordination. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't tell the kid anything," said Tim Murphy, the school's athletic 
director and Lerner's former swim coach. "It was just like he had the world by 
the tail. He had all the answers." 
</P>
<P>
Lerner attended UCLA but quit in June, 1985, he said, to help with the family 
auto parts business when his father became ill. 
</P>
<P>
He became involved in the art world in September, 1986 -- at the age of 21 -- 
when he agreed to pay an art publisher, Robert Bane, $30,000 to produce limited 
edition reproductions. Court records show the venture fell apart in a legal 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
By March, 1987, Lerner was leasing more than 2,200 square feet on the 27th 
floor of one of the Century City Towers on Century Park East, at a cost of 
nearly $4,800 a month. His former lawyer and office mate, Joel Spivak, said 
Lerner was always dabbling in some new endeavor -- a computerized clearinghouse 
for art dealers, an at-home AIDS test and the compact disc store. But, Spivak 
added, these ventures never seemed to get very far. 
</P>
<P>
By November, 1988, Lerner had moved out of the office tower amid a rent dispute 
and was in prison at Terminal Island. 
</P>
<P>
He had been arrested by the FBI on allegations that he conspired to distribute 
five kilograms of cocaine. No one involved in the investigation would 
elaborate. Because the case was not tried, no details have emerged. 
</P>
<P>
Lerner was released when the charges were dropped for lack of evidence. The 
indictment was reinstated and he pleaded guilty last August. 
</P>
<P>
Lerner said he started working as an art broker shortly after his release from 
prison. He founded Triangle Galleries in April, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
He would not say how he became involved with De Marigny and Sonnier. While some 
say he earned hundreds of thousands of dollars from their sales, he apparently 
wasn't paying his bills on time. Former employees said paychecks were often 
late and suppliers were frequently calling for money. 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, this is the same Stan Lerner who now lives with his recently 
widowed mother in Montebello, who says he gets more enjoyment from praying than 
from driving his Porsche, who hosts charity fund-raisers, and who once paid a 
homeless artist to paint in front of his gallery because he felt sorry for him. 
</P>
<P>
The same Stan Lerner who, when asked if he is worried about going to prison, 
drinks a sip of mineral water at a Rodeo Drive cafe, takes a deep breath and 
responds: 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that anyone can expect of themselves is to do the best thing he 
can do everyday. I feel like if I can continue to do the best that I can do 
everyday for myself and for other people, then things will work out." 
</P>
