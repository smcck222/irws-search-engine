A Soviet submarine was reported on fire off the coast of northern Norway early 
today. It was not known if the vessel was carrying nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Gullow Gjeseth, a spokesman for Norway's Defense Ministry, said, "We 
detected a call for help from a Soviet submarine in international waters off 
the coast and sent an F-16 (fighter jet) to inspect the area." 
</P>
<P>
The F-16's pilot reported that the submarine was on the surface and surrounded 
by heavy smoke in international waters some 70 miles northwest of South Island, 
Defense Minister Johan Jorgen Holst said on state radio. It was not immediately 
apparent what class of submarine was on fire, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
3 Soviet Planes in Area 
</P>
<P>
Gjeseth said there were three Soviet aircraft in the area and that one 
Norwegian rescue helicopter was on its way to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass reported the fire, quoting Norwegian 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
Tass did not say whether the sub was carrying nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Rescue services in Norway received disaster signals from the submarine, and 
corresponding services in the Soviet city of Murmansk, on the Kola peninsula, 
were notified, Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have started a rescue operation, it said. 
</P>
<P>
No other details were immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
This decade, there have been at least four deadly Soviet submarine accidents, 
the most recent coming April 7, when a Soviet Mike-class nuclear attack 
submarine caught fire and sank about 300 miles off Norway, leaving 42 of the 69 
men aboard dead.

A TIME OF DANGER; 
</P>
<P>
BLIND SPOT IS A MENACE FOR SURFACING SUBMARINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Carefully, deliberately and by the book, the crewmen maneuvered the U.S. Navy 
submarine up from the depths of the Mediterranean Sea. They listened to the 
sonar for telltale noises. Nothing. The order was given to climb. 
</P>
<P>
As the periscope poked above the surface, the looming image of a 100,000-ton 
tanker came into focus, dead ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"He was so big that even head-on, bow-on . . . we couldn't hear his screws 
(propellers) through his hull, so we didn't know he was there," recalled 
retired Vice Admiral Patrick J. Hannifin. "We came up and went down in a 
hurry." 
</P>
<P>
Hannifin's submarine escaped harm's way during the near-collision, which 
occurred more than a decade ago in the Mediterranean Sea. Two weeks ago, off 
the coast of Los Angeles, the crew of the submarine Houston was not so 
fortunate. The crew of the tugboat Barcona was less fortunate still. 
</P>
<P>
The nuclear-powered Houston, on standby for filming of the motion picture "The 
Hunt for Red October," a fictional saga of a Soviet submarine skipper's 
defection to the United States, snagged the Barcona's steel tow cable and 
yanked the tugboat backward and under in less than a minute. One crew member 
drowned and two others survived. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy spokeswoman at the Houston's home port in San Diego called the incident 
"freakish," but the submarine only two days later, operating in roughly the 
same waters, sliced through a trawler's fishing net. The Navy says both 
incidents are under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials have left many questions unanswered in the two recent accidents 
off the Southern California coast involving the Houston, a fast-attack 
submarine. But evidence has emerged that at least one of the incidents occurred 
while the Houston was in a blind spot similar to the one described by submarine 
experts interviewed last week. 
</P>
<P>
Strange as it may seem to civilians, submarine experts say that highly 
sophisticated Navy submarines sometimes travel through the oceans of the world 
nearly blind to what is around them. In fact, during some maneuvers the 
submarine captain operates with a blind spot not unlike a driver changing lanes 
on a freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Under Navy policy, submarines rarely use the sensitive "active" sonar systems 
on board because in order to do so they must emit signals that could reveal 
their location. Instead, they rely on "passive sonar," which means carefully 
listening for the sound of engines, clanking chains or any other auditory 
clues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Noise, No Detection 
</P>
<P>
But if a vessel is not making any noise, there is little chance that the 
submariners will detect it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite extraordinary," said Angus Peetz, a research aide to George 
Foulkes, a member of the British Parliament who has pressed for a full-scale 
investigation of similar sub incidents off the British Isles. "They can hit 
targets 2,000 miles away, but they can't spot a fishing boat above them." 
</P>
<P>
While the issue of sub collisions is something relatively new to California 
mariners, it has been a growing controversy in Britain and Ireland. Members of 
both the British and Irish parliaments are demanding to know what role 
submarines may have played in the "mysterious" disappearances, sinkings and 
snaggings of several dozen fishing boats in the Irish Sea, resulting in the 
loss of more than 100 lives since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the U.S. and British navies have said that their submarines have 
not been involved in fatal incidents in the area. However, officials in both 
navies have confirmed details of collisions and several snaggings involving 
submarines and civilian vessels. 
</P>
<P>
The collisions, naval experts say, illustrate a point that remains true today: 
Surfacing from the deep is a maneuver that challenges even the most experienced 
skippers with the highest-tech gadgets on board. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Most Vulnerable Time 
</P>
<P>
"It's that time when the submarine is most vulnerable," said Hannifin, who was 
commander of all U.S. and NATO submarines in the Mediterranean from 1971 to 
1973, then went on to become the director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. "He's 
really blind. The problem is that a submarine completely submerged can't see 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
"It can hear, but it can't see. It can hear a fishing boat, for example, if the 
fishing boat is running its engines. What it can't hear are fishing nets or 
barges being towed, because barges don't make any noise." 
</P>
<P>
In order to minimize the chances of running into another vessel, submarines 
generally travel well below the surface. When it is time to ascend, they move 
swiftly to periscope depth. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a period, truly, of uncertainty as you go through this transition 
from the deep submerged state to a shallow submerged state, and so you very 
carefully search around," said Capt. Thomas C. Maloney, retired commanding 
officer of a nuclear-powered submarine of the same class as the Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"You maneuver the ship to see if there's some target behind you," Maloney said, 
"and then you very quickly try to bring the ship up so you can look out through 
the periscope." 
</P>
<P>
Maloney described the transition period as a tension-filled time and compared 
it to an automobile on a freeway. "Once in a while, you get ready to change 
lanes and all of a sudden you find there's somebody in your blind spot," 
Maloney said, "even though you thought you've done a pretty careful search." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Masked Sounds 
</P>
<P>
Such events occur rarely, Maloney said, and explanations vary. Sometimes 
another loud ship in the distance masks the sound of the closer ship, he said. 
Or sometimes it's simply a sailboat that was making no detectable noise. 
</P>
<P>
Still, active sonar, which is capable of detecting silent objects, is rarely 
used. Using passive sonar, a submarine crew member simply listens for noises, 
but with active sonar, the operator can send out sound waves that will bounce 
back to the submarine with a "ping" if it strikes an object. 
</P>
<P>
The active system works best in detecting totally submerged objects, Maloney 
said, but is less reliable when aimed at the surface. Depth, water conditions, 
surface waves and other variables all can generate sonar "clutter" that cuts 
down on reliability, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The overriding reason that active sonar is rarely used, however, is security. 
</P>
<P>
"When you use active sonar, you give your position away," said James Bush, a 
retired Navy captain and former submarine commander who now works with the 
Washington-based Center for Defense Information. 
</P>
<P>
Active sonar is generally reserved for "battle situations," Bush said. "You're 
going to shoot a torpedo at him anyway, so why not make sure you know exactly 
where he is." 
</P>
<P>
In any case, Bush and others said, it is highly unlikely that any sonar system 
would detect a fishing net. Navy officials confirm that fishermen from around 
the world have been reimbursed for nets and catches lost when submarines 
accidentally sliced through them, but precise figures were not made available 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Moffat, general secretary of the Celtic League, an organization that 
fosters cooperation among the Celtic areas of the British Isles, has been 
monitoring military activity in the narrow, relatively shallow and heavily 
fished strip of sea between Ireland and mainland Britain known to submarine 
crew members as "Rat's Run." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
100 Civilian Deaths 
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, he said, there have been 21 disappearances of civilian vessels and 
more than 100 civilian deaths. The incidents have occurred in calm-to-moderate 
sea conditions, and Moffat claims that at least some of them probably are 
linked to submarines. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, the British Navy paid damages after the submarine HMS Porpoise sank a 
fishing boat. All crew members were rescued. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. submarine involvement in other accidents is less certain. Moffat 
acknowledges that "we can't say they're definitely linked to submarines," but 
he insists that "in almost all cases, the incidents occurred in what are listed 
on admiralty charts as designated submarine exercise areas." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Navy officials confirm only a handful of close encounters in the Irish 
Sea. 
</P>
<P>
In April, a British trawler named Laurel was apparently snagged by an American 
sub off the Isle of Man. The U.S. Navy released a report saying only that the 
crew had no indication of the snagging, but minor paint scrapes found on the 
sub "were assumed to be the result of the snagging." An investigation is 
continuing, the Navy said. 
</P>
<P>
Three months earlier, U.S. officials say, a surface collision occurred between 
a U.S. submarine and the fishing vessel New Dawn. Authorities are awaiting a 
resolution with the insurance company representing the boat owner. 
</P>
<P>
Net-snagging incidents in 1987 prompted the U.S. Navy to pay out more than 
28,000 British pounds in damages to the owners of the British fishing vessels 
Heroine and Summer Morn.

JUDGE BLOCKS ROSE HEARING FOR TWO WEEKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
An Ohio judge has blocked baseball's commissioner from holding a hearing that 
could have resulted in Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose's being banned from 
the game for his alleged gambling activities. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Norbert A. Nadel, deciding that Commissioner 
Bart Giamatti had "prejudged" Rose, Sunday granted Rose a temporary restraining 
order that delayed today's scheduled hearing until at least July 6. 
</P>
<P>
"Giamatti could not be impartial," the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Nadel said no action may be taken against Rose for two weeks. The judge said 
that on July 6 he will 
</P>
<P>
consider a motion for a preliminary injunction that would put the case on hold 
while he decides whether he or Giamatti should decide Rose's fate. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Charles O. Finley, Ted Turner and other team owners have gone 
to court to challenge the broad powers given to baseball's commissioners, but 
none have succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
The constitutional guarantees of due process do not always apply to private 
organizations such as organized sports. The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed 
that principle in supporting the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. sanctions 
against Jerry Tarkanian, Nevada Las Vegas basketball coach, for rules 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
Nadel acknowledged Friday that allowing a court to intervene would be going 
into "previously uncharted waters." 
</P>
<P>
Rose was not in the packed courtroom for the decision. He was at nearby 
Riverfront Stadium for Sunday's game against the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
In a pregame interview with radio station WLW, Rose said he was pleased with 
the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they proved (Giamatti) already made up his mind," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
"It just wasn't going to be a fair hearing, in my eyes. It was obvious he 
believed my accusers." 
</P>
<P>
"I think we got justice," said Rose's attorney, Reuven Katz. 
</P>
<P>
Giamatti, the former president of Yale University, issued a statement saying: 
"I regret the judge's decision. I have absolutely no prejudgment or prejudice 
regarding Pete Rose. We will contest this matter tooth and nail." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Investigator 
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented decision came two days after a hearing in which baseball's 
special investigator, John Dowd, revealed that he has evidence that Rose bet on 
major league baseball, including Reds games, in 1985, 1986 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Nadel, after reading a letter that Giamatti signed on behalf of 
Rose's chief accuser, Ronald Peters, said: "It appears to this court that the 
commissioner has prejudged Peter Edward Rose." 
</P>
<P>
The letter, dated April 18, 1989, was drafted by Dowd and signed by Giamatti. 
It was sent to Judge Carl B. Rubin of the Southern District of Ohio, where 
Peters was about to be sentenced on charges of cocaine trafficking and tax 
evasion, and said in part: "It is my purpose to bring to your attention the 
significant and truthful cooperation Mr. Peters has provided to my special 
counsel. I am satisfied Mr. Peters has been candid, forthright and truthful 
with my special counsel." 
</P>
<P>
Nadel also said he thought Rose's career would be irreparably harmed if today's 
scheduled hearing were held. 
</P>
<P>
Rose could be suspended for a year if it is determined that he bet on major 
league games. He could be banned for life if he is found to have wagered on 
Reds' games. 
</P>
<P>
The judge got the case after Rose's lawyers sued on June 19, asserting that 
Rose had been denied a fair investigation by Dowd.

INDIA GUNMEN KILL 26 HINDUS; SIKHS BLAMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gunmen sprayed machine-gun fire and detonated two powerful bombs Sunday at an 
outdoor meeting of a militant Hindu organization in the northern state of 
Punjab, killing at least 26 people and injuring two dozen others in the worst 
violence this year in the strategic, strife-torn state. 
</P>
<P>
Calling the massacre "a most dastardly and cowardly attack by nefarious 
people," Punjabi Gov. S. S. Ray declared an indefinite curfew in the area and 
ordered police to capture the gunmen "dead or alive within seven days." 
</P>
<P>
Police officials blamed the attack on a militant Sikh organization called the 
Khalistan Commando Force. Khalistan is the militants' name for a hoped-for 
separate Sikh state they would like to see carved out of Punjab, India's most 
fertile and once most-prosperous state. 
</P>
<P>
In New Delhi, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's minister for internal security, 
Buta Singh, declared the massacre to be "the biggest in recent times" and said 
that it is "a very serious attempt on the part of terrorists to whip up tension 
along communal (religious) lines." 
</P>
<P>
The organization targeted by the gunmen Sunday is one of India's largest and 
most militant national Hindu groups, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, or 
National Volunteer Corps. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Martial Arts, Fervor 
</P>
<P>
When the attack took place, the group's members were meeting in a park in the 
Punjabi town of Moga, one of hundreds of such gatherings in which the volunteer 
corps teaches martial arts and mobilizes religious fervor among India's 
dominant religious group. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that a van pulled up to the gathering and half a dozen men began 
firing at random. Nearly an hour after they sped away, a time bomb exploded at 
the scene of the shootings, killing two police investigators and a bystander. 
Later, a second bomb went off in the park but caused no casualties. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to play down the religious implications of an attack that many 
fear could further inflame the situation in Punjab state, where thousands have 
been killed since the militant Sikh campaign began in 1982, Gov. Ray tried to 
place the ultimate blame on Pakistan, which borders the Punjab. 
</P>
<P>
"The perpetrators of this ghastly crime are neither Hindus nor Sikhs, but 
animals hired by vested interests, principally from across our border, to 
create chaos, confusion and division in our sacred land," Ray said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a recent warming of relations, India has often accused Pakistan of 
abetting the Sikh militants. Allegations of Pakistani involvement in the 
conflict have never been proved conclusively. 
</P>
<P>
After Sunday's attack, however, several analysts in New Delhi speculated that 
the massacre also may have serious political ramifications for Prime Minister 
Gandhi as this year's national elections approach. 
</P>
<P>
Gandhi, who succeeded his mother, Indira, after she was assassinated by two of 
her Sikh bodyguards in 1984, must stand for reelection before the end of this 
year, and religion is likely to be one of the key issues. 
</P>
<P>
The National Volunteer Corps represents a huge, nationwide voting bloc centered 
in the central Indian region known as the Hindi heartland, which political 
analysts say is the key to winning a national election. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the Hindu militants have been speaking out against Gandhi's 
government, and Sunday's massacre almost certainly will alienate the group 
still further from Gandhi's secular Congress-I ruling party.

A 72-year-old nun shot in the head by a gunman in El Salvador last week was 
writing notes and squeezing the fingers of nurses in Houston's St. Paul 
Hospital, good evidence she was recovering, her doctor said. "We have upgraded 
her condition today from critical to serious," said Dr. Robert Baker. Sister 
Mary Stanislaus Mackey, a member of Houston's Sisters of Charity of the 
Incarnate Word, and two other nuns were driving near San Salvador when four 
gunmen pulled alongside and fired a shot.

The head of the grand jury that examined Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's role in the 
death of Mary Jo Kopechne says the panel never got a chance to properly 
investigate the fatal accident because of a political "cover-up," Newsweek 
reported. The Massachusetts Democrat received a suspended sentence for leaving 
the scene of an accident, but the grand jury never pursued felony charges, said 
Leslie Leland, foreman of the Dukes County grand jury. Kennedy could not 
immediately be reached for comment. Kopechne, a passenger, was killed July 18, 
1969, when the car Kennedy was driving across the bridge at Chappaquiddick on 
Martha's Vineyard, Mass., skidded into the water. Leland said the grand jury 
was prevented from subpoenaing witnesses or examining a copy of the inquest.

Caretaker Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, who contracted pneumonia a day 
after his Greek election defeat last week, has been placed on a dialysis 
machine in critical condition with kidney complications, his doctors said. A 
team of two heart specialists and three kidney specialists arrived from London, 
and they were taken immediately to Athens General Hospital. Papandreou, 70, was 
admitted to the hospital late Thursday with respiratory problems, which later 
developed into heart and kidney trouble. Meanwhile, a crowd of supporters 
gathered outside the hospital as Papandreou was visited by friends and 
relatives, including his American-born ex-wife, Margaret, his four children and 
his fiancee, Dimitra Liani.

Britain's opposition Labor Party jumped to a 14-point lead over Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher's governing Conservative Party among voters questioned in an 
opinion poll. The survey follows the trouncing of the Conservatives by Labor in 
recent European Parliament elections. Labor won its first national election 
victory since 1974 in the June 15 vote. The Observer-Harris poll, conducted 
last week, showed Labor with the support of 48% of those questioned and the 
Conservatives with 34%. The environmental Greens party, which also scored well 
in the European Parliament balloting, held the support of 8%, while the 
centrist Social and Liberal Democrats fell to 6%.

A sailor aboard a disabled pleasure boat and five crewmen from a passing 
freighter, who tried to rescue him but also fell victim to rough seas, were 
finally rescued about 900 miles west of San Francisco, the Coast Guard said. 
The Panamanian merchant ship, Washington Rainbow II, received a Mayday call 
from the sailor when his boat, Juicy Anna, lost a mast and began taking on 
water, Coast Guard officials said in Long Beach. After the 45-year-old San 
Francisco captain of the Juicy Anna, whose name was not immediately available, 
lost his life raft, five crew members from the merchant ship launched their 
lifeboat and pulled the man safely aboard, officials said. But the lifeboat 
lost power in the 15-foot seas, which Hall described as "hazardous" to small 
vessels. Coast Guard officials then contacted a 560-foot American-registered 
freighter, the President Lincoln, to go to the area and crew members rescued 
the six men, the Coast Guard said.

A suburban Boston prosecutor said he will seek to charge hundreds of 
anti-abortion demonstrators with a violation of the state's Civil Rights Act 
instead of merely with disorderly conduct. Norfolk County Dist. Atty. William 
Delahunt said the new charges would represent the first time in Massachusetts, 
and probably in the nation, that interfering with a woman's right to an 
abortion would be interpreted as a civil rights violation. He said he would 
drop disorderly conduct charges against about 360 people today and file the 
civil rights charges, which would have to be considered later by a grand jury. 
Civil rights violations can bring a jail term of up to a year and a fine of up 
to $1,000.

Poland's Communist-led trade unions demanded a price freeze until a new 
government is formed, saying public upheavals are likely if the cost of living 
keeps rising, the official PAP news agency reported. Authorities raised 
gasoline prices 40% and announced that an 83% boost in cigarette prices will 
take effect today. A series of stiff increases last week included sugar (66%), 
liquor (50%), refrigerators (67%) and washing machines (37%). Lech Walesa, 
leader of the independent trade union Solidarity, was in rare agreement with 
the government-backed unions. "I am afraid that the people may not stand the 
hikes," he said.

DEATH ROW INMATES -- GROWING NUMBERS STRAINING THE SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN QUENTIN, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the warden of San Quentin prison, Daniel Vasquez has the legal 
responsibility to carry out all sentences of death in California. 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, he has tested the 51-year-old gas chamber to make sure it 
works and selected an execution team. He even has a good idea of who is most 
likely to die in California's first execution since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
But despite a state Supreme Court that regularly affirms death sentences, 
Vasquez has no idea when he will be called upon to follow through on a death 
sentence. It could be later this year. It may be years from now. 
</P>
<P>
After spending half a dozen years as San Quentin's warden and therefore in 
charge of California's condemned population, Vasquez is philosophical about it 
all. "What is imminent?" the warden asked. "Does such a word exist for 
condemned inmates?" 
</P>
<P>
The reality is that executions remain a "far-off concept" in California, he 
said. California is not alone. Nearly all states with a Death Row face the same 
situation: People are being sentenced to death at a rate of 250 a year 
throughout the country, yet fewer and fewer executions are taking place. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, an unprecedented 2,200 condemned inmates are straining prisons in 
most of the 34 states that have a Death Row. Questions of morality and fine 
legal points aside, some prison experts have started to wonder whether capital 
punishment is more trouble than it is worth. 
</P>
<P>
"From what I can tell, the courts, whether right or wrong, aren't allowing the 
states to enforce it. The issue is: If it's not going to be enforced what is 
the point?" asked Scott M. Wallace, a death penalty expert at the American 
Correctional Assn., which represents prison officials and staff. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of capital punishment long have used the argument that the death 
penalty should be abolished because it clogs the criminal justice system. Now, 
a National Institute of Justice-funded report prepared by the American 
Correctional Assn. may bolster that argument. 
</P>
<P>
The report does not take a position on the death penalty. But it cites an array 
of problems wrought by the growing number of Death Row inmates: 
</P>
<P>
* The rising condemned population is "the primary concern of the 40 wardens 
surveyed" in the report. Several states plan to move condemned inmates to 
expanded rows at new or remodeled prisons to ease overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
* Wardens believe that there will be more executions in future years, making 
Death Row prisoners more desperate. In response, officials have tightened 
security to protect their staffs and to guard against escapes. 
</P>
<P>
* At the same time, the number of executions has dropped in every year since 
1981, when there were 21 state-sanctioned killings. There were 11 last year. 
Eight executions so far this year suggest that another year will pass with the 
logjam firmly in place. 
</P>
<P>
* Acting on behalf of prisoners who are spending increasing numbers of years on 
Death Row, prisoners' rights lawyers have filed at least 23 major lawsuits over 
prison conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Inmates have litigated over the right to marry, receive visits from wives that 
include limited physical contact, have more access to better law libraries, 
spend more time on exercise yards and to not undergo body cavity searches. 
</P>
<P>
To fend off such suits, correctional officials create procedures to deal in the 
most minute detail with the condemned inmates' lives, specifying everything 
from the number of showers they may take to the number of blankets issued. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Housing Standards 
</P>
<P>
Condemned prisoners have won court orders that establish housing standards in 
six states, including California. Violations of the court-enforced agreements, 
generally called consent decrees, can result in contempt citations against the 
states. 
</P>
<P>
"Consent decrees add a great deal of work and trouble to the staff because they 
give more rights to the inmates. It increases their workload. They have to be 
more careful," said Wallace, who was editor of the American Correction Assn. 
report titled "Management of Death Row Inmates." 
</P>
<P>
In California, Department of Corrections officials represented by the state 
attorney general have launched a broad attack to dismantle this state's Death 
Row consent decree. The decree, signed in 1980, sought to settle a sweeping 
suit over conditions on San Quentin's Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
San Quentin's Death Row meets all "minimum" constitutional requirements, Deputy 
Atty. Gen. John Donhoff argues. The settlement that was struck when there were 
40 condemned inmates no longer applies, he says, now that there are 259 
condemned men. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Request Being Considered 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Stanley Weigel, who oversees the decree, is considering the 
request. It's "not highly likely" Weigel will set aside the Death Row 
settlement, said Deputy Atty. Gen. Kristofer Jorstad, in charge of the prison 
law section in the attorney general's office. But he said the state intends to 
pursue the issue to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"It places restrictions on them (the prison). They'd prefer to not have any 
restrictions," said Sallyanne Campbell of the Prison Law Office, which filed 
the Death Row suit in 1979 on behalf of six original Death Row inmates and 
attempts to force the state to comply with its provisions. 
</P>
<P>
As it is, each new condemned inmate receives a copy of the decree upon his 
arrival. Officers assigned to the row go through training courses that cover 
points in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-page document specifies the amount of time inmates may spend out of 
their cells, the educational opportunities available, the types of clothing 
they can wear, the furnishings their cells must have and all other aspects of 
life on Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Broad Authority 
</P>
<P>
Weigel in 1985 appointed Robert Riggs, his former law clerk, to act as monitor 
of the decree. Riggs has broad authority to visit the prison, convene hearings 
to investigate conditions, and he makes recommendations to Weigel. At Weigel's 
direction, the state pays Riggs $100 an hour, a raise over the $75 an hour he 
received when he started. 
</P>
<P>
The state signed the agreement hoping to end what promised to be drawn-out 
litigation. Instead, there has been continuous wrangling. The case fills 20 
volumes in the federal courthouse in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
As the condemned population grows, Vasquez is chafing under the settlement. He 
said that while many of its provisions are reasonable, "the safety of this 
institution" would be threatened if he followed each aspect of the decree. 
</P>
<P>
The question of restraints continues to rankle the warden. When he became San 
Quentin's warden in 1983, officers, as the settlement mandated, could not place 
handcuffs on prisoners when they escorted inmates to the visiting room. 
</P>
<P>
But Vasquez is convinced that when voters ousted Chief Justice Rose Bird in 
1986, prisoners concluded that they had a worse chance of winning reversals and 
became more of an escape threat. He decided that his officers should start 
using restraints whenever they moved prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deal Was Reached 
</P>
<P>
But first, he had to negotiate with prisoners' lawyers. A deal was reached: 
Vasquez could use restraints, but inmates who had the money could buy electric 
typewriters with enough memory to store about 10 pages of material. 
</P>
<P>
The typewriters pose no particular security threat. Still, Vasquez does not 
believe that he should have to had to negotiate over what he sees as a basic 
safety measure. 
</P>
<P>
"That is how dangerous and ludicrous that kind of a system is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, prisoners' lawyers asked that Riggs recommend that the state be 
held in contempt of court for failing to let them out of their cells to mingle 
inside their cellblock. At the time the consent decree was signed, San Quentin 
still used the original Death Row. Its design allowed for out-of-cell time. But 
the population long since has outgrown that tier. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of creating a similar design in East Block, where most condemned 
inmates are housed now, would be $100 million, officials say. Inmates' lawyers 
contend that the figure is vastly inflated, and that it could be done with 
minimal cost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prisoners Moved 
</P>
<P>
Corrections officials acknowledge that San Quentin's turn-of-the-century design 
is less than ideal for housing the highest-security inmates, those on Death 
Row. 
</P>
<P>
The department has moved maximum-security prisoners who are not condemned to 
new prisons in the state. About 2,800 medium- and minimum-security inmates are 
imprisoned at San Quentin now. 
</P>
<P>
With the condemned population nearing 300, the Department of Corrections is 
considering alternatives to San Quentin and East Block. Vasquez submitted a 
proposal to the department in February. The department hopes to come up with a 
plan later this year, said Deputy Director Robert Denninger, in charge of 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
If all of East Block were used for the condemned, there would be cells for 500 
inmates. But the consent decree requires that the prison give prisoners 29 3/4 
hours of outside exercise time a week. And with 500 inmates in East Block, 
there could be a shortage of exercise yards, noted James L. Park, consultant to 
the joint legislative committee on prison construction and former associate 
warden at San Quentin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suggestions Offered 
</P>
<P>
Some planners have suggested building a prison specifically for condemned 
prisoners on vacant land at San Quentin. Some have suggested moving them to one 
or more of the recently built high-security prisons. 
</P>
<P>
Before Death Row can be moved, state law, which mandates that it be at San 
Quentin, would have to be changed. Such a change in the law would result in 
hearings likely to elicit an emotional debate over capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we willing to budget a million dollars to relocate the gas chamber?" Park 
said. "Imagine the environmental studies. When the thing is vented, it vents 
cyanide gas. It's supposed to be neutralized by the time it leaves, but I 
wouldn't want to be up there sniffing it." 
</P>
<P>
The housing issue will not go away any time soon. California courts will 
sentence as many as 40 people to death this year. While the Bird court reversed 
the bulk of the death penalty cases to go before it, the court of Chief Justice 
Malcolm Lucas upholds more than twice as many sentences as it reverses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Residents 
</P>
<P>
But because inmates have a right to pursue appeals in habeas corpus actions in 
the state and federal courts, most of the condemned prisoners will remain on 
the row for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
"The logjam has never broken and probably never will break, because this 
society is simply not equipped to kill people without due process," said 
Michael Lawrence of the NAACP death penalty project in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez, more familiar than most with the implications of the logjam, was among 
the few people who noticed that an anniversary passed on Death Row on March 14. 
On that date, Robert Alton Harris had been on the row for one decade. 
</P>
<P>
Harris has used more appeals by far than any other condemned inmate in this 
state. Many people believe that he will be the first to be executed in 
California since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what we say to each other. The attorney general says that to me. I say 
that to the attorney general. But nobody really knows," Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Death Sentence Affirmed 
</P>
<P>
In each of the last three years, California's top law enforcement officials 
have predicted that Harris would be executed. The state Supreme Court affirmed 
his death sentence in 1981 for the killings of two teen-age boys in San Diego 
in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
His case has been in the federal courts ever since, most recently before the 
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. With the year more than half over, it is 
unlikely that Harris will die in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Harris is executed this year or next, no one will follow him on the 
long walk for years, unless an inmate drops all appeals or there is a dramatic 
change in the criminal justice system. No other condemned inmate is within two 
years of completing the judicial steps to the gas chamber, attorneys who handle 
death penalty appeals say. 
</P>
<P>
"In a sense, we get the best of all worlds," former San Quentin Associate 
Warden Park said. "The vicious, terrible criminal is sentenced to death. Then 
he never gets killed, so nobody has to feel bad about it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Preparations Continue 
</P>
<P>
Still, the man who by law must carry out the sentences continues to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
"What I tell my staff," Warden Vasquez said, "is that there's one person who is 
not to survive the ritual of the execution, and that is the condemned inmate. 
We have to survive. We have to go back to our families, our children, our loved 
ones, intact, emotionally and physically healthy." 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Vasquez fights any attempt to make lethal injections or the 
electric chair the method of execution in California. Workers would have to get 
too close to the condemned man to find a usable vein or shave his head in 
preparation for a fatal electric jolt. In the gas chamber, contact is minimal. 
Inmates are strapped down, and the heavy steel door is shut. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not an executioner," the warden said. "I wasn't born with a little black 
hood over my head with the eyes cut out. My mother didn't give birth to an 
executioner. I carry out the law and so do my staff."

POLITICIANS TRY TO DEFUSE NORTHWEST LOGGING FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK A. STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>

SALEM, Ore. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort closely watched in California and Washington, eight top Oregon 
politicians have proposed a temporary cease-fire in the jobs-versus-nature 
fight that has been blamed for crippling the Pacific Northwest logging 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
The four-point bipartisan proposal attempts to expand timber harvests and cut 
layoffs over the next 15 months by asking environmental groups to exchange 
their court-ordered environmental protections for less-restrictive industry 
pledges to improve its harvesting practices. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon's seven-member congressional delegation, along with Gov. Neil 
Goldschmidt, unanimously agreed to make the proposal while moderating a daylong 
summit meeting Saturday between loggers and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides have been told to respond to the proposal by noon Tuesday, in time 
to increase timber harvest levels in a 1990 budget bill scheduled for an 
important committee vote Wednesday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Timber interests were cautiously optimistic about the compromise, but 
environmentalists were skeptical about agreeing to the harvest of specific 
volumes of timber in exchange for vague industry promises to protect vanishing 
old-growth timber and the increasingly rare northern spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
However, Democratic Rep. Les AuCoin said the proposal is essential to "get the 
pistol away from the temple of the environmentalists as well as industry" as 
the controversy over the spotted owl ratchets higher with every mill closure. 
</P>
<P>
Such an agreement is essential, said Republican Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, to give 
Congress enough "breathing room" to draft and enact fundamental reforms of the 
nation's environmental laws to accommodate both loggers and nature. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and loggers at the hearing here Saturday agreed that changes 
in the law are essential, but Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio said Congress is 
not likely to act soon. 
</P>
<P>
"There will not be major changes in the law in the very short order," he said 
during the session in the tightly secured Salem City Council chamber. "There 
may be great willingness among this delegation to tackle this problem, but we 
have to work within a Congress that is not very willing to wade into our 
dispute." 
</P>
<P>
Federal timber policy traditionally has been left up to legislators from those 
Western states with most of the federal forests, particularly Oregon, 
California and Washington. Those three states, in that order, are the nation's 
top timber producers. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure has grown on members of Congress from those states to do something 
about timber sales postponed by recent court orders won by environmentalists. 
The environmental groups seek to protect potentially threatened animal species 
living almost exclusively in the region's valuable "old-growth" or virgin 
Douglas fir, redwood and spruce forests. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service -- in its most controversial study since 
delaying construction of Tennessee's Tellico Dam to protect the tiny snail 
darter fish in the late 1970s -- said in April that decades of habitat loss at 
the hands of the timber industry may qualify the northern spotted owl for 
protection under the Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hearings in Three States 
</P>
<P>
In August, the service is scheduled to conduct the first round of public 
hearings on whether to declare the northern spotted owl to be threatened with 
extinction. Hearings on the owl -- of which 3,000 to 4,500 are thought to exist 
-- will be held in all three affected states. 
</P>
<P>
Listing the mottled brown, medium-sized bird -- a subspecies related to similar 
raptors in Southern California, the southern Rocky Mountains and northern 
Mexico -- would require large habitat protection zones that could cut by half 
the volume of timber available for harvest from the federal forests in Oregon, 
Northern California and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Federal timber is vital to Pacific Northwest loggers for the rest of this 
century. Over-cutting of private timber lands to fuel the housing booms of the 
1950s and '60s has crimped private log supplies until replanted trees reach a 
harvestable size in another 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
Timber companies had planned to fill this so-called "log gap" with virgin 
publicly owned forests managed by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of 
Land Management. However, government forests are required by law to meet a 
variety of needs in addition to timber production, including recreation and 
wildlife protection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evidence of Threat 
</P>
<P>
Recent evidence that harvesting the most valuable parts of federal forests 
could threaten the northern spotted owl and other species with extinction has 
led to the current standoff between the industry and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials say restrictions on federal timber sales are to blame for a 
rash of sawmill closures and job losses throughout the Northwest -- an unusual 
development at a time of robust home construction and a particularly 
devastating blow to the heavily timber-dependent economies of southwestern 
Oregon and Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists counter that the closures and layoffs are a natural result of 
past over-harvesting of private forests, as well as the export of raw, unmilled 
logs to Asia and the computer automation of modern sawmills. 
</P>
<P>
This disagreement has led to bitter debates and rancorous demonstrations by 
both sides in big cities and small mill towns from San Francisco to Sweet Home, 
Ore. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of disagreement among the players in this drama is indicated by 
their respective projections of layoffs that will result from current legal 
restrictions on logging. The Northwest Forest Council, an industry group, says 
54,000 jobs will be lost in the coming year in Oregon alone; the U.S. Forest 
Service projects 11,000 Oregon layoffs; the state of Oregon itself anticipates 
5,300; environmentalists say that a few small market adjustments could avoid 
layoffs entirely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoiding Disaster 
</P>
<P>
The bird must by law be protected from the threat of extinction -- if it 
actually is so threatened, which has been theorized but not yet demonstrated -- 
but politicians on both sides of the issue are trying to find a way to do so 
without disastrous consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Push too far one way and they could cripple the timber industry as it works to 
compete with cheap Canadian imports and low-cost Southern supplies; push too 
far the other way and they could generate a backlash strong enough to gut the 
endangered species law. 
</P>
<P>
The Oregon politicians had hoped to find a way out of this dilemma by inviting 
the warring factions to sit down with one another and negotiate directly, 
rather than battle through lawyers in the courts. But an agreement was not 
produced. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, at the end of the eight-hour session, the two sides still could 
not agree on any of the fundamental facts: the number of owls remaining, the 
type of trees needed for them to survive or the reason for the apparent decline 
in their number. There was no agreement on how much old-growth timber exists, 
how quickly it is being cut, how important it is -- or even what constitutes 
"old growth." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the lack of agreement on those areas, environmentalists and loggers did 
both call for a revamp of federal timber regulations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Exports Issue 
</P>
<P>
Tom Giesen, president of the Oregon Natural Resources Council, suggested 
abandonment of the practice of cutting the oldest trees first on federal land, 
adoption of federal tax incentives to encourage more private timber growers and 
extending a ban on log exports from federal lands to include private lands for 
an emergency five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Raw-log exports rose sharply as the Japanese yen grew stronger against the 
dollar. The Japanese prefer to import raw logs rather than finished lumber 
because American mills until recently did not mill boards to metric sizes nor 
to the finish quality needed by Japan's open-beam architecture. The high prices 
paid by Japan have added to the log shortage now hurting Northwest mills. 
</P>
<P>
"We must stop log exports," Giesen said. "We cannot give Oregon's logs to 
subsidize Japanese jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Industry spokesman James Geisinger had different priorities for Congress. He 
recommended stripping courts of the ability to enforce strict compliance with 
environmental laws; mandating more production on federal land; setting up 
timber-production zones to make up for wilderness areas where logging is not 
allowed; and stopping federal forest-planning process -- and freezing in old 
high-volume timber cut levels -- until the spotted owl question is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
"Our industry cannot survive without an adequate land base dedicated to growing 
timber," Geisinger said. "We cannot eliminate the land base (to set aside land 
for wildlife) and assume it will be business as usual in our towns and 
communities and in our economy."

NUCLEAR TEST TALKS RESUME TODAY; 
</P>
<P>
U.S., SOVIETS SEEK TO RATIFY 2 ACCORDS, DISCUSS TOTAL BAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The longest-running U.S.-Soviet arms negotiations -- on limiting nuclear 
testing -- resume today in Geneva in an effort to get two decade-old agreements 
ratified and then to move toward a total test ban. 
</P>
<P>
The testing negotiations are separate from the strategic arms reduction talks, 
which resumed in Geneva last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Verification disagreements continue to hold up progress on the testing issue, 
however, with the United States appearing to drag its feet more than the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government, for example, has refused to make public the results of a 
joint U.S.-Soviet experiment in Nevada last September. On its face, the 
experiment proved that the intrusive on-site inspection system favored by the 
United States is less accurate than the off-site method favored by the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
"The information (on the experiment) was made available to the Soviets," an 
Energy Department spokesman said last week, "but it remains classified." Test 
ban supporters in Congress and elsewhere see this as additional proof that the 
Pentagon wants to keep the public uninformed to avoid pressure to change its 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Behind this posture is the Pentagon's conviction that -- as long as the nation 
relies on nuclear weapons to deter war -- some nuclear testing always will be 
required to insure reliability of the nuclear arsenal, to develop new warheads 
as weapons change and to maintain U.S. technological expertise. 
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department is even unhappy with the Reagan Administration's 
commitment at last year's U.S.-Soviet summit in Moscow to negotiate, once the 
old treaties are ratified, "further intermediate limitations on nuclear testing 
leading to the ultimate objective of the complete cessation of nuclear testing. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
In a review in preparation for resumption of the testing talks, the Pentagon 
sought to get the Bush Administration to back away from talks on "further 
intermediate limitations," according to sources. No decision has been made on 
the U.S. negotiating position, but a senior Administration official said he 
doubts that any significant change will be made within the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
Further limits of the type opposed by the Pentagon could include a cap on the 
annual number of underground tests, which are now unlimited, and reduction in 
the maximum size of such tests, now set at 150 kilotons, or equal to 150,000 
tons of TNT. 
</P>
<P>
But pressure on the Administration is coming from both international and 
domestic groups. 
</P>
<P>
Key nations that are capable of producing nuclear devices, led by India, are 
threatening to withdraw from the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty unless 
the superpowers make serious progress toward a total test ban. Under that 
treaty, to which more than 135 nations subscribe, nations with limited or no 
nuclear capabilities pledge not to make weapons in exchange for help on 
peaceful nuclear programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Bush Issues 
</P>
<P>
President Bush has made nonproliferation of ballistic missiles as well as 
nuclear and chemical weapons one of the major foreign policy issues of his 
Administration. The have-not nations apparently hope to hold the 
non-proliferation treaty hostage to progress toward further limits on weapons 
tests, an Administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic opponents of testing contend that, if testing is stopped, the United 
States will need less new highly enriched uranium and plutonium for weapons and 
could save some of the $5 billion needed to rebuild reactors and other 
facilities that produce those materials. 
</P>
<P>
Some Administration officials fear that congressional supporters of a total 
test ban may hold up funding for those facilities unless the Administration is 
more forthcoming in the negotiations, which are resuming after a seven-month 
break. 
</P>
<P>
The first superpower testing agreement, signed in 1963, banned tests in the 
air, sea and space. Only underground tests are permitted under the two treaties 
now pending. These are the Threshold Test Ban Treaty of 1974, which covers 
weapons tests, and the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty of 1976, which deals 
with nuclear devices used for such purposes as excavating canals and creating 
underground gas and oil reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
The Carter Administration did not submit the two treaties for ratification in 
the hope that a total test ban might be achieved. The Soviet invasion of 
Afghanistan ended that effort. And the Reagan Administration declared that it 
did not want a total ban and would not ask for congressional ratification of 
the two treaties until improved verification measures were worked out. 
</P>
<P>
This position produced a standoff for several years, with the Soviets promising 
to devise better monitoring measures only after the two treaties were ratified 
and insisting that any new negotiations aim at a total ban. 
</P>
<P>
But with the warming of relations under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, 
the two nations resumed discussions on the testing issue and eased their stands 
enough to produce the Moscow summit communique. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond compromising on the final goal of test ban talks, the summit reached 
agreement on two joint verification experiments, in which nuclear devices would 
be set off at each nation's test sites in the presence of inspectors from the 
other nation. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose was to resolve disagreement over the most accurate method of 
verifying the size of a test, to insure that it did not exceed the 150-kiloton 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
Of three ways to conduct such monitoring, the most accurate method -- 
radiochemical analysis of the soil near the explosion -- was rejected by both 
sides because it discloses too much secret information about how the weapon was 
constructed. The argument has been over the other two methods: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Seismic, in which the earthquake-like waves from a blast travel through the 
Earth to sensitive instruments that estimate its force. The Soviets favor this 
method, in large part because it can be done away from the test site, thus 
requiring little on-site inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hydrodynamic, in which an instrumented cable is lowered into the shaft 
containing the weapon (or into a parallel shaft). The rate at which the cable 
is crushed by the blast is a measure of the explosive power of the device. This 
method, called CORRTEX, is favored by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal calls for using CORRTEX to monitor all weapons tests above 50 
kilotons in size and all peaceful blasts above 35 kilotons. About 30 on-site 
inspectors would be needed to scrutinize details of the preparations, including 
the material used to fill in the shaft. The purpose would be to guard against 
"tamping," or masking, the shock waves from the explosion, which provides a 
measure of its true size.

MAINLAND'S TURBULENCE ELICITS AMBIVALENCE;

<P>
TAIWAN VIEW OF BEIJING: SHOCK BUT DETACHMENT 
</P>

TAIPEI, Taiwan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few days ago, while death sentences were being pronounced against 
pro-democracy protesters in China, stockbrokers in Taiwan popped champagne 
corks in celebration of a new market high. 
</P>
<P>
The coincidence of events reflected a crosscurrent of attitudes in Taiwan 
toward turbulent events on the mainland. Although the attack on Beijing's Tian 
An Men Square and its aftermath deeply shocked people here, there was also a 
sense of detachment. 
</P>
<P>
Students and common citizens, imbued with feelings of kinship and shared 
history with the mainland, donated blood and money for relief efforts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Great Effect 
</P>
<P>
But the problem was viewed as one that would not, after all, greatly effect 
Taiwan. Nor could Taiwan do much about the situation on the mainland. Talk on 
the street just as easily turns to the local preoccupation with air pollution 
as to the plight of Chinese dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
"For most of us, Tian An Men was a televised event. We watched and then went on 
with our business," said Zhan Hungzhi, a publisher and author. 
</P>
<P>
Commented one Western observer: "Taiwan looked across and saw this giant 
thrashing around and decided it was not worth getting too involved." 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan residents pointed out that this island is not like Hong Kong, which 
feels the mainland's breath getting closer -- the British colony is scheduled 
to revert to Chinese rule in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fiery Analogy 
</P>
<P>
People here feel confident that their lives will go on uninterrupted for the 
foreseeable future. "Hong Kong is like a tenant in a building that is on fire. 
It is screaming for help," said Edward Yang, a film maker. "Taiwan lives across 
the street. The fire is compelling, even upsetting, but does not necessarily 
effect the value of the property." 
</P>
<P>
The ambivalence of the general populace was shared by Taiwan's ruling 
Nationalist government that, being the political bastion of the late Chiang 
Kai-shek's Kuomintang organization, bills itself as the archrival and future 
successor of the Communist government in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when turmoil in China would send hearts aflutter here among 
Nationalist diehards who dream of taking back the mainland from which they were 
driven 40 years ago. And a few old-timers did insist that now was the time for 
the Nationalists to go home. 
</P>
<P>
However, news of trouble in Beijing mostly brought out expressions of timidity 
rather than predictions of impending triumph. 
</P>
<P>
Although the government found its incessant anti-Communist propaganda 
chillingly confirmed by the attack on Tian An Men Square, it was not eager to 
crow about the troubles on the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
Officials appeared to be ill at ease with Taiwan's being brought into the 
picture at all. Word last week that China was blaming 13 alleged spies in the 
service of Taiwan for inciting "counterrevolutionary riots" only increased 
their anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
"Our worst fear is that we be used as a scapegoat. That is why we restrain 
ourselves," said government spokesman Shaw Yuming. 
</P>
<P>
"We specifically avoided making propaganda points," added Liu Polung, who heads 
the North American Department of Taiwan's Foreign Ministry. "All in all it is a 
time for caution." 
</P>
<P>
The muted response may also be due to the government's own record of putting 
down demonstrations and popular movements, Chinese and foreign observers say. 
Martial law was in place here for 38 years and was lifted only two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hypocrisy Seen 
</P>
<P>
"There was some hypocrisy in the government's clucking over Tian An Men," a 
representative of a Western country said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the killings in Beijing, Taiwan's government itself mounted 
demonstrations, keeping them carefully under control lest they turn into local 
pleas for greater democracy or for outright independence from China. 
</P>
<P>
After the massacre, officials here took 48 hours to fully react and Chinese 
commentators said that the government was doing too little to support 
dissidence in China. 
</P>
<P>
The government responded by sending up some balloons to carry newspapers into 
China and by expanding radio broadcasts beamed at the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
Most wallposters mourning the dead in Beijing are now gone from Taipei's 
university campuses. The president of state-run Taipei University ordered a 
display of posters removed from the school's front gate, saying that it was 
unsightly. The banners included some commentary against the Taiwan government. 
</P>
<P>
No one is saying that the turbulence in China has brought the day closer when 
Taiwan will be reunified with its giant and impoverished cousin across the 
Formosa Strait. On the contrary, a recent warming trend in relations between 
Beijing and Taipei appears to be in unofficial suspension. 
</P>
<P>
The government had authorized travel to China for non-government tourists and 
in May sent an official representative to the Asian Development Bank meeting 
held in Beijing. For several years, Taiwan had looked the other way as its 
businessmen traded with and even invested in China. 
</P>
<P>
"As we liberalize, there was an illusion that things would get better quickly," 
said Liu from the Foreign Ministry. "Perhaps now we will all have a more sober 
view." 
</P>
<P>
The government had recently floated an idea to ease tensions with China: a 
so-called one country-two governments policy that would put the Nationalists, 
who control only Taiwan and a few small nearby islands, on a par with the 
Communists in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal was modeled on such split-nationhoods as East and West Germany and 
North and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
This idea, too, appears to be a victim of the Tian An Men massacre. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. Taiwan seems to have grown accustomed to -- even to have embraced -- 
its strange status as a country fully recognized by only 15 other nations, 
including such exotic addresses as South Africa, El Salvador and Haiti. The 
rest of the world either ignores the island or, like the United States and 
Japan, maintains relations through private front organizations manned by 
diplomats on leave. 
</P>
<P>
Taiwan lost all this diplomatic status in the 1970s when erstwhile friends 
rushed to open relations with China, which was beginning to emerge from the 
shadows of the Cultural Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the island has prospered mightily, joining Hong Kong, Singapore and 
South Korea on the list of "little dragons" that have followed Japan, the Big 
Dragon, in building impressive economies. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, Taipei was a sleepy provincial capital. It has now taken on 
the trappings of a regional powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
A new theater and a new concert hall have been done in the manner of Qing 
Dynasty palaces, down to the gold-tiled roofs and giant red pillars. A new 
railroad station is also being built along the same lines. Glass-encased office 
buildings are all the rage as well. Traffic is a world-class mess. 
</P>
<P>
So confident are Taiwan residents of their economic future that some experts 
see gain even from the crisis in China. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my opinion that the impact will be favorable. Business people may 
transfer purchases and even investment to Taiwan from China," said Chao 
Kangyang, who heads the Chinese Economic Institute, a private think tank in 
Taipei. 
</P>
<P>
Chao considers that flight capital from Hong Kong may have fueled the recent 
binge on Taiwan's stock market. 
</P>
<P>
The willingness of Taiwan to brush aside the mainland crisis suggests to some 
that emotional ties with the mainland may be loosening. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Yang, a writer whose works have at one time or another been banned in both 
China and Taiwan, noted that many citizens here have visited China and see that 
there are grave practical differences that will keep the people apart for many 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"The failure of democracy on the mainland is yet another obstacle. Until Tian 
An Men, perhaps we who live in Taiwan could think of reunification," Bo said. 
"Now it is more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Economist Chao, who was born in China, is planning to make a trip there soon to 
transfer the ashes of his in-laws from the path of a new highway being built 
near his old hometown in northeastern China. 
</P>
<P>
Would he like to return to spend his future retirement there? 
</P>
<P>
"I have a house in San Luis Obispo," Chao said. "That is where I would like to 
live."

Japanese Foreign Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka left Sunday for meetings with 
President Bush and U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III in Washington to 
discuss Japan's response to China's bloody crackdown on dissidents and 
U.S.-Japanese trade friction. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsuzuka, a former trade minister who became foreign minister in the new 
Cabinet formed June 2, will meet with Bush, Baker, U.S. Trade Representative 
Carla Anderson Hills, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, Defense Secretary 
Dick Cheney and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.). 
</P>
<P>
Mitsuzuka said before leaving Japan that he will not be pressured into imposing 
economic sanctions against China. Japan has called the crackdown by the Chinese 
government "regrettable" but has said it is "essentially an internal affair."

TWO BUILDINGS RAMMED BY TRUCK

A pickup truck rammed through the double glass doors of the Chinese Consulate 
in the 500 block of South Shatto Place on Sunday night, Los Angeles police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
About 15 minutes later in Chinatown, a similar make truck smashed through the 
Bank of America branch office at Broadway and College Street. 
</P>
<P>
Rampart Division Sgt. Tom Knopp said officers called in a report of the 9:45 
p.m. incident at the consulate, but details were sketchy. 
</P>
<P>
The impact apparently shattered the doors, but did no further damage. The 
pickup was seen speeding from the scene. 
</P>
<P>
In Chinatown, after entering the bank on Broadway, the truck slammed into a 
counter, shattered a surveillance camera, knocked over several potted plants, 
and left tire scratch marks along the length of the floor, Central Division 
Sgt. Ed Wheelis said. 
</P>
<P>
The truck finally exited the building through glass doors on College Street, 
the opposite side from where it entered, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses described the bank intruder's truck as a white, late model Ford 
pickup truck, Wheelis said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the driver "left in a hurry," and that the bank vault and the cash 
boxes were not tampered with. 
</P>
<P>
The driver was being sought for investigation of vandalism.

An air ambulance carrying five people crashed moments after takeoff from Pelee 
Island in Lake Erie, killing at least two people, and U.S. and Canadian divers 
searched Sunday for the missing pilot. 
</P>
<P>
Search boats rescued a man and a woman shortly after the plane crashed about 
200 yards west of the Canadian island late Saturday, said Constable Wayne 
O'Brien of the Ontario Provincial Police. All those aboard were from Canada.

LAWYER'S DAUGHTER, 13, DIES OF INJURIES FROM PLANE CRASH THAT KILLED 3 OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 13-year-old Northridge girl died Sunday from head injuries suffered in a 
plane crash that claimed the lives of three other family members. 
</P>
<P>
Lorraine Rhoden, who had been on life-support systems since Thursday's crash in 
Santa Clarita, died about 2:30 a.m. at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in 
Valencia, nursing supervisor Anne Coleman said. The girl's father, prominent 
Los Angeles attorney Harold Rhoden, 66; her mother, Sheila, 40; and 
grandmother, Ceil Rauch, 61, of Lake Worth, Fla., were killed instantly in the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Rhoden, who recently won a jury's landmark $21-million award for Marc 
Christian against the estate of actor Rock Hudson that was later reduced by a 
judge, was piloting the single-engine plane at the time of the crash, 
authorities said. The plane was en route from Sacramento to Van Nuys Airport 
when it developed engine trouble and crashed about 2 p.m. in a ravine near 
Sierra Highway and Placerita Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation 
Administration are investigating the cause of the accident.

200,000 CHEER ON GAY PRIDE PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH J. MANN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A crowd of more than 200,000 cheered the 19th annual Gay and Lesbian Pride 
Parade in West Hollywood on Sunday, pausing to release balloons in memory of 
AIDS victims and mark the 20th anniversary of the riot that spawned the 
homosexual rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
Throngs of people whooped it up, dancing and singing as the parade passed. The 
parade wound along Santa Monica Boulevard after kicking off with the release of 
several thousand pink balloons, inscribed with the words "I Love You," to 
remember those who have died from acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
For Morris Kight, a director emeritus of Christopher Street West and a veteran 
of the gay rights movement, the weekend celebration could not have been more 
perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking over the last 20 years with pride," said Kight, who helped 
organize Los Angeles' first gay pride parade, which was held in Hollywood in 
1970. "When this generation started, it was not gay to be gay. We are 
celebrating 20 years of action. I find it stunning." The theme of the 
celebration, which capped a two-day street festival, was "Stonewall 20: A 
Generation of Pride." The festival marked the 20th anniversary of the 1969 
rebellion at the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar on Christopher Street in New York. 
The event is regarded in the homosexual community as the turning point in the 
modern gay and lesbian rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great day, I feel good I am still here," said Paul Duncan, who 
is currently undergoing treatment for AIDS. "To me, the parade is a celebration 
of pride, a day I don't have to worry about AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
Veteran CARES, a group of gay veterans representing all branches of the 
military, led 257 floats and contingents in the pageant. The parade was 
sponsored by Christopher Street West/Los Angeles, a nonprofit group that 
provides grants to the gay and lesbian community. 
</P>
<P>
The 10,000 marchers, ranging from the elegant to the extraordinary, waved and 
shouted to those who jammed the sidewalks. Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los 
Angeles), the parade's grand marshal, and Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley 
received warm ovations as they rode in vintage Cadillacs. 
</P>
<P>
A character called "Kaptain Condom," dressed in a red, white and blue superhero 
suit, also was cheered as he cruised by the grandstand on an old military tank 
decorated with balloons and streamers. Not far behind were the West Hollywood 
High Cheerleaders, a group of female impersonators sporting pompons, false 
breasts, wigs and mustaches. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our day to be free," said Steve Pounds, 29, who has been attending the 
parade with his mother for 10 years. "It is about time we can be ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Pounds' mother, JoAnne Wright, was equally enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called a Positive Thing 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe gays belong pushed in the closet," Wright said. "The parade is 
a very positive thing -- I think more parents should support their children." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone at the parade shared that view. 
</P>
<P>
A knot of Christian fundamentalist protesters, largely ignored by the crowd, 
stood to one side. "Shame on you for what you do," they chanted. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of marchers paraded in other major cities. In San 
Francisco, Mayor Art Agnos, along with Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Barbara Boxer, 
both Democrats from California -- rode floats alongside AIDS workers and 
victims as that parade moved through the Castro district, the city's gay area. 
</P>
<P>
And in New York City, home of the Stonewall Inn, the parade down 5th Avenue 
featured colorful floats, drum and bugle corps and costumes. 
</P>
<P>
A minimum of incidents of violence was reported along the route.

EVIDENCE OF FRAUD RAISES FEARS THAT PRI IS GEARING UP FOR RIGGED VICTORY

<P>
The alchemists of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party have been 
mixing their potions, it is said, along the deep-rutted streets of the 
squatter's community known as Camino Verde. 
</P>
<P>
The product of these latter-day conjurers, critics say, is not gold yielded 
from lead, but rather the raw material of which elections are made: votes. 
</P>
<P>
They have been successful to the extent of inflating the voting rolls in Camino 
Verde -- a pro ruling-party stronghold -- by more than threefold, opposition 
leaders charge. And that's just in one neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We've found that the fraud has been massive and crude," said Cecilia Barone de 
Castellanos, campaign coordinator in Tijuana for the opposition National Action 
Party, as she brandished pages of allegedly phony voter registration 
credentials from Camino Verde. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Casting a Spell 
</P>
<P>
It's election time in Mexico, and the nation's peculiar electoral alquimia -- 
alchemy, as electoral fraud is not-so-fondly known here -- appears to be 
casting as mesmerizing a spell as ever. 
</P>
<P>
With the campaign for Sunday's elections drawing to a close -- up for grabs are 
the Baja California governor's seat, four municipal governments and 15 state 
legislative slots -- allegations of voting misdeeds have begun to dominate 
headlines here. The election has attracted international attention, as Mexico's 
ruling party, known by its Spanish acronym as the PRI, faces the possibility of 
losing control of a governor's seat for the first time in history. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Baja California, official figures show that the total number of 
registered voters has risen by more than 10% in the past four months -- a 
proportionately huge increase that opposition leaders say is evidence of 
tampering. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the muckraking weekly Zeta published allegations that even the 
departed have been called on to vote in Ensenada. The newspaper published a 
copy of the death certificate of one registered voter, Jose Sanchez Meza, who 
passed away on Jan. 6, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Miracles of the Electoral Commission," read the headline. "The dead are 
revived and will vote." 
</P>
<P>
Such charges are as much a part of the electoral fabric of Mexico these days as 
blaring loudspeakers, mass rallies and giveaways of food and other amenities. 
Just last week, the opposition National Action Party said that it found 15,000 
ballots already marked in favor of the PRI in the bathroom of a government 
printing office in northern Chihuahua state, where hotly contested elections 
are also slated for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fraud Part of Process 
</P>
<P>
While fraud has been part of the Mexican electoral fabric for decades, the 
growing strength of Mexico's opposition parties has focused increased attention 
on the phenomenon. Also, opposition leaders have had additional resources to 
document the problem. 
</P>
<P>
This year's allegations, complete with apparently substantive evidence of clear 
irregularities, observers say, tend to undermine claims by Mexico's President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who took office Dec. 1, that he is committed to 
electoral reform and a true democratic opening. Opponents maintain that Salinas 
himself owes his position to a rigged vote last summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexico City can bemoan (fraud) and denounce it, but its continued presence 
illustrates the continuing problem of control over what the party does at the 
state and local levels," said Wayne A. Cornelius, director of the Center for 
U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San Diego. "It's going to be very difficult to 
police the actions of PRI apparatchiks and government types at local levels to 
prevent the usual shenanigans from going on again." 
</P>
<P>
As always, the chief target of such allegations is the all-pervasive ruling 
party, the PRI, which has dominated Mexican politics for six decades. Since its 
founding in 1929, the PRI has never lost the presidency or a single governor's 
seat. Until last July's elections, in which President Salinas of the PRI won a 
narrow and much-disputed victory over a popular opposition leader, PRI 
presidential candidates routinely commanded 75% of the vote or more -- almost 
unheard-of majorities in true multi-party systems. 
</P>
<P>
"The PRI always wins, doesn't it?" is a frequent response in Mexico to 
inquiries about prospective election results. 
</P>
<P>
Although PRI officials say their hands are clean, few independent observers 
dispute the fact that fraud on a scale unimagined by even the late Chicago 
Mayor Richard Daley has been an integral part of the system in Mexican 
politics. Traditionally, observers say, PRI leaders have resorted to fakery 
even when they didn't have to, eager as they were to amass the largest 
majorities possible in their districts, the better to curry favor with party 
leaders. It was a way of climbing the PRI success ladder. 
</P>
<P>
In what many analysts consider a hopeful sign, the PRI mayor of the northern 
Mexican city of Hermosillo, Mexico, recently resigned from office after being 
charged with electoral fraud. Experts gathered at a conference on U.S-Mexico 
relations in San Diego last week said they could recall no similar case. 
</P>
<P>
But, among opposition politicians, hope for a true political opening is dimming 
with every new allegation of fraud by PRI loyalists. 
</P>
<P>
"We are constantly frustrated by fraud and other electoral chicanery," charged 
Diego Fernandez Cevallos, a member of the national committee of the National 
Action Party (PAN) during the San Diego conference last week. PAN officials 
have alleged that their candidates have been robbed in rigged elections in 
recent years throughout the nation, notably in the northern border states of 
Chihuahua and Sonora. They fear the same in Baja. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charge of Sour Grapes 
</P>
<P>
In the view of PRI leaders, such allegations amount to sour grapes on the part 
of opposition leaders unable to mount successful campaigns. While PAN activists 
charge the ruling party with creating a "culture of fraud," PRI officials 
respond that the allegation is simply something to fall back on with every new 
defeat at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
"National Action tries to cultivate this image of electoral fraud being 
everywhere," said Bernardo Sanchez Rios, a federal senator from Tijuana who is 
the president of the city's PRI committee. "They want to cover up for their 
losses. That's what this is about." 
</P>
<P>
But charges of fraud emanate from most every opposition party, not just the 
PAN. Leaders of the reformist Party of the Democratic Revolution, which is also 
contesting the elections in Baja California, joined in denouncing the alleged 
deception in Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see where the PRI is respecting the integrity of this election," 
Martha Maldonado, the party's gubernatorial election, said in an interview 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Camino Verde, a Tijuana neighborhood long regarded as a 
veritable PRI fiefdom often independent of municipal control, opposition 
parties have reported that voter registration rolls mushroomed from 8,769 to 
29,741 -- more than tripling -- during April, the cutoff month for 
registration. (Residents must be 18 to vote in Mexico; before registering, they 
must present authorities with evidence of their identity and residence. Some 
weeks later, they receive their official voting credentials; their fingerprints 
are kept on file.) 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, the newly registered voters of Camino Verde would cast their 
ballots for PRI candidates. The names of relatives of a number of community 
party leaders were listed multiple times, according to examinations of official 
records by opponents and the press. 
</P>
<P>
There were also some more singular names. Among those registered to vote: Pablo 
Picasso and Juan Sebastian Bach. 
</P>
<P>
When National Action officials attempted to verify matters in the streets of 
Camino Verde earlier this month, they maintain that they were obstructed by 
thugs who broke vehicle windows and punctured tires. They left. 
</P>
<P>
Officials such as the PRI's Sanchez describe such vote-registration 
irregularities as "human" mistakes that are being rectified, and will not 
affect the voting tally. They point out that the the State Election Commission, 
which oversees the voting process, is an independent body. Commission 
officials, whose independence has been questioned by the opposition, have 
denied there is any evidence of wrongdoing in Baja. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Questioned Sharp Rise 
</P>
<P>
Opposition leaders have questioned the recent sharp rise in the voting rolls in 
Baja California -- the numbers grew by some 82,000 in the past four months, 
with the total now topping 900,000 eligible voters. Between 1986 and 1988, the 
latter a presidential election year, the number of eligible voters rose by 
fewer than 575. 
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Ruffo Appel, Baja gubernatorial candidate of the opposition PAN, 
attributed the increase in an interview principally to a rise in fraudulent 
registrations by the ruling PRI. 
</P>
<P>
But Arturo Guerra Flores, general secretary of government for Baja California, 
traced the big hike to a series of less sinister factors, including voter 
registration campaigns by various parties and heightened interest in the 
elections. "There has been absolutely no fraud," Guerra declared during an 
interview Saturday at his office in Mexicali. Guerra, who twice served as state 
president of the ruling PRI, presides over the state administration of the 
voting. 
</P>
<P>
The opposition has filed a criminal complaint in connection with the Camino 
Verde case, and is calling for a complete sanitizing of the voting rolls -- 
although it is unclear how that could be accomplished before election day. PAN 
officials have even raised the possibility of withdrawing their candidates from 
the elections. But that would be a drastic step -- and potentially 
counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from inflating vote totals, the electoral fraud could have another 
impact: Higher abstention. Political apathy has led growing numbers of Mexican 
voters to abandon the polls on election day; some fear that renewed reports of 
"alchemy" could accelerate the trend, even in heated contests such as those in 
Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people will say, 'Why vote? It's not worth it,' " noted J. Jesus 
Blancornelas, editor of the weekly Zeta. 
</P>
<P>
But, at a voting registration office in the Colonia Libertad last week, 
business was brisk. Among those picking up credentials was Jose Luis Ortega, 
20, who said he was going to cast his first ballot ever. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm voting for the PRI," Ortega told a reporter afterward. "They always win, 
don't they?" 
</P>

IMPERIAL BEACH HAS LONG HELD CROWN AMONG HAPLESS CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H. G. REZA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite its regal name, Imperial Beach has known more than its share of 
unceremonious moments. For much of the past decade, Imperial Beach has stood by 
helplessly, watching its incorporated throne dissolve. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning with the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, the seaside city that 
bills itself at the Most Southwesterly City in the Continental U. S. has 
survived most emergencies, from occasional spills of raw Tijuana sewage that 
literally piles up on its doorstep to the dissolution of its police force and 
the indictment of its city treasurer for stealing from its coffers. 
</P>
<P>
But earlier this year, the City Council was confronted with a realization that 
shocked even most citizens who thought they had seen and confronted everything 
that could ever afflict Imperial Beach. City Manager Ron Jack informed the 
council that the city was flat broke and needed to come up with almost $800,000 
in revenues by the start of the new fiscal year July 1. That, or the city might 
be forced to disincorporate. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, Imperial Beach became Imperiled Beach. 
</P>
<P>
At a noisy town hall meeting last week attended by about 300 people, city 
leaders attempted to explain the seriousness of the situation. Some of the 
options discussed included annexations by the county and San Diego, but they 
curried little favor with the audience, which demanded to know how the city's 
financial situation had gotten so bad. 
</P>
<P>
One speaker, noting that Imperial Beach seems to always be indebted to someone, 
compared the tiny beachfront community to a Third World country. Indeed, since 
its incorporation in 1956, Imperial Beach, with a population of about 24,000, 
seems to have spent much of its cityhood teetering on the precipice. 
</P>
<P>
With virtually no industry, the city is almost wholly a residential community 
that must rely on property taxes for most of its revenue. Property tax rates 
for Imperial Beach are already among the highest in the county. But even if the 
city could attract industry, Mayor Henry Smith noted in a recent interview that 
"we don't have any place to put it." 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that there is very little space left on which to build in Imperial 
Beach. According to Smith, half the city's 4.4 square miles is made up of 
greenbelts and a wildlife estuary. Smith, a plain-speaking, self-proclaimed 
"cracker," finds himself in the unenviable position of possibly having to 
preside over the dissolution of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Beach, it seems, has always been plagued by a heavy dose of bad karma. 
The city's beginnings were tenuous at best, but not without humor. Perhaps as 
testament to its modest surroundings of homes and people, Imperial Beach was 
founded for a simple purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"We were initially founded to accommodate tourists from the Imperial Valley, 
who came to the beach to escape the summer heat. . . . They would pitch tents 
on the beach during the summer. At the beginning, the only people who came to 
Imperial Beach were farmers from the Imperial Valley," Smith chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he said, unless you live in Imperial Beach, there isn't much reason to 
come here. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grinning and Gritting 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the years, Imperialists have learned to grin and bear it. And, 
because of the city's proximity to the Mexican border -- just 5 miles south -- 
local residents have also learned to grit their teeth. Until recently, sewage 
spills were as common in Tijuana as the pounding of the ocean on Imperial 
Beach's pier, the town's only landmark. 
</P>
<P>
When the spills occurred, millions of gallons of raw sewage would flow down the 
fetid Tijuana River to the Pacific Ocean, where it would wind up on Imperial 
Beach's 19,000 feet of beach. 
</P>
<P>
"The sewage always stopped at our city limits," Smith said. "The other side of 
the city limits, to the north, it was clean. Coronado was always clean . . . . 
It was the damnedest thing." 
</P>
<P>
The spills made Imperial Beach the butt of numerous jokes, and some people 
suggested that the city's motto should be changed to "Where the sewage meets 
the surf." 
</P>
<P>
However, the city's financial problems have never been a laughing matter. When 
Proposition 13 was passed by state voters in June, 1978, Imperial Beach was the 
envy of most San Diego County cities. While they were laying off employees to 
comply with the newly mandated tax cuts, Imperial Beach -- with its high 
property tax base and small public work force -- was able to give its employees 
raises of between 5.5% and 6.5%, and proudly announced that it had more than 
$500,000 in reserves. 
</P>
<P>
But beginning in 1981, the half a million dollars in surplus was persistently 
whittled away until it disappeared four years later. By City Manager Jack's own 
admission, Imperial Beach today can't even afford to fill a pothole. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pilfering From Parking Meters 
</P>
<P>
But back in 1978, City Treasurer George Ramos liked to show reporters his $8 
desk and boasted that he ran Imperial Beach "like a cheap household." Five 
years later, when the city began showing signs of financial instability, Ramos 
was convicted of taking $2,000 in meter money and padding his sick-leave 
compensation by $1,200. He was forced to resign. 
</P>
<P>
While Ramos was pilfering from the parking meters, the City Council was voting 
to dismantle the 14-member Police Department as a cost-saving measure, and 
voting to instead contract with the county Sheriff's Department for police 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Five years after the entire department was fired, Imperial Beach was still 
paying thousands of dollars in damages to people arrested by Imperial Beach 
cops. 
</P>
<P>
"We had about 40% bad arrests," Smith said. "That's tremendously high." 
</P>
<P>
The city's Fire Department was trimmed to nine firefighters, working three 
shifts of three people each. As a cost-saving measure, Jack recently looked 
into the possibility of reducing each shift to two firefighters, until he was 
told it would take at least three people to battle a fire. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986 and '87, city administrators attempted to right their listing ship 
through the stock market. But, like most of Imperial Beach's dreams, that 
quickly turned into a nightmare that promises to worsen before it gets better. 
Hoping to make a quick killing and fatten the city's coffers, the previous city 
manager, city attorney and planner invested about $300,000 of the city's money 
in stocks. The move quickly went sour. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hefty Legal Fees 
</P>
<P>
The three officials were subsequently fired and sued by the city, which also 
filed a $2.5-million suit against the E. F. Hutton firm, the successor to 
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., which handled Imperial Beach's investment. 
Attorneys representing the city in the matter presented the council with a 
legal bill of about $200,000 last year, Smith said. And considering the slow 
and tortuous path that civil suits take in Superior Court, the city's legal 
fees are certain to mount. 
</P>
<P>
At last week's town hall meeting, Jack told the audience that the attorneys 
have predicted they will be able to recover a sizable amount of the lost 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
Jack's comment raised the ire of one resident who shouted that "Imperial Beach 
is always willing to listen to the first used-car salesman who comes to 
Imperial Beach!" 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago, "experts" convinced the City Council to build a $3-million 
pier to replace the one destroyed by a winter storm. The city, whose annual 
budget amounted to about $4 million, took on the added expenditure, Smith said, 
because the pier was seen as Imperial Beach's economic salvation. 
</P>
<P>
"You ask, 'Why would anybody want to come to Imperial Beach?' Without the pier, 
there was no reason to come to Imperial Beach . . . . The pier was important to 
us because we hoped it would attract other commercial businesses and provide 
new revenue for us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The economic boon promised by the pier never materialized. Smith claimed that 
several developers have expressed an interest in building beachfront hotels in 
Imperial Beach, but the beach remains undeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists Blamed 
</P>
<P>
The mayor blames much of Imperial Beach's economic problems on 
environmentalists who have successfully opposed a redevelopment agency for the 
city and plans to promote commercial building in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of environmentalists in this town, and they've been very 
successful . . . . They've voted down a redevelopment agency three times and 
succeeded in recalling one mayor who supported redevelopment . . . . You can be 
very popular if you say you're not going to promote any building in this town 
and let the beach remain as it is," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Smith predicted that Imperial Beach might be able "to hang in for one more 
year" before it will be forced to disincorporate. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the council is hoping that the San Diego Unified Port District will 
come to Imperial Beach's aid. The city has proposed leasing its entire 
beachfront to the district, with the idea that the it will develop the area and 
provide a new source of revenue for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Smith envisions the Port District putting in a new marina, tourist attractions, 
hotels and restaurants around the pier. However, the city is still negotiating 
the idea with port commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city is a charter member of the Port District, it is the only one 
that has not profited from the association. 
</P>
<P>
"Our best bet for survival as a city is the Port District," Smith said. "The 
citizens won't stand for us raising property taxes or creating new assessment 
districts . . . . But we've never derived a penny from the port. We have some 
chits to cash in, and now is the time to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his own poor health and the prospect of having to resuscitate a city 
that is already gasping for breath, Smith remains upbeat about Imperial Beach's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a tough year. Being mayor of this small town has turned out to be a 
tough job," he said. "But I'm a tough old bastard. Neither the city nor I will 
go without a fight."

2 OFFICIALS' FIRINGS NOT LINKED TO FUND LOSS 
</P>
<P>
In a June 26 story about Imperial Beach, The Times reported that a former city 
attorney and city planner were fired and sued by the city for their involvement 
in an investment plan that resulted in a $300,000 loss. Former City Atty. 
Clifton E. Reed and former Planner James D. Sandoval were fired in February, 
1987, and have sued the city for wrongful termination. City representatives 
have said that neither man's termination was related to the bad investment, nor 
have the two men been named as defendants in any lawsuits concerning the 
matter. Both Sandoval and Reed say that they had no involvement in the 
transactions that led to the losses.

NEW ROAD, MORE TRAFFIC MAY END POWAY ENCLAVE'S TRANQUILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RAY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's in a name? Ask 19 Poway families and they will tell you that a name has 
robbed them of their peace of mind, their lifetime investment in 
half-million-dollar homes and their faith in city government. 
</P>
<P>
All of them bought lots along Gate Drive and built custom homes in a quiet 
little valley about a mile from downtown Poway. 
</P>
<P>
A few may have wondered at the oversized width of Gate Drive as it wound down 
to the cluster of estate homes, then ended abruptly at a barricade. But until a 
year ago, no one realized that the meandering street would soon become an 
arterial -- Midland Road -- linking a massive industrial park now in the 
building stages to the booming city of Poway. 
</P>
<P>
Now the 50 or so residents of Los Lomas Estates must face the prospect of 
10,000 to 12,000 cars a day going past their quiet hideaway homes where now the 
howl of a coyote is more common than the hum of tires. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Boysel, president of the Los Lomas Homeowners Assn., admits that when he 
moved in a year and a half ago, he was informed that Gate Drive "would be no 
more" at sometime in the future and that the road which now dead-ends at Los 
Lomas would be extended southward as Midland Drive. 
</P>
<P>
But continuation of the meandering road past his home held no threat for him. 
The creation of a four-lane connector road between the area's two major 
east-west highways was another matter. 
</P>
<P>
Boysel estimates that about 200 cars now use Gate Drive daily, and predicts 
that number "will be cut in half" when construction workers building the final 
homes in the upscale subdivision pack up their pickups and leave. 
</P>
<P>
Now all the Los Lomas residents know the bad news that their driveways will 
open into a busy street connecting the 2,000-acre South Poway Industrial Park 
to Poway Road. 
</P>
<P>
"There is vacant land all around us," Boysel said. "We are hoping that the city 
will reroute Midland Road around us. It would probably mean more grading, more 
fill, more expense but it would save our rural life style and our homes, 
probably the biggest expenditure we will make during our lifetimes." 
</P>
<P>
What can 50 residents do against the city government and the will of more than 
42,000 Poway residents? Poway needs more roads and more jobs. The South Poway 
industrial park offers both. 
</P>
<P>
Boysel said the group has contacted city officials, spoken one-on-one with 
Poway City Council members, attended council sessions and traffic planning 
meetings and tried to get the word of their plight out to the people who have 
the power to resolve it. 
</P>
<P>
Faith Mohling, the 76-year-old building contractor who bought the property in 
1970, sold the Los Lomas acreages to the present owners and built her own home 
and a number of others there over the past 3 1/2 years, remembers when the 
realization of the Midland Road impact hit her new neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very angry. At me," she said. "They thought that I had deceived them 
and that I knew about it." 
</P>
<P>
Mohling said that despite the fact that she had been building projects in Poway 
since 1967 and had served for six years on a city-county planning group before 
the city incorporated in 1980, she had no inkling of the fate of Los Lomas. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Blob on the Map' 
</P>
<P>
The industrial park was "just a blob on the map," impossible to locate exactly 
because it had no identifying landmarks, only future building sites. She knew 
that Gate Drive would be extended south, she said, but had no idea that it 
would become a major access road to the industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
"People here are devastated about the road," she said. She has joined with 
other Los Lomas residents in their efforts to detour the route into an 
unpopulated area. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Los Lomas residents have reached out to other nearby 
neighborhoods affected by the future Midland Road, informing them of the city's 
plans and handing out bumper stickers proclaiming: "Say No to Midland Road 
Extension." 
</P>
<P>
Signs with the same slogan puzzled Poway drivers when they were posted by the 
road opponents along busy Poway thoroughfares. City officials ordered them 
taken down. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't take down other people's signs. Just ours," complained Bea Reuel. 
"I don't think it's fair." Reuel said that the Audubon Society has been 
recruited to aid in the anti-road campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Bird watchers have identified several dozen species of feathered residents near 
the community, including a black-footed gnat-catcher which is on the 
"threatened species" list. That's not as good a roadblock as the endangered 
least Bell's vireo or least tern, she admits, but the gnat-catcher was key in 
preserving Blue Sky Ranch near Lake Poway from development and might turn the 
trick for Los Lomas Estates. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Bowersox, Poway city manager, defends the city's stance and methods as 
proper, but admits that the "unsuspecting buyers" in Los Lomas have legitimate 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The South Poway Planned Community (the industrial area) was proposed and 
planned before Los Lomas residents moved in. The Midland Road extension to join 
with the South Poway Parkway -- a major east-west arterial serving the 
industrial park and linking with Interstate 15 -- was in the specific plans for 
the area adopted by the City Council in 1985, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It is a four-lane undivided roadway for which developer Mohling dedicated the 
necessary right-of-way through Los Lomas, he said. It is planned as a major 
artery to Poway Road from the park and is now under study for possible revision 
or deletion. 
</P>
<P>
"If the study shows we don't need the road, we won't build the road," Bowersox 
said. "The city is not in the business of spending money on things that are not 
needed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shrinking Road or Rerouting 
</P>
<P>
Other possible alternatives are scaling Midland Road extension down to a 
two-lane size or rerouting it to the east or west of Los Lomas Estates, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, with the city's recommendation, will be presented to the homeowners' 
group before Friday and will probably be up for a City Council decision in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Jan Goldsmith has wrestled with the Midland Road extension both as a 
council member and as chairman of the city's transportation task force. He has 
heard all the arguments and has come out for deletion of the road if the 
traffic study, now in the hands of outside consultants, indicates that deletion 
is possible. 
</P>
<P>
South Poway Parkway is meant as a major future road linking California 67 to 
Interstate 15, he explained, and should have as few cross streets as possible 
because intersections reduce road capacity and slow traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith sees South Poway Parkway as an alternative that will ease traffic on 
Poway Road, now heavily congested with local traffic and with inland commuters 
headed for I-15 and San Diego. In the future, it will link with California 125, 
which starts at the border on Otay Mesa and swings through the Santee-Lakeside 
area before heading north to Poway and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Lomas residents fear that the road will go through eventually, if not 
by 1992 as planned. They would like to see Midland Road built someplace else so 
that in the future the bulldozers don't come over the hill and start creating a 
roadbed where Gate Drive ends. 
</P>
<P>
Also discouraging as they await the city's decision is the offhand remark of a 
city staffer that "it's 98% sure" the road will stay just where it is.

IN BRIEF: NUTS MAY AVERT HEART DISEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From staff and wire reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A handful of nuts a day may keep heart attack away, according to a group of 
researchers at Loma Linda University. A six-year study of diet and fatal 
coronary heart disease among 34,000 California members of the Seventh-day 
Adventist Church found that nuts were the only food item listed with a 
statistically significant protection against heart-attack death. 
</P>
<P>
"Compared to a person who never ate nuts, a person who ate them at least once a 
day had only 47% of the risk" of fatal heart attack, said Dr. Gary E. Fraser, 
co-author of a study presented last week at the Second International Conference 
of Preventive Cardiology in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser said the data was collected through questionnaires mailed between 1976 
and 1982. In a follow-up study, the researchers found that there had been 260 
fatal heart attacks among those surveyed earlier. The scientists then compared 
answers on the dietary questionnaires to determine what foods, if any, tended 
to suggest protection against heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser said nuts appeared to be the major common food that protected against 
heart disease. Peanuts were the most commonly consumed nut -- chosen by about 
60% of those questioned. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser said it is not now known what in nuts can provide protection from heart 
attack, but he speculated that it could be the types of polyunsaturated 
vegetable fats.

IN BRIEF: CALTECH CHEMIST HONORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From staff and wire reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Physical chemist Norman R. Davidson of Caltech last week was named the winner 
of the 1989 Robert A. Welch Award in Chemistry. The award, which carries a 
$225,000 prize, is considered one of the most prestigious in chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson used the techniques of physical chemistry to devise new ways to 
visualize, isolate, and manipulate segments of DNA, the genetic blueprint of 
life. In particular, he and his students devised a technique for attaching 
labels to individual chemicals in DNA so they could be viewed under a 
microscope. This and other techniques he developed made possible many of the 
recent achievements of genetic engineering. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson, 73, has been at Caltech since 1946.

SENIOR DRIVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Much publicity has been properly given to the valiant efforts of the Police 
Department to cut down on accidents resulting from drunk drivers. This is a 
major effort, which is rightfully applauded by all citizens. 
</P>
<P>
I have a suggestion that I think will contribute a great deal to safety on the 
highways. I believe all citizens over the age of 75 (which includes me) should 
have their license renewed for only one year at a time and that an actual 
driving test be mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
There are far too many senior citizens on the roads that, if subjected to a 
driving test, would fail to pass. And this group too constitutes a safety 
hazard.

FLORIDA GUN LAW

<P>
How enlightened of the Florida legislature to consider a law recognizing that 
children don't kill children, guns kill children (to paraphrase the National 
Rifle Assn.'s favorite platitude) (Part I, June 16). How open-minded of the NRA 
to support that law in the face of almost certain passage. How stupid we all 
are, allowing the paranoid NRA to continually prevent reasonable firearm 
control. 
</P>
<P>
Too little, too late, Florida, for the five children and many others who have 
paid the price for our right to own "adult" toys.

CHULA VISTA JAIL RIOT HURTS MORE THAN 50 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A riot involving more than 50 inmates broke out at County Jail in Chula Vista 
early Sunday, leaving 12 inmates injured and forcing guards to call in 
additional sheriff's deputies and Chula Vista police for reinforcements. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. John Scheck, a watch commander at the jail at 500 3rd Ave., said the 
outburst appeared to have been racially motivated, "with whites fighting blacks 
and blacks fighting whites. The fights were distinctive as to color." 
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged that a more likely cause was tension caused by 
overcrowding. Module 1-B, in which the fights broke out, has a listed capacity 
of 24 but is occupied by 137 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
Scheck said a deputy notified jail control at about 1:30 a.m. that a number of 
inmates were fighting, "and when we got there, it was an all-out fight -- in 
some cases, two to three fights going on at once." 
</P>
<P>
He said the inmates were using broom handles, fists and feet, and that most of 
the injuries consisted of cuts to the back, neck and face. He said a warning 
horn was sounded repeatedly to quell the riot, to no avail. Finally, 22 
deputies were summoned, along with 11 Chula Vista police officers and a crew of 
paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
Seven inmates suffered more serious injuries and were taken to local hospitals.

REP. ROHRABACHER ON COLD FUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In defending cold-fusion chemists Pons and Fleischmann as brave challengers of 
the status quo, Rohrabacher misses the point of much of the criticism against 
them. Most scientists were excited by the reports of cold fusion, and frankly, 
a bit amused that two chemists working on their own could tweak the tail of the 
giant federal labs. What really bothered most critics is that after Pons and 
Fleischmann announced their claims in a press conference, they were so busy 
talking to reporters and testifying before Congress they had no time to publish 
their results in a scientific journal or defend them in scientific meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Good science only emerges through the intense scrutiny of vigorous debate. Pons 
and Fleischmann shied from this test. When Copernicus and Galileo kept their 
theories to themselves, what they feared was persecution from the government 
(actually, the church, the same thing in those days), not criticism from other 
scientists. For Pons and Fleischmann, it was the reverse. They sought the 
refuge of reporters and politicians to avoid the scrutiny of their scientific 
peers.

REP. ROHRABACHER ON COLD FUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once a turkey, always a turkey. Rep. Rohrabacher reaches far back into history 
to cite the public and "official" reactions to research, theories, and 
inventions, mostly occurring prior to the establishment of what is known as the 
"scientific method." This notion, evolved from the late 1600s to the present, 
is that an experimental researcher presents the work in a clear fashion, 
indicating the details of the equipment, the measuring devices, the 
environmental conditions, the step-by-step method used, and the results. The 
glaring problem with the Pons-Fleischmann announcement of the achievement of 
cold fusion is that they didn't bother to carefully document their methods and 
measurements for others to review and replicate. 
</P>
<P>
I was a high school student when the first laser was devised. Within the year, 
virtually every high school regional science fair had a least one entrant who 
had replicated the device. In college, every physics major could follow the 
recipe set out by Einstein to demonstrate the photoelectric effect of light, an 
experiment that challenged the previously accepted notion that light was fully 
defined as a wave phenomena. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Rohrabacher states that the would-be discoverers of cold fusion "have done 
nothing wrong." But of course they have done something wrong. They haven't 
documented their years of research in a clear manner so others in their field 
can replicate the results, if there are any. That's what science is all about. 
They aren't being vilified because others are afraid or jealous. They're 
derided because they've been sloppy, certainly in the documentation, and maybe 
in the execution of the experiment.

ROCKY FLATS

<TEXT>
<P>
I am writing in regards to articles in The Times (Part I, June 10) concerning 
events in China and the FBI probe of the Rocky Flats facilities. 
</P>
<P>
In both cases governments evidence a callous disregard for the rights and 
welfare of the citizenry. In response to the repression in China there is 
widespread outrage and protest. In regards to Rocky Flats nothing comparable 
has occurred, although thousands of people in the Denver area have been exposed 
to toxic pollutants illegally released from the plant and, likewise, because 
officials believe that they know best the priorities for this nation.

NEW JAIL NEAR CASTAIC ALMOST READY TO RECEIVE 2,800 OF COUNTY'S MOST DANGEROUS 
INMATES 
</P>

<P>
Sometime in the next two to four months, 2,800 men will arrive in buses to live 
for up to a year in the hills below Castaic. Unlike many residents of the area 
who commute to distant jobs, the newcomers will be within walking distance of 
their jobs in a new bakery, print shop and textile factory. They will also have 
ready access to facilities for exercise, basketball games, card playing and 
other hobbies. 
</P>
<P>
These men will not be among the hundreds who have flocked to the area in recent 
years to escape the perils of big city living. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, their experience of the countryside will be limited to glimpses through 
the rectangular, 4-inch-wide bulletproof windows in their new home: a 
$131-million maximum-security jail complex scheduled to open soon at the Peter 
J. Pitchess Honor Rancho, Los Angeles County's largest jail complex. 
</P>
<P>
The men will be among the county's most dangerous criminals. Most of them will 
be sent to the facility while awaiting trial or sentencing for such felonies as 
murder, armed robbery, assault and rape. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Relative Danger 
</P>
<P>
"On a danger scale of one to 10, they are seven or better," said county 
Sheriff's Capt. Michael A. Nelson, who since April has supervised planning for 
the facility and who will be its director when it opens. 
</P>
<P>
Called the North County Correctional Facility, the 680,000-square-foot complex 
will increase the jail's population of minimum-, medium- and maximum-security 
inmates from about 7,500 to more than 10,000. It will about double the maximum 
security population to about 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
The jail, east of the Golden State Freeway between Santa Clarita and Castaic, 
for 40 years was known as the Wayside Honor Rancho until officials changed its 
name in 1982 to honor the former county sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
The new complex, built partly to relieve crowding in the 6,800-inmate Men's 
Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles, will be the latest step in the evolution 
of the rural, 2,865-acre jail site from a minimum-security "honor ranch" for 
low-risk inmates to a sophisticated, high-tech detention facility for dangerous 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sophisticated Electronics 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said the new complex, which is about 98% complete, will be among the 
most advanced of its kind in the nation. It will incorporate the latest in 
electronic surveillance and automated security systems, he said, while 
affording inmates opportunities for work and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
Located behind an existing maximum-security facility, the complex consists of 
four two-story detention buildings and a one-story structure connected by long 
corridors. Four of the buildings are divided into dormitory-style cells for 32 
inmates apiece, while a fifth, "high-risk" building has 196 individual cells 
for the most dangerous inmates. 
</P>
<P>
A "discipline" section in the high-risk building has 48 individual cells for 
unruly inmates who will be sent to the cells for up to 10 days at a time and 
allowed only an hour of exercise per week, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
The complex has three heavily guarded outdoor exercise areas. Seven smaller 
ones, all covered with heavy metal mesh, are in courtyards in the inmate 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TV Monitors, Cameras 
</P>
<P>
From a central command post, guards will be able to see virtually every corner 
of the complex through 20 television monitors linked to 128 cameras posted 
throughout the facility's five main buildings, Nelson said. Every door, from 
individual cell doors to the main entrance gates, can be electronically locked 
and unlocked from the command post, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Using the electronic locks, guards should be able to contain inmate 
disturbances by instantly locking doors leading to other areas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who thinks they can get a key from someone and get into another part of 
the building is sadly mistaken," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said the facility's design has nothing in common with the recently 
completed federal Metropolitan Detention Center downtown, from which five men 
escaped June 18 after cutting through metal mesh enclosing an eighth-floor 
recreation area. The men, who were awaiting trial or sentencing for federal 
crimes, used a rope made of bedsheets to lower themselves to the street. One of 
them was arrested several hours after the escape, another was arrested Sunday; 
the other three remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Heavier Screen 
</P>
<P>
"We have no design similarities with their operation," Nelson said. "Our 
screening in outdoor recreation areas is considerably heavier than the 
screening they use." 
</P>
<P>
In case of fire, a computer connected to alarms will automatically print out 
instructions showing the quickest route to the blaze, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
The jail is more than a high-tech detention center, Nelson said. It also puts 
inmates to work to save the county money and to develop occupational skills 
that they may be able to use after their sentences end, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Inmates working in a new, 10,000-square-foot bakery will bake 25,000 loaves of 
bread every day for 22,000 inmates in the county's eight jails, Nelson said. 
Others will be put to work in a 19,000-square-foot sewing shop to manufacture 
T-shirts and underwear for inmates, and some inmates will work in a print shop 
producing crime report forms and other documents used by the Sheriff's 
Department, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Keep a Man Busy' 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, if you can keep a man busy, give him a job, it's better for him -- 
and for us, too," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to putting inmates to work, the complex will employ 368 uniformed 
guards and 144 paid cooks, bakers, clerks and other personnel to supervise 
inmate workers, Nelson said. The Sheriff's Department is accepting applications 
for many of those positions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said planners designed the complex using suggestions from guards and 
captains at other county jails. He said the design should prevent a repeat of 
the March, 1985, jailbreak in which seven inmates, including one murderer, 
escaped from the existing maximum-security unit, which was built in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
The escaped murderer burglarized a home in nearby Bouquet Canyon before 
authorities arrested him in downtown Los Angeles. Five of the other escapees 
were captured not far from the jail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Little Opposition 
</P>
<P>
Despite the escapes, news that nearly 3,000 additional high-risk criminals will 
be moving into the area apparently has not stirred community opposition. 
Several homeowners who live across the freeway from the jail said in interviews 
that they are not worried that inmates might escape and commit crimes in their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really not worried about it," said Bill Straughan, who lives with his wife 
and two young daughters in a neighborhood north of Hasley Canyon Road. "It's 
full-security, and so is my home -- we have an alarm. By expanding it out here, 
they'll save taxpayers money. They're going to have to put it somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Straughan added, however, that he worries about additional traffic from people 
visiting inmates. And he wants the jail to change its practice of releasing 
inmates at the jail's main entrance. If no one is there to pick up the inmates, 
he said, they might wander into the neighborhood and commit crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Andy Swanson, a California Highway Patrol officer, said he does not 
welcome the new inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something to think about," he said. "Even the way it is right now, it's a 
constant thought. If they ever escape, where are they going to go?"

DUMPING RAISES RENEWED CALL FOR BARRIERS AT SCENIC CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The weekend discovery of barrels that once contained potentially dangerous 
chemicals illegally dumped in a canyon in the Santa Susana Mountains has 
prompted an environmental group to renew its call for roadside barriers to 
reduce access to the area. 
</P>
<P>
"We can clean it up but we'll never solve the problem until we get a barrier 
here," said Glenn Bailey, president of the Foundation for the Preservation of 
the Santa Susana Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey called a news conference Sunday at the site, about one-third of a mile 
east of Rocky Peak Road on Santa Susana Pass Road, to denounce the dumping of 
37 55-gallon steel drums. 
</P>
<P>
The drums are believed to have been left at the site sometime Saturday. A 
motorist driving past the site in the mountains above Chatsworth about 9 p.m. 
noticed a red sticker on one of the drums indicating that it had contained 
combustible materials, and he contacted Los Angeles County Department of Health 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flammable Material 
</P>
<P>
According to the labels, the drums once contained a polyester resin compound, 
mixed with toluene. Toluene is flammable and can cause dizziness and other 
health problems if its fumes are inhaled at high concentrations. The materials 
are used in the production of certain plastics. 
</P>
<P>
But Los Angeles city firefighters who went to the scene Sunday determined that 
the barrels were virtually empty. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Cervantes, a senior hazardous materials specialist with the county 
Department of Health, also tested the barrels and discovered that at least one 
contained enough fumes to pose "an immediate fire hazard." The others were 
empty but, as a precaution, Cervantes contacted the state Department of Health 
Services, which agreed to remove the barrels Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The white and green drums were dumped in a canyon that offers dramatic views of 
the west San Fernando Valley. But the landscape is marred with the rusting 
hulks of abandoned cars, ripped-open mattresses, multihued household garbage 
and other debris, all discarded in the steep canyon from several convenient 
roadside pull-offs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Owns Property 
</P>
<P>
Bailey said the state owns 428 acres surrounding the canyon that are the scene 
of weekend hikes sponsored by the preservation group. He said the foundation 
has lobbied state officials to get a $1-million barrier installed along Santa 
Susana Pass Road to make it difficult for trucks to park at the edge of the 
canyon to dump their loads. 
</P>
<P>
"We're also asking for the apprehension and prosecution to the full extent of 
the law, not only of the people who dumped this, but also for the people who 
owned it," Bailey said. "We're going to draw the public's attention to this and 
not let it get any worse." 
</P>
<P>
Cervantes said the owners of the barrels could be traced using information on 
the labels. Because the containers were nearly empty, only public nuisance 
charges, and not felony hazardous materials dumping charges, could be brought 
against their owners, Cervantes said. 
</P>
<P>
Bernice Thompson, who is the closest resident to the dump site, said she 
frequently sees trucks disposing of their loads into the canyon. "We sometimes 
catch trucks and we call the police," she said. "We do our best but of course 
we can't catch everyone."

5 KILLED IN WEEKEND VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Violence claimed the lives of at least five people in Los Angeles County over 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the deaths came in Pomona: an elderly brother and sister on Sunday and 
a teen-age boy interrupting an argument at a party early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
An 89-year-old man and his 81-year-old sister were found bludgeoned to death 
about 10 a.m. Sunday, Pomona Police Lt. Ernie Allsup said. He had no further 
details to release. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Huizar, 17, was shot once in the chest at 12:13 a.m. Saturday, Allsup 
said. As a party was ending, Huizar tried to stop a dispute between a 
16-year-old boy and a girl there. The 16-year-old allegedly shot Huizar and 
fled. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was arrested later at his sister's home. He is being held on 
suspicion of murder at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall, Allsup said. 
</P>
<P>
In South-Central Los Angeles, Raul Ayala, 25, a former gang member, was shot to 
death about 2 a.m. Saturday in an alley behind a home in the 1400 block of East 
20th Street, police said. In Hollywood, 20-year-old Jose Varas was shot and 
killed Friday night in a dispute with some suspected gang members, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Others wounded in weekend violence included a Newhall man, Ismael Santana, 19, 
who was shot shortly before midnight Sunday, and hospitalized in critical 
condition, and an unidentified man stabbed and hospitalized in the Harbor area 
of Los Angeles.

'ROMEO AND JULIET' A PLAY WITH 2 TELLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Comparisons in theater aren't odious: They're enlightening. Consider the two 
productions of "Romeo and Juliet" that opened over the weekend, one in San 
Diego and one in Garden Grove. Each is an outdoor staging and each takes a 
traditional approach to the material. But, oh, what a difference. 
</P>
<P>
At the Old Globe Theatre (director: Richard E. T. White), we get a respectful 
mounting of a "great play." At the Grove Shakespeare Festival (director: Jules 
Aaron), we get an urgent telling of a wonderful story. 
</P>
<P>
The first difference is the design. At the Old Globe, the idea is to give us a 
picture of a real Italian square at high noon -- which, with a pull of a 
curtain, can become a real balcony at midnight. It is, as they say, as good as 
a movie. (Steven Rubin designed both the settings and costumes, and Robert 
Peterson did the painterly lighting.) 
</P>
<P>
Compare the paltry look of the Garden Grove production: the unfurnished set (by 
D. Martyn Bookwalter), the flimsy costumes (by Dwight Richard Odle), the 
generalized lighting (by David Palmer). Aside from the odd central element used 
for Juliet's balcony -- it looks like a corkscrew crossed with a crow's nest -- 
there's nothing to look at but the actors. 
</P>
<P>
Which means that the actors can't consider themselves figures in a landscape. 
They have to come out and sell the play. And they do. This isn't the subtlest 
production of "Romeo and Juliet" that you'll ever see, but it's in touch with 
the play's energy sources in a way that the San Diego production isn't. All the 
play's channels are open, not just the woeful ones. 
</P>
<P>
That's ironic, because it's the San Diego production that works harder at the 
details: at suggesting that Juliet's parents (Mike Genovese and Ellen Crawford) 
haven't slept together for years, for example, or that Romeo's cousin Benvolio 
(Albert Farrar) isn't much of a swordsman. 
</P>
<P>
Time gets lost in these little touches, however. The Garden Grove production 
makes its own points but makes them on the wing. When Friar Laurence (Harry 
Woolf) says farewell to Romeo (David Anthony Smith), a slight pause before his 
last "goodby" is enough to convey how much he's going to miss him. The idea is 
to convey the suddenness of love and death, not to linger on subsidiary 
insights. 
</P>
<P>
The play therefore seems much shorter and more clearly focused than in San 
Diego, although its running time is only 15 minutes less. Tempo isn't the only 
reason. Aaron's cast bites into the text with appreciation, as if they would 
rather be speaking Shakespeare than anything else. White's San Diego actors 
speak correctly, but they don't celebrate the language. Only Ken Ruta (Friar 
Laurence) and Mitchell Edmonds (Montague) account for every single word. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the play are Romeo and Juliet. In San Diego, Jon Tenney makes 
a good beginning, but doesn't sufficiently distinguish between the character's 
early lovesickness for Rosaline (Martha Perantoni) and his later bonding with 
Juliet. He needs to go deeper, while Monique Fowler needs to explore Juliet's 
vivacity, temper and intelligence. The major theme of her performance at the 
moment is that Juliet is suffering from emotions too large to be expressed. 
This is the way poignancy is conveyed on the soaps. It won't do for three 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Compare Susan Doupe's Juliet at Garden Grove, a delicate girl who believes in 
seizing the moment. She is eager to love, both because Romeo (David Anthony 
Smith) has captured her heart and because it's something of a prank of her 
parents (Larry Franklin and Pam Fisher). And in the tomb scene she is ready to 
die. Without lacking lyricism, this Juliet avoids the customary mooning around. 
She knows exactly what she's feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's Romeo may be a bit of a twit, but he does suggest a young aristocrat, 
well trained at the fencing academy, and a man of feeling. He's sincerely 
concerned when Mercutio (John Walcutt) gets so carried away with his language 
that he almost falls into a fit. (Michael Cerveris' Mercutio at the Old Globe 
keeps both feet on the ground at all times.) This Romeo cares, and we can care 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the play works at one venue, and works much less well at the other. 
Leaving the Old Globe, you wonder if you haven't seen it too often. Leaving the 
Grove, it's a new play again, filled with possibilities. Shakespeare is a 
genius or a drone, depending on his helpers.

SAGON PENN SURFACES IN NEW LEGAL HASSLE: TUCK'S DIVORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sagon Penn's name continues to pop up in the strangest places, evidenced by its 
appearance in the divorce papers of Channel 10 newsman Michael Tuck. 
</P>
<P>
A clause in the otherwise typical divorce agreement, reached last year, 
stipulates that any profits Tuck receives from an NBC miniseries on Penn will 
be donated to charity. If Tuck doesn't give the money to charity, the court 
retains jurisdiction to divide the property, according to the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never heard of a miniseries being part of a divorce," the program's 
producer, Stockton Briggle, said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
Briggle is the producer of the recent television movies "A Bridge to Silence" 
and "The Alamo: 13 Days to Glory." In 1987 he struck a development deal with 
NBC and dispatched two writers, Travis Clark and Steve Duncan, to San Diego to 
research the Penn story. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Penn, a young black man, shot two San Diego police officers and a 
civilian ride-a-long, killing one of the officers. After his attorney argued 
that Penn was defending himself from a racially motivated attack, Penn was 
acquitted in two trials that struck the raw nerve of racial tension in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The two writers gave Briggle an outline for a 4-hour miniseries on Penn, and 
the movie deal has lain relatively dormant since then. But it is not dead. 
</P>
<P>
The program is still on NBC's production schedule, said Briggle, who is 
producing the program in conjunction with Fries Entertainment, producers of 
recent television docudramas on Lyndon Johnson and the Hillside Strangler case. 
Briggle said he is looking for a new writer for the project, after Clark and 
Duncan were called away from the project to work on a television series, "A Man 
Called Hawk." 
</P>
<P>
Although Briggle has discussed paying key players for their cooperation, he has 
not signed any of the principals to contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"We have maintained a close relationship with some of the principals," Briggle 
said, with the notable exceptions of Donovan Jacobs, the officer accused by 
Penn of initiating the confrontation, and Colleen Riggs, the wife of slain 
policeman Thomas Riggs. 
</P>
<P>
Briggle's representatives contacted Tuck, along with most people involved in 
the case, in 1987, seeking cooperation in the development of "The Sagon Penn 
Story." Tuck, who often supported Penn's story in his "Perspective" segments, 
made it clear at the time that any money paid him for his cooperation would 
have to be donated to charity, if indeed he received any money at all. The 
clause was put into the divorce agreement at the insistence of his ex-wife's 
attorney, Tuck said, in case he changed his mind about donating any profits to 
charity, something he said he has no intention of doing. 
</P>
<P>
Tuck says the producers were talking about "$50,000 or $75,000" for his help, 
figures Briggle says are "optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
Since most of the story already has been played out in San Diego courtrooms, 
making it part of the public domain, it may not be necessary to pay any of the 
principals, Briggle said. 
</P>
<P>
The movie he envisions would not seek to portray Penn as a hero, or to 
concentrate on the racial overtones of the case, Briggle said. He's fascinated 
by the vastly different perceptions people have of the same incident. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many stories of so many things gone wrong," Briggle said. 
"There's Sagon Penn, who was going to apply for a job with the Police 
Department. There's Donovan Jacobs, who was doing his job to the best of his 
ability as he saw it. There's (former San Diego Police Lt.) Doyle Wheeler, who 
felt he had to tell the truth as he saw it. (Wheeler testified against Jacobs 
and later was injured by a gunshot to the head in his new home in Seattle in a 
still-unexplained incident.) There are a lot of broken lives in this. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no good guys or bad guys; there are vast areas of gray here." 
</P>
<P>
Since it was never his intent to portray Penn as a "big hero," Briggle said 
Penn's recent legal troubles -- initially charged with suspicion of attempted 
murder after a confrontation with his ex-girlfriend's boyfriend, he has been 
charged with misdemeanor battery -- would not affect the project. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just more ripples in the pool," Briggle said, adding that once a writer 
is found, the project should "gel very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Want your restaurant to be featured on a "Sun Up" cooking segment? It's not 
hard. Just buy a commercial on the morning program. KFMB-TV (Channel 8) 
recently sent a letter to restaurants inviting them to participate in the 
morning show's cooking segment, in conjunction with "an inexpensive broadcast 
schedule," i.e. paid commercials. Channel 8 has a "full service production 
department to aid in the development of a strong, memorable commercial to 
coincide with your Sun-Up cooking segment." The quid pro quo offer is new, 
according to Channel 8 local sales manager Randy Bixler. "You have to 
understand, it's a select invitation list," he said, declining to specify how 
many restaurants were "invited.". . . 
</P>
<P>
XTRA-AM (690) producer Jackie Gladfelter put together a list of more than 100 
names, ranging from President Bush to Don Rickles, as possible guests for Steve 
Garvey's new morning show, which debuts this morning. Garvey's office approved 
all of the names except one -- "Today" show host Bryant Gumbel. Apparently 
Gumbel and Garvey don't get along. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The BBC has purchased the rights to air "Break of Dawn," the locally produced 
biography of Pedro Gonzalez, the first Spanish-speaking radio star in Los 
Angeles who was falsely imprisoned for rape after challenging the local 
bureaucracy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Officials at XTRA-FM (91X) proudly talk of the station's call letters appearing 
on tickets for the Who, part of the station's exclusive deal to promote the 
group's August concert in San Diego. Indeed, the station's logo will be on the 
front of all the tickets, including 20,000 commemorative tickets specially 
printed for the event. But the rest of the tickets will also bear the logo of 
another station -- KIFM (98.1). The jazz station's name appears on the back of 
all Ticketmaster tickets. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Beginning this morning the 91X morning team of Russ T. Nailz and Katy Manor 
won't have to drive to Tijuana anymore. They will be broadcasting from San 
Diego, under the provisions of a special permit which allows the Mexican-based 
station, owned by San Diego-based Noble Broadcast, to send signals from San 
Diego to Mexico for broadcasting. XTRA has used the permit for the AM side, and 
now it is extending it to include the 91X morning team, but not the other 91X 
shows. "We're going to see how it works out," XTRA Chief Operating Officer Norm 
Feuer said, refusing to elaborate. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Funding for the Soviet Arts Festival may be moving right along, but last week 
the city moved to cut funds for several social programs, including a grant to 
KPBS' reading service for the blind. Last year, the city gave the reading 
service $10,000, about one-tenth of its budget. This year the reading service 
asked for $20,000 and received nothing. "We're kind of stunned about it," 
reading service director Donna Warren said. Though new revenue sources will 
have to be found, she doesn't expect any changes in the service. Currently 
there are 90 people on the service's waiting list for receivers.

WHEN SMOKE CLEARS, ANGELS HOLD ON, 7-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That pack of cigarettes on Doug Rader's desk was nearing the end of a short 
life. It never really had a chance, not after what Rader endured during the 
ninth inning of a draining 7-6 Angel victory Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, it had been a regular stroll in the ballpark. The Angels had scored 
seven runs in the first three innings, producing a 15-hit attack that even 
included a home run by Wally Joyner -- his first since April 27, a homerless 
drought of 169 at-bats -- while putting the Angels in position to win their 
third consecutive game from the American League East-leading Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
But in the ninth, Rader handed the ball to reliever Bryan Harvey, along with a 
7-4 lead. 
</P>
<P>
One out and four batters later, Baltimore had the bases loaded and Cal Ripken 
at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
As visions of extra innings danced in Oriole heads, Harvey painstakingly worked 
the count to 2-2, including a check swing that was called ball three by plate 
umpire Derryl Cousins. However, Cousins was overruled on appeal by first base 
umpire Mike Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, a full swing and a miss. Ripken was gone. Baltimore was down to a 
final out. 
</P>
<P>
Up stepped Mickey Tettleton, Baltimore's cleanup hitter and home-run leader. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey walked him on five pitches, forcing in a run. The Angels led, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Up stepped Joe Orsulak, who had homered off Angel starter Kirk McCaskill in the 
second inning. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey walked him on a full count, forcing in another run. The Angels led, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
Up stepped Jim Traber, who had beaten the Angels Thursday night with an 
eighth-inning pinch home run and had a double, a single and a drive to the 
center-field wall in his first three at-bats Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey fired his first pitch, and Traber swung for the fences. 
</P>
<P>
The bat swished through the air for strike one. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey fired a second pitch, a fastball on the outside corner. 
</P>
<P>
Traber took it for strike two. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey fired a third pitch, another fastball, "as hard as I could throw it," he 
would say later. 
</P>
<P>
Traber swung and missed again. The game was over. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the smoke still hadn't cleared. 
</P>
<P>
"Smoke?" Rader asked innocently when someone noticed the limp package of 
cigarettes on his desk. "Oh, I don't smoke. That's just a prop to make you guys 
think it's bugging me. That's part of my managerial deal, the aura I'm trying 
to create." 
</P>
<P>
Rader was asked about Harvey's wild ride through the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew what Harv was doing," Rader deadpanned. "He wasn't tricking us. He's 
pulled that stuff before . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He was just working on a save. He's thinking, 'I haven't got a save in a 
while. Well, if you guys can't get me one, I'll do it myself.' It took some 
doing to get into that situation, but when it came down to crunch time, it was 
boom, boom, boom. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty obvious he did it on purpose." 
</P>
<P>
About as obvious as Harvey's angry spike of the baseball after the final out? 
</P>
<P>
"Well, that's part of his act," Rader said. "Harv. He's such a goofball." 
</P>
<P>
A few feet outside Rader's door, Harvey continued to grouse about his 
three-hit, two-walk ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just gotta get sharp," Harvey said. "My forkball wasn't sharp today. The 
other day, my heater wasn't good. It's hard to get in rhythm when you're not 
pitching." 
</P>
<P>
Harvey, who last pitched Wednesday night, was miffed at many things -- himself, 
his recent lack of work, his belief that Cousins was inconsistent with his 
strike calls. 
</P>
<P>
"The strike he called on Traber was the same pitch I walked Tettleton on," 
Harvey said. "When they gave me the ball after the game, I started to throw it 
at the home plate umpire. But I stopped myself and slapped it on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"I was more upset with myself, walking those two guys there." 
</P>
<P>
If saves were fishes, Harvey might be tempted to throw this one back. But as 
ugly as it was, he's stuck with it, increasing his staff-leading total to nine. 
</P>
<P>
And all those runs the Angels scored off starter Jeff Ballard (9-3) in the 
first three innings, leaving the Orioles seemingly buried at 7-1? Turns out, 
the Angels needed every one of them. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner drove in three, two on a first-inning double. But his solo home run in 
the third inning was far more significant, considering the frequency of Joyner 
home runs these days. 
</P>
<P>
This was Joyner's second home run of the season. In fact, it was his second 
since last Sept. 1, a span of 352 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't had too much practice (trotting around the bases after a home run)," 
conceded Joyner, who sprinted as far as third base before realizing what he had 
done. 
</P>
<P>
Rader, however, chose to downplay the homerless streak. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like he hasn't been swinging pretty good," Rader said. "He's hit some 
balls that didn't go out, only because they were hit too high or hit too well 
-- hard line drives that didn't have the trajectory. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not concerned with Wally Joyner." 
</P>
<P>
Rader has other worries. Sunday's ninth inning, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
He has the cigarette butts to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
The ranks of the ailing Angels are swelling. While catcher Lance Parrish was 
given a third consecutive day off to rest a sore back and Johnny Ray played 
again on a sprained left big toe, the Angels reported injuries to pitcher Greg 
Minton and outfielder Claudell Washington that leave Manager Doug Rader 
shorthanded when the club begins a six-game trip in Cleveland Tuesday night. 
Minton has a sprained right elbow. X-rays were negative. Washington has a shin 
condition Angel doctors are calling "tendinitis with cellulitis," the latter 
being inflammation of the skin tissue that wraps around the bone. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels scored all of their runs against Jeff Ballard, who failed to record 
an out in the third inning. Once 9-1, Ballard has now had 52 baserunners in his 
last 19 2/3 innings. Sunday's outing increased his ERA from 2.71 to 3.28. . . . 
Kirk McCaskill's ERA also rose, from 2.87 to 3.00. McCaskill (8-4) lasted five 
innings, giving up three runs on eight hits, including home runs to Joe Orsulak 
and Larry Sheets, who hit a second homer off Den Petry.

BLUSHING JOHN WINS IN HOLLYWOOD GOLD CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neither the jockey nor the horse was available for comment after the race, but 
Blushing John said enough during the two minutes or so it took him to win the 
$500,000 Hollywood Gold Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Correcting an oversight from his last race, Blushing John took the lead on the 
far turn Sunday and then comfortably held off Sabona at the wire to win the 
50th Gold Cup by one length. The order of the first two finishers was reversed 
in the shorter Californian three weeks ago, when Sabona rallied for a 1 
1/4-length victory. 
</P>
<P>
This time, before a Hollywood Park crowd of 28,939, Sabona settled for second 
place, finishing 3 1/2 lengths in front of Payant, one of three starters 
saddled by Charlie Whittingham, who was trying to win his ninth Gold Cup. 
Whittingham's other starters -- Lively One and Nasr El Arab -- finished fourth 
and fifth, respectively. Nasr El Arab never was a factor, and Lively One faded 
after he got a nose in front of the pace-setting Henbane just before Blushing 
John took the lead on the turn. 
</P>
<P>
Favored Blushing John, ridden by Pat Day, ran 1 1/4 miles in 2:00 2/5 and paid 
$4.60, $2.60 and $2.20. Sabona paid $3 and $2.60, and Payant returned $3.40. 
Blushing John, European-raced until last November, won for the fourth time in 
seven American starts, earned $275,000 for his owner, Allen Paulson, and 
increased his career total to $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Gold Cup went off at 5:27 p.m., only 33 minutes before Day's return flight 
to Chicago. Day must have made the plane, considering the way he darted from 
the winner's circle to the jockeys' room and out of the race track en route to 
LAX. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Pat to do something different than what he did last time," said Dick 
Lundy, who trains all of Paulson's horses in the United States. "In the 
Californian, we were worried about one horse -- Ruhlmann -- and I think we 
might have used our horse more than we wanted in order to make sure he didn't 
get away from us. 
</P>
<P>
"This time, I told Pat to ride his own race and not worry about anybody else. 
Neil Drysdale's horse (Sabona) ran a good race, but I didn't think he'd catch 
us, because my horse came home in 24 seconds flat." 
</P>
<P>
Until then, the pace was dull, with Henbane, a 37-1 shot making his first U.S. 
stakes appearance, running a half-mile in :47 2/5 and six furlongs in 1:11 4/5. 
Henbane finished sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a slow pace and a slow race, period," Whittingham said. "Every time 
Nasr El Arab tried to move up, they'd move away from him again. A slow pace 
doesn't help a horse like that." 
</P>
<P>
Nasr El Arab was last in the seven-horse field after a half-mile and moved up 
to fifth after three-quarters of a mile, but he was still about six lengths off 
the lead, which is just about where he was when Blushing John hit the wire. 
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron has won more than 130 stakes at Hollywood Park, but he has never 
won a Gold Cup. Sabona gave him his eighth second-place finish in 10 tries. 
</P>
<P>
"Lordy, second-best again," McCarron said. "It felt like they were walking up 
front today. I had my horse relaxing on a loose rein. He ran his tail off, but 
he just wasn't good enough." 
</P>
<P>
Like Whittingham, Pat Valenzuela, the rider on Nasr El Arab, bemoaned the slow 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
"Claiming horses run faster than that," Valenzuela said. "We moved up a little 
coming around the turn, and my horse had a little bit of a kick, but he didn't 
have the kick that the others had. He handled the track good, but I was upset 
that the fractions weren't faster." 
</P>
<P>
The Gold Cup was only the third start on dirt for Nasr El Arab. He won the 
Strub at Santa Anita in February on the main track, but that was in mud, and on 
a fast track in the Santa Anita Handicap he couldn't take to the going and 
finished eighth as the 7-5 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Lively One ran early as though he might win his first stake since he took the 
Swaps at Hollywood 11 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I had great position," said his jockey, Robbie Davis. "But then he didn't 
finish as strong as I thought. We were supposed to be closer than he usually 
is, and that's where we were. He had a beautiful trip, but I needed more 
horse." 
</P>
<P>
After the Gold Cup, Paulson, who paid $850,000 for Blushing John, proclaimed 
that the 4-year-old son of Blushing Groom and La Griffe is the best older horse 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"He beat the horses that ran Saturday in Chicago (in the Budweiser-Hawthorne 
Gold Cup), and now he's beaten the best they have here," Paulson said. 
</P>
<P>
Blushing John will return to grass in his next start, the United Nations 
Handicap at Atlantic City, N.J., on July 19, in preparation for the Arlington 
Million on Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the year calls for a return to dirt, climaxed by the $3-million 
Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream Park on Nov. 4. Sunday Silence, winner of 
the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, and Easy Goer, winner of the Belmont, 
should be the most formidable opposition then. 
</P>
<P>
"We're shooting for horse of the year," Paulson said. "I thought we won it in 
1987, when Theatrical won the Breeders' Cup Turf, but Ferdinand beat us out 
when he won the Classic. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently, you've got to win the big Breeders' Cup dirt race to get horse of 
the year. And if that's what it takes, that's the race we'll run in." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The attendance of 28,939 was the lowest in Gold Cup history. The previous low 
was the crowd of 33,227 last year. The biggest crowd for the stake, 58,971, saw 
Native Diver win his first of three consecutive Gold Cups in 1965. . . . 
Sunday's handle of $9 million, which included money bet by 9,000 fans at nine 
off-track locations, barely missed the record for a Gold Cup day, and the 
amount bet on the stake, $1.1 million, was a record. 
</P>
<P>
In another stake at Hollywood Park Sunday, Sam Who got his fifth consecutive 
victory by taking the $140,150 Budweiser Breeders' Cup by a half-length over 
Star Cutter. Sam Who, trained by Henry Moreno and ridden by Laffit Pincay, paid 
$8.40 to win in his grass debut, running six furlongs in 1:08. . . . Hollywood 
Park will be closed today, Tuesday and Wednesday, then resume racing for six 
consecutive days through July 4, and will be dark again on Wednesday, July 5.

JONES WINS IN CANADA AS BURROUGHS FALTERS

Steve Jones became the first three-time winner on the PGA Tour this year, but 
he didn't win the Canadian Open golf championship at Oakville, Canada, as much 
as Clark Burroughs lost it. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, who won the first two tournaments of 1989, caught Burroughs on the 16th 
hole and passed him with a birdie on the 17th. He finished with a final round 
of two-under-par 70 and a 72-hole score of 271 on the Glen Abbey Golf Club 
course in Ontario, winning by two strokes. 
</P>
<P>
"To win, I thought I'd have to play better than I did," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones trailed most of the day but made his move on the last three holes with 
some help from Burroughs, who was in contention for the first time in his 
three-year tour career. Burroughs missed putts on the last three holes. 
</P>
<P>
"Three putts," he said after a final-round 74. "Four feet, eight feet, six 
feet. Yip, yip, yip. My hands were shaking on the short putts. That's where I 
lost the tournament, on the greens." 
</P>
<P>
Burroughs was tied at 273 with Mike Hulbert, who shot a 64, and Mark 
Calcavecchia, who had a 69. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Dent sank a short eagle putt on the 17th hole to overtake Dick Hendrickson 
and win the $300,000 MONY Senior tournament at Syracuse, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Dent overcame a five-stroke deficit to win $45,000. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first PGA victory for Dent, who was winless in 18 years on the 
regular tour. He joined the Senior PGA Tour last month. 
</P>
<P>
Dent, 50, of St. Petersburg, Fla., shot an eight-under-par 64 final-round for a 
54-hole total of 201. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrickson, the leader after each of the first two rounds with consecutive 
66s, finished at 203 after a 71. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrickson, who bogeyed the final hole, slipped into third place behind Al 
Geiberger, who closed with a 63 for a 202 total. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy King passed third-round leader Shirley Furlong and won the LPGA 
McDonald's Championship at Wilmington, Del., by shooting a four-under-par 67. 
</P>
<P>
King, who overcame a six-shot deficit over the final 16 holes with her 
six-birdie, two-bogey performance, finished with a 72-hole total of 272 for her 
fourth victory of the year. She earned $82,500 and moved ahead of Nancy Lopez 
into first place on the 1989 money-winning list with $365,986. 
</P>
<P>
Furlong, who led by four shots after three rounds, struggled to a 73 and 
finished tied with Pat Bradley for second place at 274. Bradley, the LPGA's 
all-time leading money-winner, shot a 68. 
</P>
<P>
Pearl Sinn of Bellflower won her second consecutive U.S. Women's Amateur Public 
Links title at Spokane, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old 1988 U.S. Amateur champion defeated Kelli Akers of French Lick, 
Ind., 2 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
Sinn said she plans to turn professional today. 
</P>
<P>
Buz Greene, Craig Steinberg and Paul Mohler led the South team past the North, 
4 1/2-1 1/2 in the opening event of the 78th California Golf Assn. Amateur 
Championship at Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Individual play begins today.

MIKE DOWNEY: DO YOUR HOMEWORK, THEN GUESSWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Danny Ferry, Sean Elliott, Stacey King and Glen Rice -- not necessarily in that 
order -- are supposed to be four of the first five players chosen in Tuesday's 
National Basketball Assn. college draft. And at least one of them is a total 
stiff. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble is, nobody knows which one. 
</P>
<P>
The Sacramento Kings wish they knew, because they are scheduled to choose first 
in the draft, barring an 11th-hour trade. Everybody's All-Pros, the Clippers, 
wish they knew, because they are set to go second. July is the one month of 
every year when every basketball lover in Los Angeles is talking about the 
Clippers, discussing when and how the player they picked in the June draft will 
get injured. 
</P>
<P>
Although they all seem to be sure things, one of these major cagers -- Ferry, 
Elliott, King and Rice -- will not pan out. It's a tradition. Every NBA draft 
turns out the same way the one of exactly 10 years ago did, when Magic Johnson 
went first. Among the next four picks, David Greenwood, Bill Cartwright, Greg 
Kelser and Sidney Moncrief were deemed inseparable. Two became journeymen, one 
a flop, the fifth an All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's draft also contains a surprise, somewhere, someone on the order of 
Mitch Richmond, who shot out the lights for the Golden State Warriors as a 
rookie, or someone such as Joe Dumars (18th pick) or Mark Jackson (also 18th) 
or A.C. Green (23rd), all of whom were overlooked in the opening hour of their 
respective drafts. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Norman, third of three first-round picks for the Clippers in 1987, turned 
out better than Reggie Williams and Joe Wolf did. The whole thing's a 
crapshoot. You roll the bones and then cross your fingers that your number 
comes up, because sometimes the No. 1 pick in the draft is a Patrick Ewing or 
an Akeem Olajuwon, but occasionally he is a Kent Benson or even a LaRue Martin, 
the dud of 1972. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, remarkably enough, considering their success, had four players last 
season who were the No. 1 picks of their drafts -- Magic, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, 
James Worthy and Mychal Thompson. Should they somehow get their mitts on Ralph 
Sampson, they could have another one. Maybe the Warriors will part with 
Sampson, now that they are signing honorable-mention All-Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Lakers and the NBA champion Detroit Pistons -- our sympathies to 
Laker fans who find it hard to read those last four words -- pick 26th and 27th 
in Tuesday's draft, chances are, their picks will be men one step removed from 
the Continental Basketball Assn. The Lakers are looking for somebody with good 
ability, good attitude and good hamstrings. The Pistons are looking for 
somebody to replace Rick Mahorn and therefore will draft the first kid who 
nails a Piston scout with an elbow. 
</P>
<P>
The rumor mill, by the way, has been grinding. Adrian Dantley and the No. 8 
pick in the draft reportedly were dangled by the Dallas Mavericks in the 
direction of the Kings, who refused to part with their No. 1 choice. The 
Clippers allegedly discussed sending the No. 2 pick to Cleveland for Ron Harper 
and the No. 25 pick, but Cavalier sources called it gossip without foundation. 
</P>
<P>
There is even one rumor that Sacramento will fool everybody and take Oklahoma's 
King with the top pick, partly because he is pushing 6 feet 11 inches, and 
partly because they like the idea of having a King named King. Heck, if that's 
how basketball people operate, any day now we can expect the Orlando Magic to 
make trade offers for Woolridge and Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Were we in charge of the club with the No. 1 pick, and we wanted to choose the 
best athlete available, our selection would be Arizona's Elliott. We loved what 
we saw of that guy. Even if we were desperate for a shooter -- and man, can 
Michigan's Rice shoot -- we still would go with Elliott, because he can shoot 
and penetrate and rebound and pass, the whole package. 
</P>
<P>
The scouting report on Ferry says he can do all these things as well, that he 
will become a Bill Laimbeer who can shoot from long range, as well as rebound. 
For some reason, though, we see Ferry becoming a steady, unspectacular player 
and not a great one, an asset who will never be a superstar. We could be badly 
mistaken, but a little voice tells us the best prospect out of the state of 
North Carolina this year is still J.R. Reid. 
</P>
<P>
Reid's stock has gone down everywhere but in that state, where the owner of the 
Charlotte Hornets, one George Shinn, is warning his general manager and coach 
not to pass up Reid with the No. 5 pick unless they are absolutely positive he 
will not pan out. The Hornets hardly need Reid to juice ticket sales, having 
sold out every game, but Shinn has a thing about not missing out on a potential 
local angle. This guy probably can't wait for a player to come along named 
Stacey Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Our thoughts today are with the Clippers, who could use a break. We recommend 
that whomever they draft, they hold off plugging him for ticket sales and 
putting him on the cover of their season yearbook until they sign the guy to a 
contract, lest he pull a Danny Manning and boycott training camp. Sign him, and 
then advertise him. 
</P>
<P>
With the right choice -- and with the Lakers losing a certain center -- 
Showtime could soon move to the poor side of town. We are pulling for the 
Clippers. We always do, this time of year.

FINLEY FEVER;

ANGEL STARTER SENDS A MESSAGE THAT COMES IN LOUD AND CLEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every night, the world comes to West Monroe, La., courtesy Charles and Sue 
Finley's satellite dish, but in recent weeks, the featured programming has 
turned almost other-worldly. 
</P>
<P>
For the past four years, the Finleys have spent their prime time monitoring the 
progress of their son, Chuck, a young plugger on the pitching mounds of the 
American League. Rather uneventful through its first three seasons, The Finley 
Report is now keeping Charles and Sue up well past their bedtime and on the 
edge of their sofa. 
</P>
<P>
Will Chuck get that no-hitter in Fenway Park? 
</P>
<P>
Just how many Baltimore Orioles is Chuck going to strike out? 
</P>
<P>
And how much more can Chuck lower that ERA of his, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
"They're getting a kick out of it," said the star of the show, Angel 
left-hander Chuck Finley. 
</P>
<P>
And not for such obvious reasons as Finley's 2.36 earned-run average, eight 
victories, six complete games or the 15 Orioles he struck out at Anaheim 
Stadium Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"They're finally getting to watch me pitch," Finley said. "When I was 
relieving, they'd stay up up till 2 or 3 in the morning, waiting for me to get 
in the game. They'd be there throwing stuff at the TV set. 
</P>
<P>
"The next night, they'd be so worn out, I'd go five innings or something and 
they wouldn't be able to stay up. They'd always miss it." 
</P>
<P>
Now, an Angel pocket schedule serves as the Finleys' TV guide. Since Chuck 
moved into the Angels' starting rotation in 1988, every fifth day, from April 
to October, is a couch potato day. 
</P>
<P>
Through late June, Finley has made tuning in enjoyable. After the 
trial-and-error of his first season as a starter -- he was 9-15 with a 4.17 ERA 
-- Finley, at 26, is currently tied for second in the American League in ERA, 
is third in complete games and is fifth in strikeouts with 80. 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen of them came Saturday night in an 8-3 victory over Baltimore, which 
equaled the 1989 major league, single-game high, set by Texas' Nolan Ryan on 
April 12 against Milwaukee. The 15 strikeouts were also the most by an Angel 
pitcher since 1986, when Mike Witt struck out 16 Seattle Mariners, and the most 
by an Angel left-hander since 1976, when Frank Tanana struck out 15 Oakland 
Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
They're going to play the All-Star game in Anaheim this year. With two weeks to 
go, Finley stands a good chance of being there to represent the home team. 
</P>
<P>
Is the world ready for Chuck Finley, American League All-Star? 
</P>
<P>
If not, Finley suggests the world should think about catching up. Soon. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't surprise me," Finley said, not boastfully, of his early-season 
success. "I knew if I was patient and kept working, something good had to come 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year, you see new faces come around and show up in the crowd. Why 
shouldn't one of them be me? What's wrong with Chuck Finley leading the league 
in wins? What's wrong with the California Angels having the best staff in 
baseball? 
</P>
<P>
"You look at all these other teams who do it and you wonder, 'What's it take?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
For Finley, it has actually taken very little. Just a few more runs . . . and 
one more pitch. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, he had become the new Charles 0. Finley. Lack of support was his 
middle name. In nine of his 15 losses, the Angels scored two runs or less. 
Fifteen of Finley's 24 decisions were decided by two runs or less. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Angels have scored nine runs twice, five runs twice, eight runs 
once and six runs once for Finley, who won each of those games. He also beat 
Detroit's Jack Morris, 1-0, en route to a 7-2 start. 
</P>
<P>
Finley recently weathered a four-game losing streak, breaking out against the 
Orioles Saturday, but again, that coincided with a team-wide offensive slump. 
The Angels scored a total of two runs in those four defeats, with Finley losing 
the first three by scores of 4-0 (to Kansas City's Mark Gubicza), 1-0 (to 
Cleveland's Greg Swindell) and 5-1 (to Ryan). 
</P>
<P>
Finally, two nights ago, Finley and the Angel batting order got in sync again. 
Four Angels hit home runs and Finley responded with the most overpowering game 
of his career -- 15 strikeouts, including 10 in the first five innings. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, the Orioles were privy to the little secret that has spread 
through the rest of the league this year. 
</P>
<P>
Finley's got a forkball. 
</P>
<P>
Pass it on. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Finley didn't have one. Strictly a fastball-curveball pitcher, 
Finley only began tinkering with a forkball during the final weeks of the 1988 
season, a season in which he lost more games than any Angel left-hander since 
1974. 
</P>
<P>
"It was sort of a desperation move," Finley said. "The pitches I had (before) 
were only going to carry me so far. You see a lot of pitchers struggle with two 
pitches, then they get one more and that gets them over the hump. 
</P>
<P>
"Take Dave Stewart. He wasn't successful until he developed a third pitch and 
started throwing the forkball. Now look at him." 
</P>
<P>
Now look at Finley. 
</P>
<P>
His quantum leap in status -- from just another left-hander to quality starter 
-- was never better illustrated than on May 26, his 10th start of the season, 
at Boston. On that night, Finley matched fastballs with Roger Clemens, threw a 
few past Wade Boggs and came within one bloop single of becoming the first 
left-hander to throw a no-hitter in Fenway Park in 72 years. 
</P>
<P>
Finley took his bid into the eighth inning when, with two outs, Red Sox 
shortstop Jody Reed fisted an inside pitch over second base that touched down 
just in front of the Angels' onrushing center fielder, Devon White. 
</P>
<P>
Finley finished with a one-hitter, the first of his career -- and a long ways 
from those midsummer days of 1986, when a cab ride in a major league city was 
enough to overwhelm him. 
</P>
<P>
Much ado has been made of Jim Abbott's plunge from college baseball into the 
big leagues, but when Finley was called up by the Angels in May, 1986, his 
professional baseball experience totaled 28 games and 41 innings. And unlike 
Abbott, Finley had never pitched in the Olympics or Europe or Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
Finley had barely made it beyond Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
Drafted by the Angels out of Northeast Louisiana State in June, 1985, Finley 
spent three months pitching for Class A Salem, Ore. Then, in 1986, he lasted 
less than two months at Class A Quad City before the Angels, riddled by 
injuries in their bullpen and needing a left-hander, any left-hander, decided 
to summon him. 
</P>
<P>
When the phone call came, Finley was floored. 
</P>
<P>
"We were getting on the bus, going from the hotel to the park," Finley said, 
"when the manager pulled me off the bus and told me, 'You're not gonna play. 
We're gonna be moving you out of here.' 
</P>
<P>
"I figured it was going to be double-A and didn't think nothing of it until he 
told me, 'Mike Port (the Angels general manager) is going to call you.' Then I 
got on the phone with Mike and he finally told me I was going to New York. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't sink in. He had to say it two, three times. I said, 'You sure you 
got the right guy?' I still couldn't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
Greater shocks awaited once Finley's plane landed in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"That was wild," Finley recalled. "Before that, Anaheim and Dallas were the 
biggest places I'd ever been. I'd never been to the big city. I only heard 
about New York City cab rides. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got to my (hotel) room, I order room service. A couple of pieces of 
chicken, $30. I was so damn scared, I didn't even want to venture outside. I 
stayed in the hotel. I'd never seen so damn many people on the street at 2 
o'clock in the day in all my life." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, Finley got to Yankee Stadium and slinked into the visitors clubhouse. 
Eventually, he found his designated locker stall. 
</P>
<P>
For a few moments, he simply stared at it. 
</P>
<P>
"There were two sets of pants, two sets of shirts with my name on the back," he 
said, almost with reverence. "I remember pulling my bag out and one of the 
clubhouse kids ran over and said, 'You don't do that here. I'm supposed to do 
it.' " 
</P>
<P>
As he recounted the story, Finley still seemed a little surprised he survived 
it all. At 23, Finley lasted the rest of the season with the Angels, pitching 
in long relief and fashioning with a 3-1 record and a 3.30 ERA, finishing the 
season by making three appearances in the American League playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
He also finished a few meals outside the sanctity of his hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lucky," Finley said. "There were guys on the team who really looked out 
for me. Kirk (McCaskill) and Ron Romanick, they were always around to make sure 
nothing would go wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Gradually, Finley got acclimated to the life style. Major league hitters took a 
little longer. Finley's development was mostly arrested in 1987, his duty 
usually restricted to mopping up after blowouts. Finley went 2-7 and the Angels 
went 4-31 during games in which Finley pitched. 
</P>
<P>
Then he went 9-15 as a starter in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Finley was beginning to find himself cast as a pitcher who didn't know how to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"That number (4-31) looks real bad," Finley said, "but I'd be coming into games 
we were already losing, 7-2. I'd pitch four shutout innings and we'd end up 
losing, 7-6. I'd have nothing to show for it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Angel pitching coach Marcel Lachemann: "He was in there, just trying to 
get experience. It was designed for him to be in those situations. He was 
learning. Game on the line were other people's responsibility at the time." 
</P>
<P>
Finley survived that, too. As he puts it, "That's over and done with. I'm on to 
bigger and better things." 
</P>
<P>
Such as? 
</P>
<P>
"I predicted 17 wins in spring training," he said. "Last year, I predicted 13 
to 15 wins -- I just had the 15 on the wrong end. 
</P>
<P>
"But I felt I could have won a lot of those games I lost. I just felt with a 
little more luck than last year, more experience and a new pitch, 16, 17, 18 
wins would be realistic." 
</P>
<P>
Toward that end, Finley offered the rest of the American League the same advice 
he has given his parents back home in West Monroe: 
</P>
<P>
Stay tuned.

FITTIPALDI WINS 200 WHILE RUNNING ON EMPTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What Emerson Fittipaldi didn't know didn't hurt him. 
</P>
<P>
Fittipaldi did not know how close the Patrick Racing team was cutting it on 
fuel as he drove to victory in the Budweiser-G.I. Joe 200 Indy car race Sunday 
at Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
"We have an onboard readout, but the reading is how much (fuel) I'm consuming," 
Fittipaldi said. "I didn't know how much they put in the car on the last stop 
or how much I had left. 
</P>
<P>
"I just know they kept saying, 'Save fuel, save fuel.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian took the checkered flag for his second straight victory and third 
in the last four starts just moments before the Chevrolet Indy V8 engine in his 
Penske PC18 stalled -- out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
Fittipaldi led for 62 of the 104 laps on the 1.922-mile, nine-turn road course, 
including the final 34. He managed to avoid a variety of troubles that plagued 
many in the 26-car field. 
</P>
<P>
Fittipaldi, who started his hot streak with a victory in the Indianapolis 500 
last month, also won the Detroit Grand Prix last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
His car crossed the finish line in Portland 20.36 seconds -- about one-third of 
a lap -- ahead of the Lola-Cosworth of two-time CART-PPG champion Bobby Rahal. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran hard but we were by no means the fastest thing in a straight line," 
Rahal said. "We couldn't stay with the Chevys on the straightaways but we were 
running better than they were in the turns. We just had to run hard every lap." 
</P>
<P>
After Fittipaldi ran out of fuel, he wound up hitching a ride on the sidepod of 
Rahal's car. 
</P>
<P>
Arie Luyendyk of the Netherlands was third, the last competitor on the lead 
lap, followed by Teo Fabi of Italy and Scott Pruett, both one lap behind, and 
Michael Andretti, two laps back. 
</P>
<P>
Fittipaldi, who averaged 103.98 m.p.h., took sole possession of the series 
point lead, breaking a tie for with Rick Mears, who finished eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Elliott, winningest active NASCAR Winston Cup driver at Michigan 
International Speedway, beat Rusty Wallace by 1.99 seconds for his first win of 
the season in the Miller 400 at Brooklyn, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, who averaged 139.023 m.p.h., earned $71,450 for the victory, the 
seventh of his career on the high-banked two-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
The race, run in 85-degree temperatures, came down to an 11-lap sprint between 
Elliott's Ford Thunderbird, Wallace's Pontiac Grand Prix and Darrell Waltrip's 
Chevrolet Lumina. 
</P>
<P>
Waltrip had a big lead, but Elliott began moving up fast, taking second place 
with nine laps remaining and passing Waltrip coming out of the fourth turn to 
lead with seven laps left. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott pulled steadily away from the pack. Wallace moved around Waltrip on the 
third turn with two laps left and finished second. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984 and '86, Elliott also came to Michigan looking for his first win of the 
season and he won both times. It was the 30th career victory in 275 starts for 
Elliott, who won the Winston Cup title last season.

Jean Louis Schlesser of France and Jochen Mass of West Germany, driving a 
Sauber Mercedes, won the world sports prototype championship race at Madrid,

FAIRFAX, WASHINGTON WIN BASKETBALL TITLES AS L.A. GAMES END 
</P>

There certainly were taller teams than the Fairfax High School boy's basketball 
team. There were even stronger teams, faster teams and flashier teams. 
</P>
<P>
But over the course of a 128-team tournament at the L.A. Games, no team was 
better. 
</P>
<P>
Fairfax defeated Dorsey, 46-45, in Sunday's final at El Camino College behind 
11 points by Ryan Hickman, who was named the tournament's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
The Lions defeated two-time defending champion Cleveland on Saturday to advance 
to Sunday morning's semifinals against Fremont, which was playing with all its 
starters from the L.A. City 3-A championship team. 
</P>
<P>
Fairfax held Fremont to 11 points in the first 31 minutes of the 40-minute 
game, and won, 34-22. 
</P>
<P>
Fairfax relied on a stifling man-to-man defense and precision passing to win 
the championship of the L.A. Games, a 12-sport festival for 10,000 Southern 
California high school athletes that concluded Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we could show flashiness, but we like a controlled flashiness," 
Fairfax Coach Harvey Kitani said. "Our type of play demands a lot of focus and 
concentration. It's like the kid in the classroom who is going to Harvard and 
can never daydream." 
</P>
<P>
In the girls' competition, Washington won four of its six games by more than 20 
points, and Sunday defeated much-taller Morningside for the championship, 
70-56. 
</P>
<P>
In a game that was called with 41 seconds to play because of a bench-clearing 
fight, Washington finally defeated Morningside, the state champion which had 
defeated the Generals twice last season. 
</P>
<P>
Despite losing their tallest player, 5-foot-11 Angelina Adams, because of a 
knee injury, Washington dominated the Monarchs with 6-5 Lisa Leslie, 6-3 Janet 
Davis and 6-1 Rachel Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
"They were like enormous," said Washington's Charisse Sampson, who scored 19 
points and was named tournament MVP. "But I was just telling myself to go for 
it, to take charge. This was revenge time." 
</P>
<P>
The Generals also were led by Remitha Houston and Detra Lockhart, who 
Washington Coach Phil Chase calls the country's best high school backcourt 
tandem. 
</P>
<P>
Houston scored a game-high 21 points and Lockhart had 23 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Tempers flared with two minutes left when Leslie threw an elbow at the 5-10 
Sampson, and was called for a foul. She then threw the ball at a referee, who 
caught it and called a technical. 
</P>
<P>
The game was called with less than a minute to play after two players got into 
a fight on the court, prompting both benches to clear.

WILLIAMS KNOCKS BOBBY CZYZ RIGHT INTO RETIREMENT

Charles Williams and Bobby Czyz both proved points to themselves Sunday in 10 
furious rounds that resulted in Williams keeping the International Boxing 
Federation light-heavyweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to prove to the world I'm the No. 1 light-heavyweight in the world," 
Williams said, "and I think I did. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I won the championship, I haven't gotten the credit I deserve. I'm kind 
of known as the unknown champion. I think the phone will be ringing off the 
hook for me to fight." 
</P>
<P>
Czyz, 27, a professional since 1980, proved to himself that it is indeed time 
to retire. 
</P>
<P>
The fight ended with Czyz, his left eye almost closed, sitting on his stool 
after the 10th round, unwilling to continue. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect it's time for me to call it quits, at least in this capacity," Czyz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams began to turn the fight in his favor in the sixth round, and he 
knocked Czyz down twice in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
The boxers both threw right-handed punches, but Williams caught Czyz flush on 
the jaw. Czyz caught himself before he fell but then reeled across the ring and 
went down. He was up at six and took a mandatory eight-count. 
</P>
<P>
Badly hurt, he went down again from a grazing right hand, then got up at five. 
</P>
<P>
Czyz tried to rally in the ninth round, but Williams had him in trouble with 
some sharp punches to the head, and at the end of the 10th, Czyz was exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
The only way Czyz could have won this rematch was by knockout, and it was 
obvious he did not have the strength or the firepower to do it in the late 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 172 1/2, of Mansfield, Ohio, took the IBF title by stopping Czyz, 
175, of Wanaque, N.J., after nine rounds on Oct. 29, 1987, at Las Vegas. Czyz's 
right eye was closed in that fight. 
</P>
<P>
One judge had Williams ahead by nine points, another by seven and the third by 
six. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, 27, making his third defense, has a 27-4-2 record with 19 knockouts. 
Czyz is 30-5-4 with 24 knockouts.

Yugoslav basketball star Drazen Petrovic, considered the best guard in Europe, 
said he might join the Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
Petrovic, 25, who plays for Real Madrid, said after the European Basketball 
championships at Zagreb, Yugoslavia, that Portland was willing to "buy the 
rest" of his contract from the Spanish team. 
</P>
<P>
After last year's Seoul Olympics, where Yugoslavia lost to the Soviet Union in 
the final, Petrovic signed a four-year contract with Real Madrid, reportedly 
for $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-5 Petrovic scored 28 points to lead Yugoslavia to a 98-77 victory 
over defending champion Greece in the European final.

DOUGHNUT MAKER FEELS RIVALS' BITE; 
</P>
<P>
CHAIN SUFFERS MANY MANAGEMENT CHANGES, ENCROACHMENT BY INDEPENDENTS

<P>
When the urge for a doughnut would strike, Ed Garza used to drive off to the 
nearest Winchell's Donut House. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with doughnuts being sold in nearly every mini-mall and corner convenience 
store, Garza, a Pasadena medical products salesman, says he can be more choosy. 
His current favorite: Big Mama's, a shop in Highland Park where the doughnuts 
are "bigger and better" than Winchell's, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I go to Winchell's less because of all the other doughnut places," Garza said. 
</P>
<P>
Winchell's Donut Houses have been shaken by the loss of customers such as 
Garza, who have taken their appetites for jelly doughnuts and bear claws 
elsewhere. The once robust Winchell's chain -- its yellow-and-brown signs a 
common Southern California sight -- has been beset by management mistakes and 
hordes of new rivals, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
Winchell's, the nation's second-largest chain behind Dunkin Donuts, has lost 
money two years in a row, and store sales have kept falling despite recent 
attempts to turn the 650-shop chain around. Last year, Winchell's lost $12.8 
million on sales of $145 million. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, La Mirada-based Winchell's officials, who declined to be 
interviewed for this story, said they were considering selling the chain. 
Winchell's is 42% owned by the Denny's coffee shop chain, which in turn is 
owned by New York-based TW Services. TW has agreed to be acquired by an 
investment group. 
</P>
<P>
"The name has been allowed to deteriorate," said Ward Lindenmayer, a San 
Francisco-based retail analyst who used to follow Winchell's. "They have been 
allowed to get sloppy and dirty. There isn't a whole lot of things going for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Competing doughnut operators have watched the decline of Winchell's and the 
numerous changes in top management -- four presidents in the past five years -- 
and ownership. 
</P>
<P>
"They keep changing hands and that's hard on the person who's making a living 
in the store," said Joe Apodaca, who has operated Georgia's doughnuts in South 
Central Los Angeles for nearly 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, many Winchell stores had gone years without remodeling and were 
often staffed by a single person for most of the day and at night. Low-paid 
managers had little incentive to provide the high level of customer service 
many in the industry say is necessary to compete effectively. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they have been hurt very badly over the years," said one doughnut 
chain operator. "They don't have the fine reputation today that they used to 
have." 
</P>
<P>
The chain is the namesake of Verne H. Winchell, who opened the first shop in 
Temple City in 1948, after trying his hand at selling used cars and jukeboxes. 
</P>
<P>
After a rocky start, the chain blossomed. In 1968, Denny's purchased the then 
200-store operation in return for stock, and Winchell became chairman of the 
coffee shop chain until 1980. 
</P>
<P>
When Denny's was converted into a privately owned firm in 1984, Winchell 
received about $51 million for his shares -- the fruit of the $27,000 he 
invested in the first Winchell's store four decades earlier. Winchell could not 
be reached for comment for this story. 
</P>
<P>
Under Denny's, Winchell's grew rapidly. The number of stores reached nearly 
1,000 by the late 1970s, and Winchell's soon opened in Japan and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Winchell's also took another fateful step under Denny's -- in 1971, it bought 
out its franchisees and converted all outlets to company-owned stores. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a huge mistake," said Lindenmayer. "You couldn't pay enough to motivate 
the store employees. It's not a prestigious job and it's monotonous. The only 
incentive you have is if you own it." 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Boston-based Dunkin Donuts, with more than 1,786 stores 
nationwide, is almost entirely operated by franchisees. The chain, which is 
fighting a takeover launched by two Canadian firms, has seen sales and profits 
grow steadily during the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Besides unmotivated store managers, Winchell's also suffered from disinterested 
executives at Denny's after Verne Winchell departed, Lindenmayer says. The 
executives saw little need to put money into a sluggish doughnut chain. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Winchell's faced growing numbers of competitors, including in-house 
bakeries at supermarkets, convenience stores and the countless numbers of 
mom-and-pop shops that seem to inhabit every Los Angeles mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden you got hundreds if not thousands of outlets selling 
doughnuts," Lindenmayer. "It's convenient to buy doughnuts at Safeway if you 
are there already." 
</P>
<P>
Winchell's has fought back with the introduction of creme-filled croissants and 
in-store ovens to bake muffins. The chain has closed about 200 poorly 
performing stores and once again began selling franchises in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The company has even joined forces with competitors. Winchell's doughnuts are 
sold at more than 600 7-Eleven convenience stores in Southern and Central 
California. "We are delighted with the program," said Don Cowan, a spokesman 
for the 7-Eleven chain. "It has added incremental sales to our stores." 
</P>
<P>
But store sales at Winchell's continue to slide. Average store sales have sunk 
to $207,000 in 1988 from $217,000 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The company also faces numerous lawsuits related to its conversion to a 
publicly traded limited partnership in December, 1986. Investors paid $18 a 
share for Winchell's only to see the price fall below $4. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its many problems, Winchell's large network of stores in California has 
drawn interest. Dunkin Donuts, which has only a handful of stores in 
California, says it might be interested in parts of the chain but is not saying 
whether it is looking to put forward a bid. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur S. Pfefferman, chairman of Woodland Hills-based Donut Inn, a 32-store 
chain, said he is putting together a bid for Winchell's. "The network of stores 
is attractive," Pfefferman said. "But they have many locations that we would 
not approve." 
</P>
<P>
Pfefferman is also counting on a loyal corps of Winchell's customers who have 
grown up with Winchell's. 
</P>
<P>
"Winchell's is an institution," said Octavio Lopez, 36, after his daily morning 
stop at one of the chain's shops in Glendale. "When somebody asks 'Where do you 
want to go have a doughnut?,' hell, I go to Winchell's."

CRISIS IN CHINA HAS HONG KONG INVESTORS LOOKING TO SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, many Hong Kong-owned companies have been reluctant to invest large 
sums in Southern California or elsewhere in the United States, seeing 
investment returns back home in the colony as superior and fearing being 
labeled as unpatriotic. But the recent violence and unrest in China is making 
those few Hong Kong companies that have invested large sums here feel somewhat 
vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
Take International Landmark Group. The company, which years ago began 
developing shopping and housing projects in Los Angeles' Chinatown and Monterey 
Park, is working on new residential and shopping complexes in Los Angeles and 
Oakland. Other purchases under study or negotiation: a U.S. real estate holding 
company, a West Coast financial institution and a five-star New York hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been diversifying in the U.S. and in other countries in the last 10 
years, way before the latest Chinese incidents," says Joseph M. Chan, president 
and chief executive of International Landmark. "But the recent incidents in 
China confirmed we have made a wise choice, and we will continue to diversify 
as planned." 
</P>
<P>
Chan adds that a friend in Hong Kong who runs a large garment manufacturing 
firm is looking to acquire or set up some manufacturing operations in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
These and other examples add up to expectations of a growing presense of Hong 
Kong companies and individual investors in Southern California in the wake of 
the recent Beijing massacres and subsequent Chinese government crackdown on 
dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
Some Hong Kong companies and investors began buying Southern California real 
estate or setting up businesses here years ago, long before the 1984 agreement 
by Great Britain to turn over the colony to China, or before the unrest in 
China. But many others have been reluctant to enter the market here, in part 
because the Hong Kong economy was booming and because investing here would have 
been seen as a sign of a lack of confidence in the colony's future. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attitude Changed 
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese unrest -- coming along with Hong Kong's rising labor costs, a 
"brain drain" of talented people out of the colony and attractive prices in the 
United States -- has caused a change in attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about China already have resulted in an initial spurt of capital 
flight from Hong Kong into Southern California in the form of savings deposits 
and other cash investments, bankers report. 
</P>
<P>
Investments in real estate and new business ventures by nature will take longer 
to develop, partly because it may take awhile for Hong Kong firms and investors 
to get money freed up. With Hong Kong real estate prices plummeting 20% to 25% 
since the Beijing massacres, many prospective real estate sellers are finding 
few buyers. 
</P>
<P>
But in the coming months and years, local experts expect more Hong Kong firms 
in such industries as garment manufacturing and trade to set up manufacturing, 
sales and distribution branches here. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate investments by Hong Kong investors -- until now relatively small 
and generally not involving glamorous, high-profile "trophy" properties -- may 
become larger and more noticeable. And they will be increasingly outside 
communities with large Chinese populations, such as Chinatown or Monterey Park, 
which Hong Kong investors initially favored. 
</P>
<P>
"We are beginning to see loan requests from people in Hong Kong to purchase 
property in California," says Dunson Cheng, president of Los Angeles-based 
Cathay Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of my friends are coming to L.A." to look for acquisitions, says Y. Y. 
Chan, a Chinese-American businessman in Los Angeles who serves on a California 
state advisory panel that encourages greater Asian investment here. One such 
Hong Kong friend, Chan notes, visited Southern California this month looking to 
spend $5 million on a shopping center, possibly in Los Angeles, Orange or San 
Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Didn't Trust Pact 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, not all Hong Kong investors think the upheaval in China has really 
changed things all that much and that the colony's economy will recover from 
the initial shock of the Beijing massacres. 
</P>
<P>
"People in China never trusted the agreement between China and Britain anyway," 
contended Joseph Poon, vice president of Taico Properties, a Los Angeles 
subsidiary of Tai Cheung Properties, a Hong Kong hotel and real estate firm. 
Taico has developed several housing, office and industrial projects throughout 
Southern California, and the latest events in China won't affect its plans for 
others a great deal, Poon says. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll just keep doing the same thing we've been doing," Poon says. "I don't 
detect a knee-jerk reaction from the home office." 
</P>
<P>
But for others, latent fears that China may renege on its agreement to preserve 
the free-wheeling capitalist system in Hong Kong after it takes over the colony 
in 1997 are far more real. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong was the largest foreign investor in China, but many from the colony 
now see the Chinese market as less attractive from a pure economic standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing operations in Guangdong Province in southern China, attractive to 
Hong Kong firms because of dirt-cheap labor and reliable production, suddenly 
seem more risky. Possible labor unrest or political instability could 
jeopardize tight production schedules, says Frederick M. Chan, president of Nu 
West Cos., a Los Angeles-based real estate firm that in recent days has had 
discussions with Hong Kong investors about possible joint ventures in Southern 
California real estate. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong also seems less attractive, with experts there predicting an end to 
the real estate boom while an annual exodus of about 45,000 residents has 
created shortages of talented workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Now Must Diversify 
</P>
<P>
Thus, some of the investment that would have gone into Hong Kong or China may 
begin to flow into Southeast Asia, South America, Australia, Canada, Mexico and 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong investors in the past had not expressed a strong interest in the 
U.S. because the returns in Hong Kong were so good," Frederick Chan says. "But 
now they feel they have to diversify." 
</P>
<P>
Investment here from Hong Kong is still expected to trail that from Japan, 
South Korea and Taiwan, which have bigger economies and more investment money 
to bring here. 
</P>
<P>
And Southern California is not the No. 1 choice for Hong Kong investment in 
North America. That distinction belongs to Vancouver, because Canada offers 
more favorable tax treatment to foreigners and allows Hong Kong nationals to 
gain immigration visas and eventual citizenship if they invest minimal levels 
into job-creating activities. Such investment has triggered a real estate boom 
in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
Other Hong Kong natives still prefer investing in the San Francisco Bay Area 
because of its large Chinese-American community. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Hong Kong investors are finding Southern California attractive for 
several reasons. 
</P>
<P>
One is the fast growth of the market here, which is gaining over San Francisco 
as the U.S. gateway to the Pacific Rim. Hong Kong is the fourth-largest trading 
partner with the Los Angeles area, with slightly less than $4 billion in goods 
from the British colony flowing through Los Angeles ports and customs 
facilities last year, according to the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. 
That trailed Japan's $31 billion, Taiwan's $10.6 billion and South Korea's 
$10.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"In many ways, the Los Angeles area is like Hong Kong because we've been 
growing like crazy," says Jack Kyser, chief economist for the chamber, which 
lists at least 75 to 100 Hong Kong companies or subsidiaries operating in the 
Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Way to Skirt Quotas 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong businesses also are attracted by the large Asian population here and 
by the large presense here of industries they are familiar with, such as 
apparel, electronics and toy wholesaling, Kyser says. 
</P>
<P>
Some Hong Kong clothing manufacturers see the need to set up U.S. production 
facilities to overcome U.S. textile quotas that limit garment imports, says Y. 
Y. Chan, the local businessman encouraging greater Asian investment here. Also, 
he contends, while labor in Hong Kong and China is cheaper relative to that 
here and there are fewer labor laws and regulations in Asia, manufacturing in 
the United States can ensure quicker delivery into the market and, in some 
cases, greater quality control. Also, Chan says, land here is cheap compared to 
that in Hong Kong and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, many of the younger generation of Hong Kong businessmen have 
studied in Southern California, are more sophisticated in Western ways and have 
friends here. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the investment so far has been focused on real estate, the preferred 
investment for many Hong Kong nationals because of its security and permanence. 
Total Hong Kong real estate investment here is difficult to measure, in part 
because investors from the colony often buy through corporations, banks or 
other entities that obscure the true identity of their owners. Many Hong Kong 
investors prefer to remain low-key, generally avoiding publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong investment here also is difficult to measure because investors have 
largely shied away from buying high-profile trophy properties such as large 
downtown skyscrapers or posh hotels. A survey last year by the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology Center for Real Estate Development failed to find a 
single major downtown Los Angeles building owned by Hong Kong interests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Value-Oriented 
</P>
<P>
One notable exception to this hesitancy to buy trophy properties was the 
$100-million 1985 purchase of the Beverly Wilshire Hotel by the Regent hotel 
firm of Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong investors have been unwilling to pay the premiums that the Japanese 
pay in order to acquire trophy properties. They've been more value-oriented 
investors," says Clifton K. Chang, a partner at Altair Investment Co., a Los 
Angeles real estate firm that works with Hong Kong investors to find 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Hong Kong investors have started by buying single-family homes, small 
shopping centers, medical centers, apartment complexes or other developments, 
often in the $1-million to $10-million range and often in Chinatown, Monterey 
Park or other communities with high Asian populations, says Randal J. Lee, 
president of Lilly Enterprises Inc., a Los Angeles real estate brokerage and 
property-management concern. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong investors own, built or have proposed at least five shopping malls, 
office or residential developments in Los Angeles' Chinatown, according to 
Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co., a Los Angeles accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
But now, some investors who have been here awhile and have learned the ropes 
are beginning to set their sights on bigger acquisitions -- and have the 
financial wherewithal to pull them off, experts say. And other large investors 
that previously shied away from this market are taking a second look. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more aggressive of this new breed is International Landmark Group, 
the Los Angeles-based subsidiary of Park Lane International, a Hong Kong 
conglomerate that operates the Park Lane Hotel chain. 
</P>
<P>
The firm started in the United States by investing in Chinatown and other 
Chinese-American centers, says Joseph Chan, chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Has Branched Out 
</P>
<P>
Plans include building a 100,000-plus square-foot shopping center at Hill and 
Ord streets in Chinatown, across the street from another shopping mall the firm 
is renovating. International Landmark is also developing a $250-million retail, 
residential and office complex in Oakland Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
But the firm has also branched out beyond Chinese-American communities. It was 
one of the first Hong Kong firms to develop a U.S. hotel from scratch, when it 
completed in 1984 the Park 55 Hotel in San Francisco, formerly called the 
Ramada Renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
Now, more than half of the parent firm's portfolio is diversified outside Hong 
Kong in Australia, Canada, the United States and elsewhere, Chan says. Five 
years ago, the degree of diversification was less than half. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's gone through a learning experience," Chan says. "At first it's a 
little safer to stay in your back yard, which is Chinese, and when you 
understand the market better, you can then reach out to other markets. We like 
to think we understand the market a little bit better than we used to." 
</P>
<P>
Chan says the firm has identified a real estate holding company it wishes to 
negotiate to purchase as a way of acquiring a group of properties in one swoop. 
Plans to buy a bank or savings and loan, preferably on the West Coast, will be 
a natural complement to the firm's real estate activities, Chan says. 
</P>
<P>
The firm also expects to complete its acquisition of an as-yet unnamed 
five-star hotel in New York in a couple of months. 
</P>
<P>
"People in Hong Kong will buy trophy things, but not necessarily at the extreme 
high prices" paid by the Japanese, Chan says. The New York hotel, he says, "is 
somewhat of a trophy property, but we're not paying a trophy price."

FOOTNOTES: GLOBAL SCAVENGER HUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jonathan Bassan is looking for a few hardy travelers to join the Human Race. 
It'll only cost them $5,300. 
</P>
<P>
In a business person's version of "Around the World in 80 Days," the volunteers 
will compete to be first to circle the globe while stopping here and there to 
mug for a photograph and shop. First prize: $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bassan says seven two-person teams have signed up for the global scavenger 
hunt, and he wants 30 more to follow. On Oct. 28, they'll gather at his office 
in Montecito to receive a rough itinerary. The object is to then plot a course 
to such spots as Hong Kong, Singapore and Israel -- and return with such things 
as casino chips. 
</P>
<P>
The fee covers only air fare and hotels, but Bassan said he's praying only to 
break even. Who has inquired? "The primary factor," says the former investor 
and art importer, "is who has the ability to take off for four weeks. It's the 
real estate developers and people who have their own businesses, even if it's 
someone who sells log cabin kits in Montana." 
</P>
<P>
It's Like Hiring Perry Mason 
</P>
<P>
During the Iran-Contra hearings two years ago, the craggy face of the Senate's 
attorney, New York lawyer Arthur Liman, was seen again and again by tens of 
millions of television viewers. Judging by prospective jurors in a major Los 
Angeles Superior Court case, the impression was lasting. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for stockholders suing 11 Walt Disney Co. directors and corporate 
raider Saul Steinberg in a 5-year-old "greenmail" suit asked a panel of juror 
candidates late last week if they saw a familiar face in court. About a third 
of the 24 members of the jury panel raised hands and pointed out Liman among 
the defense attorneys. They said they had seen his face on TV but didn't know 
his name. 
</P>
<P>
Liman will soon become more than a face in the crowd. As chief attorney for 
Steinberg, he will make an opening statement to the jury today. 
</P>
<P>
The Ultimate Fuzz Buster 
</P>
<P>
Speeders wanting to evade police radar guns may have a new weapon at their 
disposal -- a stealth car. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler is planning to introduce a new automobile in the next few years called 
the Stealth, a name derived from Northrop's B-2 bomber. Whether it will sport a 
radar-eluding shape like the jet's unusual all-wing design is unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Honda, the Japanese auto maker, gained notoriety last year for a television 
advertisement featuring a mock-up of the bomber. Said a Chrysler official: "We 
wouldn't want Honda to beat us to it." 
</P>
<P>
For its part, Northrop doesn't seem too concerned. The company does not own a 
trademark on stealth. "It's just a descriptive word," a company spokesman said. 
"It is not really a name." 
</P>
<P>
Let Fingers Do the Talking 
</P>
<P>
Budding entrepreneurs with big egos but little office staff can take heart: 
Switchboard operators now come in a box. 
</P>
<P>
The $350 Tele-Receptionist, sold by News Media Services of Los Angeles, is an 
electronic phone system that uses a digitally synthesized voice to interact 
with callers. A computer chip in the answering machine-sized device holds 35 
phrases of your choice. Among those recommended by the maker to impress your 
clients: "Sorry, would you repeat the number?" or "One moment, please, and I'll 
connect you." 
</P>
<P>
The machine greets a caller, then holds the line. You can then either answer or 
put the box of switches to work by tapping in the codes that correspond with 
the spoken phrases you want the machine to use. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, you must be in your office to make it all work, however. When a 
Times reporter called the gentleman who sells the Tele-Receptionist, a 
prerecorded male voice said only that all calls would be returned promptly.

TIMES WANTS NEW IMAGE IN AD CAMPAIGN; 
</P>
<P>
REVIEW COULD LEAD TO ANOTHER AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A more contemporary advertising image -- and possibly a new ad agency -- are on 
tap for the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
In a bid to present a more up-to-date image and to boost circulation, The 
Times, which spends about $5 million each year to advertise and promote itself, 
has begun an agency review. The current ad agency, J. Walter Thompson, is still 
in the running, but several other agencies, including BBDO/Los Angeles, have 
made presentations to Times officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking to see if there's a way to energize our advertising and build 
circulation," said Don Clark, executive vice president of marketing. Clark said 
The Times plans to break a more upbeat campaign -- with a strong Southern 
California theme -- in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
The new campaign is expected to focus on some of the recent changes that have 
taken place at The Times. Changes include the redesigned Real Estate and Sunday 
Calendar sections, addition of color photographs to the front page and 
introduction of several new columns and the new P.M. Final. 
</P>
<P>
To spur circulation, The Times plans to offer special discount prices to new 
subscribers in some areas this fall -- a rarity for the paper. The Times will 
rely heavily on direct response advertising for this circulation drive -- both 
through the mail and also with the use of TV commercials that provide toll-free 
phone numbers, said Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Also, The Times recently hired a Los Angeles specialty company, Edge Films, to 
create new ads shown before movies at theaters. Clark said the new ads will be 
more entertaining and have the theme line, "Southern California -- where 
anything is possible." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot more to the Los Angeles Times than the 'gray lady,' " said 
Jeffrey S. Hall, vice president of marketing services, referring to the blur of 
black print on white paper. "The paper is more engaging and more compelling, 
and we want to get that message across."

Five Convicted in Bank Theft: A federal jury convicted five men of stealing 
nearly $70 million through electronic transfers from First National Bank of 
Chicago to banks in Vienna. Armand Moore, Otis Wilson, Neal Jackson, Ronald 
Carson and Leonard Strickland were convicted in the May, 1986, wire transfer of 
$69,125,000 from three First National accounts to banks in Austria in what 
prosecutors said was a near-perfect crime.

Helmsley Trial to Begin: Leona Helmsley, who heads a $5-billion real estate and 
hotel empire with her husband Harry, is scheduled to go on trial for tax 
evasion today. The Helmsleys are believed to be one of the wealthiest couples 
in the world with holdings that include the Empire State Building and the 
Helmsley Palace Hotel. Leona Helmsley was indicted for evading $4 million in 
income taxes by claiming personal luxuries and gifts as tax-deductible business 
expenses. She is also charged with extorting kickbacks from suppliers and 
contractors. If convicted, she faces a maximum sentence of more than 100 years 
in prison and millions of dollars in fines. Jury selection is expected to take 
a week; opening arguments are scheduled for July 5.

Stakes Raised in Bid for British Firm: A U.S. partnership led by investment 
bank Wasserstein Perella &amp; Co. raised its takeover bid in a hotly contested 
battle for Gateway Corp., Britain's third-largest supermarket chain. The higher 
bid was endorsed by the company and appeared to give the U.S. bidders an edge 
in the contest against rival Isosceles PLC, a British investor group that has 
bid $3.60 a share. Wasserstein Perella and West German-controlled Great 
Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. offered to pay $3.70 a share for Gateway. If 
successful, the deal, worth more than $3 billion, would be Europe's biggest 
leveraged buyout.

JACK SMITH: BETWEEN HARD ROCK CAFE AND A PRETTY PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We flew up to San Francisco with our friends Rita and Morry Pynoos for our 
anniversary weekend. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I had spent a night or two in San Francisco during the war, but 
that was before credit cards, and we were very parsimonious. 
</P>
<P>
Like almost every other outbound serviceman, I did take my wife to the Top of 
the Mark for a final drink before I sailed for the South Pacific. The Top of 
the Mark was the true jumping off place for the Pacific war. 
</P>
<P>
This time we stayed at the Mark Hopkins, looking down on the glorious view 
which, though much has changed for the worse since the war, is still one of the 
world's prettiest. 
</P>
<P>
As Robert A. Jones noted in his column the other day, there is no longer any 
contest between San Francisco and Los Angeles. San Francisco is a victim of its 
own narcissism. San Francisco turned to the past and ignored the future. Now 
that future belongs to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
All the same, it's a nice place to visit. From our room we looked down on that 
imposing brownstone anachronism, the Pacific Union Club. Nothing has changed 
about it in 50 years, that I know of, except that the entrance is covered by 
more vines. It supposedly has a membership of 300 of San Francisco's richest 
men -- the heirs of Crocker, Stanford, Huntington and Hopkins -- but I have 
never seen anyone enter or leave it. I have never seen a face in a window. 
</P>
<P>
Below it lay a pretty little windswept park with stoic women lying about in 
bikinis, and a block beyond that the gray Gothic facade of Grace Cathedral. Out 
on the gray-green bay, half hidden by one of the new towers, lay Alcatraz 
Island with its bone-white prison ruins. One red tower of the Golden Gate 
Bridge arose, only partly blocked, in graceful strength. One wonders why anyone 
would ever have tried to escape a place with the view that Alcatraz must have 
had. Below us the pretty colored banners hanging from the facade of the 
Fairmont snapped in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
For lunch we took a cab to the Hard Rock Cafe, at Van Ness and Sacramento. 
"Hard Rock Cafe?" the taxi driver said with disgust. "Forty airports go out 
ahead of me and I get the Hard Rock Cafe." 
</P>
<P>
Morry commiserated that maybe his next fare would be to the airport. "No way," 
the driver said. "I get back, 40 more airports will go ahead of me. I'll get 
another Hard Rock Cafe." 
</P>
<P>
He said it wasn't all bad, though. "I've been to Sacramento. I've been to the 
Oregon border. I pick up this little lady, she wants me to run her here, there. 
I do her a few favors, run a few errands. She likes me. She says she's going 
out of town. She says she wants me to stay in her condominium. She has this $1 
million condo. She gives me the key. She says, 'I want you to drive my BMW 
while I'm gone.' Listen, you think this is some rich old lady? Right? Look at 
this." 
</P>
<P>
He whipped out a photograph of a good-looking young blonde. She looked 
familiar. The photograph was a standard 8x10 studio glossy. Oh, well, San 
Francisco is a city of fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
Like its namesake in Beverly Hills, the Hard Rock had a long line of young 
people waiting to buy souvenirs at its doorway store. We had reservations and 
were soon seated. Being somewhat over 20, I don't know the reason for the Hard 
Rock cafes' success. They are always packed. The decor is early Elvis. The 
sound is hard rock. The noise level probably deafens employees in one or two 
years. But there is a sense of excitement about the place, and the food is 
excellent. Unless you are just out of high school, almost everyone in the cafe 
will be of another generation. 
</P>
<P>
I couldn't get a fix on San Francisco because I imagine most of the customers 
were from someplace else -- probably Los Angeles. T-shirts. Jeans. Shorts. 
Miniskirts. Sweat shirts. Reeboks. In the daytime in the tourist areas you are 
not likely to encounter any true San Franciscans. They have simply abandoned 
the city to the tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Going back, our cab driver was Nigerian. He wasn't talkative. We asked him how 
Nigeria was different from San Francisco. He thought a moment. 
</P>
<P>
"Warmer," he said.

FADS; 
</P>
<P>
THEY'RE SILLY AND UNPREDICTABLE, AND CALIFORNIANS JUST CAN'T SEEM TO GET ENOUGH 
OF THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Fads were the subject: Will Batmania sweep Los Angeles this summer? What will 
be the Hula Hoop of the '90s, the Pet Rock of the now generation? Ken Hakuta, 
a.k.a. "Dr. Fad," the man who sold 225 million Wacky Wallwalkers, pondered the 
question for the briefest moment. "In Los Angeles," he said, "the word fad is 
kind of redundant." 
</P>
<P>
Hakuta, who lives in Washington -- very comfortably, having made $20 million on 
his 1983 super-fad, an eight-legged rubber crawly that crept down the wall, is 
sure of one thing: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Strangeness in Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
"People in Los Angeles are more used to acting silly than other people. In 
California, you want to have the strangest thing, be doing the strangest thing. 
People admire that." 
</P>
<P>
It's not that most fads originate in California, he observed, but California is 
"the great incubator of fads. Fads get hot in California. A good idea can come 
from Des Moines, but it's not going to be anything there. Then it'll hit Venice 
Beach or Westwood and go all around the country, back to Des Moines." 
</P>
<P>
Hot weather is prime fad weather, Hakuta observed -- "in warm weather, people 
are sillier" -- and this summer's hottest fad just could be . . . 
</P>
<P>
The skateboard. 
</P>
<P>
The skateboard? "I think it's going to get really, really hot, it's going to 
become a really major league sport, with major prize money. And Los Angeles is 
a mecca of skateboarding. It's a life-style sport. In a way, it's like a video 
game, back and forth, back and forth. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But on the whole, said the author of "How to Create Your Own Fad and Make a 
Million Dollars": "I've been very bored with a lot of other things I see. To 
tell you the truth, we've gone through a big dry spell of fads." 
</P>
<P>
Grazing and channeling, baby-on-board and Garfield-in-the-window 
notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, concluded Hakuta, who hopes to shift his Fad Fair from the East 
Coast to Los Angeles this December, "it's really pretty dull." 
</P>
<P>
It's not that the crazy, creative people aren't out there. It's just that their 
ideas aren't exactly the pogo sticks of tomorrow. Consider these, recently 
brought to "Dr. Fad," who dispenses free wisdom to would-be entrepreneurs of 
the ridiculous: 
</P>
<P>
A plaster of Paris sculpture called "The Hail Mary Pass," depicting the Virgin 
Mary throwing the last-ditch pass made famous by quarterback Doug Flutie. 
Celebrity dirt (spaded up from the yards of Hollywood's rich and famous). 
Packaged L.A. smog. Marbles, as in, "all your marbles." A glow-in-the-dark 
toilet seat. A stick in the mud. Diet shampoo, for people with big egos. And 
the "Dobermask," a Styrofoam mask to prop against your window or put on your 
cat so would-be intruders will think there's a Doberman on duty. 
</P>
<P>
What is a fad, and how does it start? 
</P>
<P>
Chaytor Mason, a psychologist who is associate professor of human factors at 
USC, said: "The fad begins when we discover that there's a facet of our 
personality which has previously been unexpressed or unexpressable. The fad 
provides the means, or the excuse." Perfect examples, he said, are the vanity 
license plate and the bumper sticker. 
</P>
<P>
"Fads are all about fantasy. At propitious times in life, many of us feel the 
same way. Consequently, when somebody does something that fits our fantasies 
and needs, we suddenly find it very exciting." 
</P>
<P>
A classic, he observed, is blue jeans, which caught on in the '60s as a symbol 
of rebellion but proved to have a staying power rare to fads and, indeed, came 
to be a symbol of conformity. 
</P>
<P>
Fads, he believes, happen "pretty much by chance." Still, Mason sees one common 
denominator among super-fads: "Many have some sexual basis. Sex is very 
important." And so is price. Cheap is best. (Hakuta's Wallwalker was a $2.50 
retail item.) 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, nostalgia fuels a fad. Mason mused about the current fad for leather 
bomber jackets and suggested that "there has not been a war for quite a spell . 
. . a war which was considered an acceptable adventure." Perhaps this fashion 
expression is a wish "to be part of something great, something dangerous," he 
said, to re-live the fervor of World War II, a real war. 
</P>
<P>
Californians' current preoccupation with health and fitness has resulted in a 
food fad, what Mason sees as a perverse preoccupation with food: If it tastes 
bad, or has virtually no taste at all, it must be good for you. He sees it as a 
reversion to the "puritanical idea that if it hurts, it must be godly. I think 
we've begun to feel guilty about enjoyable things." He noted that today "if you 
put 'light' on anything, probably including even water, you can sell it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trendy Words 
</P>
<P>
There are fads in language -- including the contemporary preoccupation with 
words such as prioritize and interface and network. And there are fads in 
names, in pets, in alcoholic beverages. (Whatever happened to that all-American 
drink, rye whiskey?) 
</P>
<P>
Pigs had their day, a fad spurred possibly by the appeal of the Muppets' Miss 
Piggy. Other fads we have known and loved include: happy faces, Volkswagen 
stuffing, panty raids, flagpole sitting, mood rings, Earth shoes, Nehru 
jackets, E.T., Cabbage Patch Kids, Trivial Pursuit, Rubik's Cube and Silly 
Putty. The late '70s brought us the tanning salon. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as we edge toward the '90s, Mason is predicting "a whiteness fad," given 
impetus by the skin cancer scare. At the same time, he said, black and other 
dark colors of clothing will be in vogue, as they contrast well with a pale 
skin, as will beauty marks, real or bogus. 
</P>
<P>
But then, a fad is, by definition, a passing fancy, usually non-utilitarian, a 
marketplace meteor that soon fizzles. As Hakuta puts it, "If you come up with 
something that's useless and promote it the right way, everybody will have to 
have it yesterday, even though they get up the next morning and wonder why they 
bought it." 
</P>
<P>
Mason goes so far as to place in the fad category several items that are 
neither jokes nor useless. "Fax machines," he says, "I think that's a fad. And 
car telephones." Of the latter he says, "It's a prestige thing, the fantasy 
that I can contact the world, I am universal, I can contact George Bush and 
tell him how to run the country. I look important if I'm sitting in traffic 
telephoning somebody." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Die of Own Weight' 
</P>
<P>
Have these items peaked? "I'd say probably a few more months and they will," he 
says. "They'll die of their own weight. People won't reorder, or they'll be 
lying around gathering dust." 
</P>
<P>
He's hedging his bets, though, on Batmania, even with all the hype for 
"Batman," which opened late last week in Los Angeles. "I think the fad might 
not go too far . . . totally masculine, isolated things have a limited fad 
life." 
</P>
<P>
Most would-be fads die quietly. The common wisdom, says Melanie Wallendorf, 
associate professor of marketing at University of Arizona and co-author of 
"Consumer Behavior," is that 80% of new products fail. That figure is 
debatable, she says -- it could be high or low -- but it's safe to say that a 
huge number flop, "which means that even the most sophisticated people don't 
know what people will be fascinated with until it's in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of this is socially constructed. Children share with each other. 'Ah, 
Jimmy has a new Batman yo-yo,' then Sally wants one. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, with a new product, timing is all-important. Wallendorf observes 
that when Procter and Gamble first introduced paper diapers, "they were a flop. 
What sort of mother would put a paper diaper on her child, especially those 
mothers in the 1950s?" 
</P>
<P>
In the '60s, the disposable diaper was reintroduced, this time to a group of 
young mothers starting to flex feminist muscle. To them, Wallendorf observes, 
"using cloth diapers meant you were more home-centered." That wasn't for them. 
The disposable took off. 
</P>
<P>
Economic times are not a predictable barometer of whether a fad will take hold. 
Said Wallendorf: "We could say, 'Well, it's only in good times people have 
money to spend on stuff like this.' Maybe it's in bad times people need a 
fantasy figure" -- like Batman. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Folkes, a USC associate marketing professor, said: "If I could predict 
a fad, I wouldn't need this job. It's very hard to know what is going to 
capture the public's imagination." 
</P>
<P>
What is known, she says, is that word of mouth is the most effective marketing 
tool, together with media exposure. A fad, she said, "almost feeds on itself, 
like the Cabbage Patch doll fad. When people saw people standing in line, 
grabbing (dolls), this reinforced their idea that it was a good product." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Call Product 'New' 
</P>
<P>
One fair predictor of success for any new product is for it to have the word 
new attached to it. "A very powerful word," Folkes observes. "Americans value 
things that are new." 
</P>
<P>
The staying power of a fad often is related to the age group of its target 
market. Take adolescents, she said -- "ads blow through that group very quickly 
and die very quickly, sometimes greatly to the distress of the manufacturer." 
She mentioned the once-ubiquitous Frye boot. "The company geared up, made a lot 
of the product and suddenly adolescents decided they weren't interested in 
those boots anymore. . . . Sometimes companies don't like that their products 
are fads" as demand can disappear overnight. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of stores "really took a beating" on the Jennifer Beals "Flash Dance" 
look, ripped T-shirt and all, she said. "By the time they were able to stock 
that item, it was over with." 
</P>
<P>
Today's tie-dye could be tomorrow's puka shell necklace. 
</P>
<P>
"Fads are born to die," observes Hakuta. "In fad standard time, a day is a 
month, and a fad that lasts two months is a classic." 
</P>
<P>
But for those hoping to find the next Pet Rock, Tony Husch and Linda Foust, 
authors of "That's a Great Idea!," offer a few suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Think of a new automobile gadget. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Invent something specifically for commuters, to make those freeway hours 
more fun. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Think of a sensational name. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Forget about logic. They observe that, while most people like cola drinks 
and gelatin desserts, a cola-flavored gelatin didn't gel with consumers. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumers are unpredictable," they say. "What conventional market research 
principles could have predicted that millions of people would buy plastic tubes 
to swing around their hips or little stickers to paste on everything?" 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the creator of a new fad gets left at the starting gate. Remember 
those Baby on Board signs, the brainchild of a Bostonian? "The guy who made all 
the money was the guy who made all those Mother-in-Law in Trunk, Ex-husband on 
Roof Rack signs," Hakuta said. "That was done in California." 
</P>
<P>
For some fadsters, it's just a matter of too little, too late. Hakuta is still 
scratching his head over the fellow from Detroit who called his fad hotline 
(1-800-USA-FADS) with a terrific idea: blinking turn signals for cars. 
</P>
<P>
Hakuta himself is still searching for another Wacky Wallwalker. But he's 
philosophical, as well as rich. He said, "Most people who have had big fads 
have turned out to be just like their products, one-shot deals." 
</P>
<P>
For those thinking ahead -- way ahead -- USC's Mason is predicting: "If the 
Martians ever arrive on Earth, and if they are green, the first thing that's 
going to happen is women will have green makeup. Women are good identifiers. 
They identify with the new, the exciting, the adventurous. Eventually, the men 
would get around to it."

A HOOSIER DREAM LIFE FOR WHITTIER NATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six years ago Susan Bayh was a waitress at Bob's Big Boy and a shoe salesperson 
at Foot Locker, working two summer jobs simultaneously to pay her way through 
USC's law school. 
</P>
<P>
Now, she lives in the governor's mansion in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep pinching myself to see if this is real," said Bayh, 29, whose husband, 
Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh, 33, is the youngest governor in America. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Bayh (pronounced by), who works as a lawyer three days a week in addition 
to her duties as Indiana's First Lady, was born in 1959 in Whittier, Calif., to 
Jet Propulsion Lab engineer Robert Breshears and his wife, Carol, a newspaper, 
radio and television editor. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long before the family moved to La Canada where Susan went to St. 
Bede's Catholic School and Paradise Canyon Elementary School. An honor student 
at La Canada High School, she was a class officer for four years, cheerleader 
and volleyball champ. 
</P>
<P>
She graduated from UC Berkeley as a political science major in 1981 and picked 
up her USC law degree in 1984. A $2,000 scholarship for being named "Miss 
Southern California" in 1982 "was a big help toward my law school tuition," she 
recalled. (In 1983, as "Miss Pasadena," Bayh was a finalist for the "Miss 
California" phase of the "Miss U.S.A." beauty pageant.) 
</P>
<P>
By then she had already made the acquaintance of Birch Evans Bayh III while 
working as a summer intern for U.S. Rep. Pete Stark (D-Alameda) in Washington, 
D.C., in 1981. It took the son of the former senator from Indiana, Birch Bayh, 
"three weeks to ask me out after we met. He's a very careful guy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The courtship went on four years, mainly by phone and letters, and they were 
married April 13, 1985, at Washington Cathedral. Evan Bayh had gone to the 
Cathedral's St. Albans School from sixth through 12th grade before enrolling at 
Indiana University where he later earned his law degree. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Bayh, a Democrat, ran for his first political office, Indiana 
secretary of state, winning by 125,000 votes and spoiling a Republican sweep. 
As the youngest secretary of state in the nation, he was a chip off the old 
block. His father was minority leader of the Indiana House of Representatives 
when he was only 28 and Speaker of the House when he was 30. 
</P>
<P>
Evan Bayh decided to run for governor last year. His opponent, 57-year-old 
Republican Lt. Gov. John Mutz, had held state offices 20 years. "It was a tough 
race, a kung-fu battle," said Susan Bayh, "with Evan squeaking narrowly to 
victory by a 53% vote." 
</P>
<P>
She added that "Dan Quayle, who defeated Evan's father for the Indiana Senate 
seat in 1980, campaigned for Mutz. (Then) President Ronald Reagan and Sen. 
(Richard G.) Lugar did ads for Mutz. Evan and I campaigned all over the state 
in different directions knowing we had to go whole guns." 
</P>
<P>
With nearly all of the governor's staff no older than their 30s, youth seems a 
constant in the Bayh Administration. Susan Bayh's secretary, Cathy Clifton, is 
no exception. Only 23, she's a political science graduate from Indiana 
University. 
</P>
<P>
"I volunteered to work for the Bayh campaign for governor and was assigned to 
Mrs. Bayh last Labor Day. For the next two months, Susan and I drove to all 92 
Indiana counties putting over 20,000 miles on the car campaigning for Evan," 
Clifton said. 
</P>
<P>
"After the election, Susan said she figured if we were able to spend 14 hours a 
day for two months cooped up together in a car and got along as well as we did, 
I should do just fine as her secretary. So, she hired me." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Career in Law 
</P>
<P>
A tireless worker, Susan Bayh works as a lawyer three days a week, Monday 
through Wednesday, for the pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly. Thursdays through 
Saturdays, she devotes all her time to making appearances around the state as 
Indiana's First Lady, taking care of household matters at the governor's 
mansion and serving on committees. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no conflict of interest," she said. For Lilly, "I handle all federal 
issues -- checking advertising for product claims, making sure in house people 
comply with federal regulations, that sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Since January, Bayh has accepted honorary-chair positions for more than 100 
charitable and educational organizations. She speaks at luncheons and dinners 
on her work days. She enjoys speaking to high schools and colleges and this 
month has delivered a number of commencement addresses. 
</P>
<P>
"My two big projects are raising the level of literacy in Indiana and lowering 
the high school dropout rate," she explained. Addressing a high school assembly 
recently she told students "When your mom says do your homework, it's not 
nagging. It's an act of love. Studying is well worth all the hard work you put 
into it. Dropouts earn 42% less than high school graduates." 
</P>
<P>
She encouraged students to spend time with friends who have dropped out of 
school and urge them to come back. The First Lady of Indiana is working on a 
public awareness program which will include public service announcements to 
persuade illiterate adults to learn to read and dropouts to return to school. 
</P>
<P>
Addressing 400 women attending a recent YWCA "Women in the Workplace Program," 
she observed: "It's a shame that the state that gave us the great poet James 
Whitcomb Riley, the great songwriter Hoagie Carmichael and the great mystery 
writer Kurt Vonnegut has 400,000 illiterate citizens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Task of Redecorating 
</P>
<P>
Susan Bayh is having the governor's mansion repainted and redecorated, and she 
has commissioned 48 members of Purdue University's architectural class to 
re-design the landscaping of the 6 1/2 acres surrounding their official 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
As for their personal life, Susan Bayh says, "We try to have dinner together at 
least three nights a week and set aside Sunday as strictly a day of our own. 
The one bad part is I don't see my husband as much as I would like. We're both 
so busy." 
</P>
<P>
She drops in "to see what he's doing" in the Statehouse from time to time and 
on their fourth anniversary left a pile of Hershey kisses on his desk. 
</P>
<P>
The Bayhs both enjoy jogging, tennis and golf whenever they can find the time, 
which isn't very often. They have a staff of 16 at the mansion, including nine 
officers who provide security for both of them at all times. And there are at 
least eight formal functions there each month. 
</P>
<P>
"Evan asks me for my opinion about pressing issues," she said with a smile and 
twinkle in her blue eyes, adding: "A lot of times I give him unsolicited 
opinions." 
</P>
<P>
Evan Bayh's father was close to the Kennedy family, and several photographs of 
the late President John F. Kennedy and the late Sen. Robert Kennedy hang on the 
walls of the governor's office in the Capitol. Some newspapers have called the 
young governor, who is 6-foot-3, easy-going, warm and affable, "a Midwestern 
Jack Kennedy." 
</P>
<P>
A few days after Bayh's election, the Chicago Tribune carried an editorial that 
said in part: "As the Democratic Party struggles to define itself, searching 
for a candidate and a message to some day regain the White House, some believe 
the answer might lie in Indiana." 
</P>
<P>
"He's the first Democratic governor in Indiana in two decades," noted Fred 
Nation, 45, Bayh's press secretary. "And, he's the first Indiana governor in 40 
years whose party did not control either the House or Senate. All things 
considered he has done very well so far. Both the governor and his wife are 
extremely popular." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very exciting time for Evan and me," said Susan Bayh. "I'm really 
enjoying every moment. There are certain things I miss about California. I miss 
going to the beach. I miss Southern California weather when it's freezing in 
Indiana in winter . . . "

A GRADE-F NIGHTMARE: AFTER-SCHOOL CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE M. MILLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the clamor had died away and thousands of students had raced off to start 
the summer vacations they had dreamed about, one big detail remained before the 
school year ended in the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Call it a custodian's nightmare: the cleanup that started just after the 
schools closed at 12:20 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"There is trash everywhere!" said Gloria Teavey, a Palisades High School 
custodian. "We are talking all over the (school grounds), in the plant boxes, 
on the sidewalks. There's old homework, notebooks . . . anything in (students') 
lockers that they don't want, they feel free to throw out -- all over." 
</P>
<P>
Van Frazer, Bancroft Junior High plant manager, said: "You can find anything 
from shoes to T-shirts to 2-liter Coke bottles. But if they leave it in their 
lockers, it's history. It's getting thrown out." 
</P>
<P>
The refuse, Teavey said with a laugh, included items that "you might like to 
take home -- maybe a good notebook, a nice pair of shoes, a good jacket. 
Sometimes I wonder why they leave so much behind." 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Vernon, a Bancroft eighth-grader, had one explanation, saying 
students don't care about their possessions because they're "just too lazy!" 
</P>
<P>
Rasool Raheem, a Bancroft seventh-grader, agreed, adding: "Some kids say, 
'We're going to come back and clean up the mess.' I guess they never do." 
</P>
<P>
Bancroft principal Peggy Selma observed that when the school year ends, "the 
children go to their lockers and the things that at the beginning of the year 
were once so priceless" just don't seem to have the same value. And where the 
items end up at year's end reflects just that. 
</P>
<P>
At Palisades High alone, the once priceless booty by midday had filled seven 
large trash bins -- three or four more containers than usual -- and custodians 
said they still had lots more garbage to collect, Teavey said. At Marshall 
High, students -- working in a brigade known as the "Minute Men and Minute 
Maids" -- lent a helping hand to the custodial staff as part of an 8-year-old 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"They make a great contribution," said Perry Spencer, Marshall's plant manager. 
"They sure make our job a lot easier." 
</P>
<P>
Although most public schools try to make lives easier by conducting a locker 
clean-out and inspection in which administrators try to round up lost textbooks 
and other materials lent to students for the year, "the kind of books that were 
found" Friday at Bancroft didn't exactly match the middle school curriculum, 
Selma said. 
</P>
<P>
The captured collections "had some very risque material in them," she said, 
adding, "I mean, Playboy had nothing on what these magazines had to offer." 
</P>
<P>
This year's end-of-year "rubbage dump" did offer one positive attribute, school 
janitors said. 
</P>
<P>
"The mess was lighter this year than any other," said Teavey who has raked up 
after Palisades students for five years. "Maybe (students) are beginning to 
realize what slobs they are" and are trying a little harder, he said. "Most are 
well-mannered enough so that if they happen to drop something while I'm around, 
they will pick it up."

'ROMEO AND JULIET' A PLAY WITH 2 TELLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SULLIVAN, Times Theater Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Comparisons in theater aren't odious: They're enlightening. Consider the two 
productions of "Romeo and Juliet" that opened over the weekend, one in San 
Diego and one in Garden Grove. Each is an outdoor staging and each takes a 
traditional approach to the material. But, oh, what a difference. 
</P>
<P>
At the Old Globe Theatre (director: Richard E. T. White), we get a respectful 
mounting of a "great play." At the Grove Shakespeare Festival (director: Jules 
Aaron), we get an urgent telling of a wonderful story. 
</P>
<P>
The first difference is the design. At the Old Globe, the idea is to give us a 
picture of a real Italian square at high noon -- which, with a pull of a 
curtain, can become a real balcony at midnight. It is, as they say, as good as 
a movie. (Steven Rubin designed both the settings and costumes, and Robert 
Peterson did the painterly lighting.) 
</P>
<P>
Compare the paltry look of the Garden Grove production: the unfurnished set (by 
D. Martyn Bookwalter), the flimsy costumes (by Dwight Richard Odle), the 
generalized lighting (by David Palmer). Aside from the odd central element used 
for Juliet's balcony -- it looks like a corkscrew crossed with a crow's nest -- 
there's nothing to look at but the actors. 
</P>
<P>
Which means that the actors can't consider themselves figures in a landscape. 
They have to come out and sell the play. And they do. This isn't the subtlest 
production of "Romeo and Juliet" that you'll ever see, but it's in touch with 
the play's energy sources in a way that the San Diego production isn't. All the 
play's channels are open, not just the woeful ones. 
</P>
<P>
That's ironic, because it's the San Diego production that works harder at the 
details: at suggesting that Juliet's parents (Mike Genovese and Ellen Crawford) 
haven't slept together for years, for example, or that Romeo's cousin Benvolio 
(Albert Farrar) isn't much of a swordsman. 
</P>
<P>
Time gets lost in these little touches, however. The Garden Grove production 
makes its own points but makes them on the wing. When Friar Laurence (Harry 
Woolf) says farewell to Romeo (David Anthony Smith), a slight pause before his 
last "goodby" is enough to convey how much he's going to miss him. The idea is 
to convey the suddenness of love and death, not to linger on subsidiary 
insights. 
</P>
<P>
The play therefore seems much shorter and more clearly focused than in San 
Diego, although its running time is only 15 minutes less. Tempo isn't the only 
reason. Aaron's cast bites into the text with appreciation, as if they would 
rather be speaking Shakespeare than anything else. White's San Diego actors 
speak correctly, but they don't celebrate the language. Only Ken Ruta (Friar 
Laurence) and Mitchell Edmonds (Montague) account for every single word. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the play are Romeo and Juliet. In San Diego, Jon Tenney makes 
a good beginning, but doesn't sufficiently distinguish between the character's 
early lovesickness for Rosaline (Martha Perantoni) and his later bonding with 
Juliet. He needs to go deeper, while Monique Fowler needs to explore Juliet's 
vivacity, temper and intelligence. The major theme of her performance at the 
moment is that Juliet is suffering from emotions too large to be expressed. 
This is the way poignancy is conveyed on the soaps. It won't do for three 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Compare Susan Doupe's Juliet at Garden Grove, a delicate girl who believes in 
seizing the moment. She is eager to love, both because Romeo (David Anthony 
Smith) has captured her heart and because it's something of a prank of her 
parents (Larry Franklin and Pam Fisher). And in the tomb scene she is ready to 
die. Without lacking lyricism, this Juliet avoids the customary mooning around. 
She knows exactly what she's feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Smith's Romeo may be a bit of a twit, but he does suggest a young aristocrat, 
well trained at the fencing academy, and a man of feeling. He's sincerely 
concerned when Mercutio (John Walcutt) gets so carried away with his language 
that he almost falls into a fit. (Michael Cerveris' Mercutio at the Old Globe 
keeps both feet on the ground at all times.) This Romeo cares, and we can care 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
In short, the play works at one venue, and works much less well at the other. 
Leaving the Old Globe, you wonder if you haven't seen it too often. Leaving the 
Grove, it's a new play again, filled with possibilities. Shakespeare is a 
genius or a drone, depending on his helpers.

Legendary record producer and composer Phil Spector is embroiled in a 
$30-million libel suit against author Mark Ribowsky in New York's state Supreme 
Court. Ribowsky wrote an unauthorized biography of Spector entitled "He's a 
Rebel: The Truth About Phil Spector -- Rock and Roll's Legendary Madman" in 
which the author alleges that Spector abused his wife and 10-year-old son, is a 
racist and would demand credit and royalties as a co-writer of songs that he 
did not write as a condition for producing records. Spector, in his libel suit, 
has branded the allegations "false, scandalous and defamatory." A month before 
the biography was published in March, Spector's attorneys wrote Ribowsky and 
asked that he delay the publication of the book and supply a copy to Spector so 
that he could review the book. Spector's suit said that Ribowsky did not 
respond to the request.Claudia Puig

AN EXCEPTIONAL MANHATTAN TRANSFER IN WILTERN BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rule of thumb for benefit concerts is for musical groups to keep it simple, 
stick with their hits and smile a lot. The result is usually an evening of 
music safely within the taste restrictions of moneyed audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night's Wiltern Theatre performance featuring the Manhattan Transfer 
fund-raising effort for the Mountains Trust Benefit (to preserve the Santa 
Monica Mountains) was, for the most part, a welcome exception. 
</P>
<P>
The group's members -- Janis Siegel, Alan Paul, Tim Cheryl Bentyne -- performed 
individually and collectively throughout a program that managed to mix 
predictably frothy jazz and easy pop with some highly adventurous playing by 
the lesser-known artists on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
With nearly 17 years of togetherness under their belts, the Transfer has become 
a masterful musical ensemble. The harmonies they generated on their feature 
ballad, Thad Jones' lovely "To You," resulted in a blended sound with the 
singularly personal identity of the Ellington saxophone section. They were 
almost as impressive with numbers that ranged from Brazilian sambas and funky 
rock to briskly articulated jazz. 
</P>
<P>
The solo spots, however, were less impressive. Hauser kept a good face on his 
struggle with Bobby Timmons' "Dat Dere," but the phrasing on the song's bridge 
eluded him. Bentyne's overly histrionic reading of "Something Cool" missed the 
point of the song, then compounded the problem by omitting the climactic final 
bridge. Paul, however, provided a lovely dedication to the Mountain Fund with 
an original piece dedicated to the wildlife of the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Siegel, perhaps the best pure jazz singer in the group, was more effective with 
a thoughtful interpretation of "Key Largo" (performed with alto saxophonist 
Richie Cole) and a humorous duo with singer-songwriter-producer Robert Kraft. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief solo stint, altoist Cole seemed reluctant to display the be-bop 
licks that are the meat and potatoes of his style, opting instead for the 
stance and the manner of a crowd-pleasing hipster. 
</P>
<P>
Singer-guitarist Kenny Rankin's set was more typical. One of the finest 
interpretive performers in pop music, he applied his soaringly pristine tenor 
to the songs -- notably "Blackbird," "With A Little Help From My Friends" and 
"You Are So Beautiful" -- that have dominated his repertoire for the last few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The evening's boldest moments, however, were supplied by Kraft, guitarist Wayne 
Johnson and the duo of Jorge Strunz and Ardeshir Farah. 
</P>
<P>
Better known, perhaps, as the producer of recordings by Bette Midler and Bruce 
Willis, among others, Kraft has recently emerged as a wonderfully witty 
songwriter-singer. Mixing traces of Tom Waits and Randy Newman with his own 
whimsical variations on urban hip, he sang an affectionate reminiscence of "The 
Beat Generation," then countered with an acerbic portrait of Hollywood 
deal-making titled "Failing Upward" that was almost too true to be funny. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, the Manhattan Transfer's guitarist for the past decade, moved into the 
spotlight with his current Trio in a set filled with startling rhythmic twists 
and turns. A superior melodist, who is vividly aware of the value of soft and 
loud dynamic contrasts, Johnson made a powerful case for himself as a jazz 
fusion star of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Strunz and Farah's energetic blending of Latin, North African and jazz 
rhythms gave the program's second half a propulsive burst of energy. 
</P>
<P>
Satirist Harry Shearer's bits and pieces of humorously topical storytelling 
filled the brief gaps between musical acts.DON HECKMAN

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: INEPT CROOKS SPARK 'TROUBLEMAKER' COMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sixth American Film Institute European Community Film Festival continues 
tonight at 7 at the Fine Arts in Beverly Hills with Luxembourg writer-director 
Andy Bausch's amiably rambling, wry comedy "Troublemaker," which features two 
of the most inept crooks you'll ever see. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Chicago (Thierry Vanwerveke) and Chuck Moreno (Ender Frings) are a pair 
of youngish, sloppy, totally irresponsible guys who are constantly in and out 
of jail but are oddly likable. They and the film are slyly ingratiating, and 
Bausch comes up with a finish that's as totally unexpected as it is exactly 
right. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Fonseca e Costa's "Your Neighbor's Wife," which follows "Troublemaker" at 
9 p.m., reveals that there is a film maker in Portugal keeping alive the spirit 
of Douglas Sirk, now that R. W. Fassbinder is gone. 
</P>
<P>
Like Fassbinder, Fonseca e Costa elicits genuine emotion from the most 
schematic irony imaginable. The film is also a tribute to its durably elegant 
stars, Carmen Dolores and Vergilio Texeira, cast as former lovers to whom fate 
has seemingly given a second chance. (For flashbacks, Fonseca e Costa uses 
clips from a Dolores-Texeira film of some 40 years ago.) Fernanda Torres adds a 
lively note as Dolores' thoroughly uninhibited daughter. 
</P>
<P>
One of the delights of the festival, Jean-Charles Tacchella's "Travelling 
Avant" (Tuesday at 7 p.m.), recalls the postwar generation of Parisian film 
buffs from which the New Wave was eventually to emerge in the '50s. His young 
people, all of them desperately poor, flock to the Cinematheque Francaise, eat 
and sleep movies, especially American pictures, and dream of launching their 
own modest film society in an old suburban movie house. 
</P>
<P>
Belgium's Andre Delvaux brings rich imagery and a sense of immediacy to "The 
Abyss" (Tuesday at 9:10 p.m.), his film of Marguerite Yourcenar's novel about a 
free-thinking, truth-seeking, 16th-Century physician-alchemist. He returns 
home, under an alias, to Bruges after a 30-year absence, arriving as the 
conquering Spanish are conducting an inquisition. That the hero is played by 
Italy's masterful Gian Maria Volonte, a definitive screen rebel/political 
activist, unfortunately helps make the physician's fate seem predictable rather 
than inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Major disappointment: Margarethe von Trotta's leaden adaptation of Chekhov's 
"Three Sisters" (Thursday at 7 p.m.). Not even the vibrant Fanny Ardant, Greta 
Scacchi and Valeria Golino can make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
EuroFest, however, ends on a happy note with composer Michel Legrand's 
enchanting debut film "Five Days in June" (Thursday at 9 p.m.), involving his 
own coming of age, which took place under the most exciting circumstances. His 
14-year-old Michel (Mathieu Roze), a gifted pianist, picks up a Paris 
Conservatoire prize the very day the Allies land in Normandy. Michel and his 
mother (Annie Girardot) join forces with a beautiful free spirit, a young woman 
with just a touch of mystery (Sabine Azema, a dazzler memorable from "A Sunday 
in the Country") as they are forced to bicycle the long distance home, facing 
along the way the perils of the retreating German Army of Occupation.

The New Beverly Cinema will present the 15-chapter 1943 "Batman" in three parts 
on the next three Saturdays at midnight, and will repeat the serial if it 
proves popular. It may well do so, for this "Batman" proved to be great fun 
when it was presented in a five-hour marathon at the old Cinema Theater. It has 
an innocence not possible in the 1966 film or in the current blockbuster, and 
it has a wonderful pictorial quality, thanks to its director, silent-era 
pioneer Lambert Hillyer. Leslie Wilson stars, Douglas Croft is Robin, and J. 
Carrol Naish is the glorious villain, determined to steal our radium supply for 
the Nazis. Information: (213) 938-4038.

SOLO T BONE BURNETT SINGS, SPARS AT MCCABE'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON WALLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Performing in the put-up-or-shut-up framework of a solo acoustic showcase on 
Friday at McCabe's, singer/guitarist T Bone Burnett proved himself as humorous 
as devil worship and as serious as nuclear waste. The long tall Texan opened 
the first of two shows with his best, i.e., least affected song, "River of 
Love," and closed the 90-minute set by walking out onto Pico Boulevard to 
serenade the waiting late-show crowd with a campfire sing-along of "Kumbaya." 
</P>
<P>
In between, Burnett played pop, country, blues, and rock, ranging from the 
marks-his-Lennonisms of "Killer Moon" to two deja-vu versions of the standard 
"Where or When." A superb raconteur, Burnett sparred good-naturedly with the 
too-adoring crowd ("Don't underestimate us!" "Don't underestimate me" was one 
memorable exchange.) In a more subtle illumination of talent, Burnett 
(currently most successful as a producer of Los Lobos, Elvis Costello, et al.) 
displayed a casual mastery of the art of accompanying oneself on guitar. Always 
a pleasure to see a small room suck 'n' spit the excess artifice out of an 
artiste. DON WALLER

SCRAMBLING OVER SATELLITE DISHES RENEWED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So you're a sports fan, but you can't get cable TV. What to do? 
</P>
<P>
There is an alternative: Invest in a satellite dish. 
</P>
<P>
But, you ask, what about scrambling? 
</P>
<P>
Scrambling -- the process by which TV suppliers electronically jumble their 
satellite transmissions so they can only be seen with a special decoding device 
-- put a big damper on the sales of satellite dishes a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But the technology for decoding scrambled signals is now available to 
consumers, and the satellite dish industry is making a comeback. The difference 
is that most of the sports programming that formerly was available for free now 
must be paid for. 
</P>
<P>
About 2.3 million of the nation's homes are equipped with satellite dishes. 
About 500,000 of those homes have systems with de-scramblers, and that number 
is growing by about 15,000 per month. 
</P>
<P>
In Mira Mesa Business Park, an industrial area north of here, two modern 
buildings house the headquarters of the VideoCipher division of General 
Instrument Corp. Off to the side of the main lobby is an area filled with 
space-age television monitors and computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Esther Rodriguez, VideoCipher vice president, explains that this is called the 
DBS center -- for direct broadcast service, the trade term for the satellite 
dish business. Here, scrambled signals are unscrambled for home satellite dish 
consumers who own a VideoCipher II de-scrambler, or a similar one made by a 
competitor. 
</P>
<P>
VideoCipher, formerly M/A Com before being purchased by General Instrument in 
1986, owns the patent for scrambling and unscrambling signals and has licensed 
22 competitors. It operates the DBS center on a nonprofit basis in order to 
make money on hardware sales -- mainly de-scramblers and futuristic 
pay-per-view equipment. 
</P>
<P>
But many of the program suppliers require that consumers pay a fee to them for 
receiving their service, just as they would if they got it by cable. "That's 
been a tough adjustment for a lot of satellite dish owners," Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, after a 1979 Federal Communications Commission decision that 
removed the requirement that all Earth stations be licensed by the government, 
individual dish owners could tune in for free to virtually any TV signal that 
was being fed by satellite. This was particularly attractive to sports fans, 
who could get any event televised anywhere, including blacked-out pro football 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The only catch then was the price of a satellite dish system. In 1979, Neiman 
Marcus advertised a system for $36,000. But the price came down, first to 
$10,000, then $8,000 and eventually to about $2,500 for a top-of-the-line 
system. By 1985, more than 1 million homes had satellite dishes. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the standard dish systems continues to dwindle. A complete system, 
de-scrambler included, costs about $2,500 -- or about the same as systems 
without de-scramblers used to cost. 
</P>
<P>
As the business grew, however, programmers such as HBO became concerned that 
their product was being given away. So they began scrambling their signals and 
charging to have it decoded. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Dallas-based Satellite Sport Network distributes a package of six 
regional sports cable networks, including Prime Ticket, at a yearly fee of 
$95.40. The catch here is that pro sports leagues require blackouts. A Laker 
game on Prime Ticket, for instance, can be watched in Los Angeles but not in 
any other NBA city. Or a Houston Astros game on Home Sports Entertainment can 
be watched in Houston but not in any other baseball city. 
</P>
<P>
With the satellite dish business beginning to pick up again, there is 
speculation that it could eventually threaten the cable television industry. 
Imagine picking and choosing your own programming with no middle-man cable 
operator standing in the way. 
</P>
<P>
However, Rodriguez said: "We are not competing with cable. We look at our 
business as a supplement of cable, an alternative for those who can't get 
cable."

POST-PRINCE WENDY &amp; LISA COME OUT FIGHTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG LEE

<TEXT>
<P>
Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman were the major-domos of Prince's mighty 
Revolution, but recently there's been some purple rain on Wendy &amp; Lisa's 
parade. For one thing, they were recently dropped by their record label after 
two post-Prince albums. But the dynamic duo came out of their corner fighting 
at the Roxy on Friday, scoring points with a series of hard and heavy grooves. 
</P>
<P>
On a stage decorated in vintage hippie style, the women's seven-piece band 
unleashed a rich wash of sound, Coleman's ethereal keyboards and Melvoin's 
Hendrixian guitar centering material that ranged from the teasing funk of "Hey 
Yeah" to the propulsive heights of Prince's "Mountains." Melvoin's assured, 
nasal vocals were better than Coleman's whisper, but the real singing strength 
was in numbers as Wendy &amp; Lisa engaged in lush harmonies with their two 
sisters/backup singers. Unfortunately, the families' pajama-party camaraderie 
tended toward distracting dorkiness. 
</P>
<P>
And even if this was one of the best-sounding shows in recent memory, the 
constant vamp-riff-vamp pattern needed a stronger front-person to give it 
focus. Maybe someday that Prince will come. CRAIG LEE

KCET'S 'TAKE FIVE' SERIES PLAYS BEAT THE CLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY ATKINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If a comparison of their half-hour premieres is indicative, KCET's "Take Five: 
Science" (debuting at 7:30 tonight on Channel 28) makes better use of its time 
than its sibling "Take Five: Arts" (which debuted last Monday), even if 
"Science" does take more liberties with the limits on that time. 
</P>
<P>
The idea behind "Take Five" is to cover a single subject in five minutes, with 
segments airing four days a week from 7:30-7:35 p.m. But occasionally KCET will 
air compilations, where, it seems, the rules aren't quite so strict. There are 
only four segments in tonight's initial "Science" half-hour, and one of these 
-- on UC Santa Barbara anthropologist Napoleon Chagnon -- runs almost nine 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it's only coincidence that the Chagnon piece is also the best of the 
four -- a fascinating and even, somehow, reasonably comprehensive look at one 
man's attempt to document and preserve an Amazonian tribe threatened by 
everyone from shaman-degrading Christian missionaries to murderous gold miners. 
</P>
<P>
Or perhaps it isn't coincidence. Five -- or even six or seven -- minutes is an 
awfully small amount of time to cover something like headaches, the first topic 
"Science" addresses tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The strain shows: One moment we're being told about migraines, then the subject 
switches to "cluster" headaches, stays there a while, gives way to a short 
statement about "mind over matter" in combatting the pain, and then suddenly 
it's over. 
</P>
<P>
The other two segments fall somewhere between these extremes. A piece on the 
origins of the moon benefits from some neat computer animation illustrating the 
impact theory. The other segment, examining what makes certain athletes peak 
performers, has a slow-motion shot of Dodger star pitcher Orel Hershiser doing 
his stuff in shorts only, but it still doesn't leave much of an impression. 
</P>
<P>
Produced and introduced by Roger Bingham (from KCET's defunct "California 
Stories" series), "Take Five: Science" should prove interesting to keep track 
of -- not only for its potpourri of subjects but also for how well it battles 
that ticking clock.

DUBE'S AFRICAN REGGAE FOLLOWS ALL THE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lucky Dube is a South African singer who four years ago jumped from the comfort 
of Zulu pop to the more uncertain world of reggae. It was a brave cultural 
statement for an African to adopt the African-destiny cause of the Jamaican 
music, but the artistic results on display in Dube's L.A. debut Friday at the 
Palace were mixed. Except for one a cappella choral piece, the wiry performer 
made no attempt to blend the music of the homeland with that of the exiles 
seeking the homeland. Reggae's politics my be radical, but the musicians tend 
to follow the rules. 
</P>
<P>
But if it was standard-issue reggae, at least it was good reggae. Dube's six 
fatigues-clad instrumentalists and three colorfully-draped female singers 
delivered with a power and precision that were buoyed by a casual, offhand 
touch. His sharp-edged voice sometimes took on a Peter Gabriel-like huskiness, 
and he could whip out a spine-tingling, Princely falsetto to take things to 
higher ground. Dube (pronounced doo-BAY) addresses the usual big issues -- 
race, politics, theology, romance -- with a fair amount of eloquence, and he 
was in constant motion, with all limbs swinging like pistons. Entertaining 
enough at first, but after a while Dube came off like a wind-up reggae star.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: SANTA ANA; 
</P>
<P>
2 HELD AFTER OCCUPANTS OF AUTOS TRADE GUNFIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two people were arrested late Saturday after Santa Ana police officers happened 
upon two cars whose occupants were allegedly exchanging gunshots in an apparent 
gang-related battle. 
</P>
<P>
One of those arrested was wounded in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators with the gang division of the Santa Ana Police Department had 
stopped at the intersection of Downie Place and Fairview Street in an unmarked 
car when they saw a Chevrolet Impala race past, with shots being fired at an 
unidentified vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Police caught up to the Impala and arrested two of its occupants: Pedro 
Luevano, 21, of Los Angeles, and his brother, Javier, 20, who had been shot in 
the arm and chest. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they believe Javier Luevano was shot by people in the other 
vehicle, which eluded officers. 
</P>
<P>
Javier Luevano was taken to an undisclosed hospital and was listed in stable 
condition. His brother was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly 
weapon and of shooting at an occupied vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they expect to arrest Javier Luevano when his condition improves. 
</P>
<P>
A remaining passenger, a 17-year-old girl from Garden Grove, was released to 
her parents.

PEOPLE: TEACHER SPEAKS CHILDREN'S LANGUAGE: CARTOONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herbert J. Vida 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sound of waves crashing on the beach or birds chirping might be Curtis 
Visca doing his thing. "Sometimes when I'm drawing, I make weird sounds," said 
the first-grade teacher and cartoonist who thinks cartoons are something "silly 
and simple." 
</P>
<P>
It's no wonder a friend gave him the nickname "Wingnut." 
</P>
<P>
No matter. Visca often uses his cartooning skills to present an educational 
concept to his students at Truman-Benedict Elementary School in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
"I teach kids how to draw, and the cartoons they make help them tap hidden 
resources," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For Visca, 23, a Cal State Fullerton graduate who is studying for his 
doctorate, cartooning not only became an infatuation but a chance for the big 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I was going to conquer the world because I thought I would be the next Charles 
Schulz (creator of the Peanuts cartoon). But I started getting rejection 
slips," said Visca, who once worked at Disneyland as a sweeper and later in the 
art department. "That put me back in my place. And it hurt, because I thought I 
was something special." 
</P>
<P>
The central character in his cartoon is called "Wingnut." 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I do myself in the cartoons," he admitted. "It makes me feel good 
being able to draw something. It's kind of a release for me at the end of a 
hard day." 
</P>
<P>
But the harsh reality of rejection led him to the greeting card business. "I 
wanted the big bucks and thought I could get there by using my artwork to sell 
things. It started out as fun, but it got more into just business, and I didn't 
want that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So at age 24, Visca decided he needed a career change and went back to school 
for his teaching credential, a family tradition. His mother and father and most 
of his uncles are teachers. 
</P>
<P>
"I did some student teaching in elementary school, and I was concerned," he 
said. "I didn't think I could relate to them. But I found they didn't have any 
hang-ups or worries, and I liked that." 
</P>
<P>
Visca oftens rewards good work in his classroom with a cartoon. "I think it 
makes the students happy to get a cartoon, and it makes me happy because I 
enjoy drawing them. I like to make people happy." 
</P>
<P>
In his early drawing days, his mother was not among the happy crowd. "I drew on 
the walls at home -- and that really didn't make her happy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to keep busy and keep moving," he added, and that includes surfing. "My 
two escapes in life are surfing and cartooning." He also continues to work as a 
free-lancer on greeting cards and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, Visca is teaching cartooning to adults and children in the Dana 
Point Harbor Youth and Group facility, as well as for the San Clemente 
Recreation Department. 
</P>
<P>
His students will know if he's there. Visca's license plate has the name 
Wingnut on it. 
</P>
<P>
"Quilts are loving and keep people warm," said Placentia resident Del Thomas, 
who is one of about 500 members of the Orange County Quilter's Guild, which 
will leave its mark at the soon-to-be-opened Ronald McDonald House in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Each of the 36 beds at the facility, which will provide housing for out-of-area 
parents who bring their children to nearby hospitals, will have a quilt on it 
that was made by the group. In all, they will supply the house with 50 quilts. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said the guild can be seen working on a large, framed quilt on July 23 
at the Orange County Fair. Thomas added: "Anyone who wants to take a stitch or 
two can join in." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledgments -- Registered nurse Janni Smith of Lake Forest was presented 
the Heart of Gold Award for her work with Nobel prize nominee Dr. Jerrold 
Petrofsky of Lake Forest, who is studying methods to benefit paralyzed 
individuals through the use of computerized electrical stimulation. The award 
was given to Smith, a critical-care nurse paralyzed from the chest down, by the 
National League for Nursing for her "professional excellence and exemplary 
dedication to nursing."

JOYNER FINDS HAPPINESS IN POST-WALLY WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Wally World" is no more. Its originator and curator, Wally Joyner, said so 
Sunday afternoon after the Angels' 7-6 victory over the Orioles at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
When Joyner came to Anaheim in 1986 as a baby-faced, 24-year-old first baseman, 
he took the town by storm. He drove in 100 runs and hit 22 home runs as the 
Angels came within a strike of making the World Series. He hit 34 home runs and 
drove in 117 runs the next season. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was a star born, but an entire world. It was "Wally World" and Anaheim 
Stadium was his personal stage. 
</P>
<P>
But this business of hitting home runs has always been a little foreign to 
Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a home-run hitter," Joyner said Sunday. "I drive the ball into the 
alley and drive in runs." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, most people would have laughed at that explanation, but not now. 
The facts back Joyner's assessment. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, he hit only his second home run of the season and his first in 169 
at-bats. It was only his second homer since Sept. 1, 1988, a total of 352 
at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
So what's wrong? 
</P>
<P>
Nothing, according to Joyner. Although the home runs aren't coming the way they 
once were, Joyner said he's content to hit for average and drive in runs. 
</P>
<P>
That thinking has served him well lately. He's hitting .291, up from .236 a 
month ago, and has hit in 28 of his past 31 games. He's also batting .391 in 
the past 18 games. 
</P>
<P>
And the third-inning homer and a two-run double in the first inning Sunday 
pushed his RBI total to 27. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I created some expectations in other people's minds, but not mine," 
Joyner said of his first two seasons. "I'll probably never hit 34 home runs in 
a season again. But if I don't hit 34 home runs in a season, if I don't hit 20, 
does that mean I'm unsuccessful?" 
</P>
<P>
If Sunday's performance is any indication, Joyner has forgotten what it's like 
to hit a home run. 
</P>
<P>
At the crack of the bat in the third inning, Joyner began running and running 
hard. He said he didn't see the ball clear the fence in right-center field. 
</P>
<P>
"I was watching the center fielder (Mike Devereaux) and he kept running, so I 
kept running," said Joyner, who never broke into a home-run trot. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I haven't had too much practice." 
</P>
<P>
Joyner appears happy to have finally broken out of the slump that reduced him 
to hitting in the low .200s for the first two months of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like my best game this year might have been yesterday," he said. "I hit 
the ball hard four times." 
</P>
<P>
Joyner was three for four in Saturday night's 8-3 victory over the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
His two-for-four afternoon Sunday included a sharply hit double down the 
right-field line in the first, scoring Dick Schofield and Devon White to give 
the Angels a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Joyner's leadoff homer in the third started a four-run inning that chased 
Oriole starter Jeff Ballard. 
</P>
<P>
"I got underneath it," Joyner said. "I got some backspin on the ball, hit it in 
the air and the ball went out." 
</P>
<P>
Joyner figures if he keeps hitting the ball hard, the home runs will come, 
maybe not as many as before, but "Wally World" wasn't created in a day. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, those numbers will come back," Joyner said. 
</P>
<P>
But does Joyner ever miss those bygone days of numerous home runs and of "Wally 
World"? 
</P>
<P>
"No," he said. "I don't know if 'miss' is the right word. It was the right time 
and place for it to happen. But it's gone."

MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK / ELLIOTT TEAFORD;

<P>
PLEMEL GETS GUIDED TOUR THROUGH LIFE IN CLASS A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Elliott Teaford 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Lee Plemel was a high school and college pitcher, he collected school 
records and honors galore. He was a consistent, hard-throwing right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
At Laguna Hills High School, he was named to the All-Southern Section and 
All-Orange County teams in his junior and senior seasons. 
</P>
<P>
His school records for batting average (.472) and hits (45) in a season still 
stand. As a pitcher he was 12-1, setting a school record for victories in a 
season. He also had 110 strikeouts in his senior season, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Plemel went to Stanford and led the Cardinal to the College World Series title 
in 1987 and '88. He was 12-8 with a 115 strikeouts in his final college season 
and was named most outstanding player in the 1988 Series. 
</P>
<P>
Then Plemel got drafted and he had to confront the everyday grind of 
professional baseball. The St. Louis Cardinals picked him on the eighth round 
of the June 1988 draft. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the pro ranks, Mr. Plemel, now pack your bags. 
</P>
<P>
Plemel went through an uncomfortable first season, finding himself in more 
unfamiliar towns than he cared to count. 
</P>
<P>
He went from the College World Series to the Cardinals' Class-A team in 
Hamilton, Canada. After pitching one game, going five innings for a victory, he 
was sent packing to St. Petersburg, Fla., the Cardinals' top Class-A team. 
</P>
<P>
He struggled there with a 1-2 mark and a 6.97 earned-run average and was off 
again, this time to Savannah, Ga., another of the club's four Class-A teams. He 
was 1-1 with a 2.59 ERA at Savannah. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, he was 3-3 with a 3.32 ERA in his nine starts in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
When the 1989 season started, Plemel found himself at the only Cardinals' 
Class-A club he hadn't visited -- Springfield, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
He found it to his liking, posting a 5-2 record with a 1.88 ERA in 10 starts. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt pretty good there," Plemel said. "I felt like I was dominating. I felt 
like I could get to the seventh inning in every start and that's pretty much 
what I did." 
</P>
<P>
Plemel did so well the Cardinals decided to move him back to their top Class-A 
team at St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it a lot here," said Plemel, who has been in St. Petersburg since the 
beginning of June. "It's really warm, which I like. This (the Florida State 
League) is a great league. All the parks are great." 
</P>
<P>
For instance, St. Petersburg's home field is Al Lang Stadium, the St. Louis 
Cardinals' spring training headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
The more familiar surroundings seem to have helped Plemel, who is 1-2 with a 
4.50 ERA in four starts for the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
"I only had half a season last year," he said. "I'm starting to know what to 
expect. I'm pretty satisfied with the way things are going." 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes? Tom Baine, a former UC Irvine outfielder now playing at 
Louisville, the St. Louis Cardinals' triple-A affiliate, has drawn rave reviews 
for his hitting this season. 
</P>
<P>
Baine, who played at Irvine in 1985 and '86, is hitting .302 with 20 RBIs and 
one home run. Pretty heady stuff for a guy who's in only his first season of 
triple-A ball and who was taken in the 30th round by the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
George Rorrer of Baseball America Magazine wondered what major leaguer, past or 
present, Baine's hitting style most closely resembled. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Jorgensen, a former St. Louis Cardinal first baseman and current 
Louisville manager, said it's Wade Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
"That isn't to say that Baine hits like Boggs, but he's the same type of 
hitter," Jorgensen said. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Baine was the only player in the Cardinals' farm system to bat 
higher than .300, hitting .307 at double-A Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
At one point this season he was the leading hitter in the American Assn. with a 
.328 average. He's now third behind Junior Noboa and Razor Shines, both of 
Indianapolis, the Montreal Expos' affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
He had 12 multiple-hit games and 34 walks in his first 44 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to have discipline at the plate, try not to help the pitcher by swinging 
at bad pitches," Baine said. "If you do that, you get ahead in the count and 
get better pitches to hit." 
</P>
<P>
Brent Mayne, former Cal State Fullerton catcher, made the most of his 
professional debut. Playing in his first game for the Kansas City Royals' 
Class-A affiliate at Baseball City in Florida, Mayne singled in his first 
at-bat.

COSTA MESA TROUPE TAKES 3RD PRIZE IN NATIONAL DRAMA CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The Costa Mesa Civic Playhouse won third prize Saturday at a national 
competition for community theaters in Omaha, Neb., earning the right to 
represent the United States at an international drama festival in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
First prize went to the Spokane Civic Theatre from Spokane, Wash., and second 
prize to the Encore Theatre from Washington, D.C. The top award carries an 
invitation to a drama festival in Monaco; the second to one in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Nine theater troupes from around the country performed Thursday and Friday at 
the 600-seat Mainstage of the Omaha Community Playhouse. The biannual national 
competition is sponsored by the American Assn. of Community Theaters, which 
represents about 250 amateur troupes in 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa troupe qualified for the finals in Omaha when it won a regional 
competition in March with scenes from William Gibson's "Monday After the 
Miracle." It performed the same scenes in the finals, but in a restaged 
version. The cast included Deeanna Pampena, Susan Adams and Marc Whitmore. 
</P>
<P>
"Monday After the Miracle" was offered as part of the playhouse's 25th season 
in November. It is a sequel to Gibson's "The Miracle Worker," the better known 
of his two plays about Helen Keller, who was born blind and deaf, and her 
devoted teacher, Annie Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very proud of what they've done with this show," Pati Tambellini, a 
playhouse founder, said Saturday after hearing that some members of the troupe 
"were devastated" not to have won the top prize. "This is their first 
competition, and it is fabulous," she added. 
</P>
<P>
The first-place winner performed excerpts from Marsha Norman's "Getting Out." 
The second-place troupe staged sequences from Samm-Art Williams' "Home." 
</P>
<P>
A panel of three judges chose the winners. 
</P>
<P>
"Costa Mesa had the most reality-based performances, and they were among the 
best-received by the audience," said Curt Ratliff of the Omaha Playhouse. "The 
company that did 'Home' was very experimental, a powerful group. But I'd say 
Spokane's 'Getting Out' was the hands-down favorite." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the prize, the Costa Mesa troupe also won three technical awards 
-- for director Howard Shangraw's set and lighting designs and for Loretta 
Lupo's costumes. 
</P>
<P>
The group's invitation is to the International Amateur Theater Festival of the 
Mediterranean in Barcelona, Spain, which will be in September. If the 
invitation is accepted -- and Tambellini said she believes it will be -- 
financing must be found for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the Laguna Playhouse of Laguna Beach won the national competition with 
"Quilters." It went on to represent the United States at the 23rd annual 
International Community Theater Festival in Dundalk, Ireland, in June, 1988. It 
placed second in that competition. 
</P>
<P>
This year's national winner will go in late August to the International Amateur 
Theater Assn. Festival in Monaco, a non-competitive showcase held every four 
years. The runner-up will attend the biannual Toyama Festival, a competitive 
event held north of Tokyo in Toyama, Japan, also this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-place winner was the Music Society for the Midland Center for the 
Arts, a troupe from Midland, Mich., which did excerpts from Dan Goggin's 
"Nunsense." It gained a berth at the Canada National Showcase of Community 
Theaters to be held later this year in Victoria, British Columbia.

ART / CATHY CURTIS: INERT ART SETTLES FOR MERELY FILLING IN THE BACKGROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Cathy Curtis 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The teen-ager had painted a still life, and she was burning to know what her 
father thought of it. His words would mean more to her than just fatherly 
approval, because he was the painter Philip Guston, one of a handful of major 
artists in the United States: 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't you see?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "See what?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That background here. Just look how it's painted. Now, what was going on 
inside you when you painted that?" 
</P>
<P>
 I looked carefully. I couldn't remember what I'd been thinking. It looked 
perfectly OK to me. "What's wrong with it?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly he seemed irritated, almost angry. "There's no feeling in it, that's 
what's wrong. It's flat. Filling in. Like painting a house. . . . I don't mean 
to hurt you darling, but you have to understand -- that's simply not painting." 
</P>
<P>
 That conversation comes from a powerful new book, "Night Studio: A Memoir of 
Philip Guston" (Knopf), by his daughter, Musa Mayer. It provides a close and 
candid look at the artist's personality and struggles, and the way his family 
was affected by them. 
</P>
<P>
The passage came to mind the other day at the Irvine Fine Arts Center, where 
"All Media '89" -- featuring nearly 100 works by county artists -- is on view 
through July 18. Although this show is somewhat better than last year's -- when 
the Irvine Creative Arts Guild first turned to a juried format for its annual 
exhibit -- it remains a repository for a lot of depressingly inert art. 
</P>
<P>
Juror William Otton, president of the Art Institute of Southern California, is 
partly at fault in turning a blind eye to the deficiencies in most of the 98 
pieces he chose from the 284 entries. It did not help that he was obliged -- as 
is common in juried shows -- to pick enough pieces to fill up the gallery. 
</P>
<P>
But ultimately the fault lies with the artists themselves. Most give no 
impression of trying to make subtle and serious work. Instead, they seem to be 
aiming no higher than lower-level gallery fare and second-rate commercial art. 
</P>
<P>
While it would be ridiculous to expect dazzling execution or rigorous 
conceptual standards from the artists who enter such shows, it is not out of 
place to expect a glimmer of imagination and a degree of awareness of what 
serious contemporary art is, or can be. Looking at a sea of tepid landscapes 
and hackneyed figurative work and flatfooted abstraction, a viewer begins to 
wonder whether the artists realize how distant their work is from the real 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Juried shows do seem to attract a small percentage of genuinely naive artists 
who may see the world in wonderfully skewed ways, even if they are ignorant of 
the difference between gift-shop kitsch and serious art. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the artists whose work is on view seem to be doing little more than 
"filling in the background," like the teen-aged Musa Guston. Unlike her, they 
may not have heard the brutal truth from a respected teacher. Perhaps part of 
the blame lies with community art classes, in which so much attention is paid 
to technical matters that the passions and ideas that feed into art do not 
receive their due. Perhaps teachers are also afraid of losing enrollments if 
they get too critical. 
</P>
<P>
If only everyone who takes an art course could emerge with one big idea 
emblazoned forever in their minds: In fine art, as opposed to the lower slopes 
of commercial art, technical ability does not substitute for fresh ideas. Based 
on his drawing, "Looking Back at Youth," for example, a viewer is convinced 
that Ron Elstad could probably draw anything under the sun. But his image -- of 
a paunchy older man looking at a couple of pretty teen-aged girls at the beach 
-- is trite. It tells us nothing new about youth or age. 
</P>
<P>
A few artists do seem to be reaching for big things that elude their grasp. 
Martha Jackson's "Stasis," a painting on wood with whitened, canceled-out 
images, seems too carefully controlled, too clamped-down and consciously 
perfectionist to come across as a trustworthy personal vision. In Lynn 
Kubasek's "Five-Day Record" -- a series of tubular lengths of gold material 
knotted in various ways -- the glitz factor makes it unclear whether the piece 
is to be read as a kind of "process" art. 
</P>
<P>
Among the brighter spots in the show, Phora Gerdes' "Ol' Lady on Cane" ranks 
high. It did not even win an award, but it has a vitality lacking in many other 
pieces. Made of castaway objects, the sculpture is a fragmentary portrait of an 
elderly woman. Her single arm holds a metal cane planted in a circle of brown 
rug. Inside her cotton-stuffed brain, we see the image from her youth that 
sticks in her mind: two little girls on a tiny, revolving teeter-totter. 
</P>
<P>
The witty "Rose Parade" title supplies the oomph factor for Sally Goldberg's 
color photograph of rows of rose corsages in their little plastic vials, stuck 
in a piece of plastic foam. The piece won an Irvine Art Center Special 
Exhibition Award. 
</P>
<P>
April Hunt-Good's "Laguna Canyon No. 1," a painting of the patterns left by 
tractors in the earth -- which won the Orange County Centennial Theme Award -- 
is a cut above more routine landscapes, forsaking prettiness to express a point 
of view about land use. 
</P>
<P>
Darlene Campbell took first place with "Waiting for Another Season," a vividly 
painted lonely landscape in which fallen leaves almost seem to hover over a 
rich, dense carpet of grass. But this is work that hovers on the edge of 
formula, with its neatly wrapped-and-tied presentation of sweet details. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Gallup uses a sort of Chinese-box trick -- concentric, graduated images 
of folded card tables attached to a real table -- in "The Vertigo of the 
Simulacrum." A companion piece consists of similarly arranged photographs of 
the first piece, taking the whole idea of copy-making into a truly dizzying 
realm. 
</P>
<P>
It was good too to see work by relatively established artists Duncan Simcoe and 
Jim Cokas. (Cokas' blurry fixed-focus camera photographs netted an Irvine Fine 
Arts Special Exhibition Award; Simcoe took second place with a wry mixed-media 
piece, "A brief explanation of our home marketing techniques.") 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, with increasing numbers of entrants whose mettle has been tested in 
the "real world" of respected curated exhibitions, other competitors will be 
more likely to push themselves beyond banality -- or frankly face the 
possibility that their talents might lie in another direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Media '89" remains through July 18 at the Irvine Fine Arts Center, 14321 
Yale Ave. Gallery hours are 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 9 a.m. to

The State Department today urged the Cuban government to take "all necessary 
precautions" in its plan to stem drug trafficking by shooting down planes that 
refuse to land for inspection. 
</P>
<P>
"While we welcome any legitimate action to interdict narcotics trafficking, we 
urge the Cuban government to take all necessary precautions and to exercise 
restraint . . . to avoid the loss of innocent life," said State Department 
deputy spokesman Richard Boucher. 
</P>
<P>
Cuban authorities announced the plan Saturday after arresting a highly 
decorated general and nine other military officers on charges of accepting 
bribes from drug traffickers.

INS CHIEF RESIGNS; UNDER FIRE IN JUSTICE DEPT. AUDIT

<P>
Alan C. Nelson, criticized in a Justice Department audit earlier this year, 
resigned under fire today as head of the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service, Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh announced. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy INS Commissioner James L. Buck was named acting head of the service. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Department spokesman David Runkel declined to say why Nelson was being 
replaced before a permanent successor is found. 
</P>
<P>
Department officials have privately expressed dissatisfaction with Nelson, a 
holdover from the Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Gene McNary, the chief executive of St. Louis County, Mo., is expected to be 
nominated by President Bush to fill the post. 
</P>
<P>
A Justice Department audit ordered by Thornburgh earlier this year criticized 
the accounting, management and administrative practices at INS. It cited 
growing backlogs in cases awaiting decisions and the loss by a regional office 
of 23,000 citizenship certificates. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson defended the agency, criticizing the audit as "grossly deficient," and 
INS officials in Miami said all but 5% of the citizenship certificates in 
question had been found. 
</P>
<P>
The audit noted that the agency had spent $1,500 for an oil portrait of Nelson, 
and Justice Department officials were privately critical of a videotape tribute 
to Nelson that INS produced at taxpayer expense.

ALISO BEACH REMAINS CLOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times wire services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sections of Aliso Beach may remain closed through the July 4 holiday weekend 
because of a sewage pipeline break that dumped more than 900,000 gallons of raw 
effluent into the surf, a county health official said today. 
</P>
<P>
Water authorities said they will replace a 450-foot length of the aging 
concrete pipe that ruptured last week, spilling sewage into Aliso Creek before 
temporary repairs could be made. 
</P>
<P>
A mile-long stretch of Aliso Beach remained closed today for the fifth straight 
day. Signs were posted warning of contaminated water conditions, and lifeguards 
continued to turn people away from the beach, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Wehner, water quality program chief in the environmental health division 
of the Orange County Health Care Agency, said sunny weather and heavy surf 
could help speed up the dissipation of sewage along the popular beachfront, but 
he could not predict whether the entire stretch of sand would be open by next 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We expect portions to be opened, but we don't know if we'll see the entire 
area opened," Wehner said. "At this point, it's too tough to call. We can hope, 
but we won't know for sure for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Tests conducted Friday indicated extensive contamination along the beach from 
Treasure Island Point on the north to Table Rock on the south, he said. More 
tests were to be conducted today, with preliminary results expected by Tuesday 
afternoon, Wehner said.

The crew of an Amtrak passenger train reported that the train came under 
gunfire as it traveled through the Chatsworth section of the San Fernando 
Valley, but no injuries were reported, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
Seven people, including three juveniles, were arrested for investigation of 
trespassing after police found them near the train tracks about 9:30 p.m. 
Sunday, Sgt. Ted DeMaegt said. 
</P>

Actor Anthony Perkins was fined $310 today for smuggling a small amount of 
marijuana into Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Perkins, 57, mailed 1.32 grams of marijuana with a street value of about $7 
from his Los Angeles home to coincide with his arrival at a hotel in Wales 
where he was filming, the court was told. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel staff, however, delivered the package to someone else named Perkins who 
opened it to find a small, aluminum-foil packet containing enough drugs for 
three or four cannabis cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
The American actor was arrested by two detectives when he checked in Sunday.

EX-GEISHA 'CLEANSES HEART' WITH BLAST AT UNO

A former geisha who rocked Japan's political world by alleging that Prime 
Minister Sosuki Uno paid her for sex appeared for the first time on television 
Sunday and said Uno was cruel to her and doesn't deserve to be prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview from a Buddhist temple where she said she is seeking to 
"cleanse my heart," Mitsuko Nakanishi, 40, said Uno paid her $21,000 to be on 
24-hour call as his mistress. Nakanishi showed the interviewer an envelope with 
Uno's return address in which she said she received the first payment of 
$14,000 in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me to come whenever he calls," she told TBS television. "It was as if 
I had to wear a beeper at all times." 
</P>
<P>
Nakanishi shocked Japan's male-dominated political world June 5 when her story 
appeared in a weekly news magazine without her name. The magazine article broke 
a longstanding taboo in Japan against reports on politicians' private lives. 
</P>
<P>
Nakanishi said telling her story on television may mean that she will never 
work in Japan again, but she added that her dislike for Uno is so strong she 
had to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I expect revenge but I am ready for it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Uno was cruel to her and other women, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"He should have been kinder," Nakanishi said. "What good is a person who lacks 
sympathy for those less fortunate than him? He should not be in politics." 
</P>
<P>
Uno, 66, has refused to comment on Nakanishi's accusations. 
</P>
<P>
Geishas, literally "art people," entertain their customers with traditional 
songs, dance and musical instruments. They are not typically hired for sex, but 
it is not unusual for one to become the mistress of one faithful customer.

A fire that forced a Soviet nuclear submarine to limp toward port was caused by 
a pipe that burst, causing a reactor malfunction but no injuries, Soviet 
officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
The sub billowed smoke today as it steamed under the power of back-up diesel 
engines. 
</P>
<P>
Norwegian officials criticized Soviet officials for not informing them fully of 
the accident, the second involving a Soviet vessel off Norway in less than a 
week and the third in three months. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It Is Unsatisfactory' 
</P>
<P>
"It is unsatisfactory for us as a neighboring state not to be warned," Defense 
Minister Johan Jorgen Holst told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
No radiation leaks were reported aboard the vessel, which was of a class built 
in the 1960s to carry nuclear-tipped cruise missiles. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov said the accident happened 
on the sub's energy apparatus while the sub was submerged. A reactor pipeline 
burst and its seal was broken, the government newspaper Izvestia quoted him as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
Yazov said the sub switched to backup diesel engines, surfaced and took on 
water to cool the reactor. He said all crew members were safe and the accident 
did not damage the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Yazov said another Soviet vessel will escort the ship east to Severomorsk. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet media did not give the name of the Echo II class submarine or say 
whether it was carrying nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
A Norwegian Northern Defense Command spokesman said the submarine apparently 
caught fire at about 5 a.m. in the Norwegian Sea off northern Norway. 
</P>
<P>
On June 20, the Soviet cruise ship Maxim Gorky was torn open by ice and nearly 
sank near Norway's Spitzbergen Island. No casualties were reported. On April 7, 
a Soviet Mike-class submarine caught fire and sank in the Norwegian Sea, 
killing 42 Soviet sailors.

In what appeared to be a U.S. policy shift, Assistant Secretary of State 
Lawrence S. Eagleburger said in an interview broadcast today that Syria should 
withdraw from Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"The Syrians have to back off," Eagleburger said in an interview on 
Christian-controlled Voice of Lebanon conducted by the station's Washington 
correspondent. "All of the outside parties ought to back off and let the 
Lebanese make their own judgment about where their future lies. There is too 
much foreign involvement on all sides." 
</P>
<P>
His remarks in the taped interview reversed a statement he made before the 
Senate Foreign Affairs Committee on March 16. He said at that time that the 
withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon would aggravate the situation because 
their presence restrains the warring parties.

The Central Conference of American Rabbis called on Israel today to negotiate 
with "freely chosen representatives" of the Palestinian people in an effort to 
bring peace to the troubled area. 
</P>
<P>
In a sometimes sharply bitter debate, the conference -- the rabbinical arm of 
Reform Judaism in the United States -- also condemned "the violence and terror 
from whatever quarter" that has accompanied the 1 1/2-year-old Palestinian 
intifada, or uprising, in the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a deafening silence coming out of the CCAR when it comes to the 
Palestinian uprising," said Rabbi Israel Dresner, Wayne, N.J., urging the 
conference to speak tough to Israel. "Israel is now the party saying: 'no 
partition, no recognition, no peace.' " 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, however, urging the conference not to be arrogant in speaking to 
Israel, reminded the body that no American Jews are at risk as a result of the 
intifada.

"He asked me to look into a company that could sweep his house for bugs. He

"He asked me to take all the financial records and quietly destroy them,"

SALES OF EXISTING HOMES FALL 5.6%

Despite falling mortgage rates, sales of existing homes dropped 5.6% in May to 
their lowest level in 16 months, the National Assn. of Realtors reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The real estate trade group said existing single-family homes were sold at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.21 million units last month. The previous 
low was 3.2 million units in January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The drop in May followed sales of 3.4 million units in both March and April, 
down 2% from February. The May resale rate was off 11.3% from the rate a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The weakness in sales this year has been attributed to rising home mortgage 
rates, reflecting efforts by the Federal Reserve to fight inflationary 
pressures by tightening the supply of credit. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed has been easing its grip on credit recently. Fixed-rate mortgages have 
fallen from a high of 11.22% in March to 10.48% at the end of May, according to 
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.

BRITAIN REJECTS EUROPEAN BANK, SINGLE CURRENCY

<P>
Britain today rejected plans to create a single European currency and a central 
bank but pledged to accept some elements of a plan to form a united European 
market by late 1992. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany, however, urged the leaders of the 12-nation European Economic 
Community to endorse the single currency and central bank. 
</P>
<P>
Under a plan being considered at an EEC summit in Madrid, member states would 
gradually hand over economic policy-making power to the EEC. Surrendering 
aspects of national sovereignty is a key issue as the community heads toward 
dropping all trade barriers and creating the single market in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"Decisions on these matters are simply not on the current agenda," British 
officials quoted Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as telling the closed-door 
summit meeting. "We must stick to the practical and go for what needs to be 
done now." 
</P>
<P>
The leaders adjourned for lunch on the first day of the two-day summit with 
aides seeking to draw up a compromise position. 
</P>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl pressed the leaders to accept the plan in 
its entirety, his spokesman, Hans Klein, said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of endorsing the first stage of the plan, which would begin in July, 
1990, Thatcher pledged to link the pound to the other major EEC currencies by 
joining the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. 
</P>
<P>
But a British spokesman, who requested anonymity, said Thatcher said Britain 
will join the European Monetary system if Britain's 8.3% inflation rate is 
"reduced significantly," if other EEC countries abolish exchange controls by 
July, 1990, and if the community allows an open market in banking and financial 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher argued that earlier membership in the currency alignment by Britain 
could have shaken the entire system. Britain is the only major oil producer in 
the EEC, and the pound is boosted by oil price increases, which tend to depress 
the other currencies.

Kuwait, which has weakened past efforts of the OPEC oil cartel to support 
higher world prices by cheating on its quota, was reported today as saying it 
will cut back on production. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheik Ali al Khalifa al Sabah was reported by the 
Petroleum Intelligence Weekly saying his country plans to reduce production to 
1.35 million barrels a day, far below its current estimated production. 
</P>
<P>
The respected trade newsletter recently quoted industry sources as estimating 
Kuwait would pump 2.3 million barrels a day in June. A source in a large U.S. 
oil company last week said his company estimated current Kuwaiti production at 
1.8 million barrels daily. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait was assigned a daily quota of 1.093 million barrels at the mid-year 
meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries early this month 
in Vienna, which Ali quickly disavowed.

The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling that CBS Inc. no longer enjoys 
trademark protection for the "Amos 'n' Andy" radio and television shows. 
</P>
<P>
The justices, without comment, refused to review a federal appeals court ruling 
that CBS abandoned the trademarks when, under pressure from civil rights 
groups, it suspended commercial use of the shows. 
</P>
<P>
The asserted trademarks were challenged by Stephen M. Silverman, who wants to 
produce a musical play based on the "Amos 'n' Andy" shows and their characters. 
</P>
<P>
The case now returns to a federal judge in New York City, who is to rule on 
other aspects of the dispute. Today's high court action does not remove all 
legal hurdles confronting Silverman.

Julie Rocheleau-Baumann, Canada's top female hurdler, purchased banned steroids 
and human growth hormone from a Quebec bodybuilder and admitted drug supplier, 
a federal drug inquiry into amateur athletics was told today. 
</P>
<P>
Benoit Levesque, 29, testified under oath that Rocheleau-Baumann approached him 
last June seeking the drugs, which are used to help athletes build muscle. 
</P>
<P>
"She thought it was the best way for her of competing without any substances 
being detected on her," said Levesque, who has won numerous Canadian 
bodybuilding titles. 
</P>
<P>
Rocheleau-Baumann, 25, now living in Switzerland, has refused to appear before 
the Canadian inquiry sparked by the Ben Johnson scandal and denies using drugs. 
She finished sixth in the 100 meters at Seoul but recently failed a random drug 
test instituted by the Canadian Track and Field Assn.

MAJOR LEAGUE FIRST: OPPOSING BLACK MANAGERS

Baseball fans in Baltimore will see history Tuesday night, although many may 
not notice. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the major leagues, two black managers will oppose each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
Cito Gaston of the Toronto Blue Jays and Frank Robinson of the Orioles will be 
in the dugouts, but neither is making a big deal of the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't even think about it until now," Gaston said. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't be me managing against Cito, it's Baltimore vs. Toronto," Robinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The black-and-white issue is more than a footnote to appear in the 
black-and-white print of the record books. For several years, minority hiring 
has been a goal of the game, and Tuesday night's meeting marks another small 
step on the path of progress. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, however, did not attach much significance to the upcoming game. 
</P>
<P>
"You are foreseeing an angle I just don't care to discuss," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Surprising, because in his recent book, Robinson chided the media for not 
giving more attention to a spring-training game in 1981 with two black managers 
-- when he was with San Francisco and Maury Wills with Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Reminded of that, Robinson reconsidered. 
</P>
<P>
"Things change, times change," he said. "Now, it's a totally different 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
Back then, Robinson, Wills and Larry Doby had been the only black managers in a 
sport in which there were virtually no blacks in front-office or leadership 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
There had not been any more black managers in the majors since then until 
Toronto fired Jimy Williams last month and promoted Gaston, but more minorities 
are getting opportunities in other positions. 
</P>
<P>
"With Cito being hired, it will help the situation as far as black managers," 
Robinson said a few weeks ago. "There will be more blacks hired and more blacks 
fired, and maybe it won't be such a big thing any more." 
</P>
<P>
Black managers have met in the minor leagues. The first time was in 1987 when 
Derrel Thomas of Boise went against Mel Roberts of Bend, Ore., in a Class A 
Northwest League game. 
</P>
<P>
The number of minority managers and coaches in the minors has increased, and 
the meeting of Robinson and Gaston on the major-league level is another visible 
sign of improvement. 
</P>
<P>
Gaston, meanwhile, is thinking in terms of Blue Jays, not in terms of black 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't be out there playing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
This will be the first game of the season between the teams. Gaston sees the 
managers discussing the race -- the pennant race.

EAST GERMAN ATHLETES' USE OF DRUGS TOLD

A former Olympic champion and a former top sports official from East Germany 
today accused all of the country's international athletes of taking drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Every athlete that competes internationally for East Germany is doped, every 
one," Hans-Juergen Noczenski, former head of the East German Judo Assn., was 
quoted as saying in the popular West German newspaper Bild. 
</P>
<P>
Noczenski, who defected to the West last February, made the accusation after 
one of the most detailed pictures of alleged drug abuse in East Germany by 1976 
Olympic ski jumping gold medalist Hans-Georg Aschenbach was given in another 
West German paper. 
</P>
<P>
Aschenbach said that he was forced to take muscle-building anabolic drugs for 
the whole of his career and that all of the country's stars were obliged to 
take them. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to take the drugs. We were forced to," he told Bild am Sonntag. "Those 
who didn't were dropped from the national teams, from their clubs, and life was 
made difficult for them." 
</P>
<P>
Aschenbach, who defected to the West during a visit with the East German ski 
jumping team 10 months ago, was not available to confirm the reports today at 
the sports clinic in Freiburg where he is a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
But his reported statements in a page-long article in Bild am Sonntag are the 
most controversial on drug abuse in the Eastern Bloc. East German newspapers 
made no mention of the accusations today. 
</P>
<P>
Aschenbach, 38, said he took drugs in the form of pills and injections for 
eight years. He was told by East German team officials that the pills were 
vitamins, but older team mates told him they were drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"We were forbidden to talk to anybody about them; anybody who talked was 
dropped from the team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to take 30 to 40 milligrams of nandrolon (made up of various male sex 
hormones) each day. That was six to eight pills. Ten days before an event we 
stopped taking the drugs. It took five days to clear them from the body. We 
used to call it double security." 
</P>
<P>
Noczenski told Bild that East German athletes rarely tested positive for dope 
because the authorities tested the urine of all athletes before they were 
allowed to compete abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"A car drove all round East Germany collecting the urine samples. They were 
tested in a doping center, and only those who were clean were allowed to 
compete," he said. "Those who weren't were told to say they were injured." 
</P>
<P>
Aschenbach said the drug abuse made his Olympic triumph in Innsbruck the worst 
few hours of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I had won gold and then came the dope test. My God, what I had to go through. 
I kept thinking: 'Will they catch me? Have I done all this for nothing? Am I 
going to be the idiot that everyone will laugh at?' With all that in your mind 
you even forget that you have actually won."

BASEBALL APPEALS COURT DECISION IN ROSE CASE

Baseball's lawyers today asked an Ohio appellate court to suspend a judge's 
ruling that postponed Pete Rose's hearing before Commissioner Bart Giamatti, 
saying the lower court's restraining order "threatens the very reputation of 
major league baseball." 
</P>
<P>
In a 220-page request for the suspension of the temporary restraining order 
granted Sunday by Commons Pleas Judge Norbert A. Nadel, baseball called the 
ruling unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
"For the last several weeks, the charges against Pete Rose have focused 
enormous public attention on gambling and the possible corruption of the game," 
baseball said in asking that the temporary restraining order be suspended. "Now 
that Pete Rose has aired these charges by bringing suit, it has become critical 
for the commissioner's office to act promptly to maintain public confidence in 
the integrity of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"If every action of the commissioner to investigate and determine matters 
affecting the integrity of the game were to be subject to court intervention 
and delay, the commissioner's ability to safeguard the integrity of the game 
would be destroyed. The action of the court . . . threatens the very reputation 
of major league baseball and deprives the commissioner of the power to protect 
the integrity of the game." 
</P>
<P>
A three-judge panel of the Ohio 1st District Court of Appeals will decide 
baseball's request after receiving a response from Rose's lawyers, which is due 
by 9 a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nadel scheduled a meeting this afternoon in his chambers with 
lawyers from both sides. And Nadel also had until 5 p.m. today local time to 
respond to an order from the Ohio Supreme Court that he show cause why the 
report on Rose from baseball investigator John M. Dowd should not be made 
public.
