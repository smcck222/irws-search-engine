NEW YORK CARDINAL O'CONNOR'S WARNING TO CATHOLIC POLITICIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas was correct when he said that Catholic legislators who cannot carry out 
their job in an ethical way should resign. No responsible Catholic can support 
the unjust killing of the unborn, and any Catholic who exalts this grisly 
attitude should be excommunicated, if for nothing else, reality therapy. 
</P>
<P>
According to science, a unique human being is created with all the biological 
necessities for life at conception, and one hour later he starts a process of 
development which will last a lifetime. For the individual who is subject to 
murder, there is no difference between killing him in the first trimester, the 
second trimester, infanticide, genocide, or at the age of 35. It's all the same 
human being in different stages of development.

NEW YORK CARDINAL O'CONNOR'S WARNING TO CATHOLIC POLITICIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal Thomas posits that ultimate allegiance to God supersedes allegiance to the 
state ("O'Connor's Moral Clarity," Commentary, June 20). He is, of course, 
speaking favorably about New York's Cardinal John O'Connor chastising Catholic 
politicians who stray from the church's abortion stance. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, this position also validates the breaking of laws by civil rights 
activists and Vietnam War resisters during the 1960s. Then many ministers 
believed that it did. 
</P>
<P>
In this land of religious pluralism, each person has the right to define God in 
his or her own way, or to recognize no God. If that person finds no organized 
church that fills his or her need, he can form his own church. Taken to its 
ultimate, Thomas' position could lead, on the one extreme, to theocracy to 
restore order, or, on the other hand, to a complete breakdown and anarchy.

NEW YORK CARDINAL O'CONNOR'S WARNING TO CATHOLIC POLITICIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am outraged by the statements made by Thomas. Thomas has apparently forgotten 
that the mandate of a politician in the United States is not to enforce one's 
personally held religious beliefs on others, but rather to listen to one's 
constituents and reflect their opinions as their representative in government. 
</P>
<P>
It would be absurd to think that most of our Founding Fathers did not hold 
strong religious views. But these political architects of our nation knew that 
they did not have to "choose between God and the state" as Thomas says. They 
were wise enough to understand that "we, the people" did not all share the same 
theological thinking. Their credo, "separation of church and state" is a 
reminder to legislators of all beliefs that they are employees of the people. 
</P>
<P>
If they wish to be employees of God, then they are better suited to a life of 
pious servitude, but in no case should politicians succumb to O'Connor's 
despicable threats of excommunication by allowing his uncompassionate dogma to 
dictate legislation.

IMPROVING BUSING PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article on the failure of busing to raise the test scores of bused 
students opens the door to a practical alternative ("Minority Gains Limited in 
L.A. Busing Program," Part A, June 17). 
</P>
<P>
Why not spend the monies on busing for extra teachers and/or teachers aides to 
work with the students during the time they now spend being bused. 
</P>
<P>
This accomplishes several good things at the same time at no additional cost: 
1) extra time to learn, 2) supervisors to help offset the latch-key problem 
and, 3) a chance to develop friendships with the entire neighborhood after 
school hours. 
</P>
<P>
The management of time concept is what life is all about, more time to do both 
the things we should and want to do. Busing denies the use of optional time, 
where a child has the right to decide. Through a good selection of non-academic 
supervisors replacing bus drivers for this busing period we may find some 
favorable role models so often missed at home.

'St. Francis' Notes: Peter Sellars will direct and Jose Van Dam will star in 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic's performances of Olivier Messiaen's monumental 5 
1/2-hour opera, "St. Francis of Assisi" at the Salzburg Festival in 1992. The 
opera will be conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen, who will officially begin his 
tenure as the Philharmonic's music director in the fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Van Dam will re-create the title role he originated for the opera's Paris 
premiere in 1983 and the opera will be performed in Los Angeles after the 
Salzburg performance. The Philharmonic will also perform three concerts at the 
festival, two conducted by Salonen, and one by Pierre Boulez. The announcements 
were made at a Tuesday press conference in Los Angeles by Gerard Mortier, who 
will assume the directorship of the Salzburg Festival in 1992. GREG BRAXTON

On Broadway: A consortium of New York theater community members joined together 
Tuesday to form a plan to reduce ticket prices and costs so that more plays can 
be produced on Broadway. The plan, which will become effective Sept. 1, was 
announced in a New York press conference by the League of American Theaters and 
Producers, and the three major theater operating organizations -- Jujamcyn, 
Nederlander) and Shubert, as well as representatives from several unions and 
guilds. By reducing salaries and royalty payments, one-act plays with small 
casts can be produced for $400,000 under the plan, and offered to the public at 
prices ranging from $10 to $24. GREG BRAXTON

KID BEAT: MICHAEL HAGUE CREATES A PICTURE-PERFECT WORLD FOR CHILDREN; 
</P>
<P>
ART: THE STORYBOOK ILLUSTRATOR'S WATERCOLOR UNIVERSES ARE IN DEMAND BY GROWN-UP 
COLLECTORS. HIS PAINTINGS ARE BEING SHOWCASED IN HOLLYWOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A grinning triceratops lumbers down a flagstone path, guided by a pajama-clad 
teddy bear; goggle-eyed "zizzy" bugs flit on zigzag legs; under a midnight-blue 
sky, fragile-winged fairies in 18th-Century dress watch over a unicorn world. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Hague, one of America's foremost children's book illustrators, creates 
watercolor universes that appeal not only to readers of all ages, but to adult 
collectors looking for investments in a blossoming children's art market. 
</P>
<P>
Blending fantasy and realism, he illustrates original works and offers 
eye-catching new takes on children's classics from "Peter Pan" to "The Wizard 
of Oz." 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of Hague's paintings, soft and vivid watercolors finely detailed 
with pen and ink strokes, is being showcased at the Every Picture Tells A Story 
gallery in Hollywood through July 11. 
</P>
<P>
Hague, 41, a compact man with shoulder-length, graying brown hair and intense 
blue eyes, was on hand for the opening of the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't ever remember wanting to be anything but an artist or a baseball 
player," he said. "I was just better at drawing than I was at baseball." 
</P>
<P>
As a child, Hague's favorite artists were turn-of-the-century children's book 
illustrators: W. Heath Robinson, N.C. Wyeth and Arthur Rackham, among others. 
Disney was also "a great influence," as were "Prince Valiant" comic strips. 
</P>
<P>
But creating a new look for characters made famous in the drawings of Tenneil 
or in Disney cartoons is a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"The movie versions in particular are so familiar," Hague said. " 'The Wizard 
of Oz" or 'Peter Pan' -- you can't keep that out of your consciousness, but you 
try to re-read the book with a fresh mind and think (for example), 'What else 
could Alice (in "Alice in Wonderland") look like?' " 
</P>
<P>
Hague's approach seems to strike a chord with buyers. Marc Cheshire, Hague's 
agent in New York, said that sales of his client's 21 titles for Henry Holt and 
Company, "his main publishers," have reached 1.8 million "which for children's 
books in the $16.95 to $18.95 range is extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
With Hague's paintings individually valued up to $4,500, there's an 
"established market for Michael's work," Cheshire said, "but he doesn't want to 
see tremendous jumps in his prices. He has loyal collectors and he doesn't want 
to make it unaffordable for them." 
</P>
<P>
Abbie Phillips is co-owner of Every Picture Tells a Story, which exhibits only 
original children's book art. "We're still at the ground floor of what's going 
to be happening in this market," she said. "It's one of the last frontiers of 
collectible art forms. Within the last six months, prices have almost doubled; 
the year before that they'd increased 150%." 
</P>
<P>
Phillips sees Hague as "preeminent in reaffirming the classic tradition. So 
much of what's happening in children's illustration is pushing a limit with 
experimentation, techniques and levels of abstractions we've never seen 
before." 
</P>
<P>
Besides paintings and sketches, the gallery also carries several thousand books 
-- "as an art form in themselves," Phillips said, "and a reflection of what's 
happening on the walls." 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of the Los Angeles Art Center College of Design, Hague worked as a 
greeting card designer and in advertising until the demand for his book art 
took off "seven or eight years ago." Now, he lives and works at home in 
Colorado "on the side of a hill in the woods," with his wife Kathleen -- an 
author with whom he often collaborates -- and their three children, ages 6 to 
15. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hague's career took on a new dimension. When an ABC 
"thirtysomething" plot line made one of its female leads a children's book 
illustrator, the show needed to provide quality work that would be seen 
onscreen. 
</P>
<P>
"The script said the paintings should be 'Michael Hague'-like, and I guess they 
figured since he's still alive, why not give him a call," Hague said. He has 
done six paintings and sketches so far, "in various stages -- pencil and ink 
drawings and partial and finished color." 
</P>
<P>
To help make the character believable as an artist, producers often ask Hague's 
advice. "But they don't pay any attention," he said good-naturedly, pointing 
out that the character's desk remains neat and "mine is so messy." 
</P>
<P>
Publisher interest in his "thirtysomething" paintings of a comical troll and a 
little knight errant may result in a book. Meanwhile, the latest classic to 
receive the Hague treatment is Thorton W. Burgess's "Old Mother West Wind" and 
Hague has several other projects in the works, including illustrations for a 
new version of James Michener's "South Pacific."

RACISM: WILL HISTORY BURY IT?; 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE THE BLACK SHALL TO THE WHITE BE SISTER AND BROTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nelson Mandela, in his address to Congress on Tuesday, reminded us all of the 
power of American ideals to transform the world. In the process he may have 
gotten this country to reflect on a painful subject -- racism here. 
</P>
<P>
He saluted the lawmakers for signaling U.S. moral disapproval of apartheid and 
driving home that important message with economic sanctions imposed at a time 
when then-President Reagan was cozying up to South Africa's increasingly 
oppressive white minority regime. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela also praised the American philosophy of Thomas Jefferson for providing 
a blueprint for a united, democratic and nonracial South Africa. Mandela said: 
"We could not have known of your Declaration of Independence and not elected to 
join in the struggle to guarantee the people's life, liberty and pursuit of 
happiness." 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of millions of black South Africans, who "continue to bleed and 
suffer," Mandela demanded the ballot without regard to race, color, creed or 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of impoverished people who are denied the riches of their opulent 
land, he envisioned a strong and growing economy that would provide food, 
houses, education and health services in equitable measure. 
</P>
<P>
On behalf of black children crippled by legal restrictions based on color, he 
insisted on the transformation of a bitterly divided society "into an oasis of 
good race relations where the black shall to the white be sister and brother, a 
fellow South African, an equal human being, both citizens of the world." He 
also envisioned a government founded on a democratic constitution, the rule of 
law and a bill of rights enforced by an independent judiciary that would 
guarantee freedom and justice for all. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's vision serves as a moral prod that could force this great nation to 
focus renewed attention on its own problems. We have made so much progress, but 
we have so much more to do to achieve a total victory over racism not just 
abroad but at home as well.

MESSAGE TO MANDELA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN SULLIVAN, 20, a junior at Cal State Northridge, is a member of the Los 
Angeles Student Coalition, a group whose principal aim has been to support 
Nelson Mandela and the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. He told The 
Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(If I could speak with Mandela), I'd like to express the gratitude that young 
people feel throughout Los Angeles, from what I've seen over the past three 
years working with the Student Coalition -- just the almost universal support 
among young people for the struggle in South Africa. And I'd also like to 
discuss with him the relationship of how apartheid works in South Africa and 
how the not-so-blatant apartheid of our inner cities works, and stress the 
unity between Americans and South Africans to end everybody's oppression. 
</P>
<P>
He's been in prison for (27 years) years, and now is released, and is on the 
verge of seeing everything he's worked for, for his entire life, come around to 
this one moment. We, as students, never thought we would see this day. 
</P>
<P>
The destruction of people like Malcolm X and Martin Luther King has led to the 
fact that we've had to almost turn outside our own country to find somebody who 
is an inspiration.

MANDELA'S WAY: THE ROAD NOT TAKEN; 
</P>
<P>
COLD WAR POLITICS PUT U.S. AND SOUTH AFRICAN BLACKS ON DIVERGENT PATHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD HORNE, Gerald Horne is chairman of the department of black studies at 
UC Santa Barbara and author of Black and Red: W.E.B. Du Bois and the 
Afro-American Response to the Cold War, 1944-63 (State University of New York 
Press, 1986). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nelson Mandela is about to visit Los Angeles and the national NAACP leadership 
will meet here next week. These twin events put into focus the relationship 
between blacks in South Africa and in the United States. The differences in how 
these two communities have responded to racism extend far beyond the fact that 
one is an oppressed majority and the other is a discrete minority. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the Cold War was a significant factor in eroding Jim Crow in the 
United States and in encouraging the onset of apartheid in South Africa. How 
could Washington continue howling about human-rights violations in the Soviet 
Union when most African Americans could not vote or eat at certain lunch 
counters or be buried in some cemeteries? Simultaneously, Washington's search 
for allies in this global struggle allowed the ruling party in Pretoria to 
promulgate apartheid in 1948, proclaiming the African National Congress a 
veritable tool of Moscow. Then as now, the ANC was allied with the South 
African Communist Party and Washington lent a sympathetic ear to the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
The NAACP had not been indifferent to the U.S. Communist Party in the pre-Cold 
War era. Many of its leaders, especially Roy Wilkins, lent support to the black 
Communist lawyer Ben Davis when he was elected to the New York City Council 
from Harlem in 1943 and 1945. But unlike the ANC, the NAACP broke these ties in 
the postwar period; hence, founder W.E.B. Du Bois was ousted in 1948, the group 
supported wars in Korea and Vietnam and barred Communists from membership as 
part of a de facto Faustian bargain that led to concessions on civil rights. 
The ANC chose not to take this path. 
</P>
<P>
The consequences of the NAACP's choice resonate to this day. With the left 
still marginalized among blacks (not to mention the nation as a whole), black 
youth in particular face unpalatable choices. One is a pallid integrationism 
that has the virtue of organizing across racial lines. But the absence of 
militance provides little appeal for youth, who recognize that militance has 
historically been the engine bringing gains to our community. The other is a 
narrow nationalism, symbolized by the throngs greeting the Rev. Louis 
Farrakhan, that is verbally militant but is self-defeating in its lack of 
organization, a historical approach and chauvinism. Eastern Europe is now 
discovering the lesson learned ruefully by blacks, that decline of the left 
leads to the rise of narrow nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
Though racism in South Africa is more severe than it is here, Farrakhan's 
sexism and anti-white rhetoric would be viewed with far greater skepticism in 
Soweto. Similarly, the NAACP's anti-communism would receive outraged disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
When Mandela was freed, he singled out for special praise the Communist Party 
and its leader, Joe Slovo, who is of Lithuanian-Jewish descent and who has 
quite a following in black South Africa. Meanwhile, U.S. youth are captivated 
by rap groups like Public Enemy, which engage in anti-Semitic allusions. 
</P>
<P>
When the left was marginalized in the United States, along with it went the 
idea that racism stemmed from profit and the operations of a system. It became 
inevitable that blacks, seeking new explanations for their plight, would blame 
Euro-Americans as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC speaks explicitly of redistribution of wealth; despite the significant 
disparities of wealth that also exist in the United States, this demand is 
curiously absent from the agendas of most civil rights organizations. Indeed, 
the NAACP was reluctant to take up the cause of the anti-apartheid movement 
because of its allergy to the left, and relented only recently. 
</P>
<P>
It would be simpleminded to blame just the NAACP for this sad state of affairs. 
Powerful elites backed its leaders into this corner. But Nelson Mandela and the 
ANC also faced powerful enemies and decided to stare them down; now they are on 
the verge of taking over a government and a sizeable state-owned economy with 
the aim of improving the well-being of the black majority. Meanwhile, African 
Americans face an uncertain future as the scientific and technological 
revolution has undermined a major base of livelihood -- factory jobs -- while 
our crumbling system of education is not preparing blacks for an increasingly 
gloomy tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Mandela represents the road not taken, though it is still not too late 
for the NAACP and other civil rights organizations to learn from his example.

CAESAR, WHITFIELD CAN'T SAVE THE MUSICAL 'GOD'S TRYING' 
</P>

<P>
The production of Delilah Rashell Williams' gospel theatrical musical "God's 
Trying to Tell You Something" is touted as beginning a new era of theater 
presentations at the Palladium Hollywood. Before that can happen, some changes 
have to be made. 
</P>
<P>
Though the existing sound system may be perfectly acceptable for big dance 
bands and audiences who are primarily interested in moving to the beat, it is 
totally unacceptable for much of a theatrical presentation. There's a painful 
degree of distortion at any kind of volume, it fades to nothing below a shout, 
and both instrumental and vocal overtones constantly crash into each other in 
this acoustic wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
It also all but cancels out most of the effectiveness of the only two reasons 
for seeing this production -- gospel great and multiple Grammy winner Shirley 
Caesar and entertainer David Whitfield. The system can't begin to handle the 
subtle shadings and explosions of energy of these two performers. They try 
valiantly to surmount the sonic obstacles, but the system and its operators are 
against them. Caesar lights up the room whenever she walks onstage, and 
Whitfield keeps the crowd jumping; it would be nice to hear them other than 
through a pillow darkly. 
</P>
<P>
The opening night performance began an hour late, and the show -- apart from 
its technical difficulties -- wasn't worth the wait. Seen six months ago under 
the title "Black Folk in Song" at the Westwood Playhouse, it also bears a 
striking resemblance to "Voices," which played the Embassy Theatre earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Tied together by a narration that sounds mostly out of a textbook, the first 
act is a pageant of black history from pre-slavery up to the beginnings of the 
civil rights movement. The second act is a mishmash of pointless comic 
sketches, including carryings-on in church and at a Sunday picnic, and a kid 
who wants his mother to pay him for doing chores. 
</P>
<P>
It culminates in a lengthy series of middling impressions of memorable black 
performers, a stirring tribute to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s memory, and 
a stomping if loosely produced gospel finale. It's already been done, and 
better.

10 ARRESTED IN MASSIVE CREDIT-CARD SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Secret Service agents announced the arrests Tuesday of 10 suspects in one 
of the nation's largest credit-card scams -- a Los Angeles-based ring that 
allegedly rang up $2 million in cash and merchandise on stolen cards. 
</P>
<P>
The ring employed "shoppers," who would each charge $1,000 to $8,000 on 
fraudulent credit cards, either in merchandise or cash withdrawals from 
automated teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the shoppers went on weekend spending sprees to such vacation spots as 
Puerto Rico and Las Vegas, authorities said. Some held regular jobs and 
moonlighted for the fraud ring. 
</P>
<P>
Cards also were used by robbers, drug traffickers and other criminals to buy 
airline tickets or hotel rooms when they traveled to other cities, Secret 
Service officials said during a Los Angeles news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time the (Secret) Service has seen such widespread use of 
stolen and altered credit cards to facilitate violent crimes nationwide," said 
Secret Service Director John R. Simpson, who was joined by Dist. Atty. Ira 
Reiner and Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates in announcing the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said it was one of the largest credit-card scam operations his agents 
have encountered. 
</P>
<P>
The sophisticated ring employed Los Angeles street gang members, from both the 
rival Crips and Bloods factions, to run errands. Ringleaders referred to the 
gang members as "the South-Central labor pool," one agent said. 
</P>
<P>
The cards were obtained from an operative working in an Orange County plant 
that produces blank credit cards. The operative stole hundreds, perhaps 
thousands, of blank cards from the DataCard Corp. in Buena Park that were going 
to be destroyed because of imperfections, Reiner said. 
</P>
<P>
Another operative worked at one of the nation's largest credit bureaus, TRW 
Credit Data Division in Orange. She allegedly ferried out credit histories so 
that the ring could imprint the cards with the names and numbers of active 
credit-card holders. 
</P>
<P>
Other names were obtained by more conventional means, such as fishing 
carbon-paper imprints of credit-card purchases out of trash cans at rental-car 
agencies, said Richard J. Griffin, head of the Secret Service office in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
All of the suspects, including three alleged ringleaders, were arrested Monday 
night and early Tuesday by Secret Service agents after their indictment by the 
Los Angeles County Grand Jury. 
</P>
<P>
Among those arrested were Michael Smyer and Lydell Gordon, both of Los Angeles, 
who were being held in lieu of $1-million bail each. They were arraigned 
Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court on charges that included conspiracy to 
commit grand theft and forgery of a credit card. 
</P>
<P>
The names of the other suspects were not disclosed pending their arraignments. 
</P>
<P>
Agents displayed stacks of blank American Express cards, credit-card embossing 
equipment, drugs, guns and $18,000 in cash that were seized during the arrests 
and over the course of the 16-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said the 40-count indictment was the first obtained under provisions of 
Proposition 115, the so-called "Speedy Trial Act" passed by California voters 
on June 5. He credited the measure with speeding up the grand jury process, 
allowing his prosecutors to obtain indictments after 11 hours of testimony in a 
case that previously would have required a three-month preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The wide-ranging investigation, which officials hailed as a model example of 
cooperation between federal and local law enforcement, stemmed from a 1988 
holdup in Cincinnati, Ohio, and subsequent use of fraudulent credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
The ring used a variety of credit cards, although American Express and Bank of 
America suffered the heaviest losses from the operation -- a combined loss of 
about $1 million, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the 10 ring members who were indicted, another 50 suspects who 
allegedly used the stolen cards also were arrested over the course of the 
investigation on various charges. 
</P>
<P>
Both TRW and DataCard officials say they fired the employees they believed 
involved with the ring and cooperated in the investigation. A DataCard security 
official said the company, one of the largest makers of blank credit cards, has 
tightened procedures that account for all the cards it produces. He said the 
company has systems to track flawed cards that are destined for disposal.

RELATIVE FEW WILL GET TO SEE MANDELA; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. TOUR: A MAXIMUM OF ABOUT 100,000 PEOPLE WILL SEE THE SOUTH AFRICAN LEADER 
AT TWO PUBLIC EVENTS IN L.A. BUT FUND RAISING ON THIS STOP SHOULD BE A WINNER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Nelson Mandela's planned visit to Los Angeles is considered one of the most 
important stops on his U.S. tour, but the number of Angelenos who will get to 
see the South African anti-apartheid leader may be no more than saw him at a 
single street rally in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
If 30,000 people show up as expected to hear Mandela speak outside City Hall at 
noon Friday, and if the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is sold out for an 
evening rally, a maximum of about 100,000 people will see Mandela at the two 
events, the only ones open to the general public. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, close to a million New Yorkers saw Mandela during his visit to 
that city, 100,000 of them in Africa Square, a well-known intersection in 
Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles organizers concede that the numbers here will be small compared to 
some of the other stops on Mandela's eight-city U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
But they say that on another important measure -- fund raising -- the Los 
Angeles stop should be a winner. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles committee organizing the Mandela visit hopes to raise at least 
$1 million for the African National Congress, the organization of which Mandela 
is the deputy president. Similar goals were set for New York and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers point to several distinctions that separate Los Angeles from some of 
the other big-city stops on the tour -- distinctions that help contribute to a 
reduced crowd size. 
</P>
<P>
They note, for example, that no venue larger than the Coliseum was available in 
Los Angeles and that Mandela will be here for less than 24 hours, compared to 
three days in New York and two in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
They also noted that the largest crowd to date -- an estimated 750,000 people 
-- saw Mandela during a ticker-tape parade. No parade is planned for Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure we are a little disheartened. We wish 500,000 could see him in Los 
Angeles," said Darlene Donloe, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Nelson Mandela 
Reception Committee. "But we don't have a Popemobile and the Coliseum holds 
only so many people." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, comparative crowd size was of little concern to the local 
organizers and city officials as they began putting final touches on 
preparations for the Los Angeles stop -- the next to last for Mandela in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Those preparations included getting ready for the huge numbers of out-of-town 
and local journalists who will converge on the city to cover the event, making 
arrangements and contingency plans for what could turn out to be a massive 
traffic jam downtown during the City Hall speech and selling the remaining 
20,000 tickets for the Coliseum rally and concert. 
</P>
<P>
The rally will be preceded by a march down Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard by 
thousands of college and high school students. 
</P>
<P>
After an afternoon rest period, the 71-year-old ANC leader will attend a 
fund-raising dinner and reception at the Armory in Exposition Park. He will 
travel from there to the Coliseum rally. He leaves town the next morning, 
heading for Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The all-volunteer reception committee, which was formed six weeks ago by 
Assemblywoman Maxine Waters, will be Mandela's official host, but the city's 
office of protocol and Mayor Tom Bradley's office are in charge of the first 
half of Mandela's day in the city. 
</P>
<P>
That includes his scheduled 10:30 a.m. arrival at Los Angeles International 
Airport, his motorcade from the airport to City Hall, a brief welcoming 
ceremony in City Council chambers and his first speech in the city on the 1st 
Street steps of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's plane will land in a remote part of LAX for security reasons, airport 
manager Stephen Yee said. Only an official welcoming group and a limited number 
of journalists will be allowed near the plane. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the police motorcade and the activities at City Hall will be 
minimal, said Beatrice Canterbury Lavery of the office of protocol, and will 
come out of the city's general fund. 
</P>
<P>
The city is also providing police officers for traffic control and backup 
security throughout Mandela's visit, but Los Angeles Police Department 
spokesman Lt. Fred Nixon would not say exactly how many officers will be needed 
and how much it will cost the city. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 officers will be required for the Coliseum rally and the preceding 
student march, according to other estimates. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the LAPD's duties will involve handling traffic around City Hall and 
providing backup security for the U.S. State Department, which is in charge of 
Mandela's security while he is in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Ludlow, a union business agent who was tapped by the reception committee 
to "build" a crowd for the City Hall speech, said he and his volunteers will 
have passed out 300,000 flyers by the time Mandela arrives. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of Mandela's visit, Ludlow said, his volunteers will converge on 
City Hall from several directions in sound trucks, urging downtown workers and 
shoppers to go hear Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
Nixon of the LAPD said handling a crowd of 30,000 around City Hall would 
present no extraordinary problems for police. There are several contingency 
plans to handle traffic congestion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are 30,000 extra cars downtown, then you have a problem, but if that 
is not the case it shouldn't be too bad," he said. "No worse than Dodger Day or 
Laker Day." 
</P>
<P>
Vallee Bunting, a spokeswoman for Bradley, said 1st Street, Spring Street and 
one lane of Main Street will be closed to traffic throughout the morning and 
until after the City Hall speech ends. 
</P>
<P>
Some traffic problems will also be created by the 3.7-mile student march from 
Rancho Cienega Park, police said, but the scope will depend on the size of the 
crowd. The march is being organized by the Los Angeles Student Coalition and 
other groups. The park is in the 5000 block of Rodeo Road. 
</P>
<P>
The march is scheduled to end at the Coliseum about the time doors open for the 
rally. Because 20,000 seats will have to be removed for Mandela's security and 
to build a stage, 70,000 of the arena's 90,000 seats will be available. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd will be treated to a two- to three-hour concert featuring African, 
Caribbean and African-American music. 
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday, the list of confirmed acts included South African trumpeter Hugh 
Masekela, South African singer Letta Mbulu, and other gospel and rap 
performers. The program is being directed by television, movie and stage 
director Oz Scott and musician-composer Quincy Jones. 
</P>
<P>
The committee has asked local grass-roots organizations and churches to charter 
buses and buy blocks of tickets to be used by people who otherwise would not be 
able to afford the $10 ticket price. As of Tuesday, 50,000 tickets had been 
sold, Donloe said. 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Shockley, coordinator of the reception committee, said she expected a 
sellout for the rally. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Rapid Transit District last Friday announced that it 
will deploy 40 extra buses on five lines that run near the Coliseum to help 
carry people to the rally. 
</P>
<P>
Of the thousands who are expected to see Mandela during his Los Angeles visit, 
few will have an opportunity for a close-up view. 
</P>
<P>
Lavery will be the first city official to greet Mandela, joining him on the 
plane as she would a head of state. Assemblywoman Waters and Mayor Bradley will 
be at the head of the reception party greeting him on the Tarmac. 
</P>
<P>
At City Hall, City Council President John Ferraro will be waiting on the curb 
for the Mandelas to arrive. Inside City Hall, Mandela will meet briefly with 
the mayor and then rest before going into council chambers, where an estimated 
270 people are expected to gather. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood celebrities, Los Angeles politicians and religious leaders will be 
among the chosen few to sit beside Mandela when he makes his speech outside 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Gold-embossed invitations will admit 90 people to the VIP platform where 
Mandela and his wife will accept keys to the city from Bradley, Lavery said. 
Actor Gregory Peck will emcee a program featuring a gospel choir, Latino 
dancers and a Japanese drum band. 
</P>
<P>
There will be a limited number of seats for the public. 
</P>
<P>
At the Coliseum, a block of seats will be set aside for about 100 reception 
committee volunteers and about 1,000 big spenders who are expected to shell out 
from $1,000 to $50,000 to attend the Exposition Park reception and dinner.

EDELMAN BLASTS PROPOSED REMAP; 
</P>
<P>
REDISTRICTING: CONSERVATIVE SUPERVISORS PUSH PLAN TO SATISFY COURT AND PROTECT 
THEIR MAJORITY. APPROVAL IS EXPECTED TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
With a court-imposed deadline just hours away, a bitterly divided Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors is expected today to adopt a redistricting plan 
that would place liberal Supervisor Ed Edelman in a new, predominantly Latino 
district. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman broke his silence Tuesday to angrily denounce the plan, which he said 
is being pushed by the board's conservative majority. The board, after meeting 
behind closed doors, delayed a vote on a plan until this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Conservative Supervisors Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana said they expect the 
plan to be approved by a 3-2 vote. "The idea is to maintain our majority," Dana 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The board's third conservative, Pete Schabarum, would not say how he will vote, 
but remarked, "Mr. Edelman has been a target of mine for years." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors face a deadline of 3 p.m. today to submit a new redistricting plan 
to a federal judge, who ruled that current supervisorial district boundaries 
discriminate against Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
The plan under consideration Tuesday would expose Edelman, a 16-year board 
veteran, to a strong challenge from a Latino. It also would change the 
political representation for many of the county's 8 1/2 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman said he was hopeful of persuading his colleagues to approve an 
alternate plan that would expand the board from five seats to seven. "What 
they're doing is preserving the conservative majority at any cost," Edelman 
said angrily. "This is a sham. I can probably win (in the new Latino district). 
It's not going to lead to a Hispanic victory." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon has scheduled a July 5 hearing to decide 
whether to accept the plan. He has said that if the plan fails to correct the 
violations of the federal Voting Rights Act, he will redraw district lines 
himself after consulting with plaintiffs in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs -- the U.S. Justice Department, the Mexican American Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union -- have 
until the July 5 hearing to respond to the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon earlier this month ruled that the five Anglo supervisors intentionally 
discriminated against Latinos by drawing district boundaries in 1981 in a way 
that weakened the political influence of the county's 3 million Latinos. The 
supervisors, who have spent $4 million fighting the case, are appealing the 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Under the conservatives' proposal, a new Latino district, bearing the 
designation of Edelman's 3rd District, would stretch from El Sereno and Lincoln 
Heights through downtown Los Angeles, east to El Monte and San Gabriel and 
southwest to Montebello and Pico Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman referred to the new district as "octopus-shaped" because it would have 
tentacles reaching out from the Latino core around downtown Los Angeles into a 
number of neighborhoods. For example, Edelman said his Westwood home would be 
linked to the new district by a long "finger." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors refused to make the map public. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman complained that his colleagues sprung the map on him without warning at 
a closed-door meeting Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"They're doing a job on Ed," said Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who said he will 
stick with his fellow liberal in opposing any plan that places Edelman at 
political risk. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman said he favors carving out a Latino district from Schabarum's 1st 
District, noting that Schabarum is retiring. The conservative supervisors fear 
that such a move would tip the balance of power on the board. 
</P>
<P>
Dana said the supervisors delayed a vote until today "because we're still 
making minor adjustments." 
</P>
<P>
Edelman's district currently runs from heavily Latino East Los Angeles to 
affluent Bel-Air and includes portions of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Under the board's plan, Edelman would lose parts of the affluent and liberal 
Westside that form a large part of his political base. Those neighborhoods 
would be added to Dana and Hahn's districts. 
</P>
<P>
In such a new district, Edelman could face a strong challenge from a Latino. 
Los Angeles City Council members Richard Alatorre and Gloria Molina and U.S. 
Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) have expressed interest in running for 
supervisor in a new Latino district. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Antonovich would pick up San Fernando Valley neighborhoods from 
Edelman. Dana's district would extend into a small portion of the Valley for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs have asked Kenyon to throw out results of the June election for 
two supervisorial seats and schedule a November election in the new 1st and 3rd 
districts. If the judge agrees, filing for the seats would be reopened.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AGENCY REOPENS SHELTER AFTER ONE-DAY 
LOCKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Volunteers of America readmitted residents to its Women and Couples Shelter 
on Skid Row in Los Angeles Tuesday, ending a one-day lockout that was part of 
an effort to shut down its operations. 
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement between the nonprofit agency and the Inner City Law 
Center, representing about 20 residents who suddenly found themselves homeless 
on Monday, the residents will stay at the shelter at 611 E. 5th St. while VOA 
helps them find other housing. 
</P>
<P>
They also will receive financial assistance to relocate. 
</P>
<P>
Before the VOA reopened the shelter, the agency was strongly criticized by 
Mayor Tom Bradley, whose staff on Monday had found emergency housing for the 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
VOA Vice President Gerald McFadden called the situation a misunderstanding, and 
said, "We have always had a commitment to find comparable housing and provide 
some form of financial assistance" to the residents.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FRIDAY IS PROCLAIMED 'NELSON MANDELA DAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County supervisors voted Tuesday to welcome Nelson Mandela with a 
day in his honor, but one board member called on the black South African leader 
to repudiate his support of Yasser Arafat, Moammar Kadafi and Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich blamed the three leaders for much of the "bloodshed" 
in the Middle East and Africa, and urged the African National Congress leader 
to distance himself from them. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who introduced the motion, told Antonovich that 
Mandela has repeatedly explained his support of the Palestinian, Libyan and 
Cuban leaders. Mandela has noted that they supported the ANC at a time when few 
leaders in the world would. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the debate, the board voted to proclaim Friday -- when Mandela visits 
Los Angeles -- "Nelson Mandela Day."

BILL BOYARSKY: A VICTORY FOR THE MUMBLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The event rated only a small story in the paper: "Effort to Limit City 
Officials to Two Terms Abandoned." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, it was an intriguing bit of news. A group of activists fell short of 
obtaining enough signatures to place a two-term Los Angeles City Charter 
amendment before the voters in November. The failure didn't make sense. The 
ballot's always loaded with confusing, and often useless, measures. In a time 
of public outrage with City Hall, this particular proposal looked as if it 
should have been an electoral winner. 
</P>
<P>
I found the reason for its failure in Sacramento. There, the Legislature last 
year -- quietly -- enacted a law that effectively wiped out the term-limit 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
First, I've got to explain the law. In the past, to place a proposed charter 
amendment on a city ballot, you needed enough signatures on petitions to equal 
15% of the vote cast for governor in the last election. In Los Angeles, that 
amounts to 108,301 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
The new law changed that. It required 15% of all registered voters. Since 
gubernatorial voter turnouts are lower than voter registration, the bill had 
the effect of increasing the number of required signatures. In Los Angeles, it 
almost doubled to 205,448 signatures. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the L.A. term limit didn't learn about the change until they 
began circulating petitions. They continued the effort, but realized they'd 
never make 205,000 in time to make the November ballot. Last week, they gave 
up. Knowledgeable in Los Angeles in politics, they'd been stymied in Sacramento 
by one of the oldest tricks in the legislative business -- mumbling a bill 
through the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
You mumble when you want to sneak through something that wouldn't stand public 
scrutiny. You employ technical, sometimes impenetrable, language. The summary 
that accompanies each bill is vague and misleading. In explaining the bill to 
fellow lawmakers, you mumble that it makes "technical changes," or "eliminates 
obsolete language." Colleagues, with thousands of bills before them, usually 
take the explanation at face value and vote aye. 
</P>
<P>
I first encountered the phenomenon in the early 1960s when I was covering the 
state Assembly for the Associated Press. Tom Arden, a reporter for the 
Sacramento Bee, and I shared the job of sorting and digesting the many bills 
introduced each day. We received carbon copies of a brief summary of each bill 
-- scores of them on busy days. The summaries were often written in the most 
incomprehensible bureaucratese. If authors were skillful or lucky, nobody would 
notice the legislation and they'd be able to mumble it into law. 
</P>
<P>
Any time a suspected crook introduced something unintelligible, we'd check it 
out. That was time-consuming. For instance, we inquired about anything dealing 
with liquor, horse racing or oil. I'm sure we missed many a lemon. 
</P>
<P>
When the Legislature went full-time in 1968, it went in for more disclosure. 
Committee consultants, the legislative counsel and the legislative analyst all 
prepared thorough analyses of each bill. These were safeguards intended to 
prevent the old-time sneakiness. 
</P>
<P>
But they underestimated the power of mumblers, as the L.A. two-term limit 
people found out. 
</P>
<P>
The specifics of their downfall began with a seemingly sensible proposal from 
the League of California Cities, an organization of mayors and city council 
members. Laws governing local elections were scattered through the lawbook. The 
league proposed putting them all in the elections code. 
</P>
<P>
The league said it merely wanted to simplify the law. So did the legislator who 
introduced the bill on behalf of the league, Assemblyman Pete Chacon (D-San 
Diego). A mumble here, a mumble there, and it sailed into law. 
</P>
<P>
That it created an obstacle for city initiatives, the law's proponents said, 
was an unintended consequence. "It wasn't a conspiracy," Chacon said. "Lots of 
times, when legislation is enacted, we don't know the consequences." 
</P>
<P>
There's room, though, for a more skeptical analysis. A skeptic might wonder if 
there are mayors and city council members who wouldn't mind a third or fourth 
term. A skeptic, too, might wonder if there aren't some state lawmakers who 
would rather nip in the bud any movement toward a two-term limit. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the money the Legislature spends on staff members, no analysis of 
the bill mentioned the far-reaching change. And there was no debate. Chacon 
placed the bill on the "consent calendar," a list of presumably routine 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"It was passed on consent in both houses under false colors," protested Sen. 
Quentin L. Kopp, whose district includes San Francisco, another city where the 
bill interfered with a term-limit initiative. Kopp is trying to make San 
Francisco exempt from the new requirement, but Brown and Chacon have his bill 
bottled up in Chacon's committee.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY PRAISES JANITORS AS 3-WEEK STRIKE 
ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Century City janitors ended a strike Tuesday by ratifying a labor contract with 
a large cleaning company and then held a rally where Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley and Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky praised them for their resoluteness 
during the three-week work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
A tentative settlement negotiated Sunday means Service Employees International 
Union will represent approximately 500 janitors employed by International 
Service System Inc. in Los Angeles, including 180 janitors who work in 13 
office towers cleaned by ISS in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
Janitors will return to work Friday. The average janitor's pay will increase 
immediately from $4.50 an hour to $5.20, with health insurance and vacation 
benefits to start next spring, union officials said. "Fairness is all that has 
ever been requested . . . to bring about a living wage," Bradley told the 
rally.

HEROISM IS NO TICKET TO INFALLIBILITY;

FREEDOM FIGHTERS ARE OFTEN ILL-EQUIPPED FOR THE TASKS OF POLITICAL 
STATESMANSHIP.

<P>
Nelson Mandela deserves ageless respect for his 27 years of imprisonment on 
behalf of the anti-apartheid cause in South Africa. It is appropriate that this 
charismatic and widely acclaimed leader be welcomed and applauded as he tours 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Americans should have good reason to be concerned about Mandela's political 
judgment, the potential nature of his leadership and the advice that he is 
offering during his visit. Heroism does not confer infallibility. Nor should 
suffering for a noble cause obscure the wrongness of positions that are 
diametrically opposed to basic values held by the people of our country. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela and his Marxist-oriented African National Congress have repeatedly 
supported and engaged in terrorism. Both before and since Mandela's release 
from prison, his organization has compiled a brutal record of violence against 
both black and white civilians in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Mandela openly embraces notorious oppressors of human rights: 
Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat, Libyan dictator Moammar 
Kadafi and Cuban despot Fidel Castro. The reason for such embrace, Mandela 
tries to explain, is the long-standing support of the three for the ANC and its 
efforts to displace South Africa's ruling white regime. 
</P>
<P>
But that explanation is unsatisfactory. Expediency and the understandable need 
for support does not justify unholy alliance with those responsible for wanton 
murder and widespread violations of human rights. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's gratuitous relationships with such enemies of peace and freedom 
naturally arouse fears among South Africa's whites, coloreds, Indians and 
minority black tribes. Such alliances raise questions about whether Mandela's 
professed desire for political justice is genuine and cause suspicions that 
make peaceful constitutional compromise with South Africa's racial and tribal 
minorities more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's infatuation with "one-person, one-vote" sloganeering and his lack of 
accommodation for minority concerns is also antagonistic to the cause of 
political liberty in South Africa. Unchecked majoritarianism is a formula for 
tyranny over minorities. As James Madison explained: "In a society under the 
forms of which the stronger faction can readily unite and oppress the weaker, 
anarchy may as truly be said to reign as in a state of nature, where the weaker 
individual is not secured against the violence of the former." 
</P>
<P>
The founders of our Constitution went to great lengths to hold majoritarianism 
in check and to protect the rights of minorities. Hungary's newly revamped 
constitution offers special protections for Slovaks, Croats, Germans, 
Romanians, Serbs, Gypsies and Jews. Mandela's seeming indifference to similar 
protections against oppressive majority rule under new electoral conditions in 
South Africa suggests either unschooled political beliefs or nefarious 
political designs. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's economic philosophy and his commitment to Marxist ideology also raise 
concerns. His sympathy for nationalizing South Africa's banks, mines and other 
industries in order to transfer wealth from the white minority to the black 
majority defies historical philosophical justification. Mandela cannot point to 
a single nationalization program in the entire African continent, including 
Egypt's Suez Canal and Kadafi's oil expropriations, that has set the framework 
for long-term prosperity. Indeed, such confiscation has typically yielded 
economic calamity, as illustrated by Mozambique. 
</P>
<P>
Nations throughout Eastern Europe and South America are privatizing their 
economies en mass to escape the disastrous results of government control. Why 
is Mandela holding out against the lessons and tide of economic history? Is it 
because he wishes to reward ANC loyalists with lucrative positions in 
government corporations at the expense of the commonweal? Is it because he 
wishes to silence dissent to the ANC by making millions dependent on an ANC 
paymaster? 
</P>
<P>
To raise questions of Mandela's political acumen and intent is not to detract 
from his courage and accomplishments in assailing apartheid. It is rather to 
alert the United States and the world community that heroic freedom fighters 
are often ill-equipped for the tasks of political statesmanship when the 
fighting ceases. 
</P>
<P>
John Brown displayed comparable courage and passion in fighting slavery in 
Kansas and at Harpers Ferry, yet was utterly unsuited for a role requiring 
political vision and magnanimity, a task that was ultimately accomplished by 
Abraham Lincoln. Mandela has yet to distinguish himself from John Brown.

FROM LIP SERVICE TO DEBT SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, acting presidential, looking the fearsome federal deficit 
squarely in the eye and bowing to political imperatives, says he now accepts 
the need for "tax revenue increases." 
</P>
<P>
And, for the moment at least, Democratic leaders are showing their class by not 
gloating over this about-face. 
</P>
<P>
It is a measure of the gravity of the fiscal crisis that both sides are on 
their best behavior. 
</P>
<P>
No politician likes to vote for tax increases, and of course no voter welcomes 
them. The Democrats have said they won't take the heat for proposing 
unavoidable tax hikes. Bush has now made action on higher taxes and on cuts in 
spending a matter of bipartisan responsibility. That's as it should be. 
</P>
<P>
The brutal reality facing the negotiators is that next year's budget looks to 
be at least $160 billion in the red. 
</P>
<P>
Add to that the estimated one-year cost of cleaning up the S&amp;L mess and the 
deficit will almost certainly soar past $200 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Things could get worse. If the economy weakens, federal revenues will fall. If 
interest rates rise, Washington could be forced to spend even more than the 
staggering $152 billion now used to service the federal debt. 
</P>
<P>
The Gramm-Rudman law says the deficit for the new fiscal year that starts Oct. 
1 must be brought down to $64 billion or less to avoid triggering 
across-the-board budget cuts. That law may be changed in the course of the 
current negotiations, but even a higher permissible deficit will still force 
major spending cuts and significant increases in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
It won't be painless. A lot of people, a lot of congressional districts, a lot 
of special interests are going to be hurt. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiators have been at it for seven weeks and achieved virtually nothing. 
Now, maybe, the President has broken the impasse. But time is running out. 
Congress has only about 40 working days left before its scheduled recess, and 
there are scores of billions in spending cuts and tax hikes to be debated. 
</P>
<P>
With his turnabout, Bush may have removed a lot of the partisanship from the 
argument.

ETHICS BOARD UNPOPULAR IDEA AMONG SUPERVISORS; 
</P>
<P>
GRAND JURY: MAGGIE ERICKSON SAYS THE REPORT IMPLIES COUNTY WORKERS CAN BE 
INFLUENCED BY FOOD AND DRINK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday informally rejected a grand 
jury recommendation that an ethics commission be formed to write a code of 
conduct for county employees. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury, concluding its investigation into billionaire David H. 
Murdock's Sherwood Country Club project, on Monday criticized county officials 
for creating an "appearance of an impropriety" by attending a barbecue hosted 
by Murdock in 1989 -- before all aspects of the developer's project had been 
approved by the county. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors received the grand jury report Tuesday and may 
officially respond any time within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
But four of the board's five members said in interviews that they would not 
vote to create an ethics board, which was one of several grand jury 
recommendations related to the Murdock project. 
</P>
<P>
"What is being implied is that since county employees were treated to fine food 
and drink, everyone was inclined to look more favorably on a proposal. And I 
think that's preposterous," Supervisor Maggie Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
"If any of us is inclined in that direction, a barbecue isn't enough to do it," 
said Erickson, who did not attend the festivities at Murdock's Arabian horse 
ranch in Hidden Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Murdock's project, which calls for 650 houses and a golf course at Lake 
Sherwood near Thousand Oaks, was approved three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury noted, however, that several permit requests were still pending 
when the developer held the Sept. 30, 1989, barbecue to thank about three dozen 
county employees for their cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
The developer's controversial proposal to form a special district to tax area 
residents for millions of dollars in improvements at the lake still has not 
been voted on by the supervisors, the grand jury said. 
</P>
<P>
Though the grand jury found no illegality, it said a new commission is needed 
to draft "a countywide ethics ordinance to govern how county employees and 
officials should conduct themselves while conducting county business." 
</P>
<P>
Among the supervisors, only John K. Flynn tended to agree. He said that county 
employees, including several department directors involved with the project, 
should not have attended the barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't believe in that kind of stuff," Flynn said. "I think the public 
perceives something like that as being improper." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors Madge L. Schaefer, Susan K. Lacey and James R. Dougherty said they 
thought an ethics commission is a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
"Those have a life of their own," and can be used "for political mischief," 
Dougherty said. Lacey said the commission is not needed. 
</P>
<P>
"I go to barbecues hosted by the general contractors association, but I also go 
to open houses for nonprofit community groups who have contracts with the 
county," Lacey said. "I'm honest, so there's no problem." 
</P>
<P>
Schaefer, who was closest to the Murdock project because it is in her district, 
attended the 1989 barbecue and also held a political fund-raiser at Murdock's 
horse ranch in 1988. She said a county ethics code strict enough to keep her 
from attending the barbecue would also ban meetings with homeowners groups. 
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's board meeting, Schaefer lashed out at grand jurors in the 
audience, saying they had "played fast and loose with my reputation" for 
months. Schaefer's relationship with Murdock was probed by the grand jury, 
witnesses have said. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury cleared her of any wrongdoing in its report. But the angry 
supervisor told jurors: "I would like to see members of the grand jury subject 
to the same ethics commission." 
</P>
<P>
While the county's policy-makers expressed little interest in an ethics board, 
Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury endorsed the recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury, whose office was the grand jury's legal adviser on the Murdock 
investigation, said that "certainly the grand jury's recommendation that a 
strong ethics code be developed is warranted. It is clearly needed for elected 
officials on down." 
</P>
<P>
Bradbury would not elaborate, but he said he intends to continue his 
investigation into Murdock's activities here and in other states. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no reason to believe there was any criminal conduct involved," the 
prosecutor said, "but we do have some things we want to follow up. It involves 
checking on some of Murdock's previous business dealings as well as how he has 
conducted himself here." 
</P>
<P>
According to documents released by Bradbury's office after a request by The 
Times, Sherwood Country Club spent $5,195 to cater Murdock's 1989 barbecue, or 
about $68 for each of his 76 guests. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four county employees and 25 of their guests were invited, a guest list 
shows. Many of the employees were from the public works and planning 
departments, the agencies that had the most contact with the Murdock project. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Berg, county planning director, said that it "never crossed my mind" that 
anyone would question the propriety of county employees attending the barbecue, 
because the project had long been approved and its major permits issued. 
</P>
<P>
Berg said that he thought the barbecue drew the grand jury's attention partly 
because the county so rarely deals with major developments. The county's 
general plan restricts such projects to cities. 
</P>
<P>
An exception was made for the Sherwood Country Club because it was proposed as 
a way to solve sewer, water-supply and lake-maintenance problems for 122 
existing homeowners at Lake Sherwood, county officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
The conditions of the country club's 1987 approval were the focus of much of 
the grand jury's 22-page report. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury faulted county officials for an alleged lack of communication 
that could allow Murdock to sell Lake Sherwood for millions of dollars rather 
than give it away to a community group. 
</P>
<P>
The developer pledged the dedication of the lake three years ago when seeking 
project approval from the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury said that he first mentioned selling it in early 1988. But it 
was not until last month -- long after construction had begun at the country 
club -- that county officials sought to clarify Murdock's legal position on the 
lake dedication, the grand jury said. 
</P>
<P>
Out of its concern at such inaction, the jury recommended placing each major 
project under the direction of a manager who would track it from beginning to 
end. Most supervisors and several other county officials agreed Tuesday that 
such a reform would be a good idea if another large project is approved. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury was particularly caustic in questioning why some county 
officials support Murdock's pending proposal to form a special district to 
assess new residents -- and 122 existing homeowners -- millions of dollars to 
repay the developer for refilling and repairing Lake Sherwood. 
</P>
<P>
The panel said it saw no public benefit from such a district and that its 
creation would give Murdock "a method to induce, or perhaps even extort, the 
existing Lake Sherwood residents" into joining a separate lake-maintenance 
district made up primarily of buyers of his new homes. 
</P>
<P>
Murdock has offered to reimburse existing homeowners for their share of the 
cost of the lake if they will join the lake-maintenance district. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is expected to be forwarded next month to the supervisors, county 
Public Works Director Art Goulet said. 
</P>
<P>
Goulet said existing homeowners and about 50 undeveloped parcels outside 
Murdock's country club should be included in the lake-maintenance district 
because they receive benefits from it. 
</P>
<P>
Unless all residents who benefit from the private lake pay to maintain it, 
legal disputes are sure to arise, Goulet said. 
</P>
<P>
But Supervisors Flynn and Lacey said that when they approved the country club 
project, they understood that Murdock would restore the lake without cost to 
existing residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I voted for this project because it got rid of sewer and water problems and 
the lake was going to be given back to the people," Lacey said.

COUNCIL TO HELP FIND SITE FOR ZOE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following intense lobbying by Supervisor John Flynn, the Oxnard City Council 
voted unanimously Tuesday to help locate a permanent site for Zoe Christian 
Center, the county's only year-round homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
The center, which provides shelter and counseling for about 150 people a day, 
had been operating for five years on a temporary permit in an area zoned for 
industrial and manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
That permit expired last year. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the center had asked the council to permanently rezone the site 
at Rose Avenue and Fifth Street, allowing the center to remain at its current 
location. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that you will see the need to keep Zoe on this location," Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mayor Nao Takasugi and Councilwomen Ann Johs and Geraldine (Gerry) 
Furr said the location is inappropriate for the center because it is near a 
fertilizer company where toxic chemicals are stored.

<P>
Last year, Oxnard's assistant fire chief urged that the center be relocated 
because of its proximity to numerous industrial health hazards. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the center, including Councilman Manual Lopez and Councilwoman 
Dorothy Maron, said the current owner of the property is willing to sell the 
land for about $1 million, but Zoe Center needed the council's support to 
persuade various state agencies to grant the money to buy the land. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly three hours of debate and testimony, the council decided to help 
search for a permanent location but not to name the current location as the 
permanent site. 
</P>
<P>
Zoe Center officials said they will try to persuade the state agencies to 
provide the money to purchase another permanent site or to buy the current site 
and pay for measures to reduce the health hazards. HUGO MARTIN

WATER INITIATIVE FAILS TO QUALIFY FOR BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Ventura citizens group has failed to collect enough signatures to qualify an 
initiative for the November ballot that would have forced the city to build a 
$120-million pipeline to import state water from Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
But the group said it will now aim to turn in enough signatures to have a 
special election called on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are very much interested in seeing the pipeline built, but 
it's summer and many people are on vacation, and we just didn't have enough 
time to collect the signatures," said Jim Barroca, executive director of the 
greater Ventura Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Barroca is also a member of the executive committee of the Assn. for Quality 
Water Alternatives, the group behind the ballot initiative, whose members 
include many of the city's developers and business and real estate leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The group had until 5:30 p.m. Monday to gather 7,500 signatures, or 15% of the 
electorate. The initiative drive started May 21, but fell 500 signatures short 
of the required number, AQWA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the group missed the deadline for the November ballot, it still has 
until Sept. 20 to qualify the measure for a special election, said Ventura City 
Clerk Barbara Kam. A special election would be held 88 to 103 days after the 
signatures are turned in, she said. 
</P>
<P>
AQWA officials said they will meet Thursday to decide whether to continue the 
initiative drive, and most of its leader have said they will. 
</P>
<P>
The city is paying for a study on the cost and feasibility of building the 
pipeline, which would connect Ventura to the state water project at Lake Piru 
or Castaic Lake. Council members have refused to put the issue on the ballot 
until that study is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The special election would cost about $30,000 and Ventura taxpayers would have 
to foot the bill, Kam said. She said a November ballot would cost about half as 
much as a special election. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Gary Tuttle, a pipeline opponent, reacted angrily to AQWA's 
announcement of its intention to call for a special election. "When a 
special-interest group makes a city spend money on something it is already 
working on, I have a problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuttle said he was equally opposed to the possibility of cutting that cost by 
having the council place the initiative on the November ballot. "That's 
blackmail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Todd Collart, who is undecided about state water, as is the majority 
of the council, said "This is a no-win situation. We'll have to find a third 
alternative." SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

CITY TO RECONSIDER BIKE LANE DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three months after the Camarillo City Council spent $6,200 to paint bike lanes 
along a half-mile stretch of Temple Avenue, council members will decide today 
whether to spend $7,000 to have them removed. 
</P>
<P>
School officials and representatives of the Camarillo Baseball and Softball 
Assn. and the American Youth Soccer Assn. have complained that the bike lanes 
have created a severe parking shortage in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Parking is prohibited in bike lanes by state law. 
</P>
<P>
"By eliminating all the parking on the street, parents attending our games will 
be forced to park further away and walk a half-mile or more from their cars," 
said Gary Gasperino, president of the Camarillo Baseball and Softball Assn. He 
has asked the city for an exemption from the no-parking rule. 
</P>
<P>
According to the state vehicle code, cars cannot legally park in a bicycle lane 
and exemptions are not allowed. "It's like saying you can temporarily park in 
the middle of an intersection. Simply put, it's against the law," City Engineer 
Dan Greeley said. CAROLYN KUSKY

PORTER RANCH FOES PLAN LAST-DITCH FIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE OPPONENTS CONCEDE THAT IT'S PROBABLY TOO LATE TO PERSUADE THE 
CITY COUNCIL TO REJECT THE $2-BILLION PROJECT. 
</P>

<P>
Neighborhood opponents of the massive Porter Ranch development in Chatsworth 
gathered Tuesday evening to organize a last-ditch campaign to lobby Los Angeles 
City Council members to reject the project next week, but conceded that it will 
probably be in vain. 
</P>
<P>
If a down-to-the-wire campaign of post cards and phone calls cannot defeat the 
proposal, they will continue the fight in court, leaders of the group said. 
</P>
<P>
About 75 residents -- some holding babies in 90-degree temperatures at 
non-air-conditioned Castlebay Lane Elementary School -- agreed that it is 
probably too late to influence the City Council before its vote Tuesday on 
Porter Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Hal Bernson wields "Napoleonic" control over the council on the 
Porter Ranch issue, said Don Worsham, a member of PRIDE, a homeowners group 
opposed to Porter Ranch. Any substantive change would have to come through 
Bernson, the proposal's chief political supporter, Worsham said. 
</P>
<P>
Land set aside for school use is likely to be the only aspect of the plan 
Bernson will agree to change, Worsham said, and "that issue is being used to 
divert attention from other important issues like air quality, water and 
traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Porter Ranch, if approved, would be a $2-billion project to be built over 20 
years in the hills of Chatsworth north of the Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The development would include 3,395 residences and six million square feet of 
commercial and retail space. 
</P>
<P>
Shapell Industries, headed by Beverly Hills builder Nathan Shapell, and Liberty 
Buildings Inc. are equal partners in the Porter Ranch Development Co., the 
project's primary developer. 
</P>
<P>
The South Coast Air Quality Management District strongly objected initially to 
the 1,300-acre development on the grounds that by creating an estimated 21,000 
jobs, it would contribute to poor air quality and possibly exacerbate traffic 
congestion in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The AQMD relented after the development company trimmed the project, which 
initially called for 7.7 million square feet of commercial space, and added 
more condominiums and apartment buildings to better balance the new jobs and 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson, whose district encompasses Porter Ranch, has supported the revised 
plan, increasing the likelihood of its passage by the full council Tuesday. 
Council members have rarely interfered in land-use issues in other members' 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
Julie Korenstein, a West Valley school board member, has repeatedly clashed 
with Bernson over the school issue, demanding that the developer set aside a 
seven-acre site for an elementary school and a 15-acre plot for a junior high 
school. The current plan says the developer needs to save the elementary school 
site for only 10 years, and could reserve a site for a future junior high 
school.

MERGER OF HEALTH CLINICS APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a plan to 
consolidate eight health clinics and to establish a new branch of a mental 
health outreach program in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, eight clinics in Oxnard will be consolidated into one at the 
Centerpoint Mall at Saviers Road and Channel Islands Boulevard. The new clinic 
is expected to open early next year. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was praised as "exactly the kind of thing we need" by Supervisor 
Maggie H. Erickson. "It makes sense from the point of view of the clients and 
from the point of view of the clinics," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the eight clinics serve residents of Oxnard, Port Hueneme and Camarillo 
by providing immunizations, family planning services and treatment for sexually 
transmitted diseases. The two other clinics, which provide a range of medical 
services in south Oxnard and the La Colonia neighborhood, may remain open after 
the consolidation, said Phillipp K. Wessels, director of the County Health Care 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
The new clinic at the Centerpoint Mall will also offer prenatal and pediatric 
care, sparing women and children in need of such care from having to travel to 
the County Medical Center in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Wessels estimated the cost of converting two former stores in the mall to be 
about $950,000. The funds will be provided by Ventura County Medical Center 
revenues and other funds already allocated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors also approved the leasing of a former J.C. Penney store at 555 
S. A St. in Oxnard to house a team from the Mental Health Department's Small 
Community Outreach Treatment and Support, or SCOTS, program. 
</P>
<P>
Four teams now serve Oxnard as part of SCOTS, which is funded by a $16-million 
state grant for the development of outreach systems, said Dr. Duane Essex, the 
department's deputy director. JACK SEARLES

PARENTS ADMIT HELPING SON HIDE AFTER SLAYING; 
</P>
<P>
PLEA BARGAINS: THE COUPLE AIDED JOEY PAUL BELLINGER, WHO WAS CHARGED WITH 
MURDER IN THE SHOOTING OF TWO DEAF BROTHERS. HE WAS ARRESTED AFTER FLEEING TO 
UPSTATE NEW YORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The parents of Joey Paul Bellinger admitted Tuesday that they helped their 
16-year-old son flee to Upstate New York to avoid prosecution on murder charges 
for the shooting of two deaf Palmdale brothers in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Paul Bellinger Sr., 40, and Phyllis Mary Goodman, 37, of Long Beach, in 
a deal with prosecutors, entered pleas in Long Beach Municipal Court to charges 
of aiding and abetting a suspected felon -- their son, who was charged with 
murdering Cesar Vieira, 30, and wounding Vieira's brother, Edward, 25. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the couple advised their son not to turn himself in to 
authorities after the shootings in January, then arranged for him to stay with 
a longtime friend in the tiny community of Cassville, N.Y., where he was 
arrested by FBI agents a month later. 
</P>
<P>
Bellinger's father pleaded no contest to the charge as a felony, which carries 
a maximum sentence of three years in prison. Goodman pleaded guilty to the same 
offense as a misdemeanor, which has a maximum penalty of a year in County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
But under terms of a plea agreement reached with defense attorneys, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Alan C. Fork said he will ask the judge to sentence Bellinger to 30 
days in County Jail and three years probation, and to grant Goodman probation 
with no jail time. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Denis K. Petty said the relatively lenient plea agreement 
was reached because the couple's actions "sprung from the normal human emotions 
of parenthood." 
</P>
<P>
Bellinger's defense attorney, Jeffrey Le Beau, said the couple never intended 
to shield their son from prosecution indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
The couple, whose daughter, Michelle, was raped and murdered in 1987 at age 16, 
wanted guarantees that their only surviving child would be tried as a juvenile 
rather than as an adult, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Bellinger's father briefly tried to negotiate a surrender for his son with 
police, but authorities refused to promise a juvenile court trial. A Sylmar 
Juvenile Court judge has ordered a July 9 hearing on prosecution arguments that 
the teen-ager should stand trial as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
"This is their last child and I think that they felt they were in a very, very 
difficult position," Le Beau said. "They were under a lot of stress and 
whatever they did, they did out of love for their son." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Le Beau said, the 15-year-old who was convicted of murdering 
Michelle Bellinger was tried as a juvenile and will be freed from custody at 
age 25. If Bellinger, now in custody at Aylmar Juvenile Hall, is convicted of 
murder as an adult, he could be sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses to the Jan. 28 shooting said Bellinger fired five shots from a 
handgun at the two deaf brothers, who were on a motorcycle, after a 
confrontation at a traffic light. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began when Bellinger "threw up a gang sign -- a K for Kaos," which 
stands for Kids Against Our Society, and the brothers responded with insulting 
gestures and by spitting on their car, said other occupants of the car carrying 
Bellinger. Both vehicles pulled into a parking lot so the boys could fight, and 
suddenly Bellinger started firing, the witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
As the car sped away, Bellinger screamed "I smoked him, I smoked him," 
witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Within days, Bellinger fled to New York, where he stayed with Goodman's high 
school friend, Susan Alguire, who said Goodman asked her to provide temporary 
shelter for her son without telling her that he was wanted by police. 
</P>
<P>
Phone records obtained by police indicate that both parents maintained contact 
with their son while he was in hiding.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL OFFERS REWARD IN SEPULVEDA SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council offered a $25,000 reward Tuesday for the arrest 
and conviction of the killer of a Sepulveda woman who was stabbed to death in 
her home Dec. 7 as she returned from a Christmas shopping trip. 
</P>
<P>
The offer was made for the killer of Nancy Gail Brontson, 50, who apparently 
was slain by a burglar -- or burglars -- she surprised in her home, according 
to a news release issued by Councilman Hal Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
Bernson, who represents the Sepulveda area, proposed the reward. 
</P>
<P>
Police found no signs of forced entry at the Brontson residence. The dead 
woman's 1981 Cadillac was later found parked at the Van Nuys Swap Meet, Bernson 
said.

RAMON REACHI; RETIRED DANCER, RESTAURATEUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ramon Reachi, a professional dancer who operated a restaurant in Santa Monica, 
has died in Woodland Hills. He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
Reachi, with his wife, Renita, appeared in "Gold Diggers of 1935," preforming 
an exaggerated ballroom dance to the tune of "Lullaby of Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
In later years, he opened the Macayo, a Santa Monica restaurant that featured 
live entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
He died Monday of cancer, said his daughter, Reni Churchill. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Mexico City, Reachi took up dancing at 16, shortly before coming to 
California with two of his brothers. He and his wife appeared in numerous films 
and on stage for about 30 years, performing Latin and ballroom-style dancing. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1930s, he opened a restaurant in New York. He later moved to 
California and opened the Wilshire Boulevard restaurant. He also started a 
candle-making factory in North Hollywood called Cafe Candlelight that made 
personalized, silk-screened candles for restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
He later worked for several Los Angeles hotels, managing the catering 
departments until he was 85. For several years, Reachi swam every day at the 
YMCA in North Hollywood until retiring two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by daughter Reni Churchill of Woodland Hills; a son, Rudy Reachi 
of North Hollywood; brothers Alex Reachi of Santa Monica, Luis Reachi of Marina 
del Rey and Santiago Reachi of Santa Ynez; a sister, Josephine Reachi of Santa 
Monica, and three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service is scheduled for 2 p.m. Friday at Gates, Kingsley &amp; 
Gates Funeral Directors, 6909 Canoga Ave., Canoga Park, which is handling the 
arrangements. Burial will be private. Donations can be made in Reachi's name to 
the American Cancer Society or the City of Hope.

WILLIAM LESLIE OLSEN; RETIRED BANK PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Leslie Olsen, retired president of City National Bank in Beverly Hills, 
has died at his Woodland Hills home. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen spent 29 years with the bank and served as president from 1974 to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen died Sunday of lung cancer, said his son, Michael Olsen. 
</P>
<P>
Born Jan. 19, 1919, in Grand Rapids, Mich., Olsen was raised on the South Side 
of Chicago. He served as a bombardier in the Air Corps during World War II. His 
plane was hit by enemy fire on New Year's Eve, 1943, during a raid on 
Ludwigshafen, Germany, and landed in a pasture in France. He spent the next 
months assisting the French underground, then made his way to British-held 
Gibraltar, before he was transferred to Ontario, Calif., to train pilots. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen started his banking career with Union Bank in Los Angeles in 1948 as an 
assistant vice president and loan officer. He went to work as a vice president 
for City National Bank in 1957, working his way up to president. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen was past director of the California Bankers Assn., executive director of 
the Foundation for the Junior Blind in the early 1980s and a longtime member of 
the El Caballero Country Club in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>

Mark McMonagle, 20, of Philadelphia, was convicted of murder in causing the 
death of Leila Diaz de Panay, 50, who was struck by bullets in her home Jan. 
25. The bullets were fired while McMonagle was helping stage a fake fire fight 
in order to cover the fact that co-defendant Sgt. Paul Finsel had lost his Army 
pistol in a nearby brothel. McMonagle was convicted after a two-day 
court-martial of murder, conspiracy, conspiring to obstruct justice, impeding 
an investigation and disobeying orders not to drink alcohol, have sexual 
contact with Panamanian women, load bullets or discharge a firearm in an 
endangering way. McMonagle, who could be sentenced to life in prison, is to be 
sentenced today. The court-martial of Finsel, 25, of Arkoma, Okla., begins 
Friday.

SIRHAN DENIED 13TH PAROLE BID

<TEXT>
<P>
Sirhan B. Sirhan, who shot Sen. Robert F. Kennedy to death 22 years ago, was 
denied freedom for the 13th time by a parole board that disregarded a Middle 
Eastern petition pleading for his release. After a hearing of more than five 
hours at Soledad State Prison, Sirhan was told his next parole hearing would be 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner David Brown, one of the three members of the Board of Prison Terms 
who sat in judgment of Sirhan, said parole was denied "because the prisoner 
committed a political assassination, which is unique in American history." 
Sirhan, now 46, was convicted of gunning down Kennedy on June 5, 1968, in Los 
Angeles' Ambassador Hotel. Government officials and educators in the Middle 
East had asked the parole board to release Sirhan, whose lawyer said the 
officials suggested that Sirhan's release could speed peace in that region of 
the world.

USC LANDS CITY CO-MVP MCMACKIN

Reed McMackin, who helped lead Chatsworth High to a City Section baseball title 
this year, signed a national letter of intent Tuesday with USC. 
</P>
<P>
McMackin accepted a partial scholarship, choosing USC over UC Riverside and 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-1, 190-pound right-hander also played first base at Chatsworth but 
will concentrate on pitching at USC. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to the USC campus this month pushed McMackin into the Trojan camp, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in awe with all the tradition that goes with the school," he said. "It 
was like walking through history. They have a great baseball program and offer 
a great education. It seemed like the best opportunity for me." 
</P>
<P>
McMackin posted a 12-2 record with a 1.98 earned-run average this year and set 
school records for wins in a season and a career (22). He also batted .402 with 
28 runs batted in this year and shared the 4-A Division player of the year 
award with El Camino Real's Pat Treend.

MCKINNEY TAKES A STEP ON THE COMEBACK TRAIL

When you see 12-21-1 listed next to a boxer's name, you know he's either a very 
bad boxer or someone inadvertently listed the guy's gym locker combination in 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Jorge Rodriguez of Bell, however, neither was true. He did lug 
that incredibly bad record into the ring on Tuesday night at the Country Club 
in Reseda. But shockingly, he was not a bad fighter. 
</P>
<P>
He merely was not as good as Kennedy McKinney. 
</P>
<P>
McKinney, the 1988 Olympic gold medalist as a bantamweight before his pro 
career was shelved for a year because of a drug addiction, pounded out a 
unanimous eight-round decision over Rodriguez in the main event. 
</P>
<P>
The fight had no stirring moments. It had no memorable moments. What it did 
have was McKinney, 126 1/2 pounds, consistently beating Rodriguez, 129, to the 
punch and scoring a shutout, winning every round. 
</P>
<P>
McKinney is 10-0-1. 
</P>
<P>
In the most exciting bout of the night, Joey De Grandis of Boston, now living 
in Los Angeles and being trained and managed by the Ten Goose Boxing Club of 
Van Nuys, scored a unanimous four-round decision over Jason Burrel of Corona in 
a super middleweight bout. 
</P>
<P>
De Grandis, making his pro debut after winning the New England Golden Gloves 
championship twice, pounded Burrel with heavy punches in every round, but 
Burrel responded with his own heavy punches and the two often stood toe-to-toe, 
tagging each other with thudding blows. 
</P>
<P>
In another wild bout, David Kamau of Kenya, now living in Los Angeles, improved 
his record to 6-0 by stopping Alan McMasters of Los Angeles 49 seconds into the 
fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
In other bouts, Larry Loy, 128, of Van Nuys, scored a four-round unanimous 
decision over Mark Jenkins, 125, of San Diego. Loy is 2-0. Also, Derrick Ryles, 
222, of Huntington Beach scored a four-round split decision over 255-pound 
William Morris of Ontario and Eddie Cook, 118, of Las Vegas ran his record to 
6-0 by stopping Francisco Peralta of Bell in the third round.

NAVY LOWERS THE BOOM ON 2 LIVE CREW; 
</P>
<P>
RAP: FIVE NAVAL BASES IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO STOP 
SELLING ALL OF THE GROUP'S RECORDINGS.

The Marine Corps isn't the only U.S. military branch in Southern California to 
restrict the sale of rap group 2 Live Crew's sexually explicit album, "As Nasty 
as They Wanna Be." 
</P>
<P>
Following the lead last week of Marine officials at Camp Pendleton near 
Oceanside, U.S. Navy officials confirmed Tuesday that five naval bases in the 
San Diego area have been instructed to stop selling the "Nasty" album. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences announced plans 
at a press conference Tuesday in New York to stage an artists and musicians 
march on Washington later this summer to demonstrate the music industry's 
support for 2 Live Crew. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, Chief Petty Officer Martin Wicklund, a spokesman for the Naval 
Base there, said that the Fleet Support Office (the agency that oversees all 
Navy exchange operations in San Diego) has directed base commanding officers to 
remove the Miami rappers' controversial "Nasty" album, as well as all 2 Live 
Crew recordings. 
</P>
<P>
The decision covers exchange outlets at Miramar, North Island, Naval Station 
San Diego, Naval Training Center and the Naval Outlying Landing Field at 
Imperial Beach. 
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday, the album was still available to sailors in Long Beach and San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Cmdr. Steven Chesser, a spokesman for the Long Beach Naval Station, said 
that the Long Beach exchange officer has not been instructed to remove the 
album. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Chief Petty Officer Erik Erickson, head of media relations for the Naval 
Base in San Francisco, said that none of the 17 major naval installations in 
the San Francisco area has been directed to remove the album. 
</P>
<P>
At a New York press conference, Stu Ginsburg, president of the recording 
academy's New York Chapter, read from a statement by Michael Greene, the 
academy's president, which called the arts "the latest political target du jour 
of the right-wing fear mongers." 
</P>
<P>
Ginsburg said that the academy -- which also sponsors the annual Grammy Awards 
-- plans to approach other arts-related groups about participating in what is 
being conceived as a daylong event, including a concert, to draw attention to 
the many debates over the arts that are now taking place in the courts and 
legislative halls. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, U.S. District Court Judge Jose Gonzalez of Ft. Lauderdale, 
Fla., acting on a civil complaint, declared the "Nasty" album obscene, making 
it the first recording ever to be declared so in a federal court. 
</P>
<P>
A Ft. Lauderdale record store owner was subsequently arrested for selling the 
album, and three members of 2 Live Crew were later arrested for singing 
material from the album at an adults-only concert in Hollywood, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few artists who showed up for the New York press conference, 
Hurricane of the rap group The Afros, spoke for many rap musicians when he 
said, "Instead of doing drugs and the real bad, bad, bad things, we do the 
music -- and we still get arrested." 
</P>
<P>
In his written statement, Greene said, "Rap and metal music are under siege and 
we must make Americans understand that these are the primary communication 
mediums to and from the youth and repressed segments of our population. We 
should be celebrating the success of these musical provocateurs and not 
attempting to crush them." 
</P>
<P>
Reached later at his office in Burbank, Greene said that numerous musicians 
have contacted the academy in the wake of the obscenity ruling in Florida, 
asking what they could do to help. The march and concert are a response to that 
show of interest, he said.

With "Cheers" pulling down the No. 1 honors as most-watched program of the 
week, NBC handily disposed of its competitors in the prime-time ratings derby 
last week. Figures released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. gave NBC its 37th 
victory in the past 40 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
ABC finished second but got disappointing results from its two prime-time game 
shows. In their second week in the Saturday lineup, both "Super Jeopardy!" and 
"Monopoly" lost their time periods against reruns on NBC and CBS. Fox, 
meanwhile, had three shows in the top 14: "The Simpsons," "Married . . . With 
Children" and "In Living Color." The full list of ratings is on Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
* Are Americans less interested in Nelson Mandela than the news media think? Or 
was it simply that they'd already seen enough of him on the evening news that 
day? Whatever the answer, one thing is clear: They didn't turn out in droves to 
see him during a prime-time interview on "The Koppel Report" last Thursday. The 
program was seen in about 4.3 million homes, compared to about 11.2 million for 
a rerun of "L.A. Law" on NBC and about 7.5 million for a rerun of "Wolf" on 
CBS. It ranked 81st among the week's 86 prime-time programs.

KCET BOARD APPROVES $47.8-MILLION BUDGET, A 7.6% INCREASE; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: CHANNEL 28 ALLOCATES MORE FUNDS FOR PBS PRESENTATIONS, BUT MAY CUT 
SOME LOCAL PROGRAMS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Battling an economic slowdown that has put a crimp in corporate giving, the 
board of directors at KCET Channel 28 on Tuesday approved a budget for next 
year that will keep the Los Angeles public-television station barely a 
heartbeat ahead of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
While it appears that, overall, KCET will have enough money to keep up at least 
its current levels of activity, changes in the manner in which the station 
allocates funds means that some programs targeted for the Southern California 
audience, such as "The Los Angeles History Project," may be cut back or 
discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
The station's directors approved a budget of $47.8 million for fiscal year 
1991, which begins July 1. The new financial plan gives the station 7.66% more 
money than last year's budget of $44.4 million, but keeps it just 1.86% ahead 
of inflation, which so far this year has been running at 5.8%. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a lot more than inflation," conceded KCET President William Kobin, 
but station officials nonetheless said that they were "delighted" that funding 
and revenues have increased as much as they have. Just five years ago, KCET was 
in severe financial trouble, with a budget half the size of the one planned for 
next year and a mass of red ink. 
</P>
<P>
The 1991 budget allocates increased funds for the production of programs 
designed for national presentation on the Public Broadcasting Service, but 
money for local shows remains fairly flat, said Kobin, who would not release 
specific figures on the allocations. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the rise is money spent for development (a euphemism for fund-raising), 
marketing, advertising and public information and outreach, Kobin said. 
</P>
<P>
Kobin said that KCET is allocating about $250,000 more toward local programming 
this year than it did last year, but overall spending on local production will 
be somewhat lower because a grant to produce "The Los Angeles History Project" 
is running out. 
</P>
<P>
KCET plans to produce four new installments of "The Los Angeles History 
Project" for its third season, said Stephen Kulczycki, senior vice president 
and station manager. 
</P>
<P>
Production of "Take Five," a series of five-minute programs on the arts, 
culture and science, will also be cut back. Instead of the 25 installments 
produced this year, the 1991 budget calls for only 10. 
</P>
<P>
Unless more money is raised from donors who specifically want to fund "The Los 
Angeles History Project" or "Take Five," they will not continue beyond the end 
of 1990, Kulczycki said. 
</P>
<P>
KCET will, however, continue producing its Emmy Award-winning local 
public-affairs series "By the Year 2000." It also plans several programs about 
the Los Angeles Festival and will produce a program on fire prevention along 
the lines of its earthquake preparedness show, "Surviving the Big One." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the station plans to increase production of programs aimed at 
a national audience, Kulczycki said. 
</P>
<P>
Those programs -- which include installments of "American Playhouse" and a 
science series called "The Astronomers" and a ballet about the life of Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. -- not only bring prestige and viewers to KCET, he said, 
but also help pay for themselves through the fees paid by other stations to air 
them. KCET also can make money by selling videotapes of the shows. 
</P>
<P>
The flat local production budget contrasts sharply with the station's fund for 
building improvements. On Monday, KCET broke ground on a four-story parking 
structure at its Hollywood studios. Construction of the garage marks the first 
phase in the station's $50-million "Campaign for KCET," which is also designed 
to provide a new production services center and a broadcast center. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between the two budgets highlights a shift in the station's 
fund-raising philosophy: Kobin and his staff have been working for several 
years toward a system whereby potential donors are solicited to provide help 
with specific projects, instead of simply granting money to be used at KCET's 
discretion. 
</P>
<P>
The buildings, in other words, are being funded with money specifically raised 
for that purpose, money that the donors have said may only be used to upgrade 
the station's facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Under this system, which involves an increased use of what is known in 
public-television jargon as "restricted funding," new programs will 
increasingly be made using money specifically donated for that program. 
</P>
<P>
Similar shifts are taking place throughout public broadcasting, with station 
managers reasoning that this way, the programs pay for themselves. The money 
donated on an unrestricted basis from viewer memberships and other sources can 
be used for projects that are more likely to generate income for the station. 
</P>
<P>
"You really need to see that big picture," Kulczycki said. "We're not producing 
those national programs because we want to put the money in a retirement fund 
in Tahiti. We're doing it so we can break even on our programming. It's all 
tied together." 
</P>
<P>
The new policy does not mean that all money for production will come from 
restricted grants -- just that more of it will. In fact, restricted funds as a 
percentage of the 1991 budget for local programming have increased by only 2%, 
Kobin said.

<P>
Tying production more closely to fund raising makes the budget less flexible, 
Kobin said, but it steadies the station's finances at a time when money is 
increasingly tight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mixed blessing, but it's a price we're willing to pay," Kobin said. "We 
can't have our cake and eat it too." 
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the impact of the policy on the station's programming will be 
minimal. 
</P>
<P>
"It's harder to fund programs with a potential to be controversial than it is 
to fund programs that are clearly non-controversial," Kobin said. "But that 
doesn't have anything to do with our commitment to developing and trying to 
fund those kinds of programs."

TAPER'S '13TH HOUR' SEEKS TO BUILD BRIDGES; 
</P>
<P>
PERFORMANCE ART: THE THREE-DAY ARRAY OF NEW WORK BY LOCAL ARTISTS IS THE 
THEATER'S FIRST FORAY INTO THE GENRE.

While performance artists such as Karen Finley, Annie Sprinkle and Holly Hughes 
take much of the heat in the controversy surrounding the National Endowment for 
the Arts, the Center Theatre Group/Mark Taper Forum is entering the field with 
its first full evening of performance art. 
</P>
<P>
"The 13th Hour: A Celebration of Performance" features an array of new work by 
local artists working in Western and non-Western forms, at the Taper, Too (John 
Anson Ford Theatre), Thursday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Produced by Taper resident producer Corey Beth Madden and Taper associates 
Robin McKee and Josephine Ramirez, "The 13th Hour" may prove to be a step 
toward what Madden describes as a goal "to enfranchise and connect the 
community of artists in Los Angeles to the Taper." 
</P>
<P>
"We may be the monolith on the hill," she says, "but we can be approached and 
we want to create a dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
"It's important that it build bridges," adds Ramirez. "Particularly for artists 
who are people of color." 
</P>
<P>
On the program will be works by Luis Alfaro, Kamau Daaood, Jan Kaczmarek, the 
team of Dan Kwong and William Roper, and Karen Tei Yamashita. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the Taper New Works festival presented works by three local 
performance artists -- as well as a collaborative work called "The Undead" last 
year -- but this is the first entire bill devoted to such multidisciplinary 
work, and the first time here for these artists. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to create an event alongside of the New Works festival that would 
begin to deal with multidisciplinary arts as they feed into the theater," says 
Madden. 
</P>
<P>
"We were getting a lot of performance artists submitting work to the New Works 
festival. We thought we should be doing something with these artists, meeting 
people we wouldn't ordinarily get to meet and supporting them." 
</P>
<P>
That support, which consists of what Madden calls "presenting rather than 
full-scale producers," is notable for work that strays from the usual Taper 
fare -- an adventurous move at a time when artists in this genre are in the 
middle of the NEA censorship battle. 
</P>
<P>
"The future of the theater is in being able to do more successful collaborating 
between the disciplines," says Madden. "Theater in that sense takes on a 
general term meaning performance, not only plays." 
</P>
<P>
It is also the controversial nature of the performance art that appeals to the 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's raw. It's rough," says McKee. "It tends to deal with issues that are 
close to the bone and close to the heart." 
</P>
<P>
"Because (the artists don't) always put it into verbal and literary channels, 
it can be shocking and incredibly visceral for the audience," she explains. "In 
traditional work you can distance yourself a little more, saying 'that's an 
actor on stage pretending to be somebody else.' " 
</P>
<P>
"It comes out of an alternative tradition," says Ramirez. "When the dominant 
culture likes a certain format, to have another voice saying this is just as 
valid" means there's going to be a reaction. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it's necessarily about content," Ramirez continues. "Because 
the form is so new relative to the theater, what we have is something that is 
constantly changing. Performance art has emerged out of a tradition that's been 
coming along just since the '20s. There's not a party line." 
</P>
<P>
That dynamic quality, says Madden, may be just what theaters such as the Taper 
need. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the concerns in the American resident theater over the past 10 years is 
what's been happening to writers: Are the great voices of American art coming 
out of the theater? Some of them are, but there's also a number of them -- like 
Robert Wilson and Ping Chong -- that are in a category that includes many 
different art forms. 
</P>
<P>
"We're interested in the future of live performance and live performance now 
includes all of those things. 
</P>
<P>
"You can have a deep, abiding interest in the literary aspect of presentation, 
but you can also want and need for your organization to develop interest in the 
whole world of kinetic communication. Whatever title you want to give to live 
performance, the best of it is using as much as possible of the layers of 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
"This has to do with the future of the theater in general," says Madden. "It's 
also the future of this organization in this city. It's our responsibility to 
be open and to be a forum for what goes on in the community."

CHURCH SEEKS INFLUENCE IN SCHOOLS, BUSINESS, SCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS and JOEL SAPPELL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Emerging from years of internal strife and public scandal, the Scientology 
movement has embarked on a sweeping and sophisticated campaign to gain new 
influence in America. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to refurbish the tarnished image of Scientology founder L. Ron 
Hubbard and elevate him to the ranks of history's great humanitarians and 
thinkers. By so doing, the church hopes to broaden the acceptability of 
Hubbard's Scientology teachings and attract millions of new members. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign relies on official church programs and a network of groups run by 
Scientology followers. Here is a sampler of their activities: 
</P>
<P>
Scientologists are disseminating Hubbard's writings in public and private 
school classrooms across the U.S., using groups that seldom publicize their 
Scientology connections. 
</P>
<P>
In the business world, Scientologists have established highly successful 
private consulting firms to promote Hubbard as a management expert, with a goal 
of harvesting new, affluent members. 
</P>
<P>
Scientologists are the driving force behind two organizations active in the 
scientific community. The organizations have been busy trying to sell 
government agencies a chemical detoxification treatment developed by Hubbard. 
</P>
<P>
The Scientology movement's ambitious quest to assimilate into the American 
mainstream comes less than a decade after the church seemed destined for 
collapse, testifying to its remarkable determination to survive and grow. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, 11 top church leaders -- including Hubbard's wife -- were imprisoned 
for bugging and burglarizing government offices as part of a shadowy conspiracy 
to discredit the church's perceived enemies. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Scientology executives insist that the organization is law-abiding, that 
the offenders have been purged and that the church has now entered an era in 
which harmony has replaced hostility. 
</P>
<P>
But as the movement attempts to broaden its reach, evidence is mounting that 
Hubbard's devotees are engaging in practices that, while not unlawful, have 
begun to stir memories of its troubled past. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scientology and the Schools 
</P>
<P>
The Scientology movement has launched a concerted campaign to gain a foothold 
in the nation's schools by distributing to children millions of copies of a 
booklet Hubbard wrote on basic moral values. 
</P>
<P>
The program is designed to win recognition for Hubbard as an educator and 
moralist and, at the same time, introduce him to the nation's youth. 
</P>
<P>
The pocket-size booklet, entitled "The Way to Happiness," is a compilation of 
widely agreed upon values that Hubbard put into writing in 1981. Its 96 pages 
include such admonitions as "take care of yourself," "honor and help your 
parents," "do not murder" and "be worthy of trust." 
</P>
<P>
The booklet notes in small print that it was written by Hubbard as "an 
individual and is not part of any religious doctrine." 
</P>
<P>
But Scientology publications have called the campaign "the largest 
dissemination project in Scientology history" and "the bridge between broad 
society and Scientology." 
</P>
<P>
Scientologists estimate that 3.5 million copies have been introduced into 4,500 
elementary, junior high and senior high schools nationwide. Altogether, more 
than 28 million copies have been translated into at least 14 languages and 
distributed throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
The booklet is distributed by the Concerned Businessmen's Assn. of America, an 
organization not officially connected to the church but run by Scientologists. 
</P>
<P>
The Scientology connection is downplayed by the group. Its leader, Barbara 
Ayash of Marina del Rey, said she launched the association after five of her 
children became involved with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Her group runs a nationwide contest encouraging students to stay off drugs by 
following the precepts in Hubbard's booklet. Participants in the "Set a Good 
Example" contest must come up with projects using the booklet as their guide. 
By focusing on the drug issue, the association has won the backing of school 
officials and political figures unaware of its links to Scientology. 
</P>
<P>
In Louisiana, a junior high school distributed Hubbard's booklet to students 
and then had them pledge in writing: 
</P>
<P>
"I promise to do my best to learn, practice and use the 21 points of good moral 
conduct contained in 'The Way to Happiness' book to improve myself, set a good 
example for my friends, and to help my family, my community and my country." 
</P>
<P>
As an incentive to get campus administrators on board, the association awards 
$5,000 to the winning elementary, junior high and senior high schools. 
</P>
<P>
At contest awards ceremonies, the winners and Hubbard's book share the 
spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
For example, during a ceremony at the Charleston, W.Va., civic center, 
then-Gov. Arch Moore and other dignitaries were each presented a leather-bound 
copy of "The Way To Happiness." 
</P>
<P>
Scientology critics contend that the contest is being used to enlist new church 
members, who, as the theory goes, may be so inspired by "The Way to Happiness" 
that they will reach for Hubbard's other writings. They argue that the 
booklet's distribution in public schools violates constitutional mandates 
separating church and state. 
</P>
<P>
But Ayash of the businessmen's association insists that her group has no motive 
other than to help children lead better lives. "The Way to Happiness," she 
said, shows them the path in simple, direct language. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, school officials whose campuses have participated in the 
contest said they were unaware of Hubbard's Scientology connection or that his 
followers were directing the contest. They said Scientology was not openly 
promoted and they did not regret taking part. 
</P>
<P>
But one California public school system recently banned the contest after 
administrators conducted an investigation and learned that Hubbard was the 
author of Scientology's doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
For three years, students at El Capitan Middle School in Fresno participated in 
the nationwide contest. In Spring, 1989, the students won second place for 
organizing an anti-drug relay in which they passed each other a symbolic 
"torch" -- Hubbard's booklet. 
</P>
<P>
Deluxe leather-bound copies were presented to mayors of the 15 cities along the 
relay route. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, the contest's sponsors decided to accelerate their efforts in Fresno 
County, urging the entire 5,000-student Central Unified School District to 
participate, instead of just one school. But they ran up against Geoff Garratt, 
the district's director of educational services and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Garratt said that, while he was aware of Scientology, he had never heard of 
Hubbard. He said he learned of the connection at the local library, where he 
went to investigate Hubbard's background. 
</P>
<P>
"The more I investigated," Garratt said, "I found it (the businessmen's 
association) represented a very small self-interest group: Scientology." Among 
other things, he said, he discovered that the association had the same phone 
number and address as the local Dianetics center. 
</P>
<P>
Garratt said he rejected the association's plea to expand the contest, fearing 
that the booklet's distribution in the public schools might violate 
constitutional prohibitions against mixing matters of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
Garratt said the association refused to consider the possibility of holding the 
contest without Hubbard's booklet. "They said flat out, 'Without the book, 
there is no contest.' " 
</P>
<P>
Scientologists also are attempting to install a Hubbard tutorial program in 
public schools, using a church-affiliated organization called Applied 
Scholastics. 
</P>
<P>
Yellow posters advertising Applied Scholastics have appeared in storefront 
windows throughout Los Angeles. They promise better learning skills but make no 
mention of the church. 
</P>
<P>
Applied Scholastics currently has plans to build a 1,000-acre campus, where the 
organization would train educators to teach Hubbard's tutorial program. A 
recent Applied Scholastics mailer predicted that the training center will be a 
"model of real education for the world" and "create overwhelming public 
popularity" for Hubbard. 
</P>
<P>
Developed for students of Scientology, the Hubbard program is built upon an 
elementary premise: learning difficulties arise when students read past words 
they do not understand. 
</P>
<P>
"The misunderstood word in a subject produces a vast panorama of mental effects 
and is the prime factor involved in stupidity," Hubbard wrote in 1967. "This is 
a sweepingly fantastic discovery in the field of education." 
</P>
<P>
The chief solution he propounds is simple: students must learn to use a 
dictionary when they encounter an unfamiliar or confusing word. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Applied Scholastics has targeted predominantly minority 
schools, where many students tend to do poorly on standardized tests. Applied 
Scholastics considers these schools fertile ground because campus 
administrators are willing to try new approaches to improve scores. 
</P>
<P>
The Compton Unified School District in 1987 and 1988 allowed the Hubbard 
program to be tested with 80 students at Centennial Senior High School. The 
program there was run by a substitute teacher named Frizell Clegg, a 
Scientologist who was an Applied Scholastics consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Clegg, who refused to be interviewed, was suspended from his teaching duties in 
1988 after he reportedly gave discourses on Scientology in a history class. He 
no longer teaches at the school. 
</P>
<P>
In applying for district financing, Clegg said the educational program was 
"developed by American writer and educator L. Ron Hubbard." Excluding any 
reference to Hubbard's Scientology connection, he persuaded the board to 
provide $5,000 to tutor 30 sophomores with low reading scores and to conduct a 
parent workshop. 
</P>
<P>
After the program grew to 50 students, Applied Scholastics submitted a proposal 
increasing the number of students to 125 and the cost to $27,000. 
</P>
<P>
District officials killed the program, believing that Applied Scholastics was 
seeking to expand too quickly. Officials were also displeased that the group, 
without district approval, was using its involvement with Centennial to market 
the program elsewhere, according to Acting Supt. Elisa Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
In promotional literature, Applied Scholastics made claims of remarkable 
success at Centennial High. While some parents said the program helped their 
children, Sanchez said the claims made by Applied Scholastics were 
unsubstantiated. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Converting the Business World 
</P>
<P>
Scientology is using a network of private consulting firms to gain a foothold 
in the U.S. business community. 
</P>
<P>
The firms promise businessmen higher earnings but appear to be mainly 
interested in recruiting new members for the church. 
</P>
<P>
Although these profit-making firms operate independently of each other, they 
sell the same product: Scientology founder Hubbard's methods for running a 
profitable enterprise. The Church of Scientology has for years employed these 
same methods -- heavy marketing, high productivity and rigid rules of employee 
conduct -- to amass hundreds of millions of dollars for itself. 
</P>
<P>
Critics contend that the consulting firms are concealing their Scientology 
links so they can attract to the church prosperous people who might otherwise 
be put off by Scientology's controversial reputation. 
</P>
<P>
The strategy appears to have proven effective. 
</P>
<P>
A Scientology publication in 1987 reported that the consultant network earned a 
combined $1.6 million a month selling Hubbard's management methods to a variety 
of professionals, many of whom have reported improved incomes. It also said 
that 50 to 75 businessmen were recruited monthly into the church, where each 
week they spent a total of $250,000 on Scientology courses. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the movement's firms have been ranked by Inc. magazine as among the 
fastest growing private businesses in America. 
</P>
<P>
The consulting firms use seminars and mailers to attract health professionals, 
salesmen, office supply dealers, marketing specialists and others. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have dealt with the firms describe the process this way: 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen are drawn into Scientology after they have gained confidence in 
Hubbard's non-religious management methods. They are often told that, to 
achieve true business success, they should get their personal lives in order. 
From there, the church takes over, encouraging them to purchase spiritual 
enhancement courses and begin a process called "auditing." 
</P>
<P>
During auditing, a person confesses his innermost thoughts while his responses 
are monitored on a lie detector-type device known as the E-meter. Auditing must 
be purchased in 12 1/2-hour chunks, costing between $3,000 and $11,000 each, 
depending on where it is bought. 
</P>
<P>
Spearheading all this is an arm of the church called World Institute of 
Scientology Enterprises, or WISE. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, WISE has been encouraging Scientologists nationwide to become 
consultants within their respective professions. The appeal is simple: make 
money while disseminating your religion. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, WISE profits, too. It trains and licenses the firms to sell 
Hubbard's copyrighted "management and administrative technology." WISE charges 
roughly $12,000 for its basic no-frills training course. For consulting 
services, it charges $1,875 a day. 
</P>
<P>
On top of this, the consulting firms that sell Hubbard's business methods must 
pay WISE 13% of their annual gross income. 
</P>
<P>
At the heart of Hubbard's business system is a concept he called "management by 
statistics," which he said guarantees optimum office efficiency. Scientology 
critics maintain, however, that it creates an oppressive and regimented 
workplace environment. 
</P>
<P>
An employee is judged solely upon his productivity, which is charted on a graph 
each week. Sagging productivity could bring a rebuke from the boss. Or it could 
lead to an employee's firing. 
</P>
<P>
The management techniques promoted by the consulting firms are identical to 
those used by the church, except that all Scientology references have been 
deleted from the materials. The consultants even employ the most basic 
instrument used by the church to recruit new members off the street -- a 
200-question personality test that purports to let people know if they have 
ruinous personality flaws. 
</P>
<P>
The consultants encourage businessmen and their employees to purchase 
Scientology courses to remedy personality problems uncovered by the test. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most successful consulting firms licensed by WISE is Sterling 
Management Systems, which targets dentists and other health care professionals. 
For the past two years, Inc. magazine has ranked it among America's 
fastest-growing privately held businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling, based in Glendale, claims to be the "largest health care management 
consulting group in the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said the firm charges clients $10,000 for its complete line 
of Hubbard courses and 30 hours of private consultation. The spokesman said 
Sterling has helped dentists increase their income an average of $10,000 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the company has "no connection" to the church, but added: "If 
people are interested in Scientology, we will make it available to them." 
</P>
<P>
Sterling publishes a tabloid called "Today's Professional, the Journal of 
Successful Practice Management." Mailed free to 300,000 health care 
professionals nationwide, it is filled with "management" articles by Hubbard 
that are actually excerpts from Scientology's governing doctrines. 
</P>
<P>
The company also holds nationwide seminars that, according to its promotional 
literature, have been drawing 2,000 people a month. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling Management was founded in 1983 by Scientologist Gregory K. Hughes, at 
the time a prosperous dentist in Vacaville, Calif. Hughes holds seminars across 
the country, offering himself as evidence that Hubbard's methods work. 
</P>
<P>
In promotional publications for Sterling, Hughes has said that his annual 
income soared from $257,000 in 1979 to more than $1 million in 1985. In one 
month alone, he has claimed to have seen 350 new patients. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling's paper, Today's Professional, has boasted that "the techniques that 
produced amazing results when applied to Greg's practice are being applied all 
over the U.S." 
</P>
<P>
But neither the paper's readers nor those who attend Hughes' seminars are told 
that his dental office, which employed the high-volume Hubbard techniques that 
he imparts to others, has been accused by former patients of dental negligence 
and malpractice. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes currently is under investigation by the California Board of Dental 
Examiners. The board already has turned over some of its findings to the state 
attorney general's office, which will determine whether action should be taken 
against Hughes' dental license. 
</P>
<P>
To date, there are more than 15 lawsuits pending against Hughes and his dental 
associates, alleging either negligence or malpractice. He has denied the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney E. Bradley Nelson is representing most of those who have sued Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my opinion," he said, "that the overall quality of care took second 
place to the profit motive. . . . I've never seen anything approaching this 
volume of complaints against one dentist in such a short period of time." 
</P>
<P>
In mid-1985, Hughes closed his office without warning to devote full time to 
Sterling. He left behind a reputation so tarnished that he was unable to sell 
his million-dollar-a-year practice, according to dentists in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"He actually had to walk away," said Roger Abrew, co-chairman of the peer 
review committee of local dental society. 
</P>
<P>
He also left behind patients with worse problems than they had before they were 
treated by Hughes' office, according to Abrew and other dentists, who have 
since been treating them. The dentists said that, based on their examinations, 
Hughes' office performed both substandard and unnecessary work. 
</P>
<P>
"I think its kind of ironic to see a guy who did such a botched job of 
dentistry teaching others," said dentist David C. Aronson, summing up the 
sentiments of most of his colleagues in the small Northern California 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, who continues to conduct his "Winning With Dentistry" seminars, refused 
to be interviewed for this story. But Frederick Bradley, an attorney defending 
him in the lawsuits, suggested that the Vacaville dentists may simply resent 
his client's success because their patients had deserted them for Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
Another firm once licensed by Scientology's WISE organization to sell Hubbard's 
management techniques was Singer Consultants. Before it merged with another 
management company, Singer was ranked as one of the nation's fastest growing 
private businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The company focused its training on America's chiropractors. It brought 
hundreds of new members into the church and triggered a nationwide controversy 
among chiropractors over its links to Scientology. In fact, a chiropractic 
newspaper devoted almost an entire issue to letters praising and condemning 
Singer Consultants, which was located in Clearwater, Fla., where Scientology is 
a major presence. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that there were young doctors who didn't know they were being 
solicited to do something above and beyond the practice of their profession," 
said Dynamic Chiropractic editor Donald M. Peterson, explaining why his 
Huntington Beach-based newspaper entered the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Singer Consultants was headed by Scientologist David Singer, an accomplished 
speaker and chiropractor who held nationwide seminars to pitch Hubbard's 
business methods. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the company was absorbed into another management firm owned by 
Scientologists. 
</P>
<P>
Although Singer refused to be interviewed by The Times, he told Dynamic 
Chiropractic: "Hubbard was a prolific writer and wrote on a multitude of 
subjects. We do not, have not and will not make part of our program the 
teaching of any religion." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scientology and Science 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard was so proud of a detoxification treatment he developed -- and so 
hungry for plaudits -- that he openly talked with his closest aides about 
winning a Nobel Prize. 
</P>
<P>
Although the man is gone, Scientologists are keeping the dream alive. They have 
embarked upon a controversial plan to win recognition for Hubbard and his 
treatment program in scientific and medical circles. 
</P>
<P>
The treatment purports to purge drugs and toxins from a person's system through 
a rigorous regimen of exercise, saunas and vitamins -- a combination intended 
to dislodge the poisons from fatty tissues and sweat them out. 
</P>
<P>
Physicians affiliated with the regimen have touted it as a major breakthrough, 
and a number of patients who have undergone the treatment say their health 
improved. But some health authorities dismiss Hubbard's program as a medical 
fraud that preys upon public fear of toxins. 
</P>
<P>
In the Church of Scientology, the treatment is called the "purification 
rundown." Church members are told it is a religious program that, for about 
$2,000, will purify the body and spirit. In the secular arena, however, 
Scientologists are promoting it exclusively as a medical treatment with no 
spiritual underpinnings. In that context, it is simply called the "Hubbard 
Method." 
</P>
<P>
The treatment is being aggressively pushed in the non-Scientology world by two 
organizations that sometimes work alone and sometimes in tandem. They have no 
formal church ties but both are controlled by church members. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking customers and credibility, the two groups have targeted government and 
private workers nationwide who are exposed to hazardous substances in their 
jobs. They have pressed public agencies to endorse the method, lobbied unions 
to recommend it and written articles in trade journals that seem to be little 
more than advertisements for the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
One of these groups is the Los Angeles-based Foundation for Advancements in 
Science and Education. The nonprofit foundation has forged links with 
scientists across the country to gain legitimacy for itself and, thus, for 
Hubbard's detox method. 
</P>
<P>
Among its key functionaries is a toxicologist for the Environmental Protection 
Agency, whose advocacy of the treatment has raised conflict-of-interest 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
Building credentials and allies, the foundation has channeled tens of thousands 
of dollars in grants to educators and researchers studying toxicological 
hazards, most of whom were unaware of the organization's ties to the 
Scientology movement. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, for example, the foundation gave $10,000 to the Los Angeles County 
Health Department for a study of potentially harmful radon gas. County 
officials say they were not apprised of the organization's links with the 
Scientology movement. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Franks was instrumental in creating the foundation in 1981 when he served 
as the Church of Scientology's executive director, a post from which he was 
later ousted in a power struggle. Franks described the foundation in an 
interview as a Scientology "front group." 
</P>
<P>
"The concept," he said, "was to get some scientific recognition" for Hubbard's 
treatment without overtly linking it to the church. 
</P>
<P>
Buttressing Franks' account, the foundation's original incorporation papers 
state that its purpose was to "research the efficacy of and promote the use of 
the works of L. Ron Hubbard in the solving of social problems; and to 
scientifically research and provide public information and education concerning 
the efficacy of other programs." 
</P>
<P>
The document was later amended, however, to remove Hubbard's name, obscuring 
the foundation's ties to the Scientology movement and its founder in official 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard's name, however, continues to appear regularly in the foundation's 
slick newsletter. In the latest edition, for instance, three different articles 
advocate the "Hubbard method" as an effective therapy for chemical and drug 
detoxification. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth article did not mention Hubbard by name, but reported favorably on 
Narconon, his drug and alcohol rehabilitation program, which is run by 
Scientologists. 
</P>
<P>
The other organization in the outreach effort is HealthMed Clinic, which 
administers Hubbard's treatment from offices in Los Angeles and Sacramento and 
is run by Scientologists. 
</P>
<P>
An independent medical consultant in Maryland who reviewed the program for the 
city of Shreveport, La., dismissed Hubbard's treatment as "quackery." 
</P>
<P>
The foundation and HealthMed have attempted to create an impression that they 
are linked only by a shared concern over toxic hazards. In reality, however, 
they operate symbiotically. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation, for its part, tries to scientifically validate the Hubbard 
method through studies and articles by individuals who either are 
Scientologists or hold foundation positions. HealthMed then uses the 
foundation's credibility, writings and connections to get customers for the 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
According to state corporate records, the foundation also holds stock in 
HealthMed. Moreover, the foundation's vice president, Scientologist Jack 
Dirmann, has served as HealthMed's administrator. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, four doctors with the California Department of Health Services accused 
HealthMed of making "false medical claims" and of "taking advantage of the 
fears of workers and the public and about toxic chemicals and their potential 
health effects, including cancer." The doctors also criticized the foundation 
for supporting "scientifically questionable" research. 
</P>
<P>
The state physicians, who evaluate potential toxic hazards in the workplace, 
leveled the accusations in a letter that triggered an investigation by the 
state Board of Medical Quality Assurance. That probe was concluded last year 
without a finding of whether the detox treatment works. Investigators said they 
were stymied by HealthMed's refusal to provide patient records and by a lack of 
complaints from those who had undergone the regimen. 
</P>
<P>
The four physicians who prompted the investigation said they decided to study 
the Hubbard treatment after receiving calls from union representatives, public 
agencies and individual workers throughout the state who had been solicited by 
the clinics. Among them were the California Highway Patrol, the International 
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. and the Los 
Angeles County Fire and Sheriff's departments. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the accumulation of these calls that led us to say, 'Hey, this is going 
on all over the state. Let's look into it,' " recalled Gideon Letz, one of the 
doctors. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation and HealthMed have worked particularly hard to tap one large 
pool of potential clients: firefighters. The Hubbard method has been pitched to 
them as a cure for exposure to a carcinogen sometimes encountered during fires. 
Known as PCBs, the now-banned chemical compound was once widely used to 
insulate transformers. 
</P>
<P>
City officials in Shreveport, La., said they paid HealthMed $80,000 -- and were 
ready to spend a lot more -- until they hired a consultant, who denounced the 
treatments as unnecessary and worthless. 
</P>
<P>
What happened in Shreveport is a case study of how the foundation and HealthMed 
have worked together to draw customers through methods that critics contend are 
exploitative. 
</P>
<P>
In April, 1987, dozens of Shreveport firemen were exposed to PCBs when they 
responded to an early morning transformer explosion at the Louisiana State 
University Medical Center. In the aftermath, some began to complain of 
headaches, dizziness, skin rashes, memory loss and other symptoms that they 
attributed to the exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Blood and tissue tests by the university medical center showed no abnormal 
levels of PCBs in their systems. But the firemen wondered if the university was 
trying to protect itself from liability because the explosion had occured 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Searching for alternatives, one of the firemen came across an article in Fire 
Engineering magazine. Headlined "Chemical Exposure in Firefighting: The Enemy 
Within," it was written by Gerald T. Lionelli, "senior research associate for 
the Foundation for Advancements in Science and Education." 
</P>
<P>
Lionelli discussed the frightening consequences of chemical exposure and then 
got to the point. He said the foundation had found an effective detoxification 
technique developed by "the late American researcher L. Ron Hubbard" and 
delivered by HealthMed Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
The article did not mention another of Hubbard's notable developments -- 
Scientology. 
</P>
<P>
The firemen contacted HealthMed, and, before long, were sold on the program. 
They went next to Howard Foggin, then the city's medical claims officer, and 
gave him HealthMed literature and a Washington, D.C., phone number the clinic 
had provided them. It was for the office of EPA toxicologist William Marcus. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus, a non-Scientologist, is a senior adviser to the foundation. But it is 
his authoritative position with the EPA's office of drinking water that helps 
impress potential HealthMed clients. 
</P>
<P>
When Shreveport officials called Marcus, he vouched for HealthMed. The EPA had 
spoken, or so the city's claims manager thought back then. 
</P>
<P>
"All he told me was, it seemed I had no alternative but to send those people to 
Los Angeles" for HealthMed's treatment, Foggin said, adding: "I felt I had to 
get moving on it fast." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times, Marcus acknowledged that he recommended 
HealthMed, but he denied any conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
"They called me and I talked to them," Marcus said. "I told them that basically 
there was no other game in town. . . . I think L. Ron Hubbard is a bona fide 
genius." 
</P>
<P>
Marcus said he receives only travel-related expenses for the foundation work. 
</P>
<P>
His boss, Michael Cook, said he is satisfied that Marcus did not act 
improperly. He said that Marcus has insisted "he made it clear that he was not 
speaking as an EPA employee. Certainly that is what we would hope and expect he 
(would) do." 
</P>
<P>
In all, HealthMed brought about 20 Shreveport firefighters to Los Angeles to 
treat what the clinic described as high levels of PCBs in their blood and fatty 
tissues. For the most part, the firemen returned home saying that they felt 
better. 
</P>
<P>
Although city officials had learned of Hubbard's Scientology connection, they 
were unconcerned. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as HealthMed's bills mounted, two private insurance carriers for 
Shreveport suggested that city officials hire an independent analyst to review 
the treatment before doling out more money. The city agreed and commissioned a 
study by National Medical Advisory Service Inc., of Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by Dr. Ronald E. Gots, was an indictment of HealthMed's 
professionalism and ethics. The bottom line: 
</P>
<P>
"The treatment in California preyed upon the fears of concerned workers, but 
served no rational medical function. . . . Moreover, the program itself, 
developed not by physicians or scientists, but by the founder of the Church of 
Scientology, has no recognized value in the established medical and scientific 
community. It is quackery." 
</P>
<P>
Gots' 1987 report ended the city's involvement with HealthMed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we were misled," lamented city finance director Jim Keyes. "Somebody 
should have laid everything out on the table." 
</P>
<P>
Neither HealthMed nor the foundation would return phone calls from The Times.

BUSH ABANDONS VOW, BACKS A TAX INCREASE;

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, formally abandoning the central pledge of his 1988 presidential 
campaign, declared Tuesday that preserving a healthy economy will require new 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear to me that both the size of the deficit problem and the need for a 
package that can be enacted require" a series of measures including "tax 
revenue increases" as well as spending cuts, Bush said in a written statement 
issued after a breakfast meeting with congressional leaders of both parties. 
</P>
<P>
He specifically mentioned the possibility of trimming "entitlement and 
mandatory" spending programs, a reference to Social Security, Medicare, 
Medicaid and other benefit programs. He did not specify the type of tax 
increase he had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
With his statement, Bush abandoned his campaign pledge -- "Read my lips, no new 
taxes" -- and opened the door to a "grand compromise" with Congress that could 
narrow or even close the federal deficit. Richard G. Darman, Bush's budget 
director, has been advocating such a compromise almost since the day Bush took 
office. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, Bush may have sparked a full-scale revolt among 
conservatives in his party, many of whom believe that higher taxes are far 
worse for the country than continued deficits. He may also have given up what 
many Republican strategists see as the party's most important issue -- low 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders, by contrast, welcomed Bush's new stance, which was 
prepared, word by word, during the breakfast meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Administration and congressional negotiators, who have been meeting since May 9 
to try to craft a deficit-reduction package acceptable to all parties, have 
discussed a host of potential tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
Some proposals, such as increased "user fees" and hikes in tobacco and alcohol 
taxes, might be relatively easy for Bush to embrace. The Administration has 
already proposed roughly $20 billion in new user fees and other minor revenue 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday's statement was made necessary because Democratic leaders said that 
package was unacceptable. And while White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said 
it was up to the negotiators to decide what to do next, he pointedly refused to 
rule out broader tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans, however, may find it difficult to accept Democratic demands to 
increase income taxes for the wealthiest Americans. "I can't see Democrats 
agreeing unless there are (income tax) rate changes that insure that (the final 
package) is not unfair to the poor and middle class," said House Ways and Means 
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.). 
</P>
<P>
Budget negotiators hope to work out a final package before Congress leaves 
Washington for its August recess. 
</P>
<P>
Before Tuesday's developments, said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser 
(D-Tenn.), the budget talks "were stalemated, going nowhere. The President 
broke an impasse." 
</P>
<P>
Bush himself told reporters at the White House Rose Garden Tuesday afternoon: 
"It is essential that these talks get moving and get moving faster. I want to 
see this economy grow. I want jobs. I want to see the deficit down." 
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders had insisted when the talks began that they would not get 
involved in specific negotiations unless Bush publicly admitted that a tax 
increase would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, the White House insisted that all issues were "on the table" and 
that Bush would impose "no preconditions" on the talks. But Democrats had 
insisted on a more explicit statement. 
</P>
<P>
After Bush gave them what they had sought, Democratic leaders appeared solemn 
and reserved as they struggled to avoid seeming to take political advantage of 
Bush's retreat. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope this is not going to be the subject of a political campaign effort," 
said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) "Someone who wants to complain 
about taxes being raised will have to complain against both parties." 
</P>
<P>
When the negotiations began, Democrats feared that Republicans would maneuver 
them into a corner -- forcing them to call for a tax increase and then 
campaigning against them as "tax-and-spend" liberals. 
</P>
<P>
Many Republican candidates for the Senate this fall already have been doing 
just that, much as Bush had done in 1988. In that year, Bush's favorite line -- 
"Read my lips, no new taxes" -- formed the centerpiece of his standard stump 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's statement not only abandoned that pledge but also gave up on a 
central tenet of the Republican political philosophy for the past decade -- 
that the deficit is caused by too much spending, not by too little revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater, explaining Bush's decision, said that closing the deficit without 
new taxes would require spending cuts so large that they "would be unacceptable 
to all parties." 
</P>
<P>
The White House estimates that the federal deficit will be roughly $160 billion 
in fiscal 1991, which begins on Oct. 1. The Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law 
would require about $100 billion in across-the-board spending cuts unless the 
President and Congress agree on a new budget plan. 
</P>
<P>
To mollify conservatives, Bush aides spent much of the day circulating word 
that the White House was not agreeing to anything beyond the approximately $20 
billion in new user fees and related taxes that Bush has already advocated. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not changing my mind at all" on taxes, Bush insisted during a 45-minute 
session with 15 Latino reporters from around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Vice President Dan Quayle echoed the theme. "It should not be viewed as a 
change of policy," he said in an interview in Los Angeles, where he was raising 
money for GOP candidates. "This is a deficit reduction summit, not a tax 
increase summit." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would now admit that Bush was breaking his campaign pledge against 
new taxes, Fitzwater responded with a laugh: "Are you crazy? . . . Everything 
we said was true then, and it's true now. We feel he said the right thing then; 
he's saying the right thing now." 
</P>
<P>
Democratic leaders reacted with some anger to the White House damage control 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"The President's statement is clear and unambiguous," said Senate Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.). "He said that it is clear to him that tax 
increases are required. This is a new statement by the President. Any attempt 
by White House officials or other Republicans to describe the statement 
otherwise are totally inconsistent with what occurred today." 
</P>
<P>
Even Fitzwater conceded as much as he listed a series of factors that had 
forced Bush to change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
The most important was the weakening of the economy since Bush took office. 
Fitzwater noted that economic statistics continue to show interest rates higher 
and growth rates lower than the White House had hoped. Bush advisers and most 
Democratic economists hold deficits at least partly responsible, a point 
conservatives dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the mounting cost of the savings and loan bailout has swelled the 
deficit, Fitzwater said. 
</P>
<P>
Not all members of Bush's party, however, were willing to abandon their belief 
that new taxes are worse than continued deficits. 
</P>
<P>
"Any tax rate increase now threatens recession," Rep. C. Christopher Cox 
(R-Newport Beach) said in a statement. "Just the prospect of a tax increase is 
like a dagger pointed at the jugular vein of the American economy." 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of Bush's statement, 90 Republican members of Congress signed a 
letter to Bush declaring "we were stunned by your announcement that you would 
be willing to accept tax revenue increases as a part of a budget summit 
package." 
</P>
<P>
"A tax increase is unacceptable," the GOP congressmen wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writers George Ramos in Washington and Cathleen Decker in Los 
Angeles contributed to this story.

<P>
Invoking the names of American heroes and language from the Declaration of 
Independence, a tough-talking Nelson Mandela drew a rousing reception Tuesday 
as he became the first black private citizen to address a joint session of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people demand democracy," Mandela said during a 33-minute speech, by far 
the longest and most eloquent yet on his 12-day, eight-city U.S. tour. 
"Unhappily, our people continue to die to this day, victims of the armed agents 
of the state." 
</P>
<P>
The South African people, he said, "thirst" for the day when the government 
will not turn its guns against them for asserting that "equality, liberty and 
the pursuit of happiness are fundamental human rights which are not only 
inalienable but must, if necessary, be defended with the weapons of war." 
</P>
<P>
Striking an uncharacteristically personal note, Mandela, who was released in 
February after 27 years in prison, said: 
</P>
<P>
"We went to jail because it was impossible to sit still while the obscenity of 
the apartheid system was being imposed on our people. It would have been 
immoral to keep quiet while a racist tyranny sought to reduce an entire people 
into a status worse than that of the beasts of the forest." 
</P>
<P>
Standing ramrod straight in the Speaker's well, the tall, slender Mandela was 
interrupted by applause more than 15 times, including several standing ovations 
that visibly elated members of his delegation. Also in the audience were 
members of President Bush's Cabinet, Washington's diplomatic corps and the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff led by its chairman, Gen. Colin L. Powell. 
</P>
<P>
After his address, it took Mandela more than five minutes to work his way 
through a crush of cheering, whistling, back-slapping well-wishers as he exited 
the packed House chamber. 
</P>
<P>
"Marvelous," Wyoming Sen. Alan K. Simpson, the Republican whip, told Mandela as 
they shook hands. 
</P>
<P>
Not once during his appearance did Mandela raise a fist, as he has at virtually 
every stop since he landed in New York last Wednesday morning. Instead, he 
simply smiled and waved repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, the deputy president of the African National Congress met 
with Senate and House leaders and members of the Senate Foreign Relations and 
the House Foreign Affairs committees. 
</P>
<P>
After a scheduled dinner with members of the ANC in the Washington area, 
Mandela attended an evening rally at the Washington Convention Center, which 
sold out all 19,000 tickets within hours last week. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela began a busy Tuesday on Capitol Hill with a breakfast hosted by the 
Congressional Black Caucus that also was attended by spouses and selected 
guests, including Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, Texas Democratic 
gubernatorial candidate Ann Richards, Baltimore Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke and 
singer Harry Belafonte. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very rare that people of different political affiliations should be so 
united in supporting a cause," Mandela told them. "As far as we are concerned, 
it is very difficult to draw a distinction between Democrats and Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
But some members of Congress stayed away from Mandela's subsequent speech, 
including Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), who had fought vigorously but 
unsuccessfully against the imposition of sanctions against Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
Another was Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), who had been on the House 
floor until shortly before Mandela's arrival. He said that he boycotted "as a 
matter of principle" and said Mandela is more like the 1960s revolutionary H. 
Rap Brown than Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
But that was a decidedly minority viewpoint on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
"To be there, to see him, to have him thank members of the Congressional Black 
Caucus, makes my lifetime in politics worthwhile," said Rep. Charles B. Rangel 
(D-N.Y.), who represents Harlem, where Mandela got a tumultuous greeting last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a punishing itinerary, Mandela's tour organizers at the last minute 
added to his schedule a Tuesday noon rally on Pennsylvania Avenue. But 
Mandela's motorcade, going from the Capitol to his downtown hotel, did not stop 
at Freedom Plaza, where several hundred disappointed people had gathered in 
front of Washington's City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela and his 13-member delegation are to depart this morning for Atlanta, 
with subsequent stops in Miami, Detroit and -- on Friday -- Los Angeles. 
Mandela is to leave the United States from Oakland on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
As an eleventh-hour addition to his Los Angeles visit, a private meeting has 
been scheduled between Mandela and former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky, who 
was jailed for 8 1/2 years before he was allowed to emigrate to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, 71, still has stops in England, Ireland and various cities in Africa 
before returning to Soweto in mid-July, according to one Mandela adviser, 
Zwelahke Sisulu. 
</P>
<P>
In addressing Congress, Mandela was virtually guaranteed a largely friendly 
audience. Four years ago. Congress overrode President Ronald Reagan's veto and 
imposed economic sanctions, including trade and travel restrictions, against 
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Mandela urged Congress to let the South African people decide when 
the sanctions should be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose for which they were imposed has not yet been achieved," he said. 
"We have yet to arrive at the point when we can say that South Africa is set on 
an irreversible course leading to its transformation into a united, democratic 
and non-racial country." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela brought the packed House chamber and guest gallery to its feet by 
saying that black South Africans who are familiar with the works of George 
Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, Frederick Douglass and King will 
fight for freedom, just as those American heroes did. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela thanked Congress for helping enable many black South Africans "to 
emerge from the darkness of the prison cell and join the contemporary process 
of the renewal of the world." With continued American moral and economic 
support, South Africa will become "an oasis of good race relations," Mandela 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It must surely be that there will be born a country on the southern tip of 
Africa which you will be proud to call a friend and an ally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Let that day come now. Let us keep our arms locked together so that we form a 
solid phalanx against racism to ensure that that day comes now. Peace will not 
come to our country and region until the apartheid system is ended."

NICHOLS QUITS UNDER FIRE AS HEAD OF DWP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After weeks of battling with Mayor Tom Bradley, Department of Water and Power 
General Manager Norm Nichols voluntarily resigned Tuesday, saying the giant 
city-owned utility was becoming a "political playpen." 
</P>
<P>
"We know of too many instances where politically motivated agendas have 
replaced sound business judgment," Nichols said in his letter of resignation to 
the DWP Board of Commissioners. "I cannot manage this business wherein 
political considerations are paramount to prudent management decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Nichols, 55, said in an interview with The Times that he felt political 
pressure from Bradley's staff in recent months and particularly since April, 
when he initially opposed Bradley's plan to implement mandatory water 
rationing. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is scheduled to vote today on the mayor's proposal requiring 
water customers to reduce their consumption by 10% or pay fines. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols said he quit because he felt the agency was under siege. "I saw that it 
was going to be an issue-of-the-week scenario," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Nichols was publicly criticized by Bradley and City 
Controller Rick Tuttle for what they said were excessive spending for charter 
jets and DWP tours. 
</P>
<P>
"The employees of this department . . . do not deserve to suffer the 
distraction and publicity associated with the continuing effort by the mayor 
and the controller to use the department for their own personal 
aggrandizement," Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said Nichols' statements "clearly indicate that he is out of step with 
the people of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The people demand that our environment be protected and that public money be 
spent efficiently," he said. "Mr. Nichols apparently failed to recognize these 
fundamental facts of Los Angeles life." 
</P>
<P>
Said Tuttle: "Mr. Nichols blames me in part for his difficulties. In fact, Mr. 
Nichols has been the architect of his problems. He was unwilling to change his 
practice of traveling on charter flights at an exorbitant cost to DWP 
rate-payers." 
</P>
<P>
City Council members and DWP commissioners were split in their reaction to the 
sudden announcement. Nichols, recognized as an effective manager and strategic 
planner, also was seen by city officials as aloof, arrogant and unwilling to 
bend to political considerations. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky immediately called for a full council hearing 
on Nichols' allegations of political intrusion at the department. "Mr. Nichols 
made some serious allegations in his letter of resignation," Yaroslavsky said. 
"The council feels that he owes it to the City Council and to the people of Los 
Angeles to tell us more specifically what he is referring to." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said it was not enough that Nichols ran "the best public utility in the 
nation." He said Nichols also had to understand that the mayor "is elected as 
administrator of all city government." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley acknowledged that he had no differences with Nichols until April, when 
the general manager initially balked at endorsing the mayor's rationing plan. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley and Nichols agreed that he was not asked to leave the post that pays 
$151,359 annually, second only to the manager of the Department of Airports in 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
Nichols, who was appointed general manager by the DWP commissioners in 1988, 
said his decision to leave after 33 years was not a "knee-jerk reaction" to 
Bradley's tongue-lashings about expenses. 
</P>
<P>
His decision, he said, was one of great personal anguish that simmered for 
months. And Nichols said he hoped his exit would refocus attention on the need 
to keep the DWP independent of political interference. 
</P>
<P>
"I would hope customers would ask, 'Hey, where's this going to take us?' " 
Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
The DWP, with more than 11,000 employees and an annual budget of nearly $3 
billion, is the nation's largest municipal utility. It provides water and 
electrical power for more than 3 million city residents and contributes more 
than $100 million a year to the city's general funds. In California, only 
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co. are larger 
than the DWP. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley made it clear that he plans an aggressive environmentalist agenda for 
the DWP and that Nichols was slow to get on board. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor is expected to soon name Mary Nichols (no relation to Norm Nichols), 
an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council and a former Bradley 
campaign manager, to replace commissioner Carol Wheeler, who resigned Monday at 
Bradley's request. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Bradley appointed Mike Gage, an environmentalist and his 
former aide, and Dorothy Green, of Heal the Bay, a watchdog group that monitors 
Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
This "loading up of the board" with environmentalists, as Norm Nichols put it, 
was among the reasons he cited for stepping down. Nichols urged the DWP 
commissioners to "advise the City Council to . . . to ensure that balanced and 
reasoned viewpoints can be heard" on the DWP board. 
</P>
<P>
Although Nichols was under fire for allowing $700,000 in chartered private jets 
and a $1-million VIP tour program, his resignation was a surprise to his staff, 
the mayor's office and the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction from commissioners and City Council members to Nichols' announcement 
was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Upon being told of the resignation, DWP Commissioner Gage said, "So be it. Some 
people don't adapt to change very well." 
</P>
<P>
But commission President Rick Caruso lauded Nichols as a brilliant manager and 
said, "It's unfortunate to lose someone with his talent." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Ernani Bernardi called him a "political scapegoat. . . . 
Apparently, the mayor's getting mostly political advice now, and the 
environment is a hot ticket." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores agreed that Nichols may have been mistreated by 
the mayor. "I'm not sure the mayor ever sat down with Nichols and said, 'We've 
got some differences.' (Bradley) just called press conferences instead. That 
must be demoralizing." 
</P>
<P>
Said Councilman Michael Woo: "What Mr. Nichols is calling political pressure we 
call accountability." Woo said the council and mayor are trying to respond to 
public concerns about the environment. "Norm Nichols is the first casualty of 
that battle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Richard Alatorre said he was disturbed by the turn of events. 
"This should serve as a warning that we need to allow general managers to do 
their job," he said. "I think we lost a good general manager." 
</P>
<P>
Walter Zelman, a former DWP commissioner and former director of the political 
watchdog group Common Cause, said, "I think the recent assertion of City Hall 
political needs and agendas into department activities has been excessively 
heavy-handed and not in the long-term best interests of the department or of 
the city." 
</P>
<P>
Nichols immediately will be replaced on an interim basis by Assistant General 
Manger Dan Waters, DWP officials said. Bradley promised that a nationwide 
search would be launched immediately for a successor. 
</P>
<P>
But commission President Caruso said he "will strongly resist any effort to go 
outside" the department to find a new general manager because there is adequate 
management talent within the DWP.

AMA URGES ACTION ON SEVERE POLLUTION ALONG U.S.-MEXICAN BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pollution is so severe and infectious disease so rampant along the U.S.-Mexico 
border that a binational commission must be created to solve the problems, an 
American Medical Assn. report said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Current solutions are inadequate, fragmentary and not coordinated by the two 
nations," said the report, published Tuesday in the Journal of the American 
Medical Assn. The full AMA approved a committee recommendation to create such a 
commission last summer, but the report was not published until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Conditions are so squalid, the AMA said, that they seriously affect health and 
economics on both sides of the border. Specifically: 
</P>
<P>
About 12 million gallons of raw sewage flow daily into the Tijuana River before 
it empties into the Pacific Ocean off San Diego County. Another 20 million and 
22 million gallons, respectively, are dumped into the New River at Mexicali and 
the Rio Grande in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
The fecal count at some points in the Rio Grande is a dangerous 22,000 bacteria 
per milliliter. 
</P>
<P>
Hepatitis is especially high among people who live along the border. About 35% 
of children under 8 in San Elizario, Tex., near El Paso, have had hepatitis A, 
and 85% to 90% of residents contract it by 35.

<P>
Rabies is a constant threat on both sides of the border. The report notes that 
in Laredo, Tex., across the border from the Mexican town of Nuevo Laredo, stray 
dogs bite more than 500 people a year. 
</P>
<P>
The report acknowledges that there have been some efforts in recent years to 
solve the problems. 
</P>
<P>
In October, President Bush and Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari 
reached a historic agreement to build a sewage plant in the United States to 
treat up to 25 million gallons of Tijuana waste daily. 
</P>
<P>
The plant would end pollution of the Tijuana River, which enters the Pacific 
north of the border and has contaminated beaches there for years. A 2 1/2-mile 
section of beach just north of the border has been closed for more than six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
A written agreement between the two nations to begin construction could be 
completed as early as next week, said Bob Ybarra, spokesman in El Paso for the 
International Boundary and Water Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, set up in 1889, is responsible for boundary and water issues 
between the two countries, while air pollution solutions are the responsibility 
of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Mexican Secretariat of Urban 
Development and Ecology. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA's efforts -- which the AMA notes are coordinated by people who live in 
Mexico City and Washington, not along the border -- and the water commission's 
work are not enough, said William C. Scott, chairman of the AMA's Council on 
Scientific Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Neither one has very effectively attacked the problems of the severe 
environmental deterioration that's happening along the border," Scott said. 
"The water commission does the water stuff and the EPA does the air stuff, and 
neither one of them pay attention to a lot of problems that fall in between." 
</P>
<P>
Although the AMA said the idea of a binational environmental health commission 
has been endorsed by health officials, cities and public health associations 
along the border, the Bush Administration says such a commission is 
unnecessary.

TRAVELING MAN QUAYLE SHOWS UP, BASHES DEMOCRATS; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: VICE PRESIDENT WINGS INTO CALIFORNIA TO AID REPUBLICAN CAUSES AND 
CANDIDATES, INCLUDING WILSON. 
</P>

<P>
Like a journeyman boxer spotting his opening, Vice President Dan Quayle on 
Tuesday jabbed his perennial punching bag, Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. 
Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
So what if Dukakis was doomed to defeat more than 19 months ago? Quayle, who 
spent much of the 1988 campaign berating Dukakis, pounded the Democrat's image 
once again at a Republican gathering in Los Angeles. This time, the beneficiary 
was not George Bush but Sen. Pete Wilson, locked in a tight race for governor 
with Democrat Dianne Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
"I think all of you know what having a Democrat in charge of other states has 
done -- like the state of Massachusetts," Quayle said, a growl creeping into 
his voice. "Let me tell you -- with Pete Wilson at the top of our ticket and 
Dianne Feinstein at the top of theirs, let's make a little pledge. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's pledge that the Democrats are never going to have a chance to do to 
California what they've done to the state of Massachusetts." 
</P>
<P>
His audience, predictably, chuckled and burst into applause. 
</P>
<P>
Almost two years after the rockiest entrance into national politics in memory, 
Quayle is bounding around the country at breakneck pace -- 85 cities, 45 states 
and 25 countries to his credit at last total. 
</P>
<P>
This week in California, he was doing what vice presidents do -- raising money 
and rallying the troops morning and night. Since Inauguration Day, Quayle has 
made his mark on the fund-raising circuit, with aides estimating the take for 
candidates and Republican Party benefits at $12 million. On Tuesday alone, he 
raised money for a congressional candidate, greeted high-powered donors to the 
Republican National Committee, and touted the statewide chances of Wilson and 
controller candidate Matt Fong at Fong's Westin Bonaventure fund-raiser, before 
flying to Sacramento for more handshaking. 
</P>
<P>
In-between, he also sat down for five television interviews to perform another 
traditional vice presidential task, supporting the President. Five times over, 
with equal earnestness each time, he defended Bush's lurch away from the 1988 
"no new taxes" pledge and his decision to call a moratorium on oil drilling off 
the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
"The President weighed all the facts," Quayle said, sounding much as Vice 
President Bush did before him. 
</P>
<P>
But Quayle's tenure has not mimicked Bush's in all ways. In his 
pre-presidential days, Bush had a thick resume but his personality was 
little-known. Quayle, if various national polls can be believed, is known, but 
perceived to be less than up to the job. That hangover from the 
rough-and-tumble 1988 campaign continues to haunt Quayle, despite dogged 
efforts to change the perception. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, Quayle brushed aside criticism of him, and took 
particular relish in knocking down rumors circulating in Washington that he 
will be off the ticket in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just rumor and misinformation that is out there in the public domain," he 
said as he sat in the back seat of his limousine, speeding up the Harbor 
Freeway toward Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very content where I am and there's not another job that I'd like to 
have," he said. "There is always idle, misguided speculation that comes up from 
time to time." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had made a substantial mark on the vice presidency -- as he had 
pledged to do before his inauguration -- Quayle said he has attempted to direct 
the office in the same way Bush did -- quietly, in confidence and behind the 
scenes. 
</P>
<P>
"We have certainly continued in the enhancement of the office," he said. Quayle 
said he took particular pride in his role in Latin America, where he has 
traveled six times in pursuing the Bush Administration agenda, and in helping 
to handle crises in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged that the behind-the-scenes activities do not lend 
themselves to defining a new image for him. 
</P>
<P>
"The office is not an office where you create a persona that is necessarily 
your own," he said. "You shouldn't try to say, 'Well, now let's see, here is 
the vice president's ideas. Here is the vice president's agenda. Here is the 
vice president's strategy.' There is no such animal. You just don't get that 
detailed definition of a person." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle aides assume that, barring a crisis, the vice president has little hope 
of rapidly remaking his image until the 1992 campaign. For now, Quayle is 
defining himself one-on-one -- shaking hands with Republican contributors, 
doing favors for GOP activists around the country, earning the chits that he 
hopes to cash in when he needs them. 
</P>
<P>
Most of that political work has been private, in closed fund-raisers. During 
his public events, when the effort is to raise enthusiasm more than money, 
Quayle has turned to Democrat-bashing with campaign zeal. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, even though the President had just conceded that taxes would be 
required to solve the deficit, Quayle slammed Democrats for "big government 
spending" and "habitual overtaxing and overspending." 
</P>
<P>
He did not mention Bush's statement on taxes. 
</P>
<P>
But with all the tough talk, there was also a regular-guy side to Quayle on 
show Tuesday. En route from his Century City hotel to the downtown Fong 
fund-raiser, he detoured into Chinatown and hopped from his limousine for a 
brief tour. 
</P>
<P>
At a crowded shop called Sincere Imports, he rifled through a selection of 
kites before picking up one shaped like a centipede. "For the kids -- and me," 
he joked as he left. He declined suggestions that he fly it, arguing that to do 
so was probably against the law. 
</P>
<P>
Across from the shop, he and Fong stopped at a pond into which visitors 
routinely throw coins at small bowls marked with wishes -- "happiness" among 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, penny in hand, took aim at a bowl marked "Promotion." It soared skyward 
-- and fell short.

EDUCATION LEADERS ASSAIL PLANNED CUTS 
</P>

Education leaders angrily complained Tuesday that they had been misled by Gov. 
George Deukmejian who, they said, won their support for a gasoline tax increase 
with the implicit understanding that he would not push for cuts in education 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
Less than a month after the voters approved a phased-in 9-cents-per-gallon 
gasoline tax increase, the governor is now proposing to cut education by $800 
million to help bridge a $3.6-billion gap in the state budget. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel like we've been betrayed," said Ed Foglia, president of the California 
Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Frost, Deukmejian's chief of staff, defended the governor's plan, 
saying that the budget crisis this year was so severe that no programs should 
escape austerity. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 111, a ballot measure approved by voters June 5, modified the state 
spending limit and triggered the gasoline tax increase as well as certain 
changes in the funding formulas set out for education in Proposition 98. In 
1988, despite the adamant opposition of Deukmejian, voters approved Proposition 
98, which guaranteed schools at least 40% of the state budget and provided 
yearly funding increases tied to enrollments and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the negotiations over Proposition 111, education leaders agreed to 
give up some of the money schools would have garnered under Proposition 98 in 
years when there was a budget surplus in return for changes in the formula that 
determines the amount they will get each year to compensate for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"The ink's not dry on . . . Proposition 111 and all of a sudden there's a 
recommendation (to) forget it -- it doesn't mean anything," said Supt. of 
Public Instruction Bill Honig. 
</P>
<P>
Both Honig and Kevin Gordon, director of government relations for the 
California School Boards Assn., said the governor's suggestion for cuts also 
violates the intent of Proposition 98. A clause in the initiative permits 
Proposition 98 to be suspended by a two-thirds vote of the Legislature in an 
"emergency." 
</P>
<P>
By emergency, they said the measure referred to a natural disaster such as an 
earthquake, not budget shortages that could be solved by other means.

JUDGE ASSISTS DEADLOCKED SILBERMAN JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The jury in Richard T. Silberman's money-laundering trial said Tuesday it is 
deadlocked and asked for help because it has yet to decide any of the charges 
against the San Diego financier. 
</P>
<P>
In response, and over defense objections, the federal judge presiding over the 
case provided further explanation of various legal terms, including the defense 
of entrapment, which Silberman has asserted. The complex case arose from an 
undercover FBI sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors, who resumed deliberations late Tuesday after receiving the new 
instructions from U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving, gave no indication 
whether they were close to a verdict on any or all of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, who once served as a top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown, is 
accused of laundering $300,000 that an undercover FBI agent allegedly 
characterized as the proceeds of Colombian drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
Though Silberman is standing trial on seven counts, the jury is considering 
only six. The seventh, which is Judge Irving's to decide, is a criminal 
forfeiture charge through which prosecutors are seeking the return of the 
stocks, bonds and cash involved in the case. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all six counts, Silberman could be sentenced to a maximum of 75 
years in prison. His trial began May 1. 
</P>
<P>
The case centers on two transactions involving cash supplied by the undercover 
FBI agent, Peter Ahearn, who was posing as a front man for Colombian drug 
lords. The first is a November, 1988, swap of $100,000 for stock in a Silberman 
gold-mining subsidiary. The second is a February, 1989, exchange of $200,000 
for U.S. Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman maintains that the first deal was a legitimate business transaction. 
He contends that he was coerced into the second by threats aimed at his family 
by a government informer. 
</P>
<P>
The last time the jury met to discuss the case was Friday. Within an hour of 
its arrival Tuesday at the downtown San Diego federal courthouse, the panel 
sent a note to Irving saying it was deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
Upon hearing that report, Silberman received a kiss from his wife, San Diego 
County Supervisor Susan Golding. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief hearing that was prompted by the note, jury foreman John T. Uliasz, 
a Santee nurse, told Irving that the panel had not reached a decision on any of 
the charges. The panel's verdict must be unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
However, Uliasz also said that the panel was ready to keep trying. In another 
note, Uliasz reported that jurors wanted "better definitions" of entrapment, 
which applies to all six counts, and to the term "structuring," which is at the 
center of one of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
In general, entrapment involves a situation where authorities induce an 
otherwise innocent person to commit a crime. "Structuring" is the term for the 
process of arranging a transaction to avoid the paper work federal law requires 
when more than $10,000 in cash changes hands. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said they wanted to know whether they could find that Silberman had been 
entrapped into the first transaction but not the second, or vice-versa. In 
addition, they asked whether they could find him innocent of one count because 
of entrapment but guilty on other counts. 
</P>
<P>
Irving told the panel that the answers to both questions were yes, since "all, 
some or none" of what Silberman did could be traced to entrapment. The jury was 
free to find some entrapment, no entrapment or nothing but entrapment and what 
result any of those possibilities had on the case, Irving said. 
</P>
<P>
Lead defense lawyer James J. Brosnahan strongly objected to Irving's answer, 
saying that, since the judge had already given the jury its instructions when 
it began its work last week, new material would make it seem that that Irving 
was pressuring the jury to reach a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
On the same grounds, Brosnahan also objected when the judge announced he would 
provide additional instruction on structuring. 
</P>
<P>
"We object to everything," Brosnahan said. "We object to each and every step 
that's proposed here." 
</P>
<P>
The jury had asked Irving to define when "structuring" began. Irving said that 
it is when a person "knowingly or willfully initiates or participates in 
initiating" a transaction designed to elude the reporting requirement. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth count in the case against Silberman charges him with directing a 
scheme to break the $100,000 supplied by FBI agent Ahearn in the first deal 
into sums under $10,000 for eventual transfer to Switzerland without any 
records.

NEW HURDLES BLOCKING OLYMPIC CENTER LOAN; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: ANGRY STATE LAWMAKERS WANT COLLATERAL -- AND ANSWERS -- BEFORE THEY'LL 
CONSIDER LENDING THE PROMISED $15 MILLION.

<P>
With a flurry of criticism and demands for more information, a key legislative 
budget committee Tuesday sent word that it wants a San Diego-based foundation 
to put up collateral before it receives a $15-million state loan toward 
construction of an Olympic training center in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
The six-member Assembly-Senate budget committee, however, stopped shy of 
scuttling the controversial loan altogether, holding out a thread of hope that 
the transaction could be restructured and salvaged during the waning days of 
state budget negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it was clear Tuesday that any approval from the committee, charged with the 
laborious job of working out the final details in the proposed 1990-1991 state 
budget, would come at a price. 
</P>
<P>
After openly criticizing state administrators Tuesday for writing a contract 
for the loan that called for only simple interest and no collateral, the 
lawmakers pressed demands to know more about who and what is behind the San 
Diego National Sports Training Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
They wanted to know about the foundation's financial strength, as well as the 
business activities of its board members, which include such prominent San 
Diegans as shopping center magnate Ernie Hahn and former San Diego City 
Councilwoman Gloria McColl. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like the analyst . . . to tell us who's on the foundation board, who 
makes up this foundation," said Assemblywoman Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), 
who raised the initial objections over the loan last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to know what their assets are. I'd like to know when it was 
originated, and I'd like to know what its operating budget is, aside from 
assets," she said. "Again, all of the principals and whatever other business 
they may be conducting at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday marked the second time in a little more than a week that the conference 
committee has balked at approving the loan, which was mandated under a state 
law passed last year to help with the construction of a state-of-the-art, 
$65-million Olympic training center on the western shore of Lower Otay Lake in 
Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The measure called for the $15 million, to be loaned over the next three years, 
be paid back through the sale of specialized Olympic training-center license 
plates. Preliminary plans call for the year-round training complex to be built 
by the end of 1992 by the foundation, which will then turn over title to the 
U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Worried that those license plate sales would fall far short of the promises of 
training center supporters, Gov. George Deukmejian signed the measure only 
after extracting the extra security that the foundation would sign a written 
guarantee to repay the remaining portions of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
The Times disclosed this month, however, that the transaction, as negotiated by 
the Department of Commerce, did not require the foundation to set aside 
financial reserves or assets to back up its obligation. A high-ranking Commerce 
official conceded that, without the safeguards, the state could lose the money 
if the foundation were to change its mind or become defunct. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, members of the state's Department of Finance and the independent 
Legislative Analyst office confirmed the absence of collateral, as well as the 
fact that the loan called for only simple interest and a liberal 20-year 
repayment schedule. The terms have especially raised objections, since 
lawmakers must make deep budget cuts in the face of an anticipated $3.6-billion 
shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
"Just a minute," said Assemblywoman Waters. "I've got a few foundations that 
would like to borrow some money, too, at simple interest and no collateral. 
It's the best deal going." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) called the proposed loan a "bad deal." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm amazed at (the Department of) Finance, as conservative as you are, that 
you think this is an appropriate loan without collateral," Seymour said. "That 
amazes me." 
</P>
<P>
When asked why state administrators didn't demand any collateral for the loan, 
LaFenus S. Stancell, an assistant director of the Department of Finance, 
explained that the original law didn't specifically spell out the requirement 
for such a financial safeguard. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't figure that out by yourself without the bill telling you?" asked 
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), who chaired the conference 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Vasconcellos then inquired what assets the foundation would have to back up the 
loan. "I don't know," Stancell said. 
</P>
<P>
"I do," Vasconcellos shot back. "It doesn't have any." 
</P>
<P>
The foundation's latest available public report, filed last November, showed 
that it lost more than $195,000 during 1988-1989. Foundation officials have 
told The Times, however, that they expect to end the year with a $3.5-million 
to $5 million surplus, an estimate predicated on the approval of the first 
$5-million installment of the state loan. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with his own objections and those of two other committee members, 
Vasconcellos appeared ready to declare the training center loan dead and move 
onto other budget items. 
</P>
<P>
But he suddenly drew back and allowed a glimmer of hope by suggesting that the 
staff go back to the foundation to renegotiate the loan to include collateral, 
the payment of compounded interest and repayment in less than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
In restructuring the loan, Seymour said he wanted to make sure of the 
collateral being offered by the foundation, if it agreed to renegotiate. 
</P>
<P>
"Some collateral's good, some collateral's bad," Seymour said. "I would like 
the . . . opinion as to what is reasonable and good business practice relative 
to repayment of the loan." 
</P>
<P>
David Neilsen, executive vice president of the foundation, declined Tuesday to 
say whether board members for the nonprofit group will be willing to reopen 
negotiations and offer the state collateral for the loan. 
</P>
<P>
"I need to get a little more clarification of exactly what happened today," 
Neilsen said in a telephone call to San Diego. "We had the bill last session. 
We do have an agreement."

CITY HIRES PSYCHOLOGISTS FOR POLICE TESTING 
</P>

<P>
The San Diego City Council on Tuesday approved contracts with two psychologists 
and two companies to screen candidates for police officers and provide 
counseling and training for existing officers. 
</P>
<P>
The contracts, the result of an extensive bidding process that began earlier 
this year, replace a single contract held for the past decade by Dr. Michael 
Mantell, a San Diego psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Ron Roberts on Tuesday directed the Police Department to report back 
in six months "on how the program is working. . . . This monitoring is going to 
be very important. . . . I'd like to know that we're getting our money's worth, 
so to speak." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Russell Gold and Dr. Ira Grossman will each receive $130 per Police 
Department job applicant screened during the one-year contract. The city 
manager's office calculated the total value of the contract at $76,898. 
</P>
<P>
Focus Psychological Services and Vista Hill Community Treatment Systems were 
awarded a $178,875 joint contract to provide psychological counseling and 
training for existing department employees. 
</P>
<P>
Both contracts are renewable for two additional years. 
</P>
<P>
Mantell had enjoyed a no-bid contract for the past decade, largely because few 
psychologists had the expertise needed to conduct the screening and counseling, 
Assistant City Manager Jack McGrory said in June. 
</P>
<P>
"There were very few (bidders) when Mantell first bid who were qualified to do 
this kind of work," he said. "But a lot has happened since then." 
</P>
<P>
McGrory described the recently completed bidding process as "competitive." 
</P>
<P>
The bidding, which drew 20 applicants for the two contracts, was overseen by 
representatives of the Police Department, the San Diego Society of Psychiatric 
Physicians and various city departments. Police Chief Bob Burgreen helped 
select the final candidates. 
</P>
<P>
To ensure that proper screening occurs, the department is "laying out 
expectations of service, right down to the detail about what amount of time" 
should be spent with applicants, department spokeswoman Elizabeth Fort said 
Tuesday. The department is also developing a manual that will include "do's and 
don'ts and areas that we have some concern about," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has not voiced any complaints about services provided by Mantell, who 
gained national attention after establishing the San Diego Police Department 
program and later helping officers who were traumatized in the 1984 McDonald's 
massacre in San Ysidro. Mantell also held a number of contracts with law 
enforcement agencies around the county. 
</P>
<P>
But some critics have questioned whether Mantell, who holds similar contracts 
with other law enforcement agencies in San Diego County, was able to service 
the Police Department adequately.

PORT BACKS USE OF B STREET PIER DURING AMERICA'S CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although no public money has yet been allocated, the America's Cup Organizing 
Committee won another round with the San Diego Unified Port District Tuesday, 
when its proposal to use the B Street Pier during the international sailing 
regatta was approved in concept. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas F. Ehman Jr., executive vice president of the Cup committee, said he was 
pleased with the board's decision. Still, despite numerous appearances before 
port commissioners in recent weeks, Cup officials have yet to be given a penny 
of the $10 million in public money they've requested. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Ehman said, "Everything is right on track. We feel good about 
things and don't anticipate any delays. Mr. (Don) Nay (director of the Port 
District) and everyone working with us have been really helpful." 
</P>
<P>
Ehman said the committee hopes to use the B Street Pier for administrative 
offices and as a Cup museum, as well as a media center designed to accommodate 
4,000 journalists from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Cup participants begin arriving in San Diego later this year, with the finals 
of the race scheduled in the waters off Point Loma in May, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Lynn Schenk voted with the other members in a 7-0 gesture to 
approve Ehman's request -- in principle -- but she, in particular, asked for 
more "bottom-line" figures on why port money is needed and what the Cup 
committee will use it for. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen a total, detailed plan yet on what the port is in for in 
supporting the America's Cup," Schenk said. "I support the America's Cup in 
concept, but to do this in a piecemeal way, bit by bit, as we've been doing, 
causes me concern." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor took several shots at the America's Cup 
committee in her appearance before the port to lobby for reimbursement for city 
services on port property. 
</P>
<P>
That part of the meeting was far more contentious than the portion devoted to 
the Cup, with Commissioner Dan Larsen grilling O'Connor and other city 
officials item by item on why they need money from the port. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of her appearance, O'Connor pointed her finger at the 
commissioners and said, "When you ask the attorney general to review our 
proposal, just make sure he reviews the money you plan to give the America's 
Cup and that it meets the same test." 
</P>
<P>
In the hallway, after she left, O'Connor said, "I can guarantee you the 
America's Cup committee will not go through what we went through in there 
today." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not worried about Mayor O'Connor," Ehman said. "She's told us privately 
she supports us. We believe she understands how much San Diego will benefit 
from the America's Cup. And the benefit will be considerable."

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: JAMUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The name of a woman who died of multiple stab wounds off California 94 in Jamul 
was released Tuesday by the coroner's office. Charlotte Ann Oakley, 29, was 
found by sheriff's deputies in brush about 20 feet off the road. 
</P>
<P>
Homicide Sgt. Steve Wood said Oakley's body was found about a mile west of 
Honey Springs Road about 3:30 a.m. Monday after witnesses saw Oakley arguing 
with Billy Winston Elias, 36, of the 4500 block Utah Street in North Park. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies were summoned to the area after witnesses said the man was holding on 
to the screaming Oakley. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies later spotted Elias driving a car matching one described by witnesses. 
He was arrested and booked into County Jail on suspicion of murder, Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
Oakley's address is still unknown. However, coroner's deputies said she is 
survived by her mother, who lives on the Barona Indian Reservation east of 
Lakeside.

An unshaded table lamp ignited the drapes of a Southeast San Diego residence 
Tuesday morning, but the fire was quickly subdued after the owner sprinted 
across the street to Fire Station 12 and alerted firefighters. No one was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
The dwelling, a triplex in the 100 block of Ozark Street, suffered $16,000 in 
structural and interior damage, according to Fire Department spokesman Jon 
McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
At 9:11 a.m., Linda White, 24, saw the fire and grabbed her sons Michael, 5, 
and Roosevelt, 3, and ran to the station. "They saw it and got right on it," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald said the fire was out in about seven minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze started after a curtain rubbed up against a bare light bulb, said 
Eddie Robertson, who lives next door and is White's brother. "The light was up 
against the curtain. Nobody detected it until it was too late," he said. "She's 
a little nervous, but she's happy nobody got hurt." 
</P>
<P>
White said the fire left the residence uninhabitable. "It totally destroyed the 
bedroom, but really the whole house and our belongings, too," she said.

<P>
The San Diego County district attorney's office said a police officer had a 
right to fire when he shot and wounded a man armed with a hatchet who was 
reportedly stealing street signs. 
</P>
<P>
In a report released by police Tuesday, the district attorney's office says it 
was reasonable for officer Randy Burgess to fire at Billy Joe Jackson on May 7 
when Jackson pulled a metal and wood object from his waistband, an object 
Burgess and his partner, Officer Stanley Peloza, believed to be a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Burgess fired once and struck Jackson in the right groin, police spokesman Dave 
Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the two officers had been summoned to the 3900 block of Boston 
Avenue shortly after 3 a.m., where they reportedly saw Jackson dragging a 
12-foot metal pole with street signs attached and an 8-foot pole. Thinking the 
man was deranged, Cohen said, the officers pulled their handguns and ordered 
Jackson to drop the poles, which he did. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Cohen said, the officers noticed the object, and Burgess yelled 
at Jackson to keep his hands up and turn around with his back to the officers. 
Instead, Jackson faced the officers and began to draw the hatchet, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the district attorney's review, which was sent to Chief Robert 
Burgreen last Wednesday, says Jackson was required to obey the officer's 
command to turn around, and it was reasonable for Burgess to conclude that 
Jackson intended to pull his hatchet.

<P>
Three men pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges Monday for their role in a 
scheme to con the Department of Defense's health insurance program out of an 
estimated $3 million in fraudulent claims. 
</P>
<P>
Max Sperling and his two sons, Craig Allen Sperling and Howard Aaron Sperling, 
worked as billing administrators for a group of affiliated medical clinics that 
submitted the claims to a San Diego-based corporation, a federal prosecutor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
That corporation, Centre City Funding, of the 7000 block of Friars Road, then 
relayed those claims to the Civilian Health and Medical Program for the 
Uniformed Services, a program administered by the Department of Defense, said 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Carol Lam. 
</P>
<P>
"These men conspired with Centre City Funding to create the fraudulent bills," 
Lam said. "We do not know how many of those claims were actually paid." 
</P>
<P>
According to Lam, the medical clinics solicited clients over the telephone and 
asked them to undergo unnecessary medical tests. The clinic's employees told 
the clients that the insurance companies would cover the costs of those tests, 
Lam said. 
</P>
<P>
Centre City Funding also submitted fraudulent claims to private insurance 
companies, Lam said. 
</P>
<P>
Three employees of Centre City Funding, Donald Bader, Minnie Marie Bader and 
Maria Manuela Souza, are scheduled to stand trial in Thursday, Lam said.

WORLD CUP: BELGIUM DOMINATES PLAY, BUT PLATT SCORES IN 119TH MINUTE FOR 1-0 
VICTORY. CAMEROON NEXT IN QUARTERFINALS.

<P>
Just as Argentina stole a game from Brazil on Sunday in Turin, so England stole 
one from Belgium here Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The final score showed the English winning, 1-0, on a goal by David Platt in 
the next-to-last minute of overtime, but the winners were booed off the field 
by many in the crowd of 34,520. 
</P>
<P>
The reason was not hard to understand: Belgium played far more creative, 
imaginative and positive soccer. Its attacking moves flowed, and it did not 
resort to brute force, as England often did, when the pressure was on. 
</P>
<P>
Belgian midfielder Vincenzo Scifo was clearly the best player on the field, but 
Scifo is heading home today, and the English players will be traveling south to 
Naples for what promises to be an intriguing quarterfinal clash with Cameroon 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
English Coach Bobby Robson refused to admit, though, that his team was 
second-best on this night. 
</P>
<P>
"Belgium had a bit more of the play in the second half," he said. "But we were 
always dangerous on the break. It was a very brave performance, with lots of 
fighting spirit and quality." 
</P>
<P>
That view was not widely held, but Belgian Coach Guy Thys, who led many of 
these same players to a fourth-place finish in Mexico four years ago, was 
gracious in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if it might not be better to play an unimaginative, physical game and win 
rather than an entertaining style and lose, Thys replied: "I think the winner 
is always right (but) if the match had to be replayed, I'd do it the same way. 
</P>
<P>
"We dominated for three-quarters of the match and hit the post (with shots) 
twice. Luck was not with us today. It was one of the best of our matches, but 
that's the way it goes." 
</P>
<P>
Both teams were unlucky not to score in the regulation 90 minutes, and, until 
Platt's game-winner, it looked as if the game might be decided on penalty 
kicks. 
</P>
<P>
But, in the 119th minute, Danish referee Peter Mikkelsen, who officiated well 
throughout the game, awarded England a free kick directly in front of the goal 
but about 40 yards out. Paul Gascoigne floated a high ball into the penalty 
area and Platt, taking a swing at it before it hit the ground, was almost as 
astonished as the Belgian goalkeeper to see the ball fly into the net. 
</P>
<P>
Platt was immediately mobbed, while Gascoigne ran to the English bench and was 
lifted off his feet. 
</P>
<P>
The Belgians, meanwhile, were shattered. The game had no sooner restarted when 
Mikkelsen blew the final whistle and their World Cup was over. 
</P>
<P>
How different it might have been had Scifo's shot in the 49th minute been a 
foot or so to the right instead of crashing into the left post -- just as Jan 
Ceulemans' shot had done in the 15th minute. Other Belgian chances went just 
wide or were saved by England's goalkeeper, Peter Shilton. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, England was unlucky to have an apparent goal by winger John 
Barnes disallowed in the 40th minute. Barnes took a pass from Gary Lineker and 
drove the ball into the net, but Austrian linesman Helmuth Kohl ruled that 
Barnes had been offside. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't seen the replay but my immediate thought was that it was a perfectly 
good goal," Robson said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about Scifo's shot that hit the post, Robson said: "It was a remarkable 
shot; he was desperately unlucky. 
</P>
<P>
"We've earned a very good victory against a pretty solid team. I thought we 
showed great ability and spirit. The team didn't die tonight. We're in the last 
eight, with Cameroon to play. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very cruel for Belgium. I know how Guy Thys feels." 
</P>
<P>
History suggested that one team or the other would score before the final 
whistle. Belgium had never been involved in a 0-0 tie in its 24 previous World 
Cup matches. 
</P>
<P>
Before the match, the coaches had sparred verbally, each playing a different 
hand. Robson chose to praise Belgium, while Thys' strategy was to be blunt 
about England's shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
"If the defense does its job, especially against Paul Gascoigne who is powerful 
and fast, Scifo, Ceulemans and (Marc) Degryse will easily manage to slip 
through the holes in the English defense," Thys had said. 
</P>
<P>
"England holds no secrets for me; it plays a game that is pretty easy to 
decipher and applies tactics that are certainly not inspired by the 
imagination." 
</P>
<P>
The quote might have spurred England, but Robson did not rise to the bait. 
</P>
<P>
"Belgium is a marvelous team, with one top footballer more than us -- Vincenzo 
Scifo," he said. "But it is also the team that plays football in the way most 
like us." 
</P>
<P>
Not the way the game was played Tuesday night, however. Then, Belgium was in a 
class by itself. But, as Argentina had shown by beating a far superior Brazil, 
1-0, on Sunday, it is not always the better team that wins. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of Sunday's England-Cameroon game will play either West Germany or 
Czechoslovakia in the semifinals in Milan on July 4.

EIGHT-RUN RALLY WASTED BY ANGELS AS WHITE SOX WIN; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: AFTER CLUB COMES BACK FROM A 9-1 DEFICIT TO TIE, CHICAGO SCORES TWICE 
IN THE NINTH, 11-9.

<P>
Bert Blyleven came undone, and the Angels looked done for. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago White Sox scored seven runs in the sixth inning Tuesday -- five 
against Blyleven, whose last act was to give up a three-run home run to Ivan 
Calderon. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Angels, once down by eight runs, scored six in the seventh, and it was 
a ballgame. They tied the score with a run in the eighth -- only to see the 
White Sox win, 11-9, in the ninth inning with two runs on four hits before 
28,401 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
It was a wild one -- "a crazy game, Holy Christmas!" White Sox Manager Jeff 
Torborg said. 
</P>
<P>
Ozzie Guillen's run-scoring single to right off Mark Eichhorn drove in Ron 
Karkovice with the tie-breaking run in the ninth. Another run scored on Lance 
Johnson's bunt single. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not frustrating because these people persevered," said Angel Manager Doug 
Rader, who inserted three players after the White Sox's big inning, only to see 
those players, Kent Anderson, Max Venable and John Orton, help spark the rally. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't exactly hot on their heels," Rader said. The switches were in part 
because the Angels have a day game today. "And you want to try to change the 
feel of the game. What the heck, those players got us back in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Eichhorn, the Angels' ace reliever who entered the game with a 1.33 earned-run 
average, pitched the ninth, and took the loss, his fourth without a victory. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Jones (9-1), the White Sox's fifth pitcher, earned the victory. Bobby 
Thigpen pitched the ninth for the save, his major league-leading 25th. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had tied the score in the eighth on Luis Polonia's sacrifice fly to 
shallow left, which scored Dante Bichette when Dave Gallagher's throw couldn't 
get him. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had the game," Polonia said. "I said, 'This is it, right here.' 
I'm thinking to bring both runners in, or expecting somebody else to bring the 
other in, but we're not perfect. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a crazy one because all of a sudden we feel we have no chance, but we 
put our heads down and did the best we can. I think sometimes it's better to 
lose, 9-1, and take it that way." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven, who gave up seven runs, said he only regretted that the comeback 
changed the accounting of blame. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of wish I got the loss because I didn't pitch so well," he said. 
"That's probably the most frustrating thing. But it showed a lot of character 
in our team." 
</P>
<P>
By the time the White Sox's sixth was done, the Angels trailed by eight runs. 
</P>
<P>
That much was remarkable. That they brought the go-ahead run to the plate in 
the seventh was just short of incredible. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels got one run back on Wally Joyner's home run in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
They led off the seventh with back-to-back singles by Chili Davis and Orton, 
who had replaced Lance Parrish at catcher in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
That was enough to chase Adam Peterson. Donn Pall came on, and gave up a 
run-scoring single to Bichette. 
</P>
<P>
Pall got Jack Howell to fly out, but walked Dick Schofield. Polonia forced 
Schofield at second with a grounder for the second out, but Orton scored on the 
play. Anderson, in the game as a replacement at second base, reached safely 
when his sharply hit grounder bounced high and away off the glove of shortstop 
Guillen for an error, with Bichette scoring and Polonia taking third. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Edwards came on in relief, and walked Joyner, loading the bases. Venable, 
another of the Angels' mid-game replacements, worked to a full count and 
walked, driving in Polonia. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox brought Scott Radinsky to the mound, and Davis, batting for the 
second time in the inning, sent him back off it with a two-run single to center 
that brought the Angels to within 9-8. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Jones came on to pitch -- the fifth White Sox pitcher of the inning -- 
and got Orton to strike out. (The five White Sox pitchers in the inning were 
one short of the major league record of six set by Oakland on Sept. 23, 1983, 
against Cleveland.) 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven, trying for his sixth victory in his last seven starts, gave up a solo 
homer to Karkovice in the second, and a run in the third on a walk followed by 
a double by Calderon. 
</P>
<P>
But in the sixth, all semblance of order disappeared. Karkovice, who had 
singled, scored on Sammy Sosa's triple to right. Johnson singled, driving in 
Sosa. Robin Ventura singled, and then came Calderon's three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Bailes came on to replace Blyleven, and got Dan Pasqua to ground to first 
base. But Joyner missed the ground ball, with Pasqua reaching on the two-out 
error as the ball rolled behind Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
It proved an expensive mistake. Moments later, Ron Kittle hit Bailes' first 
pitch deep into the left field stands for a two-run homer. Both runs were 
unearned. 
</P>
<P>
"You gotta give them a lot of credit, being down 9-1 and coming back," Torborg 
said. "But you gotta give us credit too." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Former Dodger and Angel Jerry Reuss, released by Houston's triple-A Tucson team 
May 14, was in a White Sox uniform Tuesday, saying he can still pitch in the 
major leagues. "If I thought I was finished, I'd say so," said Reuss, 41, who 
worked out with the team with the permission of Manager Jeff Torborg. Reuss, 
who last pitched in the majors with Milwaukee last season, had a 
spring-training tryout with the White Sox as a non-roster invitee, and worked 
as a reliever with Houston's double-A and triple-A teams before his release.

the third consecutive day. X-rays of the ribs were negative, trainer Ned 
Bergert said.

DAVE DISTEL: ATLANTA LOSS WAS SICKENING SEQUEL FOR PADRES

Turn the scriptwriters loose. This is perfect for a made-for-television movie. 
Studios will be fighting for the rights. 
</P>
<P>
Call it "Back to the Past." 
</P>
<P>
And this isn't exactly a blast from the past. This is a bummer revisited. 
</P>
<P>
Michael J. Fox won't get a role in this one. This is no comedy. This is a spot 
for Vincent Price or Boris Karloff. This one will be rated R, not for violence 
but rather for being downright gruesome. 
</P>
<P>
What we are talking about is the Padres and the ways they find to lose baseball 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Back to the past? 
</P>
<P>
Remember Houston? 
</P>
<P>
That's right, Houston. It was early June of 1989, and the Padres were about to 
turn the Astrodome into a House of Horrors. 
</P>
<P>
Let's grimace and reminisce . . . 
</P>
<P>
June 6 -- Padres lead, 7-4, with no one on and two out in the ninth. Suddenly, 
the bases are loaded and the score is 7-6. Mark Davis throws strike three past 
a swinging Alex Trevino. Whew! Whew? The ball is in the dirt, skipping to 
Benito Santiago's left. He retrieves it and tags Ken Caminiti charging home 
from third, but the ball pops loose again, and the tying run scores. 
</P>
<P>
Houston wins in the 10th when Bip Roberts bobbles Glenn Davis' single and Bill 
Doran scores from first. It is Mark Davis' first loss. 
</P>
<P>
Final: 8-7, Houston. 
</P>
<P>
June 8 -- Padres lead, 5-1, going into the ninth, but neither Eric Show nor 
Mark Davis can close it out. However, the Padres score in the 10th to take a 
6-5 lead. But . . . Glenn Davis hits a two-run homer -- off Mark Davis -- in 
the bottom of the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Final: 7-6, Houston. 
</P>
<P>
When the Padres were so close and yet too far from San Francisco in the final 
days of the season, we kept hearing "what if" they had won those games in 
Houston. Those two games haunted them all summer long and into fall and through 
the winter. 
</P>
<P>
You don't lament the 7-2 losses or 5-1 losses or even 3-2 losses. You lament 
the wins that take horribly unexpected twists and turn instead into losses. 
</P>
<P>
Houston can now be put to rest. That was last year's nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who had the misfortune of tuning into Channel 51 on Sunday afternoon 
knows where I am coming from and where I am going. 
</P>
<P>
That was Stupor Sunday. That was the day the Padres went back to the past. 
</P>
<P>
This was a game the Padres at first had no business winning and then no 
business losing. This was a day in which they went from heroes to goats and 
from geniuses to dunces in almost the length of time it takes to run one of 
their silly promotional commercials . . . Comprende? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, it might well have been a Sunday to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
After all, Atlanta had a 7-6 lead with two out in the ninth, only to have the 
Padres draw even when Jack Clark walked and Mike Pagliarulo doubled. 
</P>
<P>
Given new life, the Padres put together an inning fit for a highlight film. 
Actually, it wasn't a whole inning. It was a swing. Dennis Rasmussen, of all 
people, pinch-hit and drove a three-run double to right-center in the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
Things were downright giddy in the dugout. This struggling little crew had 
seemingly been hit by an industrial strength jolt of adrenaline. A victory like 
this could pick things up and turn them around. 
</P>
<P>
Except . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Blauser hit a three-run home run off Craig Lefferts in the bottom of the 
10th to tie the game. This was a little bit like fighting off a pack of wolves 
and then dying of a flea bite. Jeff Blauser? 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Padres would have a chance to survive, but for an umpire who could 
not see and a base-runner who could not count. 
</P>
<P>
Bip Roberts was on first in the 12th when Robbie Alomar hit a ground ball to 
Atlanta shortstop Andres Thomas. Hesitant at first, Thomas double-pumped and 
threw too late to second to get Roberts. The only problem was that umpire 
Charlie Reliford called him out. 
</P>
<P>
When Tony Gwynn followed with a single, Roberts would have scored the 
tie-breaking run. As it turned out, Gwynn's single succeeded only in advancing 
Alomar to second. 
</P>
<P>
It was at this point that Alomar lost track of where he was and what the 
situation was. When Joe Carter flied deep to center, Alomar loped around third 
as if two were out . . . rather than one. When his screaming teammates awakened 
him, he took a shortcut back to second and was ultimately called out for 
failing to re-cross third base. 
</P>
<P>
End of inning. 
</P>
<P>
One swing later, one swing into the Braves' 12th, the game was over. 
</P>
<P>
Andres Thomas hit a home run off Lefferts to give the Braves an 11-10 victory . 
. . and the Padres an 11-10 loss. Andres Thomas? 
</P>
<P>
This was every bit as shattering as Houston '89. What was more frightening this 
time was that this game was almost a microcosm of what 1990 has been thus far 
to the Padres. This game was up and down and in and out and ultimately 
determined by yet more home run pitches and yet another embarrassing mental 
lapse. 
</P>
<P>
Stupor Sunday won't cost the Padres the pennant, but what it represents will.

ROOKIE EQUALS BILLING, STYMIES DODGERS, 4-2

<P>
Steve Avery took a big step toward fulfilling the Braves' expectations Tuesday 
with one dramatic pitch. 
</P>
<P>
It was the bottom of the seventh inning, two out and runners on first and 
second. Dodger Mickey Hatcher was at the plate representing the tying run. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher, with 12 years of major league experience, was guessing fastball. 
Avery, with three games of experience, was throwing a fastball. 
</P>
<P>
Hatcher saw it, swung at it, and expected it to fly. But then the ball ducked. 
</P>
<P>
"Next thing I know, the ball was in the catcher's mitt," Hatcher said. "I 
thought I was right on it . . . and I barely tipped it." 
</P>
<P>
The foul-tip strikeout eventually led to a 4-2 victory for the Braves before 
12,257 at Atlanta Fulton County Stadium. And in Avery, who recorded his first 
major league victory, a star was born. Well, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a young phenom, huh?" asked Dodger Stan Javier, who had a hit and an 
RBI. "I don't know about that. He was good. But that's just one game." 
</P>
<P>
Added Mike Sharperson, who went hitless: "He has pretty decent stuff. I think 
he will be a good pitcher. One day." 
</P>
<P>
Excuse them for being grumpy, but the loss dropped the Dodgers to 11 1/2 games 
behind the National League West-leading Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers left 10 runners on base, including three at third base and two at 
second base. Dodger starter Mike Morgan, staked to a 1-0 lead before he even 
took the mound, then gave up singles to the first three hitters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
He then walked Dave Justice, forcing in a run. Morgan previously had walked 
only 22 in 99 2/3 innings, fewest among Dodger starters. 
</P>
<P>
A double-play grounder by Dale Murphy scored another first-inning run, and the 
Dodgers never caught up. 
</P>
<P>
In their final chance, against relief pitcher Joe Hesketh in the ninth, 
pinch-hitter Kirk Gibson grounded to first base with a runner on first. Gibson 
was making his first appearance since suffering a groin injury June 18. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to get out of here," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said as he hurried 
from his office after meeting with the media. "I feel terrible." 
</P>
<P>
In the other clubhouse, a young pitcher with spiked hair and a shy smile was 
also trying to leave quickly, but for different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to call home and then see my girlfriend," Avery said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey," yelled fellow starter John Smoltz, "it's past the kid's bedtime." 
</P>
<P>
Relieved Atlanta officials looked as if they've been waiting up all night for 
Avery. The left-handed pitcher was their first pick, and third overall 
selection, in the 1988 June draft. After two outstanding seasons in the minor 
leagues, he and Texas Ranger outfielder Rueben Sierra were picked last winter 
by a national baseball publication as the two players most likely to be stars 
in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
After 13 starts at triple-A Richmond this summer, he was recalled June 13. In 
his Brave debut, he was shelled by the Cincinnati Reds for eight runs in 2 1/3 
innings. He lost again to the Reds six days later. 
</P>
<P>
His problem in both games was that he had only his fastball. But from the first 
inning Tuesday, against a team he said he has always respected, Avery showed he 
had everything. Especially his composure. 
</P>
<P>
He walked Javier on four pitches to start the game, and two outs later Javier 
scored on a single by Eddie Murray. But Avery didn't allow another hit for 5 
2/3 innings, until pinch-hitter Jose Gonzalez started the Dodger rally in the 
seventh with a one-out single. Javier then singled, but Sharperson grounded out 
and Hatcher struck out for only the ninth time this season to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
Avery left the game after giving up four hits and one run in seven innings. He 
particularly frustrated Juan Samuel, who went hitless in four at-bats with 
runners on base. Samuel has four hits in his last 49 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got an exploding fastball," Brave Manager Bobby Cox said of Avery. "He is 
a power pitcher who can also mess up guys' minds." 
</P>
<P>
Beating the Dodgers is special, Avery said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows about the Dodgers -- but I would have taken this first one 
against anybody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan's advice for the youngster was to enjoy the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"He can dig himself tonight, and maybe tomorrow morning a little bit, but then 
he has to start thinking about the next game," said Morgan (7-6), who gave up 
three runs in six innings. "There's always a next game." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jim Presley, third baseman for the Braves, was arrested Tuesday on a battery 
warrant sworn out by his mother, Lucinda Brazel. Presley allegedly yelled at 
Brazel and pushed her when she showed up unannounced at his apartment at 1 a.m. 
Tuesday after traveling from her home in Pensacola, Fla., authorities said. 
They said Brazel was bruised from the incident. Presley learned of the warrant 
at 3:30 p.m. when he reported to Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium for Tuesday 
night's game. Presley went to the Rockdale County jail, where he posted $1,000 
bond and was released. He was held out of the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Kal Daniels is scheduled to fly to Los Angeles early today to have 
his back examined by Dr. Robert Watkins. Daniels said he twisted his back after 
geting a fifth-inning single Friday in Cincinnati. "It's stiff, sore, painful, 
everything," Daniels said. "It just isn't getting any better." Kirk Gibson's 
strained groin muscle improved enough that he pinch-hit Tuesday, his first 
action since suffering the injury June 18. . . . Eddie Murray was handed the 
fifth Dodger ejection of the season after arguing a third-strike call with home 
plate umpire Dana DeMuth in the eighth inning.

WHAT'S LUCK GOT TO DO WITH IT? SPAIN LOSES TO YUGOSLAVIA 
</P>

After outplaying Yugoslavia for 90 minutes -- as the Spanish coach was quick to 
point out -- Spain lost to Yugoslavia, 2-1 in overtime, Tuesday in the second 
round of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
It hardly mattered that Spain, which before Tuesday had not lost in the 
tournament, came back from a 1-0 deficit to tie in the 84th minute and send the 
game into overtime. What mattered was that Yugoslavia's hard work and 
resiliency paid off. 
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslavs will play defending champion Argentina in the quarterfinals 
Saturday in Florence. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish Coach Luis Suarez was almost defiant in defeat, calling his team the 
better squad and, in one of the tournament's more ungracious moments, saying 
that Yugoslavia had merely been luckier, not more skilled. 
</P>
<P>
"We must agree on this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And lucky the Yugoslavs were, lucky to have midfielder Dragan Stojkovic, who 
scored both of his team's goals and was clearly the best player on the field. 
</P>
<P>
Lucky they were, too, that the game did not extend beyond the two 15-minute 
overtime periods in 90-degree heat of late afternoon. Bentegodi Stadium was 
humid, too, but not because of crowding fans. Officials announced ticket sales 
of 35,500 but the small municipal stadium was only two-thirds full. 
</P>
<P>
Those who were there saw listless play until late in the second half. The 
Yugoslavs -- called the Brazilians of Europe for their sometimes dazzling 
creativity -- showed that form in scoring their first goal. 
</P>
<P>
Zlatko Vujovic beat a Spanish defender and sent a pass to Srecko Katanec. 
Katanec headed the ball up to Stojkovic, who scored in the 78th minute from 
about eight yards in front of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
Spain came back six minutes later, using similar pinpoint passing. From deep in 
the Yugoslav penalty area, Rafael Martin Vazquez sent a slashing pass to Julio 
Salinas, who had an easy tap-in. 
</P>
<P>
Stojkovic scored the winning goal in the first overtime on a free kick he 
lofted over a five-man wall, putting it softly into the right corner of the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
The game had its odd moments, but it had nothing on the behavior of the coaches 
after the match. Yugoslavia's Ivica Osim has kept his team isolated throughout 
the tournament and has maintained silence with the media. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, he announced at the postgame news conference that he would make a 
short statement and would not answer any questions. 
</P>
<P>
His statement: 
</P>
<P>
"It was very hard for our team in the heat. It was a game of difficult 
introductions. We were in a difficult situation. We won but the Spanish could 
have. They would have deserved it. It is not saying we were lucky, but we 
scored more goals." 
</P>
<P>
With that, Osim fled the room, leaving a gap in the program that translators 
filled by repeating the statement four times, in five languages, sort of the 
best of Ivica Osim, although not by request. 
</P>
<P>
That left more time for Suarez, who made the worst of it. He harped on luck and 
how it was a factor in the game. And life. And world affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day everyone says we have been lucky," Suarez said. "We were not lucky 
today. We are not to be blamed. We have fought, we have played much better than 
our opponent. The outcome is not fair. We were absolutely unlucky. That is all 
I can say." 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't. Suarez repeated that Spain deserved to have won, and, 
statistically and stylistically, he had a strong point. Spain had 19 shots on 
goal to Yugoslavia's 12, but the most telling number was of corner kicks -- 
Spain's 16 to Yugoslavia's 1. That alone gives some idea of Spain's field 
position for most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"We dominated the game from the beginning to the end," Suarez said. "We had 
many more chances. We played very well. But it did not make a difference. The 
difference in the match was that we were not lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, but Yugoslavia can hardly be called a surprise. The Yugoslavs came into 
the World Cup undefeated in qualifying and with the best record of any European 
team. Yugoslavia was second in Group D after the first round, a tough group 
that included West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Suarez seemed determined to undermine his opponent. 
</P>
<P>
"The Yugoslavs taught nothing to us," Suarez said. "Yugoslavia played very well 
but they were not better than the Spaniards. We must agree on this." 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish national team beat Yugoslavia on May 26 in a friendly match in 
Yugoslavia. Suarez warned before Tuesday's match that the previous meeting 
"meant nothing." 
</P>
<P>
On this we must agree.

246 ENGLISH FANS ARE EXPELLED AFTER 2-HOUR FIGHT WITH ITALIANS

In what a British spokeswoman called "the worst incident involving English 
fans" at the World Cup, 246 backers of England's soccer team were taken into 
custody and then expelled from Italy on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities sent them back to England on an airliner chartered by the Italian 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty people were treated in hospitals for injuries sustained in the two-hour 
battle at Rimini, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident happened after Italian fans started celebrating Italy's 2-0 
victory over Uruguay in Rome on Monday night. English fans drinking in a bar 
"started throwing bottles at the Italians and car windows were smashed," 
British Embassy spokeswoman Kay Coombs said. 
</P>
<P>
FIFA, soccer's governing body, rejected a West German appeal to overturn the 
one-game suspension of Rudi Voeller for a red card he received in the 2-1 
victory over the Netherlands last Sunday. Voeller is barred from the World Cup 
quarterfinal game Sunday against Czechoslovakia.

SANCHEZ VICARIO WASTES 4 MATCH POINTS, LOSES TO NAGELSEN

"What you can do?" Arantxa Sanchez Vicario said when she lost in the second 
round of the French Open three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
She was saying the same thing Tuesday after blowing four match points and 
losing her first-round Wimbledon match, 1-6, 7-6 (10-8), 9-7, to Betsy 
Nagelsen. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, ranked No. 6, wasted two match points in the tiebreaker and two more 
in the 12th game of the third set. Then she led, 40-0, serving at 7-7, only to 
be broken, and Nagelsen, ranked No. 83, served out the match at love. 
</P>
<P>
The top five women players had no such trouble with their opening matches. No. 
1-seeded Steffi Graf defeated fellow West German Claudia Porwick, 6-1, 6-2; No. 
2 Martina Navratilova defeated Sophie Amiach of France, 6-1, 6-1; No. 3 Monica 
Seles defeated Maria Standlund of Sweden, 6-2, 6-0; No. 4 Gabriela Sabatini 
defeated Elise Burgin, 6-3, 6-3, and No. 5 Zina Garrison defeated Samantha 
Smith of England, 6-2, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Graf's only problem came after the match. Last week, West German police 
arrested a woman and charged her with attempting to extort money from Peter 
Graf, whom she claimed had fathered her child. Peter Graf is Steffi's father. 
</P>
<P>
"I am concentrating very much on my tennis right now, and I think the tough 
times have been pretty much over, and they have been in the last couple of 
weeks," Graf told reporters after her victory. "So I think I got it pretty much 
out of my mind right now." 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova, 33, is seeking a record ninth Wimbledon title. She might be the 
sentimental choice to win, but Navratilova said it doesn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
"There could be two people in the stands, and I'd still want to win it just as 
bad," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Eighth-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez withdrew before her match because of a knee 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Capriati, 14, seeded No. 12 in her first Wimbledon, made her debut at 
Centre Court and scored a 6-3, 6-1 victory over Helen Kelesi. Capriati said 
Wimbledon's show court is unparalleled. "It's like the court," she said. "When 
I found out I was going to be playing on it, I was so excited. I was jumping up 
and down." 
</P>
<P>
She will be on Court No. 14 today for her second-round match against Julie 
Halard of France.

The Anaheim city council approved final agreements with a New York developer 
for construction of a 19,500-seat indoor sports arena. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed $100-million arena, tentatively scheduled to be completed by 
September of 1992, is the second major indoor sports facility planned for 
Orange County, following the Santa Ana city council's previous approval of a 
privately owned and operated 20,000-seat facility.

BIOLOGISTS EXPECT ALBACORE MIGRATION TO BE MODEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
For the albacore fisherman wondering if, when and where the tuna are going to 
appear, the National Marine Fisheries Service has issued its annual forecast, 
based mainly on oceanic conditions throughout the species' migratory routes. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists with the NMFS-Southwest Fisheries Center in La Jolla say there will 
be modest to moderate landings this season, but prospects "could improve with 
more favorable ocean conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Southland anglers, the highest availability of albacore will 
likely be in the waters off the Pacific Northwest, with the tuna arriving in 
late July. 
</P>
<P>
One area with the highest potential for sportfishing will be off the Columbia 
River and Grays Harbor, the service says. 
</P>
<P>
Southern and Central California fishermen face poorer prospects, but they could 
improve "substantially" in the Southern California Bight "if there is a 
reasonably successful migration of fish into the bight from offshore regions," 
the service says. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that prospects appear good for the appearance of other exotic 
species of fish -- including tuna -- which the service says will come within 
reach of the San Diego sportfishing fleet as summer progresses. 
</P>
<P>
"Warm-water currents flowing northward along the coast of Baja California 
should provide an avenue to bring in bigeye and yellowfin tuna, skipjack, 
dorado and other highly desirable exotic fish," the bulletin said. 
</P>
<P>
The service will pay $2 and give a baseball cap with a special albacore tagging 
logo to anyone returning a yellow albacore tag. It will buy any albacore -- at 
the cannery price -- and pay $50 for any fish carrying a red tag. Information 
must include where, when and how the fish was caught, and its length from the 
tip of the lower jaw to the tail. 
</P>
<P>
Marlin season officially gets underway next week. And although 
first-marlin-of-the-year honors won't be up for grabs -- they were taken by 
Huntington Harbour's Sean McWhinney, whose eight years of fishing experience 
paid off New Year's Day with a 110-pound striper off Point Loma -- anglers 
figure to be out in force for the July 4 holiday period. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't have any flags to give out for the first marlin, but we'll have one 
to give for the first marlin released," said Helen Smith of the Balboa Angling 
Club. Neither the Balboa club, Avalon Seafood or the San Diego Marlin Club -- 
the Southland's primary weigh stations -- have reported any marlin caught. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't weighed any yet, but the commercial boats have been spotting them 
all week," said Rosie Cadman at Avalon. 
</P>
<P>
Her son, Jon, added: "One guy -- he was best man at my wedding and I was best 
man at his wedding so he has no reason to be pulling my leg -- said he saw four 
marlin just right here off the Avalon Bank." 
</P>
<P>
How far does a striped marlin travel? 
</P>
<P>
One caught and tagged off New Zealand turned up more than 8,000 miles away in 
French Polynesia. 
</P>
<P>
The striper had enjoyed 233 days of freedom before being caught for a second 
time by a Japanese long-line vessel northwest of the Marquesas Islands in the 
Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Three world-record catches off the Southern and Baja California coast were 
recently approved by the International Game Fish Assn.: 
</P>
<P>
 -- An 8-pound 11-ounce sand bass, caught off Oceanside on July 1, 1989, by 
Dave Bruce, all-tackle category. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 14-pound 13-ounce California halibut, caught in Santa Monica Bay on Dec. 
3, 1989, by Chris Hart, 4-pound category. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 114-pound 10-ounce striped marlin, caught off Cabo San Lucas on Jan. 31, 
1990, by Elizabeth Hogan, a women's 4-pound category. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually all bass fishing tournaments are now catch-and-release, but few leave 
the fishery better off than before. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California-based American Bass Assn. planted 8,000 three-inch 
Florida largemouths and 40 breeders during its tournament at Lake Isabella near 
Bakersfield recently, hoping to bolster the lake's bass population. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the ABA and the Ventura Bass Club placed 100 adult lemon trees into 
Lake Casitas near Ventura to improve bass habitat. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Fish and Game doesn't stock bass -- only trout and catfish -- 
and is unable to help financially, so bass anglers have to look out for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>

IT'S BASS-O-MATIC; 
</P>
<P>
FISHERMEN ARE EXCITED ABOUT BIG CATCHES OF THE BIG FISH, PARTICULARLY SINCE NO 
ONE IS SURE HOW LONG IT WILL LAST

<P>
With conditions on the ocean fair and the bite described by most at the landing 
as "wide open," Bob McCord's charter aboard the Pacific Dawn figured to 
transpire a little differently than his previous trips. 
</P>
<P>
The directors' chairs that his group always brings along -- to make angling for 
bottom fish more relaxing and, at times, downright comedic -- could not be 
placed on the deck, he was told by the crew. The action would be too fast, they 
said. The fish they were after would be too powerful to battle from such a 
chair. 
</P>
<P>
"We always bring the chairs," McCord said, admitting they get in the way, 
kicked and tripped upon by anyone chasing his hooked fish up and down the rail. 
He did not protest the matter, especially when told the fish he would be 
catching are much larger, faster and physically demanding than any rockfish he 
was used to plucking from the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Destination: the south end of Santa Rosa Island, the latest of the Channel 
Islands in which white sea bass have recently appeared in large schools. The 
area had become clogged with squid, on which the sea bass were gorging. 
</P>
<P>
As had been the case earlier in the month off Santa Catalina Island, the sea 
bass had taken the sportfishing landings by surprise. Since Steve Kelly of the 
Island Tak first found the fish on June 17, when his 13 passengers loaded up 
their sacks with 17 sea bass to 50 pounds, landings from Port Hueneme to Santa 
Barbara were abuzz with activity. 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen were stepping off boats with tales of battles against the large and 
powerful croakers -- and carrying bags full of delicious filets as proof. 
Others were inquiring if what they had heard was true -- that huge sea bass 
were there for the taking! 
</P>
<P>
"The phones have been ringing off the hook; it's been crazy," said Rick Grant, 
manager of Cisco's Sportfishing here. "People were calling Western Outdoor News 
trying to verify the bite." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby Port Hueneme had reported 169 fish taken in three days. The Sea Hawk out 
of Santa Barbara, with Merit McCrea at the helm, had taken 48 in a day. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, John Shull, the Pacific Dawn's owner and skipper, was angry. His 
boat was fresh from drydock, where it was re-outfitted for his annual 
summertime tuna stint out of Fisherman's Landing in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
McCord's group was late, and Shull explained that an early start was necessary 
if this was to be a successful trip. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't know it's important to be here early," he said. "There'll be a lot 
of boats going out and they'll scatter the squid." 
</P>
<P>
Catching enough squid for bait turned out to be the least of Shull's worries. 
Shortly after departure, a bright glow appeared in the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
"Those are the seiners," Shull said. "They're going to scoop out all the 
squid." 
</P>
<P>
The commercial purse seiners had found the squid. And the gill-netters had 
found the sea bass -- a combination that can devastate a bite as fast as it 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, lights from the Pacific Dawn and at least a dozen other charter vessels 
shone brightly into the water, but turned up little in the way of squid, which 
are attracted by light. 
</P>
<P>
The squid that weren't caught in the seiners' nets were scattered and spooked. 
The passengers, using special lures to pluck the cephalopods from the water and 
release them unharmed into the bait tanks, managed only a few dozen before 
dawn's light indicated that it was time to fish. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the sea bass weren't cooperating either. The Pacific Dawn took 
only one -- of about 40 pounds -- after several hours of fishing. Most of the 
other boats reported similar results. 
</P>
<P>
It became apparent there would be no big counts of white sea bass on this day, 
and a move was made to a nearby location known for its variety of bottom fish. 
As for McCord and his group, they went straight for the directors' chairs. 
</P>
<P>
Lines were dropped to the bottom, and compliance by the fish was almost 
instantaneous. Red snapper and rock cod were brought over the rail. Blue bass 
and ocean whitefish were stuffed into sacks. A 15-pound lingcod dragged one 
angler halfway around the boat before being plucked by the gaff and sliced into 
filets. 
</P>
<P>
Bags were filled, and chartermaster McCord was content with attaining his 
objective of merely getting away from business at his Sagebrush Cantina in 
Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter," he said when asked if he was dissatisfied at not catching 
any white sea bass. "You eat, you sleep, you fish -- it's totally relaxing." 
</P>
<P>
That night, more squid moved into the area, and the white sea bass followed. 
</P>
<P>
Shull reported catching several during a 2 a.m. run. "We even caught a few 
black sea bass," he said. "One of them weighed about 200 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
But the seiners were still in the area, and as Shull said: "There was gill-net 
gear spread all through the area." 
</P>
<P>
Another bite has since come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
The white sea bass is noted for its sizzling first run on hook and line, and 
stubborn resistance thereafter; for its size and strength -- the all-tackle 
world record is 83 pounds 12 ounces -- and for the taste of its flesh. 
</P>
<P>
It has always been a favorite target among the Southland's saltwater fishermen. 
It would roam the kelp beds along the coast and just off the nearby islands. 
Divers tracked the large fish by listening to them croak. Fishermen using 
sardines would await the season eagerly, their gear and hearts ready for the 
species' springtime arrival. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that we could really count on a white sea bass run in several 
areas," said Charlie Davis, author and prominent fisherman. "At the Huntington 
Beach Flats area, and at the San Onofre kelp. And in the spring . . . you could 
bank on a run of fish at Catalina every spring." 
</P>
<P>
However, that was in the late 1950s and early '60s. Since then, the species has 
fallen victim to fishing pressure from gill-netters, to the decline of 
California's kelp habitat and to pollution in local waters. 
</P>
<P>
But skippers and landing operators are calling this spring and early summer one 
of the better seasons in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been one of the best years we've had in over 10 years, or 15, and the 
longest," said Ray Province, manager of L.A. Harbor Sportfishing in San Pedro. 
"Usually for sea bass, it's one or two days and they're gone. We had sea bass 
counts here for 10 days or so, and on every day we had a count. And they're 
bigger fish this year. Last year, if you got a sea bass 18 pounds or so, why 
you had something to brag about. Now they're bringing 40- or 50-pound fish in." 
</P>
<P>
Gary Norby, a skipper with 20 years' experience, was one of the first to locate 
a large school of sea bass earlier this month off Santa Catalina Island. The 
passengers aboard his boat, the Outer Limits, had caught their limits by 7:30 
a.m. "They were the biggest fish I have seen since 1974, when I had a similar 
bite in the same area," Norby said. 
</P>
<P>
Included in some of the catches off Santa Rosa have been giant sea bass -- a 
threatened species often referred to as black sea bass -- weighing up to 200 
pounds. And though they have had to be released, their fairly regular showing 
would appear to point to their revival. 
</P>
<P>
Still, biologists are quick to point out that it would be premature to start 
calling the white sea bass' recent resurgence a "comeback," and some say the 
successful season merely coincides with the abundance of squid making their way 
into Southland waters this year. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the main reason there's been such a good bite in the last several 
days," said Dave Ono, a Department of Fish and Game biologist based in Santa 
Barbara. "It's the fact that their favorite food (squid) is really concentrated 
out there. And I guess if the purse seiners were taking a lot of squid, it 
would affect the bite." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Read, a fisheries biologist based in San Diego, has been keeping track of 
sport catches of white sea bass for several years and said there is nothing 
special about this season in comparison with others. 
</P>
<P>
"That's kind of typical of the last few years that we've looked at it," he 
said. "You'll have a big bite in one area, for maybe two or three weeks, then 
it disappears, then they'll pick it up somewhere else. I don't think anybody at 
this time knows whether white sea bass are coming back strongly. They're in an 
area for a short time, then they disappear. Then they'll show up somewhere 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, nevertheless delighted by the excitement the white sea bass have 
generated throughout the sportfishing community this season, put the phenomenon 
in perspective: "I think it's one of those cyclical things. Finally, Mother 
Nature stepped in and gave us a heckuva batch of fish."

FISHING REPORT: CATFISH ARE BIG DEAL AT IRVINE LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fishermen trying to beat the summer heat are doing so at night at Irvine Lake, 
where catfish have become the main attraction. 
</P>
<P>
The lake is scheduled for the stocking of more than 1,000 pounds of catfish by 
July 4, but the whiskerfish are already providing some anglers with more than 
they can handle. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Iverson of Huntington Beach managed to catch the biggest catfish of the 
season, a 31-pounder that grabbed a large chunk of mackerel he was using for 
bait. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman at the lake, which is open from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m., said several 
fishermen have reported being broken off by catfish they couldn't turn or pull 
out of the weeds on their light line. A long-handled net and 20-pound test is 
recommended. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE MEAD -- Striped bass active in lower basin, most fish small but some to 
six pounds. Larger fish biting at 45 feet. Anchovies best bet. Catfish active 
but small, averaging less than two pounds, biting mainly at night in coves. 
Daytime temperatures near 120 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
BULLHEAD CITY -- Striped bass active in river, biting on anchovies, averaging 
between two and six pounds. Trout bite fair in river, mainly on Power Bait. 
Catfish between two and four pounds biting in coves. Best at night. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CACHUMA -- Trout active at 30-40 feet, mainly at Johnson Bay and dam. 
Trollers using six colors and needlefish lures. Catfish biting in shallows on 
mackerel. Largemouth bass slow. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CASITAS -- Largemouth bass active at 10-15 feet, some taken on surface at 
dawn. Russ Thomas, Lancaster, 10-pound bass, caught in Station Canyon on 
crawfish. Mike Mochizuki, West Los Angeles, seven and nine-pound bass. Catfish 
in shallows. Jim Hollis, Oak View, 18-pound catfish, caught on mackerel at 
three feet. Mike Payne, Santa Paula, 11-pound catfish. Trout active at 40 feet. 
Trollers doing best, using six-colors and brass-colored needlefish. Bill Books, 
Ojai, three trout, two pounds apiece. Other species slow. 
</P>
<P>
PYRAMID LAKE -- Striped bass active near dam or channel. Anchovies best bet. 
David Kilby, Canoga Park, five-pound striper. Frank and Jan Dajmovic, 
Fullerton, two seven-pound stripers. Tim McQueen, Palmdale, two four-pound 
stripers. Catfish biting on anchovies and nightcrawlers, most active in marina. 
Bluegill active but small, biting on meal worms and small spinners throughout 
lake. Largemouth bass fishing fair, best in channel or around island. Trout 
slow. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE PIRU -- Trout providing most action, biting on surface. Trolling Rapalas, 
Kastmasters and needlefish at eight-nine colors with bikini needlefish. Face of 
dam and marked barrels best locations. Still, fishermen using nightcrawlers and 
Power Bait. Largemouth bass and catfish slow. Larry Skaggs, Lancaster, 
six-pound bass. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CASTAIC -- Largemouth bass active on lower lake shoreline, with plastic 
worms and nightcrawlers producing most fish. Upper lake yielding more bass, but 
most weighing less than four pounds. Mike Tevere, Canyon Country, fishing from 
shore on the lower lake, used a Hula Popper surface plug at 8 p.m. and caught 
eight and 10-pound largemouths. Bluegill most active on upper lake, with small 
meal worms and red worms working best. Crappie active on lower lake, with fish 
to 1 3/4 pounds biting on mini-jigs and meal worms. Trout and catfish slow. 
</P>
<P>
IRVINE LAKE -- Night-fishing for catfish on the rise. Fishing at 10 feet in 
coves near brush most productive. Craig Reed, Brea, two catfish, 15 1/2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
PUDDINGSTONE RESERVOIR -- Trout planted Tuesday, biting throughout lake in 
morning, moving into deep holes during day. Cheese-colored Power Bait best bet. 
Largemouth bass fishing fair. Steve Green, San Gabriel, 6 1/2-pound bass, taken 
on surface lure at south shore. Red ear perch and bluegills biting best on 
small meal worms and No. 10 hook. South and east shoreline best. Hal Sharp,

15 catfish, 37 pounds, caught on chicken livers. 
</P>
<P>
BISHOP AREA -- Crowley: Rainbow trout between three and five pounds active 
throughout lake. Floating nightcrawlers best bet. Brown trout and Sacramento 
perch becoming increasingly active. Pleasant Valley Reservoir fishermen doing 
best with nightcrawlers and Power Bait. Owens River productive for fly 
fishermen. Sabrina: Bishop Creek Canyon fishermen reporting excellent results, 
catching limits of rainbow trout, browns averaging two pounds and an occasional 
Eastern brook. Most baits and lures working. Shore fishing best in morning and 
evenings near spillway and inlets. Bring mosquito repellent. 
</P>
<P>
MAMMOTH LAKES -- Twin and Mary lakes most productive, as planted trophy-trout 
from Owens River Ranch are starting to bite. Power Bait and mosquito flies 
working best. 
</P>
<P>
JUNE LAKE LOOP -- Gull and Silver lakes providing most action, with red salmon 
eggs and floating cheese getting best results. Trollers using four-five colors 
and needlefish, Triple-Teasers or Rapalas. Fishermen at Rush Creek catching 
some limits, getting best results on worms and small lures. 
</P>
<P>
BRIDGEPORT AREA -- Fishing is described as excellent at most areas. Twin Lakes: 
all baits working, several limits of 12-inch rainbows. Bridgeport Reservoir: 
Rainbows to 4 1/2 pounds and browns to three pounds biting on flies, Rapalas, 
blades and nightcrawlers. Virginia Lakes: Good for pan-size rainbows, biting on 
bait, lures and flies. West Walker River: Several limits, coming mostly on wet 
and dry flies and small lures.

SOCKERS RECEIVE SCHEDULING CONCESSIONS, SIGN LEASE FOR 1990-91 
</P>

<P>
After receiving what amounts to scheduling carte blanche for next season, the 
Sockers signed a one-year lease renewal with the San Diego Sports Arena 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement came after several days of friction between Socker owner Ron 
Fowler and Harry Cooper, who operates the arena and two weeks ago purchased 
rights to an International Hockey League franchise that will play in San Diego 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Upset that another professional team might slice into his revenues by 
preventing the Sockers from obtaining enough weekend dates, Fowler said last 
week that he wouldn't post the $500,000 letter of credit for next season if his 
team did not get scheduling priority. The Sockers will have 24 regular-season 
home games in 1990-91, the hockey team 41. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper agreed to Fowler's terms and will wait for the Sockers to receive 
approval of their schedule from the MISL in late July before he submits his 
schedule request to the IHL. MISL Commissioner Earl Foreman helped by moving 
the league's schedule deadline up from early September, which gives Cooper time 
to meet the IHL deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Along with scheduling rights, Cooper also will let the Sockers retain their 
office space at the arena, which was originally to have been split between the 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
"We have dodged another bullet," said Fowler, whose team lost approximately 
$500,000 last season and narrowly avoided extinction after filing for Chapter 
11 protection in federal bankruptcy court in 1988. "The last two weeks have not 
been fun for anybody. I think we rallied the community on behalf of the 
Sockers." 
</P>
<P>
Fowler said he received numerous phone calls and letters of support from fans. 
His cause was also aided by several local politicians. Councilwoman Judy 
McCarty quizzed Cooper about the future of the Sockers on Tuesday at City Hall, 
when Cooper was granted a memorandum of understanding that clears a path for 
him to begin environmental impact studies for his proposed sports arena in 
Sorrento Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper responded: "I'm a soccer fan, and I will assure that the Sockers will 
have a schedule equal to or better than they had in the past year . . . They do 
get priority over hockey. I'm sure both hockey and soccer can co-exist in the 
arena." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, the past two weeks have been trying for Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so glad that I don't have to discuss the soccer situation anymore," he 
said. "It's just such a relief to know that I can concentrate on the hockey 
now." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers have the same lease as last season, when they paid a fee for each 
game based on attendance. Fowler said they will pay $10,000 for a crowd up to 
9,000, $11,000 for a crowd between 9,001 and 11,000 and $12,000 for a crowd 
above 11,000. The arena retains profits from parking and concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Before the IHL issue arose, Fowler asked that Cooper fund an additional $2,000 
in staffing costs per game. Fowler said he decided that wasn't feasible and 
agreed to withdraw his request in exchange for full use of office space. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler said the Sockers will now begin selling tickets and advertising space 
and negotiating on player contracts.

TRUMP GIVEN LAST-MINUTE BRIDGE LOAN; 
</P>
<P>
BAILOUT: THE $20 MILLION IN NEW FUNDS WILL GIVE THE DEVELOPER AND HIS REAL 
ESTATE AND GAMBLING EMPIRE BREATHING ROOM. BUT SOME QUESTION WHETHER HE WILL 
SURVIVE IN THE LONG RUN.

<P>
Developer Donald J. Trump narrowly sidestepped financial disaster Tuesday when 
he received a last-minute loan of $20 million that enabled him to make overdue 
payments on the bonds for Trump Castle, one of his three casino-hotels in 
Atlantic City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The payment was made less than seven hours before the midnight deadline and 
allowed Trump to avoid a formal default that could have triggered the collapse 
of his entire real estate and gambling empire. 
</P>
<P>
One official close to Trump said a default on the Trump Castle bonds could have 
set off defaults on his other bank loans and that could have sparked defaults 
on the bonds of his other two casinos, Trump Plaza and Taj Mahal. 
</P>
<P>
"He has dodged a bullet," the official said, "a major bullet." 
</P>
<P>
Trump confirmed the loan in a short statement, adding in a brief telephone 
interview: "I feel great. This is a great day for us." 
</P>
<P>
According to a high official in the New York-based Trump Organization, the 
$20-million loan is the first phase of a $65-million loan package that has been 
agreed to now by all of Trump's bankers. Trump has dozens of lenders who span 
the globe from New York to Frankfurt to Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Trump said: "I want to thank all of my banks and lending 
institutions for making this complex and highly technical agreement possible. I 
have gained a great and deep respect for the banking system and those who make 
it work." 
</P>
<P>
The payments on the Trump Castle bonds were made with the $20-million loan, 
which covered the interest payments, while Trump took care of the remaining 
principal payments, according to a spokesman for First Fidelity Bank in New 
Jersey, trustee for the bonds. Trump owed a total of $42.6 million in principal 
and interest. 
</P>
<P>
Seven East Coast banks lent Trump the $20 million, with the majority coming 
from Citibank and Bankers Trust in New York. The money amounts to a 30-day 
"bridge loan" being secured by Trump's personal assets, bankers said. 
</P>
<P>
The total loan package, which will provide Trump with another $45 million, is 
expected to be hammered out in the next few weeks and force Trump to hire a 
chief financial officer for his organization and make major cuts in his lavish 
lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
According to several news reports, Trump will be forced to live on $450,000 a 
month for the rest of the year, $375,000 a month in 1991 and $300,000 in 1992. 
Trump owns several homes, a fleet of airplanes and a $29-million yacht. 
</P>
<P>
The loan agreement is expected to give Trump breathing room to sell off some of 
his assets over the next several months. The lending agreement also calls for a 
restructuring of about $850 million in debt at lower interest rates and longer 
terms of maturity ranging up to five years. 
</P>
<P>
Trump has about $2 billion in bank debt and another $1.3 billion in debt on his 
publicly traded bonds. "I don't owe anybody anything," Trump bragged Tuesday. 
"It has all been paid." 
</P>
<P>
Trump's next major test may come in November when he must make another 
semi-annual interest payment on the bonds for the Taj Mahal, which opened in 
April and cost more than $1 billion to build. Trump raised $675 million at an 
interest rate of 14% to finish construction of the casino-hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"The Taj is a killer," noted one East Coast real estate expert, pointing out 
that the giant casino hotel is going to have great difficulty breaking even 
during the off season. Atlantic City's primary tourist season runs from May 
through September. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's events ended several weeks of marathon negotiations between Trump and 
his lenders over how he was going to restructure his finances. The talks came 
down to the 11th hour after two of his European lenders balked at a final 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Once the embodiment of 1980s nouveau riche, the 44-year-old Trump in recent 
weeks became an object lesson in the hazards of debt financing. His real estate 
and gambling empire took more than 10 years to build but nearly unraveled in 
less than 10 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Though he owns quality properties, Trump was hurt because he borrowed too much 
and, in some cases, paid too much for his assets, financial experts said. In 
the end, like any overburdened property owner, he simply did not have the cash 
to make the interest payments on his debts. 
</P>
<P>
His problems came to a head after he was unable to sell or refinance his 
properties in the depressed markets of Manhattan and Atlantic City, where most 
of his wealth is concentrated. Initial news reports in April that questioned 
Trump's financial condition turned into a torrent of publicity in May and June 
about his worsening problems. 
</P>
<P>
Trump was pictured as beseeching his bankers for more money, an image that had 
the ring of truth when Trump skipped the $42.6-million payment on the Trump 
Castle bonds on June 15. 
</P>
<P>
Trump sounded bitter about the publicity, though, saying he was being unfairly 
singled out when real estate developers all over the country are having 
problems making interest payments on their loans. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, this was a media-driven event," he said, referring to the marathon 
negotiations. "It has been disgraceful." 
</P>
<P>
Though Trump has survived in the short term, he faces the prospect of shedding 
his real estate properties and other assets in a depressed market during the 
next few months. Many real estate experts on the East Coast question whether he 
is going to survive in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
Trump's assets range from the casino-hotels in Atlantic City to elegant 
commercial buildings in Manhattan to abandoned railroad yards on the Upper West 
Side of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
One official who works for Trump said the developer might be wise to unload 
Trump Plaza, which he said should sell for at least $500 million and generate a 
profit of $70 million or more. The casino-hotel has been one of the most 
profitable in Atlantic City in recent years.

MANY OIL FIRMS HAD GIVEN UP ON OFFSHORE PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oil companies scrambled Tuesday to assess the damage that they might suffer 
from President Bush's sweeping decision to delay offshore drilling, but many 
had already given up hope of tapping any time soon what are believed to be 
massive underwater reserves. 
</P>
<P>
Although oil companies publicly expressed disappointment at the President's 
decision to make many offshore areas off-limits for most of the decade, 
industry officials privately admitted that many oil companies had already 
placed offshore plans on the back burner. 
</P>
<P>
"Chevron probably would not show up tomorrow if there was a lease sale," one 
industry insider said. 
</P>
<P>
The reason: Regulatory delays, falling crude prices and endless court 
challenges have threatened to turn offshore production into an unprofitable 
proposition. Many companies are exploring for oil abroad, where environmental 
restrictions are less rigorous. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said Tuesday that he will delay most future sales of leases in waters off 
the Pacific Northwest, California and Florida until after the turn of the 
century, to allow more environmental study. An exception is 87 tracts off 
Southern California, which may go on sale after 1996. 
</P>
<P>
In a federal lease sale, companies bid for the right to explore for oil on the 
outer continental shelf, three miles beyond the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
The President's decision would apparently not affect oil exploration and 
production projects on parcels already leased off the coast of California, 
where platforms are producing about 80,000 barrels a day. The decision also 
leaves open the question of offshore exploration in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials still believe that untapped reservoirs off U.S. coasts hold 
billions of gallons of oil and trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. Until 
recently, most major companies were hoping to bid on leases off Northern and 
Southern California to get at some of that oil. 
</P>
<P>
The industry's main trade group, the American Petroleum Institute, argued that 
Bush's decision will accelerate the drop in domestic oil production, lead to 
greater reliance on imports and oil tanker shipments, and result in the flight 
of U.S. capital and technology to foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
That notwithstanding, oil companies have already made plans that don't include 
underwater projects. They are aware that public sentiment is against opening 
more offshore areas in the wake of last year's oil spills -- most notably that 
from the tanker Exxon Valdez in Alaska's Prince William Sound. 
</P>
<P>
The companies "long ago put aside plans to put together bids," said Carl 
Schmid, spokesman for the National Ocean Industries Assn., a trade group of 
offshore operators. 
</P>
<P>
Unocal Corp., which has sizable holdings off California's coast, has spent 
virtually nothing the past couple of years to prepare for future sales of 
offshore leases, spokesman Arthur H. Bentley said. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the industry's reluctance to pursue offshore drilling: A 
lease sale is only the first step in an arduous process that may or may not 
result in oil production -- and profits. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron Corp. has lead a consortium of 18 oil firms that have struggled 
unsuccessfully for 10 years to launch production from the $2-billion Point 
Arguello project. It has become a symbol of industry frustration over trying to 
produce oil during environmentally sensitive times. Despite the time and money, 
the project has yet to produce a drop of oil. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Chevron wrote off $445 million of its $800-million investment in the 
massive project off the coast of Santa Barbara County -- an acknowledgement 
that, even if the project goes forward, it is unlikely to repay its costs. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the California Coastal Commission has objected on air-quality 
grounds to federal government permits granted to Chevron and Conoco for the 
drilling of exploratory wells on two leases off the coast of Ventura and Santa 
Barbara counties. They are believed to be the most recent requests for 
exploratory drilling off California's coast. The companies are appealing. 
</P>
<P>
For some oil firms, the only real effect of Bush's decision will be the outcome 
of projects involving leases off the coasts of New England and Florida that 
have already been paid for. 
</P>
<P>
The President ordered cancellation of existing leases in the Georges Bank area 
off New England and directed Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. to begin 
studying a possible buyback and cancellation of existing leases off Florida. 
The government has already sold 73 leases off Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Bentley said Unocal was still not sure how Bush's announcement will affect it. 
It has invested more than $20 million in leases off the Florida coast. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil Corp. estimated that it has spent $33.2 million on leases in the same 
area. "Clearly we are impacted by the President's decision," Mobil spokesman 
John Lord said.

GM Explores Czechoslovakian Venture: General Motors said it is developing plans 
with Czechoslovakia's government to build up to 250,000 automobile 
transmissions a year there for export to GM assembly plants throughout Europe. 
GM said the transmissions would be destined for its Opel Vauxhall cars and 
would help satisfy a projected shortage of the components during the next few 
years. Transmission manufacturing could begin about 18 to 24 months after any 
agreement is reached.

Room With View: New, cheaper technology is making video conferences more 
attractive than travel, especially for intra-company meetings. The price of a 
basic installation has been halved to about $50,000. Companies with private 
video conference rooms include Texas Instruments, General Dynamics and Arco Oil 
&amp; Gas. US Sprint and other companies rent teleconferencing rooms, enabling 
small firms to use the technology without a capital investment. Dallas Business

Faring Well: Between the strike at Greyhound and high summer gas prices, record 
numbers of Americans are riding the rails. Amtrak reports that ridership is up 
12% over last year's 22 million, with scenic routes pulling in increases of 30% 
and up. An Amtrak spokesman said that with more cars on its scenic routes, 
Amtrak could triple its ridership in the summer. Denver Post

H-P'S PUETTE TO HEAD APPLE'S U.S. SALES UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Apple Computer Inc. has completed a six-month shake-up of its top-level 
management with the appointment of longtime Hewlett-Packard executive Robert 
Puette as head of U.S. sales and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Puette, 48, was named president of Apple USA, a position left vacant by the 
resignation of Allan Z. Loren in January. 
</P>
<P>
He reports to Michael Spindler, who was named chief operating officer when 
Loren resigned. 
</P>
<P>
During a 24-year career at Hewlett-Packard Co., Puette piloted the company's 
personal computer business from a start-up to an industry leader. His most 
recent title was general manager of the personal computer group. 
</P>
<P>
Puette steps into one of the hottest seats at Apple. In the first six months of 
its current fiscal year, the personal computer maker's U.S. sales declined 2% 
while international sales surged. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic sales in the second quarter accounted for just 53% of Apple's $1.35 
billion in revenue, compared to 60% in the same quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have faulted the company for failing to meet increased competition from 
makers of low-cost IBM-compatible personal computers. While Apple's prices 
remain relatively high, makers of less expensive machines have adopted many of 
the ease-of-use features that fueled the original popularity of the Apple 
Macintosh computer. 
</P>
<P>
After Spindler's appointment, Apple Chairman and Chief Executive John Sculley 
took charge of new product development. Jean-Louis Gassee, president of Apple 
Products, resigned.

CHRYSLER TO PURCHASE NO. 4 DOLLAR RENT A CAR; 
</P>

RENTALS: THE BUYOUT OF THE PRIVATELY HELD, LOS ANGELES-BASED CAR LEASING FIRM 
CONTINUES A TREND OF AUTO MAKERS BUYING INTO SUCH COMPANIES TO OBTAIN CAPTIVE 
MARKETS FOR THEIR VEHICLES.

Chrysler Corp. agreed Tuesday to buy Los Angeles-based Dollar Rent A Car, the 
nation's largest privately owned auto rental company and the fourth largest 
overall. 
</P>
<P>
Neither company would disclose the purchase price. When it was reported earlier 
this month that the two were talking, one source said the price would be $70 
million to $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
But Dollar founder Henry J. Caruso said in a telephone interview Tuesday that 
such estimates were "way off base." He would not say whether the price was more 
or less than the estimated range. 
</P>
<P>
Caruso said that the firm's 500-member headquarters staff will remain in Los 
Angeles and that he will stay on as a consultant. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to continue to be active," he said. "I will not be as close to the 
day-to-day operations as I have been in the past. But I intend to offer what I 
can from my past experiences in the growth of this company and from my 
marketing experiences." 
</P>
<P>
The transaction, scheduled to be completed Aug. 15, follows a trend in which 
auto makers have turned the rental industry into a distribution system for 
their products. Rental companies are the leading buyers of cars. 
</P>
<P>
Owning a rental company also gives manufacturers a means of letting prospective 
buyers sample their products in hopes that they will purchase them. "It gives 
an auto manufacturer the ability to offer the consumer an experience he would 
not get otherwise," said Thomas F. O'Grady, president of New York-based 
Automotive Resources, a market research firm. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate development Monday, Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America, in 
Cypress, completed its acquisition of a majority investment in Value Rent-A-Car 
Inc. of Deerfield, Fla. It was said to be the first purchase of a car rental 
company by an automotive importer. 
</P>
<P>
Value has about 25 locations in Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Arizona, Colorado 
and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
Among American manufacturers, Ford Motor owns a portion of Hertz, the nation's 
largest rental company, and has also invested in Budget Rent A Car Corp. 
General Motors owns part of National Car Rental System and Avis Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler bought Thrifty Rent-A-Car last July for $263 million and, five days 
later, Thrifty bought Snappy Car Rental for $40 million. Dollar and the other 
two rental firms will operate as separate entities under a Tulsa, Okla.-based 
subsidiary of Chrysler, Pentastar Transportation Group. 
</P>
<P>
Dollar, which buys 70,000 to 80,000 cars annually, has used General Motors cars 
primarily. 
</P>
<P>
"When you get volume orders like those from a rental company," said Chrysler 
spokesman Tom Jakobowski, "it gives you more solid production. It keeps your 
plants in operation, and that translates into quality." 
</P>
<P>
But owning a rental car company doesn't guarantee that a subsidiary will buy 
all its cars from its parent. Thrifty earlier this year bought about 4,000 
autos from Mitsubishi, even though Thrifty is owned by Chrysler, because the 
cars were less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
Dollar, which has 762 rental locations in the United States and 550 overseas, 
is primarily a franchising company. It owns only about about 18 of its 
locations, including ones in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Burbank, Ontario and 
Detroit. It has a fleet of 82,000 vehicles, 57,000 in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of Dollar's locations are on airport property, most Thrifty 
counters are just outside airports. Snappy specializes in renting cars to 
people whose autos are being repaired. Caruso founded Dollar Rent A Car in 1966 
as Dollar A Day. It had a fleet of 18 Volkswagens operating from one location 
in downtown Los Angeles. Within a year, he had opened another five branches in 
Los Angeles, and the company began selling franchises nationwide.

PICKENS DUCKS GREENMAIL QUESTION; 
</P>
<P>
JAPAN: THE AMERICAN INVESTOR COUNTERCHARGES THAT KOITO MANUFACTURING IS 
CONSPIRING WITH TOYOTA TO DENY HIM A SEAT ON THE AUTO PARTS MAKER'S BOARD.

<P>
American investor T. Boone Pickens Jr. said Tuesday that he will continue his 
fight against Japanese "cartels" but declined to answer a charge that he is 
acting as an agent for a Japanese greenmailer. 
</P>
<P>
Talking with foreign reporters, Pickens said Koito Manufacturing Co. -- an auto 
parts maker in which he owns the largest block of shares, 26% -- is colluding 
with Toyota, its second-largest shareholder, to deny him representation on 
Koito's board. 
</P>
<P>
However, Pickens refused to respond to Koito's charge that he is collaborating 
with a Japanese who has been accused of trying to harass Koito into buying back 
Pickens' shares at an inflated price -- a practice known as greenmail. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he could say he had no continuing relationship with Kitaro 
Watanabe, an auto dealer from whom Pickens acquired the shares, he replied: 
</P>
<P>
"We bought the stock from Mr. Watanabe, and we paid for the stock. That is 
really as far as I will go on answering those questions because, again, we get 
back into a private company that I just somehow don't think it would be to my 
advantage to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
"We've made all the disclosures under Japanese law that are required. So I 
don't see any reason to expand beyond what we've been required to do." 
</P>
<P>
Koito has charged that Watanabe twice tried to greenmail Koito before passing 
his shares to Pickens. In April, Watanabe was fined for failing to report to 
the Finance Ministry his accumulation of more than 10% of Koito's stock, as 
required by law. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens, who with 52 other Americans plans to attend a Koito stockholders 
meeting Thursday, charged that Toyota was manipulating the price of auto parts 
bought from Koito to inflate Toyota's profits at Koito's expense. Although 
Koito's revenue has increased every year for the past three years, he said, its 
profit has fallen, while Toyota's has continued to rise. 
</P>
<P>
"A keiretsu (business group) is a cartel," Pickens said. "Whatever you call it 
-- a cartel, a trust, a monopoly, a keiretsu or a zaibatsu -- it's wrong. Any 
economic system that benefits a few at the expense of many is wrong and will 
ultimately fail." 
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that he had received proxies from Japanese who hold nearly 2.3 
million shares of Koito stock. The proxies, he said, represent only 1.4% of the 
shares outstanding but 57% of the estimated number of small Japanese 
shareholders in Koito. 
</P>
<P>
"This is clear evidence that the average Japanese investor is dissatisfied with 
the keiretsu system in Japan," Pickens said. "Many of the proxy cards we have 
received say that 'Toyota's piracy has to stop.' " 
</P>
<P>
He said he is "not deterred by the stonewalling tactics of Koito and Toyota" 
and added that he intends to come back for the Koito stockholders meeting "next 
year and again the following year." 
</P>
<P>
Pickens also said he intends to raise his holdings in Koito soon -- to at least 
a third of the total. 
</P>
<P>
He said top executives of Koito and Toyota, as well as leaders of the powerful 
Federation of Economic Organizations, have refused to meet with him. However, 
he said, Koito has agreed to let him tour its plant Friday.

United Airlines has asked the federal government for approval to serve Madrid 
and Manchester, England, from its hub at Washington Dulles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
United said it would provide daily service on each route, using Boeing 
767-200ER aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
Chairman Stephen M. Wolf said the applications were part of a United strategy 
to become "a truly global airline in the 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
He said United's hub at Dulles, in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, would 
permit Madrid and Manchester passengers to connect with United flights to 55 
other cities in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In Europe, he said, United's strategy is to concentrate service on primary 
transportation centers in France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom and to 
expand to other European cities as opportunities arise and new aircraft become 
available. 
</P>
<P>
Berlin, Warsaw, Moscow and Milan/Rome also are on United's list of cities to be 
served, Wolf said. 
</P>

United also has been expanding aggressively in the Pacific.

U.S.-JAPAN TRADE TALKS MAKE PROGRESS, GO INTO EXTRA DAY

U.S. and Japanese officials began an unscheduled third day of talks today in 
hopes of completing a final report on the results of yearlong negotiations 
aimed at removing trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
Officials on both sides could not say when they might finish with the so-called 
Structural Impediments Initiative, which President Bush has made the 
centerpiece of his economic policy toward Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to say whether we will finish these talks" today, one U.S. 
official said. "We could finish while we are here in Tokyo, or we could finish 
later next week." 
</P>
<P>
Only 24 hours earlier, a U.S. official had said the sides were "not far apart." 
But on Sunday, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills was quoted as 
saying in Washington that another round of negotiations might be needed. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the U.S. delegation here appeared to discount this possibility. He 
cited as areas of "good progress" Japan's promise to untangle its complicated 
goods-distribution system -- a key U.S. demand -- and a U.S. promise to reduce 
its budget deficit, something on which the Japanese have insisted. 
</P>
<P>
Differences remain on a U.S. demand for more Japanese public works spending and 
on how the sides will fulfill reform promises. 
</P>
<P>
Discussions that began at 9 a.m. Tuesday and continued into the night focused 
on Japan's call for a reduction in the U.S. budget deficit. The Americans 
responded, one official said, by explaining that Bush plans to use a surplus in 
Social Security funds to lower the deficit and will try to revise the 
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act to require budget surpluses after 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, he said, will stand by a pledge that it made in an April 
interim report to eliminate its budget deficit by 1993.

MEASURING SYSTEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A. C. Nielsen Co. has had an effective monopoly in measuring national TV 
audiences, but it does compete with Arbitron Ratings Co. in measuring local TV 
stations. The main systems of measurement are: 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen Television Index. This system, started in 1987, consists of 4,000 
people meters in homes around the country. The people meter records information 
supplied by viewers on who is watching which program; it then delivers that 
data the next day to the network and advertiser. A household stays in the 
sample an average of two years. 
</P>
<P>
Nielsen Station Index. NSI measures local television viewing by two methods. 
The first, which uses about 400 meters on TV sets in each of 24 markets, simply 
reports which channel is turned on. A set meter stays in a home for five years. 
The second method, which collects information about who is watching specific 
programs, uses 200,000 diaries sent out four times a year to 211 markets. The 
quarterly diary measurements are commonly known as "the sweeps." 
</P>
<P>
Arbitron Local Market Report. This system, operated by Arbitron Ratings Co., 
competes with Nielsen in the measurement of local TV stations. Like Nielsen's 
NSI, Arbitron collects its information from both set meters in 13 markets and 
100,000 diaries sent to 209 markets as least four times annually. 
</P>
<P>
Arbitron ScanAmerica. This system, currently operating in 600 homes in Denver, 
is Arbitron's plan to compete with Nielsen in the national ratings game. Based 
on people meter technology, the system also seeks to trace product purchasing 
habits with TV viewing. Arbitron is two years into a five-year, $125-million 
plan to put ScanAmerica into 5,000 homes by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Pergamon AGB. The British ratings company lost $67 million when it first tried 
to introduce its people meter in the United States in 1987-88. Now owned by 
Robert Maxwell, AGB hopes to exploit the current uncertainty surrounding 
Nielsen to stage a comeback. Network executives who have met with AGB 
representatives said the company has offered few specific ideas about its 
plans. JOHN LIPPMAN

CONTINENTAL BANK TO REVAMP, CUT 900 JOBS

<P>
Continental Bank Corp. said Tuesday that it would cut 900 jobs and certain 
services, redrawing parts of a battle plan formulated by Chairman Thomas C. 
Theobald after a 1984 federal bailout. 
</P>
<P>
After undergoing the largest bank bailout in U.S. history, Continental has 
focused on sophisticated corporate and institutional banking, downplaying the 
traditional consumer. 
</P>
<P>
It maintains that its restructuring is not a change in basic strategy but a 
realignment of services with changing customer demands. 
</P>
<P>
However, it is retrenching from a roughly three-year expansion into several 
specialized areas, particularly global trading services. About 60% of the job 
cuts will be from that segment. 
</P>
<P>
The bank holding company, with assets of $31.3 billion, said it will set aside 
$50 million to cover costs of the cuts. As a result, it expects to post an 
unspecified second-quarter loss. 
</P>
<P>
While analysts viewed the job and product reductions as essential to reducing 
expenses, they said the retraction may not be enough to improve the bank's 
profit performance this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly expected something greater than 900 people," said County NatWest 
USA analyst Stephen Berman. "I don't know whether it's enough."

Several hundred guests paid as much as $250 each to attend a pre-show reception 
and after-show party, where they sampled Thai food provided by Tommy Tang's. It 
was an informal event in the best sense of the term -- well organized but 
casual -- and the comedians kept things light. 
</P>
<P>
Belzer, a survivor of testicular cancer, emceed the evening, which included 
performances by comedians Bob Saget, Bobby Slayton, Kevin Pollak and Charles 
Fleischer. Said Saget before the show: "You get a real Peter Pan feeling 
performing at things like this, if that's not stupid." 
</P>
<P>
According to Cancervive founder Susan Nessin, the group differs from other 
cancer support groups in that members must be recovered and out of treatment 
for at least six months. Cancervive focuses on life after treatment, with an 
emphasis on reentering the mainstream of society. The group also tries to 
educate the public about the difficulties of trying to overcome cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The show opened with a performance by the Tom Scott Orchestra (the 
jazz-oriented house band on the late Pat Sajak Show), with a musical number by 
the singer Shondra, who performed a new song, "We Can Survive." 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Lansing also presented Cancervive's first Victory Award to actress Lee 
Remick in recognition of her recovery from cancer. Accepting the award, Remick 
said: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm deeply honored to receive this, and I'm thrilled that I qualify." 
</P>
<P>
It was a sentiment with which many in the audience could identify.

<P>
TRAVEL: BUDGET-MINDED MAKE WORLDWIDE DELIVERIES FOR COURIER AND TRANSPORT 
COMPANIES TO HELP CUT VACATION COSTS.

<P>
Looking for ways to save money on that vacation? Serve as a courier and go 
overseas for a pittance. Or hire on with a car transport agency and drive 
cross-country for next-to-nothing. 
</P>
<P>
More and more budget-minded consumers are discovering that the proliferating 
overnight-mail market can offer them low, sometimes downright cheap, air fares 
to many international cities -- and a few domestic spots -- if they will serve 
as a courier for cargo or document shipments. For example, how about $300 for a 
round-trip fare to Singapore that normally costs $1,400? 
</P>
<P>
Stateside, if you prefer to drive, auto transport companies may be the ticket, 
possibly even for a trip in a luxury vehicle like a Jaguar or a Mercedes. For 
deposits ranging from $100 to $250, depending on the agency, you can deliver 
someone else's car to most major cities nationwide and see the sights. You'll 
drive mostly newer models. The transport firm gives you the first tank of gas 
free, though you'll pay the expenses thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
What's your price for this inexpensive travel? You will have to bend your 
vacation timetable to match that of the courier or car-transport firms. You may 
be required to leave on short notice or alter your schedule if the company 
suddenly postpones your trip. (You'll usually be rescheduled to travel in that 
same week.) 
</P>
<P>
"The No. 1 thing passengers interested in being couriers should ask themselves 
is, 'How flexible are they?' " said Dan Rosendahl, owner of Way-To-Go! travel 
services in Los Angeles, a firm specializing in booking courier flights, air 
charters and standby seats. "The second thing they should ask is, 'Is the 
(fare) savings worth the restrictions?' " 
</P>
<P>
Prospective couriers also should ask about fine print, Rosendahl advised, 
explaining: "There are general types of restrictions. No pre-seating, no 
special meals, or transferable tickets." 
</P>
<P>
Valid passports are a must, of course; most firms require that couriers be at 
least 21 years old and have a clean and conservative appearance; some firms bar 
them from drinking alcohol before or during flights. 
</P>
<P>
Couriers, generally, must travel solo, although some firms will help schedule a 
traveling companion on another flight the same or next day. Couriers get their 
tickets by meeting an agent, usually at the airport a few hours before their 
flights depart. 
</P>
<P>
Courier fares vary by season, reflecting regular ticket costs; the savings are 
greatest during off-season. 
</P>
<P>
Being a free-lance or "casual" courier usually doesn't mean much hard work. 
Most couriers don't even have to lug a package in exchange for their fares, 
usually half- or a third-off regular ticket prices. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are exceptions, said Sherri Dahl, of IBC Pacific Inc., a 
wholesaler of courier seats. In Taipei and Seoul, she said, customs agents 
require couriers to personally escort baggage through. 
</P>
<P>
Be sure to ask if a firm charges a deposit for your trip. IBC, for example, 
requires "casual couriers" to deposit $500 before booking a flight; the money 
is returned when the passenger returns. Other courier firms charge $100 to $300 
in deposits, which are returned at the destination or on stateside return. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the time you'll have to lug your own bags on the plane since the 
courier company is using your baggage space for its shipment. This ensures that 
their cargo is loaded immediately and is processed through customs faster than 
it would be if shipped by air freight. 
</P>
<P>
"Some airlines will allow the courier to check one or two bags" besides the 
firm's shipment, said Jo Mabey of Excalibur International Courier Inc., which 
contracts with Way-To-Go! for couriers. "Or (couriers) can always pay extra for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Sachit Shah of Los Angeles, discovered another benefit to courier 
work on his initial travel this way. He met Mabey at TWA's counter and received 
his ticket to London, bypassing the regular, international passengers waiting 
to check in. In minutes, he was handed instructions to go to the London airport 
courier office, then was dispatched to the passenger waiting lounge. 
</P>
<P>
Why did he seek courier work? "I found an ad for this in the newspaper, so I 
thought I'd try it," he explained, adding he "saved around $150" on the regular 
round-trip fare to London, which at present, tourist-season peak is about $840. 
</P>
<P>
Prospective couriers should know there are other wrinkles to the work: They may 
accompany shipments one-way or round-trip; they may go for one or two weeks, 30 
days or on an open-ended ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Most firms book two months ahead and currently have little or nothing left for 
July for popular spots like London. But they do have cancellations, so if you 
are ready to fly at the last minute, keep calling. 
</P>
<P>
"We sign up people who can go at the last minute, and they'll get a really 
low-cost fare or free," said Rosendahl. "We just had a recent last-minute to 
Singapore for $150 round-trip." 
</P>
<P>
He does not charge registration fees for booking low-cost flights. But he has 
set up a separate travel club for $75 a year; members can get $50 to $100 more 
off on their flights, he said, adding that charge is worth it only "If you 
travel more than once a year. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Some agents charge to book courier flights. Now Voyager, a large New York 
agency, for example, charges a $50 membership fee. 
</P>
<P>
The motor-minded -- those interested in driving a car, van or truck across 
country -- should know that most firms will not take reservations more than one 
week in advance of departure. 
</P>
<P>
From Los Angeles, drive-away agencies report, the most popular destinations are 
New York and Florida; those bookings should be relatively easy. But drivers 
beware: Most drive-away firms will not take personal checks for the 
$100-to-$250 deposit they may require. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on company rules, drivers get specified time spans to get to a 
destination. Auto Driveaway Co. in Los Angeles gives drivers eight days to New 
York and Miami; nine days to Boston; four days to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
"The time is based on driving about 400 miles a day, about eight hours each 
day," said Jean Moen of the Wilshire Boulevard firm, which has been in business 
since 1952 and has 90 offices in the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Moen said her firm requires drivers, who are fingerprinted and photographed, 
to: hold valid licenses; be 21 years old, although some other agencies will 
hire 19-year-olds; and provide references here and at the destination. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people do this," Moen said. "They like driving one way, then flying 
back. And we get a lot of international travelers now, too. It's a reasonable 
way for them to get across the country and to see something of it." 
</P>
<P>
She said her firm urges owners of older-model vehicles to ship them by truck, 
meaning drive-away motorists mostly deal with newer, nicer cars. "But we get 
all kinds," she said, adding, "We had a Lamborghini the other day."

YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND: WOMEN AND MEN IN CONVERSATION by Deborah Tannen 
William Morrow and Co. $18.95, 331 pages 
</P>
<P>
He: I'm really tired. I didn't sleep well last night. 
</P>
<P>
 She: I didn't sleep well either. I never do. 
</P>
<P>
 He: Why are you trying to belittle me? 
</P>
<P>
Another skirmish in the battle of the sexes? A relationship doomed to failure? 
Or is something more subtle going on here? According to Deborah Tannen in "You 
Just Don't Understand," the sparks that fly from the exchange of a few words 
can be explained by the fundamental differences in the way women and men 
express themselves. "She" is saying: "I know how you feel; I feel the same 
way." "He" sees it as a put-down. 
</P>
<P>
Tannen has a marvelous ear for the way real people express themselves, and a 
scientist's command of the inner structures of speech and human relationship. 
In "You Just Don't Understand," she suggests that men and women are speaking to 
each other in different languages without realizing it. Thus, the risk of 
misunderstanding is enormous -- and potentially catastrophic. 
</P>
<P>
"There are gender differences in ways of speaking, and we need to identify and 
understand them," Tannen explains. "Without such understanding, we are doomed 
to blame each other or ourselves -- or the relationship -- for the otherwise 
mystifying and damaging effects of our contrasting conversational styles." 
</P>
<P>
At least one of the obstacles to communication between men and women, Tannen 
writes, is the difference in the way men and women perceive the world -- a 
difference that begins in early childhood and is reinforced throughout life. A 
man sees himself as "an individual in a hierarchical social order in which he 
(is) either one-up or one-down," Tannen argues. A woman sees herself as "an 
individual in a network of connections." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Tannen explains, a man regards conversations as "negotiations in 
which people try to achieve and maintain the upper hand," while a woman is more 
likely to see conversations as "negotiations for closeness in which people try 
to seek and give confirmation and support." When a man and a woman try to talk 
to each other, they are often talking at cross-purposes; the danger is that the 
man will be perceived by the woman as overbearing and insensitive, and the 
woman will be perceived by the man as nagging and manipulative. 
</P>
<P>
Tannen has coined a number of words and phrases (or borrowed them from the 
scientific literature) to show us exactly what she means. Thus, for example, 
she urges us to look for the "metamessage" beneath the surface of an otherwise 
ordinary encounter: "That is," she explains, "information about the relations 
among the people involved, and their attitudes toward what they are saying or 
doing, and the people they are saying or doing it to." 
</P>
<P>
For example, Tannen suggests men are less likely than women to ask for 
directions, or, having been asked, to admit they don't know. That's because the 
"metamessage" in a request for information is perceived by men as a matter of 
status: "The one who has more information is framed as higher up on the 
ladder." 
</P>
<P>
The same mechanism is at work, she says, when the wife wants to chat and the 
husband wants to read the newspaper. A woman, for whom "talk is the glue that 
holds relationships together," seeks "rapport-talk," while a man is content 
with "report-talk" because his relationships are held together by "activities . 
. . or talk about activities." 
</P>
<P>
But Tannen insists that we can learn to avoid these dangers of miscommunication 
simply by recognizing and understanding them: "Realizing that men and women 
have different assumptions about the place of talk in relationships, a woman 
can observe a man's desire to read the morning paper at the breakfast table 
without interpreting it as a rejection of her," Tannen writes. "And a man can 
understand a woman's desire for talk without interpeting it as an unreasonable 
demand or a manipulative attempt to prevent him from doing what he wants to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Tannen, a "sociolinguist" and a professor at Georgetown University, has applied 
the tools of scientific research to the ordinary encounters of men and women in 
everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
But there is nothing stuffy about "You Just Don't Understand." Quite to the 
contrary, it is a chatty, earnest and endearing book that promises here-and-now 
rewards for taking the trouble to listen more carefully to what others are 
saying -- and to be more sensitive to what others are hearing.

DR. NEIL SOLOMON: VERY LOW-CALORIE DIET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: It seems that I've been trying to lose weight all my life but I 
haven't had much luck with the usual diet. I believe that I could stick to 
almost any kind of diet, no matter how unpleasant, if I knew it would only last 
a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
I understand there's a very low-calorie diet that could bring about a 
substantial loss of weight within a short period of time. Is there any reason 
from a medical standpoint that such a diet would not be advisable? I should add 
that being heavy isn't advisable either. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Very low-calorie diets may have serious short- and long-term health 
consequences. Short-term risks include dehydration and cramps; long-term risks 
include cardiac problems. 
</P>
<P>
Very low-calorie diets should be used only by people who are severely 
overweight and only under medical supervision. I strongly advise that you speak 
with your physician before undertaking such a diet on your own. You might want 
to ask him to recommend a safe and effective diet supplement.

JAVELIN POINTING WAY TO CLARKE'S SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
HEPTATHLON: VALLEY COLLEGE STAR FINDS HER SCORES TAKING OFF ON EVE OF TAC 
JUNIOR MEET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Melanie Clarke competed in the long jump, triple jump, shotput, high jump and 
sprints at El Camino Real High, but not the javelin, which is not contested in 
interscholastic competition in California. 
</P>
<P>
She took up the heptathlon as a freshman at Valley College in the spring and 
demonstrated instant success in all seven events except one -- the javelin. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, however, has shown steady improvement in the javelin and now is at the 
point where she can aim for a top-three finish in the heptathlon at The 
Athletics Congress junior championships this week at Fresno City College. The 
national meet is open to individuals 14 to 19 years old who have met the 
qualifying standard. 
</P>
<P>
She will compete in the heptathlon Thursday and Friday and the high jump 
Sunday. Clarke racked up a personal-best 5,034 points in winning the heptathlon 
by more than 300 points in the state junior college meet May 18-19. The TAC 
qualifying standard is 4,200. 
</P>
<P>
"The javelin is the event that I work on the most and it's still hard," Clarke, 
18, said. "It was bad. It would fly up in the air and then come straight down 
or land flat and bounce around. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of technique and so much you have to do before it leaves your 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
Too often the javelin would hit the back of Clarke's head as she prepared to 
throw it. And on the occasions when Clarke did make a clean throw, there were 
other problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It would go end over end and looked almost like a boomerang." said Advantage 
Athletics Coach Charlie DiMarco, who trains Clarke in the javelin and also has 
coached Dave Stephens, winner of the 1988 Olympic Trials. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have to clear the field when she threw during practice. Sometimes it 
would go backwards. It was wild. I didn't know what it would do. It's a very 
hard event to pick up. But now she knows how to carry herself and do the little 
things to make her look like she knows how to throw the javelin." 
</P>
<P>
At the state championships at Santa Barbara City College, the 5-foot-11 Clarke 
threw a personal-best 111 feet 9 inches. 
</P>
<P>
It was only Clarke's third heptathlon. Clarke, who threw the javelin 71-0 in 
her first heptathlon, became the first junior college woman to break 5,000 
points in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
The first day of heptathlon competition consists of the 100-meter low hurdles, 
shotput, high jump and 200; on the second day, the javelin, long jump and 800 
are contested. 
</P>
<P>
Had it not been for an unusual mishap, it is possible that Clarke might have 
won the high jump at the state meet as well. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, the City Section high jump champion during her junior and seniors years 
at El Camino Real, cleared 5-8 in the high jump in the state meet heptathlon. 
The height equaled the TAC high jump standard and was more than two inches 
higher than the winning jump in the open competition. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke did not attempt to qualify for the open high jump. 
</P>
<P>
While practicing run-ups for the open high jump at the Southern California 
preliminaries at Cerritos College two weeks before the state meet, Clarke 
suffered a severely sprained ankle while trying to avoid a collision with an 
official who inadvertently had crossed her path. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke had qualified for the preliminaries in the high jump, long jump, 400 and 
shotput at the Western State Conference finals in April, but was forced to 
scratch from all four events as well as the 400- and 1,600-meter relays. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes your ankle gives out and you shake it off," said Clarke, who 
refrained from practicing any jumping events before the state meet because of 
the injury. "This time it wouldn't. It was still sore at the state meet, but I 
tried to put (the accident) behind me." 
</P>
<P>
Now that her ankle has healed, Clarke will try to exceed her state meet total. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke amassed 4,366 points in her debut last summer and 4,934 in winning the 
Southern California junior college state qualifying meet. 
</P>
<P>
She has the No. 3 qualifying mark in the 14-competitor TAC field. 
</P>
<P>
Tish Milligan of the Knoxville Track Club is tops at 5,518 points, followed by 
Kallen Madden of Texas A&amp;M (5,042). 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that I am in a lot better shape (than at the state meet) 
and I have a lot more confidence," Clarke said. "I know I can improve on my 
marks in all of the events. I just need to stay focused and not break my 
concentration." 
</P>
<P>
The top finishers in the TAC meet will qualify for the U. S. Junior team, which 
will compete in the World Junior championships in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, Aug. 8-12, 
provided they meet the World Junior qualifying standards. 
</P>
<P>
"She's in great shape right now and going after a personal record," DiMarco 
said. "If she does well with her score, compete and keep it going, we'll be 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
DiMarco foresees substantial improvement for Clarke. 
</P>
<P>
"She is such a physical talent," DiMarco said. "She is still young and there 
are so many technical things to learn in the heptathlon. . . . She doesn't have 
a super weak event. The javelin is the weakest, but now that's starting to come 
around." 
</P>
<P>
And like Clarke, it seems to be heading in the right direction.

ANDERSON OUT TO EARN HIS WINGS FOR ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADAM BENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Garret Anderson could easily have been awestruck standing next to Dave Winfield 
in the California Angels clubhouse. Certainly the thought of playing in place 
of Winfield, and his 367 lifetime home runs, would intimidate the most talented 
prospect. 
</P>
<P>
So Winfield took it upon himself to make Anderson, the California Angels' 
fourth-round selection in the 1990 amateur draft, comfortable when the two met 
three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It was real nice to talk with him, because of all the prestige he has," 
Anderson said. "He is very well-known, but that didn't affect me when I met him 
in person. He didn't treat me like an itty-bitty guy and brush me off. We had a 
good talk." 
</P>
<P>
Winfield treated Anderson like a major league veteran, not like a soon-to-be 
high school graduate. 
</P>
<P>
As an aspiring right fielder blessed with power and speed, Anderson likely 
dreams of putting up numbers similar to the Hall of Fame-type totals that 
Winfield has accumulated. During his senior season at Kennedy High, Anderson 
hit .363 with eight home runs and five stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson also was a member of The Times' All-Valley basketball team after 
averaging 23 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield, too, had great success at basketball while playing for the University 
of Minnesota. But while Winfield showcased his considerable skills in college, 
Anderson, who graduated from Kennedy on Thursday, will head to Boise, Ida., of 
the Northwest League, a Class A short-season league, to play professional 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard it's nice out there, but I don't know what to expect," he said. 
"I'm just going up there to play baseball. It's kind of hard to believe it's 
going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson feels comfortable about his decision to sign with the Angels even 
though he had first signed a letter of intent to play baseball at Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
"I plan on going back (to college)," Anderson said. "(The Angels) gave me 
enough money to go back whenever I want to. 
</P>
<P>
"Lately, it's been kind of hard playing baseball, going to school and studying 
at the same time. I'm not using that as an excuse, but I really want to 
concentrate on baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson was a top recruit for Fresno State, and he might have been able to 
start in the outfield next season. 
</P>
<P>
"We were bringing in a number of young players," said Fresno State assistant 
Mike Rupcich, who recruited Anderson. "After losing so many outfielders, we 
thought Garret could come in and play right away. Losing him put us back a 
little bit. 
</P>
<P>
"It is tough to replace a player of Garret's caliber. He was a good one. People 
would have loved him out here." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson hopes they will love him in Boise, where he will begin play Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"When I make a decision, I don't second-guess myself," he said. "I thought 
about it a lot, and I am positive that is what I want to do. I don't have any 
regrets about it." 
</P>
<P>
Rupcich had been envisioning Anderson stroking home runs in Fresno, but he 
never pressured Anderson to honor his letter of intent. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Garret, 'If you are happy with (the Angels') package, and you are 
positive it is what you want, that's the way to go,' " Rupcich said. "He signed 
with a great organization. I hope to see him in the big leagues some day." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' scouting office shares Rupcich's vision. Rick Ingalls, the scout 
who convinced the Angels to draft Anderson, sees the outfielder as a player 
with the potential to star in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"He did show he's going to be a good hitter," Ingalls said. "With his size and 
athletic ability at 17, I think we're looking at someone who, at 20 or 21, 
could be something special." 
</P>
<P>
The first time Ingalls saw Anderson, Kennedy was playing Cleveland, whose 
lineup included Patrick Bryant, a future second-round pick of the Cleveland 
Indians. Anderson hit three home runs in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ingalls said that no single performance can sway a scout, watching 
Anderson play erased many of the doubts that had clouded his value. 
</P>
<P>
"Abilitywise, a lot of scouts liked him, but a lot of guys were turned off by 
hearsay," Ingalls said. "Some scouts in the Valley didn't care for his 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he is an outstanding kid. He was going to be drafted, but how high 
depended on what people think about his attitude and whether or not he was 
going to college. Some people had said he was set on going to Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
"We took a gamble that he could be convinced." 
</P>
<P>
The decision made, Anderson hopes the journey eventually ends in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a dream come true, because you grow up looking at them on TV," 
Anderson said of the Angels. "Little kids have dreams of playing at home. 
(Anaheim) is more or less home. It's better than playing at a place like 
Detroit."

SWANSON DECIDES ON SCHOOL -- MAYBE; 
</P>
<P>
RECRUITING: GLENDALE COLLEGE BASKETBALL, TRACK STANDOUT COMMITS TO CS 
NORTHRIDGE, THEN NEEDS TIME TO THINK IT OVER.

After months of indecision, Dave Swanson finally has chosen a school. 
Predictably, it was an unpredictable choice. 
</P>
<P>
"Dave is coming to Northridge," said Pete Cassidy, the Cal State Northridge 
basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson, who competed in track and basketball at Glendale College, had reduced 
his list to three schools -- St. Mary's for basketball and UCLA and UC Irvine 
for track -- but couldn't choose a sport or a school. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, he chose both sports and none of the schools. Or did he? 
</P>
<P>
After a Monday visit, Swanson made what Northridge coaches considered to be an 
oral commitment to CSUN. But he still has not signed anything. 
</P>
<P>
While waiting for his Northridge scholarship papers to arrive in the mail, he 
visited UCLA on Tuesday to tell track Coach Bob Larsen of his decision. 
However, he merely told Larsen he probably would go to Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm leaning toward (Northridge)," Swanson said. "CSUN right now seems to be 
the best situation for me. . . . I just want one more night to really make 
sure." 
</P>
<P>
If he does choose Northridge, Swanson will return to the school where he spent 
his freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
The first college he competed for could therefore be his last, and the last 
school he considered has become his first choice. Northridge has offered 
Swanson a combination of track and basketball scholarship aid. He will have two 
years of eligibility in each sport. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson redshirted in track his first year at Glendale after redshirting in 
basketball as a freshman at Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
During his freshman track season year at Northridge, Swanson finished sixth in 
the high jump in the NCAA Division II national meet. Last basketball season at 
Glendale, he averaged 17.5 points and more than seven rebounds per game. He was 
a two-year starter. 
</P>
<P>
"His defensive skills have improved tremendously," Cassidy said. "I never had a 
bad relationship with Dave. I never had a good feeling about his ability to 
play defense." 
</P>
<P>
Swanson would be one of 11 new players joining the Northridge basketball 
program. Cassidy said that he picked up his recruitment of Swanson during the 
past week and that he previously had believed that the Alemany High graduate 
was looking to leave the area.

WILL WORK FOR PROGRESS IN CHINA, EXILED FANG SAYS

<P>
Fang Lizhi, China's most prominent dissident, said Tuesday that he will 
continue to work for progress in his homeland as he returns to an academic life 
in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, arrived in London after Chinese authorities 
Monday allowed them to leave their yearlong refuge in the U.S. Embassy in 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had been in the embassy since shortly after the June 3-4, 1989, 
military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing, in which hundreds 
and perhaps thousands of people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
"As citizens of China, we hope to do whatever we can in the future to help 
China's continuing progress and development," Fang said in a statement issued 
Tuesday through the Royal Society in London. He did not meet with journalists. 
</P>
<P>
The society, one of the country's oldest and most prestigious scientific 
organizations, invited the 54-year-old astrophysicist to Britain. Fang will be 
a senior visiting fellow at Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy. 
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office official who met Fang and Li when they landed at Upper 
Heyford, a U.S. air base 60 miles west of London, said they were "tired but 
cheerful." 
</P>
<P>
Fang's statement said he and his wife were looking forward to a few days of 
quiet to "rest and recuperate, and to have some medical tests." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. media reports said Fang recently suffered an apparent mild heart attack 
but refused to be treated in a Chinese hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"The past year has been difficult for us, but we have received strong support 
from the international scientific community and friends everywhere," the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife and I would also like to express our heartfelt appreciation to 
President Bush, Ambassador (James) Lilley, and the staff at the U.S. Embassy in 
Beijing." 
</P>
<P>
China's decision to allow the couple to leave eliminated a major obstacle to 
better relations with the West. 
</P>
<P>
Fang and Li, a physicist, have two sons. Fang Ke is a student at Wayne State 
University in Detroit and the other, Fang Zhe, a student at Beijing University. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand that our son in China will be soon be able to study abroad, and 
we are naturally looking forward to a family reunion," Fang said in the 
statement.

In a discount-pricing experiment, Medicare will attempt to save millions of 
dollars by giving a government seal of approval this fall to a handful of 
hospitals doing cardiac artery bypass surgery, one of the most common 
operations for Americans over 65. 
</P>
<P>
The four to six institutions endowed with the label "Medicare participating 
heart bypass center" will charge a set price for all charges associated with 
the surgery, which currently costs taxpayers $2 billion a year. Medicare 
expects an average savings of 10% on each operation, which now costs between 
$15,000 and $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
SPIRALING COSTS: If the three-year demonstration project works, Medicare 
officials hope to adopt the discount pricing system for cataract surgeries and 
other common procedures. They hope it will provide one answer in the 
government's quest to control Medicare spending, which this year hit $96 
billion and is climbing at twice the rate of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Wilensky, head of federal Health Care Financing, would like Medicare to 
emulate private business, which is actively negotiating package discount 
medical contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"Being able to label yourself a government demonstration center is invoking an 
implied government seal of approval," Wilensky said in a recent interview. "The 
intent is to direct volume to these (selected) places." 
</P>
<P>
The 125,000 bypass operations performed in 1988 represented a 60% increase in 
just two years. 
</P>
<P>
If less invasive treatments don't work, Medicare will pay for bypass surgery, 
in which veins from elsewhere in the body are used to replace clogged veins to 
the heart. 
</P>
<P>
PATIENT PAYS LESS: Medicare's experiment also offers a financial benefit to the 
patient. It will continue the Medicare practice of paying 80% of the "general 
and customary" fee, with the beneficiary paying 20%. However, patients are 
currently responsible for any charges above the customary fee -- a practice 
known as "balanced billing." 
</P>
<P>
At the hospitals selected for the experiment, there will be no extra charges 
because participating doctors will agree to accept Medicare fees as full 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
Wilensky predicted that the selected hospitals will become regional magnets, 
drawing patients from a wide geographic area and possibly even offering free 
transportation for the patient and a spouse. 
</P>
<P>
THE FINALISTS: Medicare will choose four to six hospitals from a list of 10 
finalists: the Cleveland Clinic Foundation; St. Joseph's Hospital of Atlanta; 
Emory University Hospital, Atlanta; Methodist Hospital of Indiana, 
Indianapolis; The University Hospital, Boston; New England Medical Center, 
Boston; St. Joseph Mercy Hospital, Ann Arbor, Mich.; Ohio State University 
Hospital, Columbus; St. Vincent Hospital and Medical Center, Portland; and St. 
Luke's Episcopal Hospital, Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The Cleveland Clinic already does more cardiac bypass surgeries on Medicare 
patients than any other hospital -- 868 in 1988. Hospitals that win the 
Medicare contract expect to increase their volume of operations up to 5%. 
</P>
<P>
All 10 hospital finalists already enjoy good reputations as major centers for 
cardiac bypass surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Medicare originally sent letters of invitation to all 744 hospitals that 
performed cardiac bypass surgery in 1988. Some 206 responded, and Medicare 
reviewers picked 42 high-volume centers for invitation to submit a final, 
highly detailed application. The final list of 10 was selected by a review 
panel of medical experts. 
</P>
<P>
Patients are still free to have bypass surgery in any Medicare-eligible 
hospital. "We do not restrict the beneficiaries from choosing, and there is no 
penalty for not picking one of these (specially selected hospitals)," Wilensky 
said.

FLAG THAT REFUSED TO UNFURL SYMBOLIZES A DAZED CANADA LOOKING FOR ITS DESTINY;

<P>
As the grand finale of a huge nationalistic parade here, organizers had planned 
to unfurl a 90-foot Quebec flag from the heights of the city's Olympic Stadium. 
But just as one edge of the great blue and white fleur de lis began to drop, 
the wind caught it, tangling it in a bank of lights. 
</P>
<P>
Far below, 200,000 celebrants watched, dismayed, on Monday as the minutes 
ticked by and the flag stayed stubbornly trapped. So, after a patriotic song or 
two, they scattered for anticlimactic subway rides or quiet walks home. 
</P>
<P>
The mishap seemed in keeping with the confused and tentative political climate 
across Canada today. After months of debate and negotiation over whether Quebec 
should or shouldn't be constitutionally unified with English-speaking Canada, 
and after the failure of a package of amendments that would have clarified 
Quebec's powers, Canadians are more uncertain about the future now than they 
have been in years. 
</P>
<P>
Will Quebec remain a province of Canada? If it doesn't, what new form will it 
take? If it opts for full independence, what will the consequences be for the 
other nine provinces? Could they splinter into regional bodies -- or even join 
the United States? 
</P>
<P>
Outlandish as that last idea may sound south of the 49th Parallel, in Canada 
today it is considered a live and frightening possibility. 
</P>
<P>
And what about Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, the English-speaking Quebecer who 
has tried since his election in 1984 to unify French and English Canada? Now 
that his constitutional vision has failed, will his Progressive Conservative 
government be able to rule with any effectiveness? 
</P>
<P>
These questions are foremost in the minds of Canadians today, but there are no 
easy or quick answers. This summer is likely to be a much quieter political 
season in Canada than the spring: Parliament and the provincial legislatures 
will adjourn, and politicians will go home to rest and mingle with their 
constituents. A number of leading political commentators have called for making 
the legislative recess a time of reflection and healing. 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing certain for now is that Quebec is not going to declare 
independence tomorrow or for months -- if ever -- thanks to the cautious 
personality of its premier, Robert Bourassa. 
</P>
<P>
"He is very, very sensitive to polls," said Charles Doran, director of the 
Center for Canadian Studies at Johns Hopkins University. "I think the polls are 
telling him that this isn't the time to be precipitate." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Bourassa gave a major address over the weekend that managed to be both 
tough and moderate at the same time. He warned English Canadians that Quebec is 
capable of forging its own destiny -- but he added that he will not make any 
decision on province's sovereignty until he has consulted widely with activists 
in his Liberal Party. 
</P>
<P>
Bourassa had already begun those consultations in February when he set up a 
Liberal Party constitutional committee to travel around his huge, 
French-speaking province and gather opinions about sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
When Bourassa set up the party study group, analysts called the move a shrewd 
time-buying tactic. And sure enough, the committee's deliberations now are 
permitting Bourassa to wait out an extremely delicate time in his province 
without locking himself into any position. Not only are his own Liberals 
leaning toward sovereignty but polls also show that more than half of the 
man-in-the-street Quebecers are in favor of it, too, and so is the leading 
opposition party, the Parti Quebecois. 
</P>
<P>
Bourassa himself has long been a federalist, committed to the idea that Quebec 
belongs in Canada. He will use this summer to come up with concepts that 
satisfy Quebec nationalists without betraying his own leanings. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials, meanwhile, have already begun helping out Bourassa by 
offering Quebec, on a piecemeal basis, some of the powers it would have had if 
the constitutional amendments, known as the Meech Lake Accord, had been 
ratified by Saturday's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Mulroney said that he and Bourassa had already made "important 
progress" on a bilateral accord that would give Quebec more power over foreign 
immigration to the province. Immigration powers for Quebec were a component of 
the Meech Lake Accord. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration is a hot political issue in Quebec, where French-speaking 
nationalists believe they can perpetuate the power of their language and 
culture only by encouraging -- or even requiring -- newcomers to speak French. 
But it is doubtful that the sort of non-constitutional powers that Mulroney can 
now offer Quebec will satisfy Quebecers. 
</P>
<P>
"The main problem with this type of arrangement is that there is no 
(constitutional) guarantee that it won't be canceled by a future government," 
said Paul-Andre Comeau, editor of Le Devoir, an intellectual daily in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Even as he awarded consolation prizes to Quebec, Mulroney was busy meting out 
punishment to Newfoundland, the province where the Liberal-controlled 
legislature killed the Meech Lake Accord on Friday by adjourning without voting 
on ratification. The federal government on Tuesday delayed a parliamentary 
reading of a bill to fund a large oil development project off the coast of 
Newfoundland. 
</P>
<P>
Mulroney, who appeared in the House to defend the action against the bitter 
protestations of Newfoundland representatives, looked healthier and more 
relaxed than he had Friday, when the accord was officially pronounced dead. 
Then he seemed a haggard, beaten man, but he retreated to his home district for 
a long holiday weekend, and the rest seems to have readied him to take on the 
two main challenges that now await him. 
</P>
<P>
The first of these is to keep his Progressive Conservative Party caucus intact 
in the wake of the devastating personal defeat that the collapse of the Meech 
Lake Accord represented. The other will be to outrun his new rival, Liberal 
Party leader Jean Chretien, elected Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
On the first score, Mulroney still enjoys a comfortable majority in the 
Canadian Parliament. Even as his standing in public-opinion polls here has 
plummeted, the loyal support of his caucus members has permitted him to govern 
effectively. But a number of Mulroney's caucus members come from Quebec, and 
analysts had been predicting for months that if the constitutional pact died, 
the Quebec Conservatives would abandon him and sit as independents in 
Parliament, working for Quebec sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
So far, that hasn't happened. On Tuesday, when the Conservative caucus met for 
the first time since the pact was killed, only three Quebec Conservatives 
announced their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
"The big surprise was that only three left," said Comeau. "It could have been 
much worse." 
</P>
<P>
Comeau believes that it is Mulroney's new rival, Chretien, who unwittingly 
saved the day for the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Chretien is a French-speaking Quebecer, but unlike many of his fellows he is a 
staunch federalist who pooh-poohs the feelings of nationalism in his home 
province. English Canadians applaud Chretien's approach, but not Quebecers. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Mulroney's Quebec caucus members evidently concluded that if the prime 
minister's position were weakened too much and an election were called, 
Chretien would win it. And for all of Mulroney's difficulties, Quebecers know 
they can negotiate a far better deal for Quebec with him in power than with 
Chretien. So, for the moment, they are sticking with Mulroney.

WEST EUROPEANS BALK AT QUICK AID FOR SOVIETS

<P>
Western European leaders Tuesday signaled support for Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
efforts to rescue his ailing Soviet economy but fended off a Franco-German push 
for an immediate $15-billion aid package. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the 12-nation trading bloc ended a two-day summit by asking 
aides to consult with the Kremlin about urgent proposals for immediate loans 
and longer term assistance. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Charles Haughey, the host of the meeting, said the leaders are 
aware of concerns about the Soviet president's chances of success in advancing 
his economic reform program. 
</P>
<P>
The troublesome question also will be at the top of the agenda of next month's 
economic summit of the seven leading industrialized nations in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
In their final statement, the leaders praised reform efforts in South Africa 
but made no move to ease the economic sanctions imposed against the white-led 
government in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Margaret Thatcher, who has pushed for a lifting of prohibitions, 
hailed their statement urging an end to violence in South Africa. She said it 
was directed at black leader Nelson Mandela's African National Congress and its 
support for an armed struggle, which "ought to be abandoned." 
</P>
<P>
In taking a cautious approach on the Soviet Union, the officials, led by 
Thatcher, rejected an appeal by France and West Germany for immediate aid. 
</P>
<P>
"I favor support for economic reform, but there has to be reform to be 
supported," Thatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Spain's prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, said, "It wouldn't be responsible for 
the community to fix a budget (aid package) without knowing the needs." 
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, who made a strong pitch for immediate 
Soviet aid, said he is satisfied with the summit, however. He said aid for 
Moscow is a "long-term investment from which we all can benefit." 
</P>
<P>
West German banks have already agreed to grant loans totaling $3.1 billion to 
the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the help, Kohl has said he will urge the Kremlin "to adopt a 
constructive approach" toward membership of a united Germany in the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility Tuesday for the powerful bomb 
that shattered the ruling Conservative Party's exclusive Carlton Club in 
central London the night before, and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 
government warned that the largely symbolic attack was a warning that civilians 
no longer will be spared in the group's militant campaign for a united Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"This apparent change of tactics requires renewed vigilance on the part of 
everyone," David Waddington, Britain's home secretary, told Parliament as the 
two most seriously wounded victims from the blast were reported to be 
recovering in Westminster Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher, the club's only woman member, was attending a European Community 
summit meeting in Dublin when the bomb exploded at 8:30 p.m. Monday, but she 
visited the site immediately after returning to London on Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
A dozen network television cameras followed her as she poked through the 
wreckage of the 300-year-old Victorian mansion near Trafalgar Square. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very much worse than I thought," she declared. "It gets in your throat 
and nostrils. . . . These people don't like the results of democracy." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher speculated that the bomb may have been timed to coincide with the 
Dublin summit, asserting that the guerrilla army resented recent progress in 
Anglo-Irish relations. 
</P>
<P>
The IRA's statement was issued in Dublin just after Thatcher left, and it 
confirmed the worst fears of British officials who had predicted that the 
outlawed group will now target ruling party politicians as well as the British 
army units that have been similarly attacked in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The IRA wants to drive British forces out of Northern Ireland, and its 
statement declared, "While such occupation continues, and the nationalist 
people face daily oppression, the policy-makers and their military arm will not 
be safe." 
</P>
<P>
The IRA explained that it targeted the Conservative Party's posh, 158-year-old 
private club because it was "the rest and recreation center for the British 
government, who legislate for a military occupation of the north of Ireland." 
</P>
<P>
"Like Brighton in 1984, the IRA has brought the war directly to those who keep 
the British army on the streets and in the fields of Ireland." The Brighton 
reference was to the October, 1984, bomb that ripped through the Grand Hotel 
during the Conservative Party annual conference at the seaside resort on 
England's south coast. Five people died in what many consider an assassination 
attempt aimed at Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night's bomb, which police said was planted between the club's front 
door and an inner security door less than an hour before the explosion, was the 
most brazen attack on the British mainland since the 1984 bombing. And the 
symbolism was lost on no one. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb, declared London's prestigious daily, the Financial Times, "had been 
placed at the heart not only of London, but of the Establishment. Those who 
placed it had exploded the quiet preserves of members of the British governing 
class." 
</P>
<P>
Scotland Yard's chief of anti-terrorism, Cmdr. George Churchill-Coleman, 
confirmed at a Tuesday news conference that "there's not much doubt" that the 
IRA was behind the attack. "It is clear the same organization is behind the 
bombings on the mainland. We are dealing with evil and ruthless individuals who 
have no regard for human life." 
</P>
<P>
Churchill-Coleman said investigators have determined that the bomb was a 
sophisticated device consisting of 15 pounds of Semtex plastic explosives. 
Police are still examining videotapes recorded by a security camera mounted 
outside the club's front door for leads to the bombers' identities, he added. 
</P>
<P>
The attack was timed to coincide with the dinner hour at the club, but, unlike 
most nights at the club, there were fewer than 20 diners inside at the time, 
and the most seriously injured was the club's 76-year-old porter, Charles 
Henry. 
</P>
<P>
He remained hospitalized Tuesday, as did Lord Kaberry, 82, a member of the 
House of Lords. Seven others who were injured, including two Americans, were 
treated at the scene or released after being hospitalized overnight.

PANEL CALLS CHILD ABUSE A NATIONAL EMERGENCY;

Child abuse and neglect in the United States constitute a national emergency 
"so compelling that it dictates an immediate response," a federal advisory 
panel declared in a report released Tuesday to Congress and the Department of 
Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect, using unusually strong 
language, condemned the current system in the United States as failing to 
protect the nation's children. 
</P>
<P>
"Each year, hundreds of thousands of children are being starved and abandoned, 
burned and severely beaten, raped and sodomized, berated and belittled," stated 
the panel, composed of experts on children's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"All Americans should be outraged by child maltreatment," it continued. "Not 
only are child abuse and neglect wrong, but the nation's lack of an effective 
response to them is also wrong. Neither can be tolerated. Together, they 
constitute a moral disaster." 
</P>
<P>
The panel was established by Congress in 1988 to evaluate the scope of child 
abuse in the United States and to develop recommendations to correct it. The 
panel's report, the first in a series of required annual overviews, is 
scheduled to be released officially today. 
</P>
<P>
"All Americans share an ethical duty to ensure the safety of children," the 
report said. "Protection of children from harm is not just an ethical duty -- 
it is a matter of national survival." 
</P>
<P>
The United States "spends billions of dollars on programs that deal with the 
results of the nation's failure to prevent and treat child abuse and neglect," 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The number of reported cases of child abuse has soared to 2.4 million annually 
from about 60,000 in 1974, according to the report, which called the increase 
"astronomical." 
</P>
<P>
The board said that the child protection system "has not expanded to meet the 
challenges posed by the huge increase in cases," which has affected the whole 
spectrum of agencies dealing with child abuse, including law enforcement, the 
courts and mental health services. 
</P>
<P>
Child protection agencies have suffered "the greatest impact" and "have not 
been given the resources necessary to cope," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is serious business," said Deanne E. Tilton-Durfee, executive director of 
the Los Angeles County Interagency Council on Child Abuse and Neglect and a 
member of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no segment of society who can't do something about it or who won't be 
affected by it if something isn't done," she said in an interview. "We can't 
afford not to deal with the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Although child abuse occurs among all socioeconomic and cultural groups, the 
reported noted that poverty makes child maltreatment much more likely. 
</P>
<P>
"Child maltreatment is especially likely to occur when families under stress 
lack support from their neighbors," the report said. "Child maltreatment occurs 
much more frequently among socially isolated families." 
</P>
<P>
It is exacerbated also by parents' mental health problems and substance abuse, 
the report said. Child abuse associated with substance abuse has experienced 
"an extraordinary increase," it stated, adding: "The severity of the problem 
has caught all parts of the child protection system unprepared." 
</P>
<P>
The board said that its members decided to devote their first report "to 
alerting the nation to the existence of the emergency" and to recommending a 
series of "first steps" to provide a framework for changing the system during 
the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, the nation should replace the existing system with "a new national 
child-centered, neighborhood-based child protection strategy," the board said, 
adding that designing such a plan "will preoccupy the board during the next 
several years." 
</P>
<P>
Joy Byers, coordinator of public awareness activities for the Chicago-based 
National Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse, said it is "very 
encouraging to hear that a government-sponsored report is calling for a public 
outcry as a first step. The next step for the public is to find out how to get 
involved and become part of the solution." 
</P>
<P>
In the first of 31 recommendations designed to encourage the public to become 
actively involved in preventing child abuse, the panel urged all citizens "to 
recognize that a serious emergency . . . exists within American society" and to 
join with other citizens "in resolving that its continued existence is 
intolerable." 
</P>
<P>
"The board urges each American to understand that he or she is personally 
responsible for preventing harm to all the maltreated children of the nation," 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the board said, citizens should demand that their elected public 
officials publicly acknowledge that an emergency exists and "take whatever 
steps are necessary," including finding new sources of funding "to rehabilitate 
the nation's child protection system." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the panel called on public officials to view the prevention of 
child abuse and neglect "as a matter of national security." 
</P>
<P>
These officials should increase support for housing, child care, education and 
prenatal care for low-income families, "the absence of which has been linked to 
child abuse and neglect," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), chairman of the House Select Committee on 
Children, Youth and Families, praised the report. 
</P>
<P>
"The consequences of child abuse are devastating, not only for the long-term 
stability of the individual child, but the explosion in child abuse cases has 
been a key factor in overwhelming the child welfare system," he said. "The 
report is a substantive call to action on behalf of our children."

South African President Frederik W. de Klerk was warned Tuesday by nine white 
right-wing leaders that if he does not hold new elections to show he has white 
support for negotiations with the "communist" African National Congress they 
will seek to stop him by "other means." 
</P>
<P>
"If the government proceeds on this course and does not call an early election, 
then of course the government is closing the constitutional doors. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, people will be considering how to continue the fight with other 
means," said Jaap Marais, leader of the Reformed National Party, and spokesman 
for the group. 
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, who is facing mounting right-wing opposition to his reform policies, 
met for 90 minutes with four Afrikaner right-wing groups not represented in 
Parliament and actively involved in organizing both an armed and political 
opposition to the De Klerk government.

REFUSAL TO HONOR MANDELA OUTRAGES BLACKS IN FLORIDA

Outrage and embarrassment swept through South Florida's black communities 
Tuesday after six area mayors and the governor denounced Nelson Mandela for his 
support of Cuba's Fidel Castro and refused to issue proclamations honoring the 
civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an embarrassment," said Ray Fauntroy, head of the Dade County chapter of 
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. "This town (Miami), which is 
supposed to be an international city, has not responded as every other city in 
the world has (to a visit by Mandela)." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, the deputy president of the African National Congress, is to arrive in 
Miami this evening. On Thursday, he will speak to a Miami Beach convention of 
the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's refusal to denounce Castro, the Palestine Liberation Organization's 
Yasser Arafat and Libya's Moammar Kadafi, who have all endorsed the ANC's 
campaign to end apartheid in South Africa, has angered large segments of South 
Florida's Cuban and Jewish populations. 
</P>
<P>
Professing disappointment in Mandela's support of the controversial leaders, 
the mayors of Miami and Miami Beach have refused to issue proclamations 
honoring him during his visit to South Florida or to present him with keys to 
their cities. 
</P>
<P>
After outraged leaders of Miami's black community gathered at City Hall on 
Tuesday, Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez joined black elected leaders in welcoming 
Mandela to the area but he said that he would not be honored with a 
proclamation or key to the city. 
</P>
<P>
Suarez acknowledged "a rift in the community" because of Mandela's visit, but 
added: "I'm sure we could resolve our differences on international issues." 
</P>
<P>
Dade County Commissioner Barbara Carey and Opa Locka Mayor Robert Ingram, both 
black, joined Suarez in a statement encouraging "the free and open exchange of 
ideas" and "expressing our opposition to human rights violations in other parts 
of the world, such as Cuba and Libya and the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
During a meeting of the Florida Cabinet on Tuesday, Gov. Bob Martinez called 
Mandela's refusal to renounce his ties to Castro and Arafat "unfortunate," 
adding that he too would not issue a proclamation honoring Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that in terms of what he has done in his country to bring about 
freedom and liberty I think is well recognized," Martinez said. "The fact, 
unfortunately, that he spoke out on Castro and Arafat . . . I can't agree with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Miami Beach Mayor Alex Daoud said he was "appalled" by Mandela's association 
with Arafat and Castro. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the mayors of Miami, Hialeah, West Miami, Sweetwater and Hialeah 
Gardens -- all Cuban-American -- released a declaration denouncing Mandela's 
association with Castro. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela triggered the controversy last week during a televised interview, 
saying he counted Castro, Arafat and Kadafi as friends because of their support 
of the ANC during the 27 years he was imprisoned in a South African jail.

RECALLING BROKEN VOWS: IT'S A LONG, LONG STORY

President Bush may have been the most recent politician to walk away from a 
pledge of no new taxes, but he certainly is not the only one -- as history will 
attest. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ronald Reagan carefully avoided an outright no-new-taxes pledge when 
he ran for governor of California in 1966, he repeatedly promised not to impose 
a state tax-withholding system. His feet were set "in concrete," Reagan told 
voters around the state. 
</P>
<P>
But a few months after taking office, the new governor accepted a 
tax-withholding plan as part of a huge $1-billion tax hike enacted in 1967. "I 
can hear the concrete cracking around me," Reagan was forced to admit. 
</P>
<P>
And when former Sen. Russell B. Long (D-La.), was chairman of the Senate 
Finance Committee, he used to tell this story about his uncle, Earl Kemp Long, 
who was Louisiana governor in the 1940s and 1950s: 
</P>
<P>
"When Old Uncle Earl was campaigning for governor, he ran on a promise not to 
raise taxes if he got into office. Wherever he went stumping -- along every 
bayou in Louisiana -- Uncle Earl had one central theme: 'Elect me your 
governor, and you'll never see a tax increase.' 
</P>
<P>
"Well, needless to say, with that kind of campaign theme, Uncle Earl won the 
election handily, got sworn in as governor and started in to take a good look 
at the books. The first thing he found was that Louisiana was heading into the 
red. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, his administrative aide was beside himself. 'My goodness, governor,' he 
said, 'what are we going to do?' But Uncle Earl didn't hesitate a second: 'Call 
up the Speaker of the House,' he ordered, 'and tell him we're going to propose 
a tax increase!' 
</P>
<P>
"Tax increase? The aide was horrified. 'Governor,' he said, incredulous, 
'you've spent this whole campaign promising not to increase taxes. You've 
campaigned up and down every bayou in Louisiana. If you propose a tax increase, 
what'll we tell the people?' 
</P>
<P>
Again, said Sen. Long, "Uncle Earl didn't hesitate a bit" before answering. 
</P>
<P>
"Tell 'em Ah lied," he declared.

ROBBERS TAKE $10.8 MILLION IN ARMORED CAR HIJACKING 
</P>

Gunmen hijacked an armored car in a suburb of Rochester, N.Y., Tuesday and 
escaped with $10.8 million in cash, the second largest amount ever taken in a 
U.S. armored car holdup, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials said the money was being transported to the Federal 
Reserve Bank in Buffalo, N.Y., when the vehicle's driver and a woman guard 
stopped for breakfast at a market near the campus of the Rochester Institute of 
Technology. 
</P>
<P>
After the guard entered the store on East River Road in the Rochester suburb of 
Henrietta, the driver was accosted by several gunmen, one of whom brandished a 
shotgun. They reportedly entered the two-tone brown armored truck and when the 
woman guard returned, ordered both armored car employees to drive to a rural 
location about half a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
The guards were bound and blindfolded while the cash was transferred to a 
getaway vehicle, believed to be a van. After the robbers had fled, both guards 
managed to free themselves after about 15 minutes and returned to the offices 
of Armored Motor Service of America, where they notified police and the FBI. 
Neither guard was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Neil Flood of the Monroe County Sheriff's Office confirmed the amount of 
money stolen as $10.8 million. He said the money weighed between 1,500 and 
1,700 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it was a well-planned job," Flood said. 
</P>
<P>
The largest theft from an armored car in U.S. history occurred in 1982 when $11 
million was taken from the offices of the Sentry Armored Car Courier Co. in the 
Bronx. But authorities have since said much of the missing money may have been 
previously embezzled. 
</P>
<P>
Flood said that several robbers overpowered the guards after the armored car 
was parked outside the Bi-Rite Market between 7 a.m. and 7:10 a.m. Tuesday. The 
police were notified at 7:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the cash appeared to be virtually untraceable. Police and 
FBI agents searched the armored car for fingerprints and questioned the driver 
and the guard, whose names were not immediately made public. Detectives 
examined records of the armored car company and questioned other employees who 
might have known the vehicle's route. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators also questioned day shift workers at the Bi-Rite market, a small 
store serving coffee, sandwiches, subs and pizza. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second multimillion-dollar heist AMSA has suffered in the last 13 
months. 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1989, $2.9 million was stolen from an AMSA truck in East Syracuse. Two 
men drove a one-ton truck through a garage door and pistol-whipped two guards 
in that robbery. 
</P>
<P>
Two suspects are now on trial in federal court in Syracuse. One of the security 
guards involved pleaded guilty last year to taking part in the robbery.

THE 'ORG BOARD'; 
</P>
<P>
HUBBARD'S PLAN FOR IMPROVING ON '80 TRILLION YEARS' OF MANAGEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A key element of the management techniques Scientologists sell to businessmen 
is L. Ron Hubbard's "organizational board." 
</P>
<P>
Used also by the Church of Scientology, the "Org Board" divides an organization 
into seven divisions -- executive, personnel, sales, finance, training, 
marketing and qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
Each division's duties are spelled out, along with the basis for evaluating 
employee performance. 
</P>
<P>
In describing the Org Board's virtues, Scientology consultants omit Hubbard's 
colorful account of its origins -- an account reminiscent of one of his science 
fiction tales. 
</P>
<P>
During a 1965 lecture to Scientologists in England, Hubbard said his board is a 
refined version of one that was used for "80 trillion years" by an "old 
galactic civilization." 
</P>
<P>
Hubbard said the civilization died (he did not say when) because its 
organizational board lacked one division that he incorporated into his 
modern-day version. 
</P>
<P>
Declared Hubbard: "We don't want these temporary fly-by-night affairs!"

To create a favorable environment for Scientology's expansion, church 
executives are working to win allies among society's power brokers and opinion 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
It is a theme expounded in church publications. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to be able to approach the right people in order to get things done," 
wrote Heber Jentzsch, president of the Church of Scientology International, in 
the newspaper Scientology Today. "We need to to find out how to reach key 
people in the media, in government, in the control points of society, the 
people who run things." 
</P>
<P>
Underscoring the campaign's breadth and determination, a pull-out questionnaire 
entitled "Communication Lines to the World" was inserted in the newspaper. It 
asked Scientologists to list their connections to people in six areas:

</P>
<P>
While developing support in the secular community, Scientology has also been 
working hard to gain support from mainstream religious figures. 
</P>
<P>
Spearheading this effort is the Religious Freedom Crusade, a Scientology group 
that has attracted officials of various faiths. The crusade's rallying cry is 
that court actions brought against the Church of Scientology by disaffected 
members or government agencies pose a constitutional danger to all religions. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Scientologists mustered a multidenominational coalition to push a bill 
through the California Legislature requiring judicial approval before religious 
groups or nonprofit organizations can be sued for punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
The Church of Scientology had a special interest in the legislation: It has 
been ordered at least twice to pay huge punitive awards to ex-Scientologists, 
although one award was reduced on appeal and the other was set aside. 
</P>
<P>
Scientologists not sure how to recruit religious allies got some tips in a 
document provided to The Times by an ex-member, who said it was distributed at 
a Scientology meeting in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
The document suggested that Scientologists, after selecting an appropriate 
church, should attend Sunday services and praise the minister: " 'Your sermon 
was brilliant! Would you be willing to speak at our church?' (He'll have a hard 
time refusing that one!)." 
</P>
<P>
It advised them to establish good communication with the minister's wife 
because "she can be an ally or an enemy and you want her support if possible." 
</P>
<P>
After the service, "make friends with other congregation members," the document 
added. ". . . Circulate, but be sure to spend a few minutes with the minister 
and to meet his wife and family. . . . If you haven't gotten the minister's 
phone number earlier, get it before you go." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the document urged, get the ministers to write a notarized affidavit 
or letter stating that "Scientology is a bona fide religion." JOEL SAPPELL and 
ROBERT W. WELKOS

FOUNDATION FUNDS PROVIDE ASSIST TO CELEBRATED TEACHER ESCALANTE

<P>
The Scientology movement's Foundation for Advancements in Science and Education 
has befriended one of America's most celebrated teachers, Jaime Escalante of 
Garfield High School. 
</P>
<P>
Escalante is the East Los Angeles teacher profiled in the hit 1988 film "Stand 
and Deliver," which chronicled his success in teaching advanced calculus to 
barrio students. 
</P>
<P>
During the last few years, the foundation has provided Escalante with tens of 
thousands of dollars for computers, audiovisual aids, tutors and scholarships. 
In addition, the foundation has solicited contributions from major corporations 
to help Escalante's Garfield High mathematics program grow in size and 
sophistication. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the foundation has been Escalante's primary benefactor. 
</P>
<P>
He is now teaming up with the foundation to develop a series of 12 educational 
videos for distribution by the Public Broadcasting System. Called "Futures," 
the series is intended to motivate students by showing them the relevancy of 
math in the workplace. The foundation's president will be the executive 
producer, while Escalante will be host of the series. 
</P>
<P>
Escalante says he was unaware of the foundation's links to Scientology. "No, 
no," he said, "they (foundation officials) never mentioned that name." But, he 
added, it makes no difference. 
</P>
<P>
"From my point of view," he said, "I really don't mind what they are. The only 
thing I care about is that they help my students, my kids. That's my main 
goal." 
</P>
<P>
The foundation, for its part, has not been reticent about publicizing its 
support of Escalante. Its promotional literature regularly includes photographs 
of Escalante in his classroom or standing side-by-side with beaming foundation 
executives. ROBERT W. WELKOS and JOEL SAPPELL

FINAL VERSION OF FOOD PLAN REQUIRES FAT, FIBER LISTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Bush Administration Tuesday released its final proposal for sweeping 
changes in the nutritional labeling of food products. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed reforms, initially outlined by Health and Human Services Secretary 
Louis W. Sullivan in March, would require manufacturers for the first time to 
disclose detailed information about saturated fat, cholesterol and dietary 
fiber contained in their products. 
</P>
<P>
The mandatory labeling would be extended to include fresh seafood and produce, 
which have escaped such disclosures in the past. The proposals, to be published 
in the Federal Register later this week, follow months of hearings on mandatory 
nutritional labeling regulations, which have gone unchanged since 1973. 
Sullivan said that the new regulations should take effect by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Left unsettled, however, was whether states can require separate warning 
labels. Sullivan reportedly favors preemption of state regulations, but other 
Administration officials are said to believe that the states should be 
permitted to adopt more stringent rules. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the preemption dispute could affect implementation of 
California's Proposition 65, which requires strict warnings on food products 
concerning carcinogens or mutagens. 
</P>
<P>
"We should not have states add their own labeling statements on nutrition or 
food safety (as required by) Proposition 65," said Roger Coleman of the 
National Food Processors Assn. "Even villages and townships could come up with 
labeling requirements absent a national policy on food labels." 
</P>
<P>
Consumers depend on food labels as their primary source of nutritional 
information, said Sullivan, whose department oversees the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration. The FDA will implement the new regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"Simply put, Americans must be helped, not hyped or hustled in the 
supermarket," Sullivan said at a food safety conference. "The actions which I 
have outlined today will go a long way toward addressing the perplexity and 
frustration in the marketplace by making labels more clear and cogent." 
</P>
<P>
Under the regulations, the new food labels would display prominently the total 
calories from fat, and the amounts of dietary fiber, cholesterol and saturated 
fat contained in the product. Manufacturers would no longer be required to 
state sugar content, however. 
</P>
<P>
Nutritional information for fish, fruit and vegetables could be provided by 
supermarkets in the form of shelf tags or booklets. 
</P>
<P>
Three nutrients now required on food labels -- thiamine, riboflavin and niacin 
-- would become optional listings for processors under the proposed 
regulations. Certain foods, such as those served in restaurants, bakeries and 
cafeterias, would be exempt from the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to requiring information on fat, the regulations also would define 
terms such as "cholesterol free" and "low cholesterol," which Sullivan 
acknowledged have been misused by some manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
The regulation affects only those foods under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration. Meat and poultry products, which fall under the 
purview of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, are undergoing a separate 
labeling revision. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to Sullivan's announcement was generally positive. 
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased to see the issue was moved upon so quickly," said Eileen Gale 
Kugler, communications director for Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a 
Washington advocacy group. "Mandatory nutritional labeling is critical. . . . 
We think it is an important step forward." 
</P>
<P>
Kugler was critical, however, of the government's decision to no longer require 
sugar content listings.

10 HELD IN CONNECTION WITH CREDIT CARD SCAM; 
</P>
<P>
FRAUD: OPERATIVES IN 2 ORANGE COUNTY FIRMS HELPED RING TO RACK UP $2 MILLION IN 
CASH AND MERCHANDISE, SECRET SERVICE SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
Ten suspects were in custody Tuesday in connection with a Los Angeles-based 
credit card fraud ring that allegedly rang up $2 million in cash and 
merchandise sales with the help of operatives in two Orange County companies, 
the U.S. Secret Service said. 
</P>
<P>
The ring employed shoppers who would each charge $1,000 to $8,000 on fraudulent 
credit cards either in merchandise or cash withdrawals from automatic teller 
machines, authorities said. The shoppers, some of whom held regular jobs and 
moonlighted for the fraud ring, went on weekend spending sprees to vacation 
spots like Puerto Rico or Las Vegas, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Other cards were used by suspected robbers, drug traffickers and other 
criminals to buy airline tickets or pay for hotel rooms when they traveled to 
other cities, Secret Service officials said at a Los Angeles news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time the (Secret) Service has seen such widespread use of 
stolen and altered credit cards to facilitate violent crimes nationwide," said 
Secret Service Director John R. Simpson, who was joined by Los Angeles County 
Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner and Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates in announcing 
the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson said it was one of the largest credit card scam operations his agents 
have encountered. 
</P>
<P>
The cards were obtained from an operative working in an Orange County plant 
that produces blank credit cards, authorities said. The operative stole 
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of blank cards from the DataCard Corp. in Buena 
Park. The cards were going to be destroyed because of imperfections, Reiner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another operative worked at one of the nation's largest credit bureaus, TRW 
Credit Data Division in Orange. She allegedly ferried out credit histories so 
that the ring could imprint the cards with the names and numbers of active 
credit card holders. Other names were obtained by more conventional means, such 
as fishing carbon paper imprints of credit card purchases out of trash cans at 
rental car agencies, said Richard J. Griffin, head of the Secret Service office 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The sophisticated ring employed Los Angeles street gang members, from both the 
rival Crips and Bloods factions, to run errands, according to authorities. 
Ringleaders referred to the gang members as "the South-Central labor pool," one 
agent said. 
</P>
<P>
All of the suspects, including three suspected ringleaders, were arrested 
Monday night and early Tuesday by Secret Service agents after their indictment 
by the Los Angeles County Grand Jury. 
</P>
<P>
Among those arrested were Michael Smyer and Lydell Gordon, both of Los Angeles, 
who were being held on $1-million bail each. They were arraigned Tuesday in Los 
Angeles Superior Court on charges that included conspiracy to commit grand 
theft and forgery of a credit card. The names of the other suspects were not 
disclosed pending their arraignments. 
</P>
<P>
Agents displayed stacks of blank American Express cards, credit card embossing 
equipment, drugs, guns and $18,000 in cash seized during the arrests and over 
the course of the 16-month investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner said the 40-count indictment was the first obtained under provisions of 
Proposition 115, the so-called Speedy Trial Act passed by California voters in 
the June primary election. He credited the measure with speeding up the grand 
jury process, allowing his prosecutors to obtain indictments after 11 hours of 
testimony in cases that previously would have required a three-month 
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The wide-ranging investigation, which officials hailed as a model of 
cooperation between federal and local law enforcement agencies, stemmed from a 
1988 holdup in Cincinnati and subsequent use of fraudulent credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
The ring used a variety of credit cards, although American Express and Bank of 
America suffered the heaviest losses from the operation -- a combined loss of 
about $1 million, authorities said. Besides the 10 alleged ring members who 
were indicted, another 50 suspects who allegedly used the stolen cards were 
also arrested over the course of the investigation on various charges. 
</P>
<P>
Both TRW and DataCard say they believe they have tightened security to prevent 
future fraud schemes. 
</P>
<P>
"I do believe our security systems are strong and we're looking for ways to 
improve them," said TRW spokeswoman Jennifer Sanchez. "Judging from infrequency 
of instances like this, I would say our security system does work effectively." 
</P>
<P>
She said the employee believed to have been working with the ring, a customer 
relations department worker, was fired in May. 
</P>
<P>
David Gilmore, manager of corporate security at DataCard's home office 
Minnetonka, Minn., said his company takes "the same kind of care they do in 
printing currency" and has taken steps to correct the lapse that led to the 
theft of the imperfect, blank credit cards at the Buena Park plant. He said 
officials at the plant, one of two the company operates in the United States, 
keep tabs on every card produced, even the flawed blanks that are slated for 
disposal.

Day care will cost more but there will be more police protection in Anaheim 
under the city's $531-million 1990-91 budget, which was approved by the City 
Council on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
In the first major increase in the past decade, the Police Department will 
receive $2.9 million extra this year, which is a 7% jump in their current 
operating fund. Chief Joseph T. Molloy said the money is the first step in a 
plan to provide the city with additional service. 
</P>
<P>
"It's small compared to our budget, but to us it's a tremendous start," Molloy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The police staff will hire 18 new officers, who will be distributed in patrols, 
and in teams combatting narcotics and drunk driving. Four of those officers and 
one sergeant will begin a new community policing team that will work in 
targeted neighborhoods that need extra protection, similar to the pilot program 
in the Jeffrey-Lynne neighborhood, Molloy said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's budget decreased by $9 million from last year but is still the 
largest in the county. Santa Ana, which has a budget about half the size, is 
second. While Anaheim is the largest city in the county, its budget is still 
greatly oversized because its city-owned utility company accounts for about 
half of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the city will also benefit from the nearly $33-million settlement in 
its lawsuit against the Anaheim Hilton and Towers. Most of the settlement will 
be retained in a reserve fund. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the increased funds in some areas, residents will see increases in the 
costs of nearly every program offered through the city parks, recreation and 
community service department. 
</P>
<P>
Extended day care during the school year will cost up to $35 a month more, and 
weeklong holiday day care camps will be increased by up to $15 a session. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly every personal improvement and speciality class offered through the city 
-- from computer training to photography -- will cost a few dollars more. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it will cost more to rent most of the city athletic fields, golf 
courses, community meeting rooms and gymnasiums under the new budget. 
</P>
<P>
The budget needs to be approved by the start of the fiscal year, July 1. LISA

PHONE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM UNVEILED

A 24-hour telephone message system intended to assist county residents with 
personal and health-care needs and provide up-to-date information about 
countywide educational, recreational, cultural and volunteer opportunities 
began operation Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Recorded in Spanish and English by local and national celebrities, InfoPartner 
features more than 110 audio messages dealing with such topics as health, 
physical and sexual abuse, employment and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"InfoPartner is a very special gift because it will reach so many people with a 
wide spectrum of information over a long period of time," Gary Johnson, United 
Way chairman of the board, told about 200 guests assembled in the Fluor Corp. 
Flag Courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
The system is accessible from any touch tone telephone. Callers need only dial 
(714) 253-7766 then enter a three-digit code corresponding to the message they 
wish to hear. Callers are then given information about other agencies or phone 
numbers to call about their specific area of interest. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, in a message entitled "Living With Stress," K-Ocean radio 
announcer Holly Adams spells out the major causes and symptoms of stress and 
tells callers that failure to address problems associated with stress may lead 
to serious physical and mental problems. Another voice then instructs callers 
to contact the Family Service Assn. at (714) 838-7377 to speak with a counselor 
if further assistance is needed. 
</P>
<P>
Funded primarily by a $180,000 grant from the Pacific Mutual Foundation, the 
program has enlisted the support of several businesses and community service 
organizations. It is funded for the first three years but will require 
community support in order to continue, said Tom Sutton, chairman and chief 
executive officer of Pacific Mutual. 
</P>
<P>
"InfoPartner is an important community resource for our English- as well as our 
Spanish-speaking community," Sutton said. "We're really fortunate to live in 
Orange County. Many of us were attracted here from somewhere else. It is for 
that reason that many of us are motivated to do things to make sure that those 
attractive features continue and that our problems are addressed and 
minimized." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Watson, board chairwoman of the Volunteer Center of Santa Ana, said the 
message system should have a great impact on her program, which provides 
volunteers for various community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only are there messages from Barbara Bush, Gloria Deukmejian and Whoopi 
Goldberg about the benefits of volunteering, but there are specific messages 
for young people, for seniors, for corporate volunteers," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
To meet the changing needs of the community, the program will be monitored by 
United Way on a monthly basis and updated twice yearly, said George Phillips, a 
United Way worker who helped to develop the system. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to see between 100,000 and 150,000 calls the first year." 
</P>
<P>
The technical nucleus of the message system was developed by the marketing 
communications firm of Palmer, Sharritt &amp; Company Inc., which has set up 
similar programs in other parts of the country. The firm provided examples from 
users about how those programs have affected their lives. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, a message on teen-age suicide recorded by actor Mike Farrell 
prevented a young boy from committing suicide, Johnson said. In a letter to the 
actor, the boy wrote: "Many things you say seem to be true. I also happen to 
believe that it does not indicate I am insane just because I feel my life is 
not worth living any longer. I will hang in there a little longer." ROBERT E.

IRAQI AMBASSADOR TALKS ON MIDEAST

<P>
Dr. Mohamed Al-Mashat, Iraqi ambassador to the United States, on Tuesday called 
on Israel to end its occupation of the West Bank and allow the creation of a 
Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech to members of the Orange County business, education and cultural 
community in Costa Mesa, Al-Mashat also urged the United States to take a more 
active diplomatic role to bring political stability to the region. 
</P>
<P>
"The fighting is like a massacre to our people," Al-Mashat said of the 
Palestinian uprising on the West Bank. "Our children are dying, homes are being 
destroyed. The fighting must stop so that we can begin to focus on our natural 
resources, so we can upgrade the standard of living for the people." 
</P>
<P>
In the speech, sponsored by the Business Relations Council of the Orange County 
Office of Protocol, Al-Mashat said the United States "must be just as dedicated 
to recognizing Iraq's self determination as it is in recognizing it in other 
countries." 
</P>
<P>
"We have been at war for many many years and we do want peace." 
</P>
<P>
Al-Mashat also urged the United States to discourage countries such as Iran, 
with whom it fought a long and costly war, from moving on Iraqi soil. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third stop of Al-Mashat's California tour, which includes visits to 
San Francisco, Sacramento, Riverside and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Al-Mashat has been ambassador to the United Kingdom, France and Austria. He has 
held the posts of minister of higher education and of scientific research in 
his home country, where he also served as a professor of sociology at Baghdad 
University. The ambassador received a B.A. and an M.A. in criminology at UC 
Berkeley. ALLISON SAMUELS

TRASH RATE HIKED TO $9.45 PER MONTH

<P>
In response to higher fees at county landfill sites, the City Council this week 
approved a $1.69 increase in monthly residential trash rates. The new rate of 
$9.45 takes effect July 1. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major increase," said City Manager Darrell Essex, "but one 
unfortunately brought on by landfills.". 
</P>
<P>
Since January, 1989, landfill rates have been steadily on the rise. Gate fees 
have risen from $6.12 a ton in 1989 to the current level of $17.75 a ton. 
George Briggeman, who operates a disposal service for several cities including 
Cypress, says costs for new landfills as well as operating existing landfills 
have forced the increases. 
</P>
<P>
Next month's increase probably won't be the last. Briggeman told the City 
Council that county officials predict landfill rates may nearly double by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
To counter the rate increases, several recycling proposals are currently being 
studied, Essex said. Recycling would decrease the amount of trash going to the 
landfills and thus reduce the costs, he said.LYNDA NATALI

NEW COUNCILWOMAN SWORN INTO OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Karen Lloreda, who won a seat on the City Council in the June 5 election, was 
sworn into office Tuesday night, becoming the first member of the 18-month-old 
council to hail from the city's Capistrano Beach district. 
</P>
<P>
Along with Lloreda, council members Eileen Krause, who is also mayor, and Mike 
Eggers were sworn in for second terms before the regular council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little nervous," Lloreda said before the ceremony. "I'll admit to that." 
</P>
<P>
Lloreda, a political newcomer but a longtime community activist in Capistrano 
Beach, was elected on a platform of renewing the Capistrano Beach business 
district and supporting small-business owners. 
</P>
<P>
By winning a seat, Lloreda ousted incumbent Ingrid McGuire. In fact, Lloreda, 
who received many of the same endorsements that went to Eggers and Krause, 
outdistanced her opponent in neighborhoods where McGuire thought she had her 
strongest support. 
</P>
<P>
In the Monarch Beach district and Dana Point proper, Lloreda received 1,367 and 
571 votes, respectively, according to the county registrar of voters office. 
McGuire, who lives in Monarch Beach, got 1,227 votes there and 520 votes in 
Dana Point proper. 
</P>
<P>
Lloreda had her strongest support in Capistrano Beach, where she has vowed to 
help design a redevelopment project to upgrade the aging business district 
along Doheny Park Road and to protect the interests of small-business owners. 
</P>
<P>
As president of the Capistrano Beach Community Assn., Lloreda garnered support 
of many local community leaders, including the head of the Capistrano Beach 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Lloreda said she spent the weekend and much of the morning Tuesday studying the 
agenda and learning the council's protocol. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been to a lot of council meetings, and I have watched a lot," she said. 
"But it's very different knowing that you'll be up there." 
</P>
<P>
Besides helping to establish the redevelopment agency's first project in 
Capistrano Beach by July, 1991, she is interested in heading anti-drug 
programs, Lloreda said. 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Beach has the highest rate of drug-related crime in the city, 
according to a recent Sheriff's Department study. 
</P>
<P>
But, Lloreda added, drugs can be found in all parts of the city. "We are all 
concerned that we have a growing drug problem, not only in Capistrano Beach. We 
need to take control before things get worse. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard all through the campaign that the issue was the quality of life in 
Dana Point. That quality is not worth anything if you can't walk down the 
street, and you're worried that your kids are hanging around with drugs." JAMES 
M. GOMEZ

2-TERM LIMIT YET TO QUALIFY FOR BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Members of a residents group hoping to limit City Council members to two terms, 
or eight consecutive years in office, say they still need about 1,500 
signatures to qualify the proposal for the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
The group, Newport Residents to Limit Council Terms, held a rally Saturday 
outside City Hall and spokeswoman Janine Gault said that about 5,000 signatures 
had been collected. For the City Charter Amendment to be put on the ballot, 15% 
of 43,322 registered voters need to sign the petitions by July 2. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the City Council discussed the petition drive and considered two 
alternatives to the initiative that they may also place on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the proposal of the residents group, these options allow the council 
members who will be running in the fall to complete their terms if elected, 
even if they have been in office for more than eight years. The residents' 
group amendment would take effect immediately, meaning that council members 
Evelyn Hart and Donald A. Strauss, if elected, would have to resign. Hart has 
not yet announced whether she will run for a fourth term in November. 
</P>
<P>
At the session Monday, Strauss said he feels a system that would force him out 
of office days after election was "not really American." 
</P>
<P>
"I have no idea whether or not the matter will pass, but if it did, then it is 
apparent that I would then be out of a job after about 15 days," he said, 
adding that he spent about $26,000 in the last election campaign and has 
already started preparing for the 1990 elections. 
</P>
<P>
Of the seven members of the council, four -- Ruthelyn Plummer, Strauss, John C. 
Cox Jr. and Evelyn R. Hart -- are in their third term of office. Strauss and 
Hart are up for reelection in November. Currently there is no limit to the 
number of terms that a council member can serve.LAURA MICHAELIS

OFFICER ROBBED OF CAR; 4 LATER ARRESTED

<P>
Three men and a juvenile suspected of stealing an off-duty Santa Ana police 
officer's car at gunpoint were in custody Tuesday after leading Beverly Hills 
police on a 15-minute chase through Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began about 11:30 p.m. Monday when an eight-year veteran with the 
Santa Ana Police Department was forced off Irvine Boulevard between Jamboree 
Road and Culver Drive by a van as he was driving home. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the officer jumped from his 1985 Toyota Supra and ran for cover in 
bushes around the embankment when he saw someone get out of the van with a 
revolver. 
</P>
<P>
The officer fired one round at the suspect who was driving away, police said. 
</P>
<P>
About 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, Beverly Hills police officers stopped to investigate a 
van parked near a car dealership, police said. The officers were not aware of 
the earlier incident, but the van later proved to match the description of the 
one used in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Two men in the van "tried to conceal themselves" when officers drove by, 
Beverly Hills Police Lt. Robert Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
When the officers went in for a closer look, the driver of the van sped off. 
</P>
<P>
Police followed the van through Culver City, West Los Angeles and Hollywood 
before stopping it in the parking lot of Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
Both the driver and the passenger tried to run away, Curtis said. One of the 
Beverly Hills officers shot at, but missed, the passenger who dropped a gun 
holster on the ground, Curtis said. The passenger, identified as Willie Lamb 
III, 21, of Mount Union, Pa., ran back into the van and was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
The van's driver, a 15-year-old boy, also of Mount Union, was stopped by a 
police dog, Curtis said. His name was not released because of his age. 
</P>
<P>
Two other suspects, identified as Jorge Bautista Gutierrez, 19, of Hawthorne 
and Carlos Perez Perez, 19, of Inglewood were arrested a short time later near 
the Beverly Hills car dealership after allegedly breaking into several cars on 
the lot, Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
All four suspects were held at West Hollywood Jail on suspicion of robbery, 
grand theft auto and attempted auto burglary. The two suspects in the van were 
also booked on suspicion of possessing a loaded firearm. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the van was stolen in Pennsylvania. The officer's car was found 
Tuesday night in Los Angeles.MATT LAIT

CITY PUTS GRASS OUT TO PASTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Continuing its environmentally conscious bent, the City Council on Tuesday 
adopted a landscape ordinance that will require new developments to use 
drought-tolerant plants instead of lush, green lawns. 
</P>
<P>
Single-family homes and agricultural areas are exempt from the law, which will 
apply mainly to new condominium complexes and business developments. 
</P>
<P>
The law not only restricts water-guzzling grass, but also dictates what plants 
can be put next to each other based on similar climate, soil and maintenance 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
These and other restrictions were developed from studies showing that mowing, 
mulching, fertilizing and watering of turf grass is ultimately more harmful to 
the atmosphere than the benefits derived from oxygen-producing greenery, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
City planners call the law a "sustainability in landscape ordinance." Its goal 
is to promote landscaping that can thrive on its own while minimizing water 
consumption and maintenance costs. The program also helps reduce the amount of 
greenery clippings that end up in local landfills, planners said. 
</P>
<P>
A manual outlining details of the law will be presented for approval at a 
future council meeting.

IRVINE ASKS NEW STATE PROGRAM TO AID IN CONTROLLING MEDFLY 
</P>

<P>
The City Council on Tuesday adopted a resolution asking the state to establish 
a long-term plan for controlling the Mediterranean fruit fly in the event that 
the pest returns to Orange County and threatens the city's agricultural 
business. 
</P>
<P>
The council also endorsed a resolution urging the California League of Cities' 
Orange County division to back its position. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a document that could really lend itself to an improvement in state 
and local policy," Mayor Larry Agran said. "To date, most of the action by 
localities has been futile, as a legal matter, to stop the spraying." 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, based on a report by a council-appointed task force on 
malathion spraying, criticizes the state's plan of declaring a state of 
emergency after Medflies are spotted. Instead, the state should have an ongoing 
plan of attack, the resolution states. 
</P>
<P>
It further accuses state officials of mismanagement and charges that supplies 
of sterile Medflies, used to breed the pest out of existence, are inadequate 
for future infestations. The resolution also states that recurring infestations 
show that government efforts to prevent the spread of Medflies are "wholly 
inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
"The state needs to know their program is in shambles and that the people don't 
have any confidence in it at all," said Peter Navarro, a UC Irvine professor on 
the city's task force. 
</P>
<P>
To solve problems identified by the task force, the resolution suggests that 
the state conduct research into safer eradication methods than the use of 
pesticides. It also asks that the research be conducted by an independent 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the resolution suggests that the state charge fees on affected 
commercial and home agricultural products that could pay for research and 
Medfly eradication programs. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine officials also agreed to implement an education program for city 
residents if Medflies should ever be discovered in Irvine's extensive 
agricultural acreage. The program would warn people of the potential harmful 
effects of malathion, how to protect themselves properly in an area being 
sprayed and how to prevent the spread of Medflies. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution endorsed Tuesday also asks that the state increase its education 
and awareness programs in the same way. 
</P>
<P>
Aerial spraying for the Medfly ended May 30. Although portions of Orange County 
had been sprayed since November, Irvine was spared because no Medflies were 
found there.

MIKE PENNER: MITCHELL'S DEFENSE IN DEMAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Matt Beeuwsaert is sweeping backboards in Australia. Tom Lewis is looking into 
Europe. Mike Fielder switched to football long ago. And Chris Jackson is 
probably tired of hearing his name on television while some guard from LSU 
keeps whipping no-look passes on the fast break. 
</P>
<P>
The results are nearly in on The Greatest Prep Basketball Team in Orange County 
History and there is an upset in our midst. Today, the first Mater Dei dynasty 
stands to send its first graduate into the NBA -- and he didn't play one minute 
for Notre Dame or USC and he didn't set one scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
No one ever called Mike Mitchell prolific when he played at Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
But today, someone will call him a Denver Nugget or a Portland Trailblazer or 
perhaps a Chicago Bull. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 54 collegians on the board for the 1990 NBA draft, Mitchell, a 
fifth-year senior from Colorado State, is projected to land in the middle of 
the pack, probably in the vicinity of the 30th pick. A little higher and he's 
the first Colorado State first-rounder. A little lower and he's still the 
inaugural NBA draftee of the Mater Dei monster that terrorized Southern Section 
opponents during the 1982-83 and 1983-84 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Gary McKnight, the Mater Dei coach, would like to say he knew it all along. But 
he can't. 
</P>
<P>
"Beeuwsaert, obviously, was our best player," McKnight says. Obviously. 
Beeuwsaert was the big shooting guard who played the fundamentals as if John 
Wooden were a blood relative and perfected a bank shot that landed him a full 
scholarship with Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was Lewis, the county's all-time leading scorer, whose string of 
50-point efforts took him all the way to USC's starting lineup as a freshman. 
And then there was Fielder, the muscular power forward, and Jackson, the steady 
point guard. Together, they were four good reasons why Mater Dei won its first 
Southern Section championship in 1983 and went 28-2 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the headlines and the screens and the picks, however, was Mitchell. He 
was the Monarchs' designated grunt, the guy assigned to taking a charge here, 
an elbow there and the opponent's top scorer out of the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Some games, Mitchell wouldn't score a point. They were among his best. One of 
them helped earn Mitchell a scholarship to Fresno State, his first of two stops 
under Coach Boyd Grant. 
</P>
<P>
"We were playing in the Anaheim Convention Center," McKnight recalls, "and Boyd 
comes all the way down to scout him. Afterward, all I'm thinking about is, 'Oh 
great, Boyd's in the stands and he doesn't even score.' " 
</P>
<P>
But in a way, he had. Points don't impress Grant; if there's a way to win a 
basketball game, 1-0, Grant's working on it. Grant has a Marine's approach to 
basketball -- he's looking for a few good men who can run and cut off the 
baseline -- and he had just watched Mitchell hound his man for four relentless 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Grant thought Mitchell was the best player on the court. 
</P>
<P>
So once Mitchell completed his eligibility in 1985 -- he was a year younger 
than Beeuwsaert, Fielder and Jackson -- he followed Grant up the coast. That 
was one trademark of Mater Dei's 1983-84 starting lineup: All five received 
Division I basketball scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
One other similarity: All five transferred from the schools that originally 
signed them. 
</P>
<P>
Beeuwsaert went from Notre Dame to Cal before hitching up with a pro league in 
Australia. Lewis went from USC to Pepperdine and now is weighing several offers 
from European teams. Fielder went from Marist College to the Saddleback College 
football program and Jackson played basketball at UC Santa Barbara and UC 
Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
Disillusionment was something each of them shared in college. Mitchell finally 
left Fresno State after his junior season -- two seasons after Grant's 
departure -- because he and new Coach Ron Adams demanded too much of each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell wanted Adams to be Boyd Grant. 
</P>
<P>
Adams wanted Mitchell to be Magic Johnson, or at least the Big West equivalent, 
a do-everything big guard who could score enough points and win enough games to 
keep the heat of the Red Wave booster club away from Adams' neck. When Mitchell 
made the conference all-freshman team, expectations were raised. 
</P>
<P>
When Fresno finished 9-20 and 9-19 the next two seasons, Mitchell's 
relationship with Adams was finished as well. Again, Grant provided 
deliverance. Having just taken over the program at Colorado State, Grant 
offered Mitchell one final season together. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell accepted, redshirted in 1989 and returned the favor in 1990. He 
averaged 19.6 points a game, shot 56% from the field, led the Rams to a 21-9 
record and was named Western Athletic Conference player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA noticed. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'd have stayed at Fresno State, I'd have never been this close to the 
pros," Mitchell says, "because we weren't in a winning situation there. . . . 
At Fresno, pro ball was the furthest thing from my mind. There, I was just 
trying to get through the seasons." 
</P>
<P>
With Mitchell, defense is still the ticket. At the postseason all-star camps in 
Orlando, Fla., and Chicago, scouts watched Mitchell match up against the likes 
of UCLA's Trevor Wilson, Cal State Fullerton's Cedric Ceballos, Mississippi's 
Gerald Glass and Florida State's Irving Thomas. Mitchell's stock rose each time 
he shut one of them down. 
</P>
<P>
But NBA draftees also need to shoot the ball and Mitchell, once a 40% marksman 
at Mater Dei, proved he could handle that too. In his final game in Orlando, 
Mitchell scored 32 points against Thomas and Glass. 
</P>
<P>
"Orlando helped me considerably," Mitchell says. "I guess I didn't waste my 
time." 
</P>
<P>
In the past month, Mitchell has met with scouts from Denver, Portland, Chicago, 
Phoenix and Golden State. The interest hasn't ceased to amaze him. "The scouts 
say they see me as a (small) forward, maybe a No. 2 guard if I keep working on 
my outside shooting," Mitchell says. "But just to think that I might be one of 
the 54 players picked this year. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Who says it's not what you know but who you know? Mitchell knew Grant, but he 
also knew defense never goes out of style. Unlike some of his Mater Dei 
teammates, Mitchell had all the angles covered.

WHITE SOX MAKE ANGELS' COMEBACK A WASTE OF ENERGY 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bert Blyleven came undone, and the Angels looked done for. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox scored seven runs in the sixth inning Tuesday at Anaheim Stadium 
-- five of them off Blyleven, whose final act was to give up a three-run homer 
to Ivan Calderon. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, who once trailed by eight runs, scored six in the seventh, and it 
was a ballgame for those remaining from the crowd of 28,401. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels tied the score with a run in the eighth -- only to see the White Sox 
win in the ninth, 11-9, scoring two runs on four hits 
</P>
<P>
Ozzie Guillen's run-scoring single to right off Mark Eichhorn drove in Ron 
Karkovice with the tie-breaking run. Another run scored on Lance Johnson's bunt 
single to first. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had tied the game in the eighth on Luis Polonia's sacrifice to 
shallow left, which scored Dante Bichette when Dave Gallagher's throw couldn't 
get him. 
</P>
<P>
The 17 hits and 11 and runs were season highs for the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the White Sox sixth was done, the Angels trailed by eight runs. 
</P>
<P>
That much was remarkable. That they brought the winning run to the plate in the 
seventh was just short of incredible. 
</P>
<P>
They got one run back on Joyner's homer in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
They led off the seventh with back-to-back singles by Chili Davis and John 
Orton, who had replaced Lance Parrish at catcher in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
That was enough to chase Adam Peterson. Donn Pall came on, and gave up a 
run-scoring single to Bichette. 
</P>
<P>
Pall got Jack Howell to fly out, but walked Dick Schofield. Polonia forced 
Schofield at second with a grounder for the second out, but Orton scored on the 
play. Kent Anderson, in the game as a replacement at second base, reached 
safely when his sharply hit grounder bounced high and away off the glove of 
shortstop Guillen for an error, with Bichette scoring and Polonia taking third. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Edwards came on in relief, and walked Joyner, loading the bases. Max 
Venable, another of the Angels' mid-game replacements, worked to a full count 
and walked, forcing in Polonia. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox brought Scott Radinsky to the mound, and Davis, batting for the 
second time in the inning, sent him back off it with a two-run single to center 
that brought the Angels to within 9-8. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Jones came on to pitch -- the fifth White Sox pitcher of the inning -- 
and got Orton to strike out. 
</P>
<P>
The five White Sox pitchers were one short of the major league record of six, 
set by Oakland Sept. 23, 1983, against Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven, trying for his sixth victory in his past seven starts, gave up a solo 
homer to Karkovice in the second, and a run in the third on a walk and a double 
by Calderon. 
</P>
<P>
But in the sixth, all semblance of order disappeared. Karkovice, who had 
singled, scored on Sammy Sosa's triple to right. Johnson singled, driving in 
Sosa. Robin Ventura singled, and then came Calderon's three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Bailes came on to replace Blyleven, and got Dan Pasqua to ground to first 
base. But Joyner missed the ground ball, with Pasqua reaching on the two-out 
error as the ball rolled behind Joyner. 
</P>
<P>
It proved an expensive mistake. Moments later, Ron Kittle hit Bailes' first 
pitch deep into the left field stands for a two-run homer that should have been 
a solo homer. Both runs were unearned. 
</P>
<P>
Willie Fraser replaced Bailes and walked Scott Fletcher before getting the 
third out on a foul pop from the 11th batter of the inning. The Angels were out 
of the inning, but they were also out of the game -- or so it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, shut out by the White Sox in the first game of the series Monday, 
were shut out for the first four innings Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed something of a case of ineffective distribution: The Angels had 
scored many more than they needed in a 10-2 victory Sunday over Detroit. But 
after 14 innings without scoring against the White Sox, Bichette broke through 
with his eighth home run of the season, only his first since June 3. 
</P>
<P>
Bichette, reduced to part-time status since the acquisition of Dave Winfield, 
was starting in center field for the third game in a row, replacing Devon 
White, who is bothered by a strained right rib cage. Bichette, once the team 
leader in average, had only one hit in his past 27 at-bats and was batting only 
.246 before lofting Adam Peterson's pitch to dead-center, a few yards to the 
left of the 404-foot sign. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Former Dodger and Angel Jerry Reuss, released by Houston's triple-A Tucson team 
May 14, was in a White Sox uniform Tuesday, saying he can still pitch in the 
major leagues. "If I thought I was finished, I'd say so," said Reuss, 41, who 
worked out with the team with the permission of Manager Jeff Torborg. Reuss, 
who last pitched in the majors with Milwaukee last season, had a 
spring-training tryout with the White Sox as a non-roster invitee, and worked 
as a reliever with Houston's double-A and triple-A teams before his release. He 
said he has talked with two or three teams, including the Dodgers, for whom he 
threw a no-hitter against the San Francisco Giants on June 27, 1980. "Everybody 
is looking for a 25- or 30-year-old pitcher who's going to give them a complete 
game, an ERA under three, throw 90 miles an hour and have five or 10 good years 
left," said Reuss, whose career record is 220-191 in 21 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Devon White, bothered by a strained right rib cage, was not in the lineup for 
the third consecutive day. X-rays of the ribs were negative, trainer Ned 
Bergert said. White's name has resurfaced in trade rumors, this time in 
published reports out of Houston of a possible trade with the Astros for second 
baseman Bill Doran. Pitchers Willie Fraser and Mike Fetters also have been 
mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Mike Port made no report of the hearing Monday in New York on 
the Angels' complaint against the Yankees in the Witt-Dave Winfield trade. The 
hearing lasted a little more than two hours, and a decision is expected 
"shortly," a spokesman for the commissioner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Bert Blyleven was elected as the Angels' representative to the Major League 
Baseball Players Assn., replacing Mike Witt. Blyleven has been the acting 
player rep since Witt was traded to the New York Yankees in May. Wally Joyner 
is the alternate.

New Director Due: Members of the Orange County Motor Car Dealers Assn. will be 
introduced to the 52-year-old trade group's new executive director, Rod 
Alberts, at its summer meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Offsetting the hellos will be goodbys to retiring director Jim Upp, who has run 
the organization since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Upp, a former Los Angeles region Ford marketing executive, said he is heading 
into semi-retirement. He plans to play, but also will remain a part-time 
consultant to the dealer group, helping run the service technician training 
program it sponsors in conjunction with Fullerton and Saddleback community 
colleges. Upp said he also will do some free-lance marketing consulting. 
</P>
<P>
Alberts, who officially starts July 2, comes to Orange County from a stint as 
assistant vice president of the Arkansas New Car Dealers Assn.

HOUSE RESALES DECLINE WHILE MEDIAN PRICES CLIMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Orange County's single-family resale housing market continued a nearly 18-month 
downward tumble in May as sales fell 17.2% from a year ago, the California 
Assn. of Realtors reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the median price of a resale home in the county rose nearly 
6%, to $256,990 from $242,677 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The median price was 5% higher than April's $244,784, making Orange County the 
only one of the state's major urban areas to post both month-to-month and 
year-to-year increases. 
</P>
<P>
The price hike was caused by a spurt in sales of larger homes as sellers 
apparently began lowering asking prices in response to the slower market, 
industry specialists said. 
</P>
<P>
Statewide, sales were down 11.2% from May, 1989, and the median price of a 
resale home, at $196,094, was off 2.5% for the year. 
</P>
<P>
The declining sales pace in Orange County, based on reports from area realty 
boards, represents a 35% decline since May, 1988, when new and used homes in 
the county were selling almost as fast as realtors could put up "for sale" 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
But the slowdown -- hard as it is on Realtors' pocketbooks and sellers' 
patience -- still doesn't signal a housing slump, said Leslie Appleton-Young, 
vice president and chief economist for the state realty association. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she maintained, the slowing of sales activity -- caused both by the 
county's high prices and by buyer uncertainty over interest rates -- has merely 
"brought Orange County sales back to where they were in 1987, and that was 
considered a pretty good year." 
</P>
<P>
The best indicator of the resale market's health, she said, is the backlog, or 
the approximate time it would take to sell all listed homes at the current 
sales pace. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of the sales boom two years ago, the Orange County backlog was 
five months. Currently, it is about 10 months. A normal market backlog, she 
said, is 10 to 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
The county's May sales activity actually was up 2.3% from April and the 
May-to-May sales decline wasn't as steep as in Los Angeles and San Francisco 
counties, where single-family resales activity for the 12 months was down 19.4% 
and 22.9%, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
The realty association's figures also do not include sales of condominiums or 
other attached homes, which reportedly are making up an increasing share of 
overall resales in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Attached housing sales are a big part of the market these days," said Chuck 
Neubauer, vice president and Orange County regional manager for Coldwell Banker 
Residential Real Estate. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't hold with all this doom and gloom stuff, because you don't get a 
realistic picture without the attached unit sales being included," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Appleton-Young said the increase in the median price of resale single-family 
homes in the county in May came largely from unusually high sales of large 
homes. Homes with four or more bedrooms, she said, accounted for 44.6% of all 
Orange County resales last month, contrasted with only 20.3% in Los Angeles 
County.

GOVERNOR VETOES BILL TO BAN RABBIT SKIN TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Expressing concern about outlawing "a viable testing option" to ensure consumer 
safety, Gov. George Deukmejian has vetoed a bill that would have made 
California the first state to ban eye and skin tests on rabbits in the 
development of cosmetics and household products. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which had wide support from humane societies and other animal 
rights advocates, would have been a boost to Ropak Laboratories, an 
Irvine-based firm that has developed a test tube alternative to the traditional 
Draize test, which relies on rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
Donna Pane, legislative assistant to Assemblyman Jack O'Connell 
(D-Carpinteria), author of the bill, said it would be futile to try to persuade 
Republicans in the Legislature to override the governor's veto. 
</P>
<P>
She said, however, that the bill had bipartisan support in both the Assembly 
and Senate, and that O'Connell will come back with a similar legislative 
proposal after a new governor takes office next year. 
</P>
<P>
Pane said she believes Deukmejian didn't thoroughly understand the issue and 
listened only to the position of manufacturers who contended that animal 
testing continues to be necessary. She complained that he bought "industry's 
line -- hook, line and sinker." 
</P>
<P>
Ropak remained neutral in the political battle over the proposed legislation, 
in part because its customers are manufacturers of cosmetics and household 
products, some of which have completely converted to non-animal testing but 
nonetheless oppose an all-out ban on Draize. 
</P>
<P>
Ropak Vice President Virginia Gordon, who was responsible for developing 
Ropak's testing process, said she personally opposes forcing manufacturers to 
abandon animal testing. She said she would prefer legislation that instead 
would offer manufacturers financial and other incentives to switch to 
non-animal testing alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon said, however, that "just having the bill get where it did" created a 
new awareness in the scientific and manufacturing communities of the strides 
that have been made in developing non-animal tests.

OPERA TEACHER WHO PLANNED NEW TROUPE DIES 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Kurkjian, a former Cal State Fullerton music professor who had 
ambitious plans to start a new Orange County opera company, was found dead 
Monday in his Laguna Beach home. He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of Kurkjian's death was unknown after an autopsy and is under routine 
investigation, the Orange County coroner's office said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"At this time we do not believe foul play was involved," Police Sgt. Robert 
Rahaeuser said. 
</P>
<P>
Kurkjian, who had been a member of Cal State Fullerton's staff since 1972, was 
director of its opera workshop from 1976 until he announced his early 
retirement this spring after problems with the administration of the 
university's school of the arts. He was formerly artistic director of the Lyric 
Opera of Orange County, the Laguna Beach-based troupe that eventually became 
Opera Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Kurkjian's problems at the university stemmed from troublesome personal 
relationships, according to Benton L. Minor, music department chairman. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael was a very intense, talented individual, musically," Minor said 
Tuesday. But "he had a lot of highs and a lot of lows, from an emotional 
standpoint. . . . The fact that he reacted to crises strongly, in his personal 
life with his friends, caused some difficulties with his assignment here." 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, during his last two semesters, Kurkjian was away on sick leave at 
least half of that time, said Minor, who declined to elaborate on the nature of 
Kurkjian's absenteeism. 
</P>
<P>
Burton Karson, CSUF professor of music and artistic director of the annual 
Corona del Mar Baroque Festival, said, "He often had problems with the 
(university) administration and with his personal relationships with colleagues 
and students, but he was a splendid musician, and he was able to give musical 
ideas and techniques of great value to his students." 
</P>
<P>
Kurkjian, considered an important force behind the local opera scene, recently 
announced plans to launch a new Orange County opera company. The Laguna Opera 
Theatre was reportedly planned as a small, professional repertory troupe geared 
for young singers breaking into the field. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Rodgers, a composer and Cal State Fullerton music professor who was to 
have been the company's artistic associate, said Tuesday that the project will 
probably not proceed. 
</P>
<P>
"Tentative plans had been made for three little mini-seasons next year at the 
Forum Theatre," a 230-seat venue in Laguna Beach, Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
But the company existed "mostly in Michael's head and on paper and needed 
another couple of months of organization and planning to get it to the point 
where it could continue without him," Rodgers said. "With his death, I'm sure 
it will probably not continue." 
</P>
<P>
Kurkjian received a bachelor's degree from Washington University in St. Louis 
in 1952 and a master's degree in piano at the University of Illinois, Urbana. 
</P>
<P>
Aspiring initially to be a concert pianist, he was a soloist with orchestras in 
the Midwest but switched his focus to voice after developing arthritis in his 
hands, according to Minor. 
</P>
<P>
Information on funeral arrangements was not available Tuesday.

PACIFIC SYMPHONY OFFICIALLY ACCEPTS $45,000 NEA GRANT

Pacific Symphony, which had announced that it would accept a $45,000 grant from 
the National Endowment for the Arts, has received official notification of the 
award and will indeed accept it, Pacific Symphony executive director Louis G. 
Spisto said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Several U.S. arts groups have rejected NEA subsidies rather than sign what is 
being described as an anti-obscenity pledge. 
</P>
<P>
Spisto said his organization will continue to fight for an NEA that does not 
restrict the content of artworks. Pro-NEA letters to legislators and concert 
audiences will continue through the summer, he said.ZAN DUBIN

COUNTY, CITIES SEEING PAYOFF IN EFFORT TO DRAW FILMMAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A joint effort among state, county and city officials to keep Hollywood 
filmmakers from leaving California to make movies is showing modest but 
tangible results for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Film-making is increasing in some Orange County cities and could double this 
year in unincorporated areas, according to figures released recently by the 
Orange County film liaison office. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the relatively small numbers aren't likely to cause Hollywood 
Chamber of Commerce officials to start crying "Exodus." 
</P>
<P>
As of June 15, the office had issued 16 permits this year to motion picture 
companies filming in unincorporated county areas, just one fewer than in all of 
1989, according to county film liaison Lolly Powell. With heightened activity 
anticipated during summer months, at least twice as much filming is projected 
during 1990 over last year, Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be my hope that it would triple, but it's been a surprise so far that 
we've increased that much," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some cities -- including Newport Beach, Santa Ana, Fullerton and Laguna Beach 
-- also report that movie companies are becoming more familiar sights. In 
Newport Beach, the Orange County city most popular with filmmakers, 22 permits 
have been issued to commercial film production companies so far this year, an 
18% jump over the first half of 1989, said licensing supervisor Glen Everroad. 
Most filming in Newport takes place after August, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Laguna, where 100 crew members and extras descended last week to shoot an 
NBC television miniseries, filmmakers have become regular guests, said Cindy 
King, Laguna's director of recreation and film liaison. 
</P>
<P>
King said the increase can be explained by Laguna's quaintness and cooperation, 
adding that the city has simplified the permit-granting process to encourage 
filmmakers. Similar goals were on the table last month during the California 
Film Commission's first meeting with both city and county liaisons. 
Participants are hoping the connection will result in a closer working 
relationship between the groups. 
</P>
<P>
The commission was created in 1985 to tether filmmakers who were being wooed 
away from California by other states. In 1988, with productions lost to other 
states still costing California $3 billion, a county liaison office was 
established to help tackle the problem. Last fall, film industry insiders and 
some local officials were still bemoaning what they called the "bureaucratic 
nightmare" of making movies in Orange County, a problem the county and state 
film offices have since been striving to solve. 
</P>
<P>
"There's still work to do," said Michael Walbrecht, commission associate 
director, who added that as of last week, only a couple of Orange County cities 
have adopted the commission's "model process" for film permits. By adopting 
that process, cities would have a uniform procedure in place of the myriad 
different policies, ostensibly making it easier for film companies to move from 
city to city for shooting. 
</P>
<P>
However, Walbrecht added, in part because more Los Angeles neighborhoods are 
becoming "burned out" with constant film activity, production companies are 
increasingly setting their sights on surrounding counties. Cities that catch a 
filmmaker's fancy can reap hefty financial rewards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
While filming "Defending Your Life" with Meryl Streep and Albert Brooks in 
Orange County recently, Warner Bros. spent $200,000 and hired 1,000 extras in 
10 days, Walbrecht said. Statewide, the industry spends about $5.25 billion a 
year and employs 118,000 people directly and 115,000 indirectly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very clean industry that usually comes into your community, spends a 
substantial amount of money and then it goes away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But not always. Just ask Newport Beach officials. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, in one of the more ill-fated episodes in county film-making, a 
production company rigged a 46-foot yacht to explode in the Upper Newport Bay 
ecological reserve without getting a city permit, Everroad said. When silt 
clogged the water lines on the fire-suppression boats, the fire, scheduled to 
burn for 30 seconds, raged in the Back Bay for 40 minutes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing was a bomb floating out in the middle of the harbor." Debris 
dirtied the bay, cinders settled on yachts and ashes drifted into koi ponds and 
pools.

"It was a mess," Everroad said of the misadventure that took four months to 
clean up. "We had a bunch of upset people." 
</P>
<P>
Popular coastal sites include the Newport Beach piers, the Balboa Fun Zone and 
Crystal Cove, where portions of the movie "Beaches" were filmed. Laguna Beach 
was chosen as the backdrop for "Jackie Collins' Lucky," a six-hour television 
miniseries, because it most closely resembled the south of France, location 
manager Karen White said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's foreign-looking in a way," White said. "We were looking for something 
colorful, something that had some character and something that had a more 
limited beach than, say, Hermosa, which goes on like the Sahara." 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Ana, with its stately, historic County Courthouse, generic stadium and 
recently refurbished historical homes, film-making "has increased 
tremendously," said liaison Maria Schlinger. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone in Orange County is seeing the fallout. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange, the site of a 100-year-old traffic circle and picturesque shops that 
have provided the backdrop for films in years past, there has been no increase 
in filming this year, a city spokeswoman said. And in Huntington Beach, where 
marine safety captain Bill Richardson said scant permit fees should be 
appealing, there has been little change. 
</P>
<P>
One barrier for filmmakers who might be tempted to venture into counties 
surrounding Los Angeles has been an industry regulation that prescribes extra 
pay when Los Angeles-based film companies travel more than 30 miles from a 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, even when production companies are lured outside the radius and 
into Orange County, residents don't always share the enthusiasm of local 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
With more than 15 trucks, trailers, busses and vans blocking the ocean view at 
Laguna's Heisler Park on Friday, Al and Peg Difley stopped their morning walk 
to watch cameramen wave off cars attempting to park along Cliff Drive. The 
Difleys, who live a block from the the location site where crew members sipped 
coffee and ate doughnuts, said such scenes are no longer a novelty. 
</P>
<P>
"You see they've taken the whole street," Al Difley said. "Once in a while it's 
all right, but not too often."

MAN DIES AFTER BEING SHOT DURING ROLLING TRAFFIC DISPUTE

<P>
A man who was shot during a dispute between occupants of two cars that were 
traveling through Chatsworth died early this morning, Los Angeles police 
reported. No arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Galdamez, 23, who is believed to have lived in the Canoga Park area, died 
at Northridge Hospital Medical Center about 12:30 a.m., Lt. Harvie Eubank said. 
</P>
<P>
Galdamez had been shot in the upper body about five hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Galdamez was an occupant in a car that was westbound on Nordhoff Street, police 
said. At Tampa Avenue, Galdamez and the driver began shouting with two men who 
pulled up next to them in a blue-gray Toyota pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
As the two vehicles continued, insults were shouted back and forth, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, police said, the driver of the pickup truck stuck a gun out his window 
and fired several shots at the car, hitting Galdamez once. 
</P>
<P>
Galdamez was driven by his friend to the hospital. The driver, whose name was 
not released, then left the hospital "because he didn't want to be involved," 
Eubank said. He was found this morning and was being questioned by detectives, 
although he is not a suspect in any crime, Eubank said. 
</P>
<P>
Police were still looking for the pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
Eubank said investigators had not determined what the dispute was about, but he 
said it did not appear to be gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
"From what we know now, it was just a traffic dispute," Eubank said.

Carlos, the world's most wanted terrorist, was given refuge by Hungary's former 
Communist government at the end of the 1970s and early 1980s, Interior Minister 
Balazs Horvath said today. 
</P>
<P>
Horvath told a morning television program that Carlos was sheltered in Hungary 
with the full knowledge of senior members of the government, possibly including 
the late Communist leader Janos Kadar. 
</P>
<P>
"Carlos and his team stayed in Hungary with the permission of the Politburo at 
the end of the 1970s and the early 1980s," said Horvath, who took office with 
Hungary's first post-communist government last month. 
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan-born, Carlos' real name is or was Ilych Ramirez Sanchez. He joined 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in the late 1960s and was 
credited with guerrilla operations stretching from Western Europe through the 
Middle East to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Fours years ago, the Israeli newspaper Davar said he was believed dead and 
buried in Libya.

DEMOCRAT OK OF SPENDING CUTS LINKED TO NEW TAXES

<P>
Democrats must agree to major spending cuts as the price for President Bush's 
concession that taxes will have to be raised to attack the budget deficit, a 
leading Senate Republican said today. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) made the remark on CBS-TV's "CBS This Morning" as 
negotiators from the White House and Congress resumed their deficit-reduction 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
"It's time to summit or get off the pot," Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, a 
Republican bargainer, told reporters as the closed-door talks got under way. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said Tuesday that a budget pact will require "tax revenue increases," 
which Democrats hailed as an abandonment of his "no new taxes" campaign pledge. 
Domenici, the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, said the key 
question is not whether GOP lawmakers will back the President's new position. 
</P>
<P>
"It's whether Democrats will now restrain spending enough to make a package 
that is indeed right for America," he said. 
</P>
<P>
On the same program, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee said 
increased excise taxes will have to be part of any deficit-reduction package. 
</P>
<P>
"Excise taxes are going to be necessary in the equation because you raise 
revenues immediately," Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) said. 
</P>
<P>
The government levies excise taxes on fuels, cigarettes, liquor and other 
items. Rostenkowski did not specify which tax increases he favors, but in the 
past has advocated boosts in gasoline, cigarette and alcohol levies. 
</P>
<P>
House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois today gave a cautious 
reading of Bush's statement. Appearing on NBC's "Today" show, Michel said, "The 
President didn't tell us yesterday, 'The first thing I want you to do is go 
down there and raise taxes."' 
</P>
<P>
But House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), appearing on the same program, 
said that Bush, by his statement, "has said publicly and clearly that he 
believes new taxes are necessary." 
</P>
<P>
"There are going to be some hard hits," Michel said. "The President is taking a 
hit for the moment, I think temporarily."

W. GERMAN GUILTY IN LIBYAN PLANT CASE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A court today convicted a West German industrialist of helping Libya build a 
plant that Western officials say was intended to produce poison gas. 
</P>
<P>
Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, described by prosecutors as a "merchant of 
death," was found guilty of violating export laws and tax evasion. He was 
sentenced to five years in prison for his involvement in construction of the 
widely publicized plant in the Libyan city of Rabta, south of Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
Libya has said the Rabta plant was intended for producing pharmaceuticals, but 
U.S. and West German officials have said it was built to manufacture chemical 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Chief Judge Juergen Henninger said that, based on expert witness testimony, the 
state court concluded that the plant was "clearly intended for the production 
of chemical warfare agents," including mustard gas and other poison gases. 
</P>
<P>
Henninger said Hippenstiel-Imhausen also was aware of the plant's purpose even 
before he signed the contract in 1984 to build it for Libya's leader, Col. 
Moammar Kadafi. 
</P>
<P>
As the verdict was read, the pale, bespectacled Hippenstiel-Imhausen often sat 
with his head in his hands, leaning toward the table in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
Hippenstiel-Imhausen, 49, admitted at his trial earlier this month that he 
helped build the chemical plant while he headed the Imhausen-Chemie company of 
Lahr, a southwestern city near Mannheim. 
</P>
<P>
The case was a major embarrassment for the West German government, which 
initially denied that West German firms were involved in the project. West 
German law forbids the export of technology or material that could be used in 
conflict areas such as the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Henninger sentenced the defendant to the maximum three years for 
violation of export laws and four years for tax evasion. But he then reduced 
the combined sentence to five years because Hippenstiel-Imhausen has shown 
remorse for his actions and admitted his role. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling followed an 11-day trial, one of the most highly publicized business 
trials in West German history.

TRADE, NOT AID, WILL CURE LATIN ILLS, BUSH SAYS

President Bush today said he wants to bolster Latin American economies with a 
new partnership that includes a free trade zone encompassing the American 
hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
"The prosperity of our hemisphere depends on trade, not aid," Bush said in an 
address to Latin American diplomats in the White House East Room. 
</P>
<P>
"We must forge a genuine partnership for free-market reform," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to allay the fears of regional leaders that their problems have been 
overshadowed by the move toward democracy and market economies in most of 
Eastern Europe, Bush declared: 
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to the day when not only are the Americas the first fully free 
democratic hemisphere -- but when all are equal partners in a free trade zone 
stretching from the port of Anchorage to Tierra del Fuego." 
</P>
<P>
He said that barriers to free trade won't fall overnight, but that Washington 
is prepared to enter free trade agreements with countries in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also said the Latin American "investment climate remains clouded by the 
heavy burden of debt" and announced "a major initiative to reduce Latin 
American and the Caribbean's official debt to the United States." 
</P>
<P>
The new approach represents an implicit admission that the so-called Brady Plan 
for debt relief has fallen short of its goals. 
</P>
<P>
That plan, unveiled by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady in March, 
1989, was intended to free funds for new investment by reducing the debt load 
of Latin American and other debtor nations through negotiations with creditor 
banks.

Former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter appeared today before a 
federal grand jury that was recently impaneled to continue investigating the 
Iran-Contra scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Poindexter, who was sentenced June 11 to six months in prison for lying to 
Congress about the Iran-Contra affair and obstructing inquiries of 
congressional committees, testified behind closed doors at the U.S. Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
A prosecutor from the office of independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh 
accompanied Poindexter into the grand jury room. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury, which has already heard testimony from former National Security 
Council aide Oliver L. North, is expected to try to perform a final assessment 
of the degree of knowledge that President Ronald Reagan and then-Vice President 
George Bush had of the affair.

AT&amp;T today said its profit in the second quarter probably will be lower 
than last year's in part because sales of various products have fallen short of 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
The softness will make it more difficult for American Telephone &amp; Telegraph 
Co. to meet its long-term objective of achieving 10% to 12% growth in annual 
earnings, the company said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
But AT&amp;T said it stands by its earlier projection that net income for all 
of 1990 will rise to a record level. This year's profit is expected to surpass 
the 1989 earnings of $2.7 billion, or $2.50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
The company blamed market conditions and a sluggish economy for weakening its 
product sales in the quarter that ends Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T spokesman Dick Gray said results from April and May indicate sales to 
small and large U.S. businesses of telephone equipment, including such things 
as electronic switchboards, have been unexpectedly low. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of network telecommunications products, such as switching equipment, 
cable and transmissions systems, also have been below anticipated levels, Gray 
said. There has been some weakness in sales to the federal government, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, heavy demand for AT&amp;T's Universal Card has caused expenses to 
rise in the second quarter, the company said. AT&amp;T called the demand for 
the new credit card, introduced in March, unprecedented and twice the level 
expected.

Braniff Inc. acknowledged today in a filing with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission that the company will probably default on payments to unsecured 
creditors and not make distributions to stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
Braniff Inc., the Orlando, Fla.

<P>
-based parent company for Braniff Airlines, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection last fall and began liquidating assets to cover its $300 million in 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
But with the sale of its last major asset -- the rights to buy 74 Airbus 
Industrie A-320 planes -- Braniff is conceding that most of its creditors will 
not be paid and that its shareholders will not receive distributions. 
</P>
<P>
It is also likely that $100 million of Braniff junk bonds, whose holders 
include Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., Connecticut National Bank of Hartford, and 
Citizens &amp; Southern National Bank in Atlanta, will not be repaid.

Talks between Japan and the United States on structural trade reforms 
progressed today with a last-minute breakthrough on the issue of increasing 
Japan's public works spending, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu conveyed Japan's final offer on the issue to 
President Bush in a telephone conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he will hear details of the talks from U.S. officials and expressed 
appreciation for Kaifu's efforts, according to a high-ranking Foreign Ministry 
official. 
</P>
<P>
"This represents a breakthrough," said the official, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. "Without an agreement on public works spending . . . I doubt we 
could finish the talks by (Thursday)." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry officials said they could not confirm reports that Japanese 
and U.S. officials had agreed on a final figure of $2.77 trillion in public 
works spending over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Local media said Kaifu and other top Japanese officials, meeting in a 
last-ditch move to salvage the talks, had agreed to increase their original 
proposal of $2.68 trillion by $96.77 billion.

Salant Corp. today filed for bankruptcy court protection from its creditors, 
saying weakness in the retail apparel business has made it impossible to pay 
its debts. 
</P>
<P>
Ray W. Williams, Salant's chairman and chief executive, said the company 
believes it can continue operating while it negotiates with creditors and 
attempts a court-supervised reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
Salant accumulated debt in acquiring a much larger apparel manufacturer, 
Manhattan Industries Inc., in early 1988. Before taking over Manhattan, Salant 
mainly was a maker of private label clothing for retailers, such as Sears, 
Roebuck &amp; Co. and J. C. Penney Co. 
</P>
<P>
There are numerous national names under Manhattan, including Manhattan shirts, 
Lady Manhattan sportswear, Perry Ellis women's and men's wear and Vera scarves 
and apparel items.

KATHLEEN TURNER GIVES BENEFIT AUCTION THE SLIP 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sure, anyone can give someone the slip, but actress Kathleen Turner's slip 
costs $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
The slip, which she has been wearing in the play "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," was 
one of 29 items sold Tuesday night at a black-tie dinner and auction for Easter 
Seals. 
</P>
<P>
The auction raised $30,000 for the charity that aids people with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
Bidding for the slip started at $500 and quickly grew after auctioneer Diddi 
Lynn Worsole informed potential buyers that the slip was not in the room 
because Turner was wearing it just a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
"She's sweating in it right now," Worsole said. "Maybe there will be a little 
perfume on it." 
</P>
<P>
The bidding quickly escalated in increments of $100 until Staten Island real 
estate broker Henry Setaro came in with the top bid of $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the closest I will ever get to Kathleen Turner," Setaro said. "I hope 
they don't wash it before I get it."

Singer and actor David Malek has sidestepped Broadway and leaped from Toronto's 
tiny theater scene to London's West End by winning the lead role in Andrew 
Lloyd Webber's latest musical, "Aspects of Love." 
</P>
<P>
Malek, who is from Ottawa, is taking over for David Greer as Alex in the 
musical playing at London's Prince of Wales Theater. 
</P>
<P>
The role will almost guarantee Malek future stardom by putting him in the 
center of the Lloyd Webber star-making machine. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything he has done has been a big hit," Malek, 26, said in a recent 
interview in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
"It really is a great opportunity for me to move forward. Being so close to New 
York, I always thought the next step was going to be Broadway, but if you look 
at where all the musicals have been created over the last few years, London is 
it," Malek said.

Singer Dionne Warwick says AIDS education campaigns must target minorities, and 
in words that are understandable to those who don't have a high-school diploma. 
</P>
<P>
The Grammy-winning singer told an international AIDS and ethics forum Tuesday 
that health officials have reached the educated, white, gay male population. 
</P>
<P>
"We must develop new models that are culturally sensitive and 
community-specific," Warwick said in calling for "bilingual" AIDS educators who 
also know the language of the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Having our health decisions made by Caucasian males, while it has never been 
satisfactory, is no longer acceptable," said Warwick.

A University of Maryland nuclear engineering professor today denied allegations 
that he sexually abused his daughter for more than 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
Frank J. Munno, 54, was indicted Tuesday by a Prince Georges County grand jury 
on felony charges after Angela Mattson told that authorities her father 
sexually abused her from the third grade through graduate school. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleading not guilty because I'm not guilty," Munno said in a telephone 
interview from his College Park home. 
</P>
<P>
"Shocked and outraged would be the words to describe the feelings I'm trying to 
keep inside," he said. "My family is supportive and very disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Mattson, 28, an engineer with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said she made 
the abuse allegations public because she hoped to help other victims of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Munno, a tenured, $89,000-a-year professor, heads the nuclear engineering 
program on the College Park campus, the largest in the University of Maryland 
system. He has been at College Park 32 years. 
</P>
<P>
He said he will not take a leave from his teaching position. "Why would I be 
any worse a teacher because I was accused," said Munno. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury charged Munno with incest, child abuse, unlawful carnal 
knowledge, and unnatural and perverted sex practices. He faces a maximum of 15 
years in prison, if convicted on all the charges.

Sprinter Ben Johnson's former personal physician and another Toronto doctor 
accused of giving steroids to Canadian athletes were charged today by the 
Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons with professional misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jamie Astaphan, Johnson's doctor until the 1988 Seoul Olympics scandal, and 
Dr. Ara Artinian face the possibility of having their licenses revoked and 
fines up to $10,000, college spokesman Linda Franklin said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our investigations have been under way since the Seoul Games," Franklin said, 
adding that the college had decided to delay the charges until after the 
release of the Dubin report. 
</P>
<P>
The report, the product of a federal inquiry into drug use in Canadian sports, 
was released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was stripped of a gold medal and a world record at the Games after 
traces of banned anabolic steroids were found in his urine. 
</P>
<P>
At last year's federal inquiry sparked by the scandal, Astaphan admitted before 
Justice Charles Dubin that he administered a complex regimen of the 
muscle-building drugs to the sprinter and several other Canadian athletes. 
</P>
<P>
Artinian also admitted that he gave several Canadian athletes steroids, 
although he said he prescribed the drugs only to counteract a range of 
ailments, including irritability and hives. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin, a spokeswoman for the college, which licenses doctors in Ontario, 
said the college carried out its own investigation, which was completed about 
one month ago.

Calm returned to Wimbledon today. After a day of uproar and upsets, top players 
led by defending champion Boris Becker and women's third seed Monica Seles 
moved into the third round with relative ease. 
</P>
<P>
Becker especially seemed to jerk the tournament back to normal, a day after 
seven seeds -- including three-time champion John McEnroe -- were eliminated in 
the first round. 
</P>
<P>
The men's second seed had trouble with his serve early against Australian Wally 
Masur. But by the middle of the second set he looked like the player who has 
won here three times, diving after shots and sending rocket volleys into the 
corners to win, 6-7, 6-2, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Seles, the hottest player in tennis and the newly crowned French Open champion, 
overcame some second-set trouble to defeat American Camille Benjamin, 6-3, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin overpowered Seles at times with her serve-and-volley game but simply 
lacked the consistency to win. She led in the second set, 4-1, 40-0, but Seles, 
16, came back to wrap up her 34th consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth-seeded Zina Garrison of the United States also advanced. She beat Cecilia 
Dahlman of Sweden, 6-2, 6-1, losing just 14 points on her serve and winning the 
final six games after Dahlman broke for a 1-0 lead in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
Women's 10th seed Helena Sukova of Czechoslovakia won the last three games to 
beat Nicole Jagerman of the Netherlands, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Brad Gilbert, the seventh seed and the top American left in the men's field, 
beat Danie Visser of South Africa, 5-7, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Tenth-seeded Jonas Svensson of Sweden advanced with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 victory 
over Malaivi Washington of the United States, and 11th-seeded Guy Forget beat 
Eric Jelen of West Germany, 7-6, 6-7, 6-1, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
As this year's hopefuls were winning, a one-time contender played the final 
singles match of her career. 
</P>
<P>
Hana Mandlikova, a finalist here in 1981 and 1986, was eliminated by Ann 
Henricksson of the United States, 6-3, 6-3. Mandlikova said before the 
tournament that she would retire from singles play after Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt relieved and sad," Mandlikova said. "The only thing I'll ever regret is 
not winning here. It was my dream since childhood and I was in two finals. But 
I'll never have to be nervous or practice as hard as I always did." 
</P>
<P>
Becker had trouble keeping his feet on the slippery grass in his opening match 
Monday. He did better this time, going 29 minutes before taking his first roll 
as he chased down a backhand on the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
His serve was iffy in the first set. After staying on serve through the first 
12 games, Becker gave Masur two set points on a double fault, and the 
Australian closed it with a forehand cross-court volley. 
</P>
<P>
Becker got going in the second set. He saved four break points to go up 4-1, 
and closed a set of six service breaks with a passing shot down the line. 
</P>
<P>
That string of breaks continued when Becker went up 2-0 in the third set, then 
held for 3-0 on a drop shot. In the fourth set, the West German broke for 2-1 
and 4-1 and held for the match at love -- the last three points on two service 
winners and an ace. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe was joined on the sidelines by four other men's seeds, including fifth 
seed Andres Gomez and sixth seed Tom Mayotte. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, a clay-court specialist who won the French Open earlier this month, was 
sluggish in a 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 loss to American Jim Grabb. Mayotte, who usually is 
at his best on grass, lost to Gary Muller, 4-6, 7-6, 7-5, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Other seeds eliminated Tuesday were No. 12 Pete Sampras and No. 14 Petr Korda. 
Third seed Stefan Edberg and 13th seed Michael Chang each advanced in four 
sets. 
</P>
<P>
While American veterans McEnroe and Mayotte are out, the future looks bright 
for Seles and Jennifer Capriati. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati, 14, became the youngest winner in Wimbledon history by blasting 
Canada's Helen Kelesi, 6-3, 6-1, on Centre Court. She called it "a moment I'll 
never forget." 
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Seles, a Yugoslav who now lives in Florida, won the last 10 
games of her match against Maria Strandlund to win, 6-2, 6-0, in 51 minutes, 
overpowering the Swede with her two-fisted shots. 
</P>
<P>
The two women seeded above Seles, two-time defending champion Steffi Graf and 
eight-time winner Martina Navratilova, also had easy afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
Graf defeated fellow West German Claudia Porwik, 6-1, 6-2, in 51 minutes -- 
exactly the same time as Seles used -- while Navratilova was quickest of all. 
She defeated Sophie Amiach of France, 6-1, 6-1, in just 45 minutes.

Less than 24 hours after the worst incident involving English fans and Italian 
police during the World Cup, many of the 246 people sent home were claiming 
they were treated cruelly. 
</P>
<P>
One English fan, Bub Foreman, 27, said after arriving at Gatwick Airport on an 
airliner chartered by the Italian government to bring the expelled fans back to 
London that, "Three-quarters of the people on the plane were innocent and had 
nothing to do with any fighting. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just sitting in a bar when the trouble started and police piled in. They 
arrested anyone who spoke English, whether they had anything to do with the 
trouble or not. The police pushed us around and were very aggressive for no 
reason." 
</P>
<P>
The fans arrived late Tuesday night and were rushed onto a train to London 
without incident. A few had strong words about the way they were dealt with by 
the police in Rimini, where fighting between several hundred English and 
Italian fans led to rioting Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who started the fighting just disappeared before the police arrived 
and they rushed in and arrested anybody who was standing there," said Darren 
Gambia, another fan expelled from Italy. 
</P>
<P>
Added another fan, Michael Vincent, "When we were arrested we were held in a 
garage and treated very roughly. . . . We were punched and kicked by the police 
for no reason. I have never known anything like it and will never go back to 
Italy again. 
</P>
<P>
"Even on the plane (to Gatwick) they treated us like animals. We got one glass 
of water and were told to keep looking ahead and not to turn around to talk to 
anybody. Otherwise, you would get a smack across the head." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the fans came out of the airport terminal hiding their faces with 
shirts, soccer programs and even deportation papers as journalists and TV 
camera crews approached. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Taylor, who said he was among a group of English supporters who remained 
in a bar until 3 a.m. Tuesday after hearing that mobs of Italian supporters 
were on the streets looking for England fans, said Italian police grabbed 
English fans as they emerged from the bar. 
</P>
<P>
"The police came out of two cars with baseball bats and started knocking us 
around," he said. "It was quite frightening." 
</P>
<P>
The clashes were the worst involving English fans, who have a bad reputation 
for violence, since the World Cup in Italy began June 8. Riot police were 
called in to break up the violence. Shop windows were smashed and parked cars 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Some fans said England supporters in hotels where the British flag was on 
display were singled out for attack by Italians.

RACING Q &amp; A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE HIRSCH, DAILY RACING FORM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: "Do jockeys ride differently when their horses carry high weights in 
important stakes?" 
</P>
<P>
Answer: "Yes," says Hall of Fame jockey Angel Cordero Jr. "The rider is 
conscious of the weight and wants to avoid trouble if possible. When a horse is 
stopped by trouble under high weight, it is difficult to get him going again. 
Very often in this situation a rider is willing to lose ground in order to have 
a clear shot through the stretch. The idea is not to lose too much ground, but 
that is where judgment comes in." 
</P>
<P>
Q: "Why do they say that front-running horses are particularly affected by a 
tiring track when horses who come from behind are running on the same surface? 
Shouldn't they tire, too?" 
</P>
<P>
A: "Speed horses, racing in front, will struggle on a tiring track most of the 
time," veteran trainer Jimmy Picou says. "The struggle with track conditions 
will take something out of them. The speed horse wants to put his foot down on 
a firm surface and skip right along. Many stretch-runners have a more 
deliberate action and don't have to fight the track quite as hard as speed 
horses. Thus, though they are racing on the same surface, one is more affected 
than the other." 
</P>
<P>
Q: "Can you give me some idea of the earliest horse racing in the Midwest?" 
</P>
<P>
A: Do you consider Wheeling, W.Va., to be in the Midwest? If so, Wheeling had 
formal racing as early as 1808. There is reported to have been informal racing 
in the Lexington, Ky., area about 1800, similar racing in Tennessee as early as 
1815, and racing in the Chicago area about 1820. Racing has a long history in 
the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
Q: "Whenever I go to the track, I hear announcements about this jockey or that 
one being several pounds overweight. Is there a limit?" 
</P>
<P>
A: Under Jockey Club rules of racing, no horse may carry more than five pounds 
of overweight. However, the rule varies in certain jurisdictions. Ohio, for 
example, for some time, has permitted seven pounds of overweight in overnight 
events and 10 pounds in stakes.

Q: "I've seen many horses who appear to be easy winners of a race. Yet when 
they run back against basically the same company, they don't win. Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
A: "Very few horses are easy winners," trainer Nick Zito says. "A horse can win 
by a few lengths and may still have run hard at some point in the race so that 
he is not really the easy winner he seems. Some horses get brave on the lead. 
When they get away to a flying start and can breeze in front, they are easy 
winners. The next time they run there is some trouble away from the gate. They 
don't get the lead and it affects their performance." 
</P>
<P>
Q: "After major races, I've frequently read stories that quote trainers as 
saying their horse could not handle the track. This happens even when a track 
is not muddy. Why do some horses handle the track and others do not?" 
</P>
<P>
A: "Sometimes conformation will help one horse handle the track and will work 
to the disadvantage of another," Hall of Fame trainer Woody Stephens says. "A 
smaller horse lands easier and may be able to handle, for example, a deep 
track, while a big horse, who lands heavier, may go into the ground so far that 
it is a struggle for him to maintain his action. Not every small horse and not 
every big horse, but the majority. Let's discuss a horse's feet. If a horse has 
tender feet, and many do, a firm track may sting him to the point where he 
can't or won't do his best. He isn't handling the track. A soft track may suit 
him perfectly. Then there is a horse's stride. A long-striding horse doesn't 
usually care for a cuppy track. When he lands, the ground breaks out from under 
his feet and he doesn't have a sense of security. A short-striding horse has 
the better of it under those conditions." 
</P>
<P>
Q: "How long will an allowance horse hold his best form, in contrast to a horse 
of stakes caliber?" 
</P>
<P>
A: "Generally speaking, it is the individual horse, rather than the company he 
keeps, which is the determining factor in the matter of maintaining form," 
trainer Jimmy Picou says. "A light horse with a delicate constitution who 
cannot stand up under the strain of heavy racing is not likely to hold his best 
form very long, no matter whether he is a claimer or runs in allowance or 
stakes company. I have also seen claiming horses with robust constitutions who 
held their form through most of a season." 
</P>
<P>
Q: "Why is it that some jockeys seem especially skillful at getting a horse out 
of a starting gate quickly?" 
</P>
<P>
A: "Balance is a key factor," veteran horseman Phil Johnson says. "When the 
starting gate opens, some riders fall back in the saddle, tugging on the reins. 
Good gate riders, with balance, are poised for the movement of the horse 
springing forward so they can absorb the motion. It's somewhat like standing in 
a railroad car. Of course, some horses are faster out of the gate than others, 
and there is only so much a rider can do about that. But to the extent that the 
human element is involved, balance seems to be the governing factor." 
</P>
<P>
Q: "Harness horses warm up extensively before a race and seem to work more 
between races than thoroughbreds. Are they the sturdier breed?" 
</P>
<P>
A: "In my opinion the thoroughbred is sounder and sturdier than the 
Standardbred," says Dr. William O. Reed, a past president of the American Assn. 
of Equine Practitioners. "The reason harness horses score before a race is 
because many of them are not sound behind. They have to loosen up out of this 
unsoundness in order to race well. You see a number of trotters and pacers 
racing at ages 7, 8 and 9 and not as many thoroughbreds, but trotters and 
pacers are not generally raced as hard as thoroughbreds when they are 2, and 
this is why many of them last longer. It is also a physiological fact that 
thoroughbreds have denser bone than Standardbreds, and superior conformation. 
Thoroughbreds carry heavy weights and ship more than the average Standardbred. 
In my opinion, they are superior in every respect when it comes to wear and 
tear."

AFRICA WILL GET EXTRA SPOT IN '94 TOURNEY

Africa will get a third berth in the 1994 World Cup, at the expense of Europe, 
the head of soccer's ruling body said today. 
</P>
<P>
Joao Havelange, president of FIFA, credited Cameroon's success this summer for 
the change. 
</P>
<P>
"Africa will automatically get one more place," Havelange said in an interview 
published in La Gazzetta Dello Sport. "It deserves it. That place will be taken 
away from Europe." 
</P>
<P>
African nations had been calling for such a move well before the tournament and 
complained that Europe was over-represented at the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The North and Central American region and Asia will also get a chance to 
increase participation to three teams from two, but only through a special 
qualifying series with South American and European nations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
This could further weaken the presence of the traditional soccer bastions of 
Europe and South America, which have 18 of the 24 slots in this year's World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
After Roger Milla got two goals to put Cameroon in the World Cup quarterfinals, 
he said he wanted Africa to profit from his achievement. 
</P>
<P>
"It proves the progress of African soccer, and we have to work to get three 
places in the next World Cup," Milla said. 
</P>
<P>
FIFA has to make a final decision on the issue at a meeting in December.

SUPER-SUBS SURFACE TO MAKE WAVES IN WORLD CUP GAMES 
</P>

<P>
From a 38-year-old recently summoned out of retirement to a goalkeeper with one 
game of international experience, the World Cup has been a stage for substitute 
stars. 
</P>
<P>
Players coming off the bench have inspired their teams to great achievements. 
Depth has become so important that Argentina has used 22 players in its four 
games, including goalie Sergio Goycochea. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I look to the sky and I give credit to God," Goycochea says of his 
unexpectedly crucial role with the defending champions. "I am the backup for 
Pumpido, but if I have to play, I know my teammates have faith in me and I know 
I can justify all the faith people have shown in me." 
</P>
<P>
Goycochea has to play in this World Cup because Pumpido, who backstopped 
Argentina to the 1986 title, sustained a broken leg in the middle game of the 
opening round. 
</P>
<P>
The second-string goalie suddenly became No. 1, even though his only previous 
action on this level was in an exhibition against Italy in January. And 
Goycochea has responded well, although he did make several mistakes against 
Brazil, which either hit the goal post or crossbar or shot wide with him out of 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Goycochea had little hope of being with the national team after a shoulder 
injury sidelined him for seven months last season. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering that I had been injured," said the goalie for Millionarios in 
Colombia, "for me now to play on the national team is my reward." 
</P>
<P>
Also being rewarded by Coach Carlos Bilardo is Claudio Caniggia, a forward who 
has become a favorite of team captain and resident superstar Diego Maradona. 
Caniggia might not have been on the team if not for the insistence of Maradona 
and, of course, what Diego wants, Diego gets. 
</P>
<P>
So Caniggia made the squad. When the offense stalled against Cameroon in the 
tournament opener, Caniggia moved into the lineup. Argentina began playing 
better. 
</P>
<P>
Against Brazil, it was Caniggia who scored the only goal -- on a setup by 
Maradona, naturally. 
</P>
<P>
"Claudio scored the goal, Claudio deserves the credit," Maradona said of the 
23-year-old striker for Atalanta of the Italian League. "He has become a great 
player." 
</P>
<P>
Another substitute who seems headed for stardom is Italy's Salvatore Schillaci. 
The hosts have won four games and he has scored the winner in three of them. 
</P>
<P>
Schillaci began the tournament on the bench, playing behind Andrea Carnevale 
and Gianluca Vialli. His first international game was in March. 
</P>
<P>
But when he connected against Austria and Vialli and Carnevale did little 
against the United States, Schillaci moved into the starting lineup. He won't 
be moved out, at least not in this World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"He has done very well in creating scoring advantages for us," Italian coach 
Azeglio Vicini said. "He also has finished off some plays on his own." 
</P>
<P>
Two other Italian replacements have scored goals. Roberto Baggio got a superb 
one in a 2-0 victory over Czechoslovakia that clinched the Group A title, and 
Aldo Serena assisted on one and scored the other in a 2-0 second-round win 
against Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
Baggio has been considered one of Italy's brightest young stars. He played for 
Fiorentina last season and was the league's second leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
Then he was sold to Juventus, where Schillaci plays, and the 
multimillion-dollar deal angered fans in Florence. When Italy trained near 
Florence before the tournament, Baggio was whistled at and yelled at by fans. 
</P>
<P>
But his play for the national team should quiet those critics. 
</P>
<P>
Two teams from the United Kingdom, England and Ireland, have made the 
quarterfinals with great help from benchwarmers. 
</P>
<P>
The English have yet to display much offense in the World Cup, but their 
biggest goal, in the final minute of overtime against Belgium, got them into 
the final eight. It came off the foot of David Platt, who was on the field 
mainly because team captain Bryan Robson is back home with a foot injury. 
</P>
<P>
Platt scored one of the nicest goals of the tournament, volleying a free kick 
from Paul Gascoigne while turning. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just an instinctive thing," said Platt, 24. "If I had let the ball 
bounce, it was going to get away." 
</P>
<P>
Ireland found its way into the quarters with the assistance of subs Niall 
Quinn, whose goal against the Netherlands got the Irish into the second round, 
and David O'Leary. It was the 32-year-old O'Leary who came off the bench and 
put in the winning penalty kick in a shoot-out with Romania. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't be happier for David," coach Jack Charlton said. "He has waited so 
long for this." 
</P>
<P>
The man who has waited longest for World Cup glory is Roger Milla. He was with 
Cameroon in 1982, when it tied three first-round games and was eliminated on 
tiebreakers. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Milla played in France, then went into retirement from the 
professional ranks, moving to an amateur team on the island of Reunion. 
</P>
<P>
But he was summoned back to the team for this World Cup and, usually coming on 
for the second half, has four goals. He personally beat Romania in the opening 
round and Colombia in the second phase. 
</P>
<P>
Does that mean Milla will follow Schillaci's path into the starting lineup? Not 
likely. At 38, he is most effective being used sparingly. 
</P>
<P>
Like most supersubs.

The California Highway Patrol was trying to identify a pedestrian who remained 
in critical condition today after he was struck by a car when he attempted to 
cross the west Riverside Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The man was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange after the accident, about 
10:40 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Angel Johnson said the man was seen walking in the center divider 
west of Raymond Avenue in Anaheim before he stepped into the fast lane. 
</P>
<P>
A 39-year-old Yorba Linda woman swerved but could not avoid striking the 
pedestrian, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Another vehicle then rear-ended the Yorba Linda motorist and sped off. Johnson 
said investigators were seeking information from the public on the hit-and-run 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
The pedestrian suffered a broken pelvis and head, chest and other internal 
injuries.

MERCURY HITS 107 BY NOONTIME

Temperatures soared well past the 100-degree-mark and headed toward another 
all-time record this afternoon as Southern Californians suffered through the 
second day of a searing heat wave that is expected to last through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The mercury was continuing to rise after reaching 107 at the Los Angeles Civic 
Center at noon today. That was just five degrees short of the all-time record 
for any date, set Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures in Orange County were generally a few degrees lower but were also 
on the rise and appeared headed toward another record number as of mid-day. El 
Toro led the way with a high reading of 97 degrees around noon. 
</P>
<P>
The crippling heat wave has been blamed for at least one death here -- that of 
a 4-year-old boy who succumbed to heat exhaustion Tuesday after being 
accidentally locked in a parked car. Three others apparently died from the heat 
in Phoenix, where temperatures topped out at 122 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Southland residents headed this morning for area 
beaches, where temperatures were as much as 30 degrees cooler than communities 
a few miles inland. 
</P>
<P>
Morning temperatures in Huntington Beach, for instance, logged in at a 
comfortable 68, with Newport Beach reporting 67. 
</P>
<P>
Power usage reached record levels as hundreds of thousands of folks who had to 
stay indoors turned up their air conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
But for many, there was no escape. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible!" said auto mechanic Elmo Stewart, 47, as he sweltered over a 
Subaru at a small, air-conditionless repair shop in Canoga Park, where the 
inside temperature had topped 102 by mid-morning. 
</P>
<P>
"It got bad pretty fast, today," Stewart said. "By 9:30 a.m., I was pretty well 
drained. I picked the wrong kind of job. Let me tell you!" 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol officers reported a rash of overheated cars that 
slowed Orange County freeways, and they warned motorists to avoid using air 
conditioners in stop-and-go traffic and check the coolant in radiators. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's downtown Los Angeles high -- 112 degrees -- smashed a 107-year-old 
record for the date by 14 degrees and was the hottest temperature recorded here 
since the National Weather Service started keeping records, 97 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The 112-degree reading came at about 5 p.m., when the thermometer jumped five 
degrees in a few minutes as gusting Santa Ana winds pulled superheated air from 
aloft down to ground level, where the Weather Service's instruments are 
located. 
</P>
<P>
The mercury hovered for most of the night at a sweltering 92 degrees before 
finally dipping to 87 at about 7 a.m. That would be the all-time record for the 
warmest minimum reading if the Civic Center thermometer doesn't drop below that 
by midnight tonight. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't take long for things to start heating up again this morning. By 8 
a.m. it was 94 degrees. By 9 a.m. -- the peak of the morning rush hour -- it 
was 100. 
</P>
<P>
As they had the evening before, cars started overheating and pulling to the 
shoulder of the area's freeways during the morning commute and the Southern 
California Rapid Transit District reported a surge in bus breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
In one of their cruellest advisories ever, the California Highway Patrol 
suggested that motorists turn off their air conditioners, and even turn on 
their heaters, if their cars began to overheat. Mechanics explained that 
air-conditioners tend to make engines run extra hot, and that turning on your 
car's heater draws heat from the engine. 
</P>
<P>
Overheated RTD buses were coasting to a halt throughout the county, causing 
sweaty delays for passengers who, in some cases, were forced to wait by the 
curb while drivers tried running the heaters. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it 
didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Passengers are going to have to take it in stride," said RTD spokesman Rick 
Jager.

JACK LOHRKE, WHOSE BASEBALL CAREER INCLUDED A TOUR WITH THE OLD PADRES, HAS HAD 
A WAY OF BEING IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT A TERRIBLE TIME

<P>
They call him Lucky, and never in the history of baseball has a nickname been 
more appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Lohrke, who played for the minor league Padres and then spent seven 
seasons in the majors, insists today that the series of near misses he went 
through was no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
But the facts say otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this log of Lohrke's good fortune: 
</P>
<P>
In 1944, as a member of the 35th Infantry Division during World War II, Lohrke 
participated in the Normandy invasion and the Battle of the Bulge. On four 
occasions, soldiers on both sides of him were killed, yet he never got a 
scratch. 
</P>
<P>
In 1945, he was scheduled to fly from Fort Dix, N.J., to Los Angeles to be 
discharged Nov. 6, but was bumped from the flight -- "for some big shot," as he 
put it -- just before takeoff. The plane crashed 45 minutes later, and everyone 
aboard was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Then the topper: 
</P>
<P>
In 1946 -- on June 24 -- Lohrke was on a bus trip with the Spokane Indians of 
the old Western International League, en route from Spokane to Bremerton, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
Lohrke was hitting .345 as the Indians' third baseman, and when the bus made a 
restaurant stop in Ellensburg, Wash., he received a message to report 
immediately to the Padres, who had recalled him to the Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterward, the bus careened off a cliff in the Cascade Mountains, and 
nine of the 15 players aboard were killed. 
</P>
<P>
From that time on, it was Lucky Lohrke, and that's the way he is still 
remembered by baseball fans of two generations ago. Besides fitting the 
circumstances to a T, the moniker is perfectly alliterative. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Lohrke, now 65, won't admit to being impressed by his run of luck. He 
lives in San Jose and is retired from his job at the Lockheed Missile and Space 
Co. in Sunnyvale. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never been unlucky, that's all," he said. "When I got married, that was 
pure luck. My wife, Marie, and I have been married 41 years now, and we have 
six children ranging in age from 26 to 40." 
</P>
<P>
Lohrke even sees a positive side to his demotion to the Hollywood Stars of the 
PCL after five seasons with the Giants, then in New York, and two with the 
Philadelphia Phillies. In January, 1954, he was traded by the Phillies to the 
Pittsburgh Pirates, who cut him before the season opened. 
</P>
<P>
"I might have been sent to Wilkes-Barre," he said. "There's nothing wrong with 
Wilkes-Barre, but it's not California." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, being assigned to Hollywood by the Pirates meant that Lohrke was 
going home. He was born in Los Angeles and attended South Gate High School. 
</P>
<P>
You might think that a player named Lucky would have been given uniform No. 7 
somewhere along the way, but Lohrke said, "I never wore 7. I wore 17 with the 
Giants, but that was as close as I got." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the fact that Lohrke was accustomed to being lucky, he says his war 
experience had conditioned him to the Spokane disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"At that age, having been in combat, what's going to shock you?" he asked. "I'm 
a fatalist. I believe the old song, that whatever will be will be." 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that Lohrke was unshaken by what happened to nine of his 
teammates in the crash. Among the dead were his roommates, second baseman Fred 
Martinez and outfielder Bob James. 
</P>
<P>
"When the bus took off from Ellensburg, I bummed a ride back to Spokane," 
Lohrke said. "When I got there, I found out both of my roommates had been 
killed. Martinez was from the San Diego area, and a week later, I met his 
widow. That was something else. 
</P>
<P>
"I stayed in Spokane a day or so, and then I took Vic Picetti's widow back to 
San Francisco. It was very sad. 
</P>
<P>
"After that, I went to Los Angeles and stayed overnight with my mom and dad. 
When I arrived in San Diego, Bill Starr (the Padres' owner) chewed me out for 
being a couple of days late. He asked me, 'Where have you been?' I said, 'I've 
been delivering widows.' He said, 'Oh, I'm sorry,' and I got right into the 
lineup." 
</P>
<P>
Lohrke recalled that the first thing he did when he learned of the accident was 
to let his parents know he was all right. 
</P>
<P>
"I went right to the telegraph office in Spokane," he said. "I remember the 
words to this day: 'Safe and sound. Back in Spokane. Love, Jack.' They didn't 
know what I was wiring them about until they read the morning paper." 
</P>
<P>
Two other members of Spokane's 18-man squad missed the fatal bus ride. Pitchers 
Milt Cadinha and Joe Faria made the trip by car. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the severity of the accident, it was miraculous that six players 
and the driver survived. It was raining at the time, and when the bus veered to 
avoid an oncoming car, it skidded through a guard rail and caught fire. It came 
to rest 350 feet below, a total wreck. 
</P>
<P>
Lohrke noted that Martinez and Picetti, the latter a first baseman, were 
outstanding major league prospects. 
</P>
<P>
"They were natural hitters," Lohrke said. "Picetti was only 19 years old." 
</P>
<P>
The list of victims also included the Indians' playing manager, catcher Mel 
Cole. Glenn Wright, a longtime major league shortstop, had preceded Cole, and 
his firing early in the season has to rank with the most fortuitous of all 
time. He lived to be 83 before dying in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Two members of the team had played in the majors earlier in their careers. 
Catcher Chris Hartje, who had been with the then Brooklyn Dodgers in 1939, died 
of injuries two days after the crash. Infielder Ben Geraghty, who had been with 
the Dodgers in 1936 and the Boston Braves in 1943 and 1944, was seriously hurt 
but recovered. He died in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
"The ones who lived got thrown out through windows," Lohrke said. "They were 
all injured, some pretty badly." 
</P>
<P>
With the Padres, Lohrke quickly became a favorite of fans at old Lane Field, 
located at the foot of Broadway between Pacific Highway and a parking lot that 
is now part of Harbor Drive. Switched to shortstop because 38-year-old Dick 
Gyselman was still going strong at third, Lohrke hit .303 in 92 games and 
earned a promotion to the majors at season's end. 
</P>
<P>
"When I joined the Padres, Gyselman was one of the first guys I talked to," 
Lohrke said. "He had been up with the Braves long before that (in 1933 and 
1934). He said to me, 'I don't know where you're playing, son, but I'm playing 
third base.' 
</P>
<P>
"Jack Calvey had been the shortstop, but Pepper Martin, who was our manager, 
put me out there, and I got off to a good start. Martin was from the old 
school. He just wanted you to hustle." 
</P>
<P>
Of playing at Lane Field, Lohrke said, "If you could hit there, you could hit 
anyplace. They had bathtub lights in that park. The only thing you were sure of 
was that you were going to play. Compared to the lights in L.A. (at old Wrigley 
Field), you would have thought you were in another league." 
</P>
<P>
Lohrke had joined the Padres out of high school in 1942 but played in only 
seven games before being sent to Twin Falls of the Pioneer League, where he hit 
.271. After three years in the Army, he was ready for the majors, and the route 
he took to get there was a story in itself. 
</P>
<P>
Starr, who had bought the Padres in 1945 after a playing career that included 
stints as a catcher with them and the Washington Senators, knew he had to make 
a deal, because if he didn't, Lohrke would be taken in the major league draft. 
He thought he had traded Lohrke to the Braves for four players and $50,000 but 
wound up losing him to the Giants for $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the saddest experiences of my baseball career," said Starr, who 
still lives in San Diego. "There was no doubt in my mind that the deal would go 
through. When it didn't, I was criticized in the press for letting Lohrke get 
drafted, but I had to take the consequences." 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the projected trade with the Braves, outfielder Johnny Barrett 
was to report to the Padres immediately, and a pitcher, shortstop and 
outfielder were to follow as soon as they cleared waivers. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett became a Padre on schedule, but none of the others, whom Starr declined 
to identify, ever did. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the deal fell through because the Braves didn't obtain waivers on 
the three unnamed players before the draft. With Lohrke thus remaining on the 
Padres' roster and becoming vulnerable to the draft, he was snapped up by the 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Giants took him, I was devastated," Starr said. "We would have gotten 
three very important players, plus some very important money, and the Braves 
had said they guaranteed delivery. I think they could have gotten waivers in 
time, or if they couldn't, that they could have adjusted the deal somehow. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the only time in all my baseball experience that anybody in baseball 
reneged on me." 
</P>
<P>
Lohrke discussed his confusion about all this. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a notice from the Braves to report to spring training in Bradenton, 
Fla.," he said. "Then, whoops, it's the Giants. I had to look up what league 
they were in. Is that dumb, or what? I didn't know the difference." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Lohrke never made it big in the majors. He hit only .240 and 
.250 with the Giants in 1947 and 1948, spent part of 1949 at Jersey City on 
option, and after being recalled, played out his big league career in a utility 
role. His lifetime average was .242, with a high of .267 in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
But Lohrke did experience the thrill of playing in a World Series, 
pinch-hitting twice for the Giants in 1951. He popped out and struck out. 
</P>
<P>
After his return to the PCL in 1954, Lohrke stayed with Hollywood for two 
seasons, then played two with Seattle and one with Portland before retiring in 
1958. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I could have had a better career than I did," Lohrke said. "I was 
playing third base every day with the Giants until they got Hank Thompson and 
Monte Irvin in '49. That's when Leo Durocher made me a utility man, and that 
hurt me. My hands were tied from then on." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Lohrke cherishes many a memory from his playing days, not only as a 
major leaguer but as a Padre. 
</P>
<P>
"When I joined the Padres, I was in awe of everything," he said. "We'd take 
trains and spend a week here and a week there. It was great. I thought I was in 
the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"When I did get to the big leagues, I was really in awe. I'd only played a 
couple of years of ball, and I didn't own a suit or a sport coat. There was a 
knock on my door, and a little short guy with glasses was there. He said, 'Glad 
to meet you. I'm Mel Ott, the manager.' I was flabbergasted. He hit over 500 
home runs (511), and he's in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"He took me in to see Carl Hubbell (another Hall of Famer) to negotiate my 
contract, and we had a big meeting with dinner. Now guys have agents 
negotiating for millions, and they haven't got a base hit yet." 
</P>
<P>
Lohrke hit a career-high 11 home runs as a Giant rookie in 1947, and two of 
them were memorable. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit the Giants' 182nd home run of the season, which tied the (Yankees') 
record," he said. "Then I hit the 183rd, which broke it. We went on to set a 
record of 221." 
</P>
<P>
Lohrke was still with the Giants when a future Hall of Famer named Willie Mays 
joined them in 1951. 
</P>
<P>
"He started out 0 for 16, but you could see he was a hell of a ballplayer," 
Lohrke said. "He could have played shortstop, anything. He could have even been 
a pitcher, with his natural ability. His hands were twice as big as mine." 
</P>
<P>
As for Spokane, there are times when Lohrke goes back to renew sad memories. 
</P>
<P>
"Every once in a while, they call me for Spokane Indian Day," he said. "The old 
ballplayers come, and we talk about the guys who didn't make it and how 
fortunate we are." 
</P>
<P>
Especially Lucky Lohrke.

REVELLE TO RECEIVE NATIONAL MEDAL OF SCIENCE 
</P>

<P>
Roger Revelle, a UC San Diego founder and one of the originators of the idea of 
a global greenhouse effect, has been selected to receive the National Medal of 
Science. 
</P>
<P>
Revelle, 81, said his notification of the award told him he was being honored 
for his work in oceanographic exploration, atmospheric science and population 
biology. 
</P>
<P>
Revelle was one of five graduate students at Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography in 1936, when it began moving from coastal studies to long 
scientific voyages on ships at sea. 
</P>
<P>
He became director of the institution from 1950 to 1964, and during that period 
became one of the strongest lobbyists before the Board of Regents for 
establishing a UC campus in San Diego. Later, he founded and headed the Harvard 
Center for Population Studies until returning to UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
He is now director emeritus of Scripps and a professor of public policy at 
UCSD. He has been ill since February, however, when he had cardiac surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Three decades ago Revelle and Hans Suess, now a UCSD professor emeritus of 
chemistry, wrote a paper about what Revelle calls "mankind's great geophysical 
experiment." They theorized that increasing amounts of carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere might heat up the globe by trapping the sun's energy in a 
"greenhouse effect." 
</P>
<P>
The National Medal of Science will be presented by President Bush sometime 
later this summer. It is awarded to scientists nominated for presidential 
approval by a special committee of the National Science Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Revelle will become the fifth UCSD faculty member to receive the government's 
highest scientific award. 
</P>
<P>
Others at UCSD who have received the medal are oceanographer Walter Munk; 
astronomer Margaret Burbidge; mathematician Michael Freedman and cell biologist 
and Nobel Prize winner George E. Palade, dean of scientific affairs in the UCSD 
School of Medicine.

THIS HARD-LINE NEGOTIATOR SPEAKS LANGUAGE OF TRADE 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He speaks Japanese skillfully, eats sushi with his fingers -- "the way you're 
supposed to" -- and is fascinated by the Orient. At home, his living room is 
filled with Japanese paintings and red lacquer storage chests. 
</P>
<P>
Yet no one has ever branded Joseph A. Massey a member of the Chrysanthemum Club 
-- the epithet that Japan's Washington critics have coined for government 
officials who "go easy" on Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
To the contrary, Massey, an assistant U.S. trade representative and one of the 
government's most experienced trade negotiators, is known as a "hawk" -- 
aggressive, openly skeptical and intent on closing every loophole in dealing 
with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
And over the past few weeks, Massey, a 49-year-old former professor with a 
graying, well-trimmed beard and an occasional wry smile, has been involved in 
crucial negotiations over how to resolve key trade disputes with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"You would not call Joe a dove," says Clyde Prestowitz, a onetime Commerce 
Department trade official and the author of "Trading Places," a book that 
criticizes U.S. trade policy toward Japan. "That doesn't mean he's unreasonable 
-- but he is a firm negotiator." 
</P>
<P>
Under the 1988 Trade Act, the Administration has completed negotiations it 
began last year to open Japan's market to more supercomputers, satellites and 
wood products. Broader economic talks aimed at helping U.S. businesses operate 
more successfully there are going on this week in Tokyo, with Massey part of 
the U.S. negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
"To get real access to the Japanese market means it has to operate the way 
other markets do," Massey says. "And that's going to take a substantial reform 
in how the Japanese do business." At present, Japanese markets are dominated by 
interlocking business relationships that too often tend to shut out newcomers, 
particularly foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
When Massey joined the government in 1982, he was virtually the only key U.S. 
trade representative official who was able to speak Japanese or was a 
specialist in U.S. trade frictions with Tokyo. The Commerce Department had one 
such specialist, the State Department a few more. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the U.S. trade representative's office has some half a dozen officials 
and staffers who have experience in Japan, including S. Linn Williams, a deputy 
to Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills and Massey's boss. And Massey is 
now one of three who speak Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
To his delight, the United States' approach to U.S.-Japanese trade negotiations 
also has changed dramatically, particularly since last July, when the Bush 
Administration began its broad-scale Structural Impediments Initiative talks 
with Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Massey's tenure, Washington believed that broad economic factors 
would correct any trade problems with Japan. U.S. negotiators worried mostly 
about tariffs and quotas, removal of which turned out to have relatively little 
impact on trade patterns. 
</P>
<P>
But today -- largely because of rising U.S.-Japan trade tensions -- Tokyo has 
become the major focus of U.S. trade policy, and the Bush Administration has 
been seeking not just to reduce tariffs there but to alter the fundamental way 
that Japan does business. 
</P>
<P>
Although Massey was not directly involved in the SII talks -- Williams has been 
the U.S. trade representative's key negotiator in those -- he has participated 
in virtually all U.S. trade negotiations with Japan since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"We're now moving into a new phase with the Japanese in which we are dealing 
with important issues that simply couldn't be addressed" under the previous, 
narrower negotiating format. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Villanova, Pa., Massey earned a doctorate in political science from 
Yale University, taught U.S.-Japanese relations at Dartmouth for a decade and 
spent two years at a Boston-based consulting firm. His service here includes a 
year on the White House staff. 
</P>
<P>
He has lived in Japan, on and off, for six years. An amateur bird-watcher, he 
combined the two passions in 1982 to write "A Field Guide to the Birds of 
Japan" -- a book that describes winged creatures in the Japanese islands, not 
fellow trade negotiators he has met. 
</P>
<P>
Massey's trade "credits" include some of the most contentious negotiations the 
two nations have undertaken -- aimed at lifting Japanese trade barriers on 
beef, citrus, tobacco, telecommunications equipment and, more recently, 
supercomputers and satellites. 
</P>
<P>
His most memorable experience was in 1986, during wrangling over an accord 
involving semiconductors. After round-the-clock bargaining for four days, U.S. 
officials staged an eleventh-hour walkout that left their Japanese counterparts 
taken aback -- and ready to give in. 
</P>
<P>
The semiconductor agreement that was supposed to open new opportunities for 
U.S. manufacturers and stop Japan from predatory pricing "has done a poor job," 
he says, "but it taught us a lot." 
</P>
<P>
In terms of the over-all conduct of trade negotiations with Japan, says 
Prestowitz: "The discussion is carried on at a much more sophisticated level 
now, and I think Joe has had something to do with that. He has had an impact."
