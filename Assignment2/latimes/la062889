CONVICTION OF NOFZIGER VOIDED BY SINGLE WORD

<P>
A federal appeals court, bitterly divided over the use of a key adverb in an 
ethics law, Tuesday reversed the conviction of former White House aide Lyn 
Nofziger on charges that he illegally lobbied former colleagues on behalf of 
private clients. 
</P>
<P>
The panel ruled, 2 to 1, that a special prosecutor had failed to prove that 
Nofziger "knowingly" violated a one-year ban on senior government officials' 
lobbying their former agencies. 
</P>
<P>
In a dissent, Judge Harry T. Edwards argued that no such proof was required 
because the adverb -- buried in a long, tortuously constructed sentence in the 
statute -- did not apply in Nofziger's case. Edwards charged that Judges James 
L. Buckley and Stephen F. Williams had "labored mightily to find an ambiguity" 
that does not exist. 
</P>
<P>
Nofziger, who was former President Ronald Reagan's political director before 
becoming a lobbyist in 1982, was convicted last year on three felony counts in 
the first major test of the 1978 Ethics in Government Act. 
</P>
<P>
A jury found him guilty of illegally lobbying former White House colleagues on 
behalf of a labor union and two defense contractors, including the 
scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp. 
</P>
<P>
A "very pleased" Nofziger said at a news conference Tuesday that the ruling 
vindicated his previously undisclosed request that Reagan not grant him a 
pardon on leaving office last January. 
</P>
<P>
Nofziger said that he had also been proven right in refusing to express remorse 
before U.S. District Judge Thomas A. Flannery, who fined him $30,000 and 
sentenced him to 90 days in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"I believed that I was innocent, completely innocent," said Nofziger, 64, 
characteristically sporting a tie depicting Mickey Mouse in an Uncle Sam suit. 
</P>
<P>
Independent counsel James C. McKay, who charged that Nofziger had "cashed in" 
on his White House influence, said in a statement that he was studying various 
options for appeal. Sources said that McKay probably would ask for a rehearing 
by the entire 11-member U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by the three-member panel turned on whether the ethics law 
required that prosecutors prove Nofziger had acted "knowingly" as well as "with 
intent to influence" when he lobbied his former colleagues at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
There are two elements to the lobbying offense -- making an "appearance" and 
making a "communication" on behalf of a client. The court majority agreed with 
Nofziger that "knowingly" leaped over various commas and subordinate clauses to 
modify key verbs in each element. Edwards argued that it applied to only one 
element, "appearance," which the indictment did not cover. 
</P>
<P>
"We interpret" the law "as requiring the government to demonstrate that 
Nofziger had knowledge of the facts that made his conduct criminal," said 
Buckley, writing for the majority in a 28-page exposition of grammatical and 
legal fine points. 
</P>
<P>
In an equally technical 12-page retort, Edwards said: "I cannot comprehend my 
colleagues' convoluted attempts to embrace the appellant's fancied ambiguity 
and their concomitant willingness to ignore clear legislative history and 
engage in overt legislating." 
</P>
<P>
One of the counts against Nofziger charged that, shortly after leaving the 
White House, he improperly lobbied then-presidential counselor Edwin Meese III 
on a $32-million Army contract for Wedtech to build small engines. It 
eventually was awarded to the Bronx company over the Army's objections about 
the price. 
</P>
<P>
The ethics law prohibits former officials such as Nofziger from lobbying 
ex-colleagues for one year on matters of "direct and substantial interest" to 
their former agencies. The prosecutors never alleged that Nofziger knew his 
former colleagues had a direct and substantial interest in the matters on which 
he was lobbying them. 
</P>
<P>
Another count involved contacts that Nofziger made on behalf of the Marine 
Engineers Beneficial Assn., a labor union. He urged a Meese deputy, James E. 
Jenkins, to support increased use of civilian sailors on Navy ships. Reagan 
later approved the policy, and Nofziger was paid $100,000 by the union. 
</P>
<P>
The third count involved representation of Fairchild Republic Corp. Nofziger 
lobbied two National Security Council aides on continued funding for the A-10 
warplane manufactured by the company. The Pentagon soon freed $50 million to 
keep production alive for several months. Nofziger and a foundation he ran 
received $75,000 for the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Nofziger said that he had spent more than $1.5 million in legal fees and lost 
at least that much in business since his indictment and conviction. But the 
former Reagan aide said that he thought he had been able to retain his good 
name with many people. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the people who have known me in this town over the years respect me 
and have continued to respect me," he said.

WASTE WATER AT HYPERION NOW CLEANER THAN EVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles' Hyperion sewage treatment plant, which has missed repeated 
deadlines to comply with federal clean water rules, is discharging the cleanest 
waste water ever into Santa Monica Bay and has met an important federal 
pollution standard nine years ahead of schedule, city officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In May and most of April, waste water from the plant discharged five miles 
offshore from El Segundo contained a daily average of 29.7 milligrams of 
suspended solids per liter, the officials said. Under an agreement reached 
between the city and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the level of 
suspended solids must not average more than 30 milligrams per liter by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of suspended solids in waste water is considered a key measure of 
its cleanliness. In early 1986, when the city settled a decade-old lawsuit by 
the EPA over the dumping of sewage into the bay, levels were as high as 110 
milligrams per liter. The city is currently required to maintain an average of 
no more than 95 milligrams per liter, a standard that is scheduled to drop to 
70 milligrams in two years. 
</P>
<P>
"They are certainly doing better than we thought they could do," said Lois 
Grunwald, a spokeswoman for the EPA. "And we are very happy about it." 
</P>
<P>
John Crosse, Hyperion's operations manager, said: "What we have is pretty 
sparkling clean water. "If you hold it up in the light next to a glass of 
drinking water, it is pretty hard to tell the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Although preliminary data for this month shows the daily average edging toward 
32 milligrams per liter, Hyperion officials said the increase is not 
significant, and they predicted that the levels will hover around the 1998 
standard indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Green, president of Heal the Bay, an environmental group that has been 
monitoring the city's agreement with the EPA, said the success in cleaning 
Hyperion's waste water has astounded even its harshest critics. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has been totally amazed, surprised and delighted at what they have 
been able to accomplish," Green said. "They have been doing one hell of a job 
over there." 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected improvement in the quality of waste water has been traced to 
three factors: the use of new chemicals during primary treatment of sewage, an 
improved aeration system during secondary treatment, and a reduced flow of 
sewage to the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Crosse said the chemicals have helped pull solid waste out of the water by 
attaching themselves to suspended solids and quickly settling to the bottom of 
tanks, where the material can be removed. Before the use of the chemicals, he 
said, the plant was capturing 60% of the suspended solids. With the chemicals, 
the plant collects about 80%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, about half of the sewage in the plant now passes through a more 
efficient aeration system. The process, part of what is known as secondary 
treatment, provides oxygen for bacteria, which remove suspended solids bypassed 
during the chemical treatment. Last year, only 35% of the sewage received 
secondary treatment. The city is required to provide 100% secondary treatment 
by 1998 under the agreement with the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
The treatment process has also been assisted by a reduction in the amount of 
sewage passing through Hyperion, which comes from Los Angeles and eight other 
cities. In 1985, the plant was averaging 420 million gallons per day, about 50 
million gallons more than today. City officials attribute the reduction to the 
diversion of sewage to the the city's Tillman plant in Van Nuys. Once new 
construction at the Hyperion plant is finished in 1998, it will be able to 
handle about 550 million gallons per day. 
</P>
<P>
"The less flow we receive at Hyperion, the better job we can do," Crosse said. 
"We have more time to remove the solids. The more time you have, the better 
chance you have of capturing the solids." 
</P>
<P>
The state regional Water Quality Control Board, which supported the EPA in its 
suit and for years hounded the city to improve its waste water treatment, 
praised the city for its progress in treating suspended solids but cautioned 
that the city has not solved all of its sewage treatment woes. 
</P>
<P>
David Gildersleeve, chief of the board's regulatory section, said the city must 
still complete construction of its secondary treatment facilities at Hyperion, 
and he said the city is also well above the federal standard for BOD, the 
biological oxygen demand of waste water. BOD is a measure of how much oxygen 
bacteria in waste water must steal from seawater in order to oxidize the 
remaining material in the waste water. The waste water from Hyperion has 
required an average of 85 to 90 milligrams of oxygen per liter, which is well 
below the 1991 standard of 195 milligrams per liter set for Hyperion in the EPA 
agreement but above the 1998 standard of 30 milligrams per liter. 
</P>
<P>
The BOD level is important because oxygen stolen by bacteria in waste water is 
no longer available for fish and other marine life. City officials said they 
were pleased to have already met the 1991 standard, but said they did not 
expect to meet the 1998 standard until the secondary treatment facilities are 
finished that year. Crosse said he hopes that Hyperion's improved record in 
cleaning its waste water will ease public concern about pollution from the 
plant. For years, the plant has been synonymous with the city's sewage crisis, 
in part because it dumped millions of gallons of sludge a day into the bay 
until it was forced by the EPA to stop in 1987. The city agreed to pay a 
$625,000 fine for Clean Water Act violations when it settled its dispute with 
EPA. "We have worked our tails off to achieve this," Crosse said. "We hope the 
public gets the message and starts using the beaches more." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, public use of beaches in Los Angeles County has been well 
below record levels of the early 1980s, although there is no evidence that 
people have been avoiding the beaches because of concerns about Hyperion. 
Attendance has been gradually increasing since bottoming out in 1986, and 
county officials say beach-goers probably care more about the weather than 
pollution from Hyperion.

PREMIER BOWS TO SOVIET ASSEMBLY ON HIS NOMINEES 
</P>

<P>
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, bowing to the authority of the Soviet Union's newly 
strengthened legislature, withdrew six of his ministerial nominees Tuesday 
after they had been rejected by the committees of lawmakers that had examined 
their qualifications and proposed programs. 
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov, speaking with reporters after the session of the Supreme Soviet, said 
that he could not defend these nominees and would propose others in their 
places. 
</P>
<P>
"I agreed actually with the conclusions of the parliamentary committees," he 
said. "I could not see any substantial proof that would enable me to defend 
them." 
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that the country's elected representatives had 
scrutinized prospective ministers with any vigor, and their success in forcing 
Ryzhkov to withdraw his nomination of the six they consider unqualified was an 
important precedent in establishing the Supreme Soviet's authority over the 
executive branch of the government. 
</P>
<P>
Those rejected included the proposed chairman of the State Bank of the Soviet 
Union, the longtime chairman of the State Committee on Physical Culture and 
Sports, the current minister of culture and nominees to head the Oil and Gas 
Ministry, the Water Resources Ministry and the State Prices Committee. 
</P>
<P>
They had been attacked as unskilled in their jobs, politically insensitive and 
bureaucratic in style. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, two other nominees -- one who would have been the first deputy 
premier responsible for agriculture and the other who would have headed the 
Machine Tool and Instrument Ministry -- withdrew their names in anticipation of 
defeat. A third, the chairman of the state ecology commission, refused even to 
accept the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
These were already among the country's most powerful men, and their 
unprecedented defeat underscores the fundamental political shifts now under way 
here. 
</P>
<P>
The whole process of legislative hearings on their qualifications and proposed 
programs is also seen as a major step to raise the competency of top government 
officials and to make them answerable for their policies to the Supreme Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not say that they were bad specialists or incompetent," Ryzhkov said 
of those who were rejected. "They simply did not meet demands in one area or 
another. Now, we have to think about new candidates." 
</P>
<P>
Leonid I. Abalkin, an influential economist who was named deputy premier for 
economic policy, supported Ryzhkov's action. "The decision to withdraw was 
right for all six candidates," he said after the session. "These were not the 
best people he could have chosen." 
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov had said late last week that he would fight for several of the nominees 
who, he asserted, had been the "victims of emotions" during the often heated 
committee debates. But in the end he apparently decided to avoid what would 
have been a bruising political battle and to establish a working relationship 
with the Supreme Soviet. 
</P>
<P>
He went further during the day's debate and pledged to support new legislation 
that would provide for an annual no-confidence debate, a feature of many 
Western parliaments, in order to provide a regular review of the government's 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
With that, the Supreme Soviet approved the balance of Ryzhkov's 70-member 
Cabinet, more than half of whom oversee sectors of the Soviet Union's 
state-owned, state-run economy. 
</P>
<P>
Now a full-time legislature with broad powers and no longer a "rubber stamp" 
for ratifying Communist Party decisions, the Supreme Soviet is made up of two 
houses with a total of 542 members elected from the larger Congress of People's 
Deputies, which was given "supreme state authority" under President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's political reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The new ministers will be paid the equivalent of $1,230 a month, about four 
times the average Soviet wage, Ryzhkov told deputies, but they could earn up to 
50% more with bonuses through meeting performance goals. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet is scheduled to meet until early August with a 21-point 
agenda that includes new laws on consumer protection, inventions, court reform, 
the press, taxes, revision of the criminal code and other measures.

SOVIETS HINT DEFECTOR WAS KGB PLANT IN U.S. 
</P>

<P>
The Soviet Union said Tuesday that a U.S. Navy intelligence specialist who was 
granted asylum here last year as a "defector" fleeing political persecution in 
the United States had actually been a longtime Soviet spy -- and suggested that 
he may even have been sent to America as a Russian infiltrator while still a 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
Announcing the "sudden death" of Glenn Michael Souther at the age of 32, an 
official obituary in the Soviet Defense Ministry newspaper Red Star described 
him as a "Soviet intelligence agent" and an officer of the KGB, the Soviet 
intelligence and security service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Russian Name in Obituary 
</P>
<P>
But the obituary, signed by the leadership of the Committee for State Security, 
as the KGB is formally known, identified him as "Mikhail Yevgenyevich Orlov 
(Glenn Michael Souther)" -- a formulation clearly suggesting that the Russian 
name was his real identity. 
</P>
<P>
This raised the possibility that Orlov-Souther, who joined the U.S. Navy in 
January, 1975, at the age of 18, had been infiltrated into the United States as 
a teen-age Soviet agent. 
</P>
<P>
"M. Y. Orlov had a short but full and brilliant life, which was totally devoted 
to the struggle for removing the threat of nuclear war looming over mankind and 
for a better life for ordinary people," the prominently placed obituary said. 
</P>
<P>
"Over a long period, he performed important special missions and made a major 
contribution to ensuring the state security of the Soviet Union. This struggle 
demanded great personal bravery, requiring all his physical and moral strength. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
"The clear memory of a brave intelligence agent, a man commited to his 
international duties, a gifted, opened-hearted and kind man, will remain 
forever in the thankful hearts of the Soviet people." 
</P>
<P>
The obituary in Red Star did not explain Orlov-Souther's death at such a young 
age. 
</P>
<P>
However, Britain's Guardian newspaper today quoted KGB chief Vladimir A. 
Kryuchkov in an interview from Moscow as saying that the man, driven by 
"massive nervous tension," killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tragic thing. He committed suicide," Kryuchkov was quoted as saying. 
"He was buried yesterday. He leaves a Russian wife and daughter." 
</P>
<P>
Kryuchkov added: "He had felt bad for some time. He was under massive nervous 
tension because he worked for a long time in very difficult conditions." 
</P>
<P>
But the cause of death was perhaps the least of the issues raised by the 
obituary's publication. 
</P>
<P>
The key question remains -- as it was when Souther disappeared in May, 1986, 
after graduating from Old Dominion University in Virginia: Was he a Soviet spy 
and, if so, for how long? 
</P>
<P>
If he was a Soviet agent, as FBI counterintelligence agents apparently 
suspected, was he an American? When he enlisted in the Navy, Souther said he 
had been born on Jan. 30, 1957, in Hammond, Ind., and went to Greely High 
School in Cumberland, Me. Or was he a Soviet "sleeper" assigned at a very young 
age, perhaps only 16 or 17, to infiltrate the U.S. intelligence services? 
</P>
<P>
And, whether he was a defector, a recruited American agent or one of the fabled 
Soviet "sleepers," why did the KGB decide to announce his death, particularly 
in such a prominent manner? 
</P>
<P>
"Secrecy is the byword for an intelligence service, and the KGB is as 
secrecy-conscious as any of them," a senior West European diplomat commented 
Tuesday. "The more successful an operation, the more you try to keep it secret. 
And so the question arises, 'Why are they telling us this?' 
</P>
<P>
"Is this a sort of 'Gotcha!' signal from one intelligence service to another?" 
the diplomat asked. "Is it a more serious sort of signal, perhaps one that 
implies that Orlov-Souther's death was . . . well, not quite natural? Maybe he 
was found to be a double agent and was eliminated. Or is it a political signal 
that says, more metaphorically, 'We in the KGB are not going to play such games 
any longer'? Or maybe they have just given Souther a Russian name to drive the 
Americans crazy wondering about a guy who may, after all, just have been a 
plain old defector. 
</P>
<P>
"Whoever Glenn Michael Souther or Mikhail Yevgenyevich Orlov was or were -- or 
maybe still is, or are, for how do we know anyone has died? -- he may well mean 
much more in death than he did in life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Answers in Obituary 
</P>
<P>
The obituary in Red Star provided no answers to any of these questions, but a 
photograph of Orlov-Souther, taken when he was probably in his early 20s, 
accompanied the obituary, strengthening the suggestion that he had long been a 
Soviet agent. 
</P>
<P>
When he surfaced in Moscow last July, FBI spokesmen in Washington said that 
Souther had served in the U.S. Navy for nearly eight years, from 1975 to late 
1982, and left as a petty officer first class after serving aboard the aircraft 
carrier Nimitz in the Mediterranean, then on the 6th Fleet's headquarters staff 
and finally at the headquarters of the Naval Air Training Command. 
</P>
<P>
Interviewed on Soviet television last July after he was formally granted 
"political asylum," Souther said that he had worked most of that time as an 
intelligence analyst, assessing photographs of possible targets taken from 
space by reconnaissance satellites. He had also worked, he said, as an aide to 
the 6th Fleet commander. He had special security clearances for all these jobs, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving the Navy, he studied Russian language and literature and Soviet 
affairs at Old Dominion University and, as an active naval reservist, worked 
part time as an analyst at the Naval Intelligence Center in Norfolk, Va., again 
evaluating photographs taken by reconnaissance satellites. He again had a 
special security clearance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The account that Souther gave a year ago, in two lengthy interviews on Soviet 
television and another in the government newspaper Izvestia, conflicts sharply 
with his portrayal as a longtime Soviet agent. 
</P>
<P>
As Souther, who spoke and acted and appeared to think as an American, explained 
his defection to the Soviet Union, the decision to seek political asylum here 
had developed from a growing disenchantment with U.S. foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
He told of his "persecution" at Old Dominion by students belonging to the Young 
Republicans organization on campus, of his interrogations by the FBI, of the 
hostility he faced simply for his love of Russian poetry. 
</P>
<P>
His former wife, with whom he had a son, reportedly alerted U.S. 
counterintelligence to his activities while he was in the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
"Glenn Souther understood that he was to be treated as an enemy of the nation 
and even a Russian spy," an Izvestia correspondent wrote in a long and 
flattering profile of him. "His destiny now was to be under the surveillance of 
the CIA and the FBI for his whole life. 
</P>
<P>
In his interviews with the Soviet press, Orlov-Souther seemed to be yet another 
American who had come to believe in the promises of socialism to the point 
where his political allegiances had shifted. Three or four times a year, the 
Soviet government announces such a "defection," although most of those granted 
"asylum" return to the United States within two years. 
</P>
<P>
He complained to his interviewers of some initial problems settling in and 
finding a proper job but expressed strong optimism about the "new life" he had 
found in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy officials interviewed Souther last August, and a spokesman for the 
Soviet Foreign Ministry said that he had reaffirmed that his decision to seek 
political asylum here was "voluntary and considered."

On a 22-6 vote, the Senate sent the bill by Sen. Joseph Montoya (D-Whittier) to 
the Assembly. One opponent, Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia), maintained that the 
proposal would encourage "bashing" of investors from Japan and other nations. 
</P>
<P>
But Montoya insisted: "We are not bashing anyone." 
</P>
<P>
In separate actions, the upper chamber also overwhelmingly approved legislation 
to toughen penalties against students who attack teachers but rejected a bill 
to require fast-food operations to label the type of oil used in cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya's bill, one of the Legislature's few attempts to deal with widespread 
concern that California is being bought up by wealthy foreign investors, 
generated relatively little debate. 
</P>
<P>
Under the measure, starting April 1, foreign individuals and corporate 
investors in California real estate or commercial property would have to file 
annual reports with the secretary of state. Failure to do so would be 
punishable by a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
The reports would provide such information as interest in real estate or in 
tangible property, if value exceeds $2 million or an investment represents more 
than 5% of the total ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the investor would have to report his or her citizenship, 
business ownerships, purchase prices of ownership interests, acreage and square 
footage acquired and nature or percentage of ownership interests. 
</P>
<P>
Excluded from filing would be foreigners with an interest of less than $350,000 
in a business operation in California or those whose only investment is in a 
single-family dwelling that the buyer occupied continuously. 
</P>
<P>
The information would be supplied to the secretary of state, who, in turn, 
would produce a report for the governor and Legislature listing aggregate data 
but not identifying investors by name, address or dollar amounts. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya said such information is needed because data "we get from the federal 
Department of Commerce is 3 years old. (And) if other countries monitor 
American investments, we ought to do the same thing so we can better plan what 
we are going to do in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Background material supplied to the Senate showed that investors from Canada 
were the largest foreign owners of plants and equipment in California at $5.6 
billion, followed by Japan at $4.6 billion and the United Kingdom at $4.3 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese were the largest foreign employers in California at 60,900 
workers, followed by West Germany at 52,550 and the United Kingdom at 51,400. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate action, the Senate approved and sent to the Assembly on a 28-1 
vote a bill to crack down on youths who attack teachers. The bill calls for 
trying as adults 16- and 17-year-olds accused of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, by Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), was prompted by a recent series of 
violent acts against teachers, including the fatal March 24 shooting outside 
his home of Hal Arthur, 60, a popular Grant High School teacher in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The bill calls for adding three years to the sentences of youths convicted of 
crimes against teachers or other school employees on school-related business 
either on or off campus. Such crimes would include murder, voluntary 
manslaughter, rape and kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen- and 17-year-olds accused of first-degree murder of school employees 
would be tried as adults, unless a judge found circumstances that justified 
trying them in juvenile court. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), an opponent of the death penalty, voiced 
concern that the bill could "play right into the hands" of those who favor 
executing murderers under age 18. She said her fear is fueled by U.S. Supreme 
Court rulings on Monday that 16- and 17-year-old murderers and slayers 
afflicted by mental retardation can be put to death under certain 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins and others countered, however, that the bill would not change 
California's prohibition against executing murderers under age 18. To change 
the law would require separate legislation, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Defeat of the bill requiring fast-food chains to label food containers to 
identify the type of oils used in cooking represented a victory for the 
fast-food industry. The bill was designed to help consumers avoid saturated 
fats that can raise cholesterol levels, including animal fat, coconut oil and 
palm oil. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, by Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia), failed on an 18-15 vote, three 
votes short of the 21 required. Members of the Senate came under heavy pressure 
from the restaurant and grocery industries to vote against the bill, arguing 
that such labeling could spread to the rest of the food industry.

GUARANTEED INSURANCE BILL PASSES ASSEMBLY

<P>
Voting along party lines, Assembly Democrats on Tuesday overcame a bloc of 
Republican opposition and approved legislation that would guarantee health 
insurance for 5 million Californians who are now without it. 
</P>
<P>
The $5-billion plan, deemed a "socialist" scheme by one GOP critic, would be 
financed by two new taxes on employers and by portions of the state's Medi-Cal 
funds, tobacco tax revenue, money now spent on health care for the working poor 
and premiums assessed on the new program's beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, by Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles), is one of three that 
the Assembly has approved in the past week which together would provide health 
insurance for every Californian. 
</P>
<P>
One of the other bills, by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), 
would require companies with more than five half-time employees to provide 
health insurance for their workers. The third, by Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg 
(D-Sacramento), would establish a state program to provide insurance for people 
whose medical histories make it difficult or impossible for them to obtain 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear how the three bills will fare in the Senate, which approved its 
own catastrophic health insurance bill Tuesday, or if the measures would be 
signed by Republican Gov. George Deukmejian. But the bills demonstrate that the 
state's crisis-ridden health-care system has moved near the top of the Assembly 
Democrats' list of legislative priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"All three bills raise the question of the enormous problem the state is now 
facing with the uninsured," Fresno Democrat Bruce Bronzan, chairman of the 
Assembly Health Committee, said in an interview. "Twenty percent of the 
population has no insurance whatsoever. The majority of these are working 
people. The system is in a crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Bronzan and other Democrats maintain that the problems created by the uninsured 
also affect Californians who are not poor. The state's emergency rooms are 
overburdened with patients who cannot afford to pay for care, they say, and the 
cost of such treatment is threatening to sink trauma centers that save the 
lives of the middle class and wealthy as well as the poor. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, even if it does not become law, is intended to focus public 
attention on the issue and force Republican lawmakers and Deukmejian to offer 
alternative proposals of their own, Bronzan said. 
</P>
<P>
"None of these proposals are perfect," Bronzan said. "They all have their 
problems, and they all have their flash points of controversy. But this is an 
area the Legislature has ignored for too long. What we're seeing now is an 
attempt to move all these issues along to . . . promote the discussion and 
exploration of how to deal with this problem." 
</P>
<P>
Margolin's bill, approved on a vote of 42 to 32, may have the least chance of 
being signed by the governor. Unlike the bills by Brown and Isenberg, 
Margolin's measure proposes two tax increases for employers. Deukmejian, since 
taking office in 1983, has refused to approve new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Margolin said his measure is designed to complement Brown's bill requiring most 
employers to provide insurance coverage for their workers. Margolin's measure 
would assess a payroll tax on employers, but it would exempt any company that 
offers employees private insurance coverage, which could be purchased through 
the state at reduced rates. 
</P>
<P>
The unemployed would also be covered under the plan, and their coverage would 
be financed by a new unemployment tax on businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would also subject health insurance rates to regulation by the 
state insurance commissioner and limit rate increases to increases in the 
consumer price index. 
</P>
<P>
Margolin contends that savings produced by insuring every Californian would be 
sufficient to prevent rate increases for other customers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Hidden Tax' 
</P>
<P>
"There is a tremendous hidden tax on all employers today, because the costs of 
health care for the uninsured are shifted to those who do purchase insurance," 
Margolin said. "This bill spreads the burden equitably." 
</P>
<P>
No Republicans voted for the bill. All 32 votes against the measure were cast 
by GOP members. 
</P>
<P>
"All you're trying to do is find new socialist ways of sticking it to the 
taxpayers and the golden goose of businesses out there," Assemblyman Gil 
Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) said of the bill. "How could you in good conscience 
subject businesses to these additional costs?" 
</P>
<P>
Margolin called Ferguson's criticism "absurd" and said business interests are 
beginning to support efforts to mandate employer-provided insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate, meanwhile, passed legislation by Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) to 
create a statewide, privately administered, nonprofit health insurance pool 
that would save consumers money by charging reduced commissions. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins called Medi-Cal the insurance program of "last resort" for many 
Californians who cannot afford health insurance. He noted that they must "spend 
their money down to the point where they qualify for Medi-Cal. That's a 
terrible way to qualify for health insurance." 
</P>
<P>
The Senate approved the bill on a vote of 33 to 0 and sent it to the Assembly.

FDA PROBES UNDERGROUND TESTING OF AIDS DRUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday it has launched an 
investigation into an underground AIDS drug trial after reports that one 
patient in the study had died and others had suffered serious adverse 
reactions. 
</P>
<P>
The trial, an audacious challenge to the federal regulatory system, was 
designed to quickly test the safety and efficacy of a highly touted Chinese 
drug known as Compound Q. 
</P>
<P>
The experiment was undertaken without FDA sanction or approval by Martin 
Delaney, co-director of Project Inform, an advocacy and treatment information 
group, and is being conducted by doctors in San Francisco, New York and Los 
Angeles using drugs imported into the United States from China. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Scale and Nature' 
</P>
<P>
In announcing the probe, the FDA said it will look into the "scale and nature" 
of the Project Inform operation, the experiment's safety procedures and "the 
exact circumstances surrounding the death and other adverse reactions." 
</P>
<P>
"Questions also remain about the exact composition of the product and whether 
it was illegally imported into the country," the agency added. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd Stephens, San Francisco's chief medical examiner, said Tuesday that he had 
declined to perform an autopsy on 45-year-old Robert Parr, the patient in the 
unauthorized clinical trial who died Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"We concluded that the death was likely the result of the patient's underlying 
condition, AIDS" he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those conducting the experiment insist that they have been operating within the 
law because FDA regulations allow, under certain conditions, treatments with 
unproven drugs obtained from overseas. 
</P>
<P>
But, former FDA Commissioner Dr. Jere E. Goyan, currently dean of UC San 
Francisco's School of Pharmacy and himself an advocate of regulatory reform, 
said, "It seems like a straight-forward challenge of the regulatory system to 
me. 
</P>
<P>
"They are depending on a very frail argument -- that individual patients can 
bring in drugs for individual use," Goyan added. "My guess is that the agency's 
lawyers could easily destroy the argument, if they wanted to." 
</P>
<P>
Compound Q is a Chinese drug made from the root tubers of a cucumber plant and 
has been used in China to induce abortions and for cancer treatments since the 
Third Century. Some researchers say the drug selectively kills certain cells 
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, several medical ethicists said they understood the frustration that 
might drive physicians to want to circumvent the FDA. But they said the 
experiment could backfire, hurting not only patients but the future of Compound 
Q and other experimental drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a logical outgrowth of what we have seen during the epidemic," said 
Dr. Marcus Conant of San Francisco, a prominent AIDS doctor who declined an 
invitation to participate in the trial. "These patients are young and 
well-educated and are not going to sit around while institutions like the FDA 
fail to save them." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert J. Levine, a professor of medicine at Yale University who 
specializes in the ethics of clinical trials, said the unsanctioned trial could 
actually end up slowing down the process of making Compound Q widely available 
to patients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Have Power 
</P>
<P>
"The FDA could say, 'We are not going to review these data because you violated 
our regulations,' " Levine said. "They also have the power to approve it. But I 
think people at the FDA would have some anxieties about setting such a 
precedent." 
</P>
<P>
George Annas, a professor of health law at Boston University School of 
Medicine, called the trial "more a political action than a scientific action." 
Annas and others said the study circumvents not only the FDA but also 
long-established rules for protecting human subjects. 
</P>
<P>
For example, federal and state rules governing university-based and federally 
funded trials require evidence that a drug's potential benefits outweigh its 
potential risks. Annas noted that the rebel researchers have not done 
preliminary safety studies that would answer that question. 
</P>
<P>
"You're dealing with a drug that's potentially dangerous," Annas said. "Until 
you get more information on the toxicity level, I think it's premature to go 
ahead and give it in therapeutic doses to human beings." 
</P>
<P>
Accepted research rules also require proof that patients in trials have given 
their "informed consent." Annas said it would be impossible to get informed 
consent in the absence of information about risks and benefits that would be 
gleaned from preliminary work. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that starting a trial without a clear understanding of a drug's 
toxicity is both professionally and morally irresponsible," added Ronald Bayer, 
an ethicist and associate professor at Columbia University's School of Public 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trial Defended 
</P>
<P>
But supporters of the unauthorized drug testing program, noting that AIDS is 
now claiming about 100 Americans a day, staunchly and emotionally defended the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
"How dare the government and the ethicists stand in our way with yesterday's 
morality?" demanded New York playwright and AIDS activist Larry Kramer, who 
cited anecdotal reports of great improvements in experimental subjects. 
</P>
<P>
"The world must know that we are capable of running our own studies, and that 
the system is murderously slow, and that we cannot wait," Kramer added. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand the desperate need," said Albert Jonsen, a professor of ethics in 
medicine at the University of Washington. "But it's precisely the desperate 
need that gets us into trouble. . . . To get a drug out that is primarily 
understood on the basis of rumor rather than the rigorous evaluation the system 
calls for is, I think, a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Larry Waites, a San Francisco physician participating in the trial, argued 
Tuesday that there was a "moral obligation" to set up the trial. With Compound 
Q available on the black market, AIDS patients would be risking their lives to 
take it unsupervised, Waites said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were faced with a very explosive situation," Waites said Tuesday. "We knew 
that hundreds of thousands of doses of this drug were going to be imported 
soon. We knew that people could do themselves great harm taking the drug 
without supervision." 
</P>
<P>
As for the patient who died, Waites said Parr went into a coma in reaction to 
the drug. Waites said the patient was "recovering nicely" but then vomited in 
his sleep and suffocated. 
</P>
<P>
Waites called the patient's death "a complication, certainly, of his recovering 
from his coma." But he said the researchers do not consider the death a side 
effect of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Among those monitoring the experiment was a representative of the American 
Foundation for AIDS Research's directory of experimental treatments. 
</P>
<P>
"When it became clear that a (Compound Q) treatment program was in motion, we 
moved rapidly to get a reporter on the scene to capture as much hard data as 
possible," said Mitchell Speer, editor of the directory. 
</P>
<P>
"As we see it, there just isn't enough data currently available to draw any 
solid conclusions about the usefulness of this agent," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Waites said the Compound Q trial is being conducted largely by practicing 
physicians under the leadership of two San Francisco immunologists, Dr. Alan S. 
Levin and Dr. Vera Byers. Waites said Byers has worked extensively with another 
drug related to Compound Q. 
</P>
<P>
On the basis of Byers' experience, and reports from China, Waites said the 
group was able to predict and treat the side effects of Compound Q injections 
-- mostly "aches and pains" in the 72 hours after the weekly intravenous 
injection.

ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS BALK AT COMPROMISE ON TIMBER HARVEST 
</P>

Environmentalists risked the wrath of Congress by declining Tuesday to accept a 
compromise in the battle over the nation's dwindling old-growth forests, but 
efforts to salvage the deal were launched immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Talks resumed Tuesday afternoon after a key House budget subcommittee vote was 
postponed until Thursday, giving negotiators more time to seek mutually 
acceptable timber-harvest limits for the fiscal year beginning in October. 
</P>
<P>
Without a breakthrough, the current standoff may lead to more mill closures and 
thousands more layoffs. It may also spur Oregon's congressional delegation -- a 
leader in timber matters -- to try to weaken environmental-protection and 
logging-practices laws. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tidal Wave of Job Losses' 
</P>
<P>
"We made it clear on Saturday that we were not willing to accept a tidal wave 
of job loss and the disruption of lives," said Republican Sen. Mark O. 
Hatfield, leader of the delegation and of the effort to find a bipartisan 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was offered by Oregon's seven-member delegation and Democratic 
Gov. Neil Goldschmidt after a historic eight-hour summit Saturday between 
environmentalists and timber industry leaders in Salem, the state capital. 
</P>
<P>
Basically, the deal would set harvest levels for a cooling-off period -- 4.8 
billion board-feet this fiscal year and 5.2 billion in 1990. A board-foot is a 
measurement a foot square and an inch thick; about 150,000 three-bedroom homes 
could be built with 1 billion board-feet of timber. 
</P>
<P>
The levels are lower than what the industry has demanded, but more than that 
allowed under two federal court orders won by environmentalists. Congressional 
staffers said that level, or "cut," would be enough to preserve an estimated 
6,000 jobs in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists are being asked to give up their successful court fight and 
not sue again during the length of the compromise agreement, which would extend 
to Oct. 1, 1990. In return, they would for the first time have congressionally 
recognized protection of Oregon's old-growth, or virgin, Douglas fir forests. 
</P>
<P>
Old-growth has been the subject of a long and bitter debate in the dense 
forests of the Pacific Northwest. The industry position is that old-growth is 
unproductive and should be replaced by vigorous, new, managed tree farms. 
Environmentalists say the "ancient" forests are invaluable sources of wildlife, 
beauty, recreation and biological diversity -- and the only viable habitat for 
such rare species as the northern spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Injunctions Obtained 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have obtained injunctions in two lawsuits that have tied up 
about one-third of the scheduled federal timber sales in Oregon and similar 
amounts in California and Washington. This has been blamed for an unusual rash 
of layoffs, but some people contend that log exports and automation are to 
blame. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy is so intense because environmentalists say that as little as 
10% of the original old-growth remains. Industry says the forests must be cut 
or the region's huge timber industry could collapse. 
</P>
<P>
Three points are holding up the compromise, an environmental coalition said in 
a letter Tuesday to the Oregon delegation and Goldschmidt. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists said they believe that the timber supply sought in the 
proposal is available without cutting old-growth, but by selling other, less 
mature trees and by closing legal loopholes that allow the export of raw, uncut 
logs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Specific Numbers Reported 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists also requested specific numbers supporting the proposal's 
protection for "significant" stands of old-growth. They suggested protecting 
stands of as small as 80 acres; congressional staff members said the limit can 
be no smaller than 400 acres to make the agreement work. 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, the environmentalists balked at the request that they forsake their 
right to sue if the settlement is not enforced to their expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Conciliatory wording in the letter and private conversations have led some 
congressional intermediaries to remain hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
Said one: "As we see it, there are no red lights here."

The Chinese soldiers were beating and kicking the young man outside his 
apartment complex on Beijing's No. 3 Ring Road late Tuesday afternoon, as the 
crowd of gaping commuters along the busy thoroughfare quickly began to swell. 
</P>
<P>
"But I live here," the young victim shouted to his attackers and anyone else in 
the crowd who would listen, as he frantically waved his arms to ward off the 
blows. "I live here." 
</P>
<P>
The handful of helmeted soldiers, dressed in full battle fatigues and gripping 
AK-47 rifles, harassed him relentlessly until the crowd finally began pulling 
him away, over a fence and onto the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
"But I live here," he repeated to a sympathetic woman tugging him into the 
protective embrace of the crowd. "They won't let me go home." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Advice in Hushed Tones 
</P>
<P>
The woman tried to shake sense into him, encouraging him in hushed tones to 
stay away -- far away -- until the soldiers, who had blocked off the apartment 
complex, finished their work. There was nothing else to be done, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Equally helpless was a well-dressed middle-aged man. As he watched the soldiers 
rain blows and kicks on their hapless victim, he turned to a foreigner in the 
crowd and, under his breath, said: "I really detest these guys. I hate them so 
much." 
</P>
<P>
More than three weeks after troops used tanks and bullets against students and 
citizens in Beijing to put down demonstrations against corruption and for 
democracy, no one in the crowd of several hundred on No. 3 Ring Road dared to 
intervene in the military operation at the apartment complex Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But the incident, although a tiny detail in a sprawling capital that once again 
surges each day with the normal bustle of urban life and commerce, gave a 
glimpse of the lingering feelings about the People's Liberation Army that 
apparently continue to seethe just beneath the city's surface. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the general public mood now that China's leadership has 
instituted a nationwide crackdown on the dissidents, one Western diplomat in 
Beijing said Tuesday, "Obviously, there's a lot of bitterness, a lot of anger, 
in the urban population." 
</P>
<P>
Such sentiments appear to be well known to the army's leadership, which 
apparently endorsed the lethal crackdown ordered by hard-liners in China's 
Communist Party leadership on the night of June 3-4, when hundreds, perhaps 
thousands, were killed. 
</P>
<P>
A column in Monday's Liberation Army Daily, official organ of the Chinese armed 
forces, was surprisingly candid and critical in its self-reflection. 
</P>
<P>
Under a label, "Martial Law Troops -- the Words of Officers and Soldiers," it 
quoted soldiers as criticizing colleagues for driving their troop trucks -- 
"vehicles of power and prestige," the column called them -- recklessly and 
dangerously through the streets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Lesson Without Reason' 
</P>
<P>
"Some comrades, while on duty, have not been too polite towards the masses," 
the column quoted an officer as saying. "They have taught people a lesson 
without reason." 
</P>
<P>
And the column's headline reflected the tightrope the army is trying to balance 
on -- keeping order on the streets and in its ranks while trying to win back 
popular support. "In the midst of the praise, we ought to be cautious and 
modest," the headline warned. 
</P>
<P>
But on the streets of Beijing this Tuesday, that advice had made no converts. 
The apartment complex where Tuesday's incident occurred was, in the words of 
one soldier rudely shoving the crowd out of the way, "a martial law area." So 
the operation in progress was none of their business, he shouted at the 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Later, a gentler officer explained that several hundred soldiers at the complex 
were searching for a sniper who had fired onto the street from a 12th-floor 
apartment. No civilian eyewitnesses could be found to corroborate the shooting, 
but few in the crowd felt free to speak. 
</P>
<P>
"We will certainly find him," the officer asserted, as his soldiers searched 
each apartment in each of the four 14-story buildings, whose residents are 
among the wealthier and more privileged families in the capital. Asked when, 
the officer replied, "Tonight. We will definitely find him tonight." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the soldiers did not find their sniper; they gave up their search 
after midnight. By then, the incident had lasted eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the apartments, the people in the crowd just watched in silent anger -- 
some of them, like the young man who was beaten, residents who could not go 
home; others, like most in the crowd, simply cowed into numb obedience.

Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke endorsed U.S. policy toward China during 
talks Tuesday with President Bush and said it would be counterproductive to 
impose economic sanctions on the world's most populous nation. 
</P>
<P>
"Our views are identical" on China, Hawke told reporters while posing for 
pictures with Bush in the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
"We completely, unequivocally abhor and condemn the barbarism, the murder, the 
execution, the suppression of legitimate human aspirations," Hawke said. 
</P>
<P>
Hawke, nearing the end of his four-day visit to Washington, praised Bush for 
publicly deploring the Chinese government's decision to crush pro-democracy 
demonstrations with force, while refraining from taking major economic moves to 
punish Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Would Be Counterproductive' 
</P>
<P>
"We also agree that for the same reason that we want to ensure that those 
interests in China have the opportunity of being advanced, that it would be 
counterproductive to end the economic relationship," the prime minister said. 
</P>
<P>
Bush has faced mounting pressures from members of Congress who want the United 
States to take a harsher position on China.

WEST EUROPE FOLLOWS U.S. LEAD, SUSPENDS NORMAL CHINA TIES

Following in the wake of the Bush Administration, the 12 European Community 
nations Tuesday froze normal relations with China but stopped short of imposing 
trade sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
The list of six measures, including the suspension of high-level diplomatic 
contacts, the postponement of new cooperative projects and a reduction of 
cultural, scientific and technical cooperation, followed similar actions 
already taken by several of the community's individual states. 
</P>
<P>
The action followed an initial declaration issued June 6 in which the community 
strongly condemned "the brutal repression taking place in China." 
</P>
<P>
Community officials said Tuesday's statement was designed to signal the Chinese 
leadership that normal relations are impossible so long as the repression 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
"(The community) solemnly requests the Chinese authorities to stop the 
executions and to put an end to the repressive actions against those who 
legitimately claim their democratic rights," the declaration stated. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has announced a total of 27 executions related to the 
protests and the political crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
The community's leaders also agreed to raise the issue of human rights in China 
in international meetings and offer visa extensions to Chinese students 
currently studying in Europe who apply for them. 
</P>
<P>
While they moved to suspend military cooperation and impose an arms embargo on 
China, they took no action to interrupt other trade. 
</P>
<P>
Collectively, the 12 member countries constitute China's second largest trading 
partner, after Japan. Last year, trade between the community and China totaled 
just under $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The European Community first established relations with China in 1975 and has 
held regular ministerial-level meetings with that nation for the past six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
It opened a permanent mission in Beijing last October and was negotiating a new 
commercial-economic agreement when the violence erupted. 
</P>
<P>
"Those negotiations are now on hold," a community official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East, the 12 leaders also reaffirmed their commitment to a 
U.N.-sponsored international peace conference for resolving the Arab-Israeli 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
They said such a conference should include representatives from the Palestine 
Liberation Organization.

PRESIDENT TO UNVEIL ELECTION REFORM PROPOSALS, SEEK FEDERAL PAY HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to rising public distress about ethics in government, President Bush 
plans to unveil a package of campaign reform proposals Thursday coupled with a 
new push for a federal pay raise, he said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a press conference Tuesday morning, the President also offered his first 
comments on Washington's latest ethics investigation, the widening scandal over 
influence peddling at the Department of Housing and Urban Development during 
the Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"We are going to do everything we can to clean up any cronyism or see that 
matters of that nature not recur," Bush said, but he refused to assign blame to 
former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. or to close Bush associates who have 
been implicated in the affair, saying that he does not want to "jump at 
conclusions as to what guilt is and what it isn't." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decided Against Legislation 
</P>
<P>
In a wide-ranging discussion of domestic policy issues, the President also said 
that he has decided against any legislative move to restore affirmative action 
protections that were cut back by the Supreme Court in recent decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"Legislation isn't necessary," Bush said, citing an analysis of the cases given 
to him by Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh. Although civil rights groups have 
attacked the court's decisions as major blows to affirmative action plans, Bush 
said that he views the court's actions as simply interpretations of "technical" 
provisions of the law. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also reiterated his opposition to Democratic-backed child care 
legislation. But he stopped short of directly threatening to veto the 
Democratic plan, known as the Act for Better Child Care, which has passed the 
Senate and is likely to come up later this year in the House. Bush is backing a 
rival proposal that would provide tax credits to low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
In discussing his campaign reform proposals, Bush said that he also plans to 
call for an increase in pay for judges and executive branch employees with 
specialized training, such as researchers at the National Institutes of Health, 
but not an increase for Congress, the subject of intense public opposition 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be some specific recommendations with amounts," on a pay raise, he 
said. The statement surprised top aides, who had expected Bush only to offer a 
general endorsement of a pay increase, rather than a specific plan. Bush 
repeatedly has said that he would like to see Congress pass a pay increase for 
judges and some executive branch officials and that while he favors some kind 
of an increase for Congress, he would prefer to see that politically difficult 
issue handled separately. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Restrictions on PACs 
</P>
<P>
On campaign reform, meanwhile, Bush's plan is expected to center around new 
restrictions on donations by political action committees. Under the plan, 
corporations and labor unions no longer would be allowed to use money from 
their general treasuries to pay the costs of running a PAC. All the costs of a 
PAC would have to be taken from members' contributions. 
</P>
<P>
Under that plan, most corporate and union PACs would be likely to dissolve, 
while free-standing ideological PACs, which have no source of funds other than 
member contributions, would be likely to continue operating. 
</P>
<P>
Because the vast bulk of PAC contributions go to incumbents, most of whom are 
Democrats, Democratic leaders were quick to say that Bush's plan is as much a 
political attack as an effort at reform. The plan is likely to include several 
other provisions aimed at key sources of Democratic money, including a proposal 
to require labor unions to disclose how much they spend on telephone banks and 
other get-out-the-vote efforts that generally benefit Democratic candidates. 
The disclosures could give GOP candidates ammunition to use against 
labor-backed Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be outraged by a suggestion of that nature," Bush said with a broad 
smile when asked about partisan considerations in drafting his plan. Leading 
Republicans, however, conceded that partisan advantage had played a major role. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an insider issue," said Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has led GOP 
campaign reform efforts in the Senate. "Each side knows how the bread is 
buttered and both would love to have the power to write the rules to get the 
other side. But we have the power to make sure they don't do it to us, and they 
have the power to make sure we don't do it to them." 
</P>
<P>
But, McConnell said, while there are several issues on which Democrats and 
Republicans are irreconcilably opposed, there are several on which agreement is 
possible. Bush's proposal, he said, could be the opening step in an effort to 
reach such a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
A senior aide to a key Senate Democrat made a similar point. White House 
involvement in campaign reform is "a positive sign" that should speed 
negotiations, he said. "At least the dialogue has been reopened." 
</P>
<P>
The chief issue on which Bush and his GOP allies have vowed not to budge is a 
Democratic proposal to limit the cost of campaigns and have congressional races 
paid for out of tax funds, rather than by private contributions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Incumbents Have Advantage 
</P>
<P>
Democrats, and some outside groups, such as Common Cause, argue that public 
financing and spending limits are the only solution to the repeated 
congressional ethics scandals, most of which have their roots in the 
ever-present need to raise campaign funds. But Republicans argue that spending 
limits serve mostly to give incumbents an edge over challengers, something that 
would preserve the Democratic advantage in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Many Republicans also have an ideological aversion to the idea of using tax 
funds to pay for campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
On the HUD scandal, Bush repeatedly deflected questions about who was to blame 
for the apparent mismanagement that allowed consultants with Republican 
political connections to win millions of dollars in federal contracts through 
programs designed to house low- and moderate-income Americans. 
</P>
<P>
"You're always looking for winners and losers and I am not about to prejudge," 
he said at one point. 
</P>
<P>
Several close Bush associates -- including his campaign finance chairman, 
Frederick Bush, who is not related to the President, and campaign adviser Paul 
Manafort, who formerly was a business partner of Republican National Committee 
Chairman Lee Atwater -- were among the consultants who profited from HUD 
contracts. But Bush said that he was unaware during his tenure as vice 
president that political influence was being used to obtain HUD contracts and 
he offered an oblique defense of former President Reagan as well. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Tremendous Bureaucracy' 
</P>
<P>
"Something might be happening in some department today that I know nothing 
about," he said. "We've got a tremendous bureaucracy that extends all around 
the world. And there might well be some corruption out there that's going on 
that I would be responsible for, but that I don't know about." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he would like to see higher standards apply now but that "I want to 
be sure that I don't jump at conclusions as to what guilt is and what it isn't, 
whether law was broken or were people just out there, you know, doing what was 
permitted."

MOST JUDGES FOLLOWING RULES ON STANDARDIZED PRISON TERMS 
</P>

Despite initial opposition, a majority of federal judges have complied with 
strict federal sentencing rules designed to set standard prison terms for 
criminals convicted of similar crimes, according to a study released Tuesday by 
the U.S. Sentencing Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The study revealed that of the criminals convicted between November, 1987, and 
March, 1989, 82.3% were sentenced within the guidelines set by the commission. 
Many judges had opposed the rules until the Supreme Court upheld them last 
January. Because of that, commission Chairman William W. Wilkins Jr. said, the 
high compliance rate "exceeded our expectation." 
</P>
<P>
The study found that 2.9% of the sentences were harsher than called for in the 
rules and that 9.1% were more lenient than the rules allowed. Wilkins said that 
judges can depart from the rules if the case involves factors not taken into 
account by the rules, such as age of the defendant or illness. "I'm sure there 
must be some (abuses), but these figures are so favorable I don't think there 
are very many," he said, adding that appeals to appellate courts will remedy 
most of the abuses. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkins, an appellate judge from South Carolina, attributed 5.7% of the more 
lenient sentences to rewards to the defendant for "substantial assistance" to 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
Some federal judges oppose the rules because "they interfere with their role as 
a judge and take away their discretion," said Tony Califa, legislative counsel 
for the American Civil Liberties Union. "They are very simplified and have 
caused many problems." 
</P>
<P>
Critics predicted that implementation of the rules would swamp the judicial 
system with trials, with defendants choosing to take their chances with a jury 
rather than pleading guilty and facing harsher penalties. 
</P>
<P>
But the study found no substantial increase in the number of trials in relation 
to pleas. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, created by Congress in 1984 to end disparities in sentencing, 
drew up rules to base sentences on crimes committed, virtually taking the 
sentencing decision out of the hands of individual judges.

VATICAN REJECTS DETROIT CHURCHES' APPEAL OF ORDER TO CLOSE BY JULY 1

The Vatican has turned down an appeal by 14 Roman Catholic churches of an 
archdiocesan order to close by July 1, and five parishes that had planned to 
defy Cardinal Edmund Szoka were reconsidering their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican's Sacred Congregation for the Clergy rejected the 14 appeals filed 
in March as lacking foundation in law and fact, archdiocese spokesman Jay 
Berman said Monday. The archdiocese has announced plans to close 30 churches 
due to declining membership. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a real discouragement among the people here that Rome didn't care 
about the injustices that have happened," Sister Jolene Van Handel said. Van 
Handel is coordinator of the Detroit Catholic Pastoral Alliance, a coalition of 
priests and lay people opposed to Szoka's plan. 
</P>
<P>
Nine parishes had said they would remain open, but some opposition eroded after 
a series of private weekend meetings between priests and Szoka, who ordered the 
closings in January after two committees made up of church and civic leaders 
recommended the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Two parishes that had planned to defy the cardinal said they now expect to 
accept the order and close by Friday. The pastor of a third congregation urged 
his parishioners to drop their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Another pastor said he will try to persuade his members to close, and a fifth 
parish said it now was undecided. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne County Circuit Court Judge James Hathaway is scheduled to consider a 
request by 18 parishes for an injunction against the closings at a hearing 
today.

WALTER MARTIN; ORANGE COUNTY RADIO MINISTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walter Martin, a Baptist minister whose radio show "The Bible Answer Man," was 
heard across the country, died Monday at his San Juan Capistrano home at age 60 
of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Heard in Orange County on KKLA-FM and in more than 100 other markets 
nationwide, Martin was considered an authority on the Bible and said his 
mission was to confront "cults" and "unbiblical beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
Martin founded his Christian Research Institute in 1960. The Irvine-based group 
started "The Bible Answer Man" four years later in New Jersey and moved it to 
Southern California in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Martin also was the author of several books, the best-known of which, "The 
Kingdom of the Cults," sold nearly 500,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Darlene, and six children.

NUCLEAR TEST DETONATED IN NEVADA DESERT

<P>
A nuclear weapons test that had been delayed by fickle wind conditions rattled 
the Nevada desert Tuesday with an explosion more than 10 times the force of the 
Hiroshima atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
The underground blast registered magnitude 4.6 at the National Earthquake 
Information Center in Golden, Colo., according to spokesman John Minsch. 
</P>
<P>
Monitors atop high-rise hotels in Las Vegas, 100 miles from Ground Zero, 
registered the blast. But the readings were not as distinct as with some 
previous tests. 
</P>
<P>
The test, code-named Amarillo, was the second major U.S. nuclear weapons test 
in six days. Energy Department officials deemed the latest blast a success. 
</P>
<P>
The device was detonated 2,100 feet beneath the surface of Pahute Mesa on the 
sprawling desert test range at 8:30 a.m. and had an explosive force of up to 
150,000 tons of TNT. The blast that destroyed Hiroshima had an explosive force 
of 13,000 tons of TNT. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's test was originally scheduled for Saturday, then delayed several 
times throughout the day because of unfavorable wind conditions. The blast was 
rescheduled for Sunday, then delayed again for the same reason.

A. S. ROSE, 81; LEADING UCLA NEUROLOGIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Augustus S. Rose, founding chairman of the Department of Neurology at UCLA 
Medical Center when it started in 1951 and one of a handful of doctors chosen 
to serve as a Distinguished Physician by the Veterans Administration, died of 
cancer Sunday at his home in Brentwood. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
Rose had remained head of the UCLA department until his retirement in 1974. 
Sherman M. Mellinkoff, former UCLA Medical School dean, said, "Under Dr. Rose's 
leadership, the Department of Neurology achieved national and international 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
"Among the major gifts that came to the department under his guidance was the 
bequest establishing the Clarence Reed Neurological Research Center at UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
Rose, a past president of the American Neurological Assn. and one of the 
founders of the American Academy of Neurology, was born in Fayetteville, N.C. 
He attended Davidson College and the University of North Carolina at Chapel 
Hill before receiving his medical degree at Harvard in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Active on Committees 
</P>
<P>
He trained at hospitals in Massachusetts and became board certified in both 
neurology and psychiatry. Over the years he was active in the World Federation 
of Neurology, serving on several international committees. 
</P>
<P>
He taught and lectured at the University of North Carolina, Boston University 
and Harvard before joining the embryonic UCLA Medical School faculty. 
</P>
<P>
Later he also taught at Wadsworth Veterans Hospital and toured the country for 
the VA, evaluating neurology training programs. 
</P>
<P>
Rose was active in the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Myasthenia 
Gravis Foundation, the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. and the Epilepsy Foundation of 
America. Additionally, he was a consultant to several committees of the 
National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alzheimer's Research 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year he was honored by the John Douglas French Foundation for 
Alzheimer's Research, which established a fellowship in his name at the UCLA 
department of neurology "in recognition of his splendid service as (founder and 
first) chairman of the foundation's National Scientific Advisory Board and of 
his eminence as one of America's great neurologists." 
</P>
<P>
Survivors include his wife, Grace, two daughters, two sons, seven grandchildren 
and a sister. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held at 2:30 p.m. Sunday at Westwood Presbyterian 
Church, 10822 Wilshire Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
The family suggests donations to research in multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's 
disease through the department of neurology, UCLA School of Medicine.

PRINCE VASILI ROMANOV; NEPHEW OF RUSSIAN CZAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATT MORRISON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Prince Vasili Romanov, nephew of the last Russian czar, has died at age 81 of 
natural causes at his home in Woodside, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
He was one of the last of the Russian-born Romanov princes and a nephew of Czar 
Nicholas II, the last reigning monarch before the 1917 revolution toppled the 
300-year-old Romanov dynasty and led to the death or exile of the imperial 
family. 
</P>
<P>
Romanov, born in the 1,000-room Gatchina Palace, was 10 years old at the time 
of the Bolshevik Revolution. In 1919, he and many relatives -- including his 
grandmother, the Dowager Empress Marie -- were rescued from the Crimea by a 
British battleship. 
</P>
<P>
"My saddest memory is the last time they played the Russian Imperial Anthem for 
us before we left sight of Russian soil for the last time," he told a Times 
reporter several years ago. "There was my grandmother, standing alone. What 
must her feelings and thoughts have been?" 
</P>
<P>
From then on, Romanov's life took on a humbler touch. 
</P>
<P>
He took to sea as a cabin boy. At various times he was a shipyard worker, a 
stockbroker in San Francisco and a chauffeur in Denmark for a couple who "never 
knew who I was." He briefly ran a beauty parlor in Cincinnati and worked for 
the Sikorsky helicopter firm. He also sold wine for Almaden and was a chicken 
farmer in Sonoma. 
</P>
<P>
"In my colorful career, I think I enjoyed the chicken farm most," Romanov said 
in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
He met his wife, Princess Natasha of the Russian family of Galitzine, in New 
York where she was working in the theater. She died three months ago at age 82 
at the Woodside home where they had lived for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Vasili Romanov was the youngest of seven children of Grand Duchess Xenia, one 
of Nicholas II's sisters, and Grand Duke Alexander, founder of the imperial air 
force. His great-grandfather was Alexander II, the "czar liberator" who freed 
Russia's millions of serfs. His grandfather was Czar Alexander III and his 
grandmother the Danish-born Marie, sister to Queen Alexandra of England. 
Romanov's great-uncles sat on the thrones of England, Greece and Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
Romanov and his brothers were "princes of the blood," who jokingly called 
themselves "bloody princes," he told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Romanov's only sister, Princess Irina, married Prince Felix Yussupov, one of 
the assassins of Rasputin. Rasputin was a bizarre monk-satyr figure whose power 
over the czar's wife through his supposed faith-healing of the czar's 
hemophiliac son and heir helped bring the dynasty to ruin. 
</P>
<P>
In California, Romanov was honorary curator of the Imperial Russian Collection 
at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. In his home, where one desk 
drawer was labeled "taxes," another was filled with his manuscripts and letters 
of the imperial family. 
</P>
<P>
Although he remained a vigorous critic of Bolshevism, the reforms of Mikhail 
Gorbachev left him "amazed and excited" and "very hopeful," his daughter said. 
</P>
<P>
Services are set for July 7, which would have been his 82nd birthday. His 
daughter, Marina Beadleston, and four grandchildren survive.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL PUTS OFF BROADCAST DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Will Los Angeles city government go Hollywood with its own television 
broadcast? What could this mean to the soaps? And which will get top billing, 
the Department of Building and Safety or the Bureau of Sanitation? 
</P>
<P>
All of these questions were put on hold Tuesday as the City Council voted to 
postpone until Aug. 8 a decision on a plan to broadcast municipal government 
programming on cable television stations. 
</P>
<P>
The council motion calls for construction of a nearly $4-million studio that 
would produce programming for city departments and then distribute it to cable 
municipal access channels, said Bill Speedie, legislative analyst to the 
council's Industry and Economic Development Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Programming would range from explanations of city programs to information on 
how people can obtain a building permit, said Speedie. 
</P>
<P>
The council decided to put off the matter so that it could be heard along with 
a related decision over how to use space in the Civic Center Mall, where the 
studio would be situated.

<TEXT>
<P>
You might have figured that the recent fire that destroyed the Pan Pacific 
Auditorium in the Fairfax district was easy to spot, inasmuch as the flames 
shot an estimated 200 feet into the air and the smoke from the blaze could be 
seen from as far away as the Civic Center and Silver Lake. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, says County Supervisor Mike Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
He's proposed a law to require all buildings three stories and taller to paint 
their addresses on their roofs because, he says, the Pan Pacific fire "pointed 
out the need to improve our ability to fully respond to major emergencies." 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich explained: "I'm advised that the Fire Department's aerial units had 
a great deal of difficulty in locating the key buildings because there were no 
addresses visible to the aerial units." 
</P>
<P>
How the numbers could have been seen through the smoke and flames was left 
unexplained. 
</P>
<P>
Stars and Gripes: 
</P>
<P>
At a time when numerous people are expressing outrage over the Supreme Court's 
recent decision protecting the burning of American flags, Thomas (Ski) Demski 
of Long Beach finds it ironic that he has to appear in court Thursday because 
he's too patriotic. 
</P>
<P>
He insists on flying a giant flag, which measures 47 feet by 82 feet, on a 
132-foot-tall pole in his front yard. City authorities, and some of his 
neighbors, say it flaps too loudly. 
</P>
<P>
Demski noted that a Las Cruces, N.M., man was recently found guilty of refusing 
to take down a noisy 3-by-5-foot flag. The Las Cruces patriot hasn't been 
sentenced yet. But Demski joked: "If he gets 30 days I guess I'll get 20 years. 
My flag's 250 times as big as his." 
</P>
<P>
Demski, an unsuccessful mayoral candidate who campaigned on a motorbike with a 
parrot on his shoulder, will hoist a second American flag to coincide with his 
appearance in Los Angeles County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
It's the one that says: "Don't Tread on Me." 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court flap moved Supervisor Kenneth Hahn to recall when, as a Los 
Angeles City Councilman after World War II, he helped push through an ordinance 
banning desecration of the American flag. 
</P>
<P>
Hahn took the action because, at the time, "there was a surplus of American 
flags, which used-car dealers bought and cut into pieces for streamers." 
</P>
<P>
A common complaint of executives is that, when it comes to practicing their 
putting stroke, the shag carpets in their offices are too bumpy. 
</P>
<P>
Now there's an alternative. The Pacific Concourse, a business park just south 
of Los Angeles International Airport, will feature an outside putting green 
made of real grass as well as a chipping area. The chip-shot practitioners 
naturally will be stationed farthest from office windows. 
</P>
<P>
A convention of 911 emergency operators gathered at the Queen Mary recently -- 
presumably they remembered to keep the phones back home manned in their absence 
-- and swapped stories. 
</P>
<P>
Convention speaker Arnold Shapiro, producer of the CBS television series, 
"Rescue 911," was told that one burglar broke into a store only to discover it 
was protected by ferocious guard dogs. What to do? He dialed 911 and asked the 
police to rescue him. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known if the store building had a number on top.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACCIDENT CLAIMS REJECTED BY AVALON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Avalon City Council has refused claims filed against the city stemming from 
a boating accident off the Santa Catalina Island coast that killed two Orange 
County men and injured three others in December. 
</P>
<P>
The claims allege that a harbor patrol officer observed the pilot of a 19-foot 
fishing boat drunk and cruising at high speeds, but failed to take preventive 
action before the boat crashed on rocks. 
</P>
<P>
One of the claims was filed by Newport Beach resident Mary Glose, whose 
husband, William Glose, 33, and son, Sean Caudillo, 22, were killed. Both men 
were passengers on the Impulse, which crashed on the rocks off Lovers Cove on 
the island's east coast. The claim sought an unspecified amount for wrongful 
death and various expenses. 
</P>
<P>
A separate claim seeking $275,000 was filed by David Wilken of Costa Mesa, a 
passenger on the boat. 
</P>
<P>
The men were among four passengers aboard the boat, which was piloted and owned 
by Alfred Gausewitz. The claim alleges that a harbor patrol officer should have 
issued a warning or stopped the boat before it left Avalon Harbor. Gausewitz 
and another passenger survived the crash.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY BACKS AWAY FROM SALE OF LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
L.A. County has backed away from a plan to dispose of 53 acres of undeveloped 
coastal land along the Rancho Palos Verdes-San Pedro border, disappointing 
individuals and organizations who had developed plans of their own for the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
The county bought the land in the early 1970s for a park that was never 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists had become concerned after the county Regional Planning 
Commission acted on a finding by the county Department of Parks and Recreation 
that the land is no longer needed. It said that sale of the land in Rancho 
Palos Verdes, on a bluff overlooking the ocean, would not conflict with the 
county general plan. 
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that the department began the process of declaring it 
surplus by asking for an appraisal, chief park planner Jim Park said last week 
that there has been no decision on what to do with the land. He called the 
commission action premature and said the county's options are to let the 
property remain open space, to develop a park or sell the land.

COURT RULING ON CIVIL RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The recent pronouncements of the Supreme Court against affirmative action must 
be judged within the context of the times. The United States is no longer an 
ascending world power, confident of its ability to solve all problems. To the 
contrary, having reached middle age, it seeks to define its goals and 
priorities in accordance to its declining strength in the world stage. 
</P>
<P>
As this country faces increasing challenges to its homogeneity from societies 
as dynamic and pugnacious as Japan, it finds itself forced to maximize its 
available resources within a more limited framework of utilization. Since white 
males have been the traditional beneficiaries of the nation's mechanisms of 
economic and political power distribution, it should come as no surprise that 
the attempt is now being made to protect their historical turf. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it is also important to recognize that, having always had access 
to the infrastructure of old boy networks as well as to relatively good 
schools, this group may well indeed be better "qualified" than the minorities 
and women who are now competing with them for the few good jobs available. 
</P>
<P>
What bothers me the most about present attitudes are not that affirmative 
action is being done away with (actually, there was never any affirmative 
action, but simply the attempt to give the appearance of such by putting a few 
blacks and Latinos in positions where they could exercise power over their own 
kind: policemen, social workers, teachers, etc.), but that there seems to exist 
a desire of large segments of the public to forget and even negate the effects 
of racism in its present and past modalities. 
</P>
<P>
How did it come to this? I suspect that the loss of the nation's sensitivity to 
racial issues coincides with the aging of the "baby boom" generation and the 
disillusionment of many of the radicals of the 1960s with the Third World and 
minorities in general. 
</P>
<P>
Disillusionment with Third World corruption was soon transferred to 
disenchantment with minorities in this country. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Reagan came into the national stage just at the right historical time to 
deal with these issues. He convinced much of the country that there is very 
little wrong with America, and that a great deal is wrong with those who are 
not Americans or who at least retain ties, no matter how tenuous, to lands less 
innocent and pure than America. 
</P>
<P>
Foreigners and minorities thus came to be seen no longer as the victims but 
rather as the victimizers of a pure and innocent America.

EX-PRESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conrad's cartoon of former President Reagan accepting a knighthood of sorts in 
lieu of a $50,000 speaking fee (June 19) was mournfully accurate. Our living 
ex-Presidents are a pretty sorry lot for the most part. Richard Nixon works 
very hard at proving he is not a thief; Gerald Ford improves his golf game; 
Ronald Reagan is for sale to any organization that will ante up the money. 
Jimmy Carter alone tries to give some honor to the office he once held, but so 
far the title of elder statesman has eluded him. 
</P>
<P>
Things weren't always like this. In Book Review I read Gary Nash's review of 
"Echo of Lions," about an incident 150 years ago wherein Africans slaves seized 
the ship they were being carried on from the Portuguese crew and then became 
embroiled in American political and legal battles (June 18). One of several 
heroes in this true story was former President John Quincy Adams, then in his 
70s, who chose to defend the Africans before the U.S. Supreme Court. There was 
a man who stood for something; I wish our current lot of ex-Presidents did.

DANGEROUS REMEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are two possible explanations for President Bush's decision to promote a 
constitutional amendment prohibiting vandalism of the American flag. Neither 
does the President much credit. 
</P>
<P>
One is that the advisers who so adroitly manipulated the flag and other popular 
patriotic symbols during his campaign last year persuaded him to take what 
political advantage he could of the Supreme Court's ruling that flag burning is 
a protected form of political protest. The other accepts his notion that the 
solemn compact by which this nation governs itself ought to change because Bush 
feels "viscerally" about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The First Amendment to the Constitution is the most majestic and flexible 
blueprint for the practical realization of fundamental human liberty ever 
devised. "Congress," it says, "shall make no law respecting an establishment of 
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of 
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and 
to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." 
</P>
<P>
In the 200 years since Congress approved those words as the first and most 
important provision of the charter we call our Bill of Rights, the United 
States has passed through armed civil turmoil, foreign wars, global 
confrontation with aggressive totalitarianism and economic and social changes 
so profound as to have been unimaginable to the framers. Yet in all that 
perilous passage, no one, no matter how dire the press of circumstance, has 
found it necessary to alter the language of the First Amendment or to create a 
constitutional exception to its application. 
</P>
<P>
Flag burning, with all its connotations of contempt for this country's basic 
institutions and the sacrifices made to maintain them, is a particularly 
noxious form of expressive speech. It is, in fact, political pornography. This 
court, like others before it, has wisely held that tolerance of obnoxious 
speech is the irritating -- but, in the end, not very burdensome -- price we 
pay for that freedom which is the root of all others. 
</P>
<P>
Cooler heads on both sides of the congressional aisle, like House Speaker 
Thomas S. Foley and conservative New Hampshire Sen. Gordon J. Humphrey, already 
have expressed skepticism about any attempt to alter the First Amendment. As 
outrage gives way to prudent deliberation, others doubtless will join them. The 
cynical, the opportunistic and the merely rash, however vocal, must not be 
allowed to have their way in this. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a tragic paradox indeed if an attempt to protect the symbol of the 
American nation became, in fact, an assault on the most substantial foundation 
of its liberties.

LIVING BY SALTON SEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Jones' column ("Salton Sea -- Victim of Salt and Apathy," May 23) on the 
Salton Sea correctly describes the deteriorating condition of the sea, but, I 
feel that his statements on recreational activities, visitors and local 
residents are misleading and distorted. 
</P>
<P>
Recent increases in boating and fishing activities have been dramatic, as I 
have observed personally on almost daily visits to Johnson's landing in Salton 
City (on the west shore), where fresh water is available for those wishing to 
clean their boats after outings on the sea. In addition to boaters we have many 
visitors from as far as Michigan, Illinois and the Pacific Northwest who winter 
in Salton City. For years large numbers of recreational vehicle enthusiasts 
have been flocking to our area. These visitors are not poor. 
</P>
<P>
So far, in 1989, seven homes have been -- or are being -- constructed in Salton 
City, capping several years of increasing housing construction. Most local 
residents bought property along the sea because they love open spaces, desert 
sunshine and the seascape. They also had faith that the state would not allow 
the sea to die. 
</P>
<P>
Among our residents are a retired professional golfer, a former movie 
executive, a retired journalist, a former owner-manager of the American 
visitors' bureau of Madrid, Spain, several active and retired contractors and 
many military retirees. 
</P>
<P>
Salton City also houses the headquarters of the largest -- or at least the most

We do not complain about the 1930s time warp in which we are said to live and 
in which neighbors -- in the best American tradition -- come to the aid of 
others in distress. 
</P>
<P>
We also welcome members of ethnic groups who come to us as visitors or 
residents, and we believe it is wonderful that so many people of modest means 
have a large recreational area in which to disport themselves. 
</P>
<P>
We do not believe "gentrification" of the area will occur, as the sea and 
surrounding area are far too large. At most this process might affect the north 
shore area, but we would be delighted to see even this happen if it would save 
the sea.

MANAGUA'S FAILING ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A secret report prepared for the Sandinista government confirms a widely held 
suspicion that the Nicaraguan economy is in bad shape and getting worse. While 
the Bush Administration may take some satisfaction from that, U.S. officials 
should also seize the opportunity for a more constructive relationship between 
Washington and Managua. 
</P>
<P>
The confidential study was prepared by an international team of experts for 
President Daniel Ortega, who used the findings on a trip to Europe last month 
seeking foreign assistance for his war-torn nation. A key conclusion is that 
Nicaragua's once-thriving economy has shrunk by one- third since dictator 
Anastasio Somoza was overthrown in 1979. In at least some statistical 
categories, Nicaragua is now the poorest Western Hemisphere nation, below 
poverty-stricken Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
The report, made public recently by the New York Times, does not try to assess 
blame for Nicaragua's economic devastation. The Sandinistas blame their 
problems on Somoza, who looted the national treasury before fleeing the 
country, and on the United States, which has supported both a war and a trade 
embargo against them. Sandinista opponents claim they created their own mess by 
driving the best of the professional class out of the country and relying, 
instead, on the advice and assistance of Communist allies like Cuba and the 
Soviet Union, economies hardly worth emulating. 
</P>
<P>
But the report is forthright in setting out the difficult steps that must be 
taken if the downward trend is to be reversed. Among them are a drastic cut in 
military spending and a renewed emphasis on private sector production. Those 
two proposals, in particular, should interest U.S. policy-makers, for they deal 
with Washington's two primary concerns about Nicaragua. A cutback in military 
spending would mean less Sandinista reliance on the Soviet Bloc, which can 
provide weaponry far more efficiently than it can provide food and other 
consumer goods. And a revived private sector would be a political 
counterbalance to the Sandinistas as they stumble about trying to turn 
Nicaragua into a one-party socialist state. 
</P>
<P>
As the preeminent economic power in the Western Hemisphere, the United States 
has always been the most logical place for Nicaragua to sell its goods and find 
investors. Even a hostile regime there can be swayed more easily by economic 
incentives than by military threats. Now that former President Reagan's 
unshakable hatred of the Sandinistas does not confine U.S. policy in Nicaragua 
to the stick, President Bush should try the carrot, using economic incentives 
like an end to the trade embargo, to improve relations.

STRIPPING AWAY THE QUOTA BARNACLES; 
</P>
<P>
COURT HAS REAFFIRMED COMMITMENT TO CIVIL RIGHTS FOR ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM BRADFORD REYNOLDS, William Bradford Reynolds, a distinguished fellow 
in law at the National Legal Center for the Public Interest in Washington, was 
assistant attorney general for civil rights in the Reagan Administration. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court is closing the 1988 term with a ringing reaffirmation of 
America's unyielding commitment to civil rights for all its citizens, whatever 
their race, gender, religion or ethnic background. The principle of 
nondiscrimination, for which so many marched in the 1960s, has at last been 
stripped of the quota barnacles that became an encrusted feature in the 1970s 
and is once again restored atop the equal- opportunity pedestal. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the court has struggled to reach this point, speaking more often 
than not with multiple voices, and, in some instances, even with forked tongue. 
But a solid and reliable majority has emerged to provide the kind of clarity of 
thinking and purpose needed to fulfill Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream of a 
nation that will one day judge its children "not by the color of their skin but 
by the content of their character." 
</P>
<P>
What the Supreme Court held in its series of civil rights decisions can be 
simply stated: All who have a claim of discrimination, whether it moves in 
forward gear or reverse, shall have access to the courts (Martin vs. Wilkes). 
Once through the courthouse door, plaintiffs must prove their case, not simply 
by reference to statistical imbalances or numerical under-representation 
(although statistics are certainly an acceptable "starting point"), but also, 
and most important, with hard evidence showing that the disproportionate 
numbers are indeed the result of discriminatory conduct (Ward's Cove Packing 
Co. vs. Atonio). The remedy that then follows must be "narrowly tailored" to 
fit the proven wrong and cure the identified injury, not cast more broadly to 
provide group-oriented relief in the form of racial quotas or minority 
set-asides, except as a rare last resort measure (Richmond vs. J.A. Croson). 
</P>
<P>
The court's message is unmistakably clear. Discrimination, whether labeled 
benign or pernicious, will not be countenanced. This includes remedial programs 
that favor some but disfavor others because of race. The negative preference 
has at last been expunged from affirmative action. No more is race to be pitted 
against race for openings in the workplace or the classroom. Latinos, 
Asian-Americans, blacks, whites and all others are to be treated equally; none 
can use skin color or ethnic background for advantage, or turn to those 
characteristics to disadvantage others. 
</P>
<P>
No one loses under these court decisions; everyone is a winner. The promise of 
equality means nothing to anyone if it does not mean the same thing to 
everyone. What once was almost exclusively a black-white issue is that no more. 
Asian-Americans are outperforming other minorities in college admissions exams 
in such numbers that some universities have placed a quota limit on the number 
to be admitted under their so-called "affirmative action" programs (shades of 
an earlier discriminatory quota used against Jewish students seeking college 
admission). Latinos, too, often face employee preferences that benefit only 
blacks and women; there is nothing very "affirmative" about that action. 
</P>
<P>
We can now put such racially inspired programs behind us. The Supreme Court has 
said that all must play by the same rule and can expect the same intense 
scrutiny. Affirmative action in its traditional sense -- active recruitment, 
outreach and training programs to ensure a wide open selection process based on 
individual talent and worth -- is back in vogue, cleansed of the negative 
preference that has for too long needlessly and cynically divided society along 
racial lines. It is the content of one's character and quality of performance 
that must now determine who gets into and through school or is hired or 
promoted. No longer must minorities live with the nagging self-doubts that come 
with the certain knowledge that their "affirmative action" selection was under 
a more relaxed standard that devalued their achievement. Success will have to 
come the hard way: It must be earned. Is that not what equal opportunity and 
civil rights are all about? 
</P>
<P>
That is the question that will now be put to Congress as some disgruntled quota 
advocates take their cause to the Hill. The public-policy debate is one that 
should be waged. Stripped of all its polemical rhetoric, it reduces to a most 
straightforward question: Are we for or against resurrecting the negative 
preference of affirmative action? 
</P>
<P>
Do we want enforcement of our civil rights to depend on whether racial 
proportionality has been achieved or will be maintained? If so, Congress will 
have to legislate that employers run afoul of the civil-rights laws on no more 
than a statistical showing of racial imbalance in their work force. And if the 
"racial quota" is indeed to be the public-policy preference in this country for 
correcting under-representation -- if we are really intent on buying into 
"benign" discrimination as the corrective for that which is pernicious -- then 
it is for Congress to make that legislative judgment specifically. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court has declined such an invitation. It has recognized -- as 
should we all -- that the principle of nondiscrimination is indeed colorblind. 
For that ideal to be compromised, in whatever fashion and for whatever reason, 
is to lose the principle, perhaps forever, to the poorer compromise. I agree 
with the court's majority: We have fought for civil rights too often and too 
long to allow so ignoble a surrender of so important and so cherished an ideal.

DEAR UNCLE, PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN LAJOUS, Adrian Lajous has long been active in business and banking in 
Mexico and in multilateral organizations such as the World Bank, which he 
served as executive director. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Uncle Sam, put up or shut up. You are good at giving advice but you don't 
follow it yourself. That is your problem. Here in Mexico, our problem is that 
when we do pay attention to you, we cannot be sure that you will allow us to 
reap the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
You suggested that we balance our budget -- and we have done it because it 
makes sense -- even though you have an enormous deficit every year because your 
expenditures surpass your income. We now have a healthy surplus in our primary 
budget. If it weren't for debt service, we would come out ahead each year. 
</P>
<P>
You persuaded us to stop protecting our industry and this has forced us to 
become export-oriented. But our new foreign trade surplus is rather precarious 
due to your denied but effective protectionist proclivity. 
</P>
<P>
Since World War II, you have consistently spoken in favor of free trade. 
Indeed, you did believe in it as long as you were the most efficient producer 
in the world. But once others began to nose you out in specific goods, you 
began to zero in with specific protection: "voluntary" quotas, multilateral 
"agreements," outright prohibitions, all kinds of nontariff barriers. And you 
seldom speak of free trade in agricultural products, never in the case of those 
you grow. All in all, you are estimated to be excluding many billion dollars' 
worth of exports from other countries, a good half by means of one so-called 
agreement imposed on fibers alone. 
</P>
<P>
You have advised us to let in foreign investment, and we have because we need 
new risk capital -- foreign funds and the money that our own investors exported 
to your banks. But there won't be massive flows unless and until investors know 
that they will be able to export their products to you. It's too dangerous to 
invest millions in a new factory only to find the door closed once we prove our 
capacity to export successfully. You have, Uncle Sam, a reputation for 
forgetting all about the benefits of free trade once your manufacturers or 
unions get upset about competition. 
</P>
<P>
Let us give you some advice, Uncle. Balance your budget. We know that when our 
neighbor's house begins to burn, the flames will reach ours. So we are not 
happy to see embers glowing on your roof. Do whatever is necessary. But take 
your hits and take them now. 
</P>
<P>
Take whatever measures are needed to expand your exports to be the equivalent 
of your imports. 
</P>
<P>
Gently bury your sunset industries. Concentrate on those things you do best. 
Don't encourage aged industrial sectors to hide behind their government-issue 
security blanket. Make them face up to the real world. 
</P>
<P>
Train displaced workers to qualify for other fields of work where higher 
productivity will bring larger rewards. Don't condemn them to spend their lives 
in jobs kept alive through intravenous feeding. 
</P>
<P>
Do what you keep telling us to do. Modernize. Rationalize. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever you do for your own benefit, let us sell to you whatever we can 
produce competitively as a result of our own ongoing modernization and 
rationalization. It is to take advantage of these actions that some of us here 
in Mexico want a free-trade agreement with you. This would give us a reasonable 
degree of guarantee of access to your market. It would permit Mexico to replace 
the products of the sunset industries that you will have to phase out in the 
next decade. In exchange, we can offer you a hundred million potential buyers 
for your sunrise industries in the next decade. Their purchasing power is, of 
course, less than the same number of Americans', but it will be rising again 
during the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, those of us who have faith that we will be able to compete with the 
"colossus of the north" are still a minority. But if you are willing to open 
your doors in tandem with us, we are willing to work on our more timorous 
fellow citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Come on, Uncle Sam. You do your thing, we'll do ours.

WHY CUT THE TIES THAT BIND IN CHINA? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERNEST CONINE, Ernest Conine writes a column for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush is under growing pressure from Congress to impose tough economic 
sanctions on China in retaliation for the murderous suppression of 
pro-democracy demonstrations and the executions that have followed. The impulse 
is honorable and humane, but the President should hold firm in the long-term 
interests of the United States and the Chinese people themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration has condemned the Chinese government's "outrageous" 
treatment of the demonstrators, halted U.S. military sales to China, suspended 
all high-level visits between U.S. and Chinese officials and served notice that 
the United States will do all it can to stall action on China's international 
loan applications. Other options will be considered if the brutality continues. 
</P>
<P>
The President also has expressed his reluctance to see a "total break" in 
relations, because it is important to preserve, if possible, the economic and 
strategic relationships that have been carefully cultivated over the past 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The use of stronger language might have been appropriate. In substantive terms, 
however, Bush's "measured response" is endorsed by most U.S. experts on China 
and, according to the polls, is supported so far by the public. There is 
nevertheless a chorus of demands from Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell 
and others that stronger actions be taken. 
</P>
<P>
The calls for tougher measures were inevitable. Whenever one country or another 
breaks the rules of civilized behavior, the instinctive U.S. reaction has long 
been to withhold trade, capital and technology -- unilaterally, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
The habit of go-it-alone sanctions began in the postwar era when American 
domination of the world economy was so great, and our trade and investment 
position so strong, that economic action was an attractive and not very costly 
medium for the expression of moral outrage. 
</P>
<P>
But sanctions didn't work very well even when America was undisputed king of 
the hill. They are even less effective now. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. economic leverage has failed to bring down Fidel Castro in Cuba or the 
Sandinistas in Nicaragua. American curbs on trade with the two major sources of 
terrorism, Iran and Libya, have proved ineffective. Neither Bush nor Ronald 
Reagan has been able to strangle the nauseous, pipsqueak regime of Gen. Manuel 
A. Noriega in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
As Bush says, keep in mind also that global U.S. interests are involved in 
China. First, we have long-term commercial interests to protect. Since 1980, 
more than$25 billion in foreign investment has flowed into China. U.S. 
companies have established a good foothold in the potentially huge Chinese 
market. Given the shaky state of this country's world-trade position, that 
stake should not be surrendered except in joint action with Japan and other 
major competitors. And no such collective sanctions are in prospect. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany, Italy, Britain and most other allied governments have issued 
strong verbal protests against the monstrous behavior of the Beijing regime and 
have put diplomatic relations on hold. There is no visible willingness, 
however, to impose actual economic sanctions. Japan, which provides more than 
half of China's development aid, has bluntly rejected the idea of sanctions and 
urged Washington and others to do the same. The Soviet Union has held back even 
from plain-talk denunciation of the events in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Remember, too, that military and diplomatic cooperation with China serves U.S. 
interests; U.S.-run electronic surveillance stations in northern China provide 
invaluable intelligence on Soviet compliance with arms-control agreements. 
Chinese cooperation is vital to peace and stability in Southeast Asia and to 
U.S. efforts to head off the dangerous spread of long-range missiles to the 
volatile Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
We will be wiser to play for the revival of the forces for change in China. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest liberalizing influence in China is the country's decade-old 
economic opening to the West, which has brought large-scale exposure to Western 
businessmen, scholars, journalists and tourists. Within far more generous 
bounds than in the Soviet Union, private enterprise has been legalized. 
</P>
<P>
A whole generation of educated young Chinese has been exposed to Western ideas 
of democracy and economic development, either in China or in studies abroad. We 
saw them in Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
How does it serve U.S. interests or those of pro-democracy Chinese to strangle 
the economic ties that gave birth to the protest movement in the first place? 
It would be far better to continue nurturing, to the extent possible, a 
modernization process that will make the skills of pro-democracy Chinese 
essential -- and ultimately force the regime to make the political reforms 
necessary to harness those skills. 
</P>
<P>
If the arrests and executions continue, George Bush may be unable to avoid a 
deep and prolonged rupture in relations. But if that happens, the people hurt 
most won't be the hard old men in Beijing but the very Chinese we would like to 
help.

STATE DROPOUT REPORT IRKS SOME DISTRICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials of suburban school districts that fared well in the newly released 
state survey of dropout rates commended the report while officials of districts 
that did poorly say the arithmetic of state schools Supt. Bill Honig just 
doesn't add up. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a false measure," said David Aponik, director of management information 
services for the 11,500-student Burbank Unified School District. Honig's report 
said that district had a 24.1% dropout rate over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
"If the intent is to wake up communities and school districts, we have no 
problem with that; but let's play fair," Aponik said. "Our beef is with the 
state for using a faulty methodology." 
</P>
<P>
Susie Lange, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Education, defended the 
state's calculations. She said that for the last three years districts have 
been required to submit dropout statistics each fall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dropout Rate 
</P>
<P>
The dropout rate was derived from the sophomore class that enrolled in the fall 
of 1985 and graduated in the spring of 1988. Each year, districts were required 
to submit the number of dropouts from that class. To get a percentage, the 
total number of dropouts from that class over three years was divided by the 
number originally enrolled as sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
The dropout percentages do not include students who have moved to other 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've derived comes out of what numbers they sent us," Lange said. "Our 
reporting system is totally dependent on the diligence of people on the local 
level." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the confusion, she said, comes because school districts normally 
calculate their dropout rates on a yearly basis. The state numbers cover a 
three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wrong Figures 
</P>
<P>
Still, Aponik and officials from other districts that showed high dropout rates 
-- such as the Moorpark, Antelope Valley and Oak Park unified school districts 
-- say the state figures are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
In the tiny Oak Park Unified School District, which is in an affluent area of 
southeastern Ventura County, the state reported a 17% dropout rate for students 
who enrolled as sophomores in the fall of 1985. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert Sutton, former principal of the district's only high school, said he 
can't recall more than five students who dropped out of the 360-student Oak 
Park High School in the past six years. "It's got to be an error," said Sutton, 
who left the school in November to become a district administrator. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley Unified Supt. Kenneth Brummel said the state numbers do not 
account for a significant number of students who fail to graduate with their 
class because they are held back a grade. He said the dropout rate among the 
district's three high schools is closer to 12%, rather than the 40% listed in 
the state report. 
</P>
<P>
But officials of the Glendale Unified School District, which had a 13.1% 
dropout rate, said the state report is accurate. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been losing a little more than 4% a year," said Gary Hess, the 
district's director of student services. "I feel good about it." 
</P>
<P>
Aggressive dropout prevention programs in Glendale and eastern Ventura County's 
Conejo Valley Unified School District have reduced the problem, officials of 
those districts said. 
</P>
<P>
The Conejo district, which serves the predominantly white and 
upper-middle-class city of Thousand Oaks, had only a 7.3% dropout rate over 
three years. That low percentage comes from good school programs and high 
expectations by area parents, Assistant Supt. Richard Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Education is highly valued in this community," Simpson said. "About 75% to 80% 
of our seniors start college." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SCHOOL DROPOUT RATES 
</P>
<P>
Chart shows dropout rates for various valley-area districts. The rate is a 
percentage calculated by counting the dropouts from the 10th-grade class of 
1985-86 as it continued through high school, then dividing the total number of 
dropouts by the original 10th-grade enrollment.

MAN HELD IN DEATHS OF 2 UNIVERSAL STUDIOS GUARDS; 
</P>
<P>
MURDER DEFENDANT RULED COMPETENT FOR TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A former mental patient accused of shooting to death two Universal Studios 
security guards that he believed were Nazis is competent to stand trial, a Los 
Angeles Superior Court judge ruled Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing a report from a court-appointed psychiatrist, Judge Florence 
Bernstein ruled that Nathan Trupp, 43, has been restored to competency with the 
use of psychotropic drugs and will be able to assist in his defense. 
</P>
<P>
"The defendant is presently competent to stand trial," Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
However, the judge said Trupp's grasp of competency was "fairly tenuous" and 
she ordered that he be closely monitored while in the Los Angeles County Jail 
to be sure that he takes the drugs ordered by psychiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein ordered Trupp to be arraigned on first-degree murder charges July 5. 
A preliminary hearing will be scheduled after Trupp pleads to charges that he 
fatally shot Jeren Beeks, 27, and Armando Torres, 18, on Dec. 1 at the main 
gate to Universal Studios. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turned Away 
</P>
<P>
The two unarmed security guards were shot moments after they had turned Trupp 
away from the gate. Authorities said Trupp had walked up to the gate and asked 
to see actor Michael Landon. 
</P>
<P>
Trupp is also accused of shooting three people to death in an Albuquerque, 
N.M., bagel shop two days before the Universal Studios slayings. After the five 
slayings, he told investigators and psychiatrists that he believed that the 
victims were Nazis who were conspiring against him. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles case against Trupp will proceed before he faces charges in New 
Mexico, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Trupp, in yellow fatigues worn by prisoners housed in the County Jail's ward 
for the mentally ill, was in Superior Court for the brief competency hearing 
Tuesday. He only spoke once -- to tell the judge in which jail ward he was 
being kept. The bearded suspect's right arm, which was wounded during a brief 
gun battle with a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy during his capture, was 
wrapped in plastic and is still healing. 
</P>
<P>
Trupp was found incompetent to stand trial in February and was sent to Patton 
State Hospital, a facility in San Bernardino County for the criminally insane. 
Last month, psychiatrists at Patton certified that Trupp was competent and 
ready to go to trial. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Evaluation 
</P>
<P>
He was then examined by Dr. Kaushal K. Sharma, one of two independent 
psychiatrists who had earlier found Trupp incompetent. Sharma's new evaluation, 
which was not released to the public, said Trupp was competent. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Linda B. Greenberg said the improvement in Trupp's mental 
state between the two evaluations was the result of the use of the psychotropic 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"At Patton, he was given medication to restore his competency," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Defender Philomene Swenson said the drugs Trupp is taking allow 
him to speak rationally with his attorneys and to make decisions concerning his 
defense. She would not identify the drugs used but said Trupp is willingly 
taking them. 
</P>
<P>
"He is ready to go back to criminal court," Swenson said. "I think he is 
rationally able to cooperate with counsel and able to discuss things that he 
was too sick to discuss before." 
</P>
<P>
Swenson declined to say whether Trupp would plead not guilty by reason of 
insanity to the charges but did say, "Nathan is mentally ill."

DAY IN COURT; 
</P>
<P>
CROWDS FORCE WHEELS OF JUSTICE TO TURN QUICKLY

Ramon Parra of Pacoima came to the San Fernando Courthouse's arraignment court 
Tuesday to clear up a traffic ticket. But when his name was called once, then 
twice, and it was pronounced "Ray-mond" instead of "Rah-moan" both times, Parra 
didn't realize that it was his turn. 
</P>
<P>
If a translator had not stepped forward and pronounced the name correctly, it 
would have been too late -- Commissioner Gerald Richardson would already have 
set Parra's file aside and called the next case. Parra would have had to wait 
several hours until the end of the day when Richardson makes a second call of 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
Court officials say a frenetic pace has become standard in San Fernando 
Municipal Court's Division 130, one of the busiest courtrooms in the Los 
Angeles County court system. In something of a judicial assembly line, 
Richardson may process as many as 350 cases a day. 
</P>
<P>
While other courts in the building usually close by 4:30 p.m., Richardson said 
he at times is still arraigning people at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The division has seen a 40% increase in its daily caseload over last year. And 
to cope with the heavy flow of cases, Richardson arraigns people nonstop at a 
rate of one per minute. 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom handles the arraignment for every case that comes to the San 
Fernando Courthouse -- from minor traffic violations to misdemeanors to 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
The high caseload also translates into crowding in the courtroom as scores of 
defendants, their families and friends wait for hours until their cases are 
called. On Monday, the Los Angeles Fire Department cited the courtroom as a 
fire hazard because of the crowding and blocked aisle exits. 
</P>
<P>
"The volume of people coming here is ridiculous," said court interpreter Paula 
Krawec. "We are overworked and overstressed, and we can't even breathe." 
</P>
<P>
Many court officials say the daily caseload is too much for one courtroom and 
should be split up between two. 
</P>
<P>
"There are courts that do half as many cases with twice as much staff," said 
Bob Jason, a deputy public defender. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Traffic Cases 
</P>
<P>
Traffic violators may soon be handled in a separate courtroom, court officials 
hope, which will take about 90 minutes worth of cases out of Division 130. 
Until then, however, they will continue to contribute to the general crowding 
of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
The moment the doors opened at 8:45 a.m. Tuesday, a throng of people pressed 
though the narrow doorway into the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Representing a cross-section of America, the defendants in Division 130 were 
all ages, races, creeds and economic levels. Many were dressed in grubby work 
clothes and baseball caps; a few wore expensive suits and carried briefcases. 
</P>
<P>
"Every element of society comes through here, from rich businessmen who were 
speeding in their Mercedes on the freeways to the gang-bang murderers," 
Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All-Day Wait 
</P>
<P>
Despite the differences that separated the defendants in the outside world, all 
were equal in Division 130. Each was ordered to the court at 9 a.m. and faced 
the prospect of an all-day wait. Those who were late and missed Richardson's 
reading of their constitutional rights were asked to return the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Several Spanish interpreters are always in court to translate for the dozens of 
Latino defendants who don't speak English. On Tuesday, Richardson also called 
in Korean, Farsi and Arabic interpreters for other non-English-speaking 
defendants. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson arraigned people one at a time, in case after case, taking pleas and 
dispensing verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
The monotony was broken when Richardson arraigned 12 men at once. Each had been 
charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and each pleaded guilty. 
The entire procedure took less than five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Many defendants may be left bewildered by the brief proceedings, Richardson 
said. But "I give them a written copy of everything I said," he said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An attorney who failed to show up to testify at the preliminary hearing of 
accused madam Karen Wilkening was found in contempt of court Tuesday and fined 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wesley Harris, 56, who specializes in personal injury lawsuits, allegedly was a 
customer of Wilkening's call-girl ring. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal Court Judge Fred Link entered the finding Tuesday after Judge Lisa 
Guy-Schall recused herself from the case. Harris' attorney, Nelson Brav, had 
requested Guy-Schall's removal, saying that she had been angered and 
inconvenienced by Harris' non-appearance and that another judge should hear the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
Guy-Schall dismissed two counts of pimping against Wilkening because of Harris' 
failure to show up. 
</P>
<P>
Harris was was subpoenaed to testify a month ago by the district attorney's 
office, but, according to Brav, Harris went on a vacation that week. His 
recreational vehicle broke down in Pine Valley one day, Brav said, and on the 
final day of the hearing, Harris was suddenly hospitalized on his doctor's 
recommendation because of high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkening, 42, faces trial on Aug. 4 on prostitution charges. A separate case 
is also set for Aug. 4, and prosecutors are seeking to have them tried 
together.

L.A. OKS SAN FERNANDO FIRE SERVICE PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Fire Department will continue to provide fire service to the 
city of San Fernando for the next five years under a new contract approved 
Tuesday by the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the new contract had stirred debate for months in San Fernando after 
Los Angeles city officials issued an ultimatum to the small city to stop 
selling Fourth of July fireworks or forfeit fire service after Friday, when the 
present contract expires. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando City Council banned the sale of fireworks last winter after 
months of studying what council members concluded were inadequate alternatives, 
such as starting a San Fernando fire department or contracting with Los Angeles 
County. Fireworks had been sold in the city for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, San Fernando will pay $1.5 million this year -- an 
increase of about $52,000 -- for fire and paramedic service. Future fees will 
be calculated annually by Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando City Council approved the contract agreement June 19. One term 
of the new agreement sets up a liaison between the city and the Los Angeles 
Fire Department so that San Fernando is aware of fire prevention and other 
public programs.

ERODED TRAIL BLAMED; 
</P>
<P>
L.A. APPROVES $385,714 FOR INJURED HORSEWOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale woman who fell while riding a horse on a Los Angeles bridle trail 
and injured her leg will be paid $385,714 in damages by the city because its 
parks department failed to properly maintain the trail, the City Council agreed 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Miriam Dow, 42, was riding her horse down an equestrian ramp along the Los 
Angeles River Basin on Dec. 5, 1985, when the horse slipped and fell on Dow's 
left leg, breaking it. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of surgery, in which a steel rod was inserted, Dow's leg was 
shortened nearly an inch. She now limps, suffers from chronic pain and is 
unable to walk long distances and play tennis or other sports, a city 
attorney's report said. 
</P>
<P>
In February, a Los Angeles Superior Court civil trial jury found that the Los 
Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks had maintained the river ramps in 
poor condition by failing to properly pack the cement paths with dirt to 
prevent horses from slipping. The jury awarded Dow the $385,714 that the 
council approved. 
</P>
<P>
Dow rode on the trail about a week after heavy rains had washed away part of 
the dirt, causing her horse to slip. City crews had not yet replaced the dirt 
on an exposed 5- to 6-foot section where the horse slipped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caution Sign 
</P>
<P>
Her attorneys contended that at least a caution sign should have been posted at 
the entrance, warning users that erosion occurs after rainfall. 
</P>
<P>
City parks officials said a caution sign has been installed at the trail's 
entrance, warning users to "proceed at their own risk." 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of jury sympathy," said Deputy City Atty. Mary E. House, who 
tried the case. "Her attorneys argued that the ramps were dangerous conditions 
for public property." 
</P>
<P>
The judge denied a city request for a new trial, House said. 
</P>
<P>
In recommending to the City Council that the award be paid, the city attorney 
stated that further appeals were not warranted because "there was sufficient 
evidence to support the verdict and there were not errors of the law committed 
during the trial." 
</P>
<P>
The council unanimously approved the payment without comment and sent the item 
to Mayor Tom Bradley for approval.

GALLEGLY REQUEST;

<P>
EPA PLANS INSPECTION OF FIELD LAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in response to a request by Rep. 
Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), is sending an inspector to Rockwell 
International's Santa Susana Field Laboratory west of Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
The inspector will review the company's records and look at the 2,668-acre 
laboratory, where low-level radioactive and chemical contamination has been 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not an emergency, and anyone who says it is is blowing this out of 
proportion," said EPA spokesman Al Zemsky. "We were requested to take this role 
and we did -- we already know there is no imminent health threat up there." 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly asked the agency last week to take a more active role in supervising 
the laboratory because he was concerned about reports of pollution, said Mike 
Sedell, Gallegly's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
"The congressman is pleased that the EPA is taking this seriously," Sedell 
said. "There is no physical evidence of any imminent health danger up there, 
but we would like the EPA to take a look." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EPA Meeting 
</P>
<P>
Zemsky said that until Gallegly made his request, the EPA had been allowing 
state regulatory agencies, such as the Department of Health Services, to take 
the lead role at the field lab, which is two miles southeast of Simi Valley. 
Zemsky said the EPA will hold a meeting in Los Angeles either Friday or Monday 
to discuss the situation at the lab with representatives from other agencies, 
such as the state health department and the U.S. Department of Energy, which 
has contracted with Rockwell for energy research. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1947 and 1986, Rockwell operated about 16 nuclear reactors at the Santa 
Susana field lab. A recent energy department report said there are about 10 
slightly contaminated sites at the lab and recommended that the firm drill more 
wells to monitor ground water. Rockwell has since said it will put in 18 
additional wells.

EX-GLOBETROTTER TO PICK UP BALL IN NBA PURSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN HEWITT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mannie L. Jackson, a Honeywell Inc. executive and former Harlem Globetrotter, 
will detail his plans to bring the National Basketball Assn. back to San Diego 
at a Sports Arena press conference Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, now based in Minneapolis, is the latest puzzle piece in La Jolla 
multimillionaire Harry Cooper's attempts to build a 22,900-seat indoor arena 
aimed at inducing the National Hockey League to expand to San Diego while 
simultaneously luring the NBA back to this city. 
</P>
<P>
"Smart guy, bright guy, VP at Honeywell, gotta be doing something right," said 
former NFL defensive lineman Alan Page, now a lawyer, when asked about Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Page has worked with Jackson in minority youth programs in Minnesota and said 
he has discussed with Jackson the plans to obtain the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Page said it is his understanding that Jackson will be the "primary owner" if 
the league grants the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he'd be a sharp owner," Page said. "I think he'd be great." It is also 
believed that Jackson would also be the league's first black principal owner. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Cooper said Jackson has already met with NBA Commissioner 
David Stern and will file an application for an expansion franchise at the 
league's next Board of Governors meetings. 
</P>
<P>
But the NBA repeatedly has said it has no immediate desire to grow past the 27 
teams it will field in 1989-90. And it said so again Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no interest in expansion," said Russ Granik, the league's executive 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
That was after Granik had been read the contents of the press release 
distributed to sports media outlets in San Diego. The release didn't identify 
Jackson by name, only as a "business executive." But Page and a source familiar 
with San Diego's efforts to land an NBA franchise confirmed that the "business 
executive" was Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson did not return phone messages left at his home by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The press release, which Cooper later said wasn't supposed to be distributed 
until today, also described this "business executive" as a man who will 
"announce his plans and outline his philosophy of how the future franchise will 
be involved in the community" at the Thursday press conference. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA has tried and failed in San Diego twice. The Clippers moved to Los 
Angeles May 15, 1984, after six seasons in San Diego during which they had only 
one winning record and no appearances in the playoffs. Before that, the San 
Diego Rockets played four seasons here before moving to Houston after the 
1970-71 season. 
</P>
<P>
But Cooper insists the NBA has never gotten a fair chance here. And one Cooper 
aide said San Diego is the "most wired" city in the country for cable 
television and pay per view potential. 
</P>
<P>
Cable television is one the league's major criteria in gauging the health of a 
franchise. It is Cooper's plan that an NBA or NHL franchise would play in the 
Sports Arena he now owns until his sports "palace" is ready for operation. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known where Jackson's financial backing would come from. 
But if he assumes the title of owner or managing partner, that would be a major 
step forward in the league's efforts at promoting affirmative action. 
</P>
<P>
Before joining the Globetrotters, Jackson played for University of Illinois 
basketball teams from 1958 to 1960. He captained the team in the 1959-60 season 
and was an honorable-mention All-American in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
At Honeywell he started a program called "Best Shot" that encouraged young 
minority athletes to be serious about getting a good education by using 
athletic role models. Former Vikings Page and John Henderson are also involved 
in the program. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's current title with Honeywell is national sales vice president of the 
company's Commercial Buildings Group. That division has an office on Convoy 
Street in San Diego. "Mannie is a very peripatetic individual who's going 24 
hours a day," said Louis Navin, Honeywell's former chief financial officer. 
"He's the kind of sports figure you would love to have in your town. It's San 
Diego's gain and Minneapolis' loss." 
</P>
<P>
Before joining Honeywell, Jackson worked at General Motors.

ALWORTH WAS A PRIZE CATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WOLF

SAN DIEGO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fittingly, a fellow Hall of Famer gives the quintessential testimonial to the 
pass-catching ability of Lance Alworth. 
</P>
<P>
Says Sid Gillman: "Lance is all-time all-pro in my book, a great athlete and a 
great competitor." 
</P>
<P>
There probably is no one better qualified than Gillman to venture such an 
opinion. He is known as the guru of the passing game, an innovator who 
developed many of the ideas in vogue today. 
</P>
<P>
Gillman was the Chargers' first coach, Alworth their first superstar. Alworth 
was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978, the first American 
Football League player to be so honored. Gillman was elected five years later. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the greatest combination runner, jumper and catcher I ever saw," 
Gillman said. "His sense of timing was so great that with him out there, we 
felt that the fly pattern was no more a gamble than a run." 
</P>
<P>
Another glowing accolade came from someone Charger fans love to hate, Al Davis. 
The managing general partner of the Raiders was an assistant coach with the 
Chargers when Alworth was drafted out of Arkansas in 1962. It was Davis who 
beat the National Football League to the punch by signing Alworth after the 
Sugar Bowl game in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Said Davis: "Lance was one of maybe three players in my lifetime who had what I 
would call 'it.' You could see right away he was going to be special." 
</P>
<P>
This despite the fact that Alworth had had only a smattering of receiving 
experience in college. He was a running back under Coach Frank Broyles at 
Arkansas, and estimated that he "might have caught 20 passes in three seasons 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Alworth adjusted so well to his new role that in 11 pro seasons, nine with the 
Chargers and two with the Dallas Cowboys, he caught 542 passes for an 18.9-yard 
average and 85 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
In a seven-season stretch covering 1963 through 1969, Alworth's reception 
totals were 61, 61 again, 69, 73, 52, 68 and 64. In the first six of those 
seasons, his averages per catch were 19.8, 20.2, 23.2, 18.9, 19.4 and 19.3. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Hennigan of Houston caught 410 passes in only seven seasons and set a 
pro single-season record of 101 (since broken) in 1964, but he had no illusions 
about who was the dominant receiver of his day. 
</P>
<P>
After retiring in 1966, Hennigan said, "A player comes along once in a lifetime 
who alone is worth the price of admission. That player is Lance Alworth." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Alworth's nickname of Bambi, dreamed up by running back Charlie 
Flowers, tells best what kind of receiver he was. He had great speed, a long 
stride, quick feet and leaping ability that inspired defensive back Ron Hall of 
the Boston Patriots to remark, "I think he trains on a trampoline." 
</P>
<P>
It's conceivable that Alworth, not a big guy at 6 feet and 180 pounds, could 
have avoided the physical beating he took in football by accepting a bonus 
offer from the New York Yankees. He was an outstanding center fielder in 
college. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Alworth was good at every sport he tried. He won 15 letters in high 
school in Brookhaven, Miss., and set freshman sprint records of 9.6 and 21.2 in 
the 100- and 220-yard dashes at Arkansas. He also played basketball, but said, 
"That wasn't one of my stronger sports." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Alworth, 48, runs a storage company in Solana Beach, but his path to 
success in business hasn't been as easy as it was in football. He once had a 
dry-cleaning business that foundered. 
</P>
<P>
"I went through bankruptcy in '68 and '69," he said. "The man who was supposed 
to handle my money didn't do it, so I learned a good lesson. I decided to 
handle it myself, and I've had a nice little business here for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We build and manage mini-storage facilities, and we recently closed a deal 
with a big New York firm. It's not necessarily lucrative, but being with them 
has added a lot of credibility to what we do. I like being recognized as a 
decent businessman, not just an ex-football player." 
</P>
<P>
Alworth was born a generation too soon to hit big money in football. He 
originally signed with the Chargers for $20,000 a year for two years, plus a 
$10,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a career high of $50,000 my last two years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The only reason Alworth got as much as he did as a rookie was the bidding war 
between the AFL and NFL. He was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the first 
round and by the Chargers in the second. 
</P>
<P>
"The AFL had an early draft, and Dallas, now Kansas City, drafted me," Alworth 
said. "We didn't have agents then, and I went in to see Lamar Hunt in Dallas. 
He asked me if I'd sign for $10,000 a year and a $2,000 bonus. I said, 'No, 
sir. I'll go to law school before I'll sign for that.' 
</P>
<P>
"They canceled that draft for some reason, and the next time, Dallas didn't 
draft me. It was San Francisco and San Diego, and Al Davis worked on me pretty 
hard. I talked to the 49er coach, Red Hickey, and told him I wanted a no-cut 
contract. He said they didn't give such things, so I walked out. Then he said, 
'We'll give you one,' but I said to myself, 'I don't need this.' 
</P>
<P>
"I never talked to the 49ers again, plus I loved Al Davis. My parents did, too, 
so the decision was easy." 
</P>
<P>
Alworth recalled his struggle to learn the art of receiving as a rookie with 
the Chargers. Their quarterback was Jack Kemp, later a congressman and now 
secretary of housing and urban development. 
</P>
<P>
"Kemp threw passes 90 miles an hour," Alworth said. "He could fire it. I was 
running quick out patterns, and I wasn't catching the ball. I dropped a couple 
of balls that hit me right in the hands. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so bad that one day they made me stay after practice. Joe Madro, the 
offensive line coach, was there, and I heard him say, 'We made a mistake on 
this guy.' Fortunately, I finally started catching the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Once Alworth caught on, the Chargers' only regret about the 1962 draft was 
picking fullback Bob Ferguson of Ohio State ahead of him. Ferguson not only 
didn't sign, he was a monumental flop. He lasted only two seasons with the 
Pittsburgh Steelers, who also drafted him No. 1, and gained a total of 209 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Ferguson and I were with the College All-Stars, and I was surprised he wasn't 
bigger," Alworth said. "I thought he was a real bruiser. At that time, guys in 
the Big Ten got all the press." 
</P>
<P>
Once Alworth perfected moves to complement his natural ability, he drove rival 
defensive backs up the wall. He caught at least one pass in all 96 AFL games in 
which he played. He made the AFL's all-league team seven years in a row and was 
elected unanimously to the AFL's all-time all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
Alworth played hurt, too, despite his fragile build. In 1966, he caught 37 
passes in a seven-game span in which he had both arms in casts because of wrist 
and hand injuries. 
</P>
<P>
In his second year, 1963, Alworth had one game in which he caught 13 passes and 
another in which he totaled 232 yards. He was the biggest single reason why the 
Chargers won their only AFL championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I had one of the best 'up' moves, and a great 'out' move," Alworth said. "My 
corner move was terrible, though. I was so quick, I made my cuts so fast that I 
never really gave my quarterbacks (primarily John Hadl) time to follow me in. 
</P>
<P>
"I had good hand-and-eye coordination and was blessed with above-average speed, 
but my quickness was the biggest factor. I was unorthodox in that I caught 
everything in my stomach. I didn't like to catch balls above my head, because 
if I got hit, I might have dropped them." 
</P>
<P>
Alworth gave much of the credit for his success to Gillman. "Sid was probably 
the greatest offensive mind ever to coach the game," he said, "and I feel that 
he was 50% or more responsible for my success. Even though they played a lot of 
zone then, he figured out ways to get us in one-on-one situations. He was 20 
years ahead of his time." 
</P>
<P>
The champion Chargers of 1963 were so good that Alworth said, "We felt we could 
have beaten anybody in either league. We had everything going offensively, and 
what people didn't realize is that we were also a great defensive team." 
</P>
<P>
One of Alworth's happiest moments was watching Joe Namath and the Jets upset 
the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no resentment against the NFL until they said we couldn't play with 
them," Alworth said. "Everybody talked about the debacles of the first two 
Super Bowls when Green Bay won, but they didn't realize that Green Bay beat 
everybody like that. Everybody in the NFL behind Green Bay was just another 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt that Kansas City wasn't our best team for Super Bowl I. I thought there 
were three teams that were better, and that we were one of the three. I was in 
the stands when the Jets did it, and I was yelling, 'Go, Joe.' I haven't been 
much more excited in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Of all enemy cornerbacks, Alworth had his most memorable duels with Fred (The 
Hammer) Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
When Alworth was a rookie in 1962,, Williamson said he didn't have any moves. 
After a Charger-Raider game a year later, he said, "Go ask Sid Gillman how many 
passes Alworth caught. I caught more than he did, and I play defense." 
</P>
<P>
Recalling Williamson's remarks, Alworth said, "I told Freddy one time, 'I'm 
tired of this.' He said, 'You don't understand. We've got to keep this thing 
going. I want to be known as the Cassius Clay of the AFL.' 
</P>
<P>
"After that, I said to Sid (Gillman), 'Put me on this kid. If you don't run me 
against him, I'm not going to play.' Sid said it would be easier on the other 
side, but he went along with me. I caught two touchdowns and went for 96 yards 
against Williamson. He never said anything to any of us after that." 
</P>
<P>
Alworth surprised a lot of people when he chose Davis to present him at the 
Hall of Fame ceremony in Canton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody got a little angry with me for that," Alworth said. "But Al was like 
a father to me, and he still calls my mom and dad. The thing about him that 
nobody knows is that he has helped a lot of people, guys out of work, and not 
just ex-Raiders but guys who played on other teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe Al is totally misunderstood. To me, he's a gem." 
</P>
<P>
Alworth's election to the Hall of Fame meant even more to him than a just 
reward for his achievements. 
</P>
<P>
"I called my dad and said, 'Dad, your son has just been voted into the Hall of 
Fame,' " Alworth said. "Then I started crying. I had been trying to prove 
myself to him ever since I was in ninth grade. 
</P>
<P>
"One night I scored two touchdowns, but he said to me, 'There were a couple of 
times tonight when you kind of dogged it. Remember, no matter how good you are, 
there is always somebody better.' 
</P>
<P>
"That brought me down to earth very quickly. It put everything in perspective 
for me."

TAGLIAFERRI REJECTS 'FINAL' TIGER OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gino Tagliaferri of Kennedy High, the 1989 Times' All-Valley Player of the 
Year, has declined an offer from the Detroit Tigers and will attend Fresno 
State in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliaferri met with Detroit representatives for three hours Tuesday night 
before rejecting what he said was "their final offer" of a $55,000 signing 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
"This is for sure," Tagliaferri said. "I wanted ($80,000) because that's what I 
feel I'm worth. I'll get school, a degree, good baseball and, hopefully, I'll 
get drafted even higher in three years."

PORTO JOINS MOORPARK AS ASSISTANT; 
</P>
<P>
MOORPARK HIGH LOSES COACH TO JUNIOR COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mario Porto, who last season guided Moorpark High to the baseball playoffs for 
the first time in 42 years, has resigned as coach to become an assistant at 
Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
Porto will join the staff of Ken Wagner, who was hired as Raider coach last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"I coached with Mario in several all-star games and have known him for a long 
time," said Wagner, who formerly coached at Camarillo High. "We're lucky he 
wants to coach with us. He felt, as I do, that it was a good opportunity to 
move up and coach at the college level." 
</P>
<P>
Wagner earlier had announced that Mel Bannon, his assistant at Camarillo, also 
would be joining the Moorpark staff. 
</P>
<P>
Porto, who teaches at Community High, a continuation school in Moorpark, was 
coach of Moorpark High's baseball team for four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
He was selected Ventura County Division II Coach of the Year by the county 
coaches' association last season after leading the Musketeers to a 15-7 record 
and a second-place tie with Fillmore in the Tri-Valley League. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark loses only three seniors from last season. Frank Fernandez, an 
All-Southern Section selection at shortstop, is among those expected to return. 
</P>
<P>
Porto said he recommended that Dave Rhoades, the Moorpark High junior varsity 
coach of three years, be named as his successor. 
</P>
<P>
"Dave knows all the kids and he is very good at what he does," Porto said. 
</P>
<P>
In other coaching moves involving Valley-area coaches, Brian York has resigned 
as baseball coach at North Hollywood High after five seasons and said that he 
will pursue a position as a professional scout or college assistant. 
</P>
<P>
York, who serves as a part-time scout for the Oakland A's, will remain at the 
school as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Pam Walker, the girls' basketball coach at Hart High, said that she will take a 
year's leave of absence in hopes of becoming a part-time assistant coach for 
the UCLA women's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
Walker guided Hart to the Southern Section 5-A Division championship last 
season.

DAVE DISTEL: LITTLE MONEY FOR THE FIRST MILE, LESS FOR EACH ADDITIONAL MILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dave Distel 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baseball's statistical nuts, and I confess that I may be one of them, are 
constantly coming up with new numerical twists on the grand old game. 
</P>
<P>
The latest, which popped into the computer system one afternoon this week, was 
a study by a University of Dayton economics professor. This one has to do with 
dollar signs rather than decimal points. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Hadley analyzed statistics as they relate to salaries and concluded 
that home runs are worth $4,283 per swat, hits $1,322 for even the softest 
broken bat bloop single and stolen bases $713 each, indicating maybe crime 
really doesn't pay. 
</P>
<P>
I thought of these numbers later that same afternoon when I was sitting on top 
of a picnic table on the shores of Mission Bay with a sweating fellow named 
Steve McCormack. I thought also that I would not mention that baseball players 
earn $4,283 for trotting 360 feet or $713 for dashing 90 feet. 
</P>
<P>
McCormack, you see, is a runner. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, he's a darn good one. 
</P>
<P>
A friend of mine, Ron Heifner, had brought him to my attention over the 
weekend. Heifner is also a runner, though he has dedicated his running career 
thus far to finding a field small enough or old enough for him to beat. 
</P>
<P>
McCormack impressed him in the YMCA Breakers 10-Mile Run Saturday at Mission 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy," Heifner said, "has a wife and two kids and works full time and 
still runs 100 miles a week. Then he goes out and runs 10 miles in 51:04 on the 
sand. He's got to be a good story." 
</P>
<P>
McCormack, who first attracted attention hereabouts while at Grossmont College, 
would be a good story. Thousands of San Diegans run and jog, but he has been 
one of the most prominent for quite some time. I figured he has probably 
parlayed this success to a comfortable home, maybe in Rancho Santa Fe, and a 
jet-setting life style going from one race or another in places such as Hawaii 
and Switzerland. No way this guy would need a full-time job. 
</P>
<P>
I expected McCormack to show up for the interview looking like one of those 
Indy racers, wearing so many sponsors' patches you wonder how they can move. I 
expected him to have an agent and maybe a publicist. 
</P>
<P>
He showed up wearing a nondescript T-shirt and plain sweat pants. Obviously, 
his sponsors would not be pleased. 
</P>
<P>
Your sponsors, Mac, what about your sponsors? 
</P>
<P>
"Big zip," he said. 
</P>
<P>
What? 
</P>
<P>
"If you're not running at an Olympic level, such as guys like Steve Scott, 
you're not making any money," he said. "The shoe companies, the mainstays of 
distance running, are cutting everybody out. It's not just me. I could give you 
name after name after name." 
</P>
<P>
And so McCormack really is working a 40-hour week? 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, he is liquor manager for a Clairemont drug store. He is a working 
stiff, a running fool and a husband and father. His wife, Theresa, a senior 
claims adjuster for an insurance company, jogs along -- not at her husband's 
pace, obviously -- with the two toddlers in a stroller. This family is on the 
move. 
</P>
<P>
However, paydays are hard to come by these days, at least payoffs for winning 
races are hard to come by. 
</P>
<P>
"Mac has to look all over the place trying to find races that'll pay 100, 200 
or 300 bucks," said Jon Haberkern, a running partner who was suddenly sounding 
like the agent I expected McCormack to have. "The sponsors take care of the 
milers and the marathoners, but nothing in between." 
</P>
<P>
That's where McCormack lives and runs, in between the traditional glamour of 
the mile and the growing clamor for the marathon. He specializes in the 10K 
(6.2 miles) up to the half-marathon (13.1 miles). The big money does not rain 
on his parades. 
</P>
<P>
He knows he does not have the speed for the mile, and the marathon presents 
problems in terms of preparation and after-effects. He would have to work less 
and run more and sacrifice the $100 to $300 races that help put bread and 
margarine on the table. That is risky business, because it involves a six-month 
investment that can go crashing into that proverbial wall at the 20-mile mark. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a history of blowing up after 18 to 20 miles," McCormack said. "I 
know I've got a good marathon in me, but I don't know if I can bring it out." 
</P>
<P>
And so he keeps on going, running's version of a guy who does what he does with 
the very best at a time when the big bucks are being spent on something (or 
someone) else. 
</P>
<P>
Why keep running? 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like being addicted to drugs," he said. "I can't stop. I do it 
regardless of the money. If I was in this for the money, I'd be in it for the 
wrong reasons." 
</P>
<P>
But it seems that 10 fast miles on the sand from a guy doing all that work and 
running all that fast should be worth at least a single. Right professor?

MCMULLEN, WRIGHT STILL WAITING; 
</P>
<P>
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR THEM IN TWO ROUNDS OF NBA DRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CURT HOLBREICH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The announcements that Mitch McMullen and Howard Wright waited 3 1/2 hours to 
hear were never made Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The two rounds of the National Basketball Assn. draft came and went without 
either player being picked. 
</P>
<P>
That left McMullen, a center from San Diego State, and Wright, a forward from 
Stanford and Patrick Henry High School, as free agents, eligible to sign with 
any of the 27 NBA teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched the whole draft," McMullen said. "But I kind of prepared myself that 
if I wasn't taken by a certain point, it was better that I wasn't. That way, as 
a free agent, I can find my own team." 
</P>
<P>
Already, McMullen said, at least one team has expressed an interest. He said he 
received a call from the president and general manager of the Houston Rockets, 
Ray Patterson, as soon as the draft was over. The Rockets did not have a 
selection, having traded away their two picks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
In years past, both McMullen and Wright might have been selected. But the draft 
was limited to two rounds for the first time as part of the collective 
bargaining agreement between the owners and the NBA Players Assn. The draft was 
three rounds last year and seven in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
While becoming a free agent might give McMullen more options, he nevertheless 
was disappointed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been much nicer (to have been picked)," McMullen said. "You get 
the immediate gratification. But I have had to prove myself at each step, so I 
might as well go the hard route. I've worked hard to get where I am, and I will 
continue to work hard." 
</P>
<P>
McMullen, 6-feet-10 and 250 pounds, was one of the few centers available. He 
was seeking to become the first SDSU basketball player drafted since 1986, when 
guard Anthony Watson was selected in the fourth round by Denver and forward 
Steffond Johnson was picked in the fifth round by the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen played at Point Loma Nazarene and the College of the Canyons in 
Valencia before transferring to SDSU. He averaged 13.0 points and 6.1 rebounds 
as a junior and led the Aztecs in scoring (14.6 points per game) and rebounding 
(7.9 per game) as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
McMullen might have had his best game when he scored 29 points and had 12 
rebounds in a 103-92 loss to North Carolina. But it was about that time that 
McMullen bruised his Achilles' tendon. He struggled for the rest of the season 
to regain his shooting touch and conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
"I am just going to stay positive," McMullen said. "I'm going to keep working 
hard because I strongly believe the NBA is in my future. It is a goal I want to 
continue to pursue." 
</P>
<P>
Wright teamed with guard Todd Lichti, who was taken by Denver with the 15th 
pick of the draft, to lead Stanford to one of its most successful seasons. 
Wright, 6-8 and 235 pounds, averaged 14.5 points and 6.9 rebounds. He is the 
son of former Charger lineman Ernie Wright.

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: VISTA'S MICHALS MEDALIST IN AMATEUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerry Michals of Vista was declared the medalist of the 78th California Golf 
Assn. amateur championship when Gary Vanier of Pleasant Hill failed to show for 
a playoff after the two had tied at 141 after 36 holes. 
</P>
<P>
Michals, who represents San Luis Rey Downs Golf Course, and four other San 
Diego-area golfers advanced to the 32-player match play portion of the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego group includes Phil Mickelson, the NCAA Division I champion, and 
Pat Duncan, the three-time San Diego City Amateur champion. 
</P>
<P>
Mickelson rallied with a 67 at the Monterey Peninsula Country Club Tuesday 
after shooting a 78 in the opening round Monday. Mickelson finished with a 145, 
and Duncan was at 146. 
</P>
<P>
Also advancing to match play, which begins today at Pebble Beach, were Keith 
Sbarbaro and Jack Spradlin Jr., both at 147. 
</P>
<P>
Sheri Vincent of San Diego is tied with Tricia Konz of Chandler, Ariz., with a 
two-over 74 after the first round of the Aspen Junior Golf Classic. 
</P>
<P>
TRACK AND FIELD 
</P>
<P>
Jim Cerveny, the San Diego State track and field coach, said that $29,100 has 
been raised toward the $150,000 that will be needed to sustain the Aztec track 
program next season. The deadline for raising the money is Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The men's and women's track program was suspended indefinitely recently by 
Athletic Director Fred Miller because of a growing deficit in the athletic 
department. 
</P>
<P>
SAILING 
</P>
<P>
Major Tom of Ventura leads two boats from the San Diego Yacht Club in the San 
Diego-to-Honolulu Double Handed Transpac race. Major Tom, sailed by Eric Bohman 
and Kevin Miller, leads Adriana and Stinger. 
</P>
<P>
BOWLING 
</P>
<P>
Jess Stayrook of San Diego, who has never won a PBA title, advanced to today's 
stepladder final by leading after six rounds of the Seattle Open.

'CIRCUIT RIDERS': GIVING AWAY RESEARCH MONEY IS AN ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DEMBART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Circuit Riders: Rockefeller Money and the Rise of Modern Science by Gerald 
Jonas (W. W. Norton &amp; Co.; $22.95; 432 pages) 
</P>
<P>
Research is inherently haphazard and unpredictable. No one knows for sure how 
to guarantee discoveries -- much less important discoveries -- in science. 
</P>
<P>
It's not just a matter of getting smart people, giving them research tools and 
support and letting them pursue their interests. Sometimes that works and 
sometimes it doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
Nor should their efforts be highly structured and controlled. That, too, is 
unlikely to bring success -- however one measures success. Some combination of 
structure and freedom is required. 
</P>
<P>
Good intentions and selflessness do not guarantee achievement. Louis Pasteur, 
who was only trying to help the French wine industry solve a problem, did more 
to benefit humanity than all of the Florence Nightingales put together. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Various Approaches Tried 
</P>
<P>
During the last few centuries, a variety of approaches have been tried. In the 
18th Century, the British government offered a prize of 20,000 pounds for the 
development of a clock that could keep time at sea, making possible navigation 
by the stars -- a prize that was won by John Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
The prize approach is still in limited use for specific goals. For example, in 
recent years, prizes spurred the development of human-powered airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
The most important prize in science is open-ended. Nobel Prizes are awarded 
after the fact, not for previously identified achievements but for work that is 
recognized as important. There is no doubt that the Nobel Prize is a carrot 
that drives many scientists and much science. 
</P>
<P>
Since World War II, government support for research has been an indispensable 
element in maintaining the scientific enterprise. But it was not always so. 
Earlier in this century, private philanthropy accounted for the bulk of that 
support, none more important than the hundreds of millions of dollars given to 
scientists by the Rockefeller Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Easy Task 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Jonas tells the history of that support with considerable clarity and 
insight in "The Circuit Riders: Rockefeller Money and the Rise of Modern 
Science." He demonstrates that giving away money is no easy task, and he also 
demonstrates that John D. Rockefeller hired exceptionally talented people to 
decide how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Still, they were faced with the problem that today confronts all benefactors of 
science, including the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes 
of Health: namely, how to give away money effectively. 
</P>
<P>
Having decided that the goal is to benefit humanity by increasing knowledge in 
science and medicine, how can that be achieved? How does one identify worthy 
projects, and how does one identify the right people to undertake them? 
Ideally, this should be done objectively, and the current process of peer 
review is intended to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
But research into the peer-review process has shown that scientists are as 
human as anyone else and that objectivity is an unachievable goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockefeller Foundation, and particular its longtime director, Warren 
Weaver, made decisions on a much more personal basis, but with no less success. 
In fact, Jonas argues that the foundation's enlightened philanthropy has done a 
better job of supporting science than the government or corporation-sponsored 
research. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation played important roles in the discovery of penicillin, as well 
as in the agricultural revolutions that have increased crop yields around the 
world. Those achievements alone help make Jonas' case. 
</P>
<P>
There have also been clinkers -- how could there not be? -- and Jonas describes 
them too. But, overall, he is a stanch defender of the foundation against 
various critics, and his argument is persuasive. 
</P>
<P>
It is not clear, however, how this success story can be duplicated. The lesson 
seems to be that if you get very good people to hand out the money, much can be 
achieved. But that just pushes the inquiry one stage back. Rather than asking 
how to find brilliant scientists, the question becomes how to find brilliant 
administrators to hand out the money. 
</P>
<P>
As in most other areas of human endeavor, if you put the right people in the 
right jobs, you have a chance. But doing that remains an art, not a science.

RAITT IN THE ROLE OF HER LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Finally, Bonnie Raitt has the script she wants to play -- and this 
blues-singing daughter of a well-known stage actor played it to the hilt at the 
Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Raitt's new script is triumphant: Cast off as a commercial has-been, a 
hard-working, resilient singer surges back with a hit album that underlines, 
rather than compromises, her talent. Playing for a rapturous audience Monday 
night in one of the small clubs where she kept the faith during lean years, 
Raitt basked openly in her success. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, it feels like prom night," she said after waves of applause greeted the 
title song from her comeback album "Nick of Time." But this evening in a steamy 
club played more like an episode of "This Is Your Life," with Raitt as her own 
emcee. 
</P>
<P>
Raitt, 39, paused often during the nearly two-hour set to look back over the 
past and savor the present from a promontory that wasn't easily reached. 
</P>
<P>
She made several oblique references to the fact that lately she has been 
appearing on far bigger stages (such as the Wiltern Theatre, where she and her 
band play Friday night). She was less oblique in a couple of barbed comments 
about her old record label, Warner Bros., which twice cut Raitt loose during 
the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, Raitt relished moments such as the introduction to "Three Time Loser," 
where she was able to speak with the swagger of a winner: "I'm not taking (any 
guff) from anybody," she vowed. "It's great to be able to stand up here and say 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Raitt was full of herself, but that's appropriate. Fullness has been her 
style -- both in the brimming sass of her guise as a blueswoman who revels in 
raunchiness, and in the fullness of emotion that Raitt can bring to bear on 
songs that call for gentle warmth or quiet expressions of pain. On this night, 
especially in those more circumspect moments, she was full to overflowing. 
</P>
<P>
Raitt's freewheeling side came out best in playfully jumping versions of "Woman 
Be Wise" and "Give It Up," a couple of old favorites that she and her sharp 
quintet did up in old-time New Orleans style, complete with two tootling horns. 
</P>
<P>
After starting the show with amiable rockers that didn't quite catch fire, 
Raitt turned to songs from "Nick of Time" that brought the show into focus: 
"Too Soon to Tell" with an aching but firm lament about being spurned in love, 
and "Cry on My Shoulder" with a comforting message of sympathy in which Raitt's 
earthy singing balanced a polished pop arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Raitt struck a moving grace note by pausing near the end of her celebratory set 
to dedicate a lovely elegy, "River of Tears," to the memory of musicians Lowell 
George, Paul Butterfield, Jesse Ed Davis and Carl Radle -- "the ones I had to 
say goodby to." 
</P>
<P>
Her singing and playing carried the lament as far as she could take it. Then, 
in a gesture that was as eloquent as the music, Raitt stopped playing, cradled 
the guitar against her body, and embraced herself against the sadness of loss. 
</P>
<P>
Before closing with one last rocker, Raitt sang yet another telling, quiet 
song, John Prine's "Angel From Montgomery." The song is about a woman so 
isolated and bereft of prospects for warmth that she considers giving up on 
life. But something in Raitt's rendition -- a spark of determination, or 
perhaps even anger -- suggested reserves of toughness that would enable her to 
get by. 
</P>
<P>
One of these days, Richard Thompson, who opened with a 55-minute solo set, also 
will get a gold record and a triumphant evening to go with it. When that day 
comes, Thompson probably will show the same coolly sardonic humor he did at the 
Coach House, along with the same incomparable guitar style. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson starts with the deft, fluid attack and rhythmic drive that most 
guitarists hold as their ultimate goal -- then proceeds to insert the 
distinctive bends, groans, shivers and chromatic strokes that make his playing 
truly special.

WINOGRAND'S CAMERA PROWLS THE STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man I know says he recently made a major change in his life -- he has stopped 
thinking of women as goddesses. Thrice-married photographer Garry Winogrand, on 
the other hand, never gave up his worshipful vision of the female sex. 
</P>
<P>
Watching visions of pulchritude walk down New York City streets in the '60s -- 
swathed in taut fabrics, caught up in private worlds, appraised by male 
passers-by -- he fell in love over and over. But the photographs he took of 
these women -- included in a vast and glorious retrospective of his work, at 
the Museum of Contemporary Art through Aug. 20 -- were more than valentines. 
They were part of a vision that embraced the complexity and randomness of urban 
life and refused to pare it down to easy-to-grasp essentials. 
</P>
<P>
Discovering photography at age 20 after a stint in the Army and a half-hearted 
attempt to study painting at Columbia University, Winogrand took to it with a 
raw, unschooled vengeance. Three years later, in 1951, he became a photo agency 
free-lancer. 
</P>
<P>
The photographs from that early period are notable for their energy and 
attention to stray detail. A man somersaults on a parade float; a woman laughs 
ferociously while dancing at the nightclub, El Morocco; a worried-looking child 
in a wading pool is grasped by a woman whose body is lopped off at the hip. 
</P>
<P>
It was during the early '60s that Winogrand hit on a way of getting close to 
strangers in public places. Standing at a distance that normally would permit 
only a head shot, he used a wide-angle lens to survey the entire body. Doing 
this meant moving the camera slightly downward. To compensate for the resulting 
skewed view of the surrounding architecture, Winogrand tilted the frame. The 
emphatic interior angles he created were charged with the energy of the street. 
</P>
<P>
But he didn't think of this practice as a "technique." Uninterested in rules 
and standards, he worked the way he did because he was always experimenting 
with ways of getting at the casual -- even seemingly meaningless -- 
conjunctions of events in places people congregate. As time went on, his notion 
of what made a meaty photograph became ever more diffuse and distant from 
traditional notions of composition. 
</P>
<P>
He could catch a symbolic chance moment, like a cab-hailing pregnant woman 
whose belly exactly synchronizes with the position of her small son, so the 
unborn child seems to have legs and arms of its own. But he could also 
demonstrate that a photographer needn't draw a conclusion about what he sees in 
order to create a memorable picture. 
</P>
<P>
"American Legion Convention, Dallas, Texas" is a disorganized slice-of-life on 
a street corner. One elderly veteran has his arms crossed over his chest and 
looks up at the sky. Another stands looking out into space, his hands in his 
pockets. Other people wait to cross the street. A man slouches against the 
building. And an apparently legless man lies on the pavement, his forearms 
extended like paws. 
</P>
<P>
The photograph was taken in 1964, but it comes across as neither a patriotic 
nor an anti-Vietnam War statement. (Winogrand abandoned his interest in 
politics during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis because, he said, of the feeling 
it gave him of his own powerlessness.) The power of the image comes from the 
vacuum that has formed around the legless man. But you can read into it 
whatever you wish, or nothing at all. 
</P>
<P>
A series of photographs Winogrand took at zoos puts the animals and the 
visitors on an equal footing -- as observers, as oddities. A couple in checked 
shirts observes a pair of elephants; next to the couple two people stand 
shrouded by a big cardboard box. A family peers through the bars separating 
them from a sea otter; at the bottom of the picture frame, the otter looks as 
though it is seeking relief from such concerted scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
Airports -- where people are flung together in big cold spaces by virtue of 
wanting to get to the same destination -- were prime Winogrand territory. So 
were the oddball posturings at '60s parties. And so were media events, scanned 
for the odd detail, like the pathetic pair of potted plants and cluster of 
reporters' cassette recorders surrounding Secretary of Defense Elliot 
Richardson at a 1973 press conference. 
</P>
<P>
By the '70s, Winogrand had given up journalism to do his own work. New York 
remained his main turf, but he ventured to other places -- Los Angeles, the Ft. 
Worth Fat Stock Show -- in search of texture and incident. 
</P>
<P>
The final group of prints dates from Winogrand's last years (he died in 1984), 
when illness, the shambles of his personal life, and a seeming inability to 
edit or even contemplate what he was shooting had taken the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
He left more than 2,500 rolls of exposed film, plus an additional 6,500 rolls 
that were developed but not arranged on proof sheets. Preliminary contact 
sheets, made from 3,000 more rolls, had hardly been edited. From this numbing 
evidence of activity, 25 prints have been made posthumously. There is at once a 
harshness and a deep mystery about them. In one image, shot in Los Angeles 
about 1980, a young priest stands by a mailbox with a hunted expression on his 
face as he holds a tiny object between his long, bony fingers. 
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the exhibit is accompanied 
by a separate group of Winogrand's prints from MOCA's own collection. The big, 
juicy catalogue contains an exquisite essay by curator John Szarkowski. Few are 
the artists whose work has been analyzed with the brilliance and compassion he 
summons to the page.

ABERCROMBIE'S GIVES 'COCTEAU' POETIC JUSTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ian Abercrombie did not try to look like Jean Cocteau in his one-man 
impersonation of the French poet, artist, playwright and film maker last 
weekend. He merely was. When the lights went up at the Gallery Theatre in 
Barnsdall Park on "Jean Cocteau -- Mirror Image," they revealed Abercrombie in 
a pose characteristic of the flamboyant man he was portraying: a long scarf 
stylishly draped over his shoulders and down the back, his hands with palms 
turned upward. 
</P>
<P>
It was enough. 
</P>
<P>
Cocteau (the centenary of whose birth is being celebrated in a variety of 
Southland events this year) believed in making an impression, in being his own 
poem. Anything more suggestive than that slightly dandified pose would have 
been too much. For another thing, Abercrombie and Cocteau look nothing alike. 
The latter was slender with a large head made even larger by an unruly shock of 
frizzy hair, a long, triangular face, hollow cheeks and penetrating eyes. 
Abercrombie is compact and rounder -- a testament to what an actor can do to 
convey an essence without attempting a reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the script of "Mirror Image" (written by Crispin Thomas) concentrated 
on doing the same thing: Giving us an essence rather than a duplication. 
Abercrombie, his straight and docile hair only lightly ruffled, simply walked 
around and talked. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke about aspects of Cocteau's life and art, touching largely on his 
achievement and his ego ("If they had known that I was going to become Jean 
Cocteau they might have been more understanding. . . . Already my life was a 
masterpiece"). Cocteau's homosexuality was acknowledged (". . . the spectacle 
of soldiers bathing . . ." or watching sailors in Toulon), as were his lovers 
(especially the young novelist Raymond Radiguet), his addictions (opium and 
language -- "I am jealous of the words of other writers, except Flaubert") and 
his inspirations (notably Proust, Satie, Stravinsky and Picasso). 
</P>
<P>
While there is nothing especially new in such revelations, the Thomas script 
imparted it all in short, elegant bursts quite worthy of the eclectic 
Frenchman, along with some psychological factors that completed the portrait 
with less widely known biographical detail (his father, "an amateur painter," 
shot himself in the head with a pistol and "Auguste, my mother's valet, became 
the head of the household. . . ."). 
</P>
<P>
Thomas/Abercrombie also allowed for small personal manifestos, dropped 
casually, here and there, between other events: the battle (as Cocteau saw it) 
between "sex and creativity"; art as "the love-making of self and self" -- and 
a credo or two. "I love mankind," he announced. "I love love; I hate hate. . . 
. If I disapprove of a work, I try to find something in it that will make me 
change my mind." (Among his many accomplishments -- some people say too many -- 
Cocteau clearly should also have become a critic.) 
</P>
<P>
This canny, elliptical style, that gives you enough without crowding the 
canvas, was also picked up by the director, Robert Robinson, who, on a 
carefully uncluttered stage dominated by an opium pipe, allowed Abercrombie to 
physically do less, trusting in our ability to fill in the blanks, which at 
once made it possible for us to hear more. 
</P>
<P>
After the gyrations of last week's program of performing artists all working 
too hard at giving us something "in the spirit of" Jean Cocteau, the clarity, 
restraint, simplicity and pleasure of the man himself -- or a persuasive 
facsimile -- were a tremendous relief.

Elton John is set to reprise the role of the Pinball Wizard, which he played in 
the 1975 film version of "Tommy," when the Who performs its rock opera at the 
Universal Amphitheatre on Aug. 24. The show (which will be televised as a 
pay-per-view event) also is expected to feature Robert Plant as the Hawker, 
Phil Collins as Uncle Ernie and Billy Idol as the abusive Cousin Kevin. The Who 
was scheduled to play "Tommy" on Tuesday at New York's Radio City Music Hall 
without the all-star cast. Proceeds from both productions are being donated to 
various charities and to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. ALEENE MacMINN

"Miami Vice" star Don Johnson and actress Melanie Griffith, whose marriage 13 
years ago lasted less than a year, were remarried Monday evening to the strains 
of a string quartet and the roar of news helicopters. Johnson, 39, and 
Griffith, 31, exchanged vows about 6:30 p.m. in the woods near Johnson's rustic 
ranch 10 miles northwest of Aspen, Colo. Roads leading to the marriage site 
were closed, but two helicopters carrying paparazzi and reporters from tabloid 
press hovered over the scene as about 30 guests witnessed the brief, 
nondenominational ceremony.ALEENE MacMINN

Journalist Bill Moyers will receive $5 million in funding for public television 
productions during the next three years through a grant from the John D. and 
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The funds will be divided evenly between 
public television stations WTTW (Chicago) and WNET (New York), which serve as 
co-presenters for Moyers' programs. Of the $5-million MacArthur grant, $3.75 
million is a challenge grant in support of the weekly production of Moyers' "A 
World of Ideas," and $1.25 million will create a discretionary fund on which 
Moyers can draw to produce new documentaries or specials. ALEENE MacMINN

CASTING, MIXTURE OF MOODS SET 'A FEW DAYS WITH ME' ABLAZE 
</P>

Mad passion -- the grand amour that unhinges you, makes you throw away your 
life -- is a frequent movie subject. But it's rarely handled with the intense 
observation or generous good humor writer-director Claude Sautet brings to "A 
Few Days With Me" (Music Hall). 
</P>
<P>
Focusing on the cross-class liaison of an alienated young man, heir to a French 
supermarket chain, and the maid of one of his family's managers, this movie has 
an almost irresistible narrative drive. Sautet, one of the great artisans of 
the naturalistic French screenplay, is dealing with life and death, love that 
destroys, but he mixes his moods expertly. He keeps "A Few Days With Me" 
incongruously light, deft, humorous. 
</P>
<P>
He portrays pathology by giving it an unflinching gaze, by filling the story 
with amusingly eccentric characters and unexpected twists. It's a seeming 
romantic tragedy or melodrama told in an engaging comic style. The deceptive, 
often lackadaisical-seeming rhythm keeps you constantly off balance, until the 
trap is sprung. 
</P>
<P>
Sautet's lovers are played by Daniel Auteuil, the guilt-ridden son of "Jean de 
Florette" and Sandrine Bonnaire, the almost scarily independent hoyden of "A 
Nos Amours" and "Vagabonde." It's a brilliant piece of double casting. Auteuil, 
without his grotesque "Florette" prosthesis and makeup, has the yearning eyes 
and delicate, wary features of an obsessive swain. When we first meet his 
Martial, recovering from depression in an asylum, he seems vaguely dislocated, 
insulated by his family's wealth from life's shocks, oddly unaffected by 
everything, including his wife's infidelity. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnaire, on the other hand, has exactly the stuff a man like this -- dreamy, 
sarcastic, sensitive, bored -- might get obsessed with. As Francine, whom 
Martial meets in Limoges while checking the books of her genial employer, 
Fonfrin (Jean-Pierre Marielle), she projects something earthy and unfettered, 
seductive in a seemingly uncalculated way. (Bonnaire is the actress audiences 
wish Madonna could be.) A practical femme fatale, Francine meets Martial's mad 
plunges and rich boy's self-indulgence with a working girl's shrewd 
self-interest. And, as he journeys through degradation and disgrace to possess 
her, she watches not bitchily or malignly, but curiously, almost bemusedly. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1974 "Vincent, Francois, Paul and the Others," Sautet proved himself a 
poet of friendship. He excels at the portrayal of communities and the three 
groups he draws here -- the glassy artificiality of the Pasquier family, the 
provincial pretensions of the Limoges bourgeois who run the Pasquier stores and 
the raw roughhouse swagger and cunning of Francine's friends -- make for a 
marvelous collision. It also inspires a marvelous ensemble. Marielle, as the 
amiably corrupt Fonfrin and the legendary beauty Danielle Darrieux, as 
Martial's mother, give perfect performances; the rest of the cast, notably 
Dominique Lavanant as the neurotic Mme. Fonfrin and Gerard Ismael as the 
sinister Rocky, are nearly as good. 
</P>
<P>
Sautet indulges all his actors, helps them to their best form. But he doesn't 
indulge his lovers. He shows exactly what happens when their worlds clash, 
never losing his innate sympathy or his comic, urbane perspective. That's why 
the film sustains so well the classic narrative virtues of surprise and 
inevitability, and why, in the end, Sautet, Auteuil and Bonnaire can give us 
such a devastating last few shots. And it's why "A Few Days With Me" (MPAA 
rated PG-13, despite partial nudity) can reveal so convincingly the tigerish 
passions that smolder beneath a surface that's deceptively calm, charmingly 
funny, insidiously smooth.

MAKING MOST OF PART-TIME 'PHANTOM' ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
In the best of all possible views, "The Phantom of the Opera" is a fairy tale, 
pure and simple. 
</P>
<P>
A concomitant to enjoying this blockbuster is a willing acceptance of its 
improbable premise (the existence of a freak of nature residing in the bowels 
of the French opera), its romantic aspects (the love of this freak for one of 
the young dancers in the chorus), and its Svengaliesque propositions (his 
psychological "possession" of the dancer/singer, Christine Daae, whom he grooms 
and trains to become a star by exerting an infatuating power over her). 
</P>
<P>
Part and parcel of this enjoyment, then, is dependent on the chemistry 
generated between the Phantom and Christine and, to an inordinately large 
degree, on the right looks for each. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Crawford, who has become all but synonymous with the title role, has 
this down pat. He's tall, slender, moves with a stealthy grace, uses his 
long-fingered hands with the artful delicacy of a dancer, is made more 
mysterious by the mask and dapper felt hat that partially cover his face -- and 
is possessed (literally) of an echo chamber of a voice that fairly drips with 
charisma and sex. 
</P>
<P>
How is a Christine to resist? 
</P>
<P>
She is not. But to help us believe that she's helplessly drawn to this 
sorcerer, this enigmatic king of the netherworld, we also need to see in her a 
pliant, fragile, ultimately breakable creature powerless to fight the Phantom's 
magnetic pull. 
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Mary D'Arcy, who plays Christine at all Tuesday and Wednesday 
night performances of "The Phantom" (as the alternate to featured performer, 
Dale Kristien), is close to perfect casting. 
</P>
<P>
She has the grace, the crystalline voice, the temperamental transports and the 
porcelain-like quality demanded by the role. She even manages to seem haunted 
and insomniac (are those dark circles under her eyes?), bedeviled as it were by 
this unrelenting force that is claiming her. Yet she does not relinquish the 
mounting assurance acquired by the character as the show moves toward its 
climactic liberation from the Phantom's grip. 
</P>
<P>
D'Arcy's Christine, in fact, enhances our belief in the Phantom's final 
heartbreak by believing in it herself. This is a Christine who is not just 
terrified and irresistibly swallowed up by him, like a limp vegetable (a clear 
danger in this role), but a Christine who ultimately has the capacity to become 
stronger than he is and therefore compassionate and giving. 
</P>
<P>
Her brief voluntary return into the Phantom's lair at the end (as improbable as 
it might seem in any sort of realistic context) springs -- appropriately -- 
from an impulse of pity tinged with palpable concern, if not affection. There 
is, beyond the fear and loathing, the stirring of a genuine emotion. It is the 
understanding of the pain the man is in. This more than anything else is what 
makes "The Phantom" work. 
</P>
<P>
Without taking anything away from the other days of the week, it works like 
gangbusters on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

JAZZ NOTES : PAUL MAZZIO AWARDED $3,000 FELLOWSHIP; BERRY GIG TO BENEFIT 
CHILDRENS HOSPITAL 
</P>

Trumpeter/fluegelhornist Paul Mazzio of North Hollywood has been awarded a 1989 
Jazz Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts -- a $3,000 grant to 
support the costs of making a demo recording. 
</P>
<P>
The trumpeter was one of 18 applicants from the arts endowment's Western 
Region, which includes California as well some of the Northwestern and 
Southwestern states, and the only one from California to win a fellowship. In 
all, 74 jazz musicians nationwide received fellowships, which totaled $450,000 
and are given only to individuals. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to California, in the greater New York City region there were 42 
musicians (out of 127 applicants) who received grants. One of these was pianist 
Keith Saunders, former San Fernando Valley resident who currently lives in 
Manhattan. Asked about this disparity, the arts endowment's acting director 
Antoinette Handy said that "an insufficient number (of musicians) seem to be 
applying" from the Western Region. "New York has more recipients since there's 
a larger pool of applicants to draw from." 
</P>
<P>
The applicants compete by tape in a blind judging, Handy noted. 
</P>
<P>
This year's panel of judges included pianists Valerie Capers, Anthony Davis, 
Roberta Davis and Judy Carmichal, reedmen Richie Cole and Paul Jeffery and 
bassist Bill Lee. "In designing the panel, we're very careful about region, 
gender, race and ethnicity," Handy said. "And," she emphasized, "We're most 
careful about expertise." 
</P>
<P>

Washington, D.C. 20506, or call (202) 682-5522.

AIDING CHILDRENS HOSPITAL: When Bill Berry leads his Ellington All-Stars in one 
of four "Concerts for a Sunday Afternoon" this Sunday at the Joslyn Community 
Center in Manhattan Beach -- all of which benefit Childrens Hospital of Los 
Angeles -- he'll be talking, as well as playing, his way through the show. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to do an intimate concert series (the Joslyn seats 350 people) in 
which the audience got to hear some varied music (coming shows feature music 
from India and the Los Angeles Cello Quartet) and also heard the performers 
explain what they're doing or tell anecdotes," said musician Brad Dechter, one 
of the series' producers. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been at concerts at the Music Center where performers talked to the 
audience and these explanations and demonstrations really enhanced the 
performance, making it much more enjoyable," said Dechter, a saxophonist and 
composer who co-wrote and orchestrated the recent Nick Castle film, "Taps" and 
has scored episodes of "Moonlighting." 
</P>
<P>
Dechter -- who is producing the series along with his wife, Maureen Smith 
Dechter and Robin Smith -- chose Childrens Hospital as the beneficiary of the 
concerts for personal reasons. "The staff there diagnosed a major disease in 
our son, Graham, and eventually cured him," he said. "My wife and I are forever 
grateful and were looking for a way to give something back to the hospital," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the Berry concert, which begins at 3 p.m., are $20, or two for $30. 
Information: (213) 376-6170. 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 Joe Sample's "Spellbound" (Warner Bros.) sits atop the contemporary 
jazz charts for good reason. The pianist's style is a listenable mix of 
earthiness and sweetness and here he provides a balanced program, from the 
dancing title track to the bluesy "All God's Children." Vocals from Al Jarreau, 
Michael Franks and Take 6 spice things up; the latter group shines on "U Turn," 
which, while philosophical in nature, happily eschews the group's usual gospel 
slant. 
</P>
<P>
Records are rated from one to five stars. ***** means a swinging must-have for 
the jazz lover, * means save your pennies, Benny.

A general strike was staged in New Delhi to protest the killing of 24 Hindus by 
Sikh separatists Sunday in Punjab state. Most shops in the Indian capital were 
closed by the one-day strike called by the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata 
Party, but banks and government offices operated normally. A party spokesman 
said the strike was intended to display "the deep resentment of the people" and 
promised to press for "determined action in Punjab on terrorism."

A Belgian air force colonel accused of giving top secret Belgian and North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization documents to the Soviet Union was convicted of 
treason and sentenced to 20 years at hard labor. Col. Guy Binet, 54, received 
$105,000 for the information he passed to Moscow, according to testimony at the 
trial in Brussels. Belgian Defense Minister Guy Coeme said Binet began spying 
for the Soviet Union in 1986. He said the motive was profit, rather than 
ideological reasons.

A Santa Cruz businessman wants to build a center in Alameda that uses 
California red worms to recycle organic waste. The worms eat their own weight 
in waste each day and "show a strong preference for paper mill and sewage 
sludge," David Eagle of Earthworm Technology said in a letter to the Alameda 
City Council. According to Eagle, one ton of worms can multiply into 1,000 tons 
in a single year.

China has ordered 11 Americans affiliated with a U.S. evangelical group to 
leave the country for distributing religious materials, officials in Beijing 
said. They said the missionaries, belonging to the Latter Reign Ministry of 
Litchfield, Ill., had their passports seized Saturday by agents of the Public 
Security Bureau in the southwestern city of Kunming. In Washington, State 
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that religious materials were 
seized and that 11 in the group were ordered to leave the country by Friday. 
Tutwiler said a 12th member was permitted to stay.

Compelled by Congress to craft a plan to try to keep guns out of the hands of 
felons, a Justice Department task force published an options study in the 
Federal Register that outlines dozens of variations on two major approaches, 
the Washington Post reported. One would target potential gun owners by 
requiring pre-sale certification that they have no criminal record. The other 
would target gun dealers, requiring them to check with police agencies that 
would be equipped to search criminal records quickly. One proposal calls for 
all Americans to be issued a "smart card," an identification card that would be 
encoded with electronically imprinted identification information, including 
fingerprints.

Remnants of Tropical Storm Allison moved into eastern Texas and western 
Louisiana, still dumping heavy rain and triggering thunderstorms after hitting 
the Houston area with more than 10 inches of rain. Downpours flooded homes and 
streets, forcing at least 800 people into Red Cross shelters. At least two 
fatalities were blamed on the storm, which was downgraded to a tropical 
depression in the morning. Harris County Sheriff's Department divers pulled a 
man's body from rain-swollen Spring Creek. On Monday, a traffic death in the 
Beaumont area was attributed to the storm. In southwestern Louisiana, police 
reported that a tornado at Hackberry damaged roofs and destroyed a mobile home.

Leftist guerrillas claimed responsibility for the assassination of El 
Salvador's national fire department chief. The Farabundo Marti National 
Liberation Front said on rebel radio that a commando unit ambushed Col. Roberto 
Armando Rivera, 45. It said Rivera's death was justified because "he was a 
military officer with a clear record of criminal acts and repression." They 
said he gave courses in psychological warfare and interrogation techniques and 
was linked to right-wing death squads that terrorized the country in the early 
1980s.

A Palestinian prisoner in a Negev desert jail for Arab security prisoners 
killed two inmates, the army said, and police suggested that the victims may 
have been suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities. Israel Radio 
said a prisoner confessed to the slayings, which raise to four the number of 
inmates killed by fellow prisoners in the last two weeks. Meanwhile, aides to 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said he will meet with Arab leaders from the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip next month to discuss his election plan. In the occupied 
lands, troops wounded at least 29 Palestinians, including four 11-year-olds, 
when they opened fire on stone throwers.

BAN ON AIRLINES' USE OF EL TORO BASE DUE VOTE

<P>
The House Armed Services Committee is expected to approve a measure today that 
would prohibit commercial aviation service at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) quietly introduced the measure last 
week and said that its enactment would fulfill his longstanding campaign 
promise to keep El Toro from being used to reduce overcrowding at John Wayne 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
"The people of the district have made it abundantly clear they do not want 
joint (commercial-military) use at El Toro," Cox said. "Time after time, in 
public forums during the (1988) election campaign . . . I've said no joint use 
at El Toro. That's what (the voters) wanted to hear, and that's what we're 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
Cox's proposal will probably clear the House of Representatives if the Armed 
Services Committee, as expected, attaches it as an amendment to the annual 
defense authorization bill, congressional sources said. Whether it will become 
law probably will depend on its acceptance by the House-Senate conference 
committee, whose members will be appointed to reconcile differences between the 
House and Senate versions of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
In seeking the action, Cox is asking Congress to help resolve a key element in 
the 20-year-old local battle over expansion of John Wayne Airport and efforts 
to find an alternative site for commercial aviation. El Toro base, which some 
have advocated as an alternative to John Wayne Airport, is located in Cox's 
central Orange County congressional district. 
</P>
<P>
Cox conceded in an interview that this step may not be popular with everyone. 
It is "not an issue without controversy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cox's preemptive strike against joint use of El Toro, accomplished with the aid 
of Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), a member of the Armed Services 
Committee, drew heated reaction from Newport Beach officials and members of a 
private group of civic leaders that is evaluating sites for a new county 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that any type of legislation that would short-circuit the 
grass-roots effort is very, very counterproductive," Newport Beach City Manager 
Robert L. Wynn said. 
</P>
<P>
"It just doesn't seem to me to be the proper thing to do. I'm disappointed that 
he (Cox) did that," said Clarence J. Turner, a Newport Beach city councilman 
who is vice president of the Airport Site Coalition. "I'd like to see all of 
these sites evaluated on a fair and equal basis." 
</P>
<P>
The coalition, formed several years ago as part of a court settlement that 
permitted expansion of John Wayne Airport, is due to release its 
recommendations in about six months on sites for new commercial aviation 
facilities in Orange County. El Toro base is among the locations under 
consideration, Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction to Cox's initiative was decidedly different from the leader of an 
opposing group that is fighting plans to bring commercial aviation to El Toro 
base. 
</P>
<P>
"Hallelujah!" exclaimed Sally Anne Sheridan, an Irvine city councilwoman who 
heads the Coalition for a Responsible Airport Solution. "The significance for 
Irvine and all the surrounding cities is that we will not have to be fighting 
the battle of joint use." 
</P>
<P>
The Cox measure initially was introduced as a separate bill on June 20. With 
Dornan's help, the bill was attached as an amendment to the massive 1990 
defense authorization bill by the readiness subcommittee of the Armed Services 
Committee. Aides expect the full committee to approve the bill today without 
significant debate. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of the merits of the issue, just from a political standpoint, it's 
a very impressive feat," Orange County Washington lobbyist James F. McConnell 
said of Cox's maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
Debate over the proposed use of El Toro for commercial flights has been 
building for many years. 
</P>
<P>
The military and city officials from communities such as Irvine that are next 
to the Marine base strongly oppose any commercial use, contending that it would 
interfere with the base's military mission, create terrible traffic problems 
and endanger lives. 
</P>
<P>
Officials from Newport Beach, which borders John Wayne Airport, assert that 
using El Toro for commercial flights would reduce overcrowding and noise at the 
county's only major commercial air passenger facility. 
</P>
<P>
The battle took an unusual twist in December, 1987, when a Michigan congressman 
who had frequently been at loggerheads with former Rep. Robert E. Badham 
(R-Newport Beach), who preceded Cox, persuaded Congress to order the Federal 
Aviation Administration to study joint use of the El Toro base. 
</P>
<P>
In a report released the following May, the FAA concluded that joint use was 
"feasible," but stopped short of adopting a recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw this done to us in the opposite way (in 1987)," Cox said. "So what's 
fair, is fair. . . . I've now spent a year talking to people all over the 40th 
Congressional District, and the areas most affected by this, Irvine and Laguna 
Hills, will never stand for joint use. Therefore, as a political matter, it 
ought to come off the table."

3,000-ACRE BLAZE BATTLED ALONG THE ORTEGA HIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Hundreds of firefighters, hampered by steep terrain and darkness, struggled 
Tuesday night to halt the summer's first major brush fire, a 3,000-acre blaze 
that raced through the Cleveland National Forest east of San Juan Capistrano 
and threatened more than 100 homes. 
</P>
<P>
The fire roared unchecked on both sides of Ortega Highway, the primary link 
between south Orange County and Lake Elsinore in Riverside County. The highway 
was shut down shortly after the fire erupted about 4 p.m. near the Upper San 
Juan campground, about 15 miles east of Interstate 5. What sparked the fire is 
unknown, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
By dusk, nearly 600 firefighters from half a dozen departments were battling 
the blaze as it moved north and east. At least seven remote campgrounds and 
clusters of homes tucked into the isolated canyons and mountain valleys were 
threatened by the advancing flames. 
</P>
<P>
"It's steep and rocky and there's an abundance of fuel," said California 
Department of Forestry spokesman Bill Bruggema, referring to the dense 
chaparral. "There's no expectation of containment. The fire is moving at a 
pretty good clip. . . . No telling how big this might get." 
</P>
<P>
Before darkness fell, firefighters were assisted by chemical and water drops 
from nine airplanes and four helicopters. But the aerial assault failed to slow 
the blaze, which forced officials to evacuate residents in El Cariso Village, 
the Ortega campground, Morrell Canyon and those living along Long Canyon Road. 
The fire also threatened the Convail Nudist Camp and moved within half a mile 
of Los Pinos Rural Job Corps Center, a center for juvenile inmates, but the 
camp was not evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
Any chance of quickly encircling the blaze was foiled when it split into three 
"heads" and fanned out in two directions on both sides of the Orange-Riverside 
county line, Bruggema said. Mild temperatures and light winds seemed to favor 
firefighters, but three years of below-average rainfall have created "tinder 
dry" conditions in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely dry," said Bob Paul, another forestry spokesman, who added 
that the vegetation in the area is 25 to 30 years old, and rainfall last year 
was less than 50% of normal. 
</P>
<P>
"You get those fires in those canyons, and they will create their own wind." 
</P>
<P>
American Red Cross personnel had readied an evacuation center at Lake Elsinore 
High School, but it was never opened because no one showed up in need of 
assistance. Late Tuesday night, no homes had been lost and no one had been 
reported injured. 
</P>
<P>
Within minutes of the bulletins about the blaze, the California Highway Patrol 
closed Ortega Highway, creating a rush-hour nightmare for commuters who travel 
the 34-mile road between Orange County's job centers and a string of bedroom 
communities around Lake Elsinore. A command post was set up at Caspers 
Wilderness Park, and only those who lived in the fire area where allowed beyond 
that point. The highway was officially closed all the way to Grand Avenue in 
Lake Elsinore. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the commuters were forced to turn around and either go south to San 
Diego County or north to Santa Ana Canyon and then east to eventually reach the 
Elsinore area. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people were awfully mad," one CHP dispatcher said. "For some people, 
it probably meant an extra two hours on the road." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Winston, a restaurant manager in San Juan Capistrano who lives in the 
Riverside County community of Corona, was one of the Ortega commuters forced to 
take the long way home. 
</P>
<P>
"Taking Ortega over the mountains saves me anywhere from 30 to 45 minutes on my 
drive," said Winston as he was leaving work for the drive home. "Now, I've got 
to go up the (Interstate) 5 into Orange County. That's a frightening concept." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the CHP said Ortega would be closed until midnight, but by nightfall 
officials said the road would not reopen until this morning at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters on the lines came from Orange and Riverside counties, as well as 
the California Department of Forestry and the U.S. Forest Service. At least 
eight bulldozers were on the scene to clear fire breaks and trails along slopes 
and ridgelines. Another 40 fire engines joined the battle. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the homes in the area threatened by the fire were described as 
"luxurious." Dave Struthers, manager of maintenance and operations for the Lake 
Elsinore Unified School District, said many of those living in what he called 
the "summit area" along the Ortega Highway had moved there seeking privacy. The 
area is roughly 1,800 to 2,500 feet above sea level, with dense growth. 
</P>
<P>
"People moved there because they wanted some land and space," Struthers said. 
</P>

RESIDENTS KEEPING WARY WATCH ON FOREST FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As darkness fell Tuesday evening over the Cleveland National Forest, the glow 
of a fast-burning fire began to emerge from the billowing smoke enveloping much 
of the rugged mountains along the Ortega Highway. 
</P>
<P>
In this backwoods, high-country corner of Orange County hugging the Riverside 
County border, firefighters were struggling to get control of the blaze as 
nearby residents kept a wary eye on the fire's path. 
</P>
<P>
Forest fires are not unusual in the area, but nonetheless residents say they 
know that when the thick brush and trees are very dry, a fire could oust them 
from their homes with little notice. 
</P>
<P>
At a Forest Service fire station on Ortega Highway just outside the western 
border of the national forest, Christine Carrington walked up from her home in 
nearby Sievers Canyon about 8:30 p.m. to check on the progress of the fire, 
which was another 10 miles uphill from there. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned but not alarmed, Carrington said, "We go through this every summer." 
</P>
<P>
Even though the fire was 10 miles away, she had already packed up family 
documents and photo albums, just in case, and was ready to evacuate along with 
two cats and a dog. "I hope someone wakes us during the night if we need to 
leave." 
</P>
<P>
Also at the fire station was Terry Anderson, who said he and his wife had come 
to the area recently from Minnesota and have been living temporarily in a 
trailer park near the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson said he was headed home when he stopped at the fire station to find 
out what was happening. "All of a sudden, wham, the road was blocked," he said. 
"I wasn't ready for this. You would think that this doesn't happen in 
California -- that there are no trees." 
</P>
<P>
Worried about his wife and his $14,000 Harley-Davidson motorcycle, both at 
home, Anderson said he learned that he couldn't get through to his trailer park 
off Ortega Highway and that residents had been evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
He wondered where he will link up with his wife. "I don't know where she's at," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some motorists heading east along the busy Ortega Highway were turned back by 
California Highway Patrol officers. The officers stopped motorists about three 
miles east of Interstate 5, where the highway narrows to two lanes and snakes 
its way slowly up into the mountains before it drops again to Lake Elsinore. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to do," said motorist Charles Worthington, who was planning 
to visit friends in the San Juan Springs area near the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the camping trip is cut short," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Forest Service firefighters at the camp said the fire began along Ortega about 
4 p.m. near a store called the Candy Store, and quickly spread to both sides of 
the highway. 
</P>
<P>
By 8:45 p.m, CHP Officer D. Hertsch said, about 40 homes in the area had been 
evacuated and the fire was heading east, away from most homes in the area. He 
said the fire started about 100 yards into Riverside County, and that an arson 
team was investigating. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Forest Service Fire Capt. Bob DeBaun said preparations were being 
made to fight the fire through the night, and that firefighters were hoping 
that cooler coastal air might aid their efforts. "We try to use weather to our 
advantage," DeBaun said. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Machado, a spokesman for the Forest Service, said his agency was preparing 
to take over at midnight the coordination of firefighting efforts by hundreds 
of volunteers and professionals from nearby jurisdictions. "We'll be here all 
night," he said.

<P>
'BIBLE ANSWER MAN' SUFFERED HEART ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Baptist minister Walter Martin, known to radio listeners as "The Bible Answer 
Man," died after suffering a heart attack, according to Hendrik Hanegraaff, 
chief executive officer of the Christian Research Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, 60, died at his San Juan Capistrano home Monday morning. A coroner's 
report revealed that the heart attack was brought on by a blockage of his right 
coronary artery, which delivers blood to the heart. 
</P>
<P>
Martin was the founder and director of the institute, a nonprofit think tank in 
Irvine that publishes religious material and produces "The Bible Answer Man," 
broadcast weekday afternoons in more than 100 U.S. markets, including local 
KKLA (99.5 FM). 
</P>
<P>
A public memorial service for Martin is scheduled at 7 p.m. Thursday at 
Capistrano Valley Church in San Juan Capistrano.

<P>
A woman suffered minor injuries today when she was struck by a train as it 
approached the Fullerton Amtrak station. 
</P>
<P>
Guadalupe Magdalena, 21, was apparently walking near the railroad track 
bordering Orangethorpe Avenue about a mile from the station when the 7:30 a.m. 
northbound train struck her, Fullerton Police Lt. Al Burks said. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers told police that the train was traveling about 40 m.p.h. when the 
woman was spotted walking north on a pedestrian walkway. The train's horn was 
sounded, and the woman tried to move aside when the train hit her, Burks said. 
</P>
<P>
The train "clipped her on the left shoulder," Burks said. 
</P>
<P>
Magdalena could not remember how she was struck, he said. 
</P>
<P>
She was taken to Anaheim Memorial Hospital's emergency room, where she was 
treated for multiple scrapes and bruises, a hospital representative said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident is under investigation.

PEOPLE /HERBERT J. VIDA: NURSING VETERAN MOUNTS A COLLECTION THAT MAY BE ONLY 
ONE OF ITS KIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Herbert J. Vida 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a nostalgic sort of way, Norma Grundy feels a closeness for her collection 
of bedpans. 
</P>
<P>
After all, she spent much of her life cleaning them. 
</P>
<P>
"I came by it honestly because I'm a nurse," said the nursing director and 
clinic administrator of the mental health division at the UC Irvine Student 
Health Center. "You know, they're fun to look at." 
</P>
<P>
They may be called bedpans by most people today, Grundy said, but those who 
used them decades ago affectionately referred to them as "chamber pots," 
"thunder mugs" and "chambers of delight." 
</P>
<P>
"In years past, a Frenchman would present one to his fiancee as a wedding 
gift," said the Fountain Valley woman, who was the first nurse to work at the 
university's health center when it opened in 1965. She has four children and 
three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Times have changed and so have the shape and material of bedpans, said Grundy, 
who points with pride to the 44 zinc, porcelain, stainless steel and tin 
bedpans that hang on the wall of her small office. 
</P>
<P>
She has decorated some of the older pans with silk flowers, small stuffed 
animals and decoupage poems. One day, she said, she plans to put a clock in her 
small, round, 1800s ceramic model from England. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the most fantastic collection you can imagine," Grundy said. "It's fun 
looking for them and adding them to the collection." 
</P>
<P>
Grundy credits her father for starting the collection. But the display was 
prompted by a colleague at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the psychiatrists on the staff thought my office wasn't bright enough 
and brought in an 18th-Century French chamber pot, and that started the office 
decoration," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And that collection, she jokingly contends, helps troubled students feel 
they're not so bad off in today's society. 
</P>
<P>
"When Chancellor Daniel Aldrich retired four years ago, we had a celebration 
and all of us wore hospital gowns and body stockings and carried the bedpans. . 
. . We used them for drums, and we won first place for the best costumes." 
</P>
<P>
So well known is her collection in and outside the university that theater 
groups throughout the county contact her to use the bedpans when they stage 
Victorian plays. 
</P>
<P>
"The collection just magically grew, and I don't know anyone else that collects 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Many of her bedpans have come from people who know of her collection. "I got 
one from someone who was tearing down their house and found it in a closet, and 
another from a student who saw it on top of a trash can," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Grundy is having fun with her collection and claims to have the best job in the 
world. But the 58-year-old woman also has her sights on the future. "One of 
these days I would really like to join the Peace Corps and teach children how 
to sing and teach mothers how to take care of their children." In 1973, she 
served as the nurse on a World Campus Afloat cruise to the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
But the Peace Corps may be a few years away. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really having a lot of fun now and there's so many surprises in what I'm 
doing. It's a good life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gail Greer never thought her first trip to a weekend wine tasting in Temecula 
would turn into a new life style. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Costa Mesa woman retires next month as purchasing coordinator for 
the Coast Community College District in Costa Mesa, she and her husband, Bruce 
Greer, will return to Temecula as full-time residents and owners of a 10-acre 
vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
They bought their new home and vineyard a year ago and already are selling 
their grapes to two of the 11 wineries in Temecula. 
</P>
<P>
Both are members of the Orange County Wine Society and said they have had some 
success making their own wine. 
</P>
<P>
Does that mean they'll eventually open a winery? "I'm one of those people who 
take one day at a time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledgments -- Saddleback High School graduate Douglas P. Enright, first 
place math and science finisher in the 1988-89 Orange County Academic 
Decathlon, was awarded a $1,000 scholarship from Hughes Aircraft Co. The Santa 
Ana resident is the first to qualify for the new scholarship. Enright, 18, will 
attend UCLA, where he plans to study applied mathematics.

<TEXT>
<P>
A 9-year-old Placentia boy riding his bicycle was critically injured when he 
struck a passing car Tuesday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy, whose name was withheld, suffered major head injuries when he collided 
head-on with a Volkswagen about 7:40 a.m. in the 500 block of north Bradford 
Avenue, next to Valencia High School, Placentia Police Sgt. Jay Fricke said. 
The boy was riding south in the northbound lanes of Bradford when he struck the 
car, throwing him into the windshield. He was taken to United Western Medical 
Center in Santa Ana, where he was listed in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
Fricke said the boy was not wearing a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the vehicle was not injured, and he was not cited at the scene, 
Fricke said.

HOSPITALS' REFUSAL TO TREAT PATIENT FACES STATE INQUIRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Two state Health Services divisions on Tuesday began investigating the death of 
a Westminster man who was refused admission to nine hospitals in Orange, Los 
Angeles and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
Also, another state agency, the Emergency Medical Services Authority, will 
review the case in an effort to avert a similar tragedy, Director Bruce Haynes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, ex-boxer Juan Jimenez Collado, was severely injured May 30 in an 
Imperial Valley traffic accident. He died June 18 in an 80-bed Brawley hospital 
after that facility, acknowledging that it lacked the staff and sophisticated 
equipment to care for Jimenez properly, repeatedly tried and failed to get him 
moved to a larger hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Jimenez's family has charged that the other hospitals refused him because he 
did not have private insurance. But some of the hospitals involved claim they 
did not have any empty beds or a contract to accept state Medi-Cal patients. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, investigators from both the state health agency's licensing 
division and Medi-Cal were actively reviewing the circumstances leading to 
Jimenez's death. 
</P>
<P>
Medi-Cal investigators will study whether any contract hospitals violated their 
agreement with the state by rejecting Jimenez, said Joe Kelly, chief of 
Medi-Cal contract operations. 
</P>
<P>
"In general, a Medi-Cal contract hospital is required to accept any patient who 
needs services at their hospital," although if no doctor there was willing to 
admit Jiminez, there may be no breach of contract, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, licensing investigators in Orange, San Diego and Los Angeles 
counties will look at whether any state regulations were violated when nine 
hospitals declined to accept Jimenez, said Joan Dowling, regional administrator 
for licensing and certification based in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"At the present time, it does not appear from (newspaper accounts) that there 
is a violation, based on what we know about the dumping issues (in which one 
hospitals seeks to unload an indigent patient on another)," Dowling said. "But 
we want to ensure there was no violation of our regulations." 
</P>
<P>
Medi-Cal investigators will look at the following seven contract hospitals that 
declined to accept Jimenez: UCI Medical Center in Orange, Fountain Valley 
Regional Hospital and Medical Center, UCLA Medical Center, UC San Diego Medical 
Center, Sharp Memorial Hospital in San Diego, Mercy Hospital in San Diego and 
Grossmont Hospital in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
State licensing officials will review records at those hospitals, as well as at 
two hospitals without Medi-Cal contracts that also declined to accept Jimenez: 
St. Joseph Hospital in Orange and United Western Medical Center-Santa Ana.

<P>
BILL DODD'S PROMISE IN HIGH SCHOOL STILL A LONG WAY FROM BEING FULFILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
MEMPHIS, Tenn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Dodd and two Chattanooga Lookouts teammates have a soda machine in a death 
grip. It's tilted at a 45-degree angle and they're shaking it, trying to pry 
loose a Pepsi. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd has just come into the stifling, 25-by-25-foot room that passes for a 
visiting club house at Tim McCarver Stadium after finishing his daily 25-minute 
run. Sweat beads on his forehead, now more from the frustration of being gypped 
by this confounded thing than from his jogging in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
After another moment of struggling with the machine, Dodd surrenders, leaving 
the battle to his teammates. He trudges outside to find relief from the heat. 
</P>
<P>
"It's cooler outside anyway," Dodd says. 
</P>
<P>
After about five minutes, his teammates emerge victorious with a soda and hand 
it over to a grateful Dodd. 
</P>
<P>
He finishes gulping just as a group of youngsters approach. 
</P>
<P>
"Are y'all the Cincinnati Reds?" one asks. 
</P>
<P>
"Well . . . ," Dodd says, starting to explain the intricacies of minor league 
affiliations to major league clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"Nah," another breaks in. "They're in the minors." 
</P>
<P>
"Chattanooga, huh?" a third asks. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Dodd confirms with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
The scene, however brief, is another vignette in the tortured baseball life of 
Bill Dodd. After all, it has been a lurching transition from stardom at 
Capistrano Valley High School to minor league mediocrity in the Tennessee 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
As the young fans noticed, the only similarities between the Chattanooga 
Lookouts and the Cincinnati Reds are the hand-me-down warmup jerseys the 
Chattanooga players wear. Dodd knows this, but he's happy just to be playing 
for Chattanooga, the Reds' double-A affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
The path to Chattanooga has taken Dodd through Tempe, Ariz., where a spat with 
a college pitching coach and National Collegiate Athletic Assn. sanctions 
against his school sent him packing for home. As a professional, he has gone 
through such garden spots as Billings, Mont., and Cedar Rapids, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd has endured injury, inflated earned-run averages, broken soda machines and 
bothersome fans as best as could be expected. And he keeps coming back for 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Dodd is scheduled to be the Lookouts' starting pitcher. It's 
his first starting assignment since 1986 and only the fifth in his professional 
career. 
</P>
<P>
At 7 p.m. things are looking good. In fewer than 30 minutes, Dodd will face the 
Memphis Chicks, the last-place team in the Southern League's Western Division. 
The Chicks' team batting average is .244 and they have only two batters hitting 
.300 or better. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:15, Dodd is throwing in the bullpen. His pitches land in the catcher's 
mitt with an impressive "pop." Game time is just a few moments away and Dodd 
appears ready. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:20, a storm hits. 
</P>
<P>
Thunder, lighting and heavy rain send players scurrying for cover and the 
ground crew racing for the tarp. Dodd lingers a moment in the downpour, 
watching the dark sky. Sometimes these Southern storms blow over quickly. Not 
tonight. The game is called after a 90-minute wait. 
</P>
<P>
So why does Dodd continue to endure the angst of the minor leagues? Why would 
an otherwise bright, mature, handsome 22-year-old stick with something that's 
given him so much grief? 
</P>
<P>
The answer comes a day later. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd throws a four-hitter, strikes out seven and walks one in five innings as 
Chattanooga beats Memphis, 7-2, in the first game of a doubleheader. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd's career has been a curious mix of great highs and tremendous lows. One 
day's disappointment slowly, inevitably leads into the next day's success. 
</P>
<P>
"Some days you throw and you're unhittable," Dodd said. "Others I think, 'What 
the hell am I doing out here?' " 
</P>
<P>
Until the victory against Memphis, Dodd's current season has been more failure 
than success. 
</P>
<P>
"So far, it hasn't been a good season," he said. "It's fun when you're doing 
well and the team's doing well. When everything is going right, there's nothing 
better than playing baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Dodd is 3-2 with a 4.09 ERA in 46 innings pitched in 28 games, the slowest 
start of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd said when things are bad, when it's late at night in yet another 
unfamiliar hotel and he's wondering what's wrong with his fastball, he has 
mulled a career change. 
</P>
<P>
He wonders what would have happened if he had earned his degree at Arizona 
State, if he had quit baseball while he was ahead and landed a real job. 
</P>
<P>
"People my age have a degree and all," Dodd said. "I could be playing another 
four or five years and not make the majors. I could be out earning a living 
during that time." 
</P>
<P>
He pauses a beat, then continues. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always the chance I could make it. I have nothing else to lose. It's a 
nice life. You can't beat it. What other job lets you sleep in and watch soap 
operas all afternoon?" 
</P>
<P>
Such indecision hasn't always plagued Dodd. Experience -- good and bad, but 
mostly bad -- has changed him, though. Indeed, Dodd seems older, wiser and more 
mature than his 22 years. A year at Arizona State and four more in the minors 
have been full of, as Dodd puts it, "learning experiences." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Zamora, Capistrano Valley coach, recalls his first meeting with Dodd, who 
was then a hopeful, impressive-looking eighth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
"I met him and his mother," Zamora said. "She said, 'My son's playing baseball 
at (Capistrano Valley) next year and he wants to play major league baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Zamora, accustomed to hearing such wishful thinking, sized up the youngster and 
soon realized it might not be unrealistic to expect Dodd to make it big. 
</P>
<P>
"The overlying word would be confidence," Zamora said. "It's one thing to have 
a goal in life to play in the big leagues. It's a goal of a lot of people. But 
Billy had the size and talent to go along with it. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything came easy to him. In high school it wasn't much of a challenge for 
him. He overpowered everyone." 
</P>
<P>
In his senior season in 1984, Dodd was 10-0 with a 1.72 ERA and 108 strikeouts. 
He batted .425 and hit a county-leading nine home runs. He was second in RBIs 
with 35. 
</P>
<P>
In his three-year varsity career, he was 28-2 and had 300 strikeouts. He was 
named The Times' Orange County player of the year in his junior and season 
seasons. Recently, he was named to The Times' 20th anniversary all-county team, 
joining Angels Bert Blyleven (Santiago) and Mike Witt (Servite) and Jim 
Peterson of Sonora on the first-team pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the statistics, Dodd was 6-feet-4, 200 pounds -- a vision of 
athletic power and skill on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
He picked Arizona State over a pack of other colleges and many figured it was 
only a matter of time before Dodd became one of the nation's top collegiate 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
It never happened. 
</P>
<P>
He never found his niche with the Sun Devils. He was 2-3 with a 7.36 ERA, which 
was not particularly impressive but not terrible for a freshman trying to 
adjust to college baseball in a new role as a relief pitcher. But it wasn't 
statistics that drove Dodd from the school. 
</P>
<P>
A sore elbow and a difference of opinion with pitching coach Tim Kelly 
accounted for most of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd said his elbow hurt; Kelly thought he was malingering. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd went to the trainer, who said there was nothing wrong, at least as far as 
he could tell. 
</P>
<P>
Unconvinced, Dodd went on his own to see orthopedic specialist Dr. Frank Jobe, 
who did not see anything serious either but prescribed rest. 
</P>
<P>
And that caused a bigger rift between Dodd and the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
There was more, though. 
</P>
<P>
In December of 1984, the Sun Devils were placed on two years probation by the 
Pacific 10 Conference for violations in the school's work-study program. They 
were banned from postseason play in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Then in March of 1985, several Arizona State players, including Dodd, were 
found with Nardil, an antidepressant and potentially dangerous mood-altering 
drug. The drug was reportedly used to help players cope with disappointment on 
the playing field, though how they got it was never disclosed. Dodd said he 
never took it, but kept it at home "as a souvenir to keep in the scrapbook." 
Though no players were suspended, the negative publicity about the incident was 
the last thing the school needed, coming on the heels of the NCAA sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
Dodd left after the season ended and decided to attend Saddleback College, not 
far from his Dana Point home. 
</P>
<P>
"It was . . . ," said Dodd, trying to search for the right description of his 
troubled season at Arizona State, "It was weird. I don't think I was ready to 
go to a major, four-year school like that. I probably should have gone to a 
(community college) then transferred. You're at home in Dana Point one minute, 
then they throw you in a dorm in Arizona by yourself. I don't think I was ready 
for that." 
</P>
<P>
After a year of regrouping and confidence-building at Saddleback, Dodd was 
drafted by the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
He was assigned to Billings, the Reds' rookie league team, where he spent the 
1986 and '87 seasons, posting consecutive 5-1 records. 
</P>
<P>
He was promoted to Class-A Cedar Rapids last season and had his best season. 
Dodd was 6-4 with 10 saves and a 2.07 ERA, helping the Reds to the Midwest 
League championship. 
</P>
<P>
Now, midway through his fourth season, Dodd is a veteran of the minors. He 
wonders if he'll be promoted again next season and what the second half of this 
season will be like. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point," he said. "I'd just like to turn my season around. I think if I 
do that, everything will fall into place. I know I can still play. My career's 
not done yet."

RADIO STATIONS KORG-AM AND KEZY-FM REPORTED UP FOR SALE BY ANAHEIM FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County radio stations KORG-AM and KEZY-FM are up for sale, according to 
industry analysts and trade magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Radio Business Report said in its Monday issue that ML Media Partners L.P. had 
reached an agreement to buy the two Anaheim stations for $14 million, but the 
deal fell apart last week. Negotiations between ML and Anaheim Broadcasting Co. 
have reportedly resumed. 
</P>
<P>
ML Media Partners is a public limited partnership formed by former Ziff-Davis 
Broadcasting Co. Chairman I. Martin Pompadur, former ABC president Elton Rule 
and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., the New York-based brokerage house. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen Decline Comment 
</P>
<P>
Representatives for ML and Anaheim Broadcasting declined to comment on the 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
However, several people in the radio industry said it is considered common 
knowledge that KORG (1190) and KEZY (95.9) are on the block. 
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations are still continuing with ML and several other parties," said 
Patrick Clawson, Washington bureau chief and financial editor of Radio &amp; 
Records, an industry publication. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim Broadcasting recently changed the call letters and format of its AM 
station. KORG has an all-talk format, while its predecessor -- KPZE -- carried 
mostly religious programming. KEZY is a Top 40 rock station. 
</P>
<P>
Both target Orange County listeners by airing locally oriented programming 
including news, traffic reports and public service announcements. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County is the 16th largest radio market in the United States, according 
to Sales and Marketing Management, an industry publication. 
</P>
<P>
"If these stations are run properly, they can make very hefty profits," Clawson 
said. "It's a very attractive market because of the high income levels and high 
education levels." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited Reach by Signal 
</P>
<P>
KEZY-FM has a limited reach -- its signal is 2,400 watts and its antenna height 
is only 328 feet, which is tiny compared to, say, KBIG-FM in Los Angeles which 
projects 105,000 watts and has an antenna 2,950 feet above ground level. 
</P>
<P>
But the stations' limited power is attractive to small and medium-size 
businesses based in Orange County that are trying to target local residents. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes sense to a local businessman to advertise on a station like KORG 
because he may have only one location," said Gordon Mason, president of the 
Southern California Broadcasters Assn. "If he buys from a Los Angeles 
metropolitan station, he pays a much higher price and reaches an audience that 
is 60 miles away from his shop." 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Cheen, senior analyst with Paul Kagan Associates, a media research firm 
based in Carmel, said ML is a company that buys and sells radio stations as 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
"Their mission is to find properties, develop them over a three-to-seven-year 
period and then sell them for good returns," Cheen said. 
</P>
<P>
ML owns radio stations in numerous areas including Cleveland, Indianapolis and 
Puerto Rico. The company has two ABC-affiliated television stations in 
Lafayette, La., and Rockford, Ill. It does not own any California radio 
stations, analysts said.

U.S. REGULATORS RUNNING LINCOLN S&amp;L HIRE MANAGER TO LIQUIDATE JUNK BONDS

<P>
Federal regulators running Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan have hired a former 
Orange County thrift executive to liquidate much of Lincoln's junk bond 
portfolio, which consists of more than $400 million in high-risk, high-yield 
corporate bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Becker, 31, will sell the junk bonds over the next year in his role as 
manager of Irvine-based Lincoln's $1.7-billion securities portfolio, which also 
includes less-risky bonds that are backed by home mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
Becker will be working out of Lincoln's administrative offices in Phoenix, a 
few steps away from the S&amp;L's parent firm, American Continental Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln's junk bonds will not be sold at fire-sale prices, nor will all of them 
necessarily be sold, said Mark Randall, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
agent managing the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the proceeds from the junk bond sales will go toward defraying expenses 
that have been increasing the deficit at Lincoln, he said. The S&amp;L slipped 
into insolvency last month. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L's deficit -- liabilities in excess of assets -- was more than $150 
million at the end of May, according to William J. Crawford, commissioner of 
the California Department of Savings and Loan. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators seized Lincoln on April 14, saying that American Continental was 
operating the S&amp;L unsafely and dissipating its $5.3 billion in assets. 
American Continental had filed a bankruptcy petition the previous day to 
protect itself from creditors while it tried to reorganize its debts under 
Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
Becker has worked for regulators for the last 3 1/2 years at the insolvent 
Security Savings &amp; Loan in Scottsdale, Ariz. Previously, he was an 
assistant controller at Western Empire Savings &amp; Loan in Yorba Linda and a 
chief financial officer at Brookside Savings &amp; Loan in Los Angeles.

Imperial Corp. of America, the San Diego-based parent of Imperial Savings of 
California, said it will announce a detailed restructuring plan soon, possibly 
later this week. The plan is intended to put the savings and loan in compliance 
with anticipated new capital requirements to be included in the congressional 
S&amp;L bailout bill. For the past three years, Imperial has been diversifying 
into non-traditional S&amp;L businesses, including "junk bond" investments and 
loans on mobile homes and automobiles. But in January the company suspended its 
dividend and halted asset growth at the insistence of regulators.

<P>
American Continental's bankruptcy is one the largest and most complex 
reorganizations to land in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
With more than 50 subsidiaries -- including 11 that are also in bankruptcy -- 
even American Continental seems to have trouble sorting its financial figures. 
</P>
<P>
In various court documents and public statements, the company gives a wide 
range of numbers for its assets and liabilities. American Continental has 
listed assets of $210 million to $374 million. Its liabilities range from $354 
million to $493 million. 
</P>
<P>
The totals depend on what is included in each category. 
</P>
<P>
On the asset side, for instance, American Continental has a $164-million direct 
investment in its primary subsidiary, Lincoln Savings. But can the company 
claim that investment as an asset since federal regulators seized the 
institution on April 14? American Continental says it's not sure. So sometimes 
it includes the $164 million in its tally of assets, sometimes it doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
On the liability side, a number of factors -- such as whether $55 million in 
preferred stock should be included as a debt -- could result in four different 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
Most often the company reports assets of $355 million and liabilities of $438 
million.

WELLS FARGO JOINS VENTURE TO CRACK JAPANESE MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wells Fargo is teaming up with Nikko Securities to form a high-tech investment 
management firm that will attempt to crack the huge Japanese capital markets. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement announced Tuesday, the San Francisco banking company will 
receive $125 million from Nikko to provide the partnership with the 
computer-based expertise that has made Wells Fargo the largest U.S. money 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
Nikko, one of Japan's four big securities houses, will provide Wells Fargo with 
access to Japanese clients along with the up-front money. 
</P>
<P>
The deal offers Wells Fargo the opportunity to enter the Japanese market 
shortly before a change in the law opens Japan's pension investment management 
business to new competition. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next decade, Wells Fargo estimated, Japanese institutions will invest 
$300 billion to $400 billion in funds managed under "passive," or long-term, 
strategies based on computer models and broad indexes. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for the bank to merge its highly touted Wells Fargo 
Investment Advisors and a related trust unit into the new joint venture. The 
investment subsidiary manages $70 billion for institutional clients, such as 
corporate and government pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
Nikko will pay the $125 million to Wells Fargo for a 50% interest in the 
venture and will direct its passive institutional investment activity to the 
partnership, which will have its headquarters in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The venture will be managed by the existing Wells Fargo team, and its staff of 
200 will become employees of the new entity, which has not been named yet. An 
office also will be opened in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
The price represents nearly 10 times the $13 million in profits of the two 
Wells Fargo units in 1988. When calculated on the basis that Nikko will receive 
half the profits from the joint venture, the price values the units at close to 
20 times earnings. 
</P>
<P>
"The risk is really on Nikko's side because they are putting up the $125 
million," said Perrin Long, an analyst with Lipper Analytical Services in New 
York. "If you look at it that way, it is conceivable that Nikko might not 
recover its investment for five or 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo-based Nikko has been marketing some investment products designed by Wells 
Fargo to its Japanese clients for two years. It also has been stressing the use 
of high-tech computer indexing strategies in a push to expand its 
money-management business worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo's investment subsidiary pioneered the use of indexing -- investing 
in a basket of securities designed to mimic the movement of the market. Under 
the leadership of Frederick L. A. Grauer, the unit has applied quantitative 
strategies to develop long-term portfolios for institutional customers. 
</P>
<P>
"Nikko is a leader in this field in Japan, but they are not nearly as big as we 
are," said Robert L. Joss, a Wells Fargo vice chairman. "The whole modern 
portfolio theory is an American innovation, but the Japanese have picked up on 
it and are adapting it to their markets." 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the deal is important. A letter of intent was negotiated over the 
last 30 months and a final agreement and regulatory approvals in the United 
States and Japan are expected by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Pension fund investments in Japan are controlled by 40 insurance companies and 
trust banks. But in the first quarter of 1990 a new law will open the field to 
other financial companies. 
</P>
<P>
Yasuo Kanzaki, executive vice president of Nikko, said: "This partnership 
ensures our further dominance in investment technology, and thus positions us 
well for the opening of the Japanese pension market." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed joint venture would be the latest partnership between big Japanese 
financial institutions and their U.S. counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
On June 13, Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles said it will sell 5% 
of its consumer and commercial financing subsidiary to Mitsui Bank for $100 
million, which valued the units at about 15 times earnings. 
</P>
<P>
Nomura, the world's largest brokerage, has invested in at least three U.S. 
financial firms, including Wasserstein, Perella &amp; Co., a top New York 
investment bank. Nikko owns a stake in the Blackstone Group, a New York 
investment boutique, and Fuji Bank received approval last week from U.S. 
regulators to form a joint venture with a New York investment firm, James D. 
Wolfensohn International.

GROCERY CHAINS ARE USING BAR CODE DATA TO DETERMINE FOOD PLACEMENT FROM SOUP TO 
NUTS.

Nothing was where it was supposed to be at the Vons supermarket in La 
Crescenta. 
</P>
<P>
Where customers could have picked up pickles a day before, suddenly they were 
peering at Pepperidge Farm cookies instead. And where they once sought salad 
dressing, they saw soup -- and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
Although you couldn't prove it by these mixed-up shoppers, the upheaval was 
part of Vons' effort to make shopping less frustrating for them and, not 
incidentally, more profitable for the company. 
</P>
<P>
By undertaking a massive overnight transformation of the store -- one of about 
160 former Safeway locations -- the grocery hoped to provide a more logical 
store layout, with better placement and added space for fast-selling products. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, some of it seemed like sheer common sense -- putting cookies instead 
of pickles next to the ice cream cases, for example. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fast Response to Changing Tastes 
</P>
<P>
But for figuring out which items to stock -- and where to put them -- Vons 
relied mostly on a new computer-based marketing strategy that is sweeping the 
food industry: shelf space management. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to shelf-management software programs with names such as Accuspace, 
Apollo and Spaceman, many of the nation's big food chains are starting to put 
to better use the flood of sales information that they gather from checkstand 
bar code scanners. 
</P>
<P>
Using the data, they are able to respond to changing tastes by quickly 
reallocating shelf space to provide more room for fast-selling items and to 
boot out any duds. Revampings such as the one at Vons may be rare, but 
customers undoubtedly are noticing subtle changes in the way many stores are 
laid out. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, this provides a method for truly tailoring" stores to 
customers' needs, said Willard Bishop, a Chicago-based retail consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Chains say the technology lets them get away from the cookie-cutter approach of 
the past that meant all stores carried basically the same products in the same 
configuration, without regard for the ethnic makeup or income level of the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
But critics argue that using sales data to determine shelf placement puts small 
food companies with new products at a severe disadvantage by perpetuating the 
power of big marketers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times things are bought because of the way they're made available," 
said Michael Rose, managing partner of Spacemetrics Group in Inglewood, a firm 
that advises retailers on store design. "Usually, when things aren't moving 
well, it's because of where they're placed. Obviously, every manufacturer wants 
his product at eye level." 
</P>
<P>
That may generally be the case, but there are exceptions. According to Vons, 
Best Foods mayonnaise has secured its place as the top-selling brand from the 
bottom shelf. Ditto for Cheerios and Tide, which benefit from deeper shelves 
that can hold more boxes or jars. 
</P>
<P>
Most observers point to the benefits of shelf-management technology. 
</P>
<P>
Analyzing sales data, they say, helps to winnow out slow-moving products so 
that stores can give more space to perennial favorites or promising new items. 
That helps chains better manage inventories and cut down on the persistent 
problem of "out of stocks," which irk customers and reduce sales. 
</P>
<P>
After analyzing consumer "votes" for products on a store-by-store basis, 
retailers can devise computerized descriptions or pictures of shelf layouts, 
known as schematics, that detail how many packages, or "facings," of each 
product appear at the front of the shelf, and where the product will be placed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Automatic Arrangements 
</P>
<P>
Good space management, retailers note, depends on precise package measurements. 
Certified Grocers, a large Los Angeles wholesaler, has on file the dimensions 
of 35,000 grocery items, all measured to "the nearest tenth of an inch," 
according to Jim Swan, manager of the cooperative's shelf allocation program. 
</P>
<P>
The computer software automatically takes the measurements into account when 
determining shelf arrangements. Some programs generate lifelike pictures, with 
digitally produced representations of products. Others spew out written 
descriptions that stockers interpret as they put items on the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
Much of this may seem elementary, but retailers acknowledge that, until the 
advent of bar code scanning and shelf-management programs, they often failed to 
spot and fix trouble on the shelves fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
Take Ralphs Grocery, which solved a persistent problem by using the Spaceman 
program, owned by a subsidiary of A. C. Nielsen Co. The chain, based in 
Compton, found that some stores routinely ran out of paper products but usually 
had an oversupply of bleach. As a result, it added 12 feet of shelf space for 
paper products by stealing space from bleach and other products. 
</P>
<P>
Vons uses the Accuspace program to analyze sales and assign space for stores in 
five "demographic clusters": high Anglo/high income, high Anglo/low income, 
high Latino/low income, high to moderate Latino with no income specified, and 
average, which covers about half of Vons' 342 stores. 
</P>
<P>
At Vons' Tianguis stores, where about 95% of customers are Latino, the dominant 
dairy product is whole milk in gallon jugs. In contrast, at the chain's upscale 
Pavilions stores, customers tend to buy more low-fat or nonfat milk in 
half-gallon containers, so those products get more prominent display. 
</P>
<P>
Vons' mainframe computer has on line about 3,000 schematics featuring a 
category such as pet foods or dairy. Store managers constantly receive revised 
schematics that they follow in rearranging areas of the store to keep pace with 
changing consumer tastes. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to marry different items, such as putting crackers across from soup," 
said Phil Hawkins, vice president of merchandising for El Monte-based Vons. 
"That's something Safeway did not do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5% Sales Increase 
</P>
<P>
Such shifts also grease the way for more impulse purchases. Vons has seen 
increases in the average order size at the former Safeway stores, like the one 
in La Crescenta, that have been remerchandised. 
</P>
<P>
Vons routinely reports sales gains of 2% to 5% that can be traced to shelf 
management, and those are hefty increases for the slim profit margin food 
business, said Frank A. Woodard, director of electronic marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, stocking store shelves is not the simple matter of a few decades ago, 
when merchants would arrange items alphabetically, and clerks would get them 
off the shelves for customers. 
</P>
<P>
As self-service retailing came into vogue, many stores got away from 
alphabetical placement and began to stock products by category. Powerful food 
and consumer product companies began dictating where they wanted their items to 
go -- usually in prime eye-level spots on choice aisles. Smaller companies 
without marketing clout had to settle for less ideal locations, and customers 
would have to stoop or reach to get to their products. 
</P>
<P>
To arrange shelves, store clerks would follow rough line drawings. Or, in some 
cases, a manufacturer's representative would experiment with different 
placements using a magnetic board and tiny magnets that were facsimiles of his 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Such methods were haphazard at best. Carelessly measured items often didn't 
fit. More than occasionally, one company's rep would encroach on another's 
turf. Reordering of products was largely a matter of guesswork. 
</P>
<P>
The method "was very unscientific," said Ken Stevens, a partner at the Los 
Angeles office of McKinsey &amp; Co., a management consulting firm. "It wasn't 
based on sales rates but on impressions of how products were doing." 
</P>
<P>
When food marketers started coming out with thousands of new items or 
variations of established brands each year, retailers could no longer keep up. 
</P>
<P>
With the stiff competition, food and consumer products companies have found 
that shelf space management is a necessary weapon for them, too. Partly in 
self-defense, many food makers provide shelf configurations to retailers, based 
on sales data analyzed by the same shelf management software that retailers 
use. 
</P>
<P>
Carnation, for example, recently revamped the frozen food section, which 
included its own ice cream products, for a St. Louis chain. The category showed 
a 24% sales gain, according to Dick Curd, a spokesman for Carnation, the Los 
Angeles-based division of Nestle. At a Boston chain, a rearranged pet snacks 
section had a 30% increase.

Some observers see shelf management as a subtle form of manipulation that makes 
it too easy for people to buy items they don't need. But Bishop, the 
consultant, disputes that notion. 
</P>
<P>
"Is it manipulation to have some crusty bread on display next to the wine 
section?" he asked. "I think that is very helpful. 
</P>
<P>
"The average customer is not influenced to do things they don't want to do. It 
more than likely will make it easier for them to do something they would like 
to do."

DISNEY HEIR TESTIFIES MILKEN HELPED HIM GET FINANCING FOR BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Roy E. Disney revealed in testimony Tuesday that "junk bond" king Michael 
Milken helped put together financing for a hostile takeover of Walt Disney Co. 
that the Disney heir was considering in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The son of Disney co-founder Roy O. Disney said he decided not to pursue the 
acquisition mainly because the estimated $2.5-billion cost would have meant 
selling parts of the historic firm. He further testified that he allowed Milken 
to take the plan elsewhere. Shortly afterward, corporate raider Saul P. 
Steinberg mounted a bid for the company with the aid of Milken and Drexel 
Burnham Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony came in the trial of a class-action lawsuit by Disney 
shareholders alleging that the company, its directors and Steinberg breached 
their fiduciary duty when the film and theme park company bought Steinberg's 
11% stake at above-market prices. The alleged "greenmail" payment resulted in a 
$59-million profit for Steinberg. Shortly after the transaction, Disney, who 
had resigned from the board earlier that year, rejoined the company as a vice 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
Disney, the first witness in the trial, disclosed behind-the-scenes events that 
were the subject of much conjecture in June, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Disney also divulged that: 
</P>
<P>
* He wrote the board a resignation letter in March, 1984, saying he had "deep 
and unreconcilable philosophical differences" with the management team led by 
Ronald W. Miller, a son-in-law of the late Walt Disney. 
</P>
<P>
* He sent a $350-million offer to Steinberg to buy the film business from Walt 
Disney Co. if Steinberg succeeded in acquiring the company. Nevertheless, he 
said he objected to the buyout of Steinberg as "outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
* As the board was preparing to respond to Steinberg's announced offer, it 
turned down an 11th-hour suggestion by Roy E. Disney for a leveraged buyout by 
Disney family members, including Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Roy E. Disney's testimony also indicated that, without firing a shot himself in 
the takeover battle or risking his fortune, he attained power in Walt Disney 
Co., helped oust the old management and elect a new management team headed by 
Michael D. Eisner in September, 1984. Within two years, the company's stock 
price had increased several hundred percent, the jury was told. Disney conceded 
that he had been hesitant to mount a takeover himself because he would have had 
to borrow heavily to increase his holding in the company. 
</P>
<P>
J. Michael Hennigan, attorney for the shareholders, brought out that the 
witness had strenuously opposed a major Disney acquisition by the Miller 
management in fighting Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
Roy E. Disney said he still does not think the swapping of new Disney stock for 
Arvida Corp., a Florida real estate concern, was good for the company's 
stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
He also gave all credit to the Eisner team for the firm's success, rather than 
the farsightedness attributed to old management by defense lawyers in opening 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by another plaintiffs' lawyer, William Lerach, the witness 
said he thought the buyout of Steinberg was unfair to stockholders and caused 
the market price of Disney stock to plunge afterward. 
</P>
<P>
However, he told defense attorney Michael Diamond that he viewed Steinberg's 
offer as inadequate. He confirmed that he bought large amounts of Disney stock 
after the price fell June 12 because the long-term value was "clearly" greater 
than the market price.

EC NATIONS SET 1990 DEADLINE TO START PROCESS OF MONETARY UNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a major step toward European unity, the 12-nation European Community on 
Tuesday set a deadline of July, 1990, to formally begin the process of monetary 
union. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the EC countries decided that the crucial first step in what is 
expected to be a lengthy journey toward a single currency will start July 1, 
1990, with the lifting of all controls on the transfer of currencies between 
member nations. 
</P>
<P>
They also committed themselves to an intergovernmental conference to chart 
subsequent steps in the process. 
</P>
<P>
"Movement has been started," Jacques Delors, president of the European 
Commission, said at a news conference at the end of a two-day summit meeting 
here. "It is irreversible and will lead to economic and monetary union." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rapid Pace Toward Union 
</P>
<P>
European monetary union, still many years away, would carry major implications 
well beyond Europe. A common European currency, representing the world's 
largest trading bloc with an annual trading volume that exceeds that of the 
United States and is more than twice that of Japan, could quickly become a 
primary competitor to the dollar on global markets. Such a move would do away 
with currencies such as the pound sterling, the franc and the drachma. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement to move forward on an idea that only a few years ago was widely 
viewed as a utopian dream reflects the unexpectedly rapid pace with which the 
community is moving toward unity. 
</P>
<P>
The political momentum generated by this pace was seen as instrumental in 
forcing British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher into concessions that made 
Tuesday's accord possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect a consensus a week ago," said Spanish Prime Minister Felipe 
Gonzalez, who was chairman of the meeting. "Thank God for Mrs. Thatcher." 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference after the meeting, Thatcher left little doubt that she is 
still deeply opposed to both the idea of monetary union and the process leading 
to it, but she agreed to the final document committing Britain to both. 
</P>
<P>
Many observers linked her retreat in part to the drubbing her Conservative 
Party was given last week in elections for Britain's representatives to the 
European Parliament. The party's campaign and her own stridently anti-EC 
rhetoric in the weeks before the election were rejected by British voters, who 
handed the Conservatives their worst defeat in a national election in this 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher had scoffed at the EC report outlining a path toward monetary union 
when it was published last spring. She said she would have nothing to do with 
it. But in the course of the meeting here she detailed for the first time 
conditions under which she would link the British pound to an exchange rate 
mechanism that already binds nine EC currencies in rough parity. 
</P>
<P>
Joining this mechanism is an important prerequisite for any monetary union. Of 
the EC currencies, the pound is the only major unit not in the mechanism, which 
forms the heart of the decade-old European Monetary System. 
</P>
<P>
Although Thatcher refused to discuss timing, the tone of her comments reflected 
a willingness to cooperate that had previously been absent. She also agreed to 
participate in the intergovernmental conference that is to discuss further 
moves toward monetary union once the first stage has begun. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if she would consider boycotting such a conference, she answered: "It is 
never right to leave an empty chair. That leaves us with no influence at all. 
It is a bad policy." 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher's instinctive distaste for big government and her brand of homespun 
popular capitalism have long made her a reluctant participant in the move to 
cede power to a central European bureaucracy, an inherent part of European 
unity. The idea of handing over such a crucial element of power as national 
monetary policy has come especially hard. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be the biggest transfer of sovereignty we've ever had," she said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In what was widely interpreted as a delaying tactic, Thatcher managed to 
prevent complete acceptance of last spring's report on monetary union, compiled 
under the direction of Delors and with the participation of the heads of all 12 
EC central banks. 
</P>
<P>
The report envisions a single currency administered by a system of federated 
central banks similar to the U.S. Federal Reserve System. 
</P>
<P>
According to the final communique, the intergovernmental conference could also 
consider alternative proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"We've accepted the Delors report as a good basis for this further work, but 
not the only basis," Thatcher said. "It will be possible to bring in other 
ideas and approaches." 
</P>
<P>
Delors, who at times has found it difficult to conceal the personal enmity 
between himself and Thatcher, said his report is the only way forward. 
</P>
<P>
"I await her alternative proposals with interest," he said. "It is not easy to 
find the common ground between 12 central bankers. . . . (They) included 
everyone from neo-Keynesians to the ayatollah of monetarism." It was not clear 
to whom Delors was referring. 
</P>
<P>
Delors reacted caustically to Thatcher's assertion at her news conference that 
by agreeing to Tuesday's communique she had merely agreed to a first step on 
the path toward monetary union. He said, "I understand a political strip-tease 
contains a number of stages." 
</P>
<P>
An attempt by French President Francois Mitterrand to commit the community to 
start the intergovernmental conference by the end of 1992 failed to win 
support, but the sense that the community had achieved a breakthrough was 
clearly evident. 
</P>
<P>
"What has happened today is an important step that brings European unity 
closer," Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany said.

NORTHROP'S PROBLEMS; 
</P>
<P>
U.S. ADDS TO NORTHROP INDICTMENT; 
</P>
<P>
ALLEGES FIRM SUPPLIED 200, NOT 17, FAULTY GUIDANCE UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
The Department of Justice amended its criminal indictment against Northrop and 
two top executives Tuesday, adding 22 counts to allegations that the firm 
improperly tested and sold defective guidance systems for nuclear-armed cruise 
missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop and two officials were charged with conspiracy and fraud in a 
167-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in April. In addition to 
cruise missiles, the indictment accused the firm of supplying defective 
equipment for AV-8B Harrier jets, used by the Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. William Fahey said Tuesday that the new indictment 
contains significant allegations that Northrop supplied more defective guidance 
units than originally thought. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleges that Northrop sold 200 defective guidance units, called 
flight data transmitters, and produced at the firm's Western Services 
Department in Pomona. The original indictment alleged the firm had shipped only 
17 defective units. 
</P>
<P>
A Northrop spokesman said the allegations against the firm and two of its 
executives are unwarranted and that the firm "strongly disputes any allegation 
of criminal behavior." 
</P>
<P>
The Northrop executives under indictment are Joseph Yamron, a corporate vice 
president and the general manager of the firm's precision products division in 
Newton, Mass., and Vice President Leopold Engler of the same division. Yamron 
and Engler are on leave from Northrop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Freezing Problem 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Justice Department filed a related motion in the case in which 
it put on file a report that Engler wrote to Yamron in August, 1983, that 
indicated fluids used in Northrop gyroscopes did not meet contractual 
specifications. 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department has alleged that Northrop continued to use the fluid for 
several years after the report was written, even though it knew that the fluid 
would not meet a requirement that it not freeze at 65 degrees below zero. 
</P>
<P>
The Engler report concludes that the fluid "does not meet the -65 F requirement 
and never did." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the criminal indictment, the Justice Department has filed two 
civil suits against Northrop, one alleging fraud in the same cruise missile 
parts involved in the criminal charges and the other involving MX missile 
system parts. 
</P>
<P>
The civil suit involving the cruise missile parts alleges that Northrop failed 
to properly test the equipment. Cantafio said that the Justice Department had 
"quietly" amended its civil law suit against Northrop on the cruise missile. 
</P>
<P>
The changes apparently withdraw allegations that the guidance systems are 
defective. (The allegations in the civil and criminal cases are not identical.) 
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department "quietly removed the doubt about the flight data 
transmitters' reliability in the field," Cantafio said. He said the equipment 
has not failed in 96 flight tests of the missile. 
</P>
<P>
The amended civil complaint seeks damages for only testing and inspection of 
the guidance systems, rather than the full price of the equipment as originally 
requested, he noted.

Pilots Union Seeks Mediation: The Air Line Pilots Assn. asked federal mediators 
to intervene in talks with strikebound Eastern Airlines, a request that could 
complicate the troubled carrier's plans to reorganize. The union made the 
request of the National Mediation Board even as it continued negotiations with 
Eastern in talks ordered by the bankruptcy judge overseeing the airline, which 
filed for protection from its creditors after its machinists union struck in 
March. A Mediation Board spokesman said the request had not been logged in as 
of the close of business. The request for mediation could trigger a pilots' 
strike as well.

Kraft Inc. announced Tuesday that it is mailing $250 checks to hundreds of 
people who claim that they won a $17,000 van that was supposed to be the grand 
prize in a botched contest. 
</P>
<P>
Letters accompanying the checks say the payment "represents our appreciation 
for your understanding and good will" and that the company is "sorry for any 
confusion or disappointment the flawed game may have caused." 
</P>
<P>
Because of a printing error, the "Ready to Roll" game pieces Kraft offered last 
month in newspapers in the Chicago and Houston areas matched virtually all game 
pieces in packages of Kraft cheese, making hundreds, possibly thousands, of 
people apparent winners of a 1990 Dodge Caravan. 
</P>
<P>
The company nullified the contest June 12 after the error was discovered, 
prompting at least two class-action lawsuits by would-be winners.

May Department Stores Co. said Tuesday that it is exploring the possibility of 
selling its Caldor and Venture discount chains. 
</P>
<P>
Divesting the two general merchandise discounters would enable the retailer to 
more easily pursue its intention to concentrate on its department store and 
shoe businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"The divestiture of Caldor and Venture will allow May to focus on the 
operations and expansion of our higher-return and faster-growing businesses," 
said David C. Farrell, May chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
May, one of the largest retailers in the country and owner of Lord &amp; 
Taylor, Hecht's, Sibley's, plus other department stores and specialty shoe 
chains, including the May Co. in Southern California, said it anticipates using 
a significant portion of the proceeds from a possible sale to buy back its 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
The company's stock closed Tuesday up $1.75 at $41.875 in New York Stock 
Exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
The remainder of any sale proceeds would be spent on general corporate 
purposes, including investment in the department store operations and shoe 
businesses, the company said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
May management has been working to restore Caldor to higher levels of 
profitability and had recently expressed optimism about Caldor's prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Caldor, which operates in the Northeast, was taken over by May in 1986 as part 
of its acquisition of Associated Dry Goods. Caldor's operating earnings were 
$50 million in 1988 on sales of $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
May launched Venture in 1970. It operates in the Midwest and last year had 
operating income of $81 million on sales of $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Both Venture and May sell a range of items including hard line goods, such as 
appliances, and soft line goods, such as clothing. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas A. Hays, May's president, described Caldor and Venture as two 
"well-positioned businesses with excellent management and committed 
associates." 
</P>
<P>
As a condition of any sale, May will insist on provisions regarding jobs, 
compensation and benefits for Caldor's and Venture's employees. 
</P>
<P>
Retail industry analysts had expected that May eventually would shed Caldor and 
Venture.

Imperial Corp. to Restructure: Imperial Corp. of America, the San Diego-based 
parent of Imperial Savings of California, said it will announce a detailed 
restructuring plan soon, possibly later this week. The plan is intended to put 
the savings and loan in compliance with anticipated new capital requirements to 
be included in the congressional S&amp;L bailout bill. For the past three 
years, Imperial has been diversifying into non-traditional S&amp;L businesses, 
including "junk bond" investments and loans on mobile homes and automobiles. 
But in January the company suspended its dividend and halted asset growth at 
the insistence of regulators.

Great Western Will Appeal Ruling: Great Western Financial said it will appeal a 
court ruling that would prevent its main subsidiary from leaving the Federal 
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. and joining the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp. The ruling came after Great Western sued last month to overturn a 
decision by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which had turned down a request 
by FSLIC-insured Great Western Bank to merge with its FDIC-insured affiliate in 
the state of Washington. Great Western asked the Los Angeles court to declare 
the regulatory decision unlawful and approve the merger. Great Western will now 
ask the same court to reconsider its ruling.

John Chan sipped a glass of water and briefly closed his bloodshot,

<P>
"Those were very sad events, indeed," Chan told reporters in New York during a 
visit that followed the Chinese government's crackdown on the pro-democracy 
movement. "It is time to be humble about our lack of knowledge about what is 
going on in China." 
</P>
<P>
For the frenetic colony of free enterprise that sits like a fragile egg on the 
southern Chinese frontier, the bloodletting fractured a veneer of confidence 
that China will permit Hong Kong to maintain its way of life for 50 years after 
the 1997 takeover, as promised under a historic Sino-British pact. 
</P>
<P>
The June 3-4 killings and their aftermath devastated prices in the Hong Kong 
stock market, weakened property values, led to record requests for emigration 
visas and drained bank vaults as many depositors spirited their money abroad, 
fearing more turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Even Hong Kong optimists began to quietly question whether Britain made a grave 
mistake five years ago by agreeing to surrender the colony, a vestige of Opium 
War days that has since blossomed into one of the most fabulously successful 
industrial and financial centers of Asia. 
</P>
<P>
For Chan, a 46-year-old, native Hong Kong Chinese who speaks flawless 
British-accented English, the Beijing crackdown and its impact on the colony 
have presented the greatest challenge of his career and personal life. 
</P>
<P>
Chan must try to convince Americans and other foreigners with billions of 
dollars invested in Hong Kong that their money and property not only are safe 
but also will grow in value during the pre-takeover years and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
He also must try to persuade Hong Kong's 6 million people to trust that China 
will honor its pledge to leave them alone after the scarlet hammer-and-sickle 
flag replaces Britain's Union Jack on July 1, 1997 -- the official termination 
of British authority under the joint declaration. 
</P>
<P>
"What gives the Sino-British agreement its teeth is that it's a binding 
agreement," Chan said during his trip earlier this month to Washington and New 
York, where he expounded on the virtues of Hong Kong's economy to lawmakers and 
business groups, and rejected suggestions that the territory is doomed. 
</P>
<P>
"China has an excellent track record of honoring its international 
commitments," he said. "Even in the dark days of the Cultural Revolution, the 
Chinese honored their agreements. They kept Hong Kong supplied with food and 
water." 
</P>
<P>
In his view, China not only will protect Hong Kong's way of life, but also will 
continue exhorting its entrepreneurs to share their expertise with the rest of 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
Chan is a senior native Hong Kong member of the British administration and has 
been a career colonial official for the past 25 years, with posts that have 
ranged from government spokesman to the governor's private secretary. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps for that reason, Chan has no choice but to put the best face on a 
potentially explosive problem and has gone out of his way to show that he wants 
to stay in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
He was deeply involved in the negotiations that climaxed with the Sino-British 
agreement in 1984 and is a member of the Sino-British Land Commission, a body 
established under the agreement to oversee the sale and allocation of property 
in the years up to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 he became deputy chief secretary and was responsible for formulating 
constitutional reforms aimed at giving Hong Kong a democratically elected 
government prior to the Chinese takeover. He became trade and industry 
secretary in March. 
</P>
<P>
His responsibilities now include Hong Kong's international trade relations and 
its involvement in world commercial organizations, such as the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike his British colleagues, however, Chan does not have a British passport 
or right of residence in Britain. He grew up and went to school in Hong Kong. 
He lives there with his wife and two children. He recently purchased an 
apartment in Hong Kong and said he does not keep any overseas bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
"My family and I remain committed to Hong Kong," he said. "I was born here; my 
father was born here." 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, he said, "is not China. It is not going to be run by China. It will 
be run by Hong Kong people under the agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, events in China over the past few weeks have jolted many other 
Hong Kong people into concluding that the Beijing government has no regard for 
international opinion when confronted with a threat to its political supremacy. 
In the view of skeptics, if Hong Kong eventually is seen by the Chinese 
Communist Party as a destabilizing influence on the rest of the country, it 
would use whatever means necessary to fortify itself at Hong Kong's expense. 
</P>
<P>
This scenario strikes the deepest fear into the Hong Kong government because it 
raises the possibility of chaos. Many Hong Kong residents are refugees of past 
Chinese political convulsions and now have no place to go. Britain has made no 
special arrangements to accept them. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, Chan and other members of Hong Kong's colonial administration 
recently began to press London to reconsider its immigration policy concerning 
Hong Kong residents. 
</P>
<P>
"Britain has a moral obligation to the people of Hong Kong," Chan said. "They 
want to acquire an insurance policy, a home of last resort, if things really 
turn bad." 
</P>
<P>
The lukewarm response of the British thus far, Chan said, "indicates this is 
not an easy matter for them." 
</P>
<P>
Chan admitted that he is not a trained Sinologist and that the stunning 
crackdown on political dissidents in China took him by surprise. Nonetheless, 
Chan said, if it had to happen, he is grateful it happened in 1989, not 1996. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the silver linings on this dark cloud is that it's given Hong Kong 
people a hard shock -- like an injection, an immunization against the next rude 
shock," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for his own future under the Chinese Communist umbrella, Chan smiled 
philosophically. 
</P>
<P>
"If I do well in the next eight years," he said, "maybe I'll get a promotion."

TIME SEEKS TO PULL MCA EXECUTIVES INTO BUYOUT BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In its messy battle to fend off a hostile takeover bid by Paramount 
Communications, Time Inc. now seems willing to bruise a corporate bystander by 
demanding sworn testimony from MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman and MCA President 
Sidney J. Sheinberg. 
</P>
<P>
MCA and Paramount are partners in overseas film distribution as well as USA 
Network, a cable television channel. Among other things, Time has requested 
contracts concerning the cable network's ownership, according to MCA. 
</P>
<P>
The Time maneuver was made public Tuesday when MCA lawyers asked a federal 
judge in Los Angeles to quash deposition subpoenas for Wasserman and Sheinberg. 
MCA asked the court to hear the matter Thursday -- the same day Time hoped to 
take the MCA executives' testimony. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, an attorney representing Time said that to his knowledge, 
depositions are not being sought at any other Hollywood studios. "There is 
nothing I can tell you about it. We have reason to believe they may know 
something relevant," said John Beerbower, a partner of Cravath, Swaine &amp; 
Moore. 
</P>
<P>
"We think there's no basis for it," said Ronald L. Olson, the Los Angeles 
attorney representing MCA. "We don't know anything about the Paramount offer, 
which is the (basis of the) dispute." 
</P>
<P>
An initial round between Time and MCA ended in a draw last Friday when Time 
tried unsuccessfully to serve the subpoenas at MCA's "Black Tower" 
headquarters. The process server was barred from the executive suite, according 
to MCA's filing, but "threw the subpoenas at a security guard in the parking 
lot . . . then knocked the guard to the ground with his motorcycle as he drove 
away."

PEOPLE: FED BANK OF SAN FRANCISCO CREATES 95 NEW JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The growth in the volume of checks and cash being processed has caused the Los 
Angeles branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco to reorganize 
operations and hire 95 new employees. 
</P>
<P>
John H. Taylor has been appointed to the new position of senior vice president 
and assistant branch manager. The former Texas and North Carolina banker will 
have direct responsibility for all branch operations and related customer 
service and administrative areas. 
</P>
<P>
The sharpest increase in volume is a result of federal regulations last fall 
requiring banks to make funds available faster when people deposit checks. The 
change means that banks are routing more returned checks through the Federal 
Reserve system, which acts as a clearinghouse for financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The volume is up 48% so far this year at the Los Angeles branch, which serves 
about 2,000 banking offices in Southern California, southern Nevada and 
Arizona. As a result of general population growth, the branch is also handling 
37% more volume in its cash operation, which processes currency, coins and food 
coupons. 
</P>
<P>
Reporting to Taylor will be three existing branch directors, Edward A. Bonheur, 
Charles L. Huffstetler and Mary Ellen Martin. The branch also added Frank A. 
Bentley as an officer in payment services, where he joins Thomas W. Rodewald. 
Mark W. Fishback, formerly the branch savings bonds manager, has been promoted 
to cash operations officer.

APPLE EMPLOYEE FIRED FOR LEAKING INFORMATION

Apple Computer, which fired a programmer for leaking information, has served 
notice that there will be "sanctions" against any employee who breaches its 
security. 
</P>
<P>
David Ramsey, 33, author of Apple's MacPaint 2.0 program, said he was fired 
Thursday for using the CompuServe electronic bulletin board to disclose 
information. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Escher said Monday that Apple has "a commitment to open communication and 
that environment is based on trust. 
</P>
<P>
"All employees have sensitive material in their hands every day, and we expect 
them to act with good judgment regarding that information. Implicit in that 
environment is an agreement that there must be limits and sanctions on people 
who break that trust." 
</P>
<P>
Ramsey said he did not know that the information put out by CompuServe was 
"confidential." He said he believed that it had already been discussed by Apple 
Chairman John Sculley. 
</P>
<P>
Ramsey began working at Apple two years ago.

UAL STOCK RISES SHARPLY ON RUMOR BASS BOUGHT STAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The stock of UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, rose $6.75 on Tuesday, with 
the primary reason apparently being an unconfirmed report that a group headed 
by Texas investor Robert M. Bass had begun to acquire the stock. 
</P>
<P>
But the increase -- to $146 a share -- was the result of a number of reasons, 
observers maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Some large UAL shareholders and analysts said the stock has been "undervalued" 
and is just catching up to other airline stocks. Compared to the stocks of 
American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, UAL has been "selling for less than it 
should, and the gap is now closing," said one large shareholder of UAL who 
asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
There has been considerable speculation in airline stocks in recent days, the 
result of the $121-per-share offer for NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
"The Northwest situation has put takeover pressure on other airline stocks," 
said Robert Decker, an airline analyst with the Chicago consulting firm of Duff 
&amp; Phelps. "Everyone is guessing who will be next -- and that distinction is 
going to UAL." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper USA Today reported Tuesday that Bass' group had bought between 
2.5% and 3% of UAL's stock. 
</P>
<P>
A UAL spokeswoman said the company "declines comment on the current stock 
activity." A spokesman for Bass also declined to comment.

BLUE CHIPS LEAD RALLY AS DOW ADVANCES 14.99 
</P>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stock prices rallied Tuesday on the strength of declining interest rates and 
rising oil company shares. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, which declined 20.49 points Monday, 
finished up 14.99 at 2,526.37. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outpaced decliners by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 916 up, 546 down and 504 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 171.09 million shares, up from 143.60 million Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The market was lifted by strength in blue chip stocks and some program-related 
buying, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
Blue chips climbed steadily through the afternoon, but late profit taking 
erased some of the day's advance, which had brought the Dow near its post-crash 
high. 
</P>
<P>
Declining interest rates in the bond market -- where prices rose by $9.70 per 
$1,000 in face value on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond -- helped propel 
stocks higher, analysts said. Lower interest rates improve the outlook for 
corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
"We're back to the same old lock-step environment," said Peter Barry, director 
of research at Fahnestock &amp; Co. "The dollar -- the flight to safety 
worldwide -- is taking bonds up and lower interest rates are taking stocks up." 
</P>
<P>
The stock market advanced last week to new post-crash highs amid gathering 
signs of a slowing economy, which were seen as indicators that inflation and 
would not accelerate and interest rates would be stable or lower. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market also received a boost from the strength of key blue 
chip stocks, especially IBM, which rose 2 1/4 to 114 1/4 as the most actively 
traded stock. Digital Equipment, another key technology issue, rose 3 5/8 to 95 
1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the gains also reflected how large institutional investors were 
attempting to complete their second-quarter trading before the July 4 holiday 
weekend to prepare midyear portfolio reports for clients. 
</P>
<P>
Oil company stocks rose broadly because of a rise in crude oil prices, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Chevron gained 2 1/2 to 55 3/8, Atlantic Richfield rose 1 1/4 to 94 5/8, Amoco 
increased 1 1/2 to 46 1/4, Mobil gained 1 7/8 to 51 3/8 and Texaco was up 1 1/4 
to 50 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stock prices tumbled Tuesday, closing sharply lower after computerized 
selling programs put downward pressure on a broad range of sectors. The 
225-share Nikkei index fell 156.61 to close at 33,469.21. 
</P>
<P>
Share prices ended sharply higher on the London Stock Exchange as fears of a 
rise in British interest rates were soothed by a surprising narrowing of the 
British trade deficit in May. The Financial Times 100-share index finished at 
2,206.4, up 26.8. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury bond yields fell to two-year lows Tuesday on sentiment that the 
economy is slowing and interest rates are declining. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond surged 31/32 point, or $9.70 for every 
$1,000 in face value. Its yield tumbled to 8.07% from 8.15% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said it was the lowest yield since early April, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"Yields pierced 8% on the upside (then), and we never saw it again," said Jay 
Goldinger, market analyst at the investment firm Capital Insight in Beverly 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the rally in bonds was fueled by a growing belief that the 
economy is slowing, even though there was no fresh news on the economy Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Schlossberg, vice president and senior economist with Wells Fargo &amp; 
Co., said bond investors, rather than buyers of short-term bills and notes, are 
playing the lead role in pushing rates down. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9.438%, down from 9.50% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Prices of wheat futures bounded to a six-week high on the Chicago Board of 
Trade in anticipation of further buying of U.S. wheat by the Soviet Union, 
which apparently is strapped for supplies. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, livestock and meat futures were mostly lower while oil and 
precious metals futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat settled 0.50 cent to 10.75 cents higher, with the contract for delivery 
in July at $4.125 a bushel; corn was 3.75 to 5 cents higher, with July at 
$2.6275 a bushel; oats were 4.75 to 5.50 cents higher, with July at $1.535 a 
bushel, and soybeans were 8 to 13 cents higher, with July at $7.385 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
The rally pushed wheat futures to their highest level since May 15 and erased 
most of Monday's steep losses in the corn, soybean and oat markets. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the other grain markets, wheat futures had risen Monday on rumors the 
Soviets had bought up to 500,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at market prices, an 
indication they had an immediate need for the grain. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar drifted lower against all major currencies except the Japanese yen 
in thin, choppy trading. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York quoted an ounce of gold at 
$375.25 as of 4 p.m. EDT, up $1.25 from late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said that sentiment toward the dollar remains bullish but that 
many traders were reluctant to buy the currency before the Independence Day 
holiday and in the absence of any market-moving news. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar came under pressure abroad Tuesday on a report that the West German 
Bundesbank might consider an interest rate hike at a meeting Thursday of its 
central bank council. 
</P>
<P>
The battered British pound, meanwhile, gained ground against the dollar, helped 
by a surprising narrowing in the British trade deficit in May and news that 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher agreed with other European leaders on plans 
toward monetary union. 
</P>
<P>
At least two rounds of intervention by the Bank of England also encouraged the 
pound's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the pound cost $1.5640, more expensive than $1.5450 late Monday. 
Sterling bought $1.5660 later in New York, up from $1.5450. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
rose 1.05 yen to a closing 141.23 yen. It was quoted lower at 141.07 yen in 
London and at 141.75 yen in New York, up from 141.10 yen late Monday.

BURGER WARS INVADE HOSPITAL LOBBY WITH PLANS FOR A NEW MCDONALD'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH J. MANN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plans to open a McDonald's franchise at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles next 
month has hospital officials, doctors and nutritionists embroiled in a sizzling 
debate over nutrition and ethics. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant, which will serve a traditional McDonald's menu plus soups and 
fresh fruit, is the first of its kind in a California hospital. Scheduled to 
open July 10 just off the hospital's main lobby, the restaurant will be the 
12th hospital-based McDonald's in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital administrators said the McDonald's will be good for business. But 
parents, staff physicians, nutritionists and health groups nationwide question 
whether a fast-food restaurant -- which offers foods high in calories and 
cholesterol along with salads and bran muffins -- is appropriate in a hospital 
for children. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. T. Y. Lawrence, a cardiologist at Childrens Hospital, said she worries 
about the cooking oils and the high cholesterol content of many fast foods, 
although she acknowledges that the issues the hospital faces are complicated. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not recommend anyone to set foot in there," Lawrence said. "But I have 
to consider the hospital budget. (McDonald's) is helping the budget in other 
ways. You can't have everything." 
</P>
<P>
The American Cancer Society also opposes the move. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not the kind of thing we are real excited about," said American Cancer 
Society spokeswoman Sally Brother. "It is not a very good message to be sending 
to kids concerning what good eating is about." 
</P>
<P>
The McDonald's is for the convenience of staff and visitors, not patients, 
stressed Dr. Carl M. Grushkin, Childrens Hospital medical director. Patients 
will be allowed to eat there only with doctor approval, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital cafeteria will remain open, although its hours will be scaled back 
slightly, and the grill, which features hamburgers and hot dogs, will be 
eliminated. McDonald's will not close its doors until 11 p.m, four hours after 
the cafeteria is dark, Grushkin said. 
</P>
<P>
The food the patients receive in their rooms is tailored to their specific 
dietary needs and is not the same as that sold in the hospital cafeteria, 
according to hospital nutrition officials. With a doctor's approval, patients 
may also order food from the cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital administrators two years ago began negotiations with McDonald's to 
open a franchise at the 331-bed private facility, in part to offset the 
$650,000 lost by the cafeteria annually. Several other chains, including 
Wendy's and Burger King, also have restaurants in hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
"I am hoping we can stop losing money or stop losing as much," Grushkin said. 
"Whether we are going to recoup it is another issue." 
</P>
<P>
But contract negotiations between the fast-food chain and the hospital moved 
slowly because staff physicians were unsure whether they wanted the McDonald's, 
said Steve Roth, McDonald's manager of hospital development. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Doctors Visit Other Sites 
</P>
<P>
The deal was closed only after a group of doctors visited other McDonald's 
restaurants in hospitals around the country, Roth noted. Grushkin said he was 
unaware of any turmoil among his staff over the contract. 
</P>
<P>
In-hospital McDonald's restaurants elsewhere in the country have drawn mixed 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
In St. Louis, where a McDonald's opened three years ago in Christian Hospital 
North East, the restaurant remains a sore spot. 
</P>
<P>
"The McDonald's is still considered controversial because of the 
high-cholesterol, high-fat content of all fast foods," said Rick VanBokkelen, 
Christian Hospital's executive vice president. "I think it is a success in our 
hospital, but I am sure there are people in St. Louis who would violently 
disagree." 
</P>
<P>
And at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where the first hospital-based 
McDonald's opened in 1977 to replace an overburdened coffee shop, hospital 
officials do not recommend the restaurant as a steady diet. 
</P>
<P>
"We reasoned that people wouldn't eat there every day," said hospital 
spokeswoman Shirley Bonnem. "The fact of life is people are going to eat fast 
food unless they are nutrition buffs." 
</P>
<P>
Many of McDonald's most popular items are chock-full of calories. A Big Mac has 
562 calories. A regular bag of french fries adds 220 calories and a chocolate 
milkshake racks up 388 calories -- bringing the total meal to 1,170 calories. 
</P>
<P>
For those with willpower, a McDonald's chef salad with a vinaigrette dressing 
is 246 calories. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Caloric Intake 
</P>
<P>
The National Academy of Sciences recommends that men between the ages of 23 and 
50 restrict their daily calorie intake to 2,700 and women in the same age group 
to about 2,000. For children between the ages of 4 and 6, the recommended daily 
calorie allotment is 1,700. 
</P>
<P>
Childrens Hospital visitors who routinely ordered cheeseburgers and french 
fries at the hospital cafeteria probably will not be much worse off if they 
order those same items at McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
A hospital cheeseburger is 479 calories, according to a staff nutritionist, 
while a McDonald's quarter-pounder with cheese is 517. For dessert, a serving 
of McDonald's apple pie at 262 calories is actually about 40 calories less than 
a serving of apple pie from the hospital cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
Grushkin discussed the new venture with guarded enthusiasm. "The food is 
generally quite nutritious," Grushkin said. "There are a lot of things you 
could get there on a balanced diet, but you have to select very carefully." 
</P>
<P>
But Grushkin conceded that McDonald's is not a place he would like to eat at 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope I don't go there a lot," Grushkin said. "I will eat there from time to 
time." 
</P>
<P>
The hospital is planning an education campaign for patients, staff, and 
visitors specifically tailored to the McDonald's menu, but the details have not 
been worked out, said Linda Brown, director of food and nutrition services. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Goldblatt, McDonald's director of nutrition, said the fast-food 
chain uses only the best ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Highest Quality Food' 
</P>
<P>
"The taste of McDonald's food speaks for itself," Goldblatt said. "Without a 
doubt, McDonald's is of the highest quality food you can get anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
But several physicians and health care professionals strongly disagree. 
</P>
<P>
"It is shameful," said Michael Jacobson, director of Washington-based Center 
for Science in the Public Interest. "Hospitals are seen as images of health. 
It's sneaky to associate images of health with unhealthy food." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Liz Applegate, a lecturer in nutrition at UC Davis, said fast food is the 
last thing parents need when they are under stress. 
</P>
<P>
"Here put in front of them (at McDonald's) is high-fat food which is also low 
in nutritional content," Applegate said. "Parents are in need of a balanced 
diet especially because in dealing with a child's illness they've probably not 
been eating well." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jackson, an Inglewood piano tuner who brought his son to the hospital 
recently, said he could do without the added convenience. 
</P>
<P>
"I think McDonald's is bad for kids," Jackson said. "I try to avoid feeding 
them that kind of thing, but if it it's right here in front their faces, it is 
hard to weasel out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's 7-year-old son, who is also named Michael, disagrees with his dad. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so much fun," the second grader said. "I don't like salad, but I could 
really take a 'Happy Meal.' " 
</P>
<P>
The young Jackson is not alone. Chances are, noontime crowds will not be 
clamoring for fruit and salad, nutritionist Applegate said. Studies show the 
more nutritious items often draw people inside a fast-food restaurant, but when 
it comes to ordering, the high-calorie, high-cholesterol items are 
irresistible, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fran Jones, who will operate the hospital franchise, said she is dedicated to 
showing kids a good time. 
</P>
<P>
They can ride Mr. Hamburger in the restaurant's enclosed play area, listen to a 
story told by the talking apple tree, or chance a visit by Ronald McDonald, who 
is already booked for six monthly appearances, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conveniences for Employees 
</P>
<P>
With a seating capacity of about 160, the restaurant also offers special 
conveniences for hospital employees. Doctors and nurses can be paged there and 
express lines will be set up to speed the process for staff members at peak 
hours, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones operates two other restaurants in Southern California. She also serves on 
the board of directors of the Los Angeles Ronald McDonald House, a home for 
families of hospitalized children subsidized in large part by McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the criticism, in some situations a visit to McDonald's could be 
just what the doctor orders, according to Grushkin. Patients who have undergone 
chemotherapy often lose their taste for hospital food and may go without 
eating, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
"It is important to get cancer patients to eat something high in calories -- 
french fries, milkshakes, cheeseburgers," Grushkin said. "Not as a steady diet, 
but it is better than nothing." 
</P>
<P>
The golden arches are firmly planted at Childrens Hospital. McDonald's has a 
20-year contract there although the hospital can call off the deal earlier if 
the quality of the food slips below standard, said McDonald's Roth. Roth and 
Grushkin declined to disclose the amount of rent the restaurant is paying the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
There is no guarantee McDonald's will bolster finances at Childrens Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
At Denver General Hospital, where McDonald's has been open for about a year, 
the fast-food restaurant has not helped the hospital's bottom line one bit, 
said hospital administrator William D. Wild. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever we get from McDonald's is offset in revenues we've lost from the 
cafeteria," Wild said. "If we went into this for financial reasons, it hasn't 
panned out." 
</P>
<P>
To cut the loss, Wild said he is considering eliminating cafeteria service 
entirely at breakfast and dinner, leaving McDonald's as the only on-site option 
for those meals. 
</P>
<P>
It is highly unlikely Childrens Hospital will resort to such an idea, Grushkin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Only One Considered 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's was the only fast-food chain the hospital considered for the spot, 
Grushkin said. 
</P>
<P>
When McDonald's wants a hospital franchise, it has no true competition, said 
Wendy's spokesman Denny Lynch. "They can pay too much for property and too much 
in rent. They can sit on (a restaurant) until they make money." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald's Roth is the first to admit the company has invested in hospitals 
with an eye toward the future. 
</P>
<P>
"It is definitely intended to be for profit," Roth said. "We want to be in 
these sites for the next hundred years."

CITY COUNCIL REJECTS PLAN TO TAKE OVER CRA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A divided Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday rejected a proposal to take over 
the multibillion-dollar Community Redevelopment Agency, an action that could 
set the stage for a public referendum on social spending in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we are out of touch with the public, and I think it's very likely the 
public will have the opportunity to voice its feelings on the issue either next 
June or next November," said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, the author of the 
proposal, which garnered six yes votes and nine no's. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council did vote Tuesday to strengthen its control over the 
tax-supported redevelopment agency, which has been at the center of a gathering 
storm over how much of its resources the city should devote to providing 
shelter, job training, child care and other services to the city's poor. 
</P>
<P>
With a yearly budget exceeding $500 million and authority to spend as much as 
$6 billion over the next decade, the CRA's spending program is seen by many as 
a gauge of the city's commitment to poor people. For the last year, the agency 
has come under heavy fire by activists and by some elected officials for 
devoting too much of its resources to subsidizing commercial development and 
expensive housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley, who has been blamed along with the council for 
not redirecting the CRA's resources, had hoped to temper the controversy with a 
plan to devote at least $2 billion of the CRA's funds to low-income housing and 
child care. By law, Bradley and the council share responsibility for the CRA. 
However, the mayor has been more aggressive than the council in charting agency 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the council voted to give itself authority to review CRA budgets 
and work programs before they are approved by the agency's commission, 
appointed by Bradley. In addition, the council gave itself veto power over 
agency decisions. The council also created a new committee to review CRA 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
For 12 years the council has grappled with the question of CRA oversight. 
Critics have accused the council of hesitating to police the agency more 
aggressively because so many members have reaped political benefits from 
development that the CRA has underwritten in their districts. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members argued that all the council did Tuesday was put in writing 
authority it has always had but declined to exercise. But others said that the 
council's action both clarified and enhanced its authority. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives us the ability to have complete oversight of the CRA without actually 
taking it over," said Councilman Hal Bernson, who helped fashion the council's 
new relationship with the CRA. 
</P>
<P>
"It puts us in the driver's seat," said Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who has 
been a critic of the CRA but who disagreed sharply with Yaroslavsky's proposal 
to take over the agency. 
</P>
<P>
In one of few acrimonious moments during the council's debate Tuesday, Molina 
accused Yaroslavsky of supporting the kind of CRA projects, subsidized with 
property taxes, that have made the agency a target of social activists. Molina 
said one such project that Yaroslavsky voted for is "The Metropolitan," a 
$45-million luxury apartment complex that opened Tuesday in South Park on the 
edge of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said he could not recall how he voted on the project. But he said 
that questionable CRA projects often arrive before the council wrapped in a 
package of proposals, some good and some bad, which typically require an 
immediate vote. 
</P>
<P>
"You can throw the baby out with the bathwater, and cast a 'no' vote on 
everything the CRA sends over. You can walk away from tough choices and simply 
not vote like Gloria does. Or, you can vote on everything that comes before 
you, as I do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But the real problem," Yaroslavsky said, "is that the CRA has been so 
manipulative about the way they present information that you really must 
conclude that they have contempt for the council." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky argued that unless the council takes over the CRA it will not be 
able to control the agency. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky's Assessment 
</P>
<P>
"The issue is whether we are going to be accountable or whether we wish to 
continue the cozy relationship between the CRA and certain pockets of power in 
city government." 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky has been discussing the possibility of an initiative dealing with 
CRA policy to some of the community groups that have been most critical of the 
CRA. After the vote Tuesday, spokesmen for those groups expressed enthusiasm 
for an initiative. 
</P>
<P>
For Yaroslavsky, organizing such an initiative would offer a way back into 
citywide politics, which he temporarily abandoned when he suddenly dropped out 
of the mayoral race late last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely going to explore the possibility of an initiative," said 
Anthony Thigpenn, executive director of Los Angeles Jobs with Peace. "We don't 
think the council has done enough. By their actions today, they are saying they 
are content to review policy, not to make it. We think redevelopment policy 
should be in the hands of the people's elected representatives." 
</P>
<P>
But others said they were not yet sure whether Yaroslavsky would be able to 
lead an effective campaign after his withdrawal from the mayoral race. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apprehension Seen 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a bit of apprehension that without wider council support, Zev 
might be isolated," said a spokesman for one community organization who asked 
not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
Voting with Yaroslavsky to take over the CRA were John Ferraro, Ruth Galanter, 
Ernani Bernardi, Nate Holden and Marvin Braude. None of the five said anything 
about the initiative during the floor debate over the CRA, although Braude 
indicated he was receptive to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I am prepared to explore it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Working with Braude in the past, Yaroslavsky has been a leader in two 
successful citywide ballot initiatives: Proposition U, a 1986 measure to limit 
commercial development, and last year's drive to block a beachfront oil 
drilling project by Occidental Petroleum Corp. in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
An initiative designed around spending policies for the poor could give 
Yaroslavsky something he has lacked to date -- an issue that would unite 
Westside middle-class white liberals with blacks and Latinos from the city's 
south and east sides. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Need for Coalition Told 
</P>
<P>
"It would take a coalition of minorities and Westsiders that did not exist with 
Proposition U," Yaroslavsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky would not say whether he has done any polling to support an 
initiative but, clearly, he would be counting on a growing public perception 
that the city's leaders are not responding adequately to indications of a 
widening gap between rich and poor in this city.

DELEGATE TAKEN TO FBI OFFICE; 
</P>
<P>
SPYING ADMISSION STUNS CHINESE DISSIDENT GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH LU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A delegate to the convention of a dissident Chinese group in Monterey Park last 
week shocked his colleagues when he declared himself a spy who wants to sever 
ties with the Chinese government, spokesmen for the group said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Chinese Alliance for Democracy said they immediately contacted 
the FBI and drove the man, Shou Huaqiang, to the agency's West Covina office. 
They said that although Shou has telephoned leaders of the group since the 
weekend, they do not know his whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
FBI officials declined to comment. "We just don't address that sort of question 
for the media," said Fred Reagan, a spokesman for the Los Angeles branch of the 
FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Shou's emotional confession Friday afternoon at the alliance's fourth worldwide 
convention caused a stir during opening ceremonies, said Hu Ping, chairman of 
the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the alliance, formed seven years ago by overseas Chinese scholars, 
favor democratic reforms in China. The group, which claims 3,000 members 
worldwide, publishes China Spring, a Chinese-language magazine critical of the 
Communist government. 
</P>
<P>
Shou told the convention that his assignment was to infiltrate the alliance, 
disrupt its work and obtain evidence of a financial link between the alliance 
and the government of Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
Shou, believed to be in his 30s, moved to Missouri from Shanghai about two 
years ago to attend Washington University in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
No one is certain what Shou did in China, but alliance leaders said he soon 
began befriending dissident Chinese in this country. He called Hu, telling him 
he was friends with other alliance members and began writing for China Spring. 
</P>
<P>
"His articles are excellent," Hu said, adding that Shou used a different pen 
name each time. Last October, he sponsored Shou to become an alliance member. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the 110 convention delegates, from countries including the United 
States, France, Japan and Canada, said they were not surprised by Shou's 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
"If there weren't any (spies), then that would be strange," said Chris Wu, a 
Monterey Park engineer. 
</P>
<P>
Wu said Shou told him that he decided to publicly announce his activities as a 
spy "because of the June 4 massacre." Shou said the killings of pro-democracy 
protesters in Beijing that day left him shaken, Wu said. "He said he cried for 
several days. He was determined to change his life." 
</P>
<P>
Shou told alliance members that he had been reluctant to become a spy, said Liu 
Xinhua, president of the alliance's Los Angeles chapter. Shou said that in 
1986, shortly after he applied for permission to study in the United States, 
two National Security Department officials tried to recruit him, Liu said. 
</P>
<P>
"He felt he couldn't refuse," Liu said. "He said, 'If I refuse, then I can't go 
overseas.' " Not even Shou's wife knew of his work as a spy, said Bang-tai Xu, 
an alliance member from Albany, Calif. "He said after he told his wife, she 
cried for several days."

DEATH PENALTY DECREED FOR KILLER OF 4 WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An illiterate construction worker convicted of four murders, including two 
"Southside Slayer" killings of prostitutes in South-Central Los Angeles, was 
sentenced Tuesday to die in the gas chamber at San Quentin. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Craine, 32, stared ahead in glum silence as Compton Superior Court Judge 
Janice Claire Croft rejected a defense plea that would have allowed him to 
serve life in prison without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bodies Discarded 
</P>
<P>
Acting on the recommendation of a Superior Court jury that in May recommended 
capital punishment, Croft said that Craine's "victims fought frantically for 
their lives . . . and he manually strangled each of them to death and discarded 
their bodies in abandoned houses, vacant lots and an alley like so much trash." 
</P>
<P>
After the sentencing, defense attorney Morris B. Jones told reporters that he 
would appeal based on Croft's last-minute removal of the sole juror who had 
held out against the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Juror Carol Martin was removed from the 12-member panel after several fellow 
jurors reported to Croft at a court hearing that Martin was refusing to 
deliberate, was acting "spaced out" and had drunk a liter of wine at a 
restaurant during lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Before the hearing, jurors had informed Croft that they were hopelessly 
deadlocked, 11-1. After an alternate was appointed, the jury deliberated only 
four more hours before returning with a unanimous recommendation in favor of 
death. 
</P>
<P>
Martin, who did not testify at the hearing, has since sent Jones and Deputy 
Dist. Atty. John Watson a letter saying she was surprised that she was not 
given a chance to defend herself. She added that although she had voted to 
convict Craine, she was holding out against the death penalty because of her 
sympathy with his difficult childhood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Motion Dismissed 
</P>
<P>
Croft dismissed a defense motion Tuesday for a new trial, saying that Martin 
was removed because of evidence that "she wasn't deliberating." Jones countered 
that "argumentativeness is part of the deliberating process -- we don't want 
rubber stamps in here." 
</P>
<P>
As for the drinking allegations, the defense attorney added, "I've seen judges 
go to the the Sizzler (a restaurant next to the courthouse) and drink during 
the noon hours. . . . Everyone has a different tolerance." 
</P>
<P>
Watson, who prosecuted the case, praised Croft's sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
"These were vicious, vicious murders (and) the defendant has never shown any 
remorse at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Watson said Craine may also have been involved in several other attacks 
attributed to the so-called Southside Slayer. But he added that it is likely 
that at least four or five different criminals were responsible for the string 
of 18 murders. 
</P>
<P>
Charges against another suspect in three of the Slayer killings, former Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Rickey Ross, were dismissed last month after 
weapons tests linking Ross to the slayings were proven wrong. Two other men 
have also been arrested in connection with Southside Slayer killings. 
</P>
<P>
Craine was found guilty of first-degree murder in the strangling deaths of 
Loretta Perry, found dead in a vacant South Defiance Avenue house in January, 
1987; Gail M. Ficklin, found in an alley near South Grande Street in August, 
1985; Vivian Louise Collins, found in an abandoned house on East Century 
Boulevard in 1986, and Carolyn Barney, found in a vacant lot in May, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sexual Assault 
</P>
<P>
Craine, who was also convicted of three counts of sexual assault on the 
victims, was acquitted of a fifth slaying, the November, 1984, stabbing and 
strangulation of Sheila Rae Burris. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant, who has a sixth-grade education and an IQ of 69, left home while 
in his mid-teens and lived in downtown transient hotels and the caretaker's 
room of a coin laundry, where he served as an attendant. For the five months 
before his arrest, Craine, who has no previous felony convictions, had returned 
to live at his parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
The sentencing took place just one day after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that 
murderers who suffer mental retardation may be put to death. 
</P>
<P>
During Craine's trial, defense attorneys contended that his confession resulted 
from his low intelligence, which gave him the tendency to "parrot" the 
statements of others. 
</P>
<P>
Watson countered that "in the legal sense, there is no question of him being 
mentally competent." Craine, Watson said, was able to live on his own, hold 
down jobs and bear up under lengthy cross-examination in court.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INS SETS UP HOT LINE FOR CHINESE IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying they wanted Chinese students in this country "to know that we support 
the democracy these young people are protesting for," federal immigration 
officials in Los Angeles announced Tuesday that a toll-free hot line will begin 
operating today to aid Chinese nationals who want to remain in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"We suggest that they come forward to us if they have any questions or want to 
change their status," said Harold Ezell, the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service's western regional commissioner. "But if they don't, 
they will not be sent home." 
</P>
<P>
Operators fluent in Mandarin and Cantonese will man the hot line, which can be 
reached by dialing (800) 448-4994. Ezell estimated that 30,000 of the 80,000 
Chinese who are in the country on a temporary immigration status live in the 
Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Guidelines recently issued by U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh allow Chinese 
students or visitors who entered the country before June 6 to remain until June 
5, 1990. Those who wish to apply for permanent residency can seek political 
asylum, said INS Los Angeles District Director Ernest Gustafson.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EQUESTRIAN HURT IN FALL WINS $385,714 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Glendale woman, who fell while riding a horse on a Los Angeles City bridle 
trail and injured her leg, will be paid $385,714 in damages by the city because 
the Parks Department failed to property maintain the trail, the City Council 
agreed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Miriam Dow, 42, was riding her horse down an equestrian ramp along the Los 
Angeles River Basin on Dec. 5, 1985, when the horse slipped and fell on her 
leg, breaking her left femur bone. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of surgery Dow's leg was shortened nearly an inch. She now walks 
with a limp, suffers from chronic pain and is unable to walk long distances and 
play tennis or other sporting activities, according to a report by the city 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Last February, a Los Angeles Superior Court civil trial jury found that the Los 
Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks had maintained the river ramps in 
poor conditions by failing to properly pack the cement paths with dirt to 
prevent horses from slipping. The jury awarded Dow the $385,714, which was 
approved by the council Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
City parks officials said that a caution sign has been installed at the 
entrance to the trail, warning users to "proceed at their own risk."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SCHOOL BOARD GIVES TENTATIVE BUDGET OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After approving nearly $43 million in cuts, the Los Angeles Board of Education 
has approved a tentative $3.8-billion spending plan for 1989-90, which slightly 
exceeds this year's $3.5-billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
Among the largest cuts approved are a 5% reduction in central administration 
costs ($6.1 million), eliminating outside management consultants on school 
construction projects ($2.4 million) and trimming per-student allotments of 
lottery money ($3 million). 
</P>
<P>
The budget includes some new expenditures required by law, such as earthquake 
repairs ($1.2 million), handicapped access ($1 million) and replacement of 
underground fuel storage tanks ($1.4 million). Other programs may be considered 
later this week, but chief financial officer Robert Booker said that additional 
expenditures would require further reductions in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
The proposals for new spending include $6.5 million to implement a plan to end 
low achievement, $250,000 for dropout prevention, $192,458 to expand humanities 
education and $131,883 to give district employees first-aid training.

COUNTY SUPERVISORS TO INSTALL METAL DETECTORS, GLASS SHIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soon, attending a Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors meeting will be a 
little like catching a plane -- you'll have to pass through a metal detector 
first. 
</P>
<P>
Installation of a metal detector is part of a plan to beef up security in the 
board's cavernous hearing room, county officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Also planned is the installation of laminated glass above the railing that 
separates the five supervisors and county staff from the public. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Monteilh, the board's executive officer, said the measures grew out of a 
security review his office began a year and a half ago and were not related to 
any recent events. 
</P>
<P>
During a noisy demonstration that briefly disrupted a Board of Supervisors 
meeting last month, members of the militant AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power sat 
down on the floor and repeatedly shouted, "Stop AIDS!" About 15 protesters were 
arrested by two dozen sheriff's deputies who had been alerted before the 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time we have large gathering in the board room, it heightens concern for 
the supervisors' safety," Monteilh said. "There isn't any way to make sure that 
somebody doesn't have a firearm other than to make them come through a (metal) 
detector." 
</P>
<P>
The glass wall is intended to prevent a recurrence of a 1953 incident in which 
an irate citizen jumped the railing in the board's former quarters and punched 
then-Supervisor Raymond Darby in the face. Darby died later that day of a brain 
hemorrhage. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, a uniformed sheriff's deputy stands guard over supervisors' 
meetings. A sign posted at the entrance to the board room, which seats more 
than 700 people, advises visitors that they are subject to search. The security 
plan calls for stationing four more guards at entrances. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors won't be the first in California to require citizens to pass 
through metal detectors before participating in their government's business. 
Such a device was installed at San Francisco City Hall after Mayor George 
Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk were shot and killed by just-resigned 
Supervisor Dan White in 1978. Some court buildings in Los Angeles County also 
have metal detectors. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council once considered getting metal detectors for its 
elegant, wood-paneled chambers but rejected them as too restrictive, said Los 
Angeles Police Officer Anthony Radavich, one of the council's two 
sergeants-at-arms. 
</P>
<P>
Monteilh said he consulted the supervisors privately before proceeding with the 
security plan, which will cost about $50,000. The plan became public when a 
county official advised reporters Tuesday that they would soon have to begin 
wearing press credentials to gain access to the seats near the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Monteilh said additional security measures are planned but declined to say what 
they are.

PLAN TO BAR RESERVOIR COVERS WINS ASSEMBLY OK

<P>
Despite a warning that public health might be sacrificed so that well-to-do 
residents can enjoy scenic views, the Assembly on Tuesday passed legislation 
that could prevent Los Angeles from covering 10 reservoirs that store drinking 
water for the city. 
</P>
<P>
The bill was authored by Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), who plans to 
build a home with a commanding view of the Silver Lake Reservoir, one of five 
at which the Department of Water and Power is considering building filtration 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
Although that reservoir is not among the 10 that might be covered, Roos said he 
knows from years of living near the man-made lake that such reservoirs are a 
"focal point" for surrounding neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"People in neighborhoods have certain rights that must be considered when we as 
a government make decisions that ultimately impact the quality of their lives," 
Roos said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aesthetic Values 
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved on a 48-27 vote and sent to the Senate, would declare all 
public reservoirs in the state "public resources" and require that any change 
in them preserve the reservoirs' recreational, scenic and aesthetic values. 
</P>
<P>
The measure would prohibit the state Department of Health Services from 
ordering a reservoir covered or drained unless no "technically feasible" 
alternative could be found. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a modest attempt by Los Angeles neighborhood groups to bring a modicum 
of clear thinking to what has thus far been a purely technical decision by 
government bureaucrats," Roos said. 
</P>
<P>
But Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) said Roos' bill deserved 
"unanimous rejection." 
</P>
<P>
"Should the public health, the quality and safety of our drinking water, be 
jeopardized to enhance the views of a few wealthy homeowners?" McClintock asked 
colleagues. "This would place recreation and aesthetics ahead of the storage 
and delivery of water and ahead of the protection of the public health." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Animal Waste 
</P>
<P>
McClintock referred to statements by DWP officials, who said the covers and 
filtration plants are needed to keep trash, animal waste and cancer-causing 
chemicals out of the water supply. 
</P>
<P>
Neighborhood groups from Pacific Palisades to Elysian Park have formed a 
coalition to fight the plan. Residents near the reservoirs say the covers could 
ruin their views and attract vandals. The filtration plants, they say, could be 
ugly and noisy. 
</P>
<P>
"A neighborhood in its best form is a notion of community organization that 
transcends just a group of people who happen to live next to each other," Roos 
said. "There's something that binds them. What I am saying is that the binder 
in some of our Los Angeles communities is our reservoirs."

LAST 4 PLAINTIFFS OK SETTLEMENT IN PSA CRASH LIABILITY SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A trial to determine liability for the 1987 Pacific Southwest Airlines crash 
that killed 43 people near Paso Robles ended abruptly Tuesday when the case's 
remaining four plaintiffs agreed to drop negligence claims as part of an 
agreement that still allows them to sue for damages. 
</P>
<P>
Five other plaintiffs had settled earlier for undisclosed amounts of money that 
one attorney said ranged up to "several million dollars." So far, a total of 
between $20 million and $37 million in settlements has been paid out as a 
result of the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
As part of Tuesday's out-of-court settlement, the defendants -- PSA, USAir, the 
City of Los Angeles and Ogden Allied Security Co., which PSA paid to handle 
security at Los Angeles International Airport -- admitted no responsibility for 
the Dec. 9, 1987, crash. The jetliner plunged to earth after a disgruntled 
former USAir ticket agent, David A. Burke, smuggled a gun aboard Flight 1771 
and opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arguments Scheduled 
</P>
<P>
Opposing lawyers had been scheduled to begin closing arguments before Los 
Angeles Superior Court Judge Jack T. Ryburn in the three-week jury trial when 
the agreement was announced. 
</P>
<P>
"The settlement eliminates the uncertainty (of a jury verdict)," said Ronald H. 
Wecht, one of the plaintiffs' lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
In the trial, no one contested Burke's role. According to the FBI and other 
federal investigators, Burke, 35, who had been accused of theft and fired from 
his job by Raymond Thomson, walked into Thomson's office at the airport at 2 
p.m. on the day of the crash and asked for his job back. 
</P>
<P>
Thomson, 48, a station manager for USAir, the parent company that later 
acquired PSA, refused. Later that day, the two men separately left the office 
to catch Flight 1771 for San Francisco. Investigators concluded that once he 
was on board the British-built BAe-146 jet, Burke used the .44 magnum revolver 
he had smuggled onto the plane to shoot Thomson, the jet's cockpit crew and 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Burke's role, however, the jury was being asked to consider 
whether PSA and the other defendants were also liable for the crash. On that 
score, jurors seemed split after the settlement was announced. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no way that anyone could have stopped Burke," said juror Sergio 
Gutierrez, 24, of San Gabriel. "He was determined to get on that plane and 
shoot people." Added juror William Palm of Los Angeles: "I thought the airlines 
did all they could." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Airline's Vulnerability 
</P>
<P>
Other jurors said the airlines' inability to account for all of Burke's 
employee identification badges made them vulnerable to charges of negligence. 
"They didn't even know how many badges were out there," said Stephen Chaborski, 
22, of Pico Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
Burke's estate was not a defendant in the trial since its estimated value of 
$200,000 could not come close to covering the damages sought by the 35 lawsuits 
filed by the victims' families. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the families who sued settled before the jury trial began earlier this 
month. Nine families decided to go to trial, but five of them settled before 
today. Settlement of the last four was reached late Monday, said attorney 
Joseph T. Cook. 
</P>
<P>
Cook said that his clients, the family of PSA flight attendant Debra Vulysteke, 
32, wanted a jury trial for damages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Admit No Liability 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the out-of-court settlement, the insurance carrier for PSA, 
USAir and Ogden Allied will pay out the money even though the three defendants 
have admitted no liability, said defense attorney John L. Papageorge. 
</P>
<P>
The City of Los Angeles, which operates the airport, will pay no money as part 
of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Each side in the case claimed victory after the jurors were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
Wecht said that the trial showed "how bad it (airport security) was." He added 
that "the public needs to know how disasters happen so we can avoid them in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
But airline attorney George Manfredi contended that Burke, not airport 
security, was the sole cause of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no system in the world that could prevent some insider from 
perpetrating acts of violence," he said.

MATUSZAK DEATH IS ACCIDENTAL; 
</P>
<P>
CORONER REPORTS HE TOOK OVERDOSE OF A PAINKILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former Raider star John Matuszak died of an accidental overdose of Darvocet, a 
prescription painkiller, the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office reported 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's office reported it also found "a small amount of a cocaine 
metabolate" in Matuszak's blood. Department spokesman Bob Dambacher said it 
suggests that Matuszak "may have taken some cocaine within 24 hours of his 
death, or so." 
</P>
<P>
However, the coroner's report says that the cocaine had been ruled out by the 
medical staff as a factor in Matuszak's death. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, two other factors were determined to have contributed to Matuszak's 
death: an enlarged heart, and bronchial pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
Matuszak, 38, died June 17, shortly after arriving home from a trip to West 
Germany to promote his movie, "One Man Force." He was buried four days later in 
Oak Creek, Wis., his hometown. 
</P>
<P>
His parents, Marv and Audrey, released a statement in Los Angeles Tuesday, 
saying that in the future they will have "things to say about substance abuse 
and the scoundrels in the medical profession who recklessly dispense 
prescription drugs and the parasites in society who distribute illicit drugs 
from back alleys to fashionable condominiums." 
</P>
<P>
Did that mean that the Matuszaks believe that the painkiller was improperly 
prescribed? 
</P>
<P>
"The D.A.'s office would have to answer that question," said Kathy Pinckert, 
formerly Matuszak's publicist, who released the family's statement. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the L.A. County District Attorney's office said that no 
complaint has been filed in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The coroner's office knows the identity of the physician who prescribed the 
painkiller, Dambacher said, but will release it only if the family wishes. 
</P>
<P>
Matuszak suffered from chronic back pain, having injured it in his last Raider 
training camp in 1982. In addition, he admitted in his autobiography, "Cruisin' 
with the Tooz" that he had had alcohol and cocaine problems. 
</P>
<P>
As a Kansas City Chief in 1976, he wrote of collapsing in a bar after mixing 
Tuinal, a sleeping pill, with alcohol. He was taken to a hospital in an 
ambulance with Coach Paul Wiggin riding beside him, pounding his chest in an 
attempt to keep him alive. 
</P>
<P>
Matuszak wrote that he sought professional help in 1985, that he "fell off the 
wagon" in the summer of 1986 and sought more help that fall. In his book, 
published in 1987, he said he was no longer drinking at all and was "taking 
nothing, not even sleeping pills." 
</P>
<P>
There had been an assertion, by "One Man Force" producer-director Dale 
Trevillion and his wife, actress Sharon Ferrell, that Matuszak was upset at the 
lack of U.S. promotion of their movie. 
</P>
<P>
However, Pinckert said that Matuszak had dinner at her home the night before he 
left for West Germany and voiced no such complaint, that he was "in good 
spirits," and had plenty of work lined up for his return, including a project 
with Sylvester Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
"In memory of John Matuszak, we are not unmindful of the problems our son had 
in his battle against chronic pain and his resulting use of drugs, both 
prescription and otherwise," Marv and Audrey Matuszak's statement read. 
</P>
<P>
"At his funeral last week in his hometown, Oak Creek, Wis., and since our 
arrival in Los Angeles for his memorial service in Oakland, we have received 
hundreds of calls, cards and letters, celebrating the kind, wonderful and 
positive things he did in his all-too-short lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
"For now . . . we do not wish the dark side (of this matter) to detract from 
the celebration of the good and great deeds of this kind and wonderful man, our 
son."

THE NBA DRAFT; 
</P>
<P>
CLIPPERS TAKE PASS ON ELLIOTT AND PLAY IT SAFE WITH FERRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
To the guarded Clippers, in the wake of Danny Manning's severe knee injury, 
Sean Elliott's leg brace and much-publicized medical report, apparently posed 
too big a risk in Tuesday's National Basketball Assn. draft. 
</P>
<P>
So they took the safe route, selecting Duke forward-center Danny Ferry with the 
second pick in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
Elliott, the Wooden Award-winner from the University of Arizona, suffered a 
knee injury seven years ago and has worn the brace since, so the Clippers 
bypassed him. 
</P>
<P>
Needing an outside shooter, they were prepared to take Glen Rice of Michigan, 
touted as the draft's best shooter, but switched to Ferry, an inside player, at 
the last minute. Former Wolverine Gary Grant, the Clipper rookie point guard 
last season, even spent time before the draft trying to persuade General 
Manager Elgin Baylor to take Rice. 
</P>
<P>
Meetings among Baylor, President Alan Rothenberg, still-interim coach Don 
Casey, director of scouting Barry Hecker, team physician Tony Daly and owner 
Donald T. Sterling dominated the final hours before the draft. As late as 15 
minutes before the draft began, uncertainty prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Sterling excused himself from the meeting upstairs at the Sports Arena 
and took his seat on the floor to watch the selection process with everyone 
else on the two big-screen televisions, leaving the decision to Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
He surely hoped for a better reaction. When announcer Ralph Lawler took a note 
from Baylor and told about 2,000 fans on hand that Ferry was a Clipper, the 
Sports Arena echoed with boos. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there's some mixed emotions with the pick," Baylor said. "We just felt 
we had to get the best available player." 
</P>
<P>
With doubts about Elliott's longevity, the Clippers chose a player with 
basketball bloodlines. Ferry, a two-time Atlantic Coast Conference player of 
the year, is the son of Washington Bullet General Manager Bob Ferry. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little surprised, but I think I would have been surprised no matter 
where I ended up," Ferry said of the selection. "I had no idea where I would be 
playing next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking forward to getting the day over with (because of the 
uncertainty) that I didn't worry where I would go. I'll finally be able to 
sleep good tonight. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what to expect and kind of came into the draft thinking that 
way. Something may still happen." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, a trade. Baylor, as usual, refused to rule out any such 
possibilities, saying, "We don't shut the door to that." But, clearly, this was 
not a pick for trade bait. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of Ferry, a 6-foot-10 All-American, was based on depth more than 
immediate need. On a team that has Ken Norman, probably their most valuable 
player in 1988-89, and Charles Smith, selected to the league's all-rookie team, 
at forward, the Clippers took Ferry because: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He can play center, at least on offense. The Clippers are unsure whether he 
can handle the low post defensively, but could use him there, employing a small 
lineup such as the Golden State Warriors did last season, or as insurance to 
cover the unpredictable Benoit Benjamin. That includes the possibility that 
Benjamin will become an unrestricted free agent after next season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He can, at the least, be another backup forward to Smith and Norman with no 
return date targeted for Manning, and none expected for a couple of months. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say Ferry is dead smack in the middle as a player between myself and 
Danny Manning," said Smith, who played against Ferry in past Sports Festivals 
and the 1984 U.S. Olympic Trials. "He's a good passer around the post like 
Manning, and he can hit the outside shot and rebound." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers went for shooters in the second round, and also finished the draft 
three for three on player-of-the-year picks. 
</P>
<P>
At No. 31, they took Jeff Martin of Murray State, regarded as an outstanding 
outside shooter. The Ohio Valley Conference player of the year, who averaged 
25.6 points as a senior, is the brother of Wayne Martin, the former Arkansas 
defensive end who was the New Orleans Saints' first-round pick on April 23. 
</P>
<P>
Pick No. 33, acquired as part of the trade that sent Derek Smith to the 
Sacramento Kings in 1986, was a little more well-known: Jay Edwards of Indiana, 
the Big Ten player of the year in 1989 as a sophomore. He comes with potential 
and excess baggage to match, namely being suspended for two weeks during his 
freshman season for academic reasons and then spending 10 days in an 
Indianapolis substance-abuse center for an undisclosed problem last September. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not concerned about it," Baylor said. "It seems like everything is 
behind him." 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers hope so. Edwards or Martin may be their starting off guard, if 
Reggie Williams does not come around and Quintin Dailey, a free agent as of 
July 1, is not re-signed. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Elgin Baylor, discussing Sean Elliott and his knee problems, said last week: 
"The guy has played for seven years with no problem, not even swelling. He went 
through the Olympic trials with two-a-day workouts with no problem. We don't 
see any of that (the knee) being a problem." Tuesday, Baylor said: "Talking to 
our medical people, we thought there might be a risk factor." . . . So much for 
bringing players into town for individual workouts, as most teams do. The 
Clippers had visits from Elliott, Glen Rice, Pervis Ellison and George McCloud. 
No Danny Ferry. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers again are using Danny Manning to promote ticket sales without any 
certainty that he will play. Last season, they put the No. 1 draft pick in 
advertisements and on the cover of the media guide before he even signed, 
causing something of an interesting campaign when Manning held out. Now, 
Manning, along with Ken Norman, Gary Grant and Charles Smith, has been in 
newspaper promotions advertising season tickets. . . . Don Casey was introduced 
as Coach Don Casey to the crowd, whatever that means. Casey, the Clippers' 
interim coach since Jan. 19, has not been approached by team officials about a 
future contract after his runs out July 1.

TUDOR HAS DODGER BRASS SMILING; 
</P>
<P>
ALLOWS 2 RUNS, 5 HITS IN 4 1/3 INNINGS; TEAMS TIED, 3-3, IN 15

He didn't make it through the fifth inning. He didn't get a victory. He gave up 
five hits and two runs and then left the game with one out and two runners on. 
</P>
<P>
But in a box on the club level behind home plate, Dodger Vice President Fred 
Claire was smiling. Next to him, Dodger team doctor Frank Jobe was smiling. 
</P>
<P>
And later Tuesday night, maybe when no one was looking too close, maybe even 
John Tudor was smiling. Not like a star, but like a survivor, which for now 
must be good enough. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching for the first time since walking off the mound in pain in Game 3 of 
the 1988 World Series, Tudor didn't allow a hit to the first 12 San Diego 
Padres batters before running out of gas. He eventually surrendered two runs on 
five hits in 4 1/3 innings in a game that was tied, 3-3, in the 15th inning. 
</P>
<P>
After the Padres had taken a 3-2 lead on Tim Flannery's pinch RBI single in the 
top of the 13th, John Shelby got things starter against new Padre pitcher Mark 
Grant in the bottom of the inning with a single up the middle. Jeff Hamilton 
bunted Shelby to second, and Jose Gonzalez walked. Pat Clements relieved Grant 
and promptly threw a wild pitch that moved the runners to second and third. 
From there, all it took was a broken bat grounder by pinch-hitter Mike Davis to 
score Shelby with the tying run. Anderson walked and took second uncontested. 
The inning ended, however, when Alfredo Griffin grounded to second with runners 
on second and third.. It was all so typical. After Tudor left, the game became 
a match of lost wits. 
</P>
<P>
In the five innings after Tudor, Dodger relievers Alejandro Pena, Jay Howell 
and John Wetteland combined to strike out 11 of the 17 Padres hitters they 
faced. Pena struck out two in the sixth and struck out the side in the seventh. 
Howell struck out three in two innings of work, and then Wetteland struck out 
the side in the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres actually had a threat in the 11th, when they put runners on second 
and third with two out after Wetteland had advanced them by throwing a pitch so 
wild, it bounced off the ground and then off catcher Rick Dempsey's mask and 
ended up back near the mound. But Wetteland exonerated himself and ended the 
inning by getting Mark Parent into a flyout. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, after the Dodgers had tied the game with a run in the sixth and 
seventh on RBI singles by Mickey Hatcher and Alfredo Griffin, they also messed 
up offensively. They had runners on first and third with two out in the ninth 
and could have won it, but Rick Dempsey hit a line drive directly at third 
baseman Luis Salazar for the third out. 
</P>
<P>
Then they put two runners on base against reliever Greg Harris in the 11th, 
only to have 19-save man Mark Davis enter the game and get Alfredo Griffin on a 
flyout to left to end it. 
</P>
<P>
Claire was pleased with Tudor's effort. 
</P>
<P>
"He pitched very well, I'm pleased with what I saw," Claire said of the pitcher 
who was just eight months removed from extensive shoulder and elbow surgery. 
"We'll see how he responds to this, and go from there." 
</P>
<P>
When Claire was asked if he was surprised by Tudor's good outing, his smile 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
"No, it's not unbelievable," Claire said. "That's what John is all about. 
That's what he asks of himself. That's what he expects." 
</P>
<P>
Added Dr. Jobe: "Usually something like this takes at least a year. I'm very 
happy. John has worked very hard." 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 2-0 after Tudor had thrown 72 pitches and departed, the Dodger offense 
took it from there. Against Bruce Hurst, who brought a 19 consecutive scoreless 
inning streak into the game, they scored one in the sixth and another in the 
seventh to tie it. 
</P>
<P>
In the sixth, Willie Randolph led off with a single but was forced at second on 
a Gibson grounder. Eddie Murray's bouncer to first baseman Jack Clark moved 
Gibson to second, where he scored on Mickey Hatcher's single to right. That hit 
was Hatcher's sixth in his last 12 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Another hot hitter delivered for the Dodgers in the seventh, after Gonzalez 
started things by beating out an grounder to second base by sliding into first. 
</P>
<P>
After Gonzalez's leadoff hit, Mike Scioscia bunted him to second. Pinch-hitter 
Dave Anderson then struck out, something pinch-hitter Mariano Duncan had done 
two innings earlier with Dodgers on first and second. 
</P>
<P>
But with two out, up stepped Griffin, who entered the game with 31 hits in his 
last 85 at-bats (.365) to improve his average to a season-high .272. And he 
didn't disappoint. He lined a one-strike Hurst pitch into left field for a 
single that scored Gonzalez with the tying run, with Griffin taking second on 
Chris James' weak throw to the plate. Randolph then drew a walk, setting up 
Gibson for some now-expected heroics. 
</P>
<P>
But it just doesn't happen every time. Gibson swung at Hurst's first pitch and 
hit hit hard, but high, and center-fielder Shawn Abner was able to find it 
about 300 feet from home plate to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
By then Tudor was long gone, but certainly not forgotten. Not after the way 
this game started. It had started so easy. It was too easy. A man just doesn't 
let some doctor reconstruct his pitching arm and then eight months later wrap 
that arm around the bats of big league hitters. 
</P>
<P>
Yet that is what the first four innings were like. Tudor's first pitch, to 
leadoff hitter Bip Roberts, was a strike. So was his second pitch. Two foul 
balls later, Roberts grounded outs, all strikes. Two pitches later Roberto 
Alomar hit a weak grounder to shortstop. Four pitches later Tony Gwynn struck 
out for just the 15th time this season. Eleven pitches, three outs. 
</P>
<P>
In the second inning he retired the first two Padres just as quickly, with 
Clark striking out and James flying to center. After Tudor walked Garry 
Templeton, he retired Mark Parent on a grounder to shortstop to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Then came Tudor's third, and it didn't last long. Abner popped to first base, 
Hurst struck out, and Roberts grounded to second. It seemed just as easy in the 
beginning of the fourth, as Alomar flied to right and Gwynn grounded to first. 
But then Tudor allowed back- to-back singles to Clark and James and the first 
signs of tiring were there. He finished the inning by getting Templeton on a 
fly-ball out, but it was never again so easy. 
</P>
<P>
Parent led off the Padre fifth with a single to left. Abner did the same. Hurst 
bunted the runners over. Then, on a 3-and-1 pitch, Tudor walked Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
With Ricky Horton warming up, it appeared the next batter, Alomar, was going to 
be Tudor's last. And so he was, as he punched Tudor's first pitch into right 
field to score two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
A day after being demoted to Albuquerque despite a 2.73 ERA in 33 innings, 
pitcher Tim Crews said he would asked to be traded if another trade can't be 
worked that will return him to the big leagues within 20 days, thus not denying 
him a full year of major league service. Crews, who was sent down to make room 
for John Tudor, said Tuesday that he was upset at being sent out simply because 
the team has too many pitchers. He was taken off the Dodgers' postseason roster 
last season for the same reason, when the club decided to go from 10 to 9 
pitchers. "It bothers me that it always seems like I'm the guy who gets picked 
on," Crews said, noting he was going to speak today with Fred Claire, Dodger 
vice president for player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Marshall took his first batting practice Tuesday since going on the 
disabled list May 31 with a weak lower back. The effect of the swings on his 
back will not be known until today, but Marshall said he hopes for some form of 
action by next week's beginning of a six-game trip, the final series of games 
before the All-Star break. That action could be in the form of a minor league 
rehabilitation assignment, as Marshall admitted it would take four or five days 
to begin feeling comfortable. But he said mentally, he's ready now. "It's 
important for me to get back in the lineup, and have me penciled in at right 
field every day -- with so many different lineups, it's hard for us to win," 
Marshall said. "I've been doing everything I can, it's important time for me, I 
don't want to miss any more games than I have to." A Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
test was performed on Marshall and some wear was found on a lower disk, but it 
was nothing Marshall can't work through. "We're strengthening all the muscles 
around the back to help it," said Pat Screnar, team therapist.

PADRES, DODGERS PROVING NOTHING; 
</P>
<P>
THEIR OFFENSES SPUTTER TO A 2-2 TIE THROUGH 12 INNINGS 
</P>

Padres vs. the Dodgers at Chavez Ravine. Not so long ago, the stars would come 
out at night for this series. Fans would debate Garvey vs. Guerrero at first, 
Nettles vs. Madlock at third, Williams vs. Lasorda in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
No more. It's two weeks before the All-Star break, and instead of a glamorous 
showdown of No. 1 contender meeting the defending world champion on its home 
turf for the first time, it has turned into a barroom scrap of two teams 
staggering to stave off elimination. Tuesday night, they staggered into the 
13th inning tied, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
And you can be assured that no one was debating the relative merits of Bip 
Roberts vs. Jeff Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
"Hell, who thought it'd turn out like this?" Padres Manager Jack McKeon said. 
And that was beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
The game was a microcosm of why the the crowd of 37,385 was watching the two 
worst run-scoring offenses in the land. 
</P>
<P>
There were 26 strikeouts, 15 by the Padre offense, through the first 11 1/2 
innings of their 2-2 game. 
</P>
<P>
There were two extra-base hits. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, there were the Padres, who stole this show of offensive 
ineptitude. After scoring two runs in the fifth on Roberto Alomar's two-run 
single, the Padres' next hit did not come until 17 batters later, when Luis 
Salazar doubled with two out in the 10th. That was only the second ball hit by 
the Padres that even went out of the infield during that stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Really, there's no need to look further than the first baseman of each team -- 
Jack Clark of the Padres, Eddie Murray of the Dodgers -- to find the roots of 
these teams' offensive woes. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, escaping the wrath of New York, and Murray, fleeing the impoverished 
land of the Orioles, were supposed to be resurrecting their baseball talents, 
remember? Clark was going to have an MVP-type season, the Padres told everyone, 
and if you didn't believe them, you could watch 'em all on TV in late October. 
The Dodgers had a sneaky suspicion the Padres might be right, so they rescued 
Murray from Baltimore and told the Padres that they'd have to get by them 
first. 
</P>
<P>
Funny how this game works. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who entered the night hitting .213 with nine homers and 39 RBIs -- oh 
yeah, and 85 strikeouts -- struck out three more times and had two singles and 
a walk, which led to Flannery's run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, hitting .236 with seven homers and 41 RBIs coming in, went one for six 
with three strikeouts and a broken-bat double. 
</P>
<P>
Who would have imagined that a fellow by the name of Mickey Tettleton would 
have four more homers than Clark and Murray combined? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what you call it, a slump or whatever," Clark said, "but it's 
like a nightmare that won't go away. If we were in first place, maybe you could 
have a little more patience. You could tell the guys, 'Thanks for holding me 
up, I'll be there for you in the second half.' 
</P>
<P>
"But this? This? I don't know how to deal with it. Last year was my toughest 
year in baseball, but I could deal with it. This, I have no idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm fighting myself every day. I don't know whether my swing will come back 
now, or whether I'll be totally screwed up for the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got pride, lots of pride. But I have a real hard time finding it 
warranted for me to get a paycheck. I have a real hard time finding it 
warranted for me to be in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep thinking I'll come around, hoping that I'm just around the corner. But 
to tell you the truth, I don't even feel close. Sometimes, I feel like I don't 
even know what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
His teammates must have had the same kind of feeling Tuesday, with just five of 
their outs reaching the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
They were up to their usual tricks again, managing to hit just one ball out of 
the infield in the first three innings and blowing a scoring opportunity in the 
fourth when Garry Templeton flied out with two runners on. 
</P>
<P>
Remember now, this production was coming off someone who had not pitched in a 
big-league game since the third game of the World Series on Oct. 18 and who had 
reconstructive surgery on his left elbow nine days later. 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, the Dodgers' John Tudor began to tire in the fifth, and the 
Padres finally took advantage. They opened the inning with consecutive singles 
by Mark Parent and Shawn Abner, moved into scoring position on a sacrifice bunt 
by Bruce Hurst and loaded the bases on Bip Roberts' walk. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Alomar, the man who drew McKeon's wrath Saturday night when he failed 
to cover first on a bunt and was threatened with an all-expenses trip to Las 
Vegas, appeared to pull another boner when he swung at the first pitch instead 
of waiting to see if Tudor could solve his control problems. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't realize it, but there's a lot of luck in this game, too," McKeon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever, it paid off for Alomar as he slapped a single to right, scoring 
Parent and Abner. Ricky Horton relieved Tudor after he had thrown 69 pitches 
and promptly induced Tony Gwynn to ground into a double play, ending their 
offensive bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers came right back in the fifth inning with three singles, and with 
one out, all that stood between a tie game was a single to the outfield by 
Mario Duncan, who was batting a cool .500 (seven for 14) with three RBIs as a 
pinch-hitter this season. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst struck him out on three pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Next up was Mario Duncan. Three pitches later, he hit a chopper to Clark, who 
bobbled the ball, but recovered in time to toss it to Hurst covering the bag. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst, though, was unable to escape unscathed in the sixth and seventh innings 
when he gave up leadoff singles, each coming back to haunt him. Mickey Hatcher 
drove in Kirk Gibson for the first run in the sixth, and Alfredo Griffin tied 
the game in the seventh by driving in Jose Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
Hurst pitched a one-two-three eighth inning and foiled a Dodger rally in the 
ninth but was left with the only satisfaction of not being the losing pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
Padre Notes 
</P>
<P>
Padre Manager Jack McKeon benched catcher Benito Santiago for the second 
consecutive game Tuesday, starting Mark Parent instead. "Benny won't like it," 
McKeon said, "but that's tough. It's not a one-man team. He's still going to 
catch his 125 games. He (Parent) caught a good game Sunday, the team played 
inspired, we won, so I'll stay that way. Who knows, maybe I'll start him again 
tomorrow, too?" . . . Parent, who has started consecutive games on just one 
other occasion this season (four in a row from May 6-May 10) simply shrugged 
his shoulders and said, "Hmm, Benny must be in the doghouse again." . . . 
Santiago, who recognizes that Parent's two-run homer Sunday surely must have 
had something to do with him being on the bench, said: "I'm getting used to it 
by now." . . . McKeon and Cardinals Manager Whitey Herzog have been chosen by 
the National League as coaches in the 1989 All-Star game, joining Dodger 
Manager Tommy Lasorda and his staff. . . . The Gwynn brothers, Tony of the 
Padres and Chris of the Dodgers, exchanged the lineup cards at home. . . . The 
Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds are discussing a trade that would send pitcher Tim 
Leary to the Reds for outfielder Kal Daniels. Daniels is hitting .231 with one 
homer and six RBIs in 29 games after undergoing arthroscopic surgery this year; 
Leary is 6-5 with a 3.12 ERA. . . . Dodger General Manager Fred Claire has 
never made a trade with an NL West team, but Cook already has made three, 
sending Dennis Rasmussen to the Padres, Buddy Bell to Houston and Jeff Treadway 
to Atlanta. . . . Padre third baseman Bip Roberts failed for the first time in 
three starts, and just the fourth time in his past 12 starts, to lead off the 
game with a hit, grounding to shortstop. . . . Alfredo Griffin was in the 
Dodger lineup as the leadoff hitter for the first time since Sept. 26, 1988. . 
. . Dodger outfielder Mike Marshall, on the 21-day disabled list with lower 
back problems, took batting practice for the first time since May 31. He said 
that he expects to be playing again within a week. . . . The second game of the 
three-game series is scheduled at 7:35 tonight with Ed Whitson (9-5) and Mike 
Morgan (5-6) as the probable starters. Dennis Rasmussen (2-5) is scheduled 
Thursday against Fernando Valenzuela (4-5) who has won four consecutive starts 
after being winless for 51 weeks.

WIMBLEDON ROUNDUP;

GRAF STORMS PAST SALMON IN THE FIRST ROUND, 6-1, 6-2

The key to beating Steffi Graf? Wait until she's sick, apparently. 
</P>
<P>
Graf obliterated her first-round opponent, Julie Salmon of England, 6-1, 6-2, 
and said afterward that she felt fine. 
</P>
<P>
"I am perfect," Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
As she improved her record to 194-7 since becoming No. 1 in 1987, Graf was 
playing her first match since she played in a weakened condition and lost the 
French Open final to Arantxa Sanchez of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
On that day in Paris, Graf was recovering from a virus and feeling sick, but 
that wasn't so unusual. In four of her last five losses, Graf was sick, with 
one thing or another. 
</P>
<P>
"I am easy to get something, I guess," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Graf said she is taking more vitamins now, but isn't sure if it's going to 
help.

"I'm just someone who gets colds and everything real easy. There is nothing I 
can do." 
</P>
<P>
It was business as usual for the other top women in the first round. Martina 
Navratilova, seeded second, defeated Jill Hetherington of Canada, 6-3, 6-2; 
Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina, seeded third, defeated Diane Balestrat of 
Australia, 6-1, 6-0, and Chris Evert, seeded fourth, defeated Peanut Harper, 
6-1, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova scored her 49th victory in her last 50 Wimbledon matches with 
relative ease, but she did not notice any intimidation factor working in her 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
"I was too busy worrying about me," she said. "I suppose if she fell down with 
her knees knocking, I would get an idea, but that didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tim Mayotte of Bradenton, Fla., seeded eighth, won his first-round match 
against Paolo Cane of Italy, 7-6 (7-2), 6-0, 6-1. It was Mayotte's 30th 
Wimbledon victory and made him the fourth-winningest active male player at 
Wimbledon behind Jimmy Connors, who has won 81; John McEnroe, 47, and Ivan 
Lendl, 33. . . . Monica Seles, 15, the Yugoslavia-born and Florida-bred 
sensation, has entered the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles, which will be played 
Aug. 7-13. 
</P>
<P>
Eleventh-seeded Brad Gilbert of Piedmont, Calif., is the only seeded player yet 
to complete his first-round match. Gilbert was tied at two sets all against 
John Fitzgerald of Australia when play was suspended because of darkness. . . . 
From 32-year-old Martina Navratilova: "I read that some of the players said 
they thought I would get more nervous playing the younger players. That's funny 
because the only one older is Chris (Evert)."

NEWSWIRE: TWO REPORTS SAY USE OF STEROIDS WIDESPREAD IN EAST GERMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two former athletes, one a world champion ski jumper, have charged that East 
Germany customarily gives young athletes steroids, two newspapers reported in 
Hamburg, West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The reports said that all top East German sports stars are required to use the 
drugs and that such successful athletes as figure skater Katerina Witt, 
sprinter Renate Stecher and swimmer Kristin Otto are among those who have 
regularly used anabolic steroids. 
</P>
<P>
"Every athlete who competes internationally for East Germany is doped, every 
one," said Hans-Juergen Noczenski, former head of the East German Judo Assn. 
Noczenski fled East Germany last February and now lives in Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Hans-Georg Aschenbach, the former East German ski jumping star, was quoted as 
saying that he was told to take steroids during his athletic career and that it 
is required among all top East German athletes. 
</P>
<P>
"I swallowed and injected anabolics for eight years," Aschenbach, 38, was 
quoted as saying. "We had to take this medicine. We were required to. Whoever 
didn't was forced out of the national squad and faced great difficulties in 
private life." 
</P>
<P>
Aschenbach fled East Germany last year and now works as a doctor specializing 
in athlete treatment in the West German city of Freiburg. 
</P>
<P>
East German sports officials, Aschenbach said, give steroid pills to promising 
athletes as young as 13 without telling them what the pills contain. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one reason I fled," he was quoted as saying.

DIRECTOR DEFENDS DFG RECORD OF MANAGEMENT AT COMMISSION HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Director Pete Bontadelli's Dept. of Fish and Game sailed through a six-hour 
hearing before the Little Hoover Commission Tuesday, but the Fish and Game 
Commission seemed to be in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
The Little Hoover Commission, which is investigating how well California's 
natural resources are managed, was far more impressed by Bontadelli than it was 
with FGC President Bob Bryant, whose group oversees the DFG. 
</P>
<P>
This was the second of two hearings; the first was last May in Los Angeles. 
Representatives of developers, conservationists and sports enthusiasts 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
After the testimony, at least one Hoover commissioner questioned whether the 
Fish and Game Commission was needed. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure," said commissioner Albert Gersten of Los Angeles, after a tough 
grilling of Bryant. "That commission is totally subservient to this department. 
</P>
<P>
"You say to yourself, if I can save $429,000 (the commission's annual budget) 
by not having a commission, maybe I'm better off having more manpower in this 
department." 
</P>
<P>
However, when the Hoover commission releases its conclusions and 
recommendations to the California legislature in the next three to six months, 
it probably will suggest restructuring, not abolishing, the commission, which 
commissioners characterized as little more than a "rubber stamp" for the DFG. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't mind if they worked harder," Gersten said. "Clearly, this (Bryant) 
is a fine man that came up. But the equation I get from the commission is that 
they're as close to a rubber stamp as they can get." 
</P>
<P>
When there is a conflict in policy, Gersten added, "They say, 'We'll work it 
out.' Sure, the commission will cave in every time." 
</P>
<P>
The Fish and Game Commission is a group of five citizens appointed by the 
governor to alternating six-year terms for the purpose of setting policy, which 
the department administers. The Hoover panel seemed to be left with the 
impression that the FGC does little more than issue hunting and fishing 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant, 60, a farmer from Yuba City, Calif., argued that his commission was 
effective, but he was not as convincing in defending his group as Bontadelli 
was in defending the DFG. 
</P>
<P>
Bontadelli, 41, is a glib administrator who has been a legislative aide or DFG 
deputy for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
During his testimony, Bryant, sat next to Harold Cribbs, the FGC's executive 
secretary, who often prompted Bryant's replies by whispering in his ear -- or 
simply answered for him. 
</P>
<P>
Once, Gersten said to Cribbs, "Would you like to answer? I see you whispering. 
I wouldn't mind Mr. Bryant answering these questions. He's the witness." 
</P>
<P>
Doris Allen (R-Cypress), a state assemblywoman who has been an adversary of the 
DFG for five years, said later, "Mr. Bryant looked intimidated to me. He really 
didn't respond well. It's too bad, because he does know (the subject)." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant testified: "(In) almost every decision made by the commission, some 
member has gone out (in the field) to see what's going on. We don't take the 
word of the department all the time. We keep asking questions until we get good 
answers." 
</P>
<P>
Cribbs: "The commission is not a rubber stamp for the department." 
</P>
<P>
Gersten said: "I find it distressing to have the president of the commission 
come up here and defer everything to the executive secretary." 
</P>
<P>
Bryant: "Well, Mr. Cribbs deals with it every day." 
</P>
<P>
Gersten: "Maybe you should." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Spotts of the Defenders of Wildlife, said that by proposing a mountain 
lion hunt two years ago, the commission demonstrated "it was out of step with 
the feeling of most Californians." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Peter Moyle, a professor of fisheries at UC Davis, said of the FGC: "As a 
policy-making body, it's way behind the times." 
</P>
<P>
However, they and other witnesses -- Mickey Bernstein of the California 
Wildlife Federation, Jim Crenshaw, representing the United Anglers of 
California, and W.F. Grader of the Pacific Coast Federation of (commercial) 
Fishermen's Associations, Inc. -- agreed that the department was doing a 
satisfactory job, considering its limited funds and personnel and political 
constraints. 
</P>
<P>
Bontadelli testified for two hours. 
</P>
<P>
"Our employees, if they err," he said, "tend to err on the side of protecting 
the environment. . . . hunting and fishing license sales are decreasing at a 
time when our problems are increasing." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Bontadelli said: "We function as a staff to the commission." 
</P>
<P>
Gersten responded: "We keep going round and round about who's in charge." 
</P>
<P>
Bontadelli also fended off a conflict-of-interest charge by the Waterfowlers 
Against Baiting organization that DFG officials had been guests at one of the 
controversial hunting clubs. 
</P>
<P>
Hoover Commissioner Barbara Stone told Bontadelli: "At the end of the day, I'm 
so sympathetic toward the department that I can't understand why anyone would 
be so stupid as to become director." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone laughed. Bontadelli smiled. 
</P>
<P>
Bontadelli said afterward: "We do the best we can with what we've got, and I 
personally believe the commission also tries to do its best." 
</P>
<P>
Gersten: "I do think that Mr. Bontadelli is doing his best. I'm not sure I 
would say the same thing about the commission."

WEEKEND POLL: 55% SAY ROSE BET ON BASEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A nationwide poll released Tuesday shows that 55% of 1,053 people questioned 
believe that Manager Pete Rose of the Cincinnati Reds is guilty of having bet 
on baseball, 14% believe he is not guilty and 30% said they don't know. 
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted by the Issues and Answers network, a national 
market-research survey company, over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The poll shows that 42% believe he bet on the Reds, 21% believe he did not and 
27% said they don't know or did not answer. Of those who answered yes or no, 
67% said yes, he bet on the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
If Rose is found guilty of betting on the Reds, 76% believe he should be 
suspended from baseball, with 38% saying he should be suspended for life and 
38% saying he should be suspended for less than life. 
</P>
<P>
If he is found guilty of betting on baseball games other than those involving 
the Reds, 56% believe he should be suspended -- 31% saying for one year.

EXCERPTS OF ROSE'S DEPOSITION APRIL 20-21 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Excerpts of Pete Rose's deposition on April 20-21 under questioning by baseball 
investigator John Dowd: 
</P>
<P>
On Thomas P. Gioiosa, guns and cocaine 
</P>
<P>
Rose was asked if he ever knew whether Gioiosa was carrying a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Rose: I never seen him with a pistol or anything. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: Were you aware that he was carrying cocaine from Florida? 
</P>
<P>
Rose: No, I wasn't aware of that. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: to Ohio? 
</P>
<P>
Rose: I heard rumors about that and I tried to put two and two together. And I 
can't honestly look you in the eye and say anything negative about (Paul) 
Janszen, (Donald) Stenger, (Michael) Fry, Gioiosa, with cocaine. I mean I never 
saw it around me. 
</P>
<P>
On betting baseball: 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: On baseball, Pete, did anybody in association with you bet on baseball or 
talk about betting on baseball in 1984 to 1988? 
</P>
<P>
Rose: I don't know what you mean talk about betting on baseball. No one bet 
baseball around me. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: That's what I want to know. Did anybody discuss . . . 
</P>
<P>
Rose: I don't understand what you mean talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: Discuss it. Did they say, "Hey Pete," you know, "should I bet on the Reds 
today?" 
</P>
<P>
Rose: No . . . 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: "Should I bet on the Dodgers?" "Should I bet on the Yanks?" "What do they 
look like?" "Who's pitching?" 
</P>
<P>
Rose: No. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: Any . . . ever any discussion like that? 
</P>
<P>
Rose: No. No way. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: Anybody ever ask you for advice or direction as to how they ought to 
place bets on professional major league baseball? 
</P>
<P>
Rose: No. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: And I take it you didn't offer it? You never volunteered it to anybody? 
</P>
<P>
Rose: I wouldn't know how to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: But you didn't do it? 
</P>
<P>
Rose: Did not do it. I did not do it. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: Right, 1984 to 1988, you never did it? 
</P>
<P>
Rose: No, I never did it ever. 1974. 1964. Never. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: Fine. 
</P>
<P>
Rose: Not just '84 to '88. . . . That's why I was sort of surprised to read the 
statements by Mike Fry in the Sports Illustrated. Or where in the hell he got 
those statements at. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: And what statements were those, Pete? 
</P>
<P>
Rose: That I . . . he quoted me as saying, well I like to bet on the Reds and I 
like to bet on baseball. This would be a good day to bet. That's a bunch of 
(expletive). 
</P>
<P>
On Janszen and drugs: 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: I take it you never had a conversation with him (Paul Janszen) about 
drugs? 
</P>
<P>
Rose: No. No. So I think that's why he probably started hanging with me so 
close. . . . It kind of seems to me that those fellows were all trying to link 
gambling to me because they were all in trouble with drugs. . . . Blackmail. He 
said he was going to tell the commissioner I bet on baseball. He was going to 
kill my wife. He was going to cripple my kids. . . . And I knew for a fact when 
I went to spring training this year that he was going to go to the 
commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
On Reds owner Marge Schott: 
</P>
<P>
Rose: Well, first of all, when I got 4,192, Marge Schott made it appear that 
she gave me a Corvette. But she didn't give me the Corvette. General Motors 
gave me the Corvette. If Marge would have gave it to me, I probably wouldn't 
have sold it. 
</P>
<P>
Dowd: Why is that? 
</P>
<P>
Rose: Because she's the owner of the ballclub. She made it appear . . . you 
don't know Marge Schott like we know Marge Schott. I mean she made it appear 
that she gave it to me, the way she handled it.

WITH TOYS FOR INFANTS, A TREND IS PLAIN TO SEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the world of infants, black and white is hot. Pastels are a bore. 
</P>
<P>
Yuppie parents are reconsidering buying their infants tan teddy bears and pink 
bunnies. Instead, they're snapping up pandas, zebras or any other 
black-and-white toy in sight. 
</P>
<P>
Today some newborns can't blink without seeing mobiles, diaper bags, strollers, 
bottles, quilts and stuffed animals -- all decorated in black and white. 
</P>
<P>
"It's . . . the hip baby toys," said Tiffany Pilato of Joys and Toys on Melrose 
Avenue. "Everybody that I've ever seen loves them, especially in Los Angeles. 
Everybody loves black and white." 
</P>
<P>
It all began innocently enough in the 1950s when Robert L. Fantz, a 
psychologist at Case Western Reserve University, discovered that infants in 
their first few months preferred looking at high-contrast images in black and 
white. Follow-up studies by numerous university researchers, including Susan 
Ludington-Hoe, associate professor of maternal child nursing at UCLA, also have 
shown that babies can't begin appreciating other colors until they are 6 to 9 
months old. 
</P>
<P>
"Newborn infants are fascinated by black-and-white contrast, not by all those 
lovely little pictures of Donald Duck and Jack and Jill going up the hill," 
Ludington-Hoe wrote several years ago in a professional journal widely 
circulated among nurses. 
</P>
<P>
But the news never traveled far. For years, true believers mostly were confined 
to childbirth educators and nurses in maternity wards, who would draw black 
designs on white paper and tape them to cribs of newborns and incubators of 
premature infants. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently no one apparently bothered to explore whether this inside secret 
could be mass-marketed. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the black-and-white toys on the market today can be traced to two women 
who got started in the business by slowly chipping away at parents' 
considerable skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Vincent, a neonatal nurse at Georgetown University Hospital in 
Washington, founded TOT, or Turn on Toys, four years ago after sewing stuffed 
zebras for her friends' newborns. 
</P>
<P>
Today, her company produces a milk bottle decorated with Holstein cows, plastic 
graphic cards, a menagerie of small stuffed animals and a toy checkered cab -- 
a big seller in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Wimmer, formerly director of therapeutic recreation at Children's Hospital 
in Denver, got her start six years ago when she began making black-and-white 
toys for her first child while pregnant. Her daughter loved them. "I thought 
either this is just my baby or there is something to it," she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
When other infants gurgled and cooed at the homemade toys, she switched 
careers. The company she founded with her husband now has mobiles hanging in 
1,000 hospitals scattered across the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Ann Klafter, a computer programmer, had read about the 
black-and-white theories. She then experimented with many types of infant 
stimulation on her daughter, including black and white. She draped a 
black-and-white shirt or a checkered robe over her daughter's crib and drew 
stark pictures for her. "I think she liked it. It's hard to say, but I felt 
good doing it," said Klafter, who serenaded her 20-month-old with classical 
music before birth. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts warn that newborns can overdose on lightning bolts, checker boards 
and other bold black-and-white graphics. 
</P>
<P>
"You can overdo a good thing," cautioned Robert Duckman, an optometry professor 
at the State University of New York, who has been researching infant vision for 
the past decade. "While it is a good stimulation technique, (black and white) 
can and has been overdone. 
</P>
<P>
"Making everything black and white in a child's world is not something I would 
consider a positive, healthy approach because the world is not black and 
white," Duckman added. "The world is not a constant high-level stimulation." 
</P>
<P>
An infant should be exposed to black-and-white toys for not more than 20 
minutes at a time, suggested Duckman, who advocates banishing black-and-white 
sheets from the bedroom to allow infants to slip into slumber peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
As for those popular pastel and other colored toys and baby items, they can be 
given to infants but they probably really appreciate them only later, experts 
said, adding their research on this perceptual issue is still ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
Ludington-Hoe -- author of "How to Have a Smarter Baby," and the creator of a 
line of deluxe infant toys for Vulli, a French company -- agrees that parents 
should not completely immerse a baby in a two-color nursery. 
</P>
<P>
But when infants tire of looking at black and white, they simply will turn 
away, said the UCLA professor, who taught actress Cybill Shepherd how to use 
black-and-white toys with her twins. 
</P>
<P>
Parents can invest in the black-and-white craze with just a black magic marker 
or several hundred dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Bellini Juvenile Designer Furniture, an upscale baby store on Ventura 
Boulevard, for instance, carries a zebra crib set -- with sheet, quilt, crib 
bumpers, pillow and dust ruffle -- for $610.

At nearby Baby Toytown 4 Babys Only, where the store's most popular stroller is 
a pricey black-and-white model, the latest trend also is well entrenched. But 
store manager Annette Hamilton suspects the phenomenon has more to do with 
aesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot of it is fashion," Hamilton said. "They (parents) like the look 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
But nobody is predicting that pandas or Dalmatians will steal the teddy bear's 
honored spot in the crib. Frankly, only an infant could appreciate some of 
these toys, which to some might look downright ugly. 
</P>
<P>
Grandmothers rank among the most stubborn skeptics. As toy advocate Vincent 
described it: "I do have to appeal to the grandmothers in society who are going 
to walk up to the crib and say, 'OOOHH! What are you doing to that child!' "

WHAT'S BLACK AND WHITE AND RED-HOT ALL OVER? CHIC TOTS' TOGS 
</P>

What started as an elite designer statement in children's wear several seasons 
ago now has a far broader appeal. Black, as a fashion color for kids, is no 
longer considered depressingly Dickensian, too grown-up or too serious for any 
but a few, special occasions. Black is even a baby basic, a chic color as 
sought after for children as it is for their style-conscious parents. 
</P>
<P>
"The time is right for black; people want to be unconventional," says Terry 
Jajati, owner of Bloomers in Hollywood, a store for infants through preteens. 
"They're having babies later, raising them differently, and these parents buy 
for their kids what they like, not what tradition dictates." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Took Off Last Fall 
</P>
<P>
It's not unusual anymore to find the most sophisticated black clothes, with 
such grown-up labels as Gianni Versace and Franco Moschino, in children's 
sizes, right next to more typical kiddie collections by such companies as Mrs. 
Taki's Kids and Feeline. 
</P>
<P>
There's plenty of black at Bloomers, and with it no mistaking that this is a 
trend-setting store. Jajati says: "The black craze took off last fall. I 
ordered a lot of it for spring and I'm almost out of it. There will be more for 
summer. I know my customers. They wear black and so do their children." 
</P>
<P>
If black is now acceptable for children after so many years when designers 
struggled unsuccessfully to make it so, there is also enough variety in the 
styling to give the clothes interest beyond their color. Looks for little 
children range from just-like-mommy sportswear separates and just-like-Madonna 
cotton/Lycra risque numbers, to more traditionally elegant and freshly innocent 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Look of Innocence 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles designer Malina Gerber and Italian master Gianni Versace represent 
the latter. Gerber says: "I like to mix black with other colors so there is an 
innocence about the look and children still look like children." 
</P>
<P>
Versace takes on a more formal tone. "His approach is high quality and not 
overloaded with frills," says Ute Pancer, owner of Belli Bambini, a West 
Hollywood shop that recently held a Versace fall showing for children's wear. 
Black velvet dresses with crisp white collars and delicate lace trims were 
favorites as were black-and-white tweed coats trimmed in black velvet. Prices 
range from $150 to $450 for school-age children up to Size 10. 
</P>
<P>
Other designers blend grown-up trends, the color black and the innocence of 
children's fashion. Los Angeles designer Enid Harris and Michael Sui of Mrs. 
Taki's Kids are pacesetters in this field. 
</P>
<P>
Harris' spring styles for girls sizes 2 through 8 include clean-lined, silk, 
tiered dresses accessorized with silk roses. For dress-up, she shows a 
basic-black chiffon, Empire silhouette "cocktail" dress. Sleek cotton/Lycra 
separates are meant to be softened with little-girl-fantasy ballerina tutus, 
flounce skirts and fluid jumpers worn on top. 
</P>
<P>
Originally a television and movie costume designer, Harris started her business 
a year ago as a panic reaction to the Screenwriters' strike. Now her flights of 
fantasy, priced from $15 to $160, are carried in progressive children's-wear 
stores such as American Rag Cie Youth and Bloomers. Even Maxfield, that 
stalwart center of style that saturated adult fashion devotees with black a few 
years ago, carries Harris' children's line. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Twirlable Things 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't see pink and blue anymore," she says. That's been done enough. 
Black is beautiful on kids. Last week we did a photo shoot and all the little 
girls went straight for the black. You can twirl in my things, they have little 
petticoats or jewels or flowers -- that's what little girls like." 
</P>
<P>
Before he became designer for the Mrs. Taki's Kids collections, designer Sui 
learned the importance of black while working with New York ready to wear 
designers Louis Dell'Olio for Anne Klein, and with Donna Karan. 
</P>
<P>
Karan, Klein and Mrs. Taki's Kids are owned by Tomio Taki now. His wife, 
Beverly, heads the childrens' line, now about a year old, and Adam, the 
youngest of their four sons, provided the inspiration for it. Ironically, the 
collection is now aimed largely at girls aged 7 to 14. 
</P>
<P>
"I always use black as a ground color and contrast it with white or brights," 
Sui explains. "It's a Seventh Avenue influence filtered down to kids. Now 
there's no time lag in fashion from adults to children. What makes black fun 
for kids to wear are optical-effect details. Stripes, bright prints and 
separates. That's where the individuality comes in so kids can create their own 
looks." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
European Influence 
</P>
<P>
For spring, black and white was Mrs. Taki's Kids' predominant color story, in 
easy pants, swing skirts, print shirts and T-shirts. For fall, add a 
salt-and-pepper tweed toggle coat, a black gabardine dress with pleated skirt 
and white, Puritan collar, or a Chanel-type suit complete with quilted leather 
handbag. Prices range from $20 to around $100 at stores, including Nordstrom, 
Neiman Marcus and I. Magnin. 
</P>
<P>
"The influence stems from Europe but the feeling is much broader than that," 
Sui notes. "There's an instinct now to get back to basics, back to traditional 
values and to break the rules a bit. People also want quality and longevity. 
Black is the color that represents all of that." 
</P>
<P>
But black is not just for school-age kids. Even infants are being dressed in 
the classic color, and baby experts support the trend, just as they approve of 
black-and-white toys, bedding, furniture and learning tools for infants. Among 
new parents who favor the trend are Spago owner-chef Wolfgang Puck, and his 
wife Barbara Lazaroff. And the visible proof came in the form of no fewer than 
11 black-and-white baby showers for Barbara, held this spring. She specified 
her preference for the two basic colors when asked about gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Like other savvy parents, Lazaroff says, she understands the benefits of black 
and white for infants. Always known as a fashion plate, she also admits that 
she simply liked the look of black and white Holstein cow patterns, and 
decorated her new baby boy's nursery entirely in that bovine motif. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How Far Will It Go? 
</P>
<P>
Where is all of this infatuation with black fashion for children leading? 
Designers, retailers, parents and baby experts agree that early exposure to 
various stimuli determines later behavior. Retailers translate the notion to 
matters of style, of course. 
</P>
<P>
"If a child learns taste, quality and individuality early, they will relate to 
it more as adults," says Pancer of Belli Bambini. "I think modern parents 
learned it and are continuing to teach it to the next generation." 
</P>

<P>
In an effort to get a jump on the big three networks, Fox Broadcasting Co. said 
Tuesday that it will launch at least part of its new fall season in August. 
</P>
<P>
The upstart fourth network will premiere a new season of "America's Most 
Wanted" Aug. 20. Then on Aug. 27, Fox will inaugurate a new season of its 
top-rated show, "Married . . . With Children," in its new 9 p.m. time period, 
and also will debut "Open House," a new incarnation of Fox's "Duet," at 9:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Fox already had said it will present some new programming in July. On July 9, 
Fox will launch a new series, "Totally Hidden Video," for a six-week run. And 
it will air the much-publicized "Cops in Russia" episode Saturday, July 15 at 8 
p.m., with fresh episodes of the "Cops" series beginning the following week and 
continuing through the summer. STEVE WEINSTEIN

L.A. CABLE SYSTEMS OFFER PROGRAMMING FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WEINSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time, local cable systems have banded together to air a festival 
of some of the best cable programs from the past year to help champion them for 
Emmy Award consideration. 
</P>
<P>
And while the three-weekend festival that begins Thursday is clearly designed 
to influence members of the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences during 
the Emmy nominating period, regular cable viewers will benefit too. Subscribers 
of 28 cable systems will be able to watch the programs on a free public-access 
channel, even though some of the fare comes from pay channels. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the first that cable programs were eligible for night-time Emmys, 
the cable industry received only 15 out of the 337 total nominations. Some 
cable executives complained that the nominating process, which does not require 
academy members to have seen the programs that they vote to nominate, worked 
against cable programming. They contended that with only about half the homes 
in the Los Angeles area wired for cable, many academy members might never have 
had the opportunity to view any cable programs. And others who did subscribe 
probably wouldn't receive all of the pay channels. 
</P>
<P>
"When you consider the enormous quantity of programming on cable, it's easy to 
miss some of this stuff," said Chris Derick, president of the Southern 
California Cable Assn. "I remember going to the ACE Awards (cable's version of 
the Emmys) and saying, 'I never heard of that show. That's a wonderful show.' A 
lot of (Academy) members never had a chance to see what is available. So there 
was an interest to create some kind of informal screening process for Emmy 
voters." 
</P>
<P>
But Derick, who is also president of Choice Television, the cable operator for 
Pasadena and the San Gabriel Valley, said that cable operators decided that the 
festival could be a valuable promotional tool too. 
</P>
<P>
"We very quickly realized that we had a bigger interest in telling our regular 
customers what our better product is," Derick said. "It has become more of a 
customer promotional event now -- to give the general public a chance to see 
the good stuff that is on both basic and pay cable. That's what's driving it." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight Southern California cable systems, including Century, Choice, 
Continental, Comcast, Falcon, Paragon, Simmons, United and West Valley 
Cablevision in the Los Angeles area, will participate in the 12-day festival. 
</P>
<P>
The special presentation -- with programs submitted by Arts &amp; Entertainment 
Network, Cable News Network, the Disney Channel, the Family Channel, Home Box 
Office, Showtime, TBS, USA and the Nashville Network -- can be seen Thursday 
through Sunday for the next three weeks from 8-11 p.m. each night. (Viewers 
should call their cable operator for a complete schedule of programs and for 
the channel on which these shows will be featured.) 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Cable Assn. has taken out ads in Emmy magazine, Daily 
Variety and the Hollywood Reporter to alert Emmy voters to the special 
screenings. TV Academy members will cast their Emmy nominating ballots from 
June 29-July 16. (Cable executives say they do not have a gripe with the way 
the Emmy winners are selected because voting in the final round is done only by 
judges who have seen all the nominees at academy-sponsored screenings.) 
</P>
<P>
HBO, which won all three Emmys awarded to cable last year, is pushing "Tanner 
'88" and two original movies, "Dead Man Out" and "Glory! Glory!" for Emmy 
consideration this year. Showtime has submitted an episode of "It's Garry 
Shandling's Show" and a couple of concert specials. USA has episodes of "The 
Hitchhiker" and "Alfred Hitchcock Presents"; CNN will offer some of its recent 
coverage of China; the Disney Channel is pushing a documentary on the history 
of the Disney company; Arts &amp; Entertainment has "The Eagle and The Bear -- 
Dateline: 1961, Cuba," and TNN will show "Roy Clark's Friendship Tour: USSR." 
</P>
<P>
Movietime and KROQ-FM deejay Richard Blade will host the festival. Derick said 
he is hopeful that it will become an annual tradition.

10 OFFICERS HURT AS FIREWORKS CACHE EXPLODES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD and DARRELL DAWSEY, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten Los Angeles police officers were injured Tuesday when two blasts, believed 
to be related to a "major fireworks cache," ripped through a Koreatown 
apartment where the police bomb squad had been dispatched after its tenant had 
sought medical care for a blown-apart hand. 
</P>
<P>
The tenant, whom neighbors described as an eccentric recluse, was arrested for 
investigation of possession of an explosive device. He was being held in the 
jail ward at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The injured officers, including four from the bomb squad, suffered minor to 
moderate injuries in the initial blast. It occurred about 6 a.m. in a white, 
wood-frame Victorian house at 943 Menlo Ave. that had been converted into five 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Explosion 
</P>
<P>
A second, much larger explosion occurred 10 minutes later inside the same 
one-room, first-floor apartment, just after the injured had been hastily 
evacuated. It sent fireballs spewing skyward and knocked out plate-glass 
windows in an adjacent apartment building, cutting an occupant's foot. Fire 
engulfed the apartment house where the blasts occurred, gutting it. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the occupants of the house and some nearby residents had been evacuated 
by police before the first blast, and all had been evacuated before the second. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested was Gary Wexler, 39, who boasted of being a "pyrotechnics expert." 
Wexler, who lived alone, was described by his landlord and neighbors as a 
recluse who acted paranoid at times and became most upset when fellow tenants 
left the front door open. The landlord said he believed that Wexler had once 
sold imported fireworks from his apartment, but never suspected that any were 
stored in the one-room unit he rented for $250 a month. 
</P>
<P>
The bizarre episode began to unfold about 3 a.m., when Wexler showed up at 
Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center with a hand injury. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital personnel became suspicious because his account of what had happened 
to his hand did not seem to be consistent with his injury. They summoned 
police, but before an officer could arrive, Wexler left the hospital, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wexler returned to the hospital a short time later because, police speculated, 
he realized the extent of the injury to his mangled hand. At that time, he was 
arrested, his car was impounded and 10 carloads of police, including a bomb 
squad detail, were dispatched to his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Bomb specialists Dan Johnson and Bob Gollhofer entered the house first and 
immediately spotted a large amount of fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
"You can bet it was a lot," police spokesman William Frio said of the cache. 
</P>
<P>
The bomb experts kept moving through the apartment, Frio said, because "they 
considered (the fireworks) stable." 
</P>
<P>
They were searching through the apartment when the first blast occurred at a 
still-undetermined spot in the room. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson and Gollhofer suffered facial cuts and burns in the initial blast and 
Johnson later complained of chest pains and symptoms indicative of a 
concussion. Outside in the yard, three other officers suffered minor injuries 
related to the blast, including damaged eardrums and smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
After the first blast, the detachment of officers retreated from the house and 
stepped up evacuations in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Five more officers suffered smoke inhalation as they removed the injured bomb 
squad specialists from the apartment. They were treated at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
About six hours after the blasts, as firefighters, federal agents and police 
officers mopped up the scene, all but one of the five hospitalized officers had 
been released. Johnson, 34, a six-year police veteran, remained under 
observation. 
</P>
<P>
Police by late Tuesday had not determined what caused the first blast, but Frio 
said it was not the pile of fireworks Johnson and Gollhofer had spotted. 
</P>
<P>
That cache, however, is believed to have been ignited by the first explosion 
and supplied the force behind the second, larger blast. 
</P>
<P>
It took firefighters 30 minutes to extinguish the flames from the explosions. 
Afterward, the roof was gone and four of the five apartments appeared gutted. 
</P>
<P>
Wexler has had "several contacts" with the police in the past, Frio said, 
declining to disclose the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
As Los Angeles police technicians and personnel from the federal Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms Bureau collected buckets of evidence from the charred 
structure, evacuees and other neighbors stood around in knots trying to 
understand what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
They described Wexler as an eccentric who pretty much stayed to himself, smoked 
foul-smelling cigars and burned incense incessantly to cover up the odor. 
</P>
<P>
Wexler's landlord, Dean Lanza, 48, said Wexler had lived in the apartment for 
about seven years, and except for one incident -- which also involved fireworks 
-- had not been a problem. 
</P>
<P>
About six years ago, Lanza said, police arrested Wexler and searched his 
apartment after he was caught setting off fireworks in a park. Officers, 
according to Lanza, found a container of gunpowder in the apartment at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Lanza, who suspected that Wexler sold Tijuana-made fireworks, said he tried to 
evict Wexler, but later gave up. 
</P>
<P>
"He tried to tell me he was a pyrotechnics expert, but I didn't believe him," 
Lanza said. "He promised he wouldn't have anything else to do with fireworks 
and as far as I knew, he didn't." 
</P>
<P>
He has not been in Wexler's apartment in two years, Lanza said, adding that 
when he was there last he saw no fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
The landlord said, however, that officers who questioned him Tuesday about 
Wexler had showed him a photo album they said was found in the suspect's 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"They had pictures of him standing holding fireworks," Lanza said. 
</P>
<P>
Wexler underwent reconstructive surgery Tuesday morning on his hand at 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. He was later transferred to the jail ward at 
County-USC Medical Center, where he was booked.

REINSTATE PROFESSOR, PANEL ORDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A state board has ordered the reinstatement of a longtime Cal State Northridge 
professor who was fired last summer for allegedly offering students A grades if 
they sold raffle tickets to raise money for his nonprofit foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Three members of the state Personnel Board voted Monday to suspend Prof. Eleazu 
Obinna for 90 days, then ordered CSUN to give him back his job in the 
Pan-African studies department. 
</P>
<P>
The board, voting in closed session, upheld the opinion of Administrative Law 
Judge Byron Berry, who said there was not enough evidence to support university 
allegations that Obinna offered his students A grades if they sold $100 worth 
of raffle tickets for the United Crusade Foundation. Berry wrote an opinion for 
the board after hearing seven days of testimony during hearings on the CSUN 
campus during the fall and winter. 
</P>
<P>
Berry said he recommended Obinna's suspension because of unprofessional conduct 
for "selling tickets in connection with a class. It is not an appropriate class 
activity." 
</P>
<P>
CSUN officials would not say whether they will appeal the board's decision.

Hundreds of Soviet citizens helped 11-year-old Tony Aliengena unfurl his 
1,000-foot-long friendship scroll in the heart of Red Square today, some of 
them abandoning their places in line to see Lenin's Tomb. 
</P>
<P>
Tony, of San Juan Capistrano, later met with an aide to Soviet leader Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev inside the Kremlin to deliver the document, which was signed by 
250,000 American schoolchildren and is designed to further world peace. 
</P>
<P>
When his 47-day around-the-world trip is completed, Tony will present President 
Bush a friendship scroll signed by Soviet youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Tony, accompanied by his father, began the global flight in his blue-and-white 
Cessna Centurion on June 5. His flight plan will take him 19,000 miles around 
the world in short hops averaging three hours each and, if completed 
successfully, would make him the youngest person to fly around the world.

1,000 BATTLE BRUSH FIRE IN NATIONAL FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
More than 1,000 firefighters from throughout California, Oregon and Washington 
battled a 3,500-acre brush fire that continued to rage out of control in the 
Cleveland National Forest this morning near the Orange-Riverside county border. 
</P>
<P>
By mid-morning, a U.S. Forestry Service spokesman said that the speed of the 
blaze had slowed substantially and that 30% of the fire had been contained. 
</P>
<P>
Because conditions in the area are the driest in 30 years, however, officials 
said they have brought in an extraordinary number of firefighters to attack the 
blaze from the air and ground. 
</P>
<P>
"We're ready for a battle," Tom Horner, U.S. Forestry Service spokesman, said 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire, which erupted about 4 p.m. Tuesday near the Upper San 
Juan campground 15 miles east of Interstate 5, had not been determined, Horner 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega Highway, the primary link between south Orange County and Lake Elsinore 
in Riverside County, has been closed since the fire broke out, meaning long 
detours for commuters. The California Highway Patrol said this morning that, 
even if the fire is contained today, the highway will remain closed between 
Caspers Regional Park and Grand Avenue in Lake Elsinore for at least two days 
to repair fire damage. 
</P>
<P>
Residents -- officials said they did not know how many -- were evacuated as the 
blaze threatened up to 100 homes in the area. However, none of the 125 
buildings dotting the remote canyons and hills in the area was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The American Red Cross opened two evacuation centers in the Lake Elsinore area 
-- one at Lake Elsinore High School -- but they were virtually empty. 
</P>
<P>
Two firefighters were injured at the edge of the blaze. One hurt his back and 
was taken by helicopter to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission 
Viejo. The other suffered a minor foot injury, officials said.

The nuclear industry has not cooperated with the federal government in 
tightening maintenance rules for nuclear power plants, the outgoing head of the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission said today. 
</P>
<P>
"The nuclear industry should have been more cooperative with us and they were 
not," said Lando Zech, who steps down as NRC chairman Friday after a three-year 
term. 
</P>
<P>
Zech said the state of the nuclear industry as a whole is healthy, but added 
that he was "somewhat disappointed" to have made little progress on tightening 
maintenance standards. 
</P>
<P>
Zech said the nuclear industry, which has not applied to build a new nuclear 
plant in 11 years, faces an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
"Nuclear power supplies 20% of U.S. electricity needs safely now, but it's 
impossible to say where we're going," Zech said. "I have no crystal ball." 
</P>
<P>
Zech will be replaced by NRC Commissioner Kenneth Carr.

An inmate awaiting charges of drug possession escaped from a minimum-security 
jail in El Toro this morning but is "not considered a danger to the public," an 
Orange County Sheriff's Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Eugene Lawson, a 34-year-old transient, was discovered missing from the 
James A. Musick Branch Jail when deputies took a head count at 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Richard Olson said it is not known how Lawson escaped the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Lawson, who is described as 5 feet, 8 inches tall and weighing 140 pounds, with 
brown hair and hazel eyes, was arrested June 14 on a charge of possession of 
narcotics. Olson said bail had been set at $10,000.

A college student has lost a bid to collect a $1.1-million casino jackpot he 
hit while gambling illegally as a 19-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
State District Judge Donald Mosley Tuesday upheld a ruling by state gaming 
regulators allowing Caesars Palace to refuse to pay Kirk Erickson, now 21, of 
Royal, Ark., the jackpot he won on a $1 slot machine in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that Nevada law bars those under 21 from gambling, Mosley said his 
ruling centered on whether a person should be allowed to profit from an illegal 
act. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson said he will appeal.

Donald Trump is fishing for another yacht, his 292-foot Trump Princess being 
too small for entertaining high rollers from his two booming Atlantic City 
casinos. 
</P>
<P>
The new super-yacht will cost about $140 million, the New York Post and New 
York Newsday reported today. Trump, a billionaire developer, said he's 
accepting bids from boat builders for "something in excess of 400 feet long, 
closer to 500 feet." 
</P>
<P>
Trump bought the Princess from the Sultan of Brunei for $29 million and 
refitted it at a cost of $10 million last year. The yacht, with 11 suites, 210 
telephones, gold-plated fittings and a disco, was lampooned in the comic strip 
"Doonesbury."

Japan's Prime Minister Sosuke Uno is so shaken by fresh rumors of his 
involvement in a squalid sex scandal that he had to be put to bed by ruling 
party elders, a party aide said today. 
</P>
<P>
An employee at the prime minister's residence and a party aide told Reuters Uno 
was put to bed Tuesday night by senior party members staying there to discuss 
the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he might have had a nervous breakdown last night," the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is he freaked out over how he's going to appear overseas at 
the (Paris) summit next month," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's afraid those leaders won't even want to shake hands with him." 
</P>
<P>
Uno, labeled "Mr. Clean" by the ruling party before the allegations of sexual 
misconduct surfaced, is due to attend a summit of the world's seven top 
industrialized nations in the French capital in July. 
</P>
<P>
Uno denied that he offered to resign Tuesday but was persuaded not to by 
Liberal Democratic Party elders. The public broadcasting network NHK and major 
newspapers said Uno made the offer after hearing of a magazine story about a 
new sex scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Krisher, editor of the gossip magazine Focus, said he was called by 
Uno's office late Tuesday about a report it will publish this week of Uno's 
alleged affair with a 16-year-old apprentice geisha. 
</P>
<P>
"His people denied the report, saying he couldn't possibly have been involved 
since it costs too much," Krisher told Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
Josei Jishin, a women's magazine, published a story Tuesday alleging Uno had an 
affair years ago with a bar hostess and he asked her to have an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Uno's personal secretary, who declined to be identified, said: "Japan's mass 
media write all kinds of things. I haven't read it of course, but I'm sure it's 
not correct." 
</P>
<P>
Local media said Liberal Democratic elders talked Uno out of resigning Tuesday 
night, arguing that it would mean domestic political chaos and a loss of 
international credibility. 
</P>
<P>
Such fears sent Tokyo stock prices plunging today as investors worried that the 
Liberal Democratic Party's 34-year grip on power was unraveling quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Uno's predecessor, Noboru Takeshita, quit in June because of his involvement in 
a scandal in which the Recruit publishing and telecommunications conglomerate 
allegedly gave away cash and cut-rate shares in return for political favors.

ECONOMIC INDICATORS PLUNGE 1.2% IN MAY; 
</P>
<P>
DECLINE GREATEST SINCE 1987 CRASH OF STOCK MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government's chief economic forecasting gauge plunged 1.2% in May, the 
biggest decline since the stock market crash in late 1987, the Commerce 
Department reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The decline in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators was the third in the 
last four months, as the gauge designed to foretell economic activity six to 
nine months into the future continued to flash strong signals of a significant 
decline in economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
The 1.2% decline was significantly steeper than analysts had been expecting. 
However, economists generally believe that the economy can escape a recession 
this year, although they are looking for a major slowing in economic growth 
accompanied by rising unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
The 1.2% drop in May followed a 0.6% gain posted in April. The index had fallen 
0.6% in March and 0.3% in February. 
</P>
<P>
The May decline was the steepest since a 1.8% plunge in November, 1987. That 
drop reflected the shock to the economy from the 508-point plunge in the Dow 
Jones index of 30 industrial stocks Oct. 19, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fed's Efforts Blamed 
</P>
<P>
The April increase had allowed the index to steer clear of the traditional 
signal of a forthcoming recession -- three declines in a row. But the May 
report added to the overall downward trend this year that has worried many 
economists. 
</P>
<P>
Today's index figure reinforced recent government and private industry reports 
that show almost every sector of the economy contracting because of the Federal 
Reserve Board's efforts to raise interest rates to control inflation. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, only two of the 11 forward-looking business statistics that make 
up the composite index -- higher stock prices and increased building permits -- 
pointed upward in May. 
</P>
<P>
The others pointed down: a drop in the money supply; lower prices for sensitive 
materials, indicating slower demand; the fourth consecutive drop in an index 
measuring consumer confidence; faster vendor deliveries, meaning declining 
demand; a shorter average workweek; fewer orders for plants and equipment; a 
decrease in manufacturers' unfilled orders; higher initial claims for jobless 
benefits; and a decrease in manufacturers' unfilled orders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Fear Recession 
</P>
<P>
The Fed has relaxed its grip slightly, but the effects remain. Some economists 
fear that, unless the central bank eases more, the economy could be pushed into 
a recession. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still looking for a soft landing without a recession, but we're keeping 
our fingers crossed," said David Wyss, senior financial economist at Data 
Resources Inc., in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser for the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, 
Pa., said, "I still think we'll avoid a recession, but the data probably is a 
little weaker than any of us had expected." 
</P>
<P>
In advance of today's report, most economic forecasters were predicting that 
the index would give up its April gain -- if not more. 
</P>
<P>
But they thought that the economy, now in its seventh year of expansion, would 
continue to grow, although slightly, this year. 
</P>
<P>
Chimerine described 1989 as a "transition into a long period of fairly slow 
growth," somewhere between 1% and 2%.

United Airlines pilots are refusing to fly Boeing 747-400 jumbo jets due for 
delivery next month in a contract dispute that has forced the airline to delay 
the start-up of service for the new planes. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that in light of (the pilots' union's) position, . . . immediate 
operation of the aircraft will complicate our contract negotiations," Hart 
Langer, United senior vice president of flight operations, wrote in a letter to 
pilots dated June 20. 
</P>
<P>
"Therefore," he wrote, "for the time being, the start-up of 747-400 service 
will be delayed." 
</P>
<P>
Boeing is due to deliver United's first 747-400 by July 5, a second one in 
August and two more before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Krakowski, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Assn., said United pilots 
will not fly the jets until a new contract is negotiated covering wages and 
working conditions for 747-400 cockpit crews. 
</P>
<P>
"The pilots have been working almost 1 1/2 years without a contract, and we'd 
like to see a new agreement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The new jets are expected to be used to expand United's Pacific routes.

U.S. Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills, a former secretary of Housing

</P>
<P>
"They hired her because of her expertise. I don't see a story in it," Clair

Hills represented Swezy Realty in 1987 and 1988 when she was in private

</P>
<P>
The two projects were in Florida's Dade and Broward counties.

Buchan said she believed that one project won funds and one was not approved, 
and she did not know their names or which was successful. She also said she did 
not know how much money was sought, or what Hills' fee was.

<P>
The New York Times reported in its editions today that Hills reported a fee of

Hills is the first prominent Republican in the Bush Administration known to 
have acted as a lobbyist for developers seeking HUD "moderate rehabilitation" 
funds under the Reagan Administration. The program is being investigated by 
Congress after revelations that well-connected developers won tens of millions 
of dollars in aid. 
</P>
<P>
Many Republican campaign advisers and former officials out of office, such as 
former Interior Secretary James G. Watt and former Massachusetts Sen. Edward 
Brooke, won six-figure fees for telephone calls to HUD officials on behalf of 
their clients.

China's state airline is unable to take delivery of five Boeing Co. airliners 
because the U.S. government has frozen licenses for technical exports to China, 
banking sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle-based Boeing was to have started delivering the aircraft to the China 
Aviation Administration Corp. this week, a Hong Kong banking source said. 
</P>
<P>
"One 757-400 should have been delivered this week but it is being held up 
indefinitely because Boeing cannot get export licenses from the U.S. 
government," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
Washington stopped issuing export licenses for all technical exports to China 
to protest the bloody June 4 crackdown in Tian An Men Square and the repression 
of dissent.

DOW DIVES 21.63 AMID FEARS OF A RECESSION

<TEXT>
<P>
Wall Street stocks fell today amid renewed fears of a recession after the 
government announced a larger-than-expected fall in the May leading economic 
indicators. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 21.63 points to 2,504.74, erasing the 
20.49 points the market advanced Tuesday in a broad-based rally. 
</P>
<P>
Declines led advances by more than 2-to-1 in moderate New York Stock Exchange 
volume of 158.47 million shares against 171.09 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index lost 1.31 to 181.87. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department announced in the morning that the Index of Leading 
Indicators, the government's gauge of future economic trends, fell 1.2% in May, 
the biggest drop in a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
The May decrease was slightly greater than economists' expectations for a 1% 
drop, and it was the biggest decline since a 1.8% fall in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Stock traders said the news prompted renewed concern that the economy may be 
slowing too quickly, which would tend to depress corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bond Prices Decline 
</P>
<P>
The credit market's powerful rally ran out of energy early today as traders 
sold to collect profits. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the selling involved long-term government securities, which pushed the 
yield on the market's bellwether 30-year Treasury bond back up to 8.11% from 
8.07% late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the key bond, which moves in the opposite direction to yield, 
tumbled 1/2 point, or $5 for every $1,000 in face value. The drop erased about 
half of Tuesday's gain. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Steen, a market analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., pinned the selloff 
on desires to cash in some winnings after the market's strong performance 
lately. 
</P>
<P>
"The price action here is related to profit-taking," said Steen. 
</P>
<P>
He said there was no fundamental economic reason for the retreat. 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department's report today on the Index of Leading Economic 
Indicators predictably provided evidence of slower growth. 
</P>
<P>
Bond traders have been bidding up prices on rising optimism that weak business 
activity would induce the Federal Reserve Board to pursue a more generous 
credit policy and drive down interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts, however, doubt the Fed will ease the rates. 
</P>
<P>
'The market has been thinking the Fed will ease rates to stimulate the economy 
but we don't think the economy is as weak as all that," Steen said. "We think 
there's still strength out there." 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term 
government issues were unchanged to down 5/32 point, intermediate maturities 
lost between 7/32 point to 7/16 point, and long-term issues slid 1/2 point to 
9/16 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, fell 3.46 to 1,179.09. 
</P>
<P>
In corporate trading, industrials posted minor losses. Moody's investment grade 
corporate bond index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, edged down 0.15 to 
326.75. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.31% as the discount rose 2 basis 
points to 8.04%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.18% as the discount 
increased 2 basis points to 7.76%. Yields on 1-year bills went up to 8.31% as 
the discount went up 2 basis points to 7.75%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9 9/16%, up from 9 7/16% late Tuesday.

Two witnesses testifying at the murder trial of former world middleweight 
boxing champion Carlos Monzon said Monday that he beat his wife and threw her 
from a second-floor balcony like a "sack of potatoes." 
</P>
<P>
"He gave her a one-two combination of cross punches to the face and she fell to 
the floor," said Rafael Crisanto Baez, a 57-year-old rubbish collector who 
passed by the Monzon vacation house with his junk cart on the day of her death, 
Feb. 14, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Monzon testified in his own defense Monday, both denying and admitting that he 
hit his wife. He denied throwing her off the balcony. 
</P>
<P>
Monzon stared at Baez impassively during Tuesday's session. Defense attorney 
Jorge de la Canale asked that the witness be prosecuted for perjury. But a 
second witness, Rafael Moyano, a waiter in a bar, later testified he also saw 
Monzon beat his wife and throw her from the balcony. 
</P>
<P>
The public phase of the trial is expected to continue until Friday, with 
testimony from 31 witnesses.

GIAMATTI GIVEN 2ND COURT DEFEAT ON ROSE; 
</P>
<P>
APPEALS PANEL REFUSES TO UPSET ORDER BLOCKING DISCIPLINARY HEARING

<P>
A state appeals court today refused to disturb a judge's order temporarily 
preventing the commissioner of baseball from holding a disciplinary hearing on 
charges that Pete Rose bet on his own team's games. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was the second court loss in four days for Commissioner A. Bartlett 
Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Common Pleas Judge Norbert A. Nadel granted Rose a 14-day temporary 
restraining order blocking the hearing. Nadel said Giamatti had already made up 
his mind against Rose and could not give him a fair hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's lawyers asked an Ohio appeals court to nullify the order, arguing 
that it interferes with the commissioner's powers to protect the integrity of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
But a three-judge appellate panel this afternoon said it has no authority to 
review a temporary restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's lawyers could not be immediately reached for comment on whether they 
will pursue their appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Rose is accused of gambling on his own team, an offense that could get him 
banned from the game for life. 
</P>
<P>
The allegations against the Cincinnati Reds manager are in a 225-page report by 
chief baseball investigator John M. Dowd and eight accompanying volumes of 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the report contains statements by a former Rose associate 
that Rose conferred with other baseball managers before deciding whether to bet 
on their teams and tried to get involved in cocaine deals. 
</P>
<P>
The drug accusations against Rose were made in February by Paul Janszen, a 
bodybuilder who recently completed a four-month stay in a halfway house for 
failing to report income from the sale of steroids on his taxes. He said Rose 
tried to get involved in the cocaine deals of his other associates. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Rose has been publicly linked to drugs by testimony in 
the investigation, which was announced March 20. The report was released 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Janszen didn't say Rose used drugs but said the manager thought he could get 
cash from drug deals conducted by a circle of associates. Rose sometimes had 
trouble paying his large gambling debts, Janszen said. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the associates were sentenced after federal authorities cracked a 
ring that took cocaine from Florida to Ohio.

With his father's troubles mounting, Pete Rose Jr. has been given permission to 
leave the Baltimore Orioles' Class A farm team at Erie, Pa., for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
He told Manager Bobby Tolan of his decision on Sunday after the Orioles urged 
him to consider taking the time off if he needed it. The suggestion was made 
Friday because the Orioles believed that Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose Sr. 
would have his hearing with Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted him to know if he took some time off it was fine with us," Orioles 
Farm Director Doug Melvin said. "We left it up to him, but we know it has been 
tough. There have been a lot of media waiting to see him and fans hassle him 
and so forth."

The Reds have placed third baseman Chris Sabo on the 15-day disabled list 
because he has a hyper-extended left knee, the ball club said today. 
</P>
<P>
The listing is retroactive to Tuesday, the Reds said. Sabo was injured June 9 
in Los Angeles in a home plate collision with Dodgers catcher Mike Scioscia. 
Infielder Marty Brown, who played 10 games with the Reds last September, was 
called up from the Reds' Nashville farm team to replace Sabo.

PADRES SNAP DODGER TIE IN 17TH INNING WITH 5-3 WIN

June has been a long month for the Los Angeles Dodgers, and the San Diego 
Padres made it even longer Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Chris James' run-scoring single snapped a tie in the 17th inning as the Padres 
beat the Dodgers 5-3. It was the second marathon game of the month for the 
Dodgers. On June 3, they lost to Houston in 22 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Gwynn started the 17th with a one-out bad-hop single over the head of 
second baseman Willie Randolph and stole second. Tim Belcher, 4-8, 
intentionally walked Jack Clark before James followed with a single to right 
field. Clark went to third on the hit and scored on Garry Templeton's sacrifice 
fly to left. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care how it looked. It was a good win for us. We're trying to get our 
act together," Gwynn said. "When you play 17 innings and you come up with a 'W' 
you feel like all the effort was worth it. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest thing to do, especially for the hitters, is to keep your 
concentration after the 12th inning because the bat speed is not going to be 
the same, the legs are not the same and you really have to bear down." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Clements, 1-0, pitched 4 2/3 innings for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres struck out 18 times, including 15 by the Dodgers' bullpen. The game 
took five hours and 21 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
John Tudor, making his first appearance after undergoing off-season 
reconstructive surgery on his pitching elbow, lasted only 4 1/3 innings while 
allowing two runs and five hits for the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"He was throwing the ball great. He was awesome against me,". Gwynn said of 
Tudor.

Jimmy Connors was given an early exit from Wimbledon today, upset by American 
Dan Goldie in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Goldie's 7-6, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2 victory was the biggest upset of the tournament's 
first three days and marked only the third time in 18 years that the 
10th-seeded Connors had failed to make at least the fourth round of the 
grass-court Grand Slam tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Top seeds Ivan Lendl and Steffi Graf advanced into the third round at Wimbledon 
today, while an unheralded American upset one of the women's seeds. 
</P>
<P>
Shaun Stafford, 20, from Gainesville, Fla., ranked 78th in the world, beat 
13th-seeded Helen Kelesi of Canada 7-6, 7-5 in a first-round match. 
</P>
<P>
Also upset was men's No. 11 seed Brad Gilbert of the United States. In the 
completion of a first-round match suspended by darkness Tuesday, Gilbert lost 
to John Fitzgerald of Australia 6-2, 7-5, 1-6, 3-6, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Most other seeds had much less trouble on a day of rain and rail strikes. Fans 
struggled to the All England Lawn Tennis Club despite walkouts by subway and 
railroad workers, then waited through a 3 1/2-hour rain delay.

Sanchez Beats Czech 
</P>
<P>
Arantxa Sanchez, 17, the French Open women's champion and the seventh seed at 
Wimbledon, won her opening match, beating Jana Pospisilova of Czechoslovakia 
6-2, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Eighth-seeded Pam Shriver of the United States beat Carin Bakkum of The 
Netherlands 6-2, 6-1, and 12th-seeded Mary Joe Fernandez of the United States 
defeated Mary Lou Daniels 6-4, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Graf took only 43 minutes to beat American amateur Kim Kessaris 6-2, 6-1. The 
defending women's champion lost only five points as she went from 2-2 in the 
first set to a 1-0 lead in the second. Kessaris, 16, from Hendersonville, N.C., 
held for 1-1, but Graf then won the last five games with the loss of only six 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl, the men's top seed who was stretched to five sets in his opener on 
Monday, dropped the first set in a tiebreaker to Sweden's Ronnie Bathman, then 
rallied for a 6-7, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 victory on Centre Court.

EXPLOSIONS STILL RING IN EARS OF NEIGHBORS

Directing a pained squint at the gutted wood-frame building that only hours 
before had been his home, a disheveled Jack Caminiti leaned against a palm tree 
Tuesday as he pondered his future. 
</P>
<P>
"All of my clothes, my belongings, my cane -- everything is in there," lamented 
Caminiti, a resident of the Koreatown apartment house that was ripped apart by 
two explosions Tuesday morning. "Almost everything I own is gone. And I have no 
idea what I'm going to do. . . . I just wish I'd had time to grab something out 
of there." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Caminiti, who is partially blind, chose to save his most valuable 
possession -- his life. 
</P>
<P>
"The police came and banged on my door and helped me out of there," said 
Caminiti, who was wearing only the bathrobe and slippers he managed to throw on 
before fleeing. "They helped me out of there just before the place blew up." 
</P>
<P>
Ten police officers were injured in the blasts, a pair of fireworks-related 
explosions that tore through the two-story Victorian house at 943 Menlo Ave. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tenant Arrested 
</P>
<P>
Gary Wexler, a tenant who police believe hoarded a large amount of fireworks 
that may have triggered the blast, was arrested after the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
And now, milling about among the throng of neighbors, firefighters and police 
officers outside their charred home, Caminiti and his fellow tenants tried 
desperately to make sense of the incident -- and of Gary Wexler. 
</P>
<P>
"The explosion was like an earthquake," said Kim Dong Kim, 29, who lives next 
door to the apartment house. "It felt like a huge rumble." 
</P>
<P>
Another neighbor, who declined to be identified, said he dropped to the ground 
as soon as he heard the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
"I just fell," said the man, who was across the street when the building 
exploded. "I covered my head and stayed there for a few minutes. Then I got up 
and ran." 
</P>
<P>
Unhui Harris, who lives in a nearby building, said she had just returned from 
church when she heard the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked out of the window, and I saw four or five police cars," Harris said. 
"It all looked really suspicious. Then, all of a sudden, something blew up. I 
saw policemen fall down and glass go everywhere. I told my husband to call the 
Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God only the windows were damaged. I thought it could have been much, 
much worse." 
</P>
<P>
Added her husband, David: "I was in the (bedroom) when I heard it. I was 
worried it would hit this building, and all the apartments would blow up. I was 
shocked." 
</P>
<P>
When told of Wexler's possible role, neighbors registered little surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, the (explosion) is hard to fathom," said Cliff Jones, 25, who lived on 
the second floor of the Victorian building. "But (Wexler) being the one to do 
it isn't. . . . He's not altogether your average person. There was something 
very odd about him." 
</P>
<P>
Jones recalled an incident about three months ago when he heard another 
explosion -- a much milder one -- from Wexler's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"I went downstairs, and he was standing naked and dripping wet in the doorway 
of his apartment," said Jones. "He claimed he was in the shower, and a butane 
lighter had blown up in his face. . . . He was really strange; even some of my 
friends who had passed him in the hall commented on him."
