ONCE IGNITED, HARD TO STOP; 
</P>
<P>
* COMBATING SHAKE ROOFS AND ARSONISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Too much of Southern California has been burning. Hundreds of houses, primarily 
those with shake roofs, have been incinerated in communities from Santa Barbara 
south to San Diego. There are many culprits, including the drought, but two of 
them are criminal. 
</P>
<P>
The state must ban wood shake roofs. The flames leapfrogged from shake roof to 
shake roof in Santa Barbara, where as many as 350 homes have been destroyed or 
damaged and over 3,500 acres charred by a blaze apparently started by an 
arsonist. Preliminary damage estimates have been set at $200 million, which 
would make that inferno the most expensive fire in the state's history. 
</P>
<P>
Arsonists started several other fires, including a major blaze in Glendale, 
where as many as 66 houses have been damaged or destroyed; 90% of those homes 
had wood shake shingle roofs. Gov. Deukmejian has offered a $50,000 reward for 
information leading to those responsible for the fires. 
</P>
<P>
The fires are a huge economic tragedy for the five-county region. The human 
toll is unmeasurable. Hundreds of families are now homeless; many have lost 
everything. Fortunately, there have been no deaths. Heroic firefighters have 
suffered burns, smoke inhalation and heat exhaustion while battling the flames 
in temperatures topping 105 degrees and in the face of strong winds that have 
swept the flames across streets and even freeways. 
</P>
<P>
For as long as Californians have built homes on dry hillsides, shake roofs have 
fueled too many fires. But local officials are powerless to impose stronger 
codes. Mayor Bradley and the Los Angeles City Council approved a local ban last 
year, for example, but the state attorney general's office ruled that local 
communities lack the authority to approve local codes that are stricter than 
state codes. That decision puts the matter in the hands of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed legislation would restore the authority of local jurisdictions to 
impose stricter fire codes. That measure merits approval in spite of opposition 
by the $150-million cedar-shake industry. 
</P>
<P>
Shake roofs are rustic and charming but fire safety is not a matter of 
aesthetics. As the ashes cool, the state must proceed with a total ban on all 
wood shake roofs.

VETERANS AT WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's sad: Once soldiers side by side. Now veterans waring among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Who should be listed on a proposed L.A. monument to American soldiers of 
Japanese ancestry? The question threatens a community project designed to honor 
those who served in three segregated World War II units. 
</P>
<P>
One group wants the privately funded monument in Little Tokyo to list the names 
of all 12,000 members -- living and dead -- of the Army's all-Japanese-American 
100th Battalion and 442nd Infantry Regimental Combat Team, which served in 
Europe, and the Military Intelligence Service in the Pacific. An opposing group 
wants to honor only the 700 killed during World War II, but to include the 
names of 325 Japanese-Americans who died during the Spanish-American War, World 
War I and the Korean and Vietnam conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
The debate is muddling the intent of the monument: To make a special 
acknowledgement of the blood, sweat and tears of those Japanese-American 
soldiers who fought hard to prove their loyalty to the United States so their 
families, unjustly interned in U.S. concentration camps during the war, would 
be more readily accepted by other Americans. 
</P>
<P>
They were tested as few others were. They deserve an enduring testimonial -- 
one designed with the names of all the Japanese-Americans who served in World 
War II as the centerpiece of the monument. The design also could incorporate 
secondarily the names of others who died in combat. 
</P>
<P>
They don't deserve to be fought over like this.

OUTRAGEOUS BACK-ROOM DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier this month, when he found the Board of Supervisors had conspired to 
disenfranchise Los Angeles County's 2 million Latinos during its last 
redistricting, U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon gave the supervisors a 
chance to redeem themselves by drawing boundaries that would meet the demands 
of equity and law. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, minutes before the judge's deadline, the majority -- Mike 
Antonovich, Deane Dana and Pete Schabarum -- gave the court a plan whose only 
impressive feature was its breathtaking contempt for the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to create a district with a Latino majority, while still 
maintaining the current board's five-seat configuration, the supervisors simply 
have gerrymandered a 3rd District. Not only are its boundaries geographically 
absurd, but it also contains a popular, well-financed incumbent, Ed Edelman, 
who will be difficult for any challenger to unseat. Judge Kenyon now will have 
to draw rational districts himself -- a process that probably will begin with 
expansion of the board to seven or more members. 
</P>
<P>
The other act of malice committed by the board's majority Wednesday may be 
harder to undo. In a secret 3-2 vote, the supervisors agreed to immediately pay 
its law firm, Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft, $500,000 to represent a 
"third-party citizen," who will appeal or "collaterally attack" Kenyon's ruling 
all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The secret pact "designates (retiring) 
Supervisor Peter F. Schabarum or his delegate as the citizen who shall pursue 
the litigation." If the law firm, which also is pressing the board's own appeal 
of the ruling, is found to have a conflict of interest, Schabarum simply will 
be allowed to take the public's money and hire the lawyer of his choice. 
</P>
<P>
This back-room deal obviously is aimed at blocking a legally elected board from 
ending the wasteful appeal of Kenyon's ruling upon which the current majority 
has embarked. This cynical, secretive, ruthlessly self-interested raid on 
public funds is without precedent. Recall would not be too strong a step to 
take against those who carried it out.

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO CONTROLLING AIDS EPIDEMIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a health-care worker involved in the caring for AIDS patients, I'm aware of 
the magnitude of the epidemic and the sad and painful result it leaves to its 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
For 10 years we have all been yearning for a cure and fast and caring action 
from our government, but we got too little too late. President Reagan slept 
while the epidemic spread and the number of dead increased. Now President Bush 
had a chance to act and spell out his policies at the international AIDS 
conference in San Francisco, but he refused. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, try visiting an AIDS hospice, sir. Maybe your human values will 
change overnight.

ACTIVIST PRIEST SAYS HE HAS AIDS; DOCTORS BLAME CLINIC'S NEEDLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARITA HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Father Luis Olivares, the activist Roman Catholic priest and long-time champion 
of Central American refugees who had been hospitalized for the past month with 
meningitis, revealed Thursday that he has AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said they believe that he contracted the disease from contaminated 
needles while undergoing treatment for other ailments while traveling in 
Central America. 
</P>
<P>
From his hospital bed at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in West Los Angeles, 
Olivares said he decided to make the nature of his illness public to "let 
people know that anybody can get this disease and not to abandon those who 
happen to get it, regardless of how they contracted it." 
</P>
<P>
Olivares is the controversial pastor of historic Our Lady Queen of Angels 
Church in downtown Los Angeles -- the first church in the Los Angeles 
Archdiocese to declare itself a sanctuary for Central American refugees and 
later for illegal immigrants bypassed by amnesty under the 1986 immigration 
reform law. 
</P>
<P>
Flowers, posters and other expressions of support from his many friends in the 
community crowded his hospital room. A steady stream of visitors included union 
leader Cesar Chavez and actor Martin Sheen. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the day he was released from the hospital, he received expressions 
of support from church superiors. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Archbishop Roger M. Mahony, who visited Olivares 
earlier in the week, voiced sadness about Olivares' illness and admiration for 
his work. 
</P>
<P>
"Father Olivares has served the poorest of the poor here in Los Angeles with 
great commitment and courage, and he has aroused the conscience of us all as we 
try to understand our responsibilities towards newly arrived peoples and those 
whose lives are not sheltered by laws and protections," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Noting that he and Olivares "have approached various social issues with 
different strategies at times," he added that they nevertheless share a 
commitment to "live out the Gospel." 
</P>
<P>
Father John Martens, provincial of the Claretian Order, to which Olivares 
belongs, said simply: "We will love and care for Father Louie. He's our 
brother." 
</P>
<P>
Olivares, who was scheduled later this month to leave the downtown church -- 
known among parishioners as La Placita -- and report to a new parish in Ft. 
Worth, Tex., said Martens has released him from that obligation. Olivares said 
he plans instead to live at a Claretian residential center near Hancock Park. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors said it is impossible to predict how long Olivares will survive. But 
they said that once the illness manifests itself in a serious infection, as it 
has with Olivares, victims generally live from two to six years longer. 
</P>
<P>
"Though it sounds very terminal, I haven't given up," said a frail and 
unusually soft-spoken Olivares. "I have a lot of hope." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Laurence Heifetz, Olivares' primary physician, said the priest has almost 
fully recovered from the meningitis, a bacterial infection that attacks the 
brain and spinal cord. "We expect he'll get back to normal before the next 
manifestation of the HIV (AIDS virus) will hit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Davida Coady, a professor of medicine at UCLA and a personal friend of 
Olivares', said, "We hope he will have several years of active life." 
</P>
<P>
Olivares has traveled numerous times to Central America since 1984 to visit 
refugee camps and to meet with government and church officials. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Coady, an expert on medicine in underdeveloped countries, said she checked 
with several clinics in El Salvador where Olivares had received treatment for 
various minor maladies related to his health problems, including diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
She said she is convinced that the priest was infected with the AIDS virus at a 
clinic six years ago where medication was injected, apparently with 
contaminated needles. Although she declined to provide further details about 
the clinic, citing confidentiality issues, she said she learned that other 
people have been infected with the AIDS virus at the same facility.

SCHOOL BUDGET WOULD TRIGGER LAYOFFS OF 269 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A feuding, frustrated Los Angeles Board of Education on Thursday ground out a 
precariously balanced, tentative budget that triggers 269 layoffs and hinges in 
part on improving student attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the layoffs, part of an overall work force reduction that took about 
1,000 jobs, are among the lower-paying, so-called "classified" jobs -- 
including clerical and other office workers, custodians, maintenance workers 
and cafeteria staff. Many of those jobs are held by blacks, Latinos and other 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been the hardest thing I've ever done since I've been in public 
office," Board President Jackie Goldberg said as the board approved its 
preliminary 1990-91 spending package on a 6-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Golberg noted that up to $120 million more will have to be made by the time a 
final budget is adopted in late August if the governor's proposals to ease the 
state's own financial problems are approved. 
</P>
<P>
In finishing their chore of slicing $220 million -- more than 5% -- from a 
tentative budget of just under $4 billion, the board chopped another $8 million 
from individual school budgets. The amount each school will lose, along with 
whether school community councils can help decide how to spend what is left, 
will be decided later. 
</P>
<P>
The board saved $6.8 million by requiring all non-teaching employees who work 
11 or 12 months of the year to work five days less next year, resulting in pay 
cuts of about 2%. The total pay loss will be as high as 15% for some of those 
employees who were also affected in earlier rounds of budget-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
The board took another $9.8 million from the already hard-hit district 
administrative offices. Robert Booker, the district's chief business and 
financial officer, said he believes that amount can be raised by having the 
schools do a more aggressive job of improving student attendance. The state 
pays districts based on how many students show up for class, so those with low 
attendance rates lose money. 
</P>
<P>
There will be an incentive plan to encourage schools to redouble attendance 
efforts despite shrinking staff and other resources. If attendance can be 
boosted, Booker told dubious board members, it is unlikely that more jobs will 
be lost. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Rita Walters was infuriated by a vote of a majority of board 
members to set aside $500,000 to keep six principals from being replaced by 
administrators with more seniority who will be demoted to save money. Of those 
principals scheduled to be bumped, only those who will head up campuses that 
are moving to school-based management will be spared. Under school-based 
management, most decisions are made by groups at the school instead of district 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no fairness here!" burst out Walters, who felt the funds should have 
gone toward saving the jobs of those workers "who, come Sunday (the start of 
the fiscal year), are out on the street." Walters, who cast the only vote 
against the budget, accused her colleagues of making policies that are 
anti-black. Walters is the only black member of the board. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a vote to add 21 more schools to the list of those getting 
increasingly scarce integration funds that sparked the sharpest clash of the 
long, tense day. 
</P>
<P>
The schools are the latest in the increasingly minority district to reach a 
point at which 70% of their students are Latino, black, Asian or other 
non-Anglos, making them available for special funds to ease the harms of 
segregation. 
</P>
<P>
Walters objected that these schools, many of them in more affluent, suburban 
neighborhoods, would take money away from inner-city "children who need it 
most." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm frankly sick of your making a racial issue out of everything," exclaimed 
San Fernando Valley board member Julie Korenstein, who said many of the 21 
schools have large numbers of inner-city children bused in from crowded schools 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"People who don't know anything should keep their mouths shut," Walters shot 
back. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier rounds of budget cutting, the board saved nearly $1 million by 
freezing the pay of its top 111 administrators, took $8 million in lottery 
funds away from schools and increased some class sizes. It also eliminated the 
district's staff of school physicians and sliced deeply into custodial, 
maintenance and other services, including teacher training. 
</P>
<P>
And in chopping $43 million and 634 jobs from district administration, the 
board set in motion the bumping actions in which those in offices whose jobs 
are cut are sent back to the schools, displacing principals and others with 
less seniority. 
</P>
<P>
The board allowed the layoffs to proceed after a last-ditch attempt to save 
them met with a lukewarm reception. A coalition of black leaders and educators 
on Monday called on all employees to donate 4% of their paychecks next year to 
the district. But on Thursday just three employee groups stepped forward. 
</P>
<P>
Two groups of administrators offered to make the donation if everyone else did, 
and the union that represents about 5,000 office and technical workers said it 
would consider doing so to save the 100 jobs lost in its own group.

<P>
Down to the moment of Nelson Mandela's arrival here, the city of Los Angeles 
will be laboring to purge from its ledgers any connection to the apartheid 
state of South Africa. And yet often in the bouquets the city presents to some 
visiting dignitary -- perhaps even to Mandela himself -- is a bird of paradise 
blossom. It is the official city flower -- and a native of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Like the flamboyantly crested flower, South Africans too have settled into the 
receptive soil of Los Angeles, whose landscape and sunshine are not unlike 
their own. But not all of them have come here willingly, nor with the same 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Black South Africans, estimated to number 200 at most, often find themselves in 
a kind of political exile, committed to the long-distance work of reforming a 
system that locked them out decades ago. Yet they do so without the support 
apparatus of political connections and institutional money that buttress many 
fellow activists in New York and London. 
</P>
<P>
Whites may be as few as 10,000 or more than 25,000; no one knows for sure, not 
even the South African Consulate in Beverly Hills. Apart from rich and 
low-profile South Africans who came here to make money, the rest are not so 
much drawn to Los Angeles as impelled to leave South Africa for reasons less 
obvious than a black emigre escaping apartheid: professional considerations, 
the white-only draft, their own political dissent, fear of violence and social 
chaos, or simple guilt. 
</P>
<P>
KABC radio talk show host Michael Jackson, whose spent his childhood in South 
Africa during World War II, says, "The ones I've heard of, to quote them, got 
the hell out. They saw the writing on the wall." 
</P>
<P>
In a city of so many immigrant settlements, this one is different. 
</P>
<P>
Transplanted South Africans do not jawbone nostalgically in restaurants 
dedicated to home cooking and homeland gossip, nor do they celebrate their 
holidays with rollicking street festivals. Banned from such gatherings at home, 
no tradition of them has developed here. 
</P>
<P>
The profiles of black and white South Africans here are also, understandably, 
quite different. 
</P>
<P>
Among black South Africans, some are professionals -- academicians, writers, 
doctors or film-industry people. About half are students. A few are domestics; 
some years ago, after an outcry when activist blacks found that some whites 
were bringing their domestics with them, the practice was virtually halted. 
</P>
<P>
Among whites, eight in 10 are English-speaking; few Dutch-descended Afrikaners 
come to America. Many are Jews who disapproved of apartheid, and almost all are 
professionals, among them many faculty members at the UCLA School of Medicine 
and staff at its medical center. 
</P>
<P>
It is "quite dispersed. There is no Little Jo'burg," no Johannesburg in 
microcosm, says Mfundi Vlunda, 43, who is black. 
</P>
<P>
Vlunda and his family have lived for two years in North Hollywood, where he 
writes for TV and films. Vlunda, his passport long ago revoked by South Africa, 
is one of the 20 active members in the 5-year-old ANC chapter here. 
</P>
<P>
Common wisdom holds that white emigres still find a lower living standard here 
than they had at home as the privileged race. 
</P>
<P>
"Most college friends are not working nearly as hard as me, and have fancy 
two-level houses with servants and swimming pools (in South Africa)," said 
Bernard Wolfsdorf. He is a white Culver City immigration attorney who got 
political asylum in 1979 as a draft resister who refused to serve in a "police 
state" army. 
</P>
<P>
Emigres can take no more than about $25,000 with them when they leave, but 
people should not "come over here with the concept of making more money," 
Wolfsdorf said. "They come over because they're uncomfortable with the regime; 
their own and their families' futures do not look very good; (or) a combination 
of any sort of pressing factors would do it." 
</P>
<P>
As in South Africa, blacks here do not fare as well financially as whites. 
Students in particular are struggling, says Sipho Nyawo, a doctoral student in 
urban planning at UCLA and head of its multiracial South African International 
Student Congress. Americans are more generous with anti-apartheid rhetoric than 
with scholarships, he said, and some students are all but homeless.

Black or white, South Africans find it hard to shake the shell-shock from life 
in a virtual armed camp. "I grew up with a police complex," admitted one white 
doctor's wife. "People here say, 'Don't be silly, a cop's a cop,' but in South 
Africa that's not the case." 
</P>
<P>
For black activists, too, the suspicions remain -- often with good cause. 
</P>
<P>
"As late as last week, my parents (in South Africa) were visited by the 
police," Nyawo said. "They searched the house. They called my sister again to 
find out when I am coming back. . . . Its purpose is to put pressure on my 
family and (it) says to me, 'You out there. We are watching you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Many white South Africans choose to lie low, whatever their political 
sympathies. "A lot are very conscious about almost hiding their identity and 
integrating," Wolfsdorf said. Several refused to be interviewed, even to 
acknowledge their roots. A white South African active in anti-apartheid causes 
is proud of it -- but she can't bring herself to tell her parents back home. 
</P>
<P>
To acknowledge one's origins is to invite finger-wagging lectures about "you 
people," and some newcomers expunge their statehood along with their accents. 
White emigres "go out of their way to integrate into the American community. . 
. . I have people six months off the boat, and they're already putting on a 
strong American accent," Wolfsdorf said. 
</P>
<P>
Some "feel very guilty about the situation, and many of them have left because 
(of it), and yet they are branded as carriers of apartheid when in fact many of 
them have left what for many was a very comfortable existence because they felt 
ambivalent about it." 
</P>
<P>
Heather Allen, a South African who has traveled the world for NBC News, is now 
bureau chief here and longs to return home one day. "Things are happening so 
fast there that might seem very slow to the rest of the world . . . things I 
thought would never happen in 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
Understanding that requires more patience than Americans demonstrate: "The 
minute they hear you're South African, you need to have every solution, you're 
personally responsible," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
Fashion designer Jocelyn Winship, who is white, said that when she meets 
someone new, "I must admit, if I feel it's not a good time (to acknowledge her 
South African roots), I say another country." 
</P>
<P>
Winship has become friends with activist Mathabo Kunene and her husband, exiled 
ANC member Mazisi Kunene, whose passport was revoked 31 years ago, after he 
went to London, ostensibly as a student but in fact to organize for the ANC. He 
now teaches African literature at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are so separate in South Africa," Winship says. "It's a whole different 
thing here. The Kunenes have become really nice friends of mine and I can go to 
their house for dinner" -- a simple act here, political suicide in South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
But that new-found togetherness only goes so far. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Mathabo Kunene asked a white South African friend to join a protest at 
the consulate. "He said, 'How can I do that? How do you expect me to come over 
there? I still have a lot of money invested in South Africa.' I said, 'If 
you're my friend you'll come, and if that's your attitude, goodby.' " 
</P>
<P>
The man changed his mind and showed up -- but practically in disguise, Kunene 
recalled with a laugh. "He has helped very much since then." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the politics at home, the immediacies of American life must absorb 
emigres too. America feels different, and blacks especially work hard to 
maintain their African identity. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me years before I figured out the landscape," Vlunda said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good feeling to be free of things like being stopped for a pass and 
other such insane things," he said. "It was the first time I had ever gone to 
school with white folks (in Massachusetts), and I was 24 years old. I had one 
friend who was also from South Africa. We were blown away by just the 
educational facilities and the opportunities. We cherished the lack of open and 
overt racial oppression." 
</P>
<P>
Many immigrants only journey home in imagination. Some South Africans, 
especially blacks, intend someday to return to a healed and whole nation. 
Someday. 
</P>
<P>
Said Kunene, away for 31 years: "I will go back one day. I cannot now. I am a 
foot soldier. What is important now is to build up the structures that will 
help others go back first, to help people inside and outside South Africa."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MISTRIAL DECLARED IN TRIAL OF MOTHER FOR 
GIRL'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mistrial has been declared in the case of a Salvadoran woman charged with the 
strangulation death of her 8-year-old daughter, Alba Flores, whose badly beaten 
and smoldering body was discovered in a San Pedro park last year. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors said they were hopelessly deadlocked on manslaughter and sexual 
molestation charges against Natividad Flores. 
</P>
<P>
They acquitted her of murder but found her guilty of a single count of child 
abuse, which carries a maximum sentence of six years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The defendant had confessed to beating and hog-tying the girl in a bathtub an 
hour before her death, and to burning and dumping her body. But jurors said 
they were confused about the degree of her participation in the actual murder. 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Ryan Rainey said he will refile the charges. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's boyfriend, Alejandro Lara, and his brother, Martin Lopez, face 
trial in the death next month.

<P>
How odd -- the mercury's taken a nose dive of nearly 20 degrees in the last two 
days, yet somehow it still seems like summer. 
</P>
<P>
So let's ponder a question raised by the Journal of the Senses, the publication 
of the Elysium nudist colony in Topanga. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously stung by warnings from the medical profession about the harmful 
effects of the sun, the magazine asks: 
</P>
<P>
"A nudist wearing something. Isn't that a contradiction in terms?" 
</P>
<P>
Not any more. 
</P>
<P>
In what may rank as a landmark decision among the birthday-suit crowd, Elysium 
has decreed that a nudist is not compromising his or her principles by wearing 
a hat and/or sunglasses, thongs and sunscreen lotion. 
</P>
<P>
But a wristwatch is still verboten, the magazine said, because it "creates 
hideous tan lines." 
</P>
<P>
There's no water shortage on the front lawn of City Hall. Scores of trash cans 
full of the wet stuff have been set out to restrain the crowds that show up to 
see Nelson Mandela today. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, widely traveled though he is, the anti-apartheid leader will be 
seeing one phenomenon for the first time: The famous Numbered Trees of City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Each large tree bears a numeral painted in white. Officials so daubed them 
after one Dodger celebration there when several fans fell from branches. By 
numbering the trees, the authorities can quickly direct the paramedics to the 
impact spots. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the large number of water barricades, City Hall is taking heed of the 
drought in other ways. After all, the Tom Bradley Fountain outside the New 
Otani Hotel is dry. 
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Norm Nichols' resignation as general manager of the Department 
of Water and Power, two officials who are rumored to be in the running to 
succeed him are the agency's assistant general manager and its chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
Their respective names: 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Waters and Norman Powers. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy Lasorda knows how to shield himself from the sun. He donned a Saudi robe 
during a recent pregame visit by Badr Bakhsh, the director of a Saudi cultural 
exhibition at the L.A. Convention Center. One reporter couldn't help but 
rechristen the Dodger manager Lasorda of Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials don't return reporters' calls. Then there's county Supervisor Ed 
Edelman, who initiates such contacts -- in fact, he even had The Times' 
operator route his call to the home of bleary eyed Only in L.A. on Thursday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman wanted to make sure someone knew: 
</P>
<P>
A day after rivals on the board endangered his political future by proposing a 
new heavily Latino district for him, he hosted the eighth annual Ed Edelman Jr. 
Tennis Clinic in East L.A. 
</P>
<P>
We think it's fine that you're already starting your campaign, Ed. 
</P>
<P>
But next time, just leave a message at work. We promise to call back. 
</P>
<P>

BILL BOYARSKY: DRAWING THE LINES BEHIND CLOSED DOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Executive Session. Doors Locked. No Admittance." 
</P>
<P>
There were no ambiguities on the hand-written sign posted on a door in the Los 
Angeles County Hall of Administration. The county supervisors were meeting 
behind closed doors Wednesday morning for the second day in a row and they 
didn't want outsiders in the room. 
</P>
<P>
Forsaking their big supervisorial chambers, the lawmakers gathered in a 
comparatively small room at the end of a hard-to-find hallway. The hall was 
separated from the main corridor by the locked door. 
</P>
<P>
The supes obviously meant business. They had stationed an armed sheriff's 
deputy by the door to keep people away. The day before, Times reporter Richard 
Simon had been handcuffed briefly by the deputy when he disregarded the 
officer's order and opened the door to ask a question of a supervisor passing 
in the hall. 
</P>
<P>
The privacy seemed to spur productivity. In a couple of hours, the supervisors 
had debated and voted on new district lines that would alter the representation 
of residents throughout the county. They rushed the proposal over to federal 
Judge David Kenyon, who had ruled the old lines violated the Voting Rights Act 
by discriminating against Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't much of a surprise. Everyone knew it was coming. Why, then, the 
locked doors and the deputy? 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors offer a reason. While a state law requires county and city 
governments to have open meetings, it allows officials to meet in private to 
discuss litigation -- lawsuits against the government, condemnation of property 
and other such matters. That's so they can have confidential conferences with 
their attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
County redistricting involves a lawsuit, filed by the U.S. Justice Department. 
Making the broadest possible interpretation, county Counsel Dewitt Clinton has 
told his supervisorial bosses they can discuss almost anything connected with 
that lawsuit behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
When faced with a similar Justice Department suit a few years ago, the Los 
Angeles City Council took an entirely different course. It held public 
hearings. The debate and vote on a redistricting plan was held in an open 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
I asked Supervisor Mike Antonovich why the supervisors didn't do the same. 
Antonovich had joined with fellow conservatives Deane Dana and Pete Schabarum 
to push the plan through. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich explained that he had wanted public hearings, but Judge Kenyon 
didn't give the supervisors enough time to hold them. "The timing of the 
judge's decision precluded public input," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fine. I didn't agree with him, but at least he'd thought out a reason. And he 
and Dana had briefed the press extensively about the new plan. We exchanged 
pleasantries and I went upstairs to a press conference held by the two liberals 
who opposed the plan, Ed Edelman and Kenny Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
There, I found out Antonovich and Dana hadn't told the whole story. Hahn 
revealed that Antonovich, Dana and Schabarum had teamed up at the meeting to 
approve spending $500,000 in public funds to continue the redistricting fight 
all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary. That's on top of the $4 
million the board has already spent. 
</P>
<P>
The appropriation was unusual, to say the least. The supervisors gave Schabarum 
authority to oversee the spending of the $500,000. That authority will continue 
even after he retires from the Board of Supervisors at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
There was a reason for extending Schabarum's life well beyond the political 
grave. Some supervisors told me the conservatives did it because they figure 
Kenyon will reject their latest plan. They're afraid a new board, elected from 
districts drawn by Kenyon, will drop the redistricting fight. Schabarum, armed 
with the half million, can continue the battle. And to make sure a new board 
doesn't rescind the action, the present board approved paying the money now -- 
in a lump sum -- to the Los Angeles law firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; 
Taft. The check went out to the law firm an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a gift of public funds," said Hahn. Absolutely legal, replied county 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
What's certain is that if Hahn hadn't blown the whistle, no outsider would have 
known about the $500,000 expenditure. That's a lot of money to give away behind 
locked doors.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RETIRED STOCKBROKER SENTENCED IN FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A retired stockbroker was sentenced Thursday in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles to two years in prison for defrauding an elderly multimillionaire who 
for years ignored stock accounts worth up to $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Edward Rafeedie also ordered Willard R. Walls Jr. of Huntington Beach to 
return $503,000 to the estate of Everett Reiten, who died last year in 
Wisconsin after spending much of his life in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Walls, 66, was convicted in April of 12 counts of fraud and interstate 
transportation of stolen money for diverting funds from the stock accounts he 
managed for Reiten at Merrill Lynch's Long Beach office. The prosecution 
contended that Walls could not resist the temptation of dipping into Reiten's 
accounts after Reiten returned to Wisconsin and lost touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Walls insisted that he transferred the funds into his accounts to protect 
Reiten's money from seizure by the Internal Revenue Service.

BOY, 5, DIES AFTER BEING FOUND HANGING IN GARAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 5-year-old boy died shortly after he was found hanging Thursday in the garage 
behind his South Los Angeles home, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Gabriel McGee was discovered about 1:35 p.m. by his mother, who had 
gone out to the rear of the family's home in the 5300 block of South 8th 
Street, Los Angeles Police Lt. Fred Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-tall stepladder lay on the floor beneath the child, Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
McGee was rushed to Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, where he was 
pronounced dead, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they are unsure whether the death was a suicide or a homicide. 
</P>
<P>
"All we know is that he climbed the ladder and either stepped off or had the 
ladder pushed," said Lt. Richard Iddings of the LAPD's Child Abuse Unit. 
</P>
<P>
As the boy's family and playmates gathered in the driveway of the home, 
saddened adult neighbors standing on street corners and lawns characterized 
Gabriel as sociable. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a sweet child," said a neighbor who identified herself only as Barbara. 
"He always liked to play with the kids around here and play in the yard." 
</P>
<P>
Dabbing tears from her eyes, she joined a chorus of other neighbors who 
rejected speculation that Gabriel may have killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
"That child ain't climbed no 6-foot ladder," said a girl who claimed to be the 
boy's cousin. "There's just no way he is going to do something like that." 
</P>
<P>
Iddings said the boy's parents were being questioned Thursday by the police, 
but investigators had no suspects.

COUNTY SANITATION OFFICIALS SETTLE TOXIC DUMPING SUIT FOR $12 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Sanitation Districts agreed Thursday to a $12-million 
out-of-court settlement with state and federal authorities over the dumping of 
tons of toxic chemicals into Los Angeles coastal waters that began as far back 
as 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement marked the first time federal and state governments have been 
able to collect damages under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation and Liability Act, which makes parties that dispose of waste 
responsible for cleaning up and restoring the environment, officials connected 
with the case said. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's settlement is an important environmental victory for the people of the 
state," Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, a member of the State Lands Commission, said 
after announcing the decision. "We will not allow our oceans to be treated like 
sewers anymore. American people will no longer experience pollution for the 
sake of profit." 
</P>
<P>
The settlement with the sanitation districts, a Los Angeles County agency, will 
not eliminate legal action against eight companies being sued by the government 
for allegedly inflicting damages to marine wildlife and its habitat off the 
Southern California coast. 
</P>
<P>
Under the settlement guidelines, officials for the plaintiffs will have access 
to the sanitation districts' files documenting dumping by the eight companies 
being sued, said districts spokesman Bob Horvath. 
</P>
<P>
The costs of the Sanitation Districts' settlement will be passed on to 
taxpayers in the from of a service charge increase, Horvath said. The charges, 
currently $50 per year for a single-family home, will most likely increase a 
dollar a year for the next six years, Horvath said. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement, which was filed late Wednesday in federal court, follows a 
warning issued by the government in January that the sanitation districts and 
several California companies could be held liable for environmental damage 
caused by the discharge of the pesticide DDT and polychlorinated biphenyls 
(PCBs). 
</P>
<P>
Scientists say the two chemicals are highly toxic and cause birth defects in 
birds and marine life. The government alleges they were discharged into the Los 
Angeles-Long Beach harbors, the Palos Verdes Shelf off Whites Point and at two 
dump sites in the San Pedro Channel near Santa Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
The sanitation districts agency was named in the lawsuit because it was held 
responsible for releasing through its sewer system the toxic chemicals produced 
by the eight private companies and dumped into Los Angeles-Long Beach waters, 
said Thomas A. Campbell, general counsel for the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, the lead agency in the suit. NOAA, the Interior 
Department and three California state agencies worked together on the 
settlement, Campbell said. The case was filed by the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
The companies named in the suit include Montrose Chemical Corp. and its parent 
companies Atkemix 37 Inc., Stauffeur Management Co., ICI American Holdings and 
Chris-Craft Industries. They are charged with flushing hundreds of tons of DDTs 
into the storm drainage system of Los Angeles County and, ultimately, into the 
Pacific Ocean, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also charges Westinghouse Electric Corp., Potlatch Corp. and Simpson 
Paper Co. with similar activities involving PCBs, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the discharge of the chemicals occurred as long as 40 years ago, 
McCarthy said the effects can be seen today. The dumping made some local fish 
dangerous to eat and threatened the existence of wildlife such as the bald 
eagle and the peregrine falcon, McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
Horvath said the settlement provided a way for the districts to address and 
improve pollution problems as well as the opportunity to shoulder 
responsibility for its actions. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the deal, the districts will assist in assessing the extent of 
natural-resources damage and contribute to restoration of the natural resources 
once a restoration plan is approved. The districts value these services and 
contributions at over $12 million.

DRUG CZAR WILLIAM BENNETT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So Bennett came to California and urged the state Senate to create a bill that 
would re-criminalize marijuana here. Gov. George Deukmejian says if such a bill 
comes to him, he will not hesitate to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
What I would like to know is where do Bennett and Deukmejian plan to put the 
several hundred thousand people who use marijuana when it's time to incarcerate 
them and how do they plan to pay for the law enforcement, court costs and 
prisons? 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has repeatedly cut funds for family planning, education and health 
care yet he thinks California can afford to pay for this absurd notion? I think 
not.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
TAX THAT WON'T SLOW YOU DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Will the passing of another year make a difference in the willingness of Orange 
County voters to tax themselves for important transportation projects? The new 
leadership of the Orange County Transportation Commission believes that it will 
and has made an important decision to try again for authorization to put a 
measure on the ballot in November that would provide a half-cent sales tax 
increase for transportation improvements. 
</P>
<P>
This sentiment arises in part from polling that suggests the voters in tax-wary 
Orange County are ready at long last to pay to improve their own transportation 
system. There also are some signals in what happened to two recent propositions 
in Orange County, 108 for rail bond money and 111 for transportation 
improvements. The first passed here and the second was defeated here, but close 
enough to offer encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County doesn't need more taxes, but it must help itself. For example, 
the county won't qualify for its share of Proposition 108 money unless it 
passes its own sales tax measure, the way other urban counties have. As for 
Proposition 111 money, Orange County shouldn't expect miracles there, either. 
The state decided that it could not afford the entire Santa Ana Freeway 
improvement project and left it to local officials to do the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Without taxing itself for road improvements, Orange county will get half a loaf 
and a long list of unfinished business. The defeat of Measure M last year left 
on hold, for example, the reconstruction of the Santa Ana-San Diego freeway 
interchange, the creation of a 220-mile network of super streets and the 
planned widening of the Riverside and Orange freeways to include new car-pool 
lanes. Most of those projects would get moving again with a new transportation 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
So the estimated $3.1 billion that would come over 20 years from a sales tax 
measure would be money well spent.

SOME HELP AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the streets of Iran, where once there were thousands of Iranian citizens 
chanting slogans such as "America Is the Great Satan" and "Death to America," 
we now find thousands of them suddenly homeless, hungry and dying in the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
We Americans are asked to put our political differences aside and view this 
situation strictly as a humanitarian issue. 
</P>
<P>
I find it difficult to believe that the dispensing of funds and medical 
supplies to Iran could possibly be viewed as anything less than a political 
act. 
</P>
<P>
However, I do believe there is a significant humanitarian issue here that 
should be raised. If there are funds and medical supplies available to be used 
for humanitarian aide, then it should first be used to help the thousands of 
those who are homeless, hungry and dying in the streets of America.

Endorsement: For the first time in its 60-year history, the Nation of Islam is 
fielding candidates for political office, and leader Louis Farrakhan Wednesday 
night urged support for three Muslims in District of Columbia and Maryland 
elections. Addressing 17,000 people at the Washington Convention Center, 
Farrakhan urged embattled D.C. mayor Marion Barry, who was on stage, to put 
aside his earlier decision to not seek reelection.

Barry is on trial for cocaine possession and perjury charges.

The Nose Knows: "My nose must weigh 50 pounds," author Ray Bradbury, 69, said 
as he stared at a 3,000-pound monument in his honor in his hometown of 
Waukegan, Ill. Bradbury, author of "The Martian Chronicles," was in the Chicago 
suburb Tuesday. His bust is the first planned for the town's "Walk of Stars," 
which will also honor comedian Jack Benny.

Name That Toon: He doesn't wear a yellow raincoat or a two-way radio wrist 
radio, but Chicago police Capt. Dick Tracy is still real. "I never claimed to 
be the Dick Tracy," he says of the comic strip character now played on screen 
by Warren Beatty. Though Richard Joseph Tracy, 56, now handles the department's 
duplication services, he once worked undercover. He was told that prisoners 
"were actually joking or bragging about being arrested by Dick Tracy."

'SHIFTING GEARS' ON BICYCLES, MOTORCYCLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Congratulations on the great article regarding the trend toward alternate 
transportation methods as a way of beating traffic ("Shifting Gears," June 19). 
It was nice to see coverage of a growing change in commuter attitude, 
especially when we in Southern California are faced with a serious and growing 
crisis in transportation. 
</P>
<P>
My own personal experience with alternative transportation began last summer 
when my car broke down. I began riding my bike from my home in Pacific Beach to 
my job tending bar in La Jolla, five miles each way. Even after I got my car 
repaired, I continued to ride my bike to work simply because I enjoyed it. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, I am riding my bike to my job at Caltrans in Old Town, another 
five-mile ride each way. The ride past Mission Bay at 7:30 in the morning is 
beautiful and an important start to my day. 
</P>
<P>
When school begins this fall, I plan on riding to the campus, 15 miles from 
home. Sure it takes a little longer, but the workout alone is worth it. 
Besides, driving to San Diego State to study for a master's degree in 
conservation of environmental quality does not make sense.

'SHIFTING GEARS' ON BICYCLES, MOTORCYCLES

<TEXT>
<P>
Not many people are up to making a long commute by bicycle; few people work 
close enough to home to walk to work, and roller skating is an amusing idea but 
not likely to make much of a dent in the problem. However, with proper 
training, a person in average condition can become a safe, defensive motorcycle 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
An average motorcycle gets approximately 50 miles per gallon, so commuting by 
motorcycle saves as much gas as two or three people car-pooling in an average 
car. Two people sharing a cycle commute doubles the fuel savings. Cycles also 
take up much less space on roads and in parking lots than do cars. 
</P>
<P>
Although I don't own a motorcycle, I have several friends who use them as their 
primary means of transportation, including commuting to professional jobs. And 
I feel much less vulnerable as a passenger on a motorcycle than I would trying 
to make my way through hostile, rush hour traffic on a 10-speed.

SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON DIETITIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I agreed with all but one word of Lee Dembart's review of the Ralph W. Moss 
book, "The Cancer Industry: Unravelling the Politics" (June 5). That single, 
inaccurate word was "dietitians," being used so out of context in association 
with Laetrilists, vitamin advocates and believers in the power of positive 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Dembart meant "nutritionists," a word that has no legal meaning. 
Anyone, including health food store clerks, Nutri-System counselors, sports 
trainers, Herbalife distributors or even your grandmother, can call themselves 
a nutritionist. 
</P>
<P>
The word "dietitian" is protected by the Title Act under the California 
Business and Professions Code to refer only to Registered Dietitians (R.D.). 
R.D.'s are recognized by the medical profession as the legitimate providers of 
nutrition care. We have a minimum of four years of specialized study, including 
a bachelor's degree at an accredited college or university, extensive work 
experience, a national board exam and continuing education requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Registered dietitians work in settings such as hospitals, wellness centers, 
corporate food management systems and health departments, and many are in 
private practice. If you, as a cancer patient, were referred to a R.D., you 
would get a practical, scientifically sound, individualized plan for how to 
deal with such common cancer treatment-related problems as loss of appetite and 
weight, nausea, taste abnormalities, malabsorption, diarrhea, difficulty 
swallowing and so on. You would not be sold vitamin megadoses or Laetrile.

INTO THE NIGHT: COFFEE BREAK WITH THE MAD HATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: A fund-raiser for the Mad Hatter espresso coffee bar/performance 
club at another coffeehouse, Highland Grounds. Proceeds are to help the 
now-closed Hatter upgrade to meet city building regulations. 
</P>
<P>
(The 20-year-old owners of the Hatter "didn't go the permit route" when they 
opened eight months ago, said benefit organizer Mariette Peeters.) 
</P>
<P>
Who was there: About 150 guests, most in their late teens and early 20s; Mad 
Hatter owners Steve Harris and Jasan Radford; 27 performers, including folk 
singers, poets, comedians and performance artists, plus two bands. No celebs 
were in the crowd, although Chuck Forest, the all-time high ($172,800) 
"Jeopardy" winner, was on hand. "All over the world they ask the same 
question," said Forest, who just quit a State Department job in the Middle East 
to appear on the game show again. " 'What is Alex Trebek really like?' It 
drives you crazy." The Buzz: Downright caffeinated on the subject of 
coffeehouses as a major '90s trend. They're cheaper than restaurants and a 
rebellion to the Reagan years, say aficionados. "All revolutions start in 
coffeehouses," said Highland Grounds co-owner Tom Kaplan. But his partner 
Richard Brenner cautioned, "It's a business, not a home for the wayward." 
</P>
<P>
Dress Mode: Post-punk-Dylanesque-neo-surfer -- as on a folk singer with a rad 
tan in a Guatemalan vest with torn Levis. Teen-age Bohemians don't necessarily 
wear black. 
</P>
<P>
Money Matters: Tickets were $20, and $1,500 was raised for the white paint, 
linoleum and plumbing the Mad Hatter needs to reopen. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: "I love the '90s" said comedian Taylor Negron. "There's no sex, no 
drinking, all they have is coffee. It's going to be very Edwardian. It's going 
to be pinkies touching at tea."

Not content to be merely versatile, Melissa Lentricchia reaches for 
ventriloquism in her first collection of short fiction. The result is a 
one-woman anthology of 10 stories so varied in style and tone that each seems 
an experiment; only "Relatives" and "A Love Story in One Act" having anything 
in common. Both these stories happen in an Italian-American milieu, an 
atmosphere in which the author seems both at home and at ease. 
</P>
<P>
"Relatives" is told in the altogether authentic voice of a homosexual family 
member, re-creating his all-too-brief love affair with a distant cousin. While 
the narrator is secure and accepted by his relations, his lover is "Lucky" in 
name only, still tormented by a mother who calls on holidays "to say things 
like, 'Happy New Year from the mother you killed.' " Satiric and poignant by 
turns, "Relatives" is an altogether original take on a newly classic theme. In 
"A Love Story," the projected voice is raucously, hilariously female, an 
amateur opera singer's sweetie vamping the cop who investigates a suspicious 
accident involving the singer's archenemy -- the critic who savages his 
performances and his avoirdupois. 
</P>
<P>
"The Golden Robe" takes place in the mind of a Mexican woman working as a maid 
in Marina del Rey. Here the mood is a heady mix of pathos and melodrama; areas 
notoriously difficult to negotiate successfully. "Red Horse Running Through 
Water" presents the mysterious tale of the death of Raymond White Eagle. This 
time Lentricchia has adopted a kind of Indian syntax: "On the first night Jack 
began at what he thought was the beginning that would carry him straight and 
smooth to the end. . . ." This counterproductive exercise turns a solemn and 
mournful story into a Hemingway parody. "No-Chickens-to-Count-Blues" is offered 
as an "anti-fable," a curious category in which the moral remains permanently 
elusive. 
</P>
<P>
"Wandalinda" is a physical therapist who runs away with Gypsies to become a 
palm reader, a discipline for which she has a truly amazing aptitude. Until 
recently plain Linda Miller, this character is one of the author's most 
felicitous creations. "From You Know Who" explores the dark underside of 
country life from the point of view of an aged and vindictive spinster. Here 
the characters are not only remarkable but believable, leaving the reader 
dazzled and disconcerted. Striving for a similarly chilling effect, "Some 
Enchanted Evening" undermines itself by beginning with its end, thus depriving 
the story of a crucial element of suspense. "Ole' Henry" introduces us to a 
woman academic obsessed with Henry James. You have to sympathize with a 
character whose "thing with Henry began in medias res, when soon-to-be Gloria 
was more or less in graduate school at NYU, verging virginally on 30, going by 
the name of Ricky or sometimes Rickety, her hair wild, red, her clothes 
ranch-style bohemian, her demeanor incognito and incommunicado, her essays all 
in one way or another about the fleetingness of phallic images." A writer who 
realizes that a monograph by a Ricky on James would be a mistake must be on the 
right track, if she'll only stick to it. 
</P>
<P>
Previously published in small literary magazines, these stories are clearly the 
work of an author diligently exploring style and form in an attempt to discover 
the mode that suits her best. In the Italian ethnic pieces and her excursions 
into the hearts of society's female rebels, she seems to have found precisely 
what she's seeking.

Question: If a woman has a genital herpes infection, does that mean she is more 
likely to get genital cancer? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Infection with the herpes simplex virus does appear to be associated 
with the development of genital cancer in women; however, this does not 
necessarily mean there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the two 
events. Some authorities attribute the development of genital cancer in these 
women to the risk of frequent sexual activity.

Van Gogh Theft: Thieves smashed a museum window in Den Bosch, the Netherlands, 
on Thursday and made off with three Vincent van Gogh paintings worth up to $5.4 
million. The museum's alarm system, described as fail-safe, did not go off. 
</P>
<P>
The thieves jumped fences and broke the ground-floor window of the gallery 
where the paintings were hanging, officials said. Stolen were "The Sitting 
Farmer's Wife," "The Digging Farmer's Wife" and "Wheels of the Water Mill in 
Gennep." Van Gogh painted them while living in what is now the town of Nuenen, 
18 miles from the museum.It was the third time in 18 months that paintings by 
the Dutch impressionist had been stolen from museums in the Netherlands. GREG

Curtain Falls Again on 'A Chorus Line': Despite generally favorable reviews, 
the revamped version of "A Chorus Line" that opened at the Las Palmas Theatre 
in May will close July 8. Representatives of the production, which opened right 
after the closing of the show in New York on Broadway, said that fitting the 
musical into the 392-seat Hollywood theater was part of Michael Bennett's 
vision of bringing the show back to a smaller venue. 
</P>
<P>
"But that proved to be the downfall because of the size and scale of the 
production," said spokesperson Kim Garfield. It became too expensive to run a 
show with a 23-member cast, 10-piece orchestra and crew of 20. Garfield added 
that the royalties for the musical are among the highest in history, and that 
crowds had been decreasing since the first month. "We had hoped the show would 
run forever," Garfield said. GREG BRAXTON

A MONUMENTAL 'HUMAN CONDITION' RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Masaki Kobayashi's near-10-hour, three-part "Human Condition" ("Ningen No 
Joken") trilogy is one of the monumental achievements in motion-picture 
history. It is also one of the most obscure, for the trilogy -- "No Greater 
Love," "Road to Eternity" and "A Soldier's Prayer" -- suffered from poor 
international distribution upon its completion in 1961. Having regained its 
rights to "The Human Condition," the venerable Shochiku Film Co. presented it 
at the old Kabuki Theater on Adams at Crenshaw in 1970. Now, 20 years later, 
"The Human Condition" returns today to the Little Tokyo Cinemas. 
</P>
<P>
It is stupendous not only as a kind of ultimate indictment of man's inhumanity 
to man but is also virtually unique as a massive reminder of a defeated 
nation's folly and evil to itself, comparable in scope and impact to Claude 
Lanzmann's death camp documentary "Shoah." 
</P>
<P>
"No Greater Love" finds Kobayashi struggling to get a handle on Jumpei 
Gomikawa's six-volume best seller, but he ultimately succeeds in launching his 
hero on his grim odyssey so that we may perceive the tragedy of an entire 
nation through the story of one man. He is a naive pacifist and intellectual 
named Kaji (Tatsuya Nakadai) employed at a steel company in Japanese-occupied 
Southern Manchuria who inadvertently ends up helping run a concentration camp 
and finally fighting on the front lines in a losing battle. 
</P>
<P>
In "Road to Eternity," Kaji, now immersed in brutal basic training, emerges as 
a man of strength and compassion whose intelligence and sanity mirrors the 
mounting madness all about him. In the concluding "A Soldier's Prayer," Kaji 
moves way beyond resolute idealist to resilient soldier and leader to a man 
brought to the level of an animal in the struggle for survival before being 
transformed into a Christ-like martyr. 
</P>
<P>
One of the world cinema's great anti-war dramas, "The Human Condition" trilogy 
is bleak and eloquent, its tendencies toward the melodramatic and didactic 
sustained by Kobayashi's depth of passion and breadth of vision, yielding 
finally the catharsis of tragedy. Schedule: (213) 687-7077.

JAZZ NOTES: CELEBRATING 'SATCHMO' ON THE FOURTH OF JULY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For most Americans, the Fourth of July means celebrating the birth of our 
country, fireworks, hot dogs and burgers cooked by Dad on the barbecue and, 
these days, remembrance of the Vietnam War due to Oliver Stone's movie "Born on 
the Fourth of July." 
</P>
<P>
To jazz lovers, the Fourth has another special meaning: it's the birthday of 
Louis Armstrong, the grandfather of jazz trumpet who brought his chosen music 
to fans all over the world. "Pops," who died July 6, 1971, would have been 90 
on Wednesday -- July 4, 1900, a perfect birth date for the first true genius of 
America's indigenous art form. 
</P>
<P>
To honor "Satchmo," National Public Radio will present a special two-part 
program, "Louis Armstrong: The First Ninety Years." The first segment, the 
two-hour "The Kid From Algiers," is a collage of musical selections -- "West 
End Blues," "Weather Bird," et al. -- and interviews with the likes of 
trumpeter Wynton Marsalis and jazz critic Martin Williams hosted by pianist 
Billy Taylor. It airs Wednesday on KPCC (89.3 FM), noon-2 p.m., and on KCRW 
(89.9 FM), 3-5 p.m. The program's second segment, "The Second Line," hosted by 
actor Ozzie Davis and featuring musical tributes to Armstrong as well as 
interviews with his former bassist, Arvell Shaw, among others, airs solely on 
KPCC, 2-3 p.m. Also on KPCC, Isabel Holt precedes the NPR broadcast with a 
three-hour salute to "Pops," 9 a.m.-noon.

SUBRAMANIAM IN BENEFIT: The noted Indian jazz and classical violinist, L. 
Subramaniam, joins forces with saxophonist Ernie Watts and others to play a 
benefit for Polio Plus and the Buena Park Rotary Club, Sunday, at the La Mirada 
Civic Theatre, 14900 La Mirada Blvd., La Mirada. The evening of contemporary 
jazz/fusion will begin at 6:30 p.m. Information: (714) 994-6310.

WOODS WORDS TO THE WISE: Phil Woods, the revered alto saxophonist who arrives 
at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill in Hollywood for a weeklong stand on July 10, is 
well known for his outspoken attitudes about jazz. In a recent issue of "The 
Note," a newsletter published by the Al Cohn Memorial Jazz Collection, Woods 
had these words to say about the state of mainstream jazz in this country: 
"Jazz remains at the bottom of the totem pole in terms of support, and this 
support must begin at the local level . . . This music needs to be nourished . 
. . attendance needs to be better at (jazz) venues. Come on, fans. Get up off 
it. You can always tape Connie Chung. Get your buns down to a club. We need the 
bread! Bold innkeepers deserve our support." By the way, the newsletter is 
available from East Stroudsburg University, Music Department, East Stroudsburg, 
Pa. 18301.

POP CAPSULES : SAVATAGE: MUSICALITY IN THE THRASHINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a field crowded with cookie-cutter metal bands, at least give Savatage 
credit for appearing to have been formed with a jagged can lid. At Anaheim's 
Bandstand club on Wednesday, the quintet played with an intensity (somewhere 
between Motorhead and Canada's Nomeansno) and modicum of originality that set 
it apart. 
</P>
<P>
Though singer Jon Oliva seems to have bought his voice down at Ed's Screech 'n' 
Growl and the rest of the group had the amps set on "pummel," there was a 
distinctive musicality to their thrashings. Guitarists Criss Oliva and 
Christopher Caffery churned up some heaving dissonances that would have done 
noise artist Glenn Branca proud. 
</P>
<P>
Lyrically, Savatage (which headlines the Palace tonight) falls pretty much in 
the post-apocalyptic doom school, though Wednesday the words were chiefly lost 
in the tumult and an awful sound mix. It's scarcely ironic then that during the 
anti-violence "Of Rage and War" the group's slam-dancing fans and the club's 
bouncers were engaged in a limited ground war of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Second-billed Cold Sweat delivered a pandering, rote-rock set capped by a 
version of "I Just Want to Make Love to You" that sounded as if Foghat was its 
idea of roots. JIM WASHBURN

POP CAPSULES : BAERWALD WASTES NO TIME AT THE ROXY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Forget about 3-D. One D, singer-songwriter David Baerwald, was all it took 
Wednesday at the Roxy to give an arresting musical portrait of the cracks in 
Los Angeles' social sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
Supporting his solo debut album, "Bedtime Stories," Baerwald matched the level 
he and ex-partner David Ricketts attained as David + David on the same stage in 
1986, when their songs took on a dimension only hinted at in the duo's lone 
album, the fine "Boomtown." 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's show featured the vivid imagery of a Joni Mitchell and the burning 
intensity of a Sean Penn (both pals of Baerwald's who were among the 
enthusiastic crowd). Baerwald didn't waste any time showing that he was willing 
and able to stand up to his past, starting with "Boomtown," the most 
recognizable number in his catalogue, followed by "Liberty Lies," one of the 
best songs from his new album. 
</P>
<P>
Where many artists would have saved a one-two punch like that for a concert's 
climax, Baerwald used it as a tone-setter. From there, the show just built in 
intensity, his strong band gaining force and depth with each number, through 
the frenzied conclusion of the bitter "Dance" and an unrecorded smoker titled 
"Under Pressure" (both featuring the Tower of Power horn section). 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't just the band that fleshed out the songs. In this setting what 
came through was how much Baerwald himself is part of the world he surveys, not 
just an observer of it. His anger and confusion -- and just as often his 
tenderness and yearning -- are personal, not just tools he uses as a writer and 
performer. STEVE HOCHMAN

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: SPIRO AGNEW WOULD LOVE SANTA MONICA'S CAFE ATHENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Cafe Athens is a '90s version of a Greek family restaurant. Instead of cramming 
its walls with black-and-white glossies of the owner's favorite Greek 
celebrities, Cafe Athens art-directed its Greek pride: Along the top of one 
wall you see the names CASSAVETES . . . DUKAKIS . . . STAMOS in bold teal 
letters; larger-than life, teal-tinted photos of other famous Greeks and 
Greek-Americans (of course, Maria Callas) appear around the room. 
</P>
<P>
(On the menu, there's a picture of Spiro Agnew at a White House press 
conference.) 
</P>
<P>
The food -- stuffed grape leaves, spanakopita and lobster linguine! -- is more 
professionally done (and less homey) than your average Greek family restaurant. 
The prices are higher than what a Greek mama would charge, too. 
</P>
<P>
But some things never change in a Greek restaurant: 
</P>
<P>
Can't find your waiter? That might be him with his fellow waiters in the middle 
of the dining room -- singing, dancing, dragging you away from your flaming 
cheese appetizer to line dance. And if you're concerned about getting your next 
course, don't worry, he can spin, dip and clear your plate in one graceful 
motion. 
</P>

ON THE WATERFRONT: NIMBLE-FINGERED SOUTHLAND SEAMEN TEACH STUDENTS THE ROPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEARLEAN DUKE, Shearlean Duke is a regular contributor to Orange County 
Life.

<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Smirl specializes in knots, lashings and whippings. But don't get the 
wrong idea. Smirl is not a specialist in mayhem; he's a seaman who can tie 
hundreds of sailorly knots and whip a raggedy line into shape faster than you 
can say "marlinespike." 
</P>
<P>
Knots, lashings, whippings, splices, seizings and other things you can do with 
rope are Smirl's specialties. He is one of only a handful of traditional 
marlinespike seamen in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, a marlinespike is a small metal tool used to separate strands of 
rope or wire, but in the world of boating, marlinespike is used to describe the 
entire process of working with rope. 
</P>
<P>
As every boater knows, as soon as you buy a boat -- either power or sail -- 
rope becomes very important. You use it to tie your boat to the dock, to hoist 
a flag, to tow another vessel, to raise a sail. And in some cases, you can even 
use it to save your life, like the famous sailor Steven Callahan did when he 
was lost at sea for 76 days and used lines and lashings to repair his ruptured 
life raft. 
</P>
<P>
Rope, which aboard ship goes by different names depending upon its uses, is an 
essential part of a seafarer's life, and it has been a part of Smirl's life for 
the past 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
Smirl, a 44-year-old high school English teacher, has been working with 
marlinespike since he bought his first copy of the "Marlinspike Sailor" when he 
was 16. Since then, he has taught marlinespike seamanship at Saddleback College 
and currently is teaching a course at Orange Coast College. Every summer, when 
he isn't teaching, he works as the first mate on the Pilgrim II in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1979 I read an article about the Pilgrim," says Smirl, who lives in nearby 
San Clemente. "So I went down and volunteered. They were surprised to find out 
how my marlinespike skills could be used on the Pilgrim. I found myself 
splicing lines and so on. Pretty soon, I came on board as the rigger." 
</P>
<P>
Smirl, who describes himself as a traditional marlinespike seaman, says the 
Pilgrim has been his "mentor" and is constantly teaching him new things -- 
which he then passes along to his students. "For my Orange Coast College class 
we had a turn-away crowd," he says. "I have 30 students, which is large for a 
hands-on class like this." 
</P>
<P>
Smirl hopes that the size of his current class is evidence of an increased 
interest in rope work. "We have reached a point in modern boating where you go 
buy a dock line in a marine store all made up," he says. "There is no reason to 
learn the sailorly skills. Most people don't know how to whip (a line), and 
they usually only know seven or eight knots. When they take my class, I teach 
them over 100 knots. And I teach them a lot of the folklore along with the 
knots." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Smirl even dresses in clothing of the type worn by a 19th-Century 
whaler. "Many of the whalers were the best at marlinespike because they were at 
sea so long, three or four years, and had access to lots of junk line," he 
says. "So they would unravel it and reweave it into rope or twine that could be 
used in other marlinespike applications." 
</P>
<P>
During idle hours, such sailors would use their marlinespike skills to fashion 
decorative rope work for wives and sweethearts back home. "Macrame, which was 
popular in the 60s, is a spinoff of the sailorly art," Smirl says. 
</P>
<P>
Although Smirl's class deals more with traditional, practical applications, 
including how to make your own dock lines, another Orange County marlinespike 
seaman teaches the decorative skills. 
</P>
<P>
John Magness, former first officer on the Queen Mary in Long Beach, began 
teaching a seven-week class June 28 at Golden West College. Magness, 66, first 
began working with ropes in the Navy in 1945 when he was stationed aboard the 
destroyer Phelps. "It was toward the end of World War II," he says, "and one of 
the other mates knew quite a bit about the art and taught it to me." 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Magness will teach his students how to make a "snowflake" 
out of one-eighth-inch line. Tying the lacy, decorative snowflake takes Magness 
five hours. To make a simple snowflake, you have to start with about 80 feet of 
line, Magness says. "By the time you tie it down, you've got about 65 feet of 
line in it." 
</P>

John Needham, writer, and Scott Brown, graphic artist, are an incredible team! 
They produced not only the quintessential article on the back bay, which they 
were striving to do, but a magnificent work of art as well. On behalf of all 
the friends of Newport Bay and the bay's varied inhabitants, thank you, The

'A' STREET WAR: NEIGHBORS AND NEUTRALITY ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unbelievable! I just finished reading "The War on 'A' Street" (Life section, 
June 15). Are the residents of that area upset because babies are being 
destroyed in the nearby Doctors Family Planning Clinic? Oh no, they are upset 
because caring Christians, at great personal risk, are there to rescue babies 
and -- God forbid! -- they might see a picture of an aborted fetus. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents do want the clinic to move. But is the reason because of baby 
killing? No, they don't like the inconveniences the Operation Rescue protests 
have caused. Unbelievable! 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, I have to admit that this neighborhood may very well exemplify the 
attitude of most Americans: Don't show or tell me what goes on during an 
abortion; I don't care. If it doesn't directly affect my life, it's not 
important. Ignorance is bliss. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure glad I don't live in that neighborhood. I wouldn't want an abortion 
center near me, nor would I want those people as my neighbors.

E. GERMANS FACING FUTURE WITH EXHILARATION, FEAR 
</P>

RUEDERSDORF, East Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was an hour after official closing time for the town's only bank, yet 14 
weary souls waited quietly in the cheap fluorescent glare as the lone teller 
labored on. 
</P>
<P>
In calmer times, everyone here would have long since been home, the bank's 
manager, Martina Bengsch, admitted, and she would occasionally see her infant 
daughter before she went to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
But for East Germany, these are not calm times. 
</P>
<P>
In this gray industrial town 20 miles east of Berlin, as elsewhere in the 
country, the ritual of standing for hours in a seemingly endless line to open 
new accounts is part of a precarious balancing act of family finances in the 
run-up to Sunday's scheduled union of the East and West German currency. 
</P>
<P>
In the coming months, jobs will disappear, taxes will jump, pensions will rise, 
grocery bills and rents will rocket while salaries remain a giant question mark 
in a disorienting flurry of change. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, what economists regard as a first-of-its-kind experiment in what 
happens when a former Communist country gets one of the West's premier 
currencies, and what politicians view as the first step to German unity, has 
become, above all, a powerful personal drama for the people of East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
It is a moment when the lives of an entire nation are about to be turned upside 
down, when the only certainty is uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
For a people subjected over four decades to Eastern Europe's most carefully 
programmed Stalinist society, it is an unsettling, yet perversely exhilarating 
experience. It is also a moment of truth for each of those who helped build 
what was arguably the most remarkable of all the revolutions to sweep through 
Eastern Europe last fall: Can they make it in a free, open world? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is as crucial for Germany and for Europe as it is for Martina 
Bengsch and her customers. 
</P>
<P>
"If the experiment succeeds . . . then it's not just a victory for East Germany 
. . . but also an encouraging example for the other East European countries," 
noted Hans Tietmeyer, a director of the West German Bundesbank and a key 
architect of the currency union. 
</P>
<P>
If the East Germans, with massive assistance from West Germany and their own 
inherent industrial discipline, fail to make the transition from Communist to 
free market society, then the future for the rest of Eastern Europe looks 
bleak, diplomats and other analysts in both Germanys believe 
</P>
<P>
The change will be painful. 
</P>
<P>
From wages that are already less than half West German levels, East Germans 
will, by the start of next year, give up hefty bites of between 19% and 53% for 
the previously unknown Western practice of personal income tax. Social security 
and health payments will also rise. 
</P>
<P>
There is talk of increasing wages and salaries to compensate, but no one knows 
how, when or by how much. 
</P>
<P>
East Berlin garbage collectors this week threatened to strike over their demand 
for a 60% wage increase. Such a strike could trigger an avalanche of industrial 
unrest, said city government spokesman Klaus Hetzel. 
</P>
<P>
Low rents and subsidized services that characterized the Communist command 
economies will also go, but few understand what will come in their place. 
Jacqueline Nun, a 28-year-old East Berlin office cleaner, for example, said she 
had been told the $38 monthly rent on her small public housing apartment would 
be frozen through the end of the year, but then be quadrupled before the end of 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
Also, she has no idea what will become of the $156 state subsidy she gets as a 
single parent for her two children or if the child-care center to which she 
pays $2.50 a month for each child will be closed as uneconomic. Both are 
critical to her financial survival, but she has found little real information. 
</P>
<P>
"There are rumors the child-care center will be closed, but nobody really knows 
anything," she said, her eyes welling with tears of frustration. "How am I 
supposed to plan for a family under such conditions?" 
</P>
<P>
Under the currency union, pensions will rise by an average of about 11%, but 
for pensioners as for everyone, the heavily subsidized 7-cent pound of flour, 
10-cent pound of sugar and baby food for a dime a jar will also disappear. A 
loaf of rye bread that costs 33 cents in Dresden today will cost more than $2 
Monday morning. As a consequence, such staples that can be frozen or stored 
have been swept from the shelves by eager buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The family budget is only one of the many unknowns for which a disoriented East 
German bureaucracy has few answers. 
</P>
<P>
For millions of East Germans raised in the belief that access to a job was a 
right, it has become a distinct possibility that a quarter of the work force 
may be out of work by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
At East Berlin's prestigious Humboldt University, history professor Steffi 
Gloess says the 60-member department may be cut in half. 
</P>
<P>
Internal East German government studies indicate that between one-fifth and 
one-quarter of the country's obsolete, over-manned industry may go under 
immediately in the face of Western competition. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no such thing as a secure job now," said Deitmar Seelig, 32, who has 
already quit his old job as an engineer in a factory with an uncertain future. 
He is studying to get in on the ground floor of a growth industry in East 
Germany: tax consulting. 
</P>
<P>
Others worry that their homes, confiscated by the Communists from former West 
German property owners decades ago and handed over to East Germans, may be 
taken away. 
</P>
<P>
Bank manager Bengsch's family home for the last 25 years is one of up to 1 
million such cases in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, these homes were seized illegally, but 25 years of upkeep, care and 
remodeling has to count for something," she argued. "The lawyers and the courts 
will be booked up for the next 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite such personal worries about homes, jobs and salaries, there is no 
visible panic. On the eve of the great experiment, a perceptible, yet tenuous 
optimism prevails. 
</P>
<P>
In its own unspoken way, this collective leap into the unknown has somehow 
bound together the 16 million people of East Germany with a sense of common 
destiny that doesn't exist in richer, more individualistic West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
It has bred a solidarity that leads Bengsch to close but not lock the bank's 
door at the normal closing time and then to let in anyone who knocks. The 
sickening fear expressed frequently among East Germans that -- for them and 
their country -- life could be very bad for a while, is held in check by the 
oft-repeated comment, "It can only get better for us, because it can't get 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
To an outsider, this optimism occasionally seems unrealistic: Such is the case 
with a shopkeeper here whose upbeat mood did not reflect the fact that he faces 
immediate eviction because the premises have been bought by a West German and 
he has few prospects of relocating in a decent area. 
</P>
<P>
But for those who have lived their entire lives as second-class Germans, 
Sunday's currency union means much more than getting the deutschemark. 
</P>
<P>
With it comes a freedom of choice, of travel and a new self-respect that is 
hard to understand for those who have never listened to East Germans dream of 
impossible journeys or seen East German couples refused tables at restaurants 
in their own country only to watch West Germans with hard currency be seated in 
their place. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy for my daughter, that she can buy things, that she doesn't have to 
be humiliated by our relatives from the West," said a sales assistant at the 
East Berlinfurniture store Wohnkultur, who identified herself only as Heide. 
"The constant 'Thank you very much' for a piece of (Western) chocolate was 
humiliating. We were basically second-class human beings." 
</P>
<P>
Poor quality goods, endless shortages and waiting impose their own degradation 
that they see the deutschemark and the free market bringing to an end. 
</P>
<P>
Those who had waited an hour in the rain just to get inside a local supermarket 
here expressed that hope. Although the store was far from full, no one was 
allowed in without a shopping cart and carts were in short supply. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a hundred in the basement with broken wheels but where are we supposed 
to get new wheels?" asked the store's assistant manager, Gabrielle Knobel, with 
a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
And so, in hopes of leaving such dilemmas to a bygone age, some East Germans 
will celebrate Saturday night in their own way, taking advantage of a large 
party being advertised on posters in East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
"Dance in the D-mark," the posters say. "The ostmark is valid until the end."

ON THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST AN ARRAY OF SUSPECTED FOES 
</P>

"Never treat a war like a skirmish. Treat all skirmishes like wars." 
</P>
<P>
 -- L. Ron Hubbard 
</P>
<P>
The Church of Scientology does not turn the other cheek. 
</P>
<P>
Ministers mingle with private detectives. "Sacred scriptures" counsel the 
virtues of combativeness. Parishioners double as paralegals for litigious 
church attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the passage that a prominent Scientology minister selected from the 
religion's scriptures, authored by the late L. Ron Hubbard, to inspire the 
faithful during a gala church event. 
</P>
<P>
"People attack Scientology," the minister quoted Hubbard as saying. "I never 
forget it; always even the score." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd cheered. 
</P>
<P>
As far back as 1959, Hubbard warned that illness and even death can befall 
those seeking to impede Scientology, known within the church as "suppressive 
persons." 
</P>
<P>
"Literally, it kills them," Hubbard wrote, "and if you don't believe me I can 
show you the long death list." 
</P>
<P>
He told the story of an electrician who bilked the organization. "Within a few 
weeks," Hubbard said, "he contracted TB." 
</P>
<P>
Scientology seems committed not only to fighting back, but to chilling 
potential opposition. For years, the church has been accused of employing 
psychological warfare, dirty tricks and harassment-by-lawsuit to silence its 
adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
The church has spent millions to investigate and sue writers, government 
officials, disaffected ex-members and others loosely defined as "enemies." 
</P>
<P>
Teams of private detectives have been dispatched to the far corners of the 
world to spy on critics and rummage through their personal lives -- and trash 
cans -- for information to discredit them. 
</P>
<P>
During one investigation, headed by a former Los Angeles police sergeant, the 
church paid tens of thousands of dollars to reputed organized crime figures and 
con men for information linking a leading church opponent to a crime that it 
turned out he did not commit. 
</P>
<P>
Early last year, an American Scientologist was arrested in Spain for possessing 
dossiers containing confidential information on a member of Parliament and a 
Madrid judge who is oversaw a fraud and tax evasion probe of the church. The 
dossiers included personal bank records and family photographs, according to 
press accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Before a British author's critical biography of Hubbard was even released two 
years ago in Europe, the church had him and his publisher tied up in a London 
court for alleged copyright infringement. The writer speculated that 
Scientology sympathizers had somehow managed to obtain pre-publication proofs 
of the book. 
</P>
<P>
Scientology spokesmen insist that the organization is doing nothing illegal or 
unethical, and is merely exercising its constitutional rights with vigor. 
</P>
<P>
They argue that Scientology has been targeted by hostile government and private 
forces -- including the Internal Revenue Service, the FBI, the press, 
psychiatrists and unscrupulous attorneys -- that have persecuted the church 
since its founding three decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of self-preservation, lamented Scientology attorney Earle C. 
Cooley, the church has been forced to fight back and then has been unfairly 
chastised for its aggressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were attacked at Pearl Harbor we didn't just sit back and defend 
there," Cooley declared. "We tried to get out on the offensive as quickly as 
possible. . . . To sit back and ward off the blows is ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Underlying the church's aggressive response to criticism is a belief that 
anyone who attacks Scientology is a criminal of some sort. "We do not find 
critics of Scientology who do not have criminal pasts," Hubbard wrote back in 
1967. "Over and over we prove this." 
</P>
<P>
When Scientology takes the offensive, L. Ron Hubbard's writings provide the 
inspiration. Here is a sampling of what Hubbard wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the (lawsuit) is to harass and discourage rather than win." 
</P>
<P>
"If attacked on some vulnerable point by anyone or anything or any 
organization, always find or manufacture enough threat against them to cause 
them to sue for peace. . . . Don't ever defend. Always attack." 
</P>
<P>
"We do not want Scientology to be reported in the press, anywhere else than on 
the religious pages of newspapers. . . . Therefore, we should be very alert to 
sue for slander at the slightest chance so as to discourage the public presses 
from mentioning Scientology." 
</P>
<P>
"NEVER agree to an investigation of Scientology. Only agree to an investigation 
of the attackers. . . . Start feeding lurid, blood, sex crime, actual evidence 
on the attack to the press. Don't ever tamely submit to an investigation of us. 
Make it rough, rough on attackers all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Obedience to these rules is not discretionary. They are scripture and, as such, 
have guided a succession of church leaders in their responses to perceived 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Hubbard's doctrinal dictums have often served only to escalate 
conflicts and reinforce the cultish image the church has been trying to shake. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, British lawmaker Sir John Foster offered a seemingly 
timeless observation on Scientology in a report to his government. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote that "anyone whose attitude is such as Mr. Hubbard displays in his 
writings cannot be too surprised if the world treats him with suspicion rather 
than affection." 
</P>
<P>
Defeating its antagonists is considered so vital to the religion's survival 
that the church has a unit whose mandate is to bring "hostile philosophies or 
societies into a state of complete compliance with the goals of Scientology." 
</P>
<P>
Called the Office of Special Affairs, its duties include developing legal 
strategy and countering outside threats. 
</P>
<P>
Its predecessor was the Guardian Office, whose members became so overzealous 
that Hubbard's wife and 10 other Scientologists were jailed for bugging and 
burglarizing U.S. government agencies in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Scientology spokesmen say, attorneys are hired to handle conflicts with 
church adversaries to ensure that history does not repeat itself. The 
attorneys, they say, employ private detectives to help prepare court cases -- a 
role that, in the past, would have been filled by Scientologists from the 
Guardian Office. 
</P>
<P>
But some former Scientologists contend that the private detectives have simply 
replaced church members as agents of intimidation. The detectives are 
especially valued because they insulate the church from deceptive and 
potentially embarrassing investigative tactics that the church in fact 
endorses, according to this view. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first private detectives hired by the church was Richard Bast of 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, he investigated the sex life of U.S. District Judge James Richey, who 
was presiding over the criminal trial of Hubbard's wife and the 10 other 
Scientologists. Richey had issued rulings unfavorable to them. 
</P>
<P>
Bast's investigators found a prostitute at the Brentwood Holiday Inn who 
claimed that Richey had purchased her services while staying at the hotel 
during trips to Los Angeles. Bast's men gave her a lie detector test and 
videotaped her account. 
</P>
<P>
That and other information obtained by Bast's investigators was leaked to 
columnist Jack Anderson, and appeared in newspapers across the country. Soon 
after, Richey resigned from the case, citing health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Bast surfaced again, this time in Clearwater, Fla., where the church's 
secretive methods of operating had stirred community anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
Bast's detectives, posing as emissaries of a wealthy European industrialist, 
lured some of the community's most prominent businessmen aboard a luxurious 
yacht. Their pitch: the industrialist wanted to invest $100 million in 
Clearwater's decaying downtown. 
</P>
<P>
But there was a catch, recalled developer Alan Bomstein, one of the businessmen 
being wooed. The emissaries said their boss was dismayed by the conflict 
between Clearwater and Scientology, and wanted the businessmen to help quash a 
public inquiry into the church's activities. 
</P>
<P>
When the businessmen refused, Bomstein said, the emissaries vanished. Two years 
later, Bast revealed the deception in a court declaration. He said the 
undercover operation was necessary to learn whether Clearwater's elite were 
conspiring to run the church out of town. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Scientology investigations have been run by former Los Angeles 
Police Department sergeant Eugene Ingram, who was fired by the department in 
1981 for allegedly running a house of prostitution and alerting a drug dealer 
of a planned raid. (In a later jury trial, Ingram was acquitted of all criminal 
charges.) 
</P>
<P>
When he needs help, Ingram has sometimes turned to former LAPD colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Ex-officer Al Bei, for example, played a key role in a 1984 investigation of 
David Mayo, an influential Scientology defector who had opened a rival church 
near Santa Barbara. Scientologists believed Mayo was using stolen Hubbard 
teachings. 
</P>
<P>
Bei and other investigators questioned local businessmen, handing out business 
cards that said, "Special Agent, Task Force on White Collar Crime." 
</P>
<P>
Their questions suggested -- falsely -- that Mayo was linked to international 
terrorism and drug smuggling, according to court records. At a local bank, Bei 
tried without success to obtain Mayo's banking records and implied that Mayo 
was engaged in money laundering, an executive of the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
The investigators rented an office directly above Mayo's facility and leaned 
from the windows to photograph everyone who entered. 
</P>
<P>
Mayo eventually obtained a court order barring Ingram Investigations and church 
members from going near Mayo or his facility. The judge said the investigation 
amounted to "harassment." 
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, Bei surfaced on a quiet residential street in Burbank, 
where he questioned neighbors of two highly critical former Scientologists, 
Fred and Valerie Stansfield. The Stansfields had established a competing center 
in their home to provide Scientology courses. 
</P>
<P>
One of the neighbors said in a declaration that Bei attempted to "slander" the 
Stansfields with such questions as: "Did you know that Valerie told someone 
that she had pinworms two years ago?" 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police officer Philip Rodriguez is another who has assisted Ingram 
in Scientology investigations. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1984, he provided Ingram with a letter on plain stationery saying 
Ingram was authorized to covertly videotape a hostile former member suspected 
by church authorities of plotting illegal acts against the church. 
</P>
<P>
Although the letter was written without official police department approval, 
Rodriguez's action lent an air of legitimacy to the investigation. In fact, 
when church officials disclosed its results, they described the operation as 
"LAPD sanctioned" -- a characterization that Police Chief Daryl F. Gates 
angrily disputed. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was suspended for six months for his role in the affair. 
</P>
<P>
And when the clandestine videotapes were introduced in an Oregon court to 
discredit testimony by the former member, the presiding judge said: "I think 
they are devastating against the church. . . . It (the investigation) borders 
on entrapment more than it does on anything else." 
</P>
<P>
Another former LAPD officer, Charles Stapleton, worked part time for Ingram 
while teaching law at Los Angeles City College. 
</P>
<P>
"Gene is a very thorough investigator," Stapleton said in an interview. "He is 
determined to do the finest job he possibly can and he will employ whatever 
methods or tactics are necessary to do that job." 
</P>
<P>
Stapleton said he "bailed out" after Ingram asked him to tap telephones. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's going to know?" he quoted Ingram as saying. 
</P>
<P>
"I will know," Stapleton said he replied. 
</P>
<P>
"I was told that if I didn't want to do it, he knew somebody who would," 
Stapleton said, adding that he did not know whether any telephones had, in 
fact, been monitored. 
</P>
<P>
Ingram denied ever asking Stapleton to tap telephones. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never done it and I've never asked anyone to do it," Ingram said. "It's 
just not worth it. It's a crime. You're going to get caught, so why do it?" 
</P>
<P>
Ingram also said that he has not harassed anyone during his probes. He 
describes himself simply as "aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
"People who claim that I have conducted an improper investigation against them 
probably have so many things to hide," said Ingram. 
</P>
<P>
Church lawyer Cooley backed the investigator, saying: "I know of no impropriety 
that has ever been engaged in by Mr. Ingram or any other (private investigator) 
for the church. Mr. Ingram has done nothing wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ingram and his colleagues surfaced in the small town of Newkirk, 
Okla., to investigate city officials and the local newspaper publisher. The 
publisher has been crusading against a controversial Scientology-backed drug 
treatment program called Narconon. 
</P>
<P>
At the core of the dispute is a contention by publisher Bob Lobsinger that 
Narconon concealed its Scientology connection when it leased an abandoned 
school outside town to build the "world's largest" drug rehabilitation center. 
</P>
<P>
Lobsinger's weekly newspaper has written about Scientology's troubled past, and 
published internal documents on the drug program. In the process, he has helped 
rally community opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting back, Scientology attorneys in September mailed an "open letter" to 
many of Newkirk's 2,500 residents announcing that Ingram had been hired to 
investigate Narconon's adversaries. The letter said that "a few local 
individuals have sought to create intolerance by broadsiding the Churches of 
Scientology in stridently uncomplimentary terms." 
</P>
<P>
After arriving in town, Ingram tracked down the mayor's 12-year-old son at the 
local public library, handed him a business card and told the boy to have his 
father call, Lobsinger said. "It was just a subtle bit of intimidation," he 
said. "It certainly did not do the mother much good. She was very unnerved." 
</P>
<P>
Lobsinger said investigators also camped out at the local courthouse, where 
they searched public records for "dirt" on prominent local citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"They were checking up on the banker, the president of the school board, the 
president of the Chamber of Commerce and, of course, the mayor and his family, 
and me," Lobsinger said. 
</P>
<P>
Newkirk Mayor Garry Bilger, who opposed the drug treatment program, said a man 
he believes was a church member tried to coax him into disclosing personal 
information. Bilger said the man showed up without an appointment and claimed 
that he was helping his daughter with a report on small-town government for a 
class at a nearby high school. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted to interview me and take pictures around the office but I didn't 
allow that," the mayor recalled. "Finally, I said, 'Are you with Scientology or 
Narconon?' He said, 'I don't know about those people.' But he did, because he 
got outta there in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
Before the man left, he gave Bilger the name of his daughter. The mayor then 
checked with the school system and was told that no such girl was enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a standard pattern," Bilger said of the Scientologists. "They try to 
be very aggressive. They try to intimidate. This is not the kind of atmosphere 
we need in the Newkirk community. . . . This tells me they are far from being 
harmless." 
</P>
<P>
Scientology critics contend that one church writing, above all others, has 
guided the organization and its operatives when they fight back. It is called 
the Fair Game Law. 
</P>
<P>
Written by Hubbard in the mid-1960s, it states that anyone who impedes 
Scientology is "fair game" and can "be deprived of property or injured by any 
means by any Scientologist without any discipline of the Scientologist. May be 
tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
Church spokesmen maintain that Hubbard rescinded the policy three years after 
it was written because its meaning had been twisted. What Hubbard actually 
meant, according to the spokesmen, was that Scientology will not protect 
ex-members from people in the outside world who try to trick, sue or destroy 
them. 
</P>
<P>
But various judges and juries have concluded that while the actual labeling of 
persons as "fair game" was abandoned, the harassment continued unabated. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a Los Angeles jury in 1986 said that Scientologists had employed 
fair game tactics against disaffected member Larry Wollersheim, driving him to 
the brink of financial and mental collapse. He was awarded $30 million. In 
July, the state Court of Appeal reduced the amount to $2.5 million but refused 
to overturn the case. 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Justice Earl Johnson Jr.: "Scientology leaders made the deliberate 
decision to ruin Wollersheim economically and possibly psychologically. . . . 
Such conduct is too outrageous to be protected under the Constitution and too 
unworthy to be privileged under the law of torts." 
</P>
<P>
In a recent lawsuit, former Scientology attorney Joseph Yanny alleged that the 
church and its agents had implemented or plotted a broad array of fair-game 
measures against him and other critics, including intensive surveillance and 
dirty tricks. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury awarded Yanny $154,000 in 
legal fees that he said the church had refused to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Yanny said in his lawsuit that he attended a 1987 meeting 
at which top church officials and three private detectives discussed 
blackmailing Los Angeles attorney Charles O'Reilly, who won the 
multimillion-dollar jury award for Wollersheim. 
</P>
<P>
According to Yanny, the plan was to steal O'Reilly's medical records from the 
Betty Ford Clinic near Palm Springs, then exchange them for a promise from 
O'Reilly that he would "ease off" during the appeal process. 
</P>
<P>
Yanny, who later had a bitter break with Scientology, said he objected and the 
idea was dropped. The church denies such a discussion ever took place. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not a scintilla of independent evidence that Yanny's counsel was ever 
sought for any illegal or fraudulent purpose," church attorneys argued in court 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous other church detractors have said in court documents and interviews 
that they, too, were victims of fair game tactics even after the policy 
supposedly was abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
John G. Clark, an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical 
School, said he once criticized the church during testimony before the Vermont 
legislature. Scientology "agents" retaliated, Clark alleged in a 1985 lawsuit, 
by trying to destroy his reputation and career. 
</P>
<P>
He said in the lawsuit that they filed groundless complaints against him with 
government agencies, posed as clients to infiltrate his office, dug through his 
trash, implied that he slept with female patients and offered a $25,000 reward 
for information that would put him in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"My sin," Clark said in an interview, "was publicly saying this is a dangerous 
and harmful cult. They did a good job of showing I'm right." 
</P>
<P>
Scientologists, for their part, have described Clark as a "professional 
deprogrammer," who in court cases has diagnosed members of religious sects as 
mentally ill without conducting direct examinations of them. They have branded 
his professional work as fraudulent and his psychiatric theories as "childish 
and nonsensical." 
</P>
<P>
In the words of one Scientology spokesman: "It's a crime that he's walking on 
the street right now." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the church paid Clark an undisclosed sum to drop his lawsuit. In 
exchange for the money, Clark agreed never again to publicly criticize 
Scientology. 
</P>
<P>
On the opposite coast, psychiatrist Louis (Jolly) West, who formerly directed 
UCLA's Neuropsychiatric Institute, said he also has felt the wrath of 
Scientology. 
</P>
<P>
West, an expert on thought control techniques, said his problems began in 1980 
after he published a psychiatric textbook that called Scientology a cult. 
</P>
<P>
West said Scientology attempted to get him fired by writing letters to 
university officials suggesting that he is a CIA-backed fascist who has 
advocated genocide and castration of minorities to curb crime. 
</P>
<P>
He said Scientologists once managed to get inside a downtown Los Angeles 
banquet room before guests arrived for a dinner celebrating the 
Neuropsychiatric Institute's 25th anniversary. On each plate, West said, was 
placed "an obscenely vicious diatribe" against him and the institute -- neatly 
tied with a pink ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
So consumed are some Scientologists by their zeal to punish foes that they have 
violated the confidentiality of one of the religion's most sacred practices, 
according to a number of former members. 
</P>
<P>
These former members accuse others in the church of culling confessional 
folders for information that can be used to embarrass, discredit or blackmail 
hostile defectors -- a practice once called "repugnant and outrageous" by a Los 
Angeles Superior Court judge. Some of these former members say they themselves 
took part in the practice. 
</P>
<P>
The confidential folders contain the parishioners' most intimate secrets, 
disclosed during one-on-one counseling sessions that are supposed to help 
devotees unburden their spirits. The church retains the folders even after a 
member leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, former church attorney Yanny said in a sworn declaration that he was 
fed information from confessional folders to help him question former members 
during pretrial proceedings. Yanny said he complained but was informed by two 
Scientology executives that it was "standard practice." 
</P>
<P>
Church executives have steadfastly denied that the confidentiality of the 
folders has been breached. They maintain that "auditors" -- Scientologists who 
counsel other members -- must abide by a code of conduct in which they promise 
never to divulge secrets revealed to them "for punishment or personal gain." 
</P>
<P>
"And that trust," the code states, "is sacred and never to be betrayed." 
</P>
<P>
Often, those who buck the church say their lives are suddenly troubled by 
unexplained and untraceable events, ranging from hang-up telephone calls to the 
mysterious deaths of pets. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles attorney Leta Schlosser, for one, said someone developed "an 
unusual interest" in her car trunk while she was part of the legal team in the 
Wollersheim suit against Scientology. She said it was broken into at least 
seven times. 
</P>
<P>
She said her co-counsel, O'Reilly, discovered a tape recorder, wired to his 
telephone line, hidden beneath some bushes outside his home. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the British author, Russell Miller. After his biography of 
Hubbard was published, an anonymous caller to police implicated him in the 
unsolved ax-slaying of a South London private eye. 
</P>
<P>
Miller was interrogated by two detectives, who concluded that he was innocent. 
Det. Sgt. Malcolm Davidson of Scotland Yard told the Los Angeles Times that the 
caller "caused us to waste a lot of time investigating" and "caused Mr. Miller 
some embarrassment." 
</P>
<P>
There is no evidence that ties the church to any of these incidents, and 
Scientology officials deny involvement in clandestine harassment or illegal 
activities. They suggest that church foes may themselves be responsible as part 
of an effort to discredit Scientology. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Scientology movement is engaged in a sweeping effort to gain 
influence across a broad swath of society, from schools to businesses, in hopes 
of winning converts and creating a hospitable environment for church expansion. 
</P>
<P>
And Hubbard's followers apparently consider his theology of combat an important 
component. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, they elevated to high doctrine a warning he wrote two decades ago in a 
Scientology newspaper, addressed to "people who seek to stop us." 
</P>
<P>
"If you oppose Scientology we promptly look up -- and will find and expose -- 
your crimes," he wrote. "If you leave us alone we will leave you alone. It's 
very simple. Even a fool can grasp that. 
</P>
<P>
"And don't underrate our ability to carry it out. . . . Those who try to make 
life difficult for us are at once at risk."

SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A devastating wildfire continued to burn out of control here Thursday night 
after destroying 350 homes, injuring a helicopter crewman and blackening 3,500 
acres during a brutal, windswept march from the mountains to the coast. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Barbara fire was one of four major blazes that claimed at least 420 
homes across Southern California during a heat wave that finally began to ease 
up on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the fires -- the one in Santa Barbara plus others in Glendale and the 
Chino Hills -- were believed started by arsonists. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian, who toured fire ravaged areas Thursday, offered $50,000 
rewards for anyone responsible for the Santa Barbara and Glendale fires and 
declared both communities disaster areas, paving the way for state aid to 
rebuild the stricken neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth fire, in rugged brushlands south of Corona, was the product of a 
controlled burn that burst out of control late Wednesday on gusty winds. 
</P>
<P>
A fifth, smaller fire erupted in Claremont on Thursday afternoon, threatening 
10 homes evacuated near Marshall Canyon Golf Course, Los Angeles County fire 
officials said. About 300 fire fighters were battling the blaze, assisted by 
water-dropping helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
Residential damage in the Santa Barbara blaze was estimated at more than $190 
million. No estimates were available for commerical structures, like the 
several retail businesses that burned in the blaze, or for government 
buildings, like the Santa Barbara County jail facility that suffered heavy 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Forest Service helicopter crashed during a water drop at about 2:50 p.m. 
Thursday afternoon as fire fighters battled to contain the rear flank of the 
Santa Barbara blaze near the summit of San Marcos Pass, about 15 miles east of 
former President Reagan's Rancho Cielo. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the pilot -- the only one aboard the craft -- suffered cuts. The 
cause of the crash was not immediately determined. 
</P>
<P>
There was no prediction when the blaze might be contained. For much of the 
afternoon, the flames threatened to push north, through a health spa owned by 
actress Jane Fonda and over the crest of the pass into the Santa Ynez Valley. 
Then, late in the afternoon, offshore breezes returned, and portions of the 
fire turned back south towrd the main burn area. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which officials say was set by an arsonist at about 6 p.m. Wednesday 
about a mile below the pass, had first moved in a generally southerly 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing on bristling "Sundowner" winds, the blaze swept downhill through 
homes in the San Antonio Creek and Cathedral Oaks areas before leaping Highway 
101, scorching a trestle on the Southern Pacific mainline and invading posh 
residential communities along the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just total devastation," Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department 
spokesman Tim Grassey said shortly before dawn Thursday as the flames continued 
to advance. "You never felt more helpless. You look at it and there's nothing 
you can do to stop it." 
</P>
<P>
Several of the houses that burned were multi-million-dollar structures in the 
exclusive Hope Ranch enclave, where residents attempting to stem the blaze with 
garden hoses were forced to flee for their lives as water pressure in the 
severely drought plagued areadwindled to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
In nearby Rancho San Antonio Estates, 60-year-old Gerry Hon, a retired truck 
driver, decided to make a stand. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I could save it," the grizzled Korean War veteran explained, 
pointing to the home he shares with his mother. "They wanted me to leave, but I 
refused to." 
</P>
<P>
His pants singed, his t-shirt blackened and a bandage covering a bicep 
blistered by flames, Hon said that he decided to battle for his home, "because 
there's a lifetime of momentos in there . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I grabbed my garden hose and climbed on the roof," he said. "Pretty soon, I 
was completely surrounded by fire. My t-shirt caught fire, and I had to turn 
the hose on myself to to put it out. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It got so bad that I finally climbed down and ran to my car," he said. "Then I 
just stopped and said, 'Bullshit to this."' 
</P>
<P>
Hon said he climbed back on the roof, turned the hose back on and resumed his 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
Hours later, the flames had moved on for good, the house was intact, and, back 
on the ground once more, Hon felt "so weak and tired and wet that I was numb" 
</P>
<P>
But he wasn't finished, yet. 
</P>
<P>
He grabbed an American flag he keeps in the back yard, clambered back up on the 
roof and mounted the fluttering pennant on the peak of the gable. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt the need to see something flying," he explained, quietly. 
</P>
<P>
Fire fighters said several elements were conspiring against them -- gusting 
winds, high temperatures, low humidity, thick underbrush that hadn't burned 
since 1955 and the prolonged drought that has parched the brush and drained the 
reservoirs of a community already forced to ration water to the point that 
lawns and shrubbery were bone dry. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the other blazes in the Southland that limited the available 
fire-fighting resources, officials were able to deploy a ground force of 700 
fire fighters against the Santa Barbara fire by dawn Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
With the return of daylight, aerial tankers began swooping overhead, dropping 
water on hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
Fire fighters eventually gained control of the southern flank of the fire, 
where most of the homes had burned, and the battle veered to the north, near 
San Marcos Pass. 
</P>
<P>
As the action turned away from their neighborhoods, hundreds of those who fled 
in the night -- many of them to an evacuation center of the UC Santa Barbara 
gymnasium, returned to survey the damage. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie Dickinson sat quietly on a blackened rock, staring at the charred 
remains of the home she and her husband had shared for 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
"But we can count our blessings," she managed through her tears. "You know, a 
house. We can rebuild it. It's not the end of the world . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Ilya Magid, who lost his home, said he and his wife immigrated from Lithuania 
in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
"Ten years ago, we start from nothing," he said. "Now, again, we start from 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that because of the damage to the railroad bridge, Amtrak 
passengers will be bused between Los Angeles and San Luis Obispo until repairs 
are completed, probably within several days. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic was still interrupted Thursday night on a number of highways in the 
Santa Barbara area. 
</P>
<P>
In Glendale, fire fighters mopped up Thursday after a fast-moving blaze that 
destroyed at least 46 homes and damaged 20 more before flames were brought 
under control at about 8 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Damage was estimated at $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
Evening rush-hour traffic was brought to a halt at the height of the fire 
Wednesday as flames burned on both sides of the Glendale Freeway. Driven by 
winds gusting at up to 35 m.p.h., the flames leapfrogged from house to house, 
destroying some, leaving others untouched. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, Kim Hong leafed through a leatherbound Bible stacked amid 
the few belongings recovered from her charred home on Avonoaks Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything else in my bedroom was destroyed," she said. "There was fire on top 
and fire on the bottom of this, and it didn't burn. God must have protected the 
words." 
</P>
<P>
Arson investigators said a butane lighter, locked in the open position with a 
pen, apparently was used to start the fire. It was the third time this week 
that a butane lighter had been used in this fashion to start a brush fire in 
the area, and officials said they believe the same person is responsible.. 
</P>
<P>
At the San Bernardino County-Orange County line in the Chino Hills, 12 homes 
were destroyed in a blaze that spread rapidly over 6,250 acres of rolling 
chapparal near the Carbon Canyon community of Sleepy Hollow. 
</P>
<P>
Eight fire fighters suffered minor injuries battling the fire, which was full 
contained by nightfall Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Reyes, a 29-year-old transient, was arrested on suspicion of setting the 
blaze. 
</P>
<P>
In Riverside County, another 12 homes were destroyed in a fire that raced 
through 2,200 acres of rugged brushland south of Corona, near Interstate 15. 
</P>
<P>
About 400 fire fighters were battling the blaze, which stemmed from a 
controlled burn that got away from U. S. Forest Service crews. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Bolan, a forest service spokeswoman, said the fire was deliberately set in 
the Cleveland National Forest about a week ago to clear away unwanted 
vegetation and create a "fuel barrier" to block the spread of future wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
She said that although the temperatures were low, humidity was high and winds 
were gentle when the fire was set, all that changed earlier this week as the 
dry, windy heat wave descended on the area. 
</P>
<P>
Bolan said embers buried deep beneath the soil -- undetected with infrared 
sensors on USFS surveillance planes -- were apparently fanned to life by the 
winds, rekindling the blaze that spread rapidly into heavy chapparal. 
</P>
<P>
In Riverside County, 17 firefighters were burned Wednesday -- one critically -- 
as they battled a blaze that seared about 125 acres an undeveloped parcel of 
land southwest of Hemet. The blaze was fully controlled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County fire fighters in the mountainous Julian area were battling a 
blaze Thursday night near the Santa Ysabel Indian Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported at 2:20 p.m. and no cause was known, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
By 6 p.m., 300 people in the largely rural area had been evacuated, most of 
them from two camps, one for Boy Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
Three other San Diego fires that erupted Wednesday had been contained. 
</P>
<P>
A 28-year-old Castaic man was arrested Thursday on suspicion of setting at 
least three fires in the Antelope Valley that blackened several acres, but did 
not damage any homes, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
David Wayne Cunningham, 28, was arrested by Los Angeles County Sheriff's arson 
investigators at the home of his girl friend in Quartz Hill, about 1 1/2 miles 
from the third of three fires set shortly after midnight Thursday, said 
sheriff's Sgt. Ron Shreves. 
</P>
<P>
Shreves said Cunningham was originally an informant on the fires, having 
reported them to U.S. Forest Service officials. 
</P>
<P>
"When deputies interviewed him at 4 a.m., they found several inconsistencies in 
his statements," Shreves said, "and physical evidence indicating he probably 
set the fires." 
</P>
<P>
Arson investigators in the area were called out on at least three additional 
fires later in the day Thursday, apparently unrelated to those attributed to 
Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
"It is common for us to get copy cat fires," Shreves said. 
</P>
<P>
In Arizona, a fire continued to burn out of control Thursday after scorching 
16,500 acres and destroying 50 homes in the Tonto National Forest area 90 miles 
north of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials said five prison inmates and a prison employee were killed 
while battling the blaze. The officials said the victims were among several 
crews trapped when a "dry thunderstorm" struck the area, starting dozens of 
blazes that spread simultaneously in all directions. 
</P>
<P>
The fire destroyed a cabin built in the 1920s by novelist Zane Grey, who set 
many of his stories in the pine-shaded Tonto rim area.

JAPANESE PLAN GLOBAL ENTERTAINMENT VENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seeking an expanded role in the global entertainment market, a consortium of 
Japanese corporations is poised to announce the formation of an international 
media company that will invest in everything from Hollywood movie production to 
sports programming. 
</P>
<P>
Media International Corp. will provide as much as $700 million in funding for 
an array of entertainment ventures by its fifth year of operation, company 
President Takao Yoshiki said. The Tokyo-based company will start with $200 
million in capital. 
</P>
<P>
"We realize this is a multimedia society," Yoshiki said. "This company's 
purpose is to make partners with European and American media giants as well as 
major production houses." 
</P>
<P>
Media International is primarily the creation of a Japanese Broadcasting Corp. 
subsidiary known as NHK Enterprises, which has pledged $30 million in capital 
to the deal. Other initial backers, Yoshiki said, are Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, the 
world's largest commercial bank; Sumitomo Bank, another top worldwide financial 
institution, and Seibu Saison, a conglomerate that operates airlines, 
department stores, supermarkets and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshiki said 10 corporations will eventually form the core support group of the 
company, and Media International will have access to as much as $1 billion 
through its backers. NHK has told its potential partners that the company 
should become profitable within five years. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street analysts said Media International could become a significant force 
in the entertainment industry. David Londoner of Wertheim Schroder, a New York 
investment firm, said Hollywood -- especially the independent production 
companies -- will welcome the presence of a new investment partner. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Londoner said, the Japanese stand to benefit from holding the 
copyrights to film, television and cable projects they may undertake.

Traditionally involved most prominently in the equipment end of the business, 
Japanese companies have been moving more aggressively into programming lately. 
Japanese firms recently have invested in Carolco Pictures and Largo 
Entertainment, and Sony Corp. last year bought Columbia Pictures Entertainment 
outright for $3.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"When Wertheim Schroder did an entertainment conference in Japan last March, 
the message came through loud and clear that there was great interest in Japan 
in aligning with American film and television producers as a way of securing 
Japanese rights," Londoner said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first places Media International's representatives are likely to 
land is Hollywood. Independent producer Thomas Mount, who is familiar with the 
Japanese media, said the company will ultimately be "besieged" by executives 
seeking funding. 
</P>
<P>
"It is going to have a very positive impact for the flow of motion pictures," 
Mount said. "They have some very ambitious plans and the cash to achieve them." 
</P>
<P>
However, one well-placed entertainment executive warned that certain Japanese 
investors have flirted with the concept of Hollywood venture partnerships 
before, only to withdraw when Hollywood sought a serious commitment. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is whether they will spend the money," said the executive, who 
asked not to be named. "There's no way to know. People will come to them with 
stupid deals, and the Japanese are very shrewd about knowing the value of a 
dollar." 
</P>
<P>
Autonomy has been another key concern when the Japanese have invested in 
American entertainment companies or products. Analysts said that Media 
International will encounter strong resistance if it seeks creative control 
over projects with American companies. 
</P>
<P>
NHK Enterprises, the Japanese corporation behind the venture, already has 
experience in the news and sports programming fields. One consultant who has 
worked with the company said that NHK and its partners want to capitalize on 
the new opportunities presented by the 1992 opening of the European Community, 
economic reform in Eastern Europe and new technologies such as satellite 
broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
"They're finding that they need to have more international lines out," said 
consultant Ralph Thomson of International Business Catalysts. "It's shared 
risks and shared profits." 
</P>
<P>
Media International's business plans should become clearer in the months ahead. 
But initial plans call for the company to act as a partner in international 
broadcasting productions, major motion pictures, sporting events and news 
programming, in addition to marketing the rights to its products in Japan and 
abroad. Yoshiki said the firm might also raise funds above and beyond its 
annual budget for projects of special merit. 
</P>
<P>
Media International plans to incorporate formally next Thursday and hopes to 
open its doors for business by November. Yoshiki said the firm will have a 
staff of at least 50 based in Tokyo. It may also hire staff members and 
consultants in the United States and elsewhere, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those consultants may be needed to help the company evaluate projects and wade 
through the choppy waters of entertainment co-ventures. "We're thinking of 
getting help from both the United States and Europe," Yoshiki said. "We believe 
Japan will play a larger role in the global entertainment market . . . but we 
would also like to learn a lot from you."

SILBERMAN FOUND GUILTY OF ONE COUNT; JURY REMAINS DEADLOCKED ON FIVE OTHERS

<P>
Richard T. Silberman, a former top aide to Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., was 
convicted Thursday of violating a federal currency law in an alleged scheme to 
launder drug profits. The San Diego financier was sent immediately to jail. 
</P>
<P>
The jury that convicted Silberman of the single count, however, deadlocked on 
five other charges. U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving ordered the panel 
back to court today for further deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman faces up to 10 years in federal prison on the single count, a 
technical charge of structuring a transaction to avoid the paper work federal 
law requires for any cash transaction over $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
The other counts in the case revolve around the central charges alleging that 
Silberman, 61, laundered $300,000 purportedly characterized by an undercover 
FBI agent as the proceeds of Colombian cocaine trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Irving said that the law required him to incarcerate Silberman unless the 
businessman could show clearly that he was not a flight risk. In light of 
Silberman's disappearance and purported suicide attempt in Las Vegas in 
February, Irving said there was no choice but to order him to the federal 
Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, 61, gasped as Irving announced the jailing. He bit his lip when the 
jury returned its guilty verdict but otherwise showed no emotion. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, San Diego County Supervisor Susan Golding, watched from the front row 
of seats and displayed no emotion at the verdict or the jailing. Golding 
declined to comment on the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers in the case, Assistant U.S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr. and defense 
attorney James J. Brosnahan, also declined to comment on the verdict, saying 
that a gag order imposed months ago was still effective because the case was 
not yet over. 
</P>
<P>
Brosnahan said that he would contest the jailing at a hearing on the issue that 
Irving set for today. The lawyer added, "I am sure everyone can understand what 
this is like." 
</P>
<P>
Silberman has been indicted on seven felony counts in the case; the jury has 
been given six to decide. The seventh, which is Irving's to consider, is a 
criminal forfeiture charge through which prosecutors are seeking the return of 
the stocks, bonds and cash in the case. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining charges include two counts of money laundering, a single one of 
conspiring to launder money and two more alleging federal currency violations. 
The trial began May 1. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on all six counts, Silberman could draw as much as 75 years in 
prison. Irving did not immediately set a formal sentencing date.

RIGHTS PANEL BACKS JOBS BILL, WARNS OF QUOTAS

The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, in a sharp break with its conservative 
recent past, Thursday announced its endorsement of pending civil rights 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"More, not less, needs to be done to provide redress to victims of employment 
discrimination and to reduce the amount of discrimination in employment," it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the panel said it had some concerns -- shared by the Bush 
Administration -- that one section of the bill could lead to encouraging the 
use of "illegal quotas" by employers. 
</P>
<P>
The commission urged Congress to adopt language to make clear that in the 
absence of a finding or order by the courts, the controversial section of the 
bill is "not intended to promote employment quotas, nor will the use of quotas 
be condoned as a means of avoiding liability under this section." 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a section of the bill overturning a Supreme Court decision that 
said employers no longer had to show a "business necessity" for their hiring 
practices that resulted in a "disparate impact" on women and minorities.

JURY SEES BARRY'S ALLEGED DRUG USE; 
</P>
<P>
TRIAL: A VIDEOTAPE SHOWS THE MAYOR USING A PIPE THE PROSECUTION SAYS WAS LOADED 
WITH CRACK COCAINE. 'I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING,' HE DECLARES ON THE TAPE.

<P>
Jurors in Marion Barry's drug and perjury trial Thursday saw a videotaped image 
of the Washington mayor pick up a pipe allegedly loaded with crack cocaine, 
light it with a cigarette lighter and take a "hit" by inhaling the smoke, then 
do it a second time. 
</P>
<P>
Within two minutes, the screen was filled with plainclothes police and FBI 
agents bursting in to arrest Barry on drug charges, as he declared: "I don't 
have any. . . . I didn't have anything." 
</P>
<P>
Then, realizing that he had been lured into a federal sting operation by a 
former mistress, Barry began to repeat, over and over: "Goddamn setup. . . . 
I'll be goddamn . . . bitch set me up," as agents read him the arrest charges 
and checked his heartbeat and blood pressure for any reaction to the drug. 
</P>
<P>
The tape of the arrest last Jan. 18 strongly suggests that Barry knew what he 
was doing and how to do it at the moment when he lit the pipe. But the tape 
also shows Rasheeda Moore, the ex-model who lured him to the spot, repeatedly 
urging Barry to try the substance, which he is seen paying for on the tape. 
</P>
<P>
For much of their conversation, which reflects the intimacy of a close 
relationship, it appears that Barry was more interested in sleeping with Moore 
than in smoking any cocaine. There is no sexual act on the tape, however. 
</P>
<P>
R. Kenneth Mundy, Barry's lead defense lawyer, has denounced the arrest as 
"entrapment pure and simple" and egregious misconduct by a government that he 
says had tried to "get" Barry for years. Late Thursday, Mundy opened a 
counterattack by attempting to brand Moore's cooperation with the FBI as the 
act of a desperate woman, jobless and spending welfare checks on cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Mundy also made a move Thursday to advance the political side of this racially 
charged case by attempting to bring Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan into 
the courtroom as a "guest of the defense." But on orders of federal Judge 
Thomas Penfield Jackson, U.S. marshals barred Farrakhan from the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Mundy, whose objections to prosecution tactics have been regularly overruled by 
Jackson, rose to protest in open court, drawing a sharp rejoinder from the 
judge. The presence of Farrakhan in the courtroom would be "disruptive, if not 
intimidating," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
"He is persona non grata in this courtroom. He will be barred henceforth for 
the balance of the trial," the judge declared. 
</P>
<P>
Mundy hinted at an appeal to a higher court and asked the judge to give a 
reason for his action, but Jackson snapped: "My reason is on the record. You 
can take it to the court of appeals if you wish." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Assistant U.S. Atty. Judith E. Retchin carefully led Moore 
through a narrative account of the alleged crack-smoking incident at the Vista 
International Hotel, where Barry was arrested, in an attempt to preempt Mundy's 
claim of entrapment by putting a prosecution spin on that evidence. 
</P>
<P>
She drew from Moore that Barry first brought up the subject of drugs early in 
the videotaped encounter by asking Moore "have you been good?" -- which Moore 
said was part of their private, drug users' language. "It was understood 
dialogue between the two of us," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
In dramatic testimony Wednesday, Moore had told the jury that she and Barry had 
used cocaine and other drugs "over 100 times" over nearly three years, starting 
in June, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Moore also denied that she put any "pressure" on Barry to take the pipe, and 
she insisted that he had known for years how to light up most kinds of crack 
pipes, including the tube-like "stem" or "straight shooter" that was used that 
night. And she specifically denied ever using the term "chicken" to egg Barry 
on to drug use. In recent weeks, Barry supporters have passed the word that 
Moore pushed Barry into transgression by telling him it would be "chicken" not 
to do so. The word "chicken" does not occur on the hourlong videotape. 
</P>
<P>
Retchin, anticipating Mundy's cross-examination, also led Moore through the 
most self-flattering possible account of her decision to cooperate with the FBI 
in a sting aimed at Barry. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that she was promised no lenient treatment by authorities, but 
rather was led by a desire to "get rid of a lot of things" in her life, in a 
"personal cleansing" that she said derived from a turn to religion during a 
lean period in her personal fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the right thing to do," she said, as well as a way to help turn Barry 
away from the path she believed he was on. 
</P>
<P>
"If a leader is corrupt, it will affect the people, just as my drug abuse 
affected my family," she said. "If there is a leader in a city who does not 
lead properly, that will trickle down to the people. The mayor and I had talked 
about the effect (of) drug abuse. . . . He (once) said to me he realized it 
affected his position as a leader." 
</P>
<P>
On the tape, Barry is seen and heard paying for crack supplied by "Wanda," an 
undercover FBI agent working the sting with Moore, but he also is shown 
reluctant to use it. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, in an audiotape also played for the jury Thursday of a phone 
conversation earlier that evening in which Moore invites Barry to the Vista, it 
is as though Barry suspected something was up but then went ahead and took the 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
"There are too many nosey roses around these days," he said on the phone, at 
first refusing to go to Moore's hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
In the room, with the crack paid for and delivered, Barry at first says: "I 
don't smoke no more, honey," and then he is seen and heard to play coy for many 
minutes, while Wanda pretends to go out to get some powder cocaine for him to 
inhale. But no sooner is Wanda out of the room than Barry asks: "You got a 
pipe?" When one is produced, he asks: "How does this work? I don't know how 
this work. I never done this before." 
</P>
<P>
Appearing incredulous, Moore explains where the crack goes and where to apply 
the flame. "Let me give you a lighter," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"You do it," Barry says, over and over. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought you bought this 'cause you wanted to take a hit," she says. Moore 
protests that smoking crack makes her "hyper." 
</P>
<P>
But while they talk back and forth, the tape shows Barry standing up from the 
bed on which he had been sitting, walking over to the table where the pipe had 
been left, picking it up, lighting it and smoking it twice -- even while Moore 
keeps talking about geting "hyper." 
</P>
<P>
"You all right?" she asks. "You don't want to take another one?" 
</P>
<P>
Barry replies: "No, you're crazy." 
</P>
<P>
He puts on his jacket in a move to leave and is heard trying to call his 
security detail on his walkie-talkie when FBI agents enter the room and arrest 
him.

<P>
Horacio Santos, a 42-year-old nuclear engineer, had already been robbed 13 or 
14 times, his family and friends say. When it happened yet again, he cracked -- 
and a national uproar ensued. 
</P>
<P>
At about 11 a.m. on June 16, Santos heard his car alarm go off while he was 
shopping near his home. He ran into the street to find two men stealing his car 
stereo. As they fled in an old Chevrolet, Santos leaped into his Renault Fuego 
and gave chase. 
</P>
<P>
A few blocks away, he overtook and halted the thieves. In a rage, he fired two 
shots, one into each man's head, killing them instantly. 
</P>
<P>
In the days since the killings in the southern Buenos Aires suburb of Via del 
Parque, Argentines have been convulsed in arguments over their deteriorating 
justice system and whether an otherwise good citizen was justified in shooting 
two men dead for stealing his tape deck. 
</P>
<P>
People talk of worsening crime, of inefficient and corrupt police -- and some 
say, "Santos, well done." Others cite the nation's struggle to restore 
democracy after a brutal seven-year military dictatorship and worry that such 
vigilante justice threatens their hard-won rule of law. 
</P>
<P>
Many cite the parallels to the case of Bernard Goetz, who shot at youths who 
surrounded him on a New York subway train in December, 1984. Goetz was later 
sentenced to one year in prison and a $5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
But others point to differences in the two cases: Goetz appeared to be 
physically threatened; Santos pursued the thieves, who were apparently unarmed, 
caught them and shot them. The Goetz case had racial overtones, involving a 
white man and black youths. The Santos case is more a matter of class in 
racially homogeneous Argentina. He is solidly middle class; the slain thieves 
were poor, said to be suffering from the ravages of hyperinflation and 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
Santos is in custody undergoing psychiatric testing. His lawyers say they will 
contend that he went insane momentarily from the combined effect of numerous 
previous robberies. 
</P>
<P>
His car stereo had been stolen repeatedly -- an epidemic in Argentina -- and 
his wife and neighbors have been quoted as saying he had suffered 13 or 14 
robberies in all. He had become a security fanatic, organizing a community 
watch and a private police post, increasingly common in Buenos Aires suburbs, 
and he was licensed to carry the .32-caliber revolver he used to kill the 
robbers. 
</P>
<P>
The two victims, Osvaldo Aguirre, 29, and Carlos Gonzalez, 31, both were 
married with children and reportedly had criminal records on charges including 
robbery and drug possession. Their families' lawyers are demanding at least 
eight years in prison for Santos. 
</P>
<P>
Official figures show common crime has risen steadily in Argentina in recent 
years as the economy has worsened, although there is general agreement that 
Buenos Aires, a city of more than 10 million, remains far safer than most 
American cities. Nationwide, 659,869 crimes were reported in 1989, up 173,000 
from 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Bernardo Neustadt, Argentina's most prominent talk-show host and commentator, 
wrote of the Santos case: "In the two certain bullets there is a notice to the 
thieves: The citizens are beginning to defend themselves. Take fright, you 
violators of the law. . . . I would have done the same, God forgive me." 
</P>
<P>
Neustadt's comments drew warnings from officials and rival commentators that, 
however imperfect, the justice system remains the only alternative to the law 
of the jungle.

NO MAJOR IMPACT FROM BUSH'S LATIN PLAN LIKELY SOON; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMICS: ONLY MEXICO AND BRAZIL ARE ANYWHERE NEAR BEING READY TO UNDERTAKE 
THE REFORMS IT DEMANDS.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush's Latin America initiative is potentially the most sweeping 
since the Alliance for Progress of the early 1960s, but it may well be years 
before it has any major impact, government and private analysts said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mexico and possibly Brazil may move quickly to take advantage of the 
trade and debt-reduction benefits that the proposal offers, most other Latin 
countries are nowhere near being prepared to undertake the kind of economic 
reforms that it demands in return. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, which offers to negotiate U.S.-Latin American free-trade agreements, 
forgive the debts that Latin countries owe the U.S. government and set up a new 
regional lending pool to finance change from national industries to private 
enterprise, was hailed here and in Latin America on Thursday as a long-needed 
step. 
</P>
<P>
"This marks the first time in a decade or more that a U.S. Administration has 
said to Latin Americans, 'Let's sit down and talk about problems that you 
consider important,' " said Peter Hakim, staff director of the Inter-American 
Dialogue, a Washington research group. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro-Pablo Kuczynski, a former Peruvian Cabinet minister and now chairman of 
First Boston International, agreed: "When you add up the numbers, it doesn't 
come to all that much -- but it's the right time, and the right gesture." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the proposal outlined by Bush on Wednesday has some 
substantial political and economic pluses. 
</P>
<P>
It provides a badly needed political framework, in the form of a proposed 
economic "partnership" with the United States, to enable Latin leaders to 
embrace the plan openly without fear that they will be accused of "selling out" 
to the Yanquis. 
</P>
<P>
It reassures Latin America that it will not be abandoned as the United States 
and other Western governments rush to pour aid into Eastern Europe. What Bush 
offered the region parallels -- and in some ways outstrips -- what Eastern 
Europe is getting now. 
</P>
<P>
It comes at a time when a growing number of Latin American governments are 
moving toward free-market economic systems anyway and thus will find it far 
less onerous than they might once have. 
</P>
<P>
It carries the potential for important benefits for the United States as well. 
A bilateral free-trade accord with the major Latin American countries would 
result in far lower tariffs for U.S. exports to the region. That could spell 
the end of a 9-year slump in sales in Latin America by U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
From the Administration's own point of view, the proposal has the added benefit 
of not straining the federal budget. Apart from a $100-million-a-year outlay 
for the new regional investment fund, the plan relies on "trade, not aid" to 
bolster Latin economies. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, there is wide disagreement about how quickly and fully the region will 
prove able to take advantage of the proposal, both in terms of how rapidly 
individual countries will respond and how much they will be willing to abandon 
their current philosophy of central economic planning. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico has moved dramatically to reduce its dependence on state-run industries 
and protectionist trade policies, and Brazil announced sweeping new measures 
just this week. But most other Latin governments are still way behind. 
</P>
<P>
Argentina and Venezuela have only begun their reforms. And with the exception 
of Chile, which began shifting to a free-market economic system almost a decade 
ago, much of Latin America still depends on state-centered economies and is 
loath to give them up. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows that it's not going to produce immediate results," said Isaac 
Cohen, Washington director of the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America 
and the Caribbean, the region's most distinguished think tank. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the plan sends a clear signal -- that Washington has ended its 
diplomatic isolation from the region and is ready to be responsive if the Latin 
governments want to take advantage of the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
It also marks a turning point in the evolution of U.S. policy toward the 
region. In the 1960s, Washington was intent on providing foreign aid. That was 
replaced by commercial bank lending in the 1970s and by International Monetary 
Fund lending in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
What Bush did on Wednesday was to say that those days, too, are gone, and IMF 
lending will be replaced by trade and investment that the Latin American 
countries themselves will have to attract. 
</P>

"Bush has set the trade agenda with Latin America for the 1990s," Cohen said.

That is essentially the same deal that the United States and the other major 
Western powers are offering to Eastern Europe. "And it is a lot more 
sustainable," Cohen said, "than the policies that were pursued before."

IN EAST, DEALER TUNES UP FOR SALES OF VWS

<P>
With bright Volkswagen and Audi flags fluttering outside, and a perimeter fence 
freshly painted baby blue, it's hard to miss Sven Erkner's auto repair garage 
amid Ruedersdorf's drab surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
As the head of one of a new network of VW dealerships planned for East Germany, 
Erkner, 28, says he knows the competition will be tough, but he's ready. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got an advantage over others because I've concentrated on VW and know 
the car," he said in an interview. "We've already got a lot of orders." 
</P>
<P>
Erkner's garage is a rare family business that managed to survive a crippling 
87% business tax imposed by the Communist authorities. In part, it was 
tolerated because it serviced the Soviet Embassy's fleet of Ladas -- business 
that helps explain the photo of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev amid the 
array of semi-nude Czech calendar pin-ups and Volkswagen auto engineering 
diplomas that cover the walls of Erkner's small office. 
</P>
<P>
In a stroke of auspicious timing, Erkner two years ago gave up his Communist 
Party membership and his job as a salesman in the Department of Foreign Trade 
and returned to the family business that he had once rejected as a place with 
no future. 
</P>
<P>
Because his grandfather once worked at the VW plant in Wolfsburg, he studied 
the car carefully and has the diplomas to show it. His knowledge gleaned from 
selling East German goods in the West has given him an understanding of bank 
credits and other elements of Western finance. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to build a 16 by 20 meter (52 ft. by 65 ft.) glass showroom and 
expand the repair and service area," Erkner said with a confident smile. 
</P>
<P>
"The boom we expect (in auto sales) after July 1 will be followed by a trough," 
he predicted, but there wasn't an ounce of doubt in his voice. "I'm sure we'll 
make it. All we have to do is work hard."

CIA SEES CHINA FACING RENEWED UNREST; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE AUSTERITY CAMPAIGN LAUNCHED IN 1988 TO STEM INFLATION HAS ANGERED 
WORKERS AND WORSENED UNEMPLOYMENT, THE U.S. REPORT SAYS.

<P>
The CIA, in a strikingly gloomy portrait of the situation in China, said 
Thursday that the world's most populous country faces the prospect of renewed 
social unrest because of angry workers and mounting unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
In its annual report to Congress on the Chinese economy, the CIA said that 
chances for a quick return to the market-oriented reforms of the 1980s are 
"dim" and that the country's social stability is "tenuous." Unemployment in 
China is now at its highest level in a decade and urban living standards are 
declining, it said. 
</P>
<P>
The CIA report directly contradicts the repeated public claims of the Chinese 
regime that the reforms continue and that the political climate there is calm. 
On Monday, the day China allowed renowned dissident Fang Lizhi to leave the 
country, Premier Li Peng spoke glowingly of what he called the "growing 
political and economic stability in China." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. intelligence report, however, suggests that if there is new disorder 
in China, it may come not from the Chinese students and intellectuals who 
spearheaded last year's pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tian An Men 
Square, but rather from masses of disgruntled workers and jobless migrants. 
</P>
<P>
"According to many accounts, layoffs have created an embittered and volatile 
class of unemployed," the CIA asserted in a section entitled "Economic Problems 
Threaten Social Stability." 
</P>
<P>
". . . The growing number of unemployed and underemployed poses a social 
problem, whether they return to the countryside or stay in the cities. In 
addition to disturbances in the workplace, the growing pool of idle workers has 
produced a rise in the level of crime nationwide." 
</P>
<P>
According to the CIA, China is being forced to devote increasing resources to 
the job of maintaining order. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the intelligence agency explained, although the regime is 
increasing defense spending by more than 15% this year, "a significant portion 
of the increase . . . will go to purchasing new equipment, such as riot-control 
gear for military rapid-reaction units, and repaying the operational costs 
incurred by the military in enforcing martial law in Beijing and Lhasa during 
1989." 
</P>
<P>
China's economic problems stem from an austerity campaign launched by the 
regime in the fall of 1988. In an effort to reduce inflation, the leadership in 
Beijing clamped down on bank credit, cut back on investment projects, reimposed 
some price controls and brought to a halt the efforts to let prices be 
determined by market forces. 
</P>
<P>
The CIA said that China's drive succeeded in slowing down inflation, which 
dropped from annual rates of nearly 30% in late 1988 to less than 5% early this 
year. But the intelligence agency said that the austerity program was so 
restrictive that it "caused China's worst economic slump in a decade." 
</P>
<P>
"Workers are disgruntled, because they believe they are bearing the brunt of 
Beijing's austerity measures; many are receiving only about 70% of their 
expected wages and no bonuses, which have traditionally accounted for about 
one-third of workers' incomes," the CIA declared. 
</P>
<P>
". . . Some workers have complained that the current belt-tightening is the 
worst they have experienced since the early 1960s, when China was recovering 
from the disastrous Great Leap Forward." 
</P>
<P>
The CIA contended that China's austerity program has treated only the symptoms 
of China's economic instability, rather than the underlying cause -- the fact 
that the reform program launched a decade ago under the leadership of Deng 
Xiaoping was stopped halfway before it achieved the efficiencies of a market 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last few years, the CIA said, a number of economic reforms have been 
either frozen or "abandoned," including proposed changes in China's pricing 
system, banking, bankruptcy and foreign trade policies. 
</P>
<P>
"Political support for reform has been weakened by leadership squabbling and 
the removal of two reform-minded party general secretaries in the past three 
years," said the intelligence agency. It was referring to the Chinese Communist 
Party's ouster of party secretary Hu Yaobang in 1987 and of his successor, Zhao 
Ziyang, after the upheavals in Beijing last year. 
</P>
<P>
"While it is unlikely that many senior officials want to return to the command 
economy and isolationist policies that dominated China before 1979, there are 
those in the leadership who want to place strict limits on the non-state sector 
and to increase the party's role in enterprise management." 
</P>
<P>
During a hearing on the CIA report Thursday by the congressional Joint Economic 
Committee, one scholar, Nicholas R. Lardy of the University of Washington, 
disputed the agency's contention that China's economic reforms are being 
abandoned. Although China is now in a serious economic slump, Lardy said, 
"there has been very little evidence of a wholesale retreat from the reform 
measures adopted a decade ago." 
</P>
<P>
Another scholar, Harvard University Prof. Dwight H. Perkins, argued that for 
the moment, China is so paralyzed that it has no economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
"Those making economic policy are waiting for the fundamental questions of who 
will rule to be resolved," Perkins said. "And those currently ruling are 
reluctant to move for fear of a popular reaction that would undermine their 
ability to rule."

Chinese who desecrate the national flag can be imprisoned for up to three years 
under a law passed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's first flag law, adopted by the Standing Committee of the National 
People's Congress, also forbids the use of the emblem in advertisements or as a 
trademark, the official New China News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Willful damage to a flag is punishable by up to three years of imprisonment, 
detention, surveillance or deprivation of political rights. 
</P>
<P>
The new law takes effect Oct. 1, China's national day.

CEASE-FIRE WITH S. AFRICA NEAR, ANC LEADER PREDICTS

<TEXT>
<P>
The African National Congress and the white-led government could soon negotiate 
a cease-fire and end decades of hostilities, a top ANC official predicted 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President F.W. de Klerk declared six neighborhoods open to all races 
as part of the government's plan to ease 40 years of strict residential 
segregation. 
</P>
<P>
The six relatively small neighborhoods include one suburb each in Johannesburg 
and Cape Town, a rural area outside Durban and parts of three small towns -- 
Knysna, Messina and Zuurbekom, the government said. The government opened four 
neighborhoods to all races in November. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Slovo, an ANC leader and the head of the South African Communist Party, 
said the government and the ANC would seek to work out a cease-fire once they 
resolve several preliminary issues. Those include the return of 20,000 ANC 
exiles and the release of about 3,000 activists convicted of politically 
motivated crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a good chance that if the obstacles are removed we will at a very 
early stage move toward . . . the negotiation of a suspension of hostilities," 
Slovo said in an interview with the Associated Press and several other news 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The question of violence has been one of the most contentious issues between 
the government and the ANC as they seek to launch discussions on drafting a new 
constitution and ending apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
The government has called on the ANC to renounce its largely dormant guerrilla 
campaign in order to improve the climate for negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, who hosted ANC leader Nelson Mandela at the White House on 
Monday, also urged the organization to disavow violence. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela and other ANC leaders continue to support the armed struggle, 
saying it is necessary to maintain pressure on the government and also as a 
measure of self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC, the country's largest opposition group, has not carried out any major 
attacks this year. Dozens of anti-apartheid demonstrators have been killed by 
police fire during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
The government and the ANC held their first talks in May. The two have since 
worked together on a document to remove the obstacles to full-scale 
constitutional negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The government says it approves of the document, while the ANC has requested 
until July 10 to respond.

Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Gene McNary suggested 
Thursday that the federal government consider providing loans to Nicaraguans 
who fled the civil war in their country but now want to return home and rebuild 
the nation's economy. 
</P>
<P>
During a breakfast interview with Times reporters and editors, McNary said that 
the installation of an elected democratic government in Nicaragua has presented 
the United States with an opportunity to create "a blueprint for similar 
situations as they develop . . . around the world." 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that 100,000 to 170,000 Nicaraguan refugees reside in the United 
States, concentrated in Miami and other parts of South Florida, where "they've 
become a part of the community." Because they no longer are facing political 
persecution, McNary said, they have become "economic refugees." 
</P>
<P>
"The question is, can we allow that to happen . . . ?" he said. "Once a 
situation is dissolved and the reasons for a refugee to be taken into another 
country is eliminated . . . don't we have to indicate to those people that it's 
time to go back so that we have the resources to help others who are political 
refugees?" 
</P>
<P>
Answering his own question, McNary continued: "We're not going to be able to 
alter our standard to include economic refugees. So that forces us, in my 
judgment, into some way to return the refugee but hopefully to bring about a 
stabilizing effect." 
</P>
<P>
McNary stressed that nothing has been decided and that his thoughts are "just 
pure discussion." He said that he and "a bunch of eggheads on a think tank" 
have been kicking around the idea of identifying leaders in Nicaraguan 
communities around the United States and providing them with money to rebuild 
their country. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the U.S. government has seen its foreign aid to Central American 
countries "going into the hands of corrupt governments and not really being 
used for elevating the country economically or socially or in any other 
respect," McNary said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that "some very capable people came out of Nicaragua" and said that 
the United States could identify those people and provide loans to help them 
create businesses and institutions that could generate much-needed capital for 
the war-torn country. 
</P>
<P>
In commenting on another issue, McNary said that the U.S. Border Patrol will 
step up efforts to dissuade people from smuggling aliens into this country by 
fingerprinting persons apprehended when illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico 
border at San Diego and jailing repeat offenders. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to identify the smugglers, fingerprint them, put them in detention, go 
for a deportation order and . . . deport them," McNary said. "This is just a 
matter of enforcing a law that I don't think has been enforced before for 
various reasons, mostly because of a lack of resources by the INS." 
</P>
<P>
McNary refused to say when the effort would begin, but he noted that 
enforcement of the stricter measures "will probably be gradual." 
</P>
<P>
Currently, illegal aliens captured by the Border Patrol are offered a hearing 
to determine whether they should be deported. Most reject the hearing and are 
sent across the border immediately. That process, McNary said, allows aliens to 
make repeated attempts to sneak into the country. 
</P>
<P>
"We let them out the back door and . . . they're back in the same day," he 
said. "We have to be able to create a deterrent down there." 
</P>
<P>
Under the tougher procedure, the fingerprints of illegal aliens will be taken 
and filed, making it possible to identify and prosecute repeat offenders, 
shifting the problem from an immigration issue to a legal matter.

COURT BARS EXECUTION OF BOLLES' KILLER BUT OKS DEATH PENALTY LAW

<P>
The Supreme Court permanently blocked the execution of an Arizona killer 
Thursday, a day after upholding the death penalty law under which he had been 
sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
One attorney general called the sequence "a complete fluke." 
</P>
<P>
Two of the justices who voted with the majority in the 5-4 decision upholding 
the state law did not take part in Thursday's action, turning Wednesday's 
dissenters into a 4-3 majority for the one case. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief order, the justices refused to reinstate the death sentence of John 
Harvey Adamson, who was convicted of murdering Phoenix newspaper reporter Don 
Bolles in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals threw out Adamson's death 
sentence after striking down a provision in Arizona law that lets judges, 
instead of juries, choose between life and death for convicted murderers. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court's ruling called into doubt the validity of death penalty laws 
in Idaho and Montana, which also allow for sentencing by judges. But the 
Arizona provision was declared constitutional Wednesday by the Supreme Court in 
the case of another Arizona killer. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's confusing turn of events came about because Justices Sandra Day 
O'Connor, a former state judge in Arizona, and Anthony M. Kennedy, a former 9th 
Circuit judge, did not participate in Adamson's case. 
</P>
<P>
That left only Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White 
and Antonin Scalia voting to grant Arizona's appeal and set aside the 9th 
Circuit court's ruling in the Adamson case. 
</P>
<P>
Justices William J. Brennan Jr., Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John 
Paul Stevens, who voted Wednesday to strike down Arizona's death penalty law, 
voted to deny Arizona's appeal in the Adamson case. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that both the 1988 appeals court ruling and a contradictory 
Supreme Court decision are on the books. The practical effect is that Adamson 
cannot be sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona Atty. Gen. Bob Corbin said: "As we see it, the Arizona death penalty 
statute is constitutional . . . but it doesn't apply to Adamson. It's a crazy 
decision, but that's what they voted." 
</P>
<P>
Idaho Atty. Gen. Jim Jones called the sequence of events "ridiculous" but 
predicted that Thursday's action would affect no Death Row inmate but Adamson. 
</P>
<P>
"It really means not too much more than Adamson is going to get off because of 
a complete fluke, and the work of the judges of the 9th Circuit court," Jones 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Adamson was paid $100,000 to attach a bomb to the car of 
Bolles, who had been investigating organized crime for the Arizona Republic in 
Phoenix. Bolles died on June 11, 1976, nine days after his car exploded. 
</P>
<P>
Before dying, Bolles identified Adamson as the man who had made an appointment 
to see him the day of the bombing.

CUT CORPS OF GENERALS 7%, CHENEY ORDERS; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: THE DECISION IS GREETED WITH APPLAUSE ON CAPITOL HILL. LAWMAKERS CALL 
FOR EVEN MORE REDUCTIONS IN THE MILITARY'S TOP BRASS.

Extending the pain of planned defense cutbacks to the military's most senior 
ranks, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney moved Thursday to trim the nation's corps 
of generals and admirals by 7% over the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, noting that military personnel cuts must start "at the top," ordered 
the services to cut 78 of 1,073 general and flag-rank officer positions by 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
But the reduction will spare the military's top brass from the deep cuts facing 
the ranks below them. Cheney has slated overall reductions of at least 14% in 
military manpower and the cuts could be as much as 25% among enlisted and 
junior officers. 
</P>
<P>
While Congress in recent years has directed cuts in the senior officer corps, 
Pentagon experts said that Thursday's announcement appeared to mark the first 
time in decades that a defense secretary has ordered such reductions. 
</P>
<P>
On Capitol Hill, where lawmakers have called for large reductions in military 
manpower, Cheney's decision was greeted with applause and calls for even deeper 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased to see it," said Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), ranking Republican on 
the Senate Armed Services subcommittee on manpower and personnel. "It just 
makes sense that as you reduce force size and weapons, there should be less 
requirement for flag and general officers. In fact, there should be less 
requirement for generals than there are for sergeants. 
</P>
<P>
"But there will be more," McCain added. "There will be larger reductions (in 
senior officers) made by Cheney or mandated by Congress. These cuts should be 
comparable with, if not deeper than, overall cuts in the forces." 
</P>
<P>
In a related move, Cheney also ordered reductions of 15% in the Joint Staff, 
the group of officers that advise and perform staff work for the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
The combined reductions in the senior ranks are likely to most heavily affect 
the Washington area, where generals, admirals and joint staff officers are 
concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
Although some lawmakers have charged that the officer corps has become bloated 
during years of peace, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams defended the decision 
to trim the top brass to 995. He said that the current head count of 1,073 
generals and admirals already is far below the 1,435 recommended by a private 
commission last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Every one of these is going to be a difficult, agonizing decision. We're not 
talking about a big universe" of officers, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Williams said that the Pentagon would try to reduce the numbers by not 
replacing admirals and generals as they retire. But additional steps might be 
necessary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think retirement and attrition are going to do it," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, which does not require congressional approval, the Army 
will lose 33 of its 407 generals, the Air Force 27 of 338, and the Marine Corps 
three of 70. The Navy will lose 15 of 258 admirals by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The breakdown reflects the changing role of the military services and their 
budgetary prospects in the coming cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
The number of generals in the Army and the Air Force, whose major commitments 
in Western Europe will be reduced in response to the fall of former East Bloc 
Communist governments, will be cut by 8% each. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy, whose traditional role makes it an important force in Third World 
conflicts, will lose only 6% of its flag-rank officers. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 20 positions will be eliminated by the end of 1991, an additional 20 
in each of the next two years, and 18 in 1994, Williams said.

Jurors deliberating the fate of the third young man to be tried in the 
Bensonhurst racial slaying announced Thursday that they were deadlocked over a 
verdict in the racially charged case, but the judge told them to keep trying. 
Appearing tired and frustrated, the jurors told state Justice Thaddeus Owens on 
the fourth day of their deliberations that they could not reach a consensus on 
several of the counts against John Vento, charged with murder for allegedly 
helping recruit a white group that killed a black teen-ager. Both juries in the 
previous Bensonhurst trial announced in the middle of their deliberations that 
they were deadlocked, and both eventually reached verdicts.

HOUSE BACKS BILL TO REPLENISH NUTRITION PROGRAM

Thousands of poor women and children being cut from a popular federal nutrition 
program because of a shortage of funds would be reinstated under legislation 
approved Thursday by the House. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved on voice vote, boosts the amount states can borrow against 
next year's allocation of funds from 1% to 3%. 
</P>
<P>
The change in rules for the Special Supplemental Feeding Program or Women, 
Infants and Children, known as WIC, is expected to prevent almost 250,000 women 
and young children from losing all benefits for the rest of the current fiscal 
year, which ends Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
"This is about children," said Rep. Tony P. Hall (D-Ohio), chairman of the 
House Select Committee on Hunger. "Every dollar we spend on the WIC program 
saves $3 later in health care costs." 
</P>
<P>
The nutrition program provides either food or vouchers usable at local stores 
for poor women who are pregnant or nursing and their babies and small children. 
</P>
<P>
"They face malnutrition. They face anemia. They face bad health problems," Hall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Unexpectedly high food prices used up so much of the $2.1 billion appropriated 
nationwide for this year that some states have started reducing their caseloads 
by eliminating all but the most desperate participants. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of WIC Directors said this week that 250,000 women and 
children would be eliminated by September if $72 million was not found for this 
year. The 3% borrowing capacity would infuse $66 million into the program, if 
fully used. 
</P>
<P>
A total of about 4.5 million women and children are enrolled in the program.

CONFEREES BREAK DEADLOCK ON OIL SPILL BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Senate and House negotiators broke a months-old deadlock Thursday and cleared 
the way for final passage this summer of legislation to help prevent and clean 
up oil spills as well as impose higher liability payments on tanker owners. 
</P>
<P>
House conferees yielded to the Senate and dropped a House-approved provision 
that would have enforced two international treaties that set liability limits 
for oil spills by ocean tankers and establish a global fund to compensate for 
damages, up to a specified ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate delegation unanimously opposed the treaties on grounds that the 
liability limits were too low and that the international agreements -- never 
ratified by the Senate -- would have the effect of replacing stiffer federal 
and state laws on oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
Two other major issues remain unresolved: establishing timetables for requiring 
double hulls on tankers and barges and setting the upper limits of liability 
for ship and cargo owners. A conference was scheduled for July 12 -- after the 
congressional recess for the Fourth of July holiday -- in hopes of reaching 
agreement on those items. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident we can resolve the other issues and pass a bill this year," said 
Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), a participant in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration favored the House approach on grounds that it would 
give better protection against oil spills originating outside the three-mile 
U.S. territorial limit and would not subject tankers to state laws providing 
unlimited liability. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Democratic leader George J. Mitchell of Maine led the fight against the 
House provision, which would have implemented the treaties even though the 
Senate has not ratified them. 
</P>
<P>
"Only the tiniest fraction of vessels," he said, would be covered by the 
treaties that would not be covered by federal or state law. "The purpose of the 
protocols (treaties) is to preempt federal and state law." The House, however, 
voted against federal preemption of state laws concerning oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Mitchell argued, the House provision would have shifted 
responsibility for oil spills from those responsible for them to the American 
taxpayers, who would contribute to the international fund. Sen. Max Baucus 
(D-Mont.) said the international agreements -- concluded long before the Exxon 
Valdez spill off Alaska -- were "outdated" and should be renegotiated before 
the United States accepts them. 
</P>
<P>
Under the international agreements, which have been ratified by 41 countries, 
those hurt by an oil spill may first seek compensation from insurers for the 
responsible party, with a ceiling of $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
The applicants may then seek up to $260 million from an international fund 
supported by the signatory nations. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Gerry E. Studds (D-Mass.), chairman of the House negotiators, said he was 
relieved to have the issue resolved even though his compromise proposal was not 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
The strong Senate stand and the unwillingness of the House negotiators to 
change their position had led some lawmakers to believe that the dispute might 
scuttle the legislation during this session of Congress.

HOUSE VOTES TO DENY FUNDING FOR MISSION TO EXPLORE MOON AND MARS

<P>
Ignoring protests by President Bush, the House voted Thursday to deny money for 
the proposed space exploration mission to the moon and Mars. 
</P>
<P>
Bush had requested $309 million for preliminary work on the moon-Mars mission, 
but nearly all of the money was left out of the $83.6-billion 1991 
appropriations bill for the space agency and various other agencies and 
departments, including the departments of Housing and Urban Development and 
Veterans Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The House passed the bill on a 355-48 vote after an attempt by Rep. Robert S. 
Walker (R-Pa.) to restore $267 million for the mission was ruled out of order 
on a procedural point. Walker argued that the space exploration project is "an 
important initiative to this nation's future." 
</P>
<P>
The bill now goes to the Senate, where the Administration may try to restore 
money for the program. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, in a June 20 visit to the Marshall Space Center in Huntsville, Ala., 
criticized the House Appropriations Committee, which had voted against the 
funding, for "pulling the plug" on the mission. Cutting the funds showed "not 
everyone on Capitol Hill shares this commitment to investing in America's 
future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During debate on the bill, Rep. Bob Traxler (D-Mich.) defended elimination of 
the moon-Mars funding, saying it was made necessary by the "very, very 
difficult financial times" faced by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Traxler noted that the overall increase for the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration is the largest in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Appropriations Committee and the House voted to eliminate the 
moon-Mars mission funds, the bill provides an overall 17% increase in NASA's 
appropriation over the current year. The total for NASA is $14.3 billion. Bush 
had sought 5% more than the bill provides. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the bill is $2.3 billion for the space station, which is $195 
million below Bush's request, and $114 million for the national aerospace 
plane, $5 million less than the request. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief debate, the managers of the bill accepted an amendment to 
eliminate $6 million for the NASA program that searches for evidence of 
extraterrestrial intelligence.

NUNN SEES MILITARY ROLE IN AIDING ENVIRONMENT; 
</P>
<P>
PENTAGON: HE SAYS DEFENSE DEPARTMENT ASSETS CAN HELP IN CLIMATE RESEARCH, 
POLLUTION CLEANUP AND TOXIC AND RADIOACTIVE WASTE DISPOSAL. 
</P>

<P>
With defense cutbacks looming and environmental concerns soaring, the chairman 
of the Senate Armed Services Committee Thursday proposed a new strategic 
program that would bring military assets to bear on environmental research and 
pollution cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech on the Senate floor, Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) endorsed using the 
scientific expertise, supercomputers and other high-technology equipment of the 
Defense Department and the Energy Department's nuclear weapons laboratories for 
climate research, pollution cleanup, and disposal of radioactive and toxic 
wastes. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn, regarded as one of the Senate's most influential members, said that he 
and other committee members will push for creation of a new Defense 
Environmental Research Council when they meet next month to begin work on the 
$295-billion defense authorization bill for 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the disintegration of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe in 
recent months, Nunn said that he is convinced "there is also a new and 
different threat to our national security emerging -- the destruction of our 
environment. The defense establishment has a clear stake in countering this 
growing threat. I believe that one of our key national security objectives must 
be to reverse the accelerating pace of environmental destruction around the 
globe." 
</P>
<P>
The concept of classifying environmental protection as a national strategic 
objective was proposed by Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) in a 1989 speech to 
the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Gore, a member of the Armed Services panel, joined Nunn in outlining ideas for 
using defense resources for environmental work as part of a Strategic 
Environmental Research Program. 
</P>
<P>
Military aircraft and naval vessels, he said, "could be of invaluable 
assistance" in collecting atmospheric and ocean data needed by scientists who 
are constructing computer models used to study the greenhouse effect and global 
climate change. 
</P>
<P>
Gore said that he has had a series of conversations with officials involved 
with the Strategic Defense Initiative about using its supercomputers for 
climate modeling work. SDI already has been cut back dramatically from its 
original concept as a continental missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn said that the first task of the new Defense Environmental Research Council 
would be to develop a comprehensive five-year program for research affecting 
the national security. 
</P>
<P>
"Our real peace dividend will consist of the research talent that will be made 
available as our defense establishment is reduced -- thousands of highly 
trained and educated scientists, engineers and technicians," Nunn told the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
"As our defense requirements change, we have an opportunity to redirect this 
tremendous national resource toward the environmental challenges we face in the 
1990s: understanding what we are doing to the environment today, cleaning up 
the damage we had done in the past and modernizing U.S. industries and 
government to establish and maintain technological leadership in this critical 
area in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, Nunn said that he will propose to include in defense legislation 
the authorization for the Pentagon and Energy Department to undertake programs 
in the fields of data collection and analysis, development of alternative 
energy technologies and environmental cleanup technologies. 
</P>
<P>
The two agencies already have responsibility for some of the nation's most 
staggering environmental cleanup problems -- radioactive pollution of nuclear 
weapons sites belonging to the Energy Department and massive toxic pollution of 
military bases about to be closed in the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"U.S. technologies for more effective identification, treatment, and cleanup of 
hazardous wastes will find ready markets in other countries, particularly in 
the newly emerging democracies of Eastern Europe and in Third World countries," 
Nunn said. 
</P>
<P>
"Development of these new technologies will also help DOD and DOE meet their 
environmental cleanup and treatment obligations more quickly and more 
efficiently and at lower cost."

Luke Sampson, an Inupiat Eskimo from the arctic coastal village of Kotzebue, 
would have preferred to be home this week, hunting beluga whales from an open 
boat in the Chukchi Sea. Instead, he has been spending his days 1,000 miles 
away in the state Capitol, sitting through legislative hearings and patroling 
statehouse hallways. 
</P>
<P>
"They need to know how important our way of life is," said Sampson, a part-time 
local government bureaucrat. Like many people in rural Alaska, he supports his 
family through a mixture of cash jobs and living off the land and water -- 
everything from whale, caribou and salmon to berries picked by the bushel from 
the tundra. 
</P>
<P>
"It's how people in the villages survive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sampson is one of many voices being heard here this week as the state 
Legislature debates a question that has split Alaskans for the past three 
decades -- should some residents have more hunting and fishing rights than 
others? 
</P>
<P>
In a state where thousands of far-flung residents head off into wilderness the 
way many Americans go to the grocery store, and where cities are filled with 
recreational hunters and fishermen, the debate has been loud and passionate. 
</P>
<P>
On one side are the state's largest native organizations, representing Alaska's 
80,000 Eskimos, Indians and Aleuts. They argue that people living outside 
Alaska's cities, particularly natives, deserve special subsistence hunting and 
fishing rights, including longer seasons, higher bag limits and first crack at 
fish and game in times of shortages. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the core of these people's existence," said Julie Kitka, president of the 
Alaska Federation of Natives. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side are the National Rifle Assn. and a variety of statewide 
hunting and fishing organizations, who argue that city dwellers should have the 
same access to fish and game and people in villages. 
</P>
<P>
"The story in Alaska is that everybody else has won -- big oil, big money, big 
environmental groups -- and the sportsmen have taken it in the pants," said 
Rupe Andrews, the Alaska field representative of the NRA. He and others believe 
the state could change laws to give people in cities equal access to natural 
resources without hurting those in the villages who depend on fish and game. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature was called into special session this week by Gov. Steve Cowper 
to try to untangle an increasingly complicated web of court decisions and 
mandates from the federal government on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Until last year, state law had a system of allowing people in rural areas to 
have special rights. But a group of Anchorage-area sport hunters filed a 
lawsuit contending the law denied them the chance to live subsistence 
lifestyles, and the state Supreme Court agreed, ruling the law was 
unconstitutional because it discriminated against city residents. 
</P>
<P>
Cowper, a Democrat, supports special rural rights and wants to amend the state 
constitution to allow them. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the right thing to do," Cowper said. "That's one of the values in Alaska 
that we treasure, that if you opt to live in the rural areas of Alaska, then by 
all rights, since you're not living in the cash economy, that you should have 
the first cut at the resources out there." 
</P>
<P>
But opposition has been fierce, especially from legislators representing 
Anchorage, Fairbanks and other communities with large numbers of sport hunters. 
The outdoors groups insist they are not trying to deny anyone the opportunity 
to live off the land, only that everyone should have the same chance. 
</P>
<P>
There have not been many direct conflicts between sportsmen and natives, but 
the number of clashes has been growing. Last year, a federal court gave natives 
the right to put a subsistence net in the Kenai River, which attracts sport 
fishermen from throughout the world hoping to hook giant king salmon. 
</P>
<P>
A group of sport fishermen, afraid the net would cut into their fishery, 
cruised by the net waving rods and nets in the air in protest. A group of 
native commercial fishermen were arrested last summer for allegedly threatening 
a group of out-of-state sport fishermen at gunpoint, claiming they were taking 
fish to which natives were entitled. 
</P>
<P>
Clouding the whole matter is the fact that more than 60% of Alaska is federal 
land -- representing half of all the federally owned land in the nation. And 
federal law requires special subsistence rights for rural residents in Alaska, 
and the takeover of fish and game management on federal lands if the state 
doesn't guarantee it. 
</P>
<P>
The Department of Interior is scheduled to take over game management on all 
federal land here on Sunday, creating two separate sets of hunting rules. At 
first, federal policy will not be appreciably different from the state, and 
Washington is leaving fish management in state hands for the time being. But 
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. has said an entirely new management scheme 
will eventually be developed, one that the governor and the state's 
congressional delegation believe will be far more restrictive for everyone 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
The sport hunting groups, meanwhile, filed another lawsuit last week, 
contending the federal law discriminates against them, and they want the state 
to sue, too. Legislators representing rural areas say such a suit would be an 
insult to natives, and lawmakers have been fighting about the issue all week. 
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, an unusual coalition was emerging, with at least two oil companies 
and other powerful industries here -- who often work in partnership with 
native-owned corporations -- joining natives such as Sampson in lobbying in 
favor of the rural preference. They're supported by the state's Republican 
congressional delegation.

FIREFIGHTING NETWORK WAS OVERWHELMED; 
</P>
<P>
RESPONSE: IT TOOK HOURS TO DEPLOY FIREFIGHTERS UNDER MUTUAL-AID AGREEMENTS BUT 
ONLY MINUTES FOR HOMES TO BECOME ENGULFED.

At 3:30 Wednesday afternoon a five-engine "strike team" from the Long Beach 
Fire Department was dispatched to the Carbon Canyon fire in Orange County. The 
two-dozen firefighters stayed only about an hour before being told to pull out. 
The Santa Barbara fire had exploded, and units were needed there. 
</P>
<P>
Thus were engine companies from throughout the state deployed in fits and 
starts Wednesday under a system of mutual-aid agreements between federal, state 
and local fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
The "Firescope" network, run out of an office in Riverside, has been honed for 
years and provides maximum flexibility. However, no system makes up for the 
fact that it takes several hours to drive a fire engine from Orange County to 
Santa Barbara and only minutes for a wind-propelled firestorm to eat a house. 
</P>
<P>
And this was why hundreds of homeowners in Santa Barbara could spill tears over 
their dwellings' ashes Thursday and John Bryant, a U.S. Forest Service 
deployment expert in the government's Riverside nerve center, could still say, 
"It was a pretty fair day." 
</P>
<P>
After all, Bryant had spent Wednesday and a couple of hours after midnight 
Thursday deciding how to mobilize one-third of the 5,000 firefighters who 
battled five major blazes from San Diego to Santa Barbara. No one, civilian or 
firefighter, had lost a life trapped by flames in the chaos. 
</P>
<P>
This might have struck some of those on the battlefront as too sanguine a 
response, considering the immense damage caused by the blazes. Yet the common 
conclusion Thursday was that nature, as it so often does during brush fire 
season, had once again defeated tactics. Too many fast-moving fires had struck 
Southern California on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials, looking nervously ahead, said the firestorms underscored the 
fact that drought-induced conditions have made mountain brush as dry as it 
usually is by September or October, the peak fire months. 
</P>
<P>
"We're as prepared as we can be . . . but the way it is today, we can get 
overwhelmed real quick," Los Angeles City Fire Chief Donald O. Manning told a 
news conference where he pleaded with residents to avoid using Fourth of July 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
"The brush is so dry today -- due to the drought -- that we don't even have to 
have a wind to have a disaster. Certainly, even just a sparkler could start a 
fire," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Barbara on Thursday, Chuck Wagner, Santa Barbara County's chief 
administrative officer, complained that retardant-dropping aircraft were not 
available until dawn Thursday because the aircraft usually based near Santa 
Barbara had been dispatched to fight blazes that broke out earlier in the day 
to the south. 
</P>
<P>
But then he admitted that the speed of the fire made the criticism moot. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire moved so fast and had such a heat and intensity to it, the front was 
actually skipping 200 to 300 yards. Because of the wind and intensity of the 
heat and dry brush, it basically came down the mountain and was into the 
residential area before there was time to do anything but evacuate people," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner estimated that it took the fire, which started at 6:02 p.m., about 45 
minutes to get to the residential areas. He said that other fire agencies from 
Ventura, Los Angeles, Long Beach and other cities began arriving around 8:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Johnston, the forest service safety officer at the Santa Barbara fire, 
bemoaned the lack of manpower. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have the people and equipment to put in there," he said Thursday as 
he watched fire force the evacuation of one neighborhood. "People here have 
been working 24 hours and they're just shot. There were so many fires in the 
Western U.S., we just couldn't find people." 
</P>
<P>
"In the initial stages we were responding to four or five major fires," said 
Bryant, who for the last 11 years has been the emergency operations coordinator 
for the forest service's southern zone, which covers everything that has burned 
this week in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"In Santa Barbara it was almost impossible to get enough resources to the fire. 
It's a two-hour drive from Los Angeles and we were trying to get heavy 
equipment up there. We just couldn't get equipment in there fast enough," 
Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant's job involves playing chess with fires after holding periodic 
conference calls with fire chiefs in counties that are aflame. The strategy is 
to move engine companies from throughout the state to major fires, throwing 
enough resources to do the job without leaving other areas unprotected. 
</P>
<P>
The mutual-aid system was responsible for providing 1,400 of the 5,000 
firefighters on duty this week. Plans were being made Thursday to send up to 
1,600 more firefighters to Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"The hard part," Bryant said Thursday, "is that it (the fire) changes every 10 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday afternoon the system had sought help outside California in only 
one instance. Four C-130 aircraft, retrofitted with a 2,000-gallon tank 
containing water and retardant, were brought in late Wednesday and put into use 
Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the C-130s, firefighters are using DC-4s and helicopters. They 
are also deploying 19 Grumman S-2 airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the state Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention said the 
state was worried that there are only three S-2s left in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't like to let the number in Northern California get so low," she said. 
So they are rotating some of the S-2s to Northern California and replacing them 
with C-130s. 
</P>
<P>
Baker reported from Los Angeles and Boot from Sacramento.

AID TO BUSINESS -- AND FEAR OF TOURISM EFFECT; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE REBUILDING WILL EMPLOY CONTRACTORS, LENDERS AND INSURANCE 
ADJUSTERS. AND HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS WILL BENEFIT FROM THE DISPLACED. BUT 
VISITORS MAY STAY AWAY.

<P>
As contractors and lenders ready for the rebuilding that lies ahead and hotels 
and restaurants fill with displaced residents, firefighters and armies of 
insurance adjusters, the devastating Santa Barbara fire has left the area with 
a tragic business boomlet. 
</P>
<P>
But behind confident official predictions that tourists will still flock to the 
picturesque beach town, there is worry that the seemingly endless drought and 
devastating fire will hurt one of Santa Barbara's most important industries -- 
tourism -- at least for a time. In the end, residents say they will rebuild and 
get on with life, just as they did after the last big fire in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
"When things aren't right in paradise, people want to know why," said Ed Caro, 
president of the California Restaurant Assn.'s Santa Barbara chapter. "But we 
will rebound quickly here in Santa Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
The fire that blasted an area just west of Santa Barbara did its worst work on 
homes -- destroying more than 500 of the county's 75,000 houses. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the businesses destroyed were small mom-and-pop operations, including 
such Santa Barbara institutions as the Philadelphia House restaurant and nearby 
Eller Donuts. Some of the area's large nurseries also were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Contractors and lenders began gearing up for more business than they have seen 
in a long time because of generally sluggish conditions in the building 
industry coupled with the city's official no-growth philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"Now that it's happened, the job is to get it cleaned up as fast as we can," 
said Mike Lee, owner of Lee Construction in Santa Barbara. Lee warned that the 
1977 fire, which destroyed more than 200 homes, drew many unscrupulous 
operators who bilked victims anxious to rebuild quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara hotel operators, who typically see 90% summer occupancy rates, 
expect the fire to have little effect on business. 
</P>
<P>
"It may scare some tourists away this weekend, but as far as the impact on the 
business, that'll be taken up by people who were displaced from their homes," 
said Ron Derrico, general manager of a Holiday Inn. Several insurance companies 
are sending agents into the area and they, too, will fill hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Derrico reported his motel's 156 rooms occupied Thursday, in part by residents 
forced from homes. 
</P>
<P>
Guests at the Cathedral Oaks Lodge, about half a mile from burned areas, 
included firefighters and police officers. Lee Ann Davis, a desk clerk at the 
hotel, expected to rent all 126 rooms Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels were offering hefty discounts to those forced from their homes. The 
Holiday Inn charged $50 a night for rooms normally priced at $110. The Santa 
Barbara Inn billed guests $60 a night, compared to $149 or $169. 
</P>
<P>
"We're giving people rooms for just what it costs to clean them," said desk 
clerk Joe Cabe. 
</P>
<P>
But when residents find someplace else to stay and insurance adjusters go home, 
will tourists return to fill the rooms? 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara Chamber of Commerce Director Steve Cushman says yes, predicting 
minimal damage to an industry that makes up 30% of the area's economy. 
</P>
<P>
"People are still playing volleyball on the beach . . . and eating and carrying 
on as usual," said Caro, director of human resources for Carrows Restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
But some are concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"Things like the drought and the threat of fire could definitely alter people's 
plans to make us a stop on their vacation or weekend trip," said Gary Dorothy, 
owner of Stampa Barbara, billed as the world's largest rubber stamp store. 
</P>
<P>
Said one local business executive, who noted fewer tour buses in town: "People 
are going to say, 'Drought, fire, it's just trouble. Let's not go to Santa 
Barbara . . . dear. Let's go to San Francisco,' " 
</P>
<P>
Zena Drewisch, executive director of the Santa Barbara Board of Realtors, lost 
her house in the 1977 fire, Thursday was coordinating volunteers who were 
helping displaced residents find shelter. "People rebuilt and went on from 
there" 13 years ago, she said. "I imagine people will rebuild again."

VICTIMS RUSH TO SEE IF LOSSES ARE FULLY COVERED; 
</P>
<P>
INSURANCE: ADJUSTERS GET READY AS RESIDENTS CHECK WHETHER THEIR POLICIES ARE 
ADEQUATE TO REPLACE HOMES THAT HAVE SOARED IN VALUE IN RECENT YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Victims of Wednesday's devastating fires were scrambling Thursday to determine 
whether their insurance coverage is adequate to replace homes that have soared 
in value over the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, insurers said they were readying teams of adjusters to fly into the 
hardest-hit areas of Southern California to handle claims in what has already 
become one of the costliest fire seasons in years. 
</P>
<P>
"From what we understand from the fire department, this is probably the worst 
brush fire season in recent memory," said Dick Donegan, regional underwriting 
manager for Allstate Insurance Co. in Glendale. "After four years of drought, 
it looks like this is going to be a very rough year." 
</P>
<P>
It could turn out to be rougher still for consumers who have failed to update 
their insurance policies, particularly in fire-prone areas of Southern 
California. The last fire of this magnitude destroyed 216 homes in Santa 
Barbara 13 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials later estimated that insurance covered only about 60% of 
the losses that fire victims suffered in the so-called Sycamore Canyon Fire of 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
A lot has changed in the past decade, though. Agents said Thursday that the 
bulk of the fire victims they have contacted have full coverage, largely 
through "replacement value" clauses that have become popular in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
However, these clauses vary dramatically from insurer to insurer. Some will pay 
the costs of all damages, regardless of how much they exceed the policy limits. 
Others only guarantee that personal items will not be depreciated to current 
market value and instead will be replaced at original cost. Some damage waivers 
can be rendered completely ineffective by policy limits. 
</P>
<P>
Fireman's Fund, for example, says replacement value coverage applies only when 
policy limits equal at least 80% of the value of the home. In other words, a 
$100,000 house insured for $40,000 would get no benefit from the policy. But if 
it were insured to $80,000, the replacement coverage would kick in, said John 
Kozero, a Fireman's Fund spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Allstate's Donegan, on the other hand, says anyone who has purchased 
replacement coverage with Allstate is fully covered "no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
"If you have replacement cost coverage, and your house is insured to $100,000 
but it costs $300,000 to rebuild it, you are still fully covered," Donegan 
said. "There is no cap." 
</P>
<P>
Transamerica Insurance Co. estimates that 72% of its customers have replacement 
value coverage on the structures of their homes and more than 90% took out the 
coverage for contents, said Richard Olsen, a company vice president. 
</P>
<P>
The percentages vary at other companies, but many of the largest insurers in 
the state said that at least half of their policies included some inflation 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
Those most at risk for inadequate coverage are the people covered by the 
California FAIR Plan, a cooperative insurance pool that provides fire insurance 
to high-risk houses in brush areas. FAIR, whose name stands for Fair Access to 
Insurance Requirements, provides coverage only up to the policy limits and will 
pay for lost items only at their depreciated values, regardless of their 
current replacement costs, said Mike Harris, a plan spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Already the plan has received 23 claims, mostly from the Glendale blaze, Harris 
said. But many of those policyholders have additional "wrap-around" coverages 
with other insurers, he noted, adding that the average local FAIR Plan customer 
has $275,000 in coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, insurers were flying adjusters into fire-plagued parts of California 
to help assess damages. And agents said they were already writing checks to 
fire victims to help them cover living expenses and new clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are sending out checks for $5,000 even without seeing the property," said 
Ed Hurd, marketing manager at Manchester Insurance Agency in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Despite predictions that 1990 will be one of the worst years in recent history 
for fire damage, insurers said consumers are not likely to see near-term rate 
hikes. Fire insurance rates are determined over 10- and 20-year periods, a 
practice that eliminates annual gyrations for especially disastrous years, 
Donegan said. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, homeowner policies that include fire insurance coverage cost between 
$75 and $200 a year for each $100,000 in coverage, depending on location and 
specifics of the policy, insurance agents said. And although wood-shake roofs 
have been cited as one of the biggest factors in determining how much fire 
damage a home will sustain, none of the insurers contacted Thursday said they 
charged more for policies on houses with wood-shake roofs. However, several 
insurers said they might decline a policy application if the home were in a 
brush area.

ELMER S. JONES; BANNER MAKER HELPED DESIGN L.A.'S FLAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Elmer S. Jones, flag, banner and bunting maker to Southern California and the 
world, has died. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
Jones died Wednesday at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital, where he was recently 
hospitalized. He had been bedridden for the last six months because of 
complications from a broken hip. 
</P>
<P>
Before his hip fracture, Jones had worked steadily five days a week at his 
Jones Decorating Co., 2807 Sunset Blvd., which he founded in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
"His work was his life," said Alfredo Rubalcava, Jones' stepson, who also works 
at the decorating concern. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Illinois, Jones moved to Los Angeles in the early 1920s, sleeping in 
the park or bunking with a friend until he found a job. 
</P>
<P>
He was hired at 35 cents an hour by a decorator to festoon a new Elks Club in 
Oxnard for its dedication, and decided there was enough money in the parade and 
event decorating business to make that his lifework. 
</P>
<P>
After his boss went bankrupt when a client failed to pay, Jones took over the 
business and set it up under his own name in 1926. He adopted the ambitious 
advertising slogan "Jones Does Everything," later refined to "Just the Best." 
</P>
<P>
Within a year Jones hit the big time when he was hired to festoon Los Angeles 
city streets for the visit of Charles Lindbergh after "Lucky Lindy's" historic 
flight across the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
That same year, Jones created electrical floats for a Boulder Dam parade in Los 
Angeles, and in 1928 he hung airplanes over the streets for the National 
Aeronautical Exposition and Air Races and decorated City Hall for its 
dedication. 
</P>
<P>
In 1931, Jones helped design the current flag for the city of Los Angeles, 
incorporating its newly designed seal in a three-color background of yellow, 
green and red as part of its mammoth 150th anniversary celebration. 
</P>
<P>
In 1932, he decorated streets, buildings, stores, City Hall and the Coliseum 
for the Olympics. When the games returned to Los Angeles in 1984, Jones was the 
official purveyor of Olympic flags, pennants and other memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
Jones put the special decorating touches on Pasadena for the Tournament of 
Roses for 40 years (1932-72), and decorated for some of the Academy Awards 
presentations, the Orange Show in San Bernardino and the 1935 San Diego 
Exposition. 
</P>
<P>
Dabbling in politics, Jones festooned Gilmore Field for a speech by President 
Harry S Truman in 1948, hung the bunting for the 1960 Democratic National 
Convention in Los Angeles, and made British flags for the visit of Queen 
Elizabeth II in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a World War I Navy veteran, manufactured 100,000 code flags for the Navy 
during World War II and decorated the scene of 100 Army and Navy award 
ceremonies. During the Vietnam War, he sent hundreds of California state flags 
to servicemen who requested them through Gov. Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
As the demand for parade decorating declined, Jones shifted part of his energy 
to a year-round Christmas store patronized primarily by film studios. The 
operation was a spinoff of his many years of decorating Broadway's flagship

MORNING BRIEFING: VINCENT HAD NO ANSWER FOR LOCKOUT, EITHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent was the keynote speaker Thursday at the 
Associated Press Sports Editors convention in Boston. After his speech, he 
answered questions from the floor. Some of the topics: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On gambling, the only offense that carries a ban from the game: "The 
gambling rule in baseball, somewhat like the rule for street crime in Saudi 
Arabia (cutting off the offender's hands), works." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On former umpire Dave Pallone's recent allegations that several major 
league players are gay, and whether gay players are welcome in the game: "If a 
gremlin could play second base and play it well, I'm sure we'd have one owner 
who would sign him." 
</P>
<P>
 -- On how he might treat Pete Rose, whose lifetime ban for gambling soon will 
reach the one-year mark, making him eligible for an appeal: "One of the great 
insights in life is that one should not decide tomorrow's questions today." 
</P>
<P>
Add Vincent: The commissioner also told the editors that he enjoyed a good turn 
of phrase, recalling a line written late in the career of Irish Meusel, who had 
long been uncooperative with the press but increasingly cooperative as his 
retirement approached: "Meusel learned to say hello when it was time to say 
goodby." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Thursday's trivia dealt with the number of Celtic and Laker 
players in the Basketball Hall of Fame. Can you name the Hall of Famer who 
played for both teams? 
</P>
<P>
Home-pit advantage: On this day in 1956, USC's Charlie Dumas became the first 
person to high-jump seven feet when he cleared 7 feet 0 5/8 inch in the U.S. 
Olympic trials at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Who has extras?: Sheri Richardson, 29, of North Myrtle Beach, Va., was the 
first to have her name picked in this week's lottery for tickets to the 1991 
NCAA basketball Final Four, which drew a record-breaking 143,829 applicants for 
47,500 seats at the Indianapolis Hoosier Dome. 
</P>
<P>
She must have been ecstatic, right? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really a basketball fan," Richardson said at a news conference on the 
front steps of the Hoosier Dome. "I have a friend that goes to Indiana 
University who I met last summer when we worked in a restaurant. He sent me the 
application and said this would be a chance for me to come up and visit him." 
</P>
<P>
Her friend, graduate student Dave Milne of Fort Wayne, Ind., said: "I hope she 
lets me use the second ticket. Maybe I'll take it now so that if we're not 
still friends, she won't give it to someone else." 
</P>
<P>
The modern game: Johnny Pesky, 70, hired Wednesday to manage the Boston Red 
Sox's triple-A Pawtucket franchise, revealed how he'll handle the struggling 
PawSox: "I like to let the player do what he can and we go from there. I'm not 
going to make any changes. I think the product is there." 
</P>
<P>
Up everyone's alley: Looking for a bowling league? Mario Fox of the Associated 
Press reports that Marigold Lanes, located three blocks from Wrigley Field on 
Chicago's North Side, has 30 leagues. Among them are a Japanese league, a 
Puerto Rican league, a janitors' league, a gay league, a lesbian league, a 
tavern league, four hospital leagues, a children's "bumper" league (no gutter 
balls), black leagues and an advertising league. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a league called the Marigold Straits. Said one of its members, 
architect Fred Schmidt: "We had a gay league bowling in front of us and another 
after us. We just wanted to define ourselves, but we spell it differently." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Clyde Lovellette, with the Minneapolis Lakers in 1953-57 and the 
Boston Celtics in 1962-64. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Pittsburgh Pirate pitcher Walt Terrell, after hearing that Nolan 
Ryan had pitched his sixth no-hitter despite a broken bone in his back: "I'll 
try it. First I'll have to find out what bone I have to break, then I'll just 
jump off a building." TED BROCK

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: ABC SET TO PRESENT A FAMILIAR FACE IN A FEW DIFFERENT 
PLACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
ABC introduced one of its new sportscasters the other night, a fellow named 
Brent Musburger. 
</P>
<P>
He had a small role, barely more than a cameo, on a prime-time show called "The 
All-Pro Sports Awards." 
</P>
<P>
At least Musburger showed up at the Universal Amphitheatre, where the event was 
held. Seven of the 11 winners were no-shows. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Shoemaker called in sick. The others simply chose the easy way out -- 
appearing on tape or live via satellite. Even some of the presenters appeared 
via satellite. 
</P>
<P>
Technically, the show was well produced. But something needs to be done about 
how the winners are selected. Bo Jackson was named the baseball player of the 
year, Andre Agassi the men's tennis player of the year. Really. 
</P>
<P>
Oh well, it was the first time this event has been held. Maybe things will 
improve. 
</P>
<P>
As for Musburger, he soon moves on to bigger and better things. Well, at least 
a little bigger and better. 
</P>
<P>
Next is a harness race, the Hambletonian, on Aug. 4, then the Little League 
World Series on Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's college football and basketball, and next spring comes minor 
league football, something called the World League of American Football. 
</P>
<P>
Going from the real World Series to the Little League World Series doesn't seem 
to bother Musburger. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, maybe a little. "I would have liked to have had the opportunity to show 
America I wasn't going to destroy baseball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Musburger was smiling, joking, enthusiastic and personable during an 
interview the other day before a World League of American Football news 
conference at a Beverly Hills hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't be happier the way things worked out," he said. "Now I'm with 
somebody who wanted me. 
</P>
<P>
"Say I had signed for another five years with CBS. Knowing what I know now, it 
might not have been a happy five years." 
</P>
<P>
Musburger, you may recall, was fired by CBS on April 1, the eve of the NCAA 
basketball championship game. 
</P>
<P>
He said the firing isn't what bothered him. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, if two guys that run a network decide they don't want me, I can live with 
that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
What got to Musburger were stories in the New York Daily News and the New York 
Post after his firing that said, among other things, Musburger was difficult to 
work with. The accusations were attributed to unnamed sources. 
</P>
<P>
Musburger, during an earlier telephone interview, said that's when he decided 
to go on ABC and NBC to speak his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"That was one way to put an end to the anonymous sources," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Musburger replaced Howard Cosell as the sportscaster some people love to hate. 
</P>
<P>
But there's a big difference between Cosell and Musburger. Cosell may be even 
more obnoxious in person than he is on the air. Musburger is, all things 
considered, a decent person. 
</P>
<P>
He may rub a few people the wrong way, but from this vantage point, Musburger 
is easy to work with. 
</P>
<P>
He has been criticized here on a number of occasions, but that doesn't keep him 
from being civil, or even sitting down for lunch from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had a problem with the media," he said during the phone interview. 
"You guys have a job to do. I understand that. I used to be a sportswriter. 
You're not going to create much interest if you always say just nice things. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been aware of it when you, or someone else, takes a shot at me. But I've 
got more important things to worry about -- my family, my business. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a grown boy. I just don't get that upset." 
</P>
<P>
Musburger said he's also aware that the criticism directed at him doesn't come 
just from the media. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there are people out there who hate me. I'm not one of those guys who 
stay in the middle. I'm not vanilla. I have opinions and I express them. And 
sometimes I get criticized for it." 
</P>
<P>
Musburger, before the news conference the other day, said he has enjoyed his 
time off. "It's been the most time I've spent with my family in 27 years of 
marriage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Musburgers have a home in Weston, Conn., near New York, but these days 
spend most of their time at a relatively new home in Savannah, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
Musburger, 51, has two sons -- Blake, a junior at Miami of Ohio, and Scott, a 
junior at a prep school in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
Blake suffers from spina bifida, a congenital disorder of the vertebral column. 
He wears a lift on his left foot, but Musburger said, "It's not a severe case 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
Musburger comes from Billings, Mont., where his father owned appliance stores. 
Musburger attended a boarding school in Faribault, Minn., during his high 
school years. He said it was his mother's idea, but he enjoyed it. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to Northwestern but was expelled in his freshman year. "There was a 
rule against a freshman owning and operating a car on campus, and I broke it," 
Musburger said. 
</P>
<P>
He went to umpiring school and spent one season, 1959, in the minors, earning 
$250 a month. 
</P>
<P>
"I could have made $325 a month my second year, but my father talked me into 
going back to Northwestern," Musburger said. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad advice. He got a degree in journalism, worked for a while as a 
sportswriter in Chicago and then got into broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sports packager Warren Williamson has made a deal for KIEV to carry Loyola 
Marymount basketball, beginning next season. Randy Rosenbloom and Williamson 
will be the game announcers, and Jim Rome, who has a Santa Barbara radio talk 
show, will serve as host. The campus station, KXLU-FM, which can be heard 
throughout the western part of Southern California, will continue to broadcast 
the Lions' games, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Vic (the Brick) Jacobs, recently told by Channel 13 that his contract will not 
be renewed, became a part of Rick Dees' popular KIIS-FM morning show, and on 
Sunday, he'll work with Rosenbloom on SportsChannel's delayed coverage of the 
L.A. Games basketball championship. The game is at 3 p.m., the TV coverage at 
8:30 p.m. . . . Also, Jacobs and Mad Dog Russo of New York's WFAN, have a pilot 
called "Greatest Sports Headlines" that will be televised on Channel 2 Sunday 
at 3 p.m. "Hey, I'm on Tony Hernandez's old station," Jacobs said. Hernandez is 
Jacobs' replacement at Channel 13. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Jacobs has gone from television to radio, he may have to find a new 
nickname since he can't be seen throwing bricks on radio. Jacobs said he has 
what he calls a "magic twanger." He used to throw his brick when he was angry, 
but he said he'll use his twanger only for positive things. 
</P>
<P>
The CBS baseball game Saturday, the Oakland Athletics at the Toronto Blue Jays, 
is a national telecast, so Los Angeles viewers will finally get the No. 1 
announcing team of Jack Buck and Tim McCarver. . . . CBS radio has named Vin 
Scully as its World Series play-by-play announcer. He'll work with Johnny Bench 
and CBS Radio regular John Rooney. 
</P>
<P>
CBS has picked up another major sporting event, taking the PGA Championship 
away from ABC, beginning in 1991. It was also announced that Turner 
Broadcasting will cover the first two rounds. . . . Earlier this week, CBS 
announced it has acquired the rights to Big Ten basketball games, beginning in 
the 1991-92 season. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 34 is attracting about five times as many viewers for its World Cup 
coverage as TNT. One big plus for the Spanish-language coverage is the lack of 
commercial interruptions. . . . Another reason the World Cup ratings on TNT 
have been poor is that a lot of soccer followers, particularly English fans, go 
to pubs to watch the games. 
</P>
<P>
ABC's coverage of the 23-day Tour de France begins this weekend with a preview 
on Saturday's "Wide World of Sports," and delayed Sunday at 3 p.m. . . . 
Another season of "American Gladiators" is being filmed at the Universal 
Studios for later showing. Mike Adamle is back as one of the hosts, and Larry 
Csonka has replaced Todd Christensen as the other. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent item in this column about a dispute over whether Keith Olbermann of 
Channel 2 or Joe McDonnell of KFI radio had the first report on developments in 
the Pat Riley story, two clarifications should be made: (1) Olbermann's report 
was similar in subject matter to McDonnell's, but more extensive, and (2) 
Olbermann's report during the 1988 Olympics did not "accuse" Florence Griffith 
Joyner of taking steroids, but rather "implied" that that was the case when he 
ran side-by-side pictures of her in 1984 and 1988.

A heavily-favored Green Thumb Farm entry of Flirty and Past Remembered made it 
look easy by running one-two in the $39,000 grass allowance feature Thursday at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Although both four-year old fillies were owned by Green Thumb Farm, the winner 
Flirty was trained by Edwin Gregson and ridden by Gary Stevens. Past Remembered 
is trained by J. 'Paco' Gonzalez and was ridden by Patrick Valenzuela.

NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM GRANT PACT APPROVED; 
</P>
<P>
MUSEUMS: THE INSTITUTION HAS RETURNED $64,000 TO THE NATIONAL SCIENCE 
FOUNDATION IN A DISPUTE OVER ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History has agreed to return nearly 
$64,000 to the National Science Foundation, ending a dispute over museum 
accounting procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation, which last November had declared the natural history museum 
ineligible for new government grants, contended the funds were improperly 
spent. The grant ineligibility, which lasted until May 18, was the first time 
the National Science Foundation had ever imposed the severe suspension penalty 
on a museum. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the county Board of Supervisors has called off discussions 
concerning the merger of the museum and the county Arboreta and Botanic Gardens 
-- apparently acting to quell protests among support groups for the separate 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The county board action came Tuesday when a motion to terminate the merger 
study by Supervisor Mike Antonovich was approved without debate. It occurred 
after top museum officials -- conceding that protest had been overwhelming 
among community and support groups -- asked that the proposal be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
"In light of the concern . . . the (museum) board of trustees is opposed to 
such a merger," said a letter from the museum to Supervisor Pete Schabarum, the 
board chairman. "We believe it would not be in the best interests of either 
institution and that, if merged, both could suffer in the loss of goodwill and 
support from the community." 
</P>
<P>
The termination of merger discussions represented the second setback in less 
than three years for the natural history museum in attempts to take over other 
facilities. In 1987, it tried to absorb the private Southwest Museum in Mount 
Washington, but the proposal was abandoned in the wake of outraged protests by 
community groups led by City Councilman Richard Alatorre. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Craig Black, the museum's director, said Black would not 
comment on the abortive arboretum merger beyond what he and two top board 
officials said in the letter to Schabarum -- dated May 31 and released by the 
museum Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Existence of the merger proposal was disclosed in April by The Times after a 
series of discussions between the museum and county Chief Administrative 
Officer Richard Dixon. The merger talks apparently had their origin in 
previously undisclosed discussions dating to April of 1989 in which the museum 
proposed that it take over the arboretum department. 
</P>
<P>
The arboreta agency includes the state and county arboretum in Arcadia, 
Descanso Gardens in La Canada Flintridge, the South Coast Botanic Gardens in 
Palos Verdes and the Virginia Robinson Estate in Beverly Hills. The museum 
complex includes the main facility in Exposition Park and the George C. Page 
Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits. 
</P>
<P>
The merged organization would also have provided new facilities for the Western 
Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology, an internationally known collection of bird 
science materials originally incorporated by Ed N. Harrison, president of the 
natural history museum's county-appointed board of governors. 
</P>
<P>
After the merger discussions were revealed, a variety of arboretum support 
groups launched a concerted protest, led by Alice Frost Thomas, president of 
the California Arboretum Foundation. The arboretum groups branded the takeover 
attempt a "land grab" and demanded that it be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, arboretum supporters apparently got everything they asked for when 
the supervisors approved Antonovich's motion to discontinue a feasibility study 
of the merger and to launch a nationwide search for a new arboretum director. 
The previous director, Francis Ching, retired earlier this year. Ching and 
arboretum supporters have contended he was forced out by the supervisors 
because he would not agree to the merger. 
</P>
<P>
"We realized we were about to be swept under the rug and no one was doing 
anything about it," Thomas said Thursday. She said arboretum support groups 
enthusiastically supported the board action terminating the merger study. "I 
just hope we can rapidly get a new director," she said. "We really are without 
much direction at the moment." 
</P>
<P>
At the National Science Foundation in Washington, meanwhile, officials released 
a copy of the May 18 agreement between the foundation and the museum that 
terminated what had been an acrimonious dispute between the two organizations 
over the natural history museum's grant eligibility. The museum was declared 
ineligible after a science foundation audit last year found numerous accounting 
deficiencies at the museum and demanded return of as much as $254,000 in 
government grants. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement disclosed in the agreement released by the science foundation 
earlier this week indicated that the federal agency was satisfied with 
alterations in the museum's accounting procedures. The amount of money the 
museum actually had to return was $63,601. The museum and the science 
foundation also signed a new agreement on rates the museum is entitled to 
charge on government grants to recover its indirect costs devoted to the 
research. 
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased that we have signed an agreement that meets our mutual best 
interests," said Black, who is the only museum director on the National Science 
Board -- the science foundation's governing body. "We look forward to 
continuing our cordial relationship."

KOREAN BARBECUE PALACE IS MANNA FROM ROSEMEAD

"It tastes like fish," the woman at the next table said tersely to her dining 
companion. 
</P>
<P>
"Be serious," he said in obvious exasperation. "Chicken. It tastes exactly like 
chicken." 
</P>
<P>
The conversation heated up. At first I hesitated, but finally I just had to 
know. "Pardon me," I said, standing to peer over the etched-glass partition 
separating our booths, "um, just what is that you're arguing about?" 
</P>
<P>
"No. 60," she said, with an embarrassed smile. 
</P>
<P>
"Try it -- it's really quite good," he added, "and you can have the deciding 
vote." 
</P>
<P>
With an offer like that, who could resist? I ordered No. 60 as well as a dish 
of spicy cold noodles and a large Sapporo beer. 
</P>
<P>
It's not unusual to quibble over Korean food. Alternately salty or bland, sweet 
or sour, hot or bitter -- and frequently all at the same time -- the unusual 
tastes can provoke widely varied reactions. 
</P>
<P>
Manna Korean BBQ, a pleasant outpost in a mini-mall at the southeastern tip of 
Rosemead, can serve as a good introduction to this "exotic" cuisine. Perhaps 
the best way is to take a group of friends and plunge right in. (If your group 
is large enough, you can reserve one of four rooms with low Japanese tables, 
tatami mats and shoji screens for privacy -- leave your shoes outside. If not, 
you'll be seated in a red-leather booth with a hwaro, or barbecue grill, on the 
table.) 
</P>
<P>
This is a barbecue palace, so start with the grilled combination appetizer: 
beef, oysters, green onions, carrot, zucchini and shrimp in egg batter. Twice 
when I've ordered it, the chef threw in some unidentified pieces of whitefish 
as well. It comes, as do most dishes, with small plates of cold spicy noodles, 
cold bland noodles, spicy cucumber, sweet marinated onions and carrots, sweet 
and spicy kim chee, cold spicy tofu and pickles. Radishes, cucumbers and bean 
sprouts also appear in various configurations. 
</P>
<P>
The grilled shrimp are delicate, slightly oily -- and delicious. The oysters 
are mashed into a cutlet and are more like a Maryland crab cake, chewy, 
slightly undercooked and addictive. 
</P>
<P>
Next up, fun food: the combination barbecue platter. After bringing over a 
heaping plate of raw beef, shrimp, pork, squid and chicken, the waitress dumps 
a sample on the grill -- and leaves you to fend for yourself. You cook it, you 
decide when it's ready, and when and what to add to the fire. It comes with all 
the side dishes listed above (as well as the occasional odd lot from the 
kitchen such as cold, sweetly marinated sweet potato slices). 
</P>
<P>
The BBQ platter is, quite simply, a blast. Slop it on, burn it, turn it, fight 
for the biggest or best piece -- eating Korean barbecue is a sloppy, enjoyable 
communal experience. The dishes are distinctive; each has been marinated in its 
own sauce, each has its own flavor. Soy sauce is usually the base; garlic is 
very discernible in most of the meat sauces, as is a concentrated type of 
sesame oil on others. Red chili peppers, mustard and vinegar find their way 
into many dishes as well. Kochujang, a type of chile paste, is often used on 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
Get an order of heumit gui to add to the mix, just to get the deliciously 
salty, reduced vinegar-and-soy sauce that comes with it. The large pieces of 
sliced beef tongue are tender and a treat -- and nothing like the pickled 
tongue of Jewish delicatessens or roast lengua of Cuban and Mexican fare. 
</P>
<P>
Moving on from the barbecue dishes, opt for the gal bi chim, stewed beef ribs 
with sweet potatoes and onions. Brought to your table in a burning-hot metal 
pot, the meat is almost falling off the bones. Chopsticks are all you need. 
</P>
<P>
There are thick mixed seafood casseroles, hearty soups and a few noodle dishes 
as well. I was unlucky with the fish dishes I tried; yeon ou gui turned out to 
be incredibly overcooked salmon. 
</P>
<P>
All dinners include a fairly bland clear miso soup with kelp and a rice bowl. 
Leave room for your favorite dessert . . . at another restaurant later. They 
don't have any here. 
</P>
<P>
There is wine of unknown origin ("It's just red and white," as one waitress 
said), and better stuff can be found in high school chemistry labs. The Korean 
Ob beer is pretty good; better still, go with the oversized Sapporo bottles. 
Korean food will leave you thirsty. 
</P>
<P>
A note on service: Most of the waitresses are attentive and friendly, but there 
is at least one who will snap your head off if you don't order as soon as you 
sit down. Tread lightly. 
</P>
<P>
And what about good old No. 60? Well, I thought it tasted like rabbit. But then 
again, it was the first time I've ever had cow's foot jupsi -- steamed and 
served on the bone. And he was right about one thing: It is really quite good.

HOME TECH / VIDEOS: TWO EXPERTS TELL HOW TO PICK THE RIGHT TAPE FOR YOUR CHILD; 
</P>
<P>
CASSETTES: RESEARCH IS THE KEY FOR PARENTS SORTING THROUGH THE MAZE OF NEW 
TITLES ON THE MARKET. 
</P>

<P>
Summer vacation is a great time of the year for kids, but a tough one for many 
parents, who have to deal with them all day, every day. 
</P>
<P>
How do you keep youngsters entertained? Kidvid is one obvious solution. 
</P>
<P>
Among the flood of new titles in the stores: Strand VCI's "Thomas the Tank 
Engine and Friends," the Lyons Group's "Barney's Campfire Singalong," Legacy's 
"Super Speller Strategy," MCA's "Rock &amp; Read" and Hanna-Barbara's "Raiders 
of the Lost and Found" (featuring Yogi and his crew). Family Home 
Entertainment's animated "The Red Shoes" is due July 12. 
</P>
<P>
But walking into the children's section of a home-video store, facing shelves 
full of mostly unfamiliar titles, can be an unnerving experience for many 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
Which ones will the kids like? Is this one too sophisticated? Is that one too 
violent? Who's Barney and the Backyard Gang? Who's Lamb Chop? 
</P>
<P>
Even for longtime parents, it's hard to keep up with all the new titles. For 
new parents, it's tough to know where to start. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some guidelines from two experts on children's video: Loretta 
MacAlpine, children's video writer for the trade journal Video Insider, and 
Nancy Steingard, vice president of acquisitions for HiTops Video, one of the 
industry's foremost kidvid companies. 
</P>
<P>
Reviews. Regularly reading reviews of new children's videos in women's and 
family magazines and in newspapers is one of the best ways to keep up with the 
flow of new product and to help form judgments. MacAlpine recommended Family 
Circle, Redbook, Woman's Day, Parent's Choice Magazine and, particularly, a New 
York-based publication called Children's Video Report. 
</P>
<P>
Word-of-mouth. "Parents should talk to other parents and find out what they've 
seen and watched," Steingard suggested. "Find out what they recommend. They can 
often tell you about content and that will help you make judgments." 
</P>
<P>
Outside sources. Often, teachers and video-store personnel are good sources, 
MacAlpine said. "Pre-school teachers sometimes have seen a lot of videos," she 
added. "Check with video-store people and find ones that know the market -- 
whose judgment you can trust." 
</P>
<P>
Libraries. According to MacAlpine, some libraries have children's cassettes -- 
often for free. Library personnel will probably have screened the titles and 
most likely can offer guidance in making selections. 
</P>
<P>
Video companies. The market is flooded with companies putting out kidvid 
titles. But there are a handful of companies whose track records suggest that 
you can be fairly certain of getting quality. Disney, MacAlpine said, is the 
company best known for first-rate kidvid. Others that usually put out 
high-quality product, she said, are HiTops, Celebrity, Hanna Barbara, Family 
Home Entertainment and Random House. 
</P>
<P>
Awards. Some cassette packages bear stickers showing that the title has won an 
award. "If it's an award given by a recognizable organization -- one that 
you've heard of and respect -- you might be more inclined to give that one a 
try," Steingard said. 
</P>
<P>
Synopses. The descriptions on the back of the video box can be helpful. "Don't 
just trust the pictures on the box," Steingard warned. "They can be flashy and 
misleading. Take time to read the copy on the back. Sometimes it can be a 
decent guide. But read it with some skepticism because some of what you'll read 
is just hype. But some of it is fine. Sometimes that's all you have." 
</P>
<P>
According to MacAlpine, about 80% of the kidvid titles are animated. If you 
don't want your child to watch animation, you really have to sift carefully 
through the titles. In many cases, the non-animation pickings are very slim. 
</P>
<P>
MacAlpine advises parents to be somewhat adventurous in their selections and to 
take advantage of the incredible variety in the kidvid market. Her rule No. 1 
is to avoid renting or buying what kids see on Saturday morning TV. 
</P>
<P>
"They can see that every week," she said. "Look for original programming, for 
what they can't see on TV. . . . The real advantage to being familiar with 
what's on the market is that you find out about that interesting and different 
new video -- one that you might overlook if you didn't know to look for it." 
</P>
<P>
Most kidvid titles, Steingard said, are in the $10-$15 range. But often you'll 
find some that are well under $10. Beware of the cheapies, she warned. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see something that costs $3.99, who can resist it?" she said. "But 
unless you know about the title, you may get burned. There are a lot of 
fly-by-night companies out there exploiting the market. You may get it home and 
find that it's horrible quality. Ask yourself, 'Why is it that cheap?' 
Generally because there's something wrong with it somehow." 
</P>
<P>
What happens if you do make a poor judgment -- if, in spite of all your 
precautions, you buy a cartoon for your 3-year-old that's somewhat violent and 
more suitable for a 7-year-old? 
</P>
<P>
MacAlpine suggests screening whatever you buy before showing it to your kids. 
"Particularly with small children, take the time to check it out first to make 
sure it's not too sophisticated and violent for them," she suggested, noting 
that the recommended age range listed on the cassette shouldn't be regarded as 
gospel. "You know your child. Maybe there's something in the video that's OK 
for other children but not yours. Maybe there's something that's perfectly fine 
for an 8-year-old but for not for your 3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
"You may say you don't have time, but aren't your kids worth that extra time?"

'SANTA BARBARA,' TWO LATINO STARS TOP DAYTIME EMMY LIST; 
</P>
<P>
AWARDS: JOAN RIVERS REBOUNDS FROM FOX DEBACLE TO TAKE BEST TALK SHOW HOST 
HONORS. SUSAN LUCCI OF 'ALL MY CHILDREN' WAS A LOSER FOR THE 11TH YEAR IN A 
ROW.

NBC's "Santa Barbara" was named best drama series for the third year in a row 
and two of its Latino stars also walked off with awards Thursday at the 17th 
annual Daytime Emmy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
"Sally Jessy Raphael" won the Emmy as best talk show and PBS' "Reading Rainbow" 
was honored as best children's series in ceremonies held at the Marriott 
Marquis Hotel in New York City and broadcast nationally on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Rivers, whose late-night talk show flopped on Fox Broadcasting three years 
ago, was chosen daytime's best talk show host, even though her syndicated 
series, "The Joan Rivers Show," was not nominated. 
</P>
<P>
"I always had a fantasy about winning one of these," Rivers said in her 
acceptance speech. 
</P>
<P>
While handing out thank yous to her staff, she began to cry. "Two years ago, I 
couldn't get a job and my income dropped," she said. Then, alluding to her late 
husband, Edgar Rosenberg, who committed suicide in August, 1987, she said, 
"This is really for him. He was with me at the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
"Jeopardy!" was named best game show, and its host, Alex Trebek, shared the 
Emmy for best host with Bob Barker of "The Price Is Right." Trebek had won last 
year; Barker won in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A tie also was voted in the category of best animated program. ABC's "The New 
Adventures of Winnie the Pooh," which won last year, shared this year's award 
with another Saturday morning series on ABC, "Beetlejuice." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Emmy for best daytime soap opera, "Santa Barbara" also picked up 
awards for A Martinez as best actor, Henry Darrow as best supporting actor, 
directing and lighting direction. The NBC serial had won six Emmys last year. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Zimmer, who plays Reva Shayne Lewis on "Guiding Light," was named best 
actress in a daytime drama. Among the actresses she beat out was Susan Lucci of 
"All My Children," who has now been nominated for 11 consecutive years without 
winning. One of Lucci's co-stars, Julia Barr, won as best supporting actress. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, CBS won 12 Daytime Emmys and PBS captured 11 -- seven for "Sesame 
Street." Syndicated programs garnered 10, NBC got 9, ABC received 8 and the 
Disney Channel got 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Daytime Emmys, covering the period between March 6, 1989 and March 5, 1990, 
were presented jointly by the Los Angeles-based Academy of Television Arts 
&amp; Sciences and the New York-based National Academy of Television Arts &amp; 
Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
Awards for prime-time programming will be presented Sept. 16.

At least 14 people were killed and 33 wounded in the cocaine capital of 
Medellin, Colombia, when a car bomb exploded near a police station just as the 
city's new police chief was being sworn in, authorities said. No one claimed 
responsibility for the blast, but authorities blamed the Medellin drug 
traffickers, who have been waging a terror campaign. The bomb left a large 
crater and heavily damaged vehicles and buildings nearby.

An attorney for Paul Carpenter, who is under indictment from the FBI undercover 
investigation of alleged political corruption in the state Capitol, says the 
former state senator suspects that his telephone was illegally tapped and that 
someone broke into his home in Los Angeles County during the investigation. 
Attorney Jerrard Hinckley reported Carpenter's suspicions to U.S. Magistrate 
Esther Mix during a federal court hearing on routine pretrial motions. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they had no knowledge of any such illegalities, but promised 
to investigate. Hinckley said Carpenter found his home unlocked and lights on 
once about a year ago, and later saw a man working on a telephone pole near his 
home. "He was told a neighbor had a phone problem, but he checked . . . and 
none had complained of phone problems," Hinckley said. Carpenter, now a member 
of the State Board of Equalization, is to go on trial Aug. 13 on felony charges 
of extortion, racketeering and conspiracy.

<P>
An initiative aimed at limiting the terms of state elected officials, sponsored 
by Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, has qualified for the November 
ballot, the secretary of state's office announced. It would limit all elected 
state officials to two four-year terms except members of the Assembly, who 
would be limited to three two-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
Another initiative on the same subject, proposed by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de 
Kamp, also qualified. This one would limit state legislators and members of the 
State Board of Equalization to 12 years in office, would prevent future 
governors and other statewide elected officials from serving more than eight 
years and would sharply reduce the amount of money candidates could spend on 
elections. Among 11 other initiatives that also qualified by the deadline are 
proposals to protect timberlands, raise alcohol taxes, outlaw fishing with gill 
nets and allow state prisoners to work for private businesses.

FIREFIGHTERS STRETCHED TO COVER THE COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
FIRES: ALTHOUGH CREWS HAVE BEEN SENT TO BATTLE THE SANTA BARBARA BLAZE, LOCAL 
OFFICIALS SAY THEY ARE MAINTAINING ADEQUATE PROTECTION FOR THE REGION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At least 100 Ventura County firefighters have been dispatched to help battle 
the disastrous Santa Barbara fire, but officials said they have managed to 
maintain comprehensive fire protection throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is that we get everybody we possibly can to cover the local 
stations," said Sandi Wells of the Ventura County Fire Department. "We don't 
leave any part of the county uncovered, ever." 
</P>
<P>
By bringing virtually every firefighter on duty, the county Fire Department has 
maintained crews of at least one fire engine and three firefighters per truck 
at each of the county's 32 stations, Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
Also, firefighters with local city departments and other agencies are on 
standby to help if needed, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
On normal days, about 130 county firefighters, or nearly one-third of the 
385-member force, are on duty at any one time, officials said. Typically, 
county firefighters work three 24-hour shifts every nine days. 
</P>
<P>
But when emergencies occur, county firefighters join with city fire departments 
to activate a backup network to maintain the same number of engines and 
firefighters to cover local neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Such an emergency was called when county firefighters, already stretched thin 
by the brush fire in Ojai, were dispatched to Santa Barbara Wednesday 
afternoon. As of Thursday, 100 firefighters remained in Santa Barbara -- about 
one-quarter of the county force. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, about 200 county firefighters helped crews from the U.S. Forest 
Service, California Department of Forestry and Los Angeles County Fire 
Department fight the brush fire that consumed 585 acres near Ojai. As of 
Thursday, only seven county workers remained as part of the firefighting force 
in the Ojai hills. 
</P>
<P>
When emergencies occur, the county Fire Department dips into the mutual aid 
system. Under this plan, participating fire agencies make firefighters and 
equipment available to neighboring communities, call in off-duty officers to 
work at local stations, and often require firefighters and other employees to 
work overtime to maintain a full level of service. 
</P>
<P>
"We're stretched in the sense that we would have to bring in other outside 
agencies if we were to have another major fire in the county now," said 
dispatcher Lisa Hines. "But as for normal, everyday emergencies, we're fully 
covered." 
</P>
<P>
Under the system, fire departments from the cities of Ventura, Oxnard, Santa 
Paula and a volunteer contingent from Fillmore are assisting the county Fire 
Department in covering the county surrounding their areas. A six-member 
firefighting unit at Camarillo State Hospital is also available to help out. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Tejada, assistant to the executive director at Camarillo State Hospital, 
said the hospital's fire engine returned Thursday from filling in at a county 
fire station in Thousand Oaks. The hospital's water tank truck remained on duty 
at the Ojai fire. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura, the city's Fire Department sent one fire engine and three 
firefighters to Santa Barbara Wednesday, said information officer Barry 
Simmons. Off-duty firefighters were called to relieve those firefighters, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And an Oxnard fire engine, with three firefighters, was due to return from the 
Santa Barbara fire Thursday, said Battalion Chief Murray Glidden. Oxnard 
officials had also called in an off-duty crew to work overtime, filling in for 
the crew that was dispatched to Santa Barbara, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other county agencies also stepped in to aid Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday, the Sheriff's Department dispatched 38 deputies to assist 
authorities in Santa Barbara. By Thursday, all but nine of the deputies had 
returned to Ventura, a department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
County Fire Department spokeswoman Wells said the county was still standing by 
and was prepared to send to Santa Barbara those firefighters who have rested 
after the Ojai blaze, replacing workers exhausted from battling that fire. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of those things that is changing continually," Wells said. "We 
could end up sending more."

OUSTED ESCONDIDO CITY MANAGER IS HIRED BY OXNARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ousted Oxnard City Manager David Mora will be replaced by Vernon G. Hazen, a 
former city manager in Escondido who also was forced to resign his post last 
year, the City Council announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Hazen, 54, who was unanimously chosen by the council during closed-door 
meetings this week, will begin his new job Aug. 13. Mora, who was forced to 
resigned after a 3-2 council vote in December, ends his five-year tenure in 
Oxnard today. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant City Manager John Tooker will act as city manager in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a real people person," Councilwoman Ann Johs said of Hazen. "I think we 
need a people person in Oxnard." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Manuel Lopez said the council interviewed five candidates for the 
job but chose Hazen because he had the most experience as a city manager. 
Hazen's salary has not been negotiated, council members said. Mora earns 
$95,705 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The California native had been the top administrator of Escondido in north San 
Diego County since 1982 and earned $95,000 a year. He formerly was city manager 
in the Northern California towns of Mill Valley for seven years and Mountain 
View for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
Hazen resigned his post in Escondido in January, just hours before the council 
was scheduled to meet in closed-door session to consider firing him. 
</P>
<P>
Hazen lost the support of a majority of the council soon after two slow-growth 
council candidates -- Carla DeDominicis and Kris Murphy -- were elected, 
joining veteran Councilman Jerry Harmon to form the city's first slow-growth 
majority on the five-member council. 
</P>
<P>
He said Thursday that he resigned because the new council majority felt he 
could not carry out a slow-growth development policy after overseeing a very 
pro-growth policy under the previous council. 
</P>
<P>
Hazen said Escondido grew from a population of about 65,000 to about 104,000 
during his tenure. Despite the unceremonious circumstances of his departure, 
Hazen said he left Escondido on "amiable" terms. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido Councilman Ernie Cowan, who voted to keep Hazen, said the former city 
manager was forced to resign for purely political reasons. He said Hazen was 
"just tainted by the fact that he was the man, so to speak, of the previous 
council." 
</P>
<P>
Cowan called Hazen an innovator and said he "brought Escondido into the 20th 
Century." 
</P>
<P>
For the last year and a half, Hazen has worked as a private consultant, 
developing a general plan for a 23,000-acre planned community near Chula Vista. 
However, he said he sought the post in Oxnard because he missed working as a 
city manager. "I think it's a blood-related disease," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hazen has inherited a city plagued for the last three years with financial 
woes. The council this week avoided a $2.8-million deficit in the 1990-91 
fiscal year by cutting 18 1/2 staff positions and injecting the budget with 
$1.2 million in onetime windfall revenues. 
</P>
<P>
Hazen said he needs to further study the city's budgetary policies before 
making any suggestions on the budget. However, he said he would have supported 
a 5% utility tax increase, which city officials had hoped would solve the 
city's financial problems by generating $5 million annually. Voters rejected 
the tax measure June 5 by a 3-to-1 margin. 
</P>
<P>
Mora's ouster was supported by Johs and Councilwomen Dorothy Maron and 
Geraldine (Gerry) Furr, who blamed him for the city's financial woes. Maron 
also has questioned the concessions made to developers by Mora's staff to lure 
development to the city. 
</P>
<P>
After Mora's resignation, a group of Oxnard residents, including members of the 
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People and the Assn. of Mexican 
American Educators, accused the councilwomen of racial discrimination for 
forcing out the Latino city manager. More than 50% of Oxnard residents are 
Latino. 
</P>
<P>
The group called Community Concern launched a recall petition against Maron, 
saying she is unresponsive to their request to review the decision to fire 
Mora. The group has until July 13 to gather 9,300 signatures to qualify the 
recall measure for the November ballot. It has collected about 8,000, said 
Community Concern spokesman Ray Tafoya. 
</P>
<P>
Hazen said he does not speak fluent Spanish but has dealt with many issues in 
Mountain View concerning Latinos and Asians. 
</P>
<P>
"Ethnic diversity adds to the richness of the community," he said.

JUDGE SIDES WITH FOES OF HIRING BAN; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER IS GRANTED AGAINST AN ENCINITAS ORDINANCE 
THAT MADE CURBSIDE SOLICITING OF WORKERS ILLEGAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what an ACLU attorney called "a ringing defense of the Bill of Rights," a 
federal judge Thursday granted a temporary restraining order against a new 
curbside hiring ordinance in Encinitas on the grounds that it deprived migrant 
laborers and others of their right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
In a 15-page opinion, U.S. District Judge John S. Rhoades predicted that the 
ordinance enacted last month by the North County beach city would fail to pass 
constitutional scrutiny. He set a July 13 hearing on the merits of a lawsuit 
filed against the ordinance by the American Civil Liberties Union and a migrant 
advocacy group. 
</P>
<P>
The new ordinance went into effect Saturday, giving the San Diego County 
Sheriff's Department the power to cite persons who solicit day laborers on 
public property or along public streets. But the department said it would not 
enforce the law pending Rhoades' ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the ordinance have claimed that it abridges free speech and is aimed 
at ridding the city of its growing population of undocumented and documented 
laborers from Mexico and Central America by taking away their means of support. 
</P>
<P>
In rendering his decision, Rhoades alluded to an Encinitas City Council meeting 
in March in which officials discussed drafting the curbside ban. "Prior to 
opening discussion on the subject of transient issues, the minutes reflect that 
the Pledge of Allegiance was recited," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"As we all know, the pledge calls for 'one nation, indivisible, with liberty 
and justice for all.' In this case, 'liberty' is the operative word." 
</P>
<P>
Migrant laborers, he pointed out, were also included in the message delivered 
by the Pledge of Allegiance. "Implicit in the concept of liberty is the idea 
that people within our borders -- all people, regardless of their citizenship 
-- will have the freedom to pursue their basic needs. 
</P>
<P>
"This court believes, and the Supreme Court has recognized, that an 
individual's right to work for a living -- to enable him to obtain food and 
shelter, to support his family and to become a productive member of the 
community, is at the heart of every individual's understanding of the personal 
liberty this country guarantees." 
</P>
<P>
Betty Wheeler, an ACLU attorney who argued before the judge for the restraining 
order, said she was elated not only by the judge's decision, but by his 
impassioned analysis of the rights of free speech. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so eloquent. This is why people go to law school," she said. "When he 
was done, there was nothing left to be said. We anticipated the outcome, but we 
didn't anticipate such a ringing defense of the Bill of Rights. It says that 
the First Amendment still rings true in Encinitas." 
</P>
<P>
For more than 20 minutes, Rhoades grilled Encinitas City Atty. Roger Krauel on 
the city's claim that the ordinance was not a speech issue but one of conduct 
for which more relaxed constitutional standards apply. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also queried Krauel about the city's claim that the curbside hiring 
ban was necessary to ensure the success of a job center opened seven months 
ago. The center, sponsored by the city, matches documented workers with 
employers. 
</P>
<P>
Repeatedly, Rhoades asked Krauel to detail under what conditions the city would 
enforce the law, which carries a fine of $100 to $500. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you mean that, if my wife is on the beach and she decides she has to run a 
few errands so she tries to hire a baby-sitter on the next blanket, that she 
would be subject to a citation or arrest under your ordinance?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
"And do you mean that any conversation in the middle of the freeway or the 
street, in a public park or at the beach where you talk about employment, 
that's also a violation?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, your honor," Krauel responded repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to a state of emergency declared by Encinitas this spring because of 
its migrant problems, Rhoades said: "You can't violate the Constitution of the 
United States simply by calling a state of emergency." 
</P>
<P>
After the hearing, Krauel said he was unmoved by the judge's occasionally harsh 
tones. 
</P>
<P>
"I was prepared for what happened," he said. "Remember, it's the first step in 
a very long process. The judge was stating his opinions, not ruling on the 
merits of the case." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Encinitas City Council will call a special meeting before bringing 
its case to the July 13 hearing. "I think the City Council has always been 
interested in what the judge has to say," he said. "We'll call a meeting to 
decide what our next move is." 
</P>
<P>
As both sides filed from the courtroom, Peter Tobias smiled broadly, as if he'd 
won a million dollars. What he won on Thursday, Tobias said, was worth much 
more. 
</P>
<P>
Tobias, a 45-year-old Scripps Clinic biochemist who lives in Encinitas, was 
named a plaintiff in the ACLU suit. After becoming frustrated over the City 
Council's treatment of migrant laborers, he said he called a migrant advocacy 
group and offered his help. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them, 'This is ridiculous. I'm ready to go to jail,' " he said. "I'm 
just a believer in free speech and fair play. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, I drive down the same streets as the City Council members, and I don't 
see the problems associated with migrant workers they see. They just don't have 
the right to deprive people of their rights to free speech to deal with what 
the city considers to be a problem."

CITY COUNCIL USES CUTS, TAXES TO BALANCE BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council, during a marathon session Thursday, balanced a 
$470-million general fund budget for the upcoming fiscal year by adopting a 
string of still-undefined budget cuts and increasing numerous taxes and fees, 
many of which will be borne by the city's business community. 
</P>
<P>
Council members also reversed field and, after lengthy and often bitter 
discussion, restored funding to four organizations that promote the city as a 
tourist and business destination. 
</P>
<P>
While the council approved a $1.2-billion total budget for the fiscal year that 
begins Sunday, all but a few seconds of the seven-hour meeting was dedicated to 
covering a $38-million shortfall in the $470-million general fund. It is the 
general fund that provides for many municipal services, such as public safety, 
parks and libraries. 
</P>
<P>
During a rapid-fire string of votes, the council approved a series of tax and 
fee increases aimed at reducing the shortfall. But, when the string of new 
revenue sources ended, the council directed city department heads to trim about 
$10 million from their already-lean budgets. 
</P>
<P>
It was uncertain Thursday night which city services would be trimmed back. But 
City Manager John Lockwood told council members that the cuts "will have a 
negative impact." 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department, for example, will have to cut about $3 million from its 
$145-million budget, but Lockwood was unsure exactly what services would 
suffer. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the city attorney's office will have to cut an unspecified amount 
from its $16-million budget, but it was uncertain Thursday which programs would 
be cut. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what will be missing," Councilman Ron Roberts complained just 
seconds before the council voted to approve the $470-million general fund 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to increased taxes and fees and the citywide budget cuts, the 
council also trimmed millions from the shortfall by delaying capital 
improvement projects slated for Balboa Park and Mission Bay. The council also 
agreed to eliminate $4 million needed to buy land for a police substation in 
District 4. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the fees and taxes approved Thursday will raise the cost of doing 
business in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the council voted 5 to 4 to increase the business license fee from 
$30 to $125, which would raise $3.2 million in new revenue. Council members 
Abbe Wolfsheimer, Wes Pratt, Linda Bernhardt, Filner and Mayor Maureen O'Connor 
voted for the increased fee. Council members Ron Roberts, John Hartley, Bruce 
Henderson and Judy McCarty voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
The council also increased the current $4-per-employee business fee to $5, 
creating $875,000 in new revenue. 
</P>
<P>
In another business-related tax, the council increased the rental unit fee paid 
by residential landlords. The charge is now $30 per business plus $2 per unit 
for landlords who own six or more units. The new fee, which will apply to 
owners of one or more rental units, will raise $2.3 million through a $40 flat 
rate and a $3-a-unit fee. 
</P>
<P>
The council also approved a $2-million hike in fees for various city services. 
</P>
<P>
The council further voted to use a minimum of $4.8 million from the Water 
Utilities Department to pay for the city's ongoing legal fight to keep Southern 
California Edison from taking over San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. The council 
had been funding the legal battle solely through the general fund. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists and San Diegans who go out for a night on the town will also see 
increased costs because of the council votes. 
</P>
<P>
By a unanimous vote, the council approved a 3% rental car fee that will raise 
an estimated $3 million. The tax is similar to one that the city eliminated in 
the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
The council also approved a tax that would be levied on what Lockwood described 
as "special events . . . at which police primarily . . . but also other 
divisions . . . would be required to support the event." The new fee would 
raise an estimated $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
Council members directed the city manager to study whether the city can levy a 
tax on the San Diego Sports Arena for police and other services provided during 
rock concerts and other events. They also agreed to study an entertainment tax 
that would levy a fee on motion picture tickets. 
</P>
<P>
The council narrowly defeated a proposal to raise $11.2 million through a 2% 
utility user tax against business, commercial and residential customers of gas, 
electric, telephone and cable companies. 
</P>
<P>
City staff members at Thursday's meeting advised council members that it will 
take weeks to determine exactly how much money the tax and fee increases will 
generate. In addition, City Atty. John Witt advised the council that his office 
must first determine if all of the new and increased fees and taxes are legal. 
</P>
<P>
The most heated arguments came when the council debated whether to reverse 
field and fund the four agencies that attempt to draw tourists and businesses 
to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The council froze funding at current levels for the San Diego Convention &amp; 
Visitors Bureau, the San Diego Economic Development Corp., the San Diego Motion 
Picture and Television Bureau and the Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce's 
Economic Research Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Filner, who voted against the funding, told officials of the four organizations 
that the council's vote signaled the need for "greater accountability. . . . 
It's a shaky vote." Bernhardt, who switched her vote and agreed to fund the 
organizations, urged the organizations to add women and minorities to their 
boards of directors. 
</P>
<P>
ConVis, which will receive $6.4 million instead of the $5 million that council 
agreed to provide earlier in the month, "won't have to resort to all of the 
dire activities that we were afraid we would have to do," ConVis executive Dal 
Watkins said Thursday. The vote "shows that tourism does have an awful lot of 
support in this city," Watkins said. 
</P>
<P>
Watkins applauded Councilman Hartley for fashioning the compromise funding 
package that was approved by a 6-3 vote. Hartley's proposal, which was 
incorporated in a lengthy motion, calls for the various organizations to reduce 
their city funding requests by 50% during the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
EDC President Dan Pegg said his organization is "open to an audit" by the city 
if that would eliminate council's concerns. "We have no problem with greater 
accountability," said Pegg, who added that his organization would be able to 
maintain its programs, given the $456,750 in funding approved by the council. 
</P>
<P>
The council also agreed to provide $362,250 for the San Diego Motion Picture 
and Television Bureau and $52,500 for the chamber's Economic Research Bureau.

SAILOR, 22, DIES AFTER BEING HURT IN PACIFIC

<P>
A 22-year-old Simi Valley man who was among 16 sailors injured in two 
explosions aboard a U. S. aircraft carrier in the Pacific last week has died, 
officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Shane Kilgore died about 11 p.m. Wednesday at the Brooke Army Medical 
Center in San Antonio, where he was undergoing treatment for burns over 85% of 
his body, said Capt. James English, a hospital spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Kilgore was a firefighter in the U. S. Navy who aspired to be a Ventura County 
firefighter, said Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley). 
</P>
<P>
Gallegly helped several members of Kilgore's family secure free transportation 
on commercial airlines, and the sailor's relatives were by his side when he 
died, English said. He said he did not know the specific cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
Kilgore was injured during two explosions on July 20 aboard the aircraft 
carrier Midway, which had been performing flight exercises 125 miles off the 
coast of Yokosuka, Japan. Two other sailors died in the explosion. Kilgore and 
seven other injured sailors were flown to the military hospital in San Antonio 
on Friday. The other eight injured sailors are being treated at hospitals in 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Memorial services are pending. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Mayor Gregory Stratton extended his sympathies to Kilgore's family 
in a statement he read during a City Council meeting Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
"Wholesome, energetic and outstanding are some of the words that have been used 
to describe Robert Shane Kilgore throughout his life," Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, 'hero' has been added to the list of adjectives that describe this 
spirited and courageous young man." 
</P>
<P>
The council adjourned its meeting early in Kilgore's honor. CARLOS LOZANO

<P>
AMBULANCE SERVICE TO BE BALLOT ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Moorpark City Council has agreed to ask voters whether taxes should be 
raised to establish a municipal ambulance service. 
</P>
<P>
Council members voted 4 to 1 earlier this week to approve the idea of using a 
special tax to finance a proposed ambulance service for Moorpark residents. 
They plan to take the proposal to a vote in November. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark City Atty. Cheryl Kane said a municipal ambulance service would cost 
about $700,000 to establish, $200,000 more than the estimate provided last week 
by Councilman Clint Harper. 
</P>
<P>
If the measure is approved by voters, it would be the first time that taxpayers 
in Ventura County paid directly for ambulance service. Ambulance service for 
the 10 cities and unincorporated areas of Ventura County is managed by the 
county Emergency Medical Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Larry Dodd, medical director of the county agency, said Thursday that he 
had not been notified by Moorpark officials but planned to look into the 
measure they plan to put before voters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an idea, but it needs a lot of development . . . regarding its 
feasibility," Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
The council for months has sought ways to improve ambulance service for 
Moorpark residents after some residents complained that emergency crews took up 
to half an hour to respond to accident calls. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members contend that the private company contracted by the county 
to provide ambulance service is too slow because the station it dispatches from 
is located about two miles outside Moorpark on Olsen Road. They want to open an 
ambulance station inside the city boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
The company agreed last week at the request of the council to reduce its 
15-minute response time by five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bernardo Perez said a favorable vote on the measure next fall would 
provide the means for paying for a new station. But city officials have not 
decided whether it will set up its own station, manned by its own emergency 
crews, or allow the county to establish one, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Paul Lawrason, who opposed the decision, said creation of an 
independent tax authority to raise money for ambulance services could expose 
Moorpark to legal action from the county or from Pruner Ambulance Co. of 
Thousand Oaks, the only ambulance operator in the eastern part of Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrason said that a two-member committee made up of Harper and Councilwoman 
Eloise Brown failed to look at alternatives to raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"We might find there are alternatives that are not nearly as expensive as 
establishing our own system," Lawrason said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council hurriedly scheduled a special session Saturday to adopt a 
resolution calling for a vote. PSYCHE PASCUAL

SUIT ACCUSES ESCONDIDO POLICE OF PLANTING DRUGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Escondido architect convicted of a drug charge and his wife have sued 
Escondido police, alleging that they planted drugs on him and conducted an 
illegal search of their home. 
</P>
<P>
John and Pamela Aldridge, whose allegations of police wrongdoing sparked 
investigations by the FBI and the district attorney, filed separate but 
identical lawsuits Wednesday. The amount of damages was not specified. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Chief Mike Stein said it would be "inappropriate" to comment on the 
lawsuits. Stein is not named as a defendant, but Chief Vincent Jimno and 
several Escondido officers are. 
</P>
<P>
The Aldridges are seeking money for emotional distress and other damages 
allegedly suffered during a police search of their home and business June 28, 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Nine months after the searches, Vista Municipal Court Judge Victor E. Ramirez 
overturned the search warrant for the residence. The lawsuits quote Ramirez 
accusing Detective Barry Sweeney, who signed the search warrant affidavit, of 
lying in his declaration. 
</P>
<P>
"This affidavit, the import of it, the statements contained within it, the 
scope of the warrant that was issued as a result of it are absolutely prepared 
with reckless disregard for the truth," Ramirez said. "I can't say it to you in 
stronger words than I have said here, that it's just totally shocking to me." 
</P>
<P>
In a May interview with The Times, Sweeney dismissed Ramirez's lecture as "a 
favor" that the judge was doing for attorney Jose Tafolla, who was representing 
John Aldridge. He denied doing anything wrong in preparing the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez ruled that a police search of his office was legal, and that John 
Aldridge was convicted on a misdemeanor charge of possessing methamphetamine. 
He was sentenced to 90 days in County Jail, but is free while appealing the 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits by the Aldridges alleged that Detective David Sparks planted 
methamphetamine in John Aldridge's jeans following an unsuccessful search of 
his office for drugs. The lawsuit alleges that Aldridge had already been 
searched by two other officers, who did not find any drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Aldridge was arrested about three months after the couple accused Sparks' 
sister, Sherry Sparks Crane, of stealing the couple's Master Card, according to 
the lawsuit. About $2,500 in illegal charges were rung up on the card, the 
Aldridges said. 
</P>
<P>
About 16 months after the theft, Escondido police said they have made no 
arrests. On Thursday, Stein said that Crane is not a suspect in the case. Crane 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Aldridges said they and the bank that issued the card have been asked by 
police on five occasions to provide them with the same packet of photocopied 
receipts. Stein said he had "no idea" why police have requested so many copies 
of the same receipts. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuits allege that Crane's boyfriend called Pamela Aldridge on April 27, 
1989, and said that Crane's brother "would get even" with the couple.

INQUIRY PLANNED IN VOTE ON OFFICE SPACE

<P>
The Ventura County district attorney's office plans to question Thousand Oaks 
officials next week to determine whether the City Council broke the law when it 
voted, without public notice, to provide office space for county 
Supervisor-elect Maria VanderKolk. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. 
</P>
<P>
Matthew J. Hardy said Thursday that his office will also view a videotape of 
Tuesday's meeting to determine whether the council violated the state's open 
meeting law. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy said the district attorney's office agreed to look into the matter when 
Greg Cole, a Thousand Oaks resident, called Wednesday to complain. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 11 p.m. Tuesday, the council voted 4 to 1 to declare an 
emergency, allowing it to bypass public notice requirements, then voted to give 
VanderKolk space at the old city library until she takes office in January. 
</P>
<P>
According to city officials, VanderKolk needs the space immediately and there 
was not time to place the matter on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
But Hardy was skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"This is definitely not an emergency. What's happening in Santa Barbara right 
now is an emergency," Hardy said, referring to the disastrous brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks City Atty. Mark G. Sellers defended the council's decision, but 
said he will place the issue on the council's July 10 agenda so residents can 
be heard and the council can vote again. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, VanderKolk will not use the space. 
</P>
<P>
"I welcome public input," VanderKolk said Thursday in a prepared statement 
urging the council to put the matter on its agenda. 
</P>
<P>
She said the plan will not cost the city any money. TINA DAUNT

Ventura County's chief deputy public defender, who was one of the state's 
highest ranking women in public law, died Thursday of ovarian cancer after 
battling the disease for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Yoshioka, 42, who was appointed to her position in August, 1984, 
supervised an office of 57 people along with Public Defender Kenneth I. 
Clayman. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, she was the highest ranking woman in any public defender's office 
in the state. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1986, Mrs. Yoshioka received the Salute to Women Award, which is 
given by the Ventura County Commission on Women to honor women in law 
enforcement. She was active in bar association activities both locally and 
statewide. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Monterey Park, Mrs. Yoshioka had a law degree from UCLA. She passed 
the California State Bar exam in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Yoshioka played the flute and had taken flying lessons. She is survived by 
her husband, Seiji, her parents, Ann and Howard Ogawa of Monterey Park; and a 
sister, Susan Ogawa-Taylor, of Santa Monica. 
</P>

VOTE DELAYED ON REMOVING BIKE LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Camarillo City Council postponed a decision Wednesday on whether to remove 
new bike lanes from Temple Avenue and to allow cars to park there instead. 
</P>
<P>
The lanes, installed three months ago at a cost of $6,000, became a problem 
after soccer and softball players at a nearby park complained of insufficient 
parking, city officials said. Parents dropping off or picking up students at a 
nearby school also used the street for parking, officials of the Pleasant 
Valley School District told the city. 
</P>
<P>
Because parking is prohibited in designated bicycle lanes, city staff members 
and the council's Transportation Committee have recommended that the lanes be 
replaced with signs designating Temple Avenue as a bicycle route instead of a 
bicycle lane. 
</P>
<P>
Bike routes have no striped right of way, and parking is permitted. The only 
thing that distinguishes a bike route from a regular street is a sign 
designating the street as a preferred bikeway, a condition Mayor Charlotte 
Craven said is insufficient for well-traveled Temple Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Greeley, the city's director of engineering, said bicycle lanes offer 
more protection to cyclists than bike routes, but bike routes still protect 
riders because the signs act as cautions to motorists. 
</P>
<P>
"It increases the motorists' awareness and cautiousness," Greeley said. 
</P>
<P>
Temple Avenue is the latest link in the city's ambitious plan to establish a 
citywide system of bicycle lanes and routes over the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
The council split 2 to 2 on the proposal to downgrade the bicycle lanes. In a 
compromise, Councilman Mike Morgan, an avid ball player, suggested that the 
council narrow the two northbound lanes of Temple Avenue to one to allow for 
both parking and bicycle lanes. Craven and Councilman David Smith refused to 
vote for any parking along Temple. 
</P>
<P>
The council will reconsider a proposal to alter the bicycle lanes Sept. 12.

SCHOOL ANTI-DRUG PROGRAM TO EXPAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN McKEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An anti-drug education program in Ventura elementary schools will be expanded 
this fall to include the city's four middle schools, Ventura police officials 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department, which coordinates the Drug Abuse Resistance Education 
(DARE) program for the Ventura Unified School District, is working this summer 
on a curriculum that will be presented to seventh-graders during the upcoming 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
The department supplies three specially trained officers for the DARE programs 
at elementary schools and will assign one more officer for the seventh-grade 
program. The new program also will have a new name: Middle School DARE/GIARY, 
which stands for Gang Involved At Risk Youth. 
</P>
<P>
Although the program will educate the youngsters on the dangers of drug and 
gang involvement, it also will deal with other problems facing the district's 
nearly 1,100 seventh-graders, said Ric Nargie, director of pupil services for 
the school district. 
</P>
<P>
The California Office of Criminal Justice has provided a $50,000 grant, the 
bulk of the needed start-up money for the new program. The Police Department is 
contributing $16,600 and the Downtown Ventura Lions Club has donated $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to hire a new police officer to replace the veteran 
officer chosen to work full time presenting DARE/GIARY classes at Anacapa, 
Balboa, Cabrillo and De Anza middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
The middle school program will continue the message offered in lower grades. 
About 1,800 fifth-graders participate in DARE, and then go through the 
sixth-grade QUEST program, which teaches life skills for adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
"The elementary school is just the place to begin, not the place to stop," said 
Police Chief Richard Thomas. "The three programs will be kind of like a 
washing-machine cycle for the students. Each grade that passes through will be 
cleansed even more." 
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the new program will provide seventh-graders with help in 
making choices, Nargie said. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll give them accurate information about the sort of dangerous effects of 
substance abuse," he said. "It gives them some coping mechanisms to deal with 
peer pressure, and through the program they can build some of their self-esteem 
so that they know that they're an OK person and don't have to use drugs to deal 
with their problems." KAREN McKEAN

ARCHEOLOGIST DENIES WORKING FOR BUILDER;

<P>
'LOST VILLAGE': BRIAN D. DILLON SAYS HE WAS NEVER RETAINED AS A CONSULTANT ON 
THE ENCINO PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A prominent archeologist, angry that his name was used in a developer's behalf 
at a city hearing, has denied that he was hired as a consultant on a Ventura 
Boulevard construction project near the site of the "Lost Village of Encino." 
</P>
<P>
Builder Maurice Cohen's reported employment of Brian D. Dillon was an important 
issue at a June 19 hearing by the city Building and Safety Commission. The 
hearing was held at the request of neighborhood activists and American Indians 
to determine whether Cohen could begin construction of an office building 
without a preliminary survey to protect potential archeological finds. 
</P>
<P>
The building site is on the north side of Ventura Boulevard at La Maida Street, 
about a block from where the "Lost Village" was unearthed during another 
construction project six years ago. The unearthing marked a major discovery of 
Indian artifacts and remains. 
</P>
<P>
Archeologists say it is probable that additional remains of the village 
underlie much of the surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, which could have required Cohen to perform an archeological 
survey before receiving a building permit, voted to allow Cohen to begin 
construction if an archeologist and Indian representative monitored the project 
during earth-moving for discovery of artifacts and human remains. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether Cohen deliberately misled the commission into believing he 
had already hired Dillon as the archeologist. 
</P>
<P>
Dillon, a former chief archeologist at UCLA, said Cohen did not retain him, as 
neighborhood activists and Building and Safety Commission members said they 
were led to believe. Instead, Dillon said, negotiations with Cohen broke down 
after the builder rejected standard conditions and procedures outlined in a 
proposal for studying his property for the presence of American Indian 
artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
"He had no right to use my name at a public meeting," said Dillon, adding that 
he had demanded a written apology from Cohen because he felt that his 
credentials had been exploited. "If someone besmirches your reputation then you 
have to take that seriously," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he believed that he and Dillon did have an understanding to work 
together, although he had delayed signing a contract until the commission heard 
his case. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not lie to the commission," said Cohen, 28, a member of a family 
business that wants to build a 48,000-square-foot office building. "I was under 
the impression myself that I had a proposal from Mr. Dillon, and that after the 
final decision of the Building and Safety Commission I was going to sit with 
him and based on their decision agree with him to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I've left several messages for him, and he has not called me back." 
</P>
<P>
But Dillon said he and Cohen met for more than four hours the night before the 
hearing, and that Cohen "could not have been more direct that we did not have 
an understanding, contract or agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Dillon said that because Cohen's property lies within an archeologically 
sensitive area, he had proposed sampling the site for artifacts before 
construction. But Cohen, he said, objected to that method because it required a 
substantial advance payment to cover the cost of hiring a work crew with 
liability insurance. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen wanted to use Dillon as a monitor, Dillon said, because he could pay at 
the end of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he rejected Dillon's proposal because he wanted to wait for the 
commission's instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Richard W. Hartzler and commission President Marcia Marcus said 
that although they could not remember Cohen's precise words, they were left 
with the impression that he already had a working arrangement with Dillon, if 
not a written contract. The commission does not record its proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
They said Cohen's apparent sincerity coupled with Dillon's reputation was a 
factor in their decision to allow Cohen to begin construction with monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the fact that they were going with a highly respected archeologist 
certainly had a bearing on the outcome of the hearing," Hartzler said. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus said she would raise Dillon's allegations at the commission's next 
hearing in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious that one of our conditions was ongoing monitoring, and that it 
had to be done by someone who had a known reputation in the archeological 
community," Marcus said. Because Dillon "seemed to be someone of good repute, 
it just appeared that Mr. Cohen was operating in very good faith," Marcus said. 
</P>
<P>
Encino residents Gerald A. Silver and Kathy Lewis, leading proponents of 
stricter archeological safeguards, said they felt misled by Cohen and pledged 
to monitor his building site daily to ensure that no excavation takes place 
without the presence of an archeologist, whether it was Dillon or another 
qualified professional. 
</P>
<P>
Silver, a slow-growth activist who opposes Cohen's project, said: 
</P>
<P>
"I think the point is that if he had gone in and said, 'I haven't hired anyone, 
I haven't done any preliminary work, I just want to start digging,' I think 
they would have put much more rigorous controls on it."

MAN HELD AFTER REPORTING FIRES; WATCHMAN, SON ARRESTED IN BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies arrested three people Thursday in 
connection with four fires in the Antelope Valley, and investigations continued 
in two more blazes that occurred within the same 24-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
There were no injuries in the six fires, five of which were brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies arrested David Wayne Cunningham, 28, at his girlfriend's home in 
Quartz Hill early Thursday in connection with two brush fires in Leona Valley 
and one in Quartz Hill that were set between 12:45 and 2 a.m., sheriff's Sgt. 
Ron Shreves said. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham called authorities to report the first two fires and claimed that he 
had stomped them out, but deputies arrested him because his story was 
inconsistent, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday afternoon, sheriff's investigators arrested a construction site 
security guard and his 16-year-old son in connection with a fire at 55th Street 
West and Avenue N-8 in Palmdale that gutted one house under construction and 
damaged another Wednesday night, causing $70,000 in damage, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Leroy Rife, 33, and his son are suspected of unintentionally causing the 
fire with fireworks that they were setting off while Rife was on duty for 
Developers Security at the Griffin Homes construction site, Shreves said. A 
bottle rocket landed on the roof of a house under construction and ignited it, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rife and his son, both of Rosamond, were arrested on suspicion of recklessly 
causing a fire, a misdemeanor, Shreves said, and were to be released on their 
own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators were also trying to determine the cause of a small brush fire 
about 7:30 a.m. that burned about five acres in Bouquet Canyon and another fire 
that burned five acres in Placerita Canyon near the Antelope Valley Freeway 
about 4 p.m., according to county Fire Capt. Joseph Graham. Both fires were 
described as suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the three brush fires allegedly set by Cunningham started about 
12:45 a.m. in the Spunky Canyon area and burned about five acres before being 
extinguished. The second burned about 10 acres in Leona Valley about 15 minutes 
later and the third burned about half an acre in Quartz Hill near the residence 
of Cunningham's girlfriend at Avenue L and 42nd Street West, Shreves said. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, who told deputies that he is self-employed and lives in Castaic, 
called state Department of Forestry firefighters to report the first and second 
fires, claiming that he had stomped out the flames and spotted a suspicious 
vehicle nearby, Shreves said. 
</P>
<P>
But deputies who interviewed him about 4 a.m. became suspicious because of his 
nervousness, numerous inconsistencies in his story and the proximity of the 
last fire to the house, Shreves said. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the problems was that he happened to take the same path as these fires 
and they were not on a straight line," Shreves said. "They thought it was more 
than coincidence." 
</P>
<P>
Further investigation showed that Cunningham's footprints matched footprints at 
the scene of one of the fires, Shreves said. Cunningham was being held at the 
Antelope Valley sheriff's station on $5,000 bond.

VANDALS DEFACE BARELY DRY MURAL OF ESCONDIDO'S PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vandals defaced a just-completed Escondido mural Wednesday night, marring 
one-quarter of the painting in what backers are calling a racially motivated 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
Two 5-gallon containers of white primer paint were splashed onto the mural, 
which depicts the history of Escondido and had been opposed by some residents 
for what they felt was a Latino overtone that would attract gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that whoever did it intentionally directed the paint toward the 
Native American people depicted in the mural," said Nicole Brown of the 
Felicita Foundation, the sponsoring organization behind the painting. 
</P>
<P>
The mural, completed Wednesday by local high school students and noted San 
Diego muralists Salvador and Gloria Torres, had been in the works since April. 
It cost $8,400 and took more than 1,300 hours of volunteer work to construct. 
</P>
<P>
The mural decorates three walls of the North Inland Neighborhood Recovery 
Center, a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center on Ash Street. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the incident, the dedication of the mural went on as planned Thursday 
night, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"I see it as a racially motivated act, by people who view the mural as a 
statement that's purely Hispanic-oriented, which the mural is not," said 
Barbara Waters, director of the Felicita Foundation. "It's community oriented 
and shows cultural diversity." 
</P>
<P>
The mural depicts aspects of the history of Escondido and includes 
representations of American Indians, African-Americans, Asian-Americans, 
Latinos and Anglos. 
</P>
<P>
The mural also shows landscapes, scenes from the Wild Animal Park, and 
technological advances as well as two hands, one light-skinned and one 
dark-skinned, clasped together. 
</P>
<P>
"The neighbors didn't like it being there," said Aaron Bouchard, a junior in 
high school who worked on the project from its inception. "They figured that it 
would bring a bad element to the neighborhood just because it had basically a 
Hispanic base." 
</P>
<P>
Salvador Torres, who was one of the original painters of the well-known 
muralists in San Diego's Chicano Park and who has been active in community 
mural painting for more than two decades, said the newness of public art to 
Escondido led to misunderstandings by some residents and brought expected 
criticism of the mural. 
</P>
<P>
"All of this is part of Escondido's development, and of course the native 
population is one of the most important of all, and that's why in the center of 
the ethnic group figure is the Native American," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said it will take at least 50 hours and $1,000 to restore the mural.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST : SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 32-year-old East San Diego man shot himself in the head at his residence 
after fleeing a minor hit-run accident, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 11 p.m. Wednesday, Paul Michael Burke hit another car at College 
Avenue and Meridian Avenue, police spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
After the accident, a witness followed Burke to his residence, a converted 
garage in the 5700 block of Redwood Street, officials said. The witness 
notified a police officer who was impounding a car a few houses away. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the officer approached the house and heard a single gunshot. More 
officers were called to the residence, surrounded it, and attempted to contact 
Burke by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Officers entered the residence after midnight, Robinson said, and found Burke 
dead of a self-inflicted shotgun blast to the head.

<P>
A Burbank toddler hospitalized after falling into his father's back-yard 
swimming pool died of cardiac arrest as a result of drowning, police said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Smith, 2 1/2, died just after 1 p.m. Wednesday at UCLA Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
He had been on a life-support system since early Wednesday, when he was 
transferred to UCLA from St. Joseph Medical Center, Burbank Police Sgt. Don 
Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander was staying at his father's house in the 800 block of Bethany Road. 
He was last seen in the house about 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, when his father and 
15-year-old brother went outside to play basketball, Goldberg said. The brother 
found Alexander lying face down in the pool about 10 p.m., Goldberg said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ABORTION RIGHTS GROUP ENDORSES DEMOCRAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Abortion Rights Action League has endorsed Democrat Irene Allert 
in her bid to win the northern San Fernando Valley Assembly seat being vacated 
by Marian W. La Follette (R-Northridge). 
</P>
<P>
Allert will face Republican real estate broker Paula Boland, who opposes 
abortion rights, in the November general election. 
</P>
<P>
CARAL Executive Director Robin Schneider said Wednesday that her group, which 
has 100,000 members, has endorsed Allert but has not yet "decided the level of 
support" it will provide. The group typically contributes money and volunteer 
campaigners to candidates it backs. 
</P>
<P>
Allert said abortion, growth and education will be the major issues in the 
campaign for the 38th Assembly District seat, which covers the Valley from 
Hidden Hills to Tujunga. La Follette is retiring after 10 years in the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Asked her reaction to the CARAL endorsement, Boland said: "So what? It doesn't 
mean anything to me." 
</P>
<P>
She said such issues as crime and breaking up the Los Angeles Unified School 
District are more important to voters than abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
"If she wants to run on one issue, that's her choice," Boland said. "But there 
are many important issues. I've never been a one-issue candidate and I'm not 
going to be one now."

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $30-MILLION BOND FOR SCHOOLS PUT ON BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A bond issue to raise up to $30 million to upgrade and expand schools in the 
Sulphur Springs School District has been placed on the Nov. 6 ballot by 
district trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night, trustees endorsed a bond proposal that would expand existing 
schools to cope with skyrocketing enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
The district, which serves 3,200 students in Canyon Country, is the first 
school district in the Santa Clarita Valley to put a bond measure before the 
voters this year. Officials from four other school systems in the area are 
considering similar measures. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which needs two-thirds approval for passage, would not raise 
existing property tax rates, district Supt. Robert Nolet said. Instead, it 
would merely extend by 25 years a series of earlier district bond measures set 
to expire within five years. 
</P>
<P>
Nolet compared the effect of the measure to taking out a second mortgage on a 
home. The amount of the monthly payments will not rise, but the payments will 
be spread out over a longer period of time, he said.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BERNSON POSTPONES KEY PORTER RANCH HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles city officials announced Thursday that a key City Council hearing 
on the proposed 1,300-acre Porter Ranch project has been postponed until July 
10. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the Porter Ranch area, wanted the delay 
to "give his constituents more time to review the latest plan," said Ali Saar, 
the lawmaker's press deputy. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing had been set for July 3. With the postponement, the Fourth of July 
holiday "won't be an obstacle," Saar said. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the project had hotly complained that Bernson's original decision 
to set the hearing date for July 3 would make it difficult for many of their 
supporters to attend because they would be away on long holiday breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Paul Clarke, press deputy for the Porter Ranch Development Co., the 
partnership that plans to develop the project, said the hearing was delayed 
because the city attorney's office was unable to finish its review of the 
complicated package of actions the council will be asked to approve. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles City Council panel voted 5 to 0 last week to support the Porter 
Ranch project, which calls for construction of up to 6 million square feet of 
commercial-office space and 3,395 homes in the Chatsworth hills north of the 
Simi Valley Freeway.

FARM WORKERS' PROTEST TARGETS VONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 200 United Farm Workers and their supporters protested in front of a Vons 
supermarket in Burbank Thursday, launching the start of what organizers said 
was a major offensive against the store for breaking an agreement not to 
advertise grapes grown with pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
"We tell all the citizens of this great country, of this great county and city 
not to shop at Vons until Vons agrees to stop advertising, promoting and 
selling the contaminated, poisoned grapes," UFW President Cesar Chavez told a 
clapping, cheering crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying signs that read, "No Grapes, No Malathion," and "Don't Shop Here," 
protesters marched from McCambridge Park in Burbank to a Vons market on San 
Fernando Road. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really the only alternative we have," protester Tom Dillon said of the 
demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
The Vons grocery chain, the largest seller of table grapes in Southern 
California, agreed in 1989 not to advertise the grapes, which are grown near 
Coachella in Riverside County, said David Martinez, UFW secretary and 
treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
But Chavez said the chain broke that agreement three weeks later and began 
selling them at extremely low prices. The UFW is promoting a boycott of table 
grapes grown using pesticides because they believe the chemicals cause cancer 
in farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
"Vons speaks through both sides of its corporate mouth," Chavez said, after 
holding up a newspaper advertisement promoting grapes. 
</P>
<P>
Vons spokeswoman Vickie Sanders said the store offers its customers a choice. 
"We have tested the grapes and there have been no detected residues of 
pesticides," she added. Sanders declined to comment further.

BERMAN RANKS 10TH IN FUNDS FROM AILING S &amp; L INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) received $45,950 in campaign 
contributions from the scandal-plagued savings and loan industry in the 1980s, 
the 10th-highest amount among present House members, according to a Common 
Cause study released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Among other San Fernando Valley area representatives, Elton Gallegly (R-Simi 
Valley), who was first elected in 1986, received $20,050, and Carlos J. 
Moorhead (R-Glendale) received $14,635, the citizens lobby reported. Rep. 
William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield), whose district reaches into the Antelope 
Valley, received $11,800 since 1980, Common Cause said. 
</P>
<P>
Common Cause said the funds helped influence legislation that eased regulation 
of savings and loans. The industry cleanup approved by Congress will cost more 
than $300 billion; the FBI is investigating 530 failed institutions for 
possible criminal violations. 
</P>
<P>
"S &amp; L interests provided millions of dollars in campaign contributions to 
members of Congress throughout the 1980s," Common Cause President Fred 
Wertheimer said. "This contributed to the worst financial scandal in American 
history." 
</P>
<P>
No Valley area representative has been directly associated with the scandal. 
None sit on the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee. And Berman 
and Gallegly arrived in Congress after it passed the most important legislation 
deregulating the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the largest and most politically active S &amp; Ls, including the 
failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn., were based in California. Lincoln gave 
$461,800 in contributions, Common Cause said. Six of the 10 biggest givers were 
California institutions; the top six House recipients were Californians. 
</P>
<P>
The area lawmakers' totals were relatively modest compared to the sums given to 
former Democratic leaders tarnished by the scandal. Former Speaker Jim Wright 
of Texas received $131,430; former House Banking chairman Fernand St. Germain 
of Rhode Island received $144,400 from 1981 to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known some of these people for a very long time and some of them 
generally support things I'm doing here that had nothing to do with the S &amp; 
L industry," Berman said of his contributors. "I certainly solicited 
contributions, and they must have responded." 
</P>
<P>
Berman said he opposed the industry by supporting the 1987 bailout proposal. 
The Reagan Administration called for $15 billion in new borrowing authority for 
the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. to bail out failing S &amp; Ls. 
</P>
<P>
The industry, which would have been required to pay interest on the borrowed 
funds, succeeded in lowering the bailout amount to $5 million on the House 
floor. The final figure was $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and four others are under investigation by the 
Senate Ethics Committee for intervening with federal regulators on behalf of 
Lincoln. Berman said he has never been asked to go to bat for any S &amp; L.

Hey, good news in Thursday morning's Rome newspapers: Not a single mention 
about anybody in Italy being interested in Bo Kimble. 
</P>
<P>
The big story -- after several pages of soccer, of course -- in Il Messaggero 
Roma was headlined: "Torno a Roma" -- "I'm Returning to Rome." 
</P>
<P>
The athlete being quoted, though, was neither Kimble, who was drafted Wednesday 
by the Clippers and once expressed interest in playing basketball in Italy, nor 
Danny Ferry, who was drafted in 1989 by the Clippers and did play in Italy, for 
a team sponsored by Il Messaggero. No, the speaker was Brian Shaw, the former 
NBA first-round draft choice from UC Santa Barbara who keeps trying not to play 
for the Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
Shaw insisted again Wednesday that he was returning to Rome for another season, 
even though a federal judge in Boston upheld the validity of a five-year, 
$6.2-million contract Shaw has with the Celtics, binding him to the NBA club 
through 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Carlo Sama, the president of Il Messaggero Roma who was in New York for the NBA 
draft, said Brian and his father, Charles Shaw, reassured him after the judge's 
verdict that, one way or another, by Aug. 4 Brian would report with his 
teammates to the team in Rome. "We sealed with a hug our longstanding 
relationship," Sama said. 
</P>
<P>
If there were any other American players Sama wanted, including those drafted 
Wednesday, he didn't say. Or if he did, it got buried in the soccer news. With 
all this soccer, they hardly have room to squeeze in Tank McNamara over here. 
</P>
<P>
World Cup journal, Week 3 continues: 
</P>
<P>
With a big game on TV, Rachan Pinthong hurried up and put his crocodiles to bed 
for the night. Then he rushed back to his farmhouse in Buri Ram, Thailand, to 
watch the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Well, just as some Thai version of Brent Musburger was in the process of 
yelling, "You are looking live!" several thieves slipped unnoticed onto 
Pinthong's property. Yes, it was those diabolical crocodile rustlers every 
Thailand farmer fears. 
</P>
<P>
They drugged the crocs with a pesticide, bundled them up and made off with the 
lot. Pinthong rose the next morning to discover that the beasts he had been 
breeding were gone. 
</P>
<P>
And some unlucky Thailand tourist next week will have to do without a really 
nice matching purse and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Then there were the TV viewers in Calcutta who were just getting into another 
exciting match when the electricity went out, interrupting the telecast. 
</P>
<P>
This happens in the United States all the time, but the reaction is usually not 
quite so severe. Hundreds of angry Indian fans went right out, discovered the 
whereabouts of a number of officials from the power department . . . and beat 
them up. 
</P>
<P>
They literally dragged these officials out of their offices, spat on them and 
pounded them with their fists, which is something they generally frown upon at 
Southern California Edison. Mamta Banerjee, meanwhile, had an even better idea. 
A member of a political party that opposes the Marxist state government, 
Banerjee declared: "The government has failed totally! They cannot provide us 
with security, law and order, water! Now, even the World Cup has been denied 
us! 
</P>
<P>
"They should resign immediately!" 
</P>
<P>
Read and heed, George Bush. Raising taxes is one thing, but next time something 
serious such as our Super Bowl coverage gets interrupted, we may be coming 
after you. 
</P>
<P>
The award for Best Hair of the World Cup is still up for grabs, but certainly 
the early leaders remain: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Carlos Valderrama, Colombia. Sort of a Harpo Marx meets Andre Agassi 
hairdo, bushy and red, making Valderrama resemble something on the order of a 
small, lovely, shady tree. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ruud Gullit, the Netherlands. Dreadlocks any Dutch reggae singer would 
envy. Pippi Longstocking didn't have pigtails this long. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Salvatore Schillaci, Italy. A hero not only to his people for his 
goal-scoring, but to those of us who over the years have come to appreciate the 
Terry Bradshaw/Kareem Abdul-Jabbar/Kirk Gibson receding-scalp look. Thanks, 
Sal. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of good hair, we sure are sorry to see El Loco go. 
</P>
<P>
Rene Higuita was as colorful a player as there was in the tournament. He was 
Colombia's goalkeeper, the one with the flowing hair that went flying and 
flopping whenever and wherever Higuita went flying and flopping. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody back in Bogota referred to the goalkeeper as El Loco because, instead 
of playing it safe, Walk-Away Rene would stray far from his box, sometimes 20 
and 30 yards toward midfield, to chase down loose balls. He made Kelly Hrudey 
of the Kings look like a stay-at-home. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, El Loco went too far. With a game against Cameroon on the line, and 
Colombia's chances of advancing to the Cup quarterfinals for the first time 
along with it, Higuita took it upon himself in the 106th minute of play to 
wander far from goal. How far? Let's just say an usher asked to see his ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Roger Milla of Cameroon came along and stole the ball from him, which 
made El Loco's hair stand on end, obstructing the view of thousands of 
spectators. Milla scored, Colombia lost, and Higuita called his mistake "as big 
as a house." He did not specify ranch, Spanish colonial or split-level. 
</P>
<P>
Many Colombians said they would forgive El Loco his mistake. Even so, 
embarrassing moments such as these are why so many goalies wear masks. 
</P>
<P>
Best Dance After a Winning Goal in the World Cup: Milla, Cameroon, hands down. 
Elmo Wright, Billy (White Shoes) Johnson and Ickey Woods had nothing on this 
guy. 
</P>
<P>
At least the popular Brussels newspaper, La Derniere Heure, took Belgium's 1-0 
defeat by England in stride. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's sports-page headline read: "We Should Shoot Ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
For some reason, we cannot remember this headline appearing in Los Angeles 
papers after the Phoenix series. 
</P>
<P>
The day before the game, when the Belgians were still uncertain whether injured 
defender Georges Grun would be able to play, a headline in the International 
Herald Tribune read: "Belgium Waits Word on Hurt Grun." 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, man, we know. Grun injuries are the worst.

PUGH, BOMB SCARE NO MATCH FOR CHANG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
His reign as king of clay officially ended, Michael Chang stepped on the fabled 
grass courts of Wimbledon and strolled briskly into the third round. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing was going to stop him either. Not Jim Pugh, not slick grass and not 
even a bomb scare. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, who saw the French Open trophy he won last June handed to Andres Gomez 
three weeks ago, dispensed with Pugh in 1 hour 33 minutes Thursday, 6-3, 6-2, 
6-2, shortly after play was halted for 15 minutes when a suspicious package was 
found on the grounds of the All England Club. 
</P>
<P>
Gates were closed, play was halted on three courts, and police inspected the 
package, which turned out to be a camera case. David Pate of Las Vegas was 
preparing to serve out his match against Gilbert Raoux of France when play was 
stopped on Court 4. 
</P>
<P>
Pate was reluctant to stop but was persuaded to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to finish," he said. "Besides, it was on the other side of the court 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Playing on Court 3, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and partner Mercedes Paz were 
halted at match point in their doubles match. Sanchez Vicario quickly packed 
her bags, pausing only briefly on her way out to explain to the crowd: "It is a 
bomb, it is a bomb." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it was not. The last real bomb found at Wimbledon was dropped on it 
in 1940, destroying 1,200 Centre Court seats. 
</P>
<P>
Chang was in the locker room watching televised coverage of the suspicious 
package. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guy suddenly picks it up and starts walking away," he said. "We all 
laughed and said 'What a great job to be able to defuse bombs.' " 
</P>
<P>
On the courts, there were no scares. Top-seeded Ivan Lendl's 6-1, 6-3, 6-0 
second-round victory over Jakob Hlasek of Switzerland was not interrupted by 
the bomb scare. Afterward, Lendl said his quest for a Wimbledon title will not 
be interrupted by anything so maudlin as being labeled a sentimental favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"I would rather be the villain with five titles under my belt," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sweden's Stefan Edberg, with one Wimbledon title under his belt, continued on 
the right track for another with a 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 victory over Miloslav Mecir of 
Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Martina Navratilova had only one slight misstep in an otherwise routine 6-2, 
6-3 victory over Anne Smith. Navratilova lost her serve trying to close out the 
match the first time, but not the second time. 
</P>
<P>
The only other problem Navratilova had was trying to spot Chris Evert, who was 
sitting in the Royal Box. When Navratilova curtsied to the Royal Box before the 
match, she missed Evert in the third row. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to look a little longer, but that's not a pose you want to hold for 
very long," Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
By the time her match was over, Navratilova had seen Evert. As Navratilova 
curtsied again leaving the court, she stuck out her tongue at Evert. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-seeded Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina found herself stuck in a 
tiebreaker with Anke Huber but pulled out a 6-2, 7-6 (10-8) victory over the 
15-year-old West German. 
</P>
<P>
Ninth-seeded Jim Courier of Plant City, Fla., Jim Grabb of Tucson, Brad Pearce 
of Provo, Utah, and Pate also advanced. 
</P>
<P>
Courier defeated Jason Stoltenberg of Australia, 6-2, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4; Grabb 
defeated 1989 quarterfinalist Paul Chamberlin of Del Mar, 6-2, 6-7 (9-7), 7-6 
(8-6), 3-6, 6-3; Pearce defeated Shuzo Matsuoka of Japan, 7-6 (7-1), 7-5, 6-3, 
and Pate defeated Raoux 3-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Chang's victory put him into a match against Australian Mark Kratzmann, 24, and 
in line for a potential fourth-round showdown against Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
"That would be exciting for me," said Chang, who hasn't played Edberg since 
beating him in last year's French Open final. 
</P>
<P>
The French Open crown rested heavily on Chang's head. After he lost to Andre 
Agassi in this year's quarterfinals, he said he felt as though a weight had 
been lifted off him. And no longer being a defending Grand Slam champion seems 
to agree with Chang. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little easier for me," he said. "After my first match here, I was 
waiting for someone to get me to take me to my postmatch press conference, and 
no one came. 
</P>
<P>
"This is different, so you know, I think it has helped me out a little bit. 
It's given me some time where I can just relax a little bit more and just go 
out and play and not have to worry so much about being labeled as the French 
Open champion." 
</P>
<P>
Pugh isn't sure Chang will be labeled the Wimbledon champion. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, I would have said no, I don't think he could, but if he's passing 
that well -- he doesn't serve that well -- he gives somebody trouble," Pugh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, it's going to be really hard for him without being able to serve and 
volley to win it on grass. But Borg did, and I guess it can be done. It's a 
tough way to do it."

NEWSWIRE: FERRY'S DEAL COULD GROW TO $34 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rookie Danny Ferry's contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers will pay him at 
least $14 million over the next five years, but could ultimately become a 
10-year, $34-million deal, the Akron Beacon Journal reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Ferry, the former Duke star who played professionally in Italy last season, 
signed with the Cavaliers earlier this month. The newspaper said Ferry got a 
$1-million signing bonus and an annual salary beginning at $2 million and 
escalating to $3.3 million in the fifth year. 
</P>
<P>
Either party can get out of the contract at that point under certain 
conditions. If the deal continues, Ferry could get $4 million for each of the 
ensuing five years.

<P>
John McNally, a 1988 Olympian, won the men's standard pistol title Thursday at 
the 30th U.S. International Shooting Championships in Chino. 
</P>
<P>
McNally of Columbus, Ga., had 1146 points, with Terry Anderson of Dallas and 
Jerry Wilder of Remington, Ind., tied for second at 144. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder did not report for the tiebreaking shootoff, so Anderson took second by 
default. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Foth of Colorado Springs, Colo., another 1988 Olympian, won the men's air 
rifle with a score of 1284.9. Mike Anti of Columbus, Ga., was second with 
1269.7, and Bill Dodd of Queenstown, Md., third with 1265. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's matches, Deena Wigger of Colorado Springs, Colo., took titles in 
both rifle events. In the three-position match, she won with a score of 1265.1, 
followed by Launi Meili of Cheney, Wash., at 1256.5, and Kris Peterson of St. 
Paul, Minn., with 1252.6. 
</P>
<P>
In the standard rifle prone competition, Wigger won with a score of 1174. Robin 
McCall of Tryon, N.C., and Lana Ward of Indian Rocks Beach, Fla., tied for 
second with scores of 1173, with McCall taking second in a tiebreaking 
shootoff. 
</P>
<P>
The competition concludes today with the men's international skeet events. 
Also, the roster of U.S. Shooting team for all rifle, pistol, shotgun and 
running target events will be announced.

</P>
<P>
MEN WEARING BLACK ARE BEING CALLED THE BAD GUYS; 
</P>
<P>
REFEREES: FROM THE FIRST GAME OF ITALIA '90, IT WAS MADE CLEAR WHO WOULD BE IN 
CHARGE ON THE FIELD. FIFA'S STAND REMAINS FIRM ON USE OF REPLAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ROME, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The key to this World Cup may well be in the pockets of the men in black. 
</P>
<P>
There, each referee keeps two cards, one yellow and one red. The first is to 
warn a player, the second is to expel him from the game. 
</P>
<P>
So far, through the first 44 matches of the 52-game tournament, both cards have 
been shown with depressing frequency, lending credence to the argument that the 
officials are having more impact on the World Cup than the players. 
</P>
<P>
It began with the opening game in Milan three weeks ago. French referee Michel 
Vautrot, who even before the tournament was being touted as the man most likely 
to referee the World Cup final in Rome on July 8, saw fit to issue four yellow 
cards and two red cards. 
</P>
<P>
Vautrot expelled Cameroon's Andre Kana Biyick in the 62nd minute and Benjamin 
Massing in the 88th, both for fouls on Argentine forward Claudio Caniggia. 
</P>
<P>
Even though it was reduced to nine players, Cameroon managed to score a 
remarkable upset, but Vautrot's seemingly harsh rulings signaled the beginning 
of a familiar pattern. In effect, he set the tone for the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
As of today, with the quarterfinals scheduled to begin Saturday, game officials 
have issued 137 yellow cards and 11 red cards, compared to 112 and six, 
respectively, through the same period in Mexico in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
FIFA, world soccer's governing body, made it plain for several months before 
the tournament that it would not tolerate foul play, and that it expected the 
36 referees selected to officiate in the World Cup to follow its directives. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph (Sepp) Blatter, FIFA's secretary general and a main proponent of the 
organization's "Fair Play Please" campaign, defended Vautrot's decisions in the 
opener, saying that such stiff punishment was necessary to discourage players 
who "want to destroy the game of soccer instead of letting creativity and 
genius flow." He said Vautrot's actions should serve as a warning to other 
players in future games. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm unhappy the referee was forced to intervene like he did," Blatter said. 
"But I'm pleased that he did." 
</P>
<P>
As the opening round progressed, however, coaches, players and reporters became 
increasingly concerned at the inconsistency with which FIFA's mandate was being 
administered. Too, often, it seemed, a foul that earned a player a warning or 
even an ejection in one game was worth no more than a wag of the referee's 
finger in another. 
</P>
<P>
The three dozen officials chosen by FIFA are all experienced referees, but all 
too often they seemed unclear as to just how to apply FIFA's get-tough policy. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Italian referee Tullio Lanese whistled 163 fouls in the three 
games he officiated -- an average of more than 54 a game -- whereas Japanese 
referee Shizuo Takada whistled only 23 in the one match he worked. 
</P>
<P>
Only one week after praising Vautrot's handling of the Cameroon-Argentina 
match, Blatter was bemoaning the inconsistency shown by officials and openly 
criticizing some decisions. 
</P>
<P>
In a widely circulated interview with the Swiss newspaper Berner Zeitung, 
Blatter said he was "disappointed and taken aback" by some "false decisions 
that should never have happened." 
</P>
<P>
These, he said, included "the hand ball outside the penalty area when the 
Soviet Union played Romania, the first red card for Cameroon (against Biyick) 
and the penalty for Egypt against Holland." 
</P>
<P>
In each instance, Blatter said, the referee should have consulted his linesmen 
before making his decision. 
</P>
<P>
"The wrong decisions were avoidable because a referee at this World Cup must 
never judge by himself," Blatter said. "We (FIFA) made sure that the referee 
teams were put together in such a way that there would be no language problems 
between the referee and the linesmen. 
</P>
<P>
"But the mistaken referees acted high-handedly and wrongly." 
</P>
<P>
Included in those incorrect decisions, according to Blatter, was Swiss referee 
Kurt Rothlisberger's sending off of United States midfielder Eric Wynalda in 
the match against Czechoslovakia. Blatter described the call as "clearly too 
harsh" and said "a yellow card would have been sufficient." 
</P>
<P>
FIFA's policy of severe action against fouling is both necessary and long 
overdue, and West German Coach Franz Beckenbauer has also called for action 
against the time-wasting tactics employed by lesser teams seeking a tie right 
from the kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
But Beckenbauer was quick to file an appeal after midfielder Rudi Voeller was 
red-carded and Lothar Matthaeus yellow-carded in West Germany's victory over 
the Netherlands last Sunday. The referee in that game, Argentina's Juan 
Loustau, also expelled the Netherlands' Frank Rijkaard. 
</P>
<P>
"In our opinion, they were two crass and wrong decisions," a West German team 
spokesman said in lodging the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer said the uneven officiating threatens to turn the World Cup into a 
circus. 
</P>
<P>
"Some (referees) are generous and some are very petty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
FIFA's Referee Committee rejected the West German appeal Wednesday, meaning 
that Voeller will miss Saturday's quarterfinal match against Czechoslovakia and 
Matthaeus will play knowing that one more yellow card will mean that he, too, 
will have to sit out a game. 
</P>
<P>
Under FIFA rules, a player who is red-carded or accumulates two yellow cards 
automatically misses the team's next game. 
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer hoped that FIFA would allow television film of the incidents as 
evidence that Voeller and Matthaeus were unjustly punished. The Bundesliga, or 
West German soccer league, has long allowed film to be used in settling 
disputes. The West German belief is that FIFA's referee observers are ill 
equipped to deal with such matters. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how old the FIFA official in the stands is, or how far he can 
see," said Beckenbauer, who in recent weeks has been scathing in his criticism 
of FIFA's elderly leadership. 
</P>
<P>
No less critical of the refereeing in Italia '90 was Valery Lobanovsky, coach 
of the Soviet Union. After the Soviets lost to Argentina in Naples and were 
effectively eliminated from the tournament, Lobanovsky lambasted Swedish 
referee Erik Fredriksson. 
</P>
<P>
"Fair play should be fair play for everyone," the Soviet coach said. 
"(Fredriksson) does not deserve to be at this level. A referee like him can 
ruin all that a team has built up, sabotage its spirit. That is what happened 
to us." 
</P>
<P>
Even more blunt in his comments was Nikita Simonian, vice president of the 
Soviet soccer federation. Fredriksson, he said, should "pack his bags, burn his 
referee license and leave soccer forever." 
</P>
<P>
Television replays showed that the Soviets twice were victimized by bad calls. 
Against Romania, the Romanians were awarded a penalty kick by Uruguayan referee 
Juan Cardellino even though the foul occurred outside the penalty area. Against 
Argentina, Diego Maradona's deliberate hand ball, when he blocked a Soviet shot 
with his arm, also went unpunished, allegedly unseen by the officials. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Hughes, writing in the International Herald Tribune, made this comment: "A 
camera at that point would have picked out the horror in (Argentine Coach 
Carlos) Bilardo's eye, the sweat on his brow. It would, seconds later, show the 
utter disbelief, and then the relief, as Bilardo realized the Swedish referee 
had missed the hand ball." 
</P>
<P>
The cameras, did, in fact, record the incident, but FIFA has long since made 
its position clear on not using replays to second-guess officials. 
</P>
<P>
In April, in the semifinals of the European Cup between Benfica of Portugal and 
Marseilles of France, film clearly showed that Benfica striker Mats Magnusson 
fisted the ball into the net seven minutes from the end of the game. The goal 
was allowed to stand because Belgian referee Marcel Van Langenhove, one of the 
World Cup officials, was screened and did not see Magnusson use his hand. 
</P>
<P>
Marseilles was eliminated from the tournament and one of its players, England 
World Cup winger Chris Waddle, bitterly complained that television replays 
should be used. Waddle was a member of the English team beaten by Maradona's 
"hand of God" goal in the quarterfinals of the 1986 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate that in modern football there is no video assistance to deal 
with cases such as this," Waddle said. "It would only take a minute, and there 
is no way they can say it would waste time. When a player is injured, it takes 
five minutes to start the game again." 
</P>
<P>
Waddle said FIFA should follow the National Football League's lead and permit 
the use of instant replays. But FIFA remains adamant. 
</P>
<P>
Michel Zen-Ruffinen, FIFA's head of referees, said: "Even watching on 
television it took several replays to be certain that (Magnusson) used his hand 
or arm. And, that said, this kind of thing is part of football. 
</P>
<P>
"We have had several proposals for (the use of) videos from (national) 
federations and individuals, but I do not see how we can use electronic 
equipment to make decisions in a match. 
</P>
<P>
"The match would be completely brought to a halt as it is in America. Each 
disputed penalty, offside and free kick would halt the match for a decision. It 
is not practical. We must not dream." 
</P>
<P>
What FIFA is willing to do for the first time is support the concept of having 
professional referees, something the Italian and Spanish leagues have said they 
would introduce in the near future. At present, referees are paid only expenses 
and a small per diem. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday it was announced that, for the first time in World Cup history, 
the referees would be given a bonus of 5,000 Swiss francs -- about $3,500 -- as 
well as having their expenses paid. 
</P>
<P>
The statement, by Giulio Campanati, president of the Italian Referees Assn. and 
a member of FIFA's Referees Committee, is seen as a first step toward 
professional referees. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, the number of referees who will continue to officiate in 
this World Cup was reduced from 36 to 16. Among those remaining is Vincent 
Mauro, the lone American official in the tournament. Mauro will be a linesman 
in the England-Cameroon quarterfinal match in Naples on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
It is probably too much to hope that the final eight games will be free of red 
and yellow cards. The hope is, however, that their use will be judicious, not 
capricious. 
</P>
<P>
"Referees in the main are men of integrity," FIFA Vice President Harry Cavan 
said last week. "The sendings off are indicative of the fact that referees are 
carrying out their instructions to protect good players. 
</P>
<P>
"The officiating here isn't that bad. Referees are only human and make 
mistakes, just like players and administrators." 
</P>
<P>
Are more such mistakes possible? It's in the cards -- yellow and red.

PEBBLE BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the ocean pounded out a steady beat against the rocky and majestic shoreline 
of the famed 18th hole at the Pebble Beach Golf Links, a sea lion poked his 
head high above the undulating kelp. 
</P>
<P>
A mouthful of fish could wait. Even this slick-skinned swimming mammal, it 
seemed, wanted a glimpse of young Charlie Wi, the wonder from Thousand Oaks who 
is now just a step away from completing a rather astonishing feat. 
</P>
<P>
Wi, 18, who graduated from Westlake High just two weeks ago, swept into the 
final of the 79th California Amateur golf championship Thursday, ousting 
veteran Craig Steinberg of Van Nuys in the quarterfinals and then overcoming 
some superb play from Paul Stankowski of Oxnard in the semifinals, knocking 
down a three-foot birdie putt on the first hole of a sudden-death playoff to 
earn a berth in the championship round. 
</P>
<P>
Wi will take on 39-year-old Gary Vanier of Oakland in today's 36-hole 
match-play championship and could join just a handful of teen-age winners of 
the prestigious event, including PGA Tour players John Cook and Bobby Clampett. 
</P>
<P>
Might Wi be intimidated by the brusque, grind-it-out nature of Vanier, who has 
played golf for more years than Wi has breathed? 
</P>
<P>
"No way," said Wi. "I'll be here to play golf. If he wants to talk and try to 
intimidate me, let him. I can be a jerk too if I want to be." 
</P>
<P>
Beneath the tough front, however, is a young man who at times during his 
remarkable weeklong run on the Monterey Peninsula has been an absolute wreck. 
</P>
<P>
"On the playoff hole I was so nervous I couldn't stand it," Wi said. "I stood 
over that birdie putt to beat Paul and my hands were sweaty and all sticky. 
God, was I nervous." 
</P>
<P>
He had every right to be. It wasn't until last week that Wi learned he would be 
playing in the tournament, having missed qualifying by a stroke in May. But as 
the first alternate, he was summoned just six days before the event began when 
another player withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
Wi didn't start the tournament like a player who planned to be around very 
long. He struggled to a 75 at Cypress Point. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so nervous that day I didn't even want to get out of the car," Wi said. 
"When I did, I forgot my sweater and spent the rest of the day freezing in the 
wind. Then I had a terrible first hole and I said to myself, 'This is going to 
be a very long, short tournament for me.' " 
</P>
<P>
He came back on Tuesday, however, with a sizzling round of 68 at Monterey 
Peninsula Country Club, the second-lowest score of the two-day stroke-play 
portion of the tournament, and entered match play as the No. 3 qualifier behind 
Stankowski and Mark Johnson of Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, he cranked out match-play wins over Mitch Harrison of Campo and 
Randy Bridge of Hollister. 
</P>
<P>
And on Thursday, he took on Steinberg, a 32-year-old optometrist who had 
advanced to the quarterfinals for the third consecutive year and figured to 
make short work of Wi. 
</P>
<P>
It was not to be. Wi rolled over Steinberg, 3 and 1, and then teed it up 
against another Valley-area player, Stankowski, who will be a senior at Texas 
El Paso in the fall and is the defending Southern California amateur champion. 
</P>
<P>
Stankowski, 20, jumped to an early lead when he parred the second hole at 
Pebble Beach and Wi stumbled to a bogey. But Wi evened the match on the par-3 
fifth when he rolled in a tricky, downhill four-footer for par. 
</P>
<P>
On the par-5, 516-yard sixth hole, Stankowski crushed a drive 330 yards, 
sailing his tee shot more than 50 yards past Wi's. But Wi put the pressure on 
Stankowski at the green, sinking a 45-foot birdie putt that broke twice during 
its long roll. Stankowski, however, responded with his own birdie putt from 
eight feet to prevent Wi from winning the hole. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what?" Wi said. "I pushed that putt. I really hit it bad. I can't 
believe it went in." 
</P>
<P>
On the seventh hole, Wi sank a seven-foot birdie putt to take a 1-up lead, and 
he opened a two-hole lead in sensational style by winning the 10th hole. 
</P>
<P>
Wi's drive on the long par-4 went right and over a cliff. He took the penalty 
and dropped a new ball and proceeded to slam a seven-iron from 170 yards that 
nearly went into the cup. The ball hit the green and rolled directly at the 
pin, stopping just two feet shy. He made the putt for a par and a stunned 
Stankowski then missed an eight-foot putt for his par. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just shocked," Stankowski said. "But Charlie is a great player, and 
great players make shots like that." 
</P>
<P>
Stankowski moved to within one hole of Wi with a par on the 13th hole and 
evened the match on No. 14 when he dropped a two-foot putt for par and Wi 
bogeyed. 
</P>
<P>
The two stayed deadlocked to the 18th green, where Wi had a chance to win with 
a 10-foot putt for birdie. But the putt moved left and stopped three inches 
from the cup, forcing a playoff beginning at the first hole. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had to end it on the first hole," Wi said. "Paul can reach the second 
hole in two shots and I can't. I bogeyed the second hole the last three times I 
played it." 
</P>
<P>
End it quickly he did. Hitting his second shot from 130 yards in the middle of 
the fairway, Wi drilled an 8-iron dead at the pin. The ball stopped three feet 
away, and Wi moved into the final by dropping the putt for a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
"I sure kept it close, didn't I?" Stankowski said. "I did all I could do, but 
then Charlie took over on the playoff hole. My hat is off to Charlie. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got off to a good start and went 1-up on the second hole, I knew that 
didn't mean much. I knew this thing was going to go 18 holes. I was wrong. It 
went 19. I can accept the loss a little easier because it was Charlie and I 
know how good he is." 
</P>
<P>
Wi, who will head to Nevada Reno on a golf scholarship in the fall, said he 
plans to bring the championship trophy home tonight. He just hopes he remembers 
what happens. 
</P>
<P>
"After I got behind early today I just looked at Paul and said, 'Wow.' That's 
all I could do. Just 'Wow.' How did I ever come back to beat him? I was so 
nervous I can't remember anything."

PLENTY OF LUCK -- ALL BAD -- COSTS STEINBERG IN QUARTERFINALS FOR THIRD YEAR IN

Craig Steinberg will be back at work today, back to the business of making 
eyeglasses. You can safely bet, however, that he won't be making any with 
rose-colored lenses. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg, you see, won't be in the most cheerful of moods after spending 
several hours Thursday looking at the dark side of golf. 
</P>
<P>
Playing the Pebble Beach Golf Links, one of the most stunningly beautiful 
courses in the world, Steinberg saw the stinking stockyards of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
When others looked out on a heart-warming scene of fluffy sea otters cavorting 
in the water, Steinberg saw oversized rats. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg returned to the quarterfinals of the 79th California Amateur golf 
championship for the third year in a row, something no other golfer has ever 
done. But Steinberg, of Van Nuys, also was trounced in the quarterfinals for 
the third year in a row. Another record. 
</P>
<P>
This time it was 18-year-old Charlie Wi's turn to bring the sky crashing down 
on Steinberg's head, ousting him from the tournament by a score of 3 and 1 in 
match play. Wi, who won later in the semifinals, plays in today's championship 
match. 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg drove home last night. 
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that this saves me the $150 for a hotel room," Steinberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It was his only attempt at humor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating," he said. "Very frustrating. This is three years in a row 
now and making it to the quarterfinals is not overly satisfying anymore. 
There's only one guy who leaves here happy. And once again, it's not me." 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg is an accomplished amateur golfer. He is the 1988 Southern California 
Golf Assn. amateur champion and has made 11 appearances in the tournament, 
which accepts a field of 102 golfers from the several hundred who attempt to 
qualify for it each year. 
</P>
<P>
But none of that matters to Steinberg each year when he makes the trip to the 
Monterey Peninsula, only to be sent home early. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Steinberg was the victim of some fine play by Wi as well as his 
own misfortune. Several times he sent iron shots screaming at the pins only to 
have the ball bounce oddly away from the target. 
</P>
<P>
"People who win this tournament get good bounces, at least a few of them," he 
said. "I didn't get any. I can't recall a single real good break I got all 
day." 
</P>
<P>
The ugliest may have come on the 17th hole, a par-3 that is 209 yards of pure 
beauty stretching toward the sea. 
</P>
<P>
It's beautiful, of course, until you have to play it. Steinberg's tee shot hit 
the middle of the green and hopped weirdly to the right, onto the fringe of the 
green. 
</P>
<P>
He then had a delicate chip shot that he appeared to hit well. But the ball 
came down on the last blades of rough ringing the green and, despite being on a 
steep hillside, stopped dead. 
</P>
<P>
"Incredible!" Steinberg shouted to no one in particular as he watched the ball 
-- and his chances of catching Wi -- die. 
</P>
<P>
An hour later, he was still discussing it. With no one. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't believe what happened," he said. "I could spit on that grass in 
the same place and it would get to the green. That ball stuck like a magnet." 
</P>
<P>
And being so close to the final and a chance at winning the tournament doesn't 
soothe Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always an empty feeling when you lose," he said. "It might even be worse 
when you get this close and then lose."

GLENDALE'S SWANSON WILL END LONG WAIT AND SIGN WITH CSUN

<P>
Apparently ending a lengthy recruitment, Dave Swanson said he will sign 
scholarship papers with Cal State Northridge this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson, a Glendale College high jumper and basketball player, said his 
scholarship papers arrived in the mail Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
After waiting several days for the package, Swanson will return to the CSUN 
basketball office to sign the papers. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great," Swanson said. "I'm getting some sleep now." 
</P>
<P>
Swanson said he will receive a full scholarship, which will include a 
combination of track and basketball aid. He turned down a partial scholarship 
offer to compete in track for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"Northridge was a place where I could do both," said Swanson, who has two years 
of eligibility in each sport. "I'm going to give a total commitment in 
basketball; however, track is something I've really learned to love." 
</P>
<P>
Swanson spent his freshman year at Northridge. He redshirted in basketball and 
was a Division II All-American in track. Swanson, an Alemany High graduate, 
then transferred to Glendale. He redshirted his first year in track before 
setting a personal record of 7-0 3/4 this spring when he finished second in the 
state junior college championships. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-foot-5 swingman, Swanson started two years for Glendale's basketball team 
and was the second-leading scorer last season at 17.5 points per game.

CANNINGS DECIDE TO REJOIN HISTORY OF LA JOLLA EVENT; 
</P>
<P>
TENNIS: AFTER MORE THAN 15 YEARS OFF, THE FAMILY WILL HAVE THREE GENERATIONS 
REPRESENTED IN SEVEN DIVISIONS.

<P>
Their names are strewn throughout the La Jolla Tennis Tournament record book. 
But it has been more than 15 years since a member of the Canning family has 
played in the event. 
</P>
<P>
But the Cannings have come out of hiding for the 74th La Jolla tournament, 
which began Thursday and runs through July 8. And the family name will be 
scattered throughout the draw sheets and ubiquitous on the courts of the La 
Jolla Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
"If they weren't trying to set a record for the most divisions entered, they 
probably set one anyway," said Bob Perry, the tournament director. 
</P>
<P>
In a tournament that features more than 1,000 participants in 43 divisions, 
three generations of Cannings are entered in seven divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The Cannings, who live in Ramona, are not expecting any titles in their 
comeback tournament, but they are hoping to get back into the competitive 
groove. William Canning Sr. said they have been away from tournament tennis 
because of family and business obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Canning Sr., 70, who won the La Jolla singles title in 1947 and 1948 and was 
once ranked as the 18th best singles player in the nation, will compete in the 
father-daughter event with his daughter, Nancy, and in the men's 70s doubles. 
Nancy is also entered in the women's 35 singles. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Canning Jr., a three-time La Jolla father-son champion with his father in 
the early '60s, will return to that division, but this time as the father. He 
will play with 11-year-old Billy and also join his wife, Beverly, in the 
husband-wife division. 
</P>
<P>
The younger generation, Billy and younger brother Danny, are entered in the 
boys' 12 and boys' 10 age brackets. 
</P>
<P>
A former baseball player, Billy said tennis is now his sport of choice. He 
practices almost 20 hours a week at the Ramona Canyon Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to really like baseball, but you only get up to bat every three 
innings," he said. "In tennis, you're in the action every point." 
</P>
<P>
Danny also has been playing less than a year, but it hasn't taken him long to 
catch on. Last week, he won a 10-and-under singles tournament in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
"He could have won a couple of other tournaments, but he always forgets the 
score and gets cheated out of points," Billy said. "He just doesn't concentrate 
sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
William Canning Sr. said he sees a lot of himself in Billy. 
</P>
<P>
"Billy seems to have more of my strokes," he said. "Danny, though, has more of 
the topspin like his father." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Jr., who is recovering from back problems and hasn't played a tournament 
in 15 years, said he is planning on also making a run at the men's 45s next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Seven-year-old Katie would probably be entered, too, but the age divisions 
begin at 10. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Todd Canning, the most famous of the Canning clan, is also skipping 
the event. Canning, the 1947 Wimbledon doubles champion with Doris Hart and 
1947 French Open singles champion, is in England for a reunion of past 
Wimbledon titlists. 
</P>
<P>
William Sr. said it will just feel good to compete again. 
</P>
<P>
"For a while, I just lost interest in entering tournaments," he said. "But I 
think the competitiveness will still be there when I step out on the court." 
</P>
<P>
William Jr. said he could have entered the tournament with his father and been 
"fairly competitive," but he wanted to give his son some experience. 
</P>
<P>
"It was his turn, and he wants to play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Billy realizes he and his father are a ways from duplicating the feats of his 
father and his grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be pretty hard," Billy said. "I guess we'll just use this as 
practice." 
</P>
<P>
Tournament Notes 
</P>
<P>
Donny Isaak, who plays No. 3 for USC, is seeded first in the men's open 
singles, but the women's open singles tournament figures to be more 
competitive. Lisa Seeman, last year's runner-up, is seeded first but figures to 
be challenged by San Diego State's Dorrey Brandt and Susan Hawke, USC's Linda 
Allred and Julie Tullberg, both of whom grew up in San Diego, and former Aztec 
Sondra Mitchell. . . . Tennis legend Pancho Gonzales will be playing in the 60s 
doubles along with Bill Davis, ranked No. 1 in the United States Tennis Assn.'s 
60s singles division. Gonzales and Davis will play their first match Saturday, 
July 7, at 1:30 p.m.

Blue Star Report, a national recruiting publication based in Philadelphia, has 
ranked the San Diego State women's basketball recruiting class for this year 
11th in the nation. It is Coach Beth Burns' first recruiting class for the 
Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
Burns signed a community college All-American and four high school players to 
national letters-of-intent and added transfers from UCLA and Oregon to the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The newcomers include Kieishsha Garnes, a 6-foot-3 center from Hilbert College 
(Hamburg, N.Y.) and member of the 1990 Kodak All-American team; Carmelia 
Bloodsaw, a 5-8 guard from J.O. Johnson High in Huntsville, Ala., a Converse 
All-American who had a 35-point average her senior year; Elisha Johns, a 6-0 
forward who led Winslow High to two consecutive Arizona AAA state 
championships; Tameka McGlawn, a 5-11 forward from Wakefield High in Arlington, 
Va., who was included in Street &amp; Smith's best players in the Southeast, 
and Tammy Blackburn, a 5-8 guard who led Brea-Olinda to the state Division III 
championship in 1989 and a 55-game winning streak before a loss in this year's 
state final. The transfers are Tori Baker, a 5-9 junior guard from Oregon, and 
Michelle Miles, a 5-7 junior guard from UCLA.

SURFING 
</P>
<P>
A pair of surfers from Huntington Beach -- Mark Austin and Nea Post -- won the 
men's and women's open divisions in the National Scholastic Surfing Assn. 
national championships Thursday at the Oceanside Pier. 
</P>
<P>
Austin, a two-time California high school champion from Huntington Beach High, 
defeated Garvin Thorson of St. Augustine, Fla., Rob Machado of Cardiff and Doug 
Sommerville of Solana Beach. Machado had already claimed the national points 
title for the 1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
Cardiff's Ron Phillipy won the AAU master's division, Carlsbad's Banning Capps 
the AAU juniors and Carlsbad's John Salas the AAU longboard.

The Chargers Thursday announced the signing of third-round draft choice Jeff 
Mills, an outside linebacker from Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
Mills, 6-feet-3 1/2 and 238 pounds, is the first of 17 Charger draft choices to 
sign. He was the first of three Charger picks in the third round, the 57th 
player selected overall. 
</P>
<P>
Charger General Manager Bobby Beathard said he hoped signing Mills would help 
speed the signing of the Chargers' other third-round choices -- offensive 
tackle Leo Goeas of Hawaii and wide receiver Walter Wilson of East Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
Beathard said Mills signed a series of three one-year contracts plus an option 
year. Financial details were not released. CURT HOLBREICH

Lotus Wins Copyright Suit: A federal court judge in Boston ruled that the 
keyboard commands and on-screen images of the company's top-selling 1-2-3 
spreadsheet software program for the personal computer are protected by 
copyright laws. 
</P>
<P>
Paperback Software International, which plans to appeal the ruling, argued that 
the copyright applies only to the inner workings of the software, and that the 
commands represented only instructions for the machine. Similar issues have 
been raised in a spate of other "look and feel" lawsuits involving the 
appearance and operations of PC software.

BATTLE OF THE BLONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gaile Robinson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whose blondness looks better, Ivana Trump's or Madonna's? And what is the state 
of the art in cities between Hollywood and New York? 
</P>
<P>
Stylist Gina Furth, whose own hair is flaming red, turns out to be an expert on 
the subject. 
</P>
<P>
Furth, based at the Yuki Salon in West Hollywood, recently made an informal 
study of blond variations during a cross-country trek as part of a television 
project on the Judds, the mother-daughter country music singing team. CBS was 
filming the singers, Furth was styling their hair. Hers is a highly personal 
vision of the state of blondness across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Have you seen much change in blonds over the last few years? 
</P>
<P>
A: I've been doing this for 25 years. The blonds have really evolved. The 
California blond is like nothing else in the world. It's the best blond there 
is. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why is that? 
</P>
<P>
A: Ours is a warmer blond, with more tones. It is a blond-on-blond look instead 
of one all over color. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Have you found people are asking for a specific blond? 
</P>
<P>
A: Candice Bergen. They want that color hair. It's elegant and it's not flashy. 
It has a beige or taupe background and there is no flash. No one ever asks me 
for Madonna. But the two process blonds (bleach and toner) are having a big 
revival since Madonna did hers. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about the time Ivana Trump had solid yellow blond, did anyone ever want 
that? 
</P>
<P>
A: That butter color? That color in this city's light is so hard and offensive. 
Nobody wants to look like that. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What kind of hair styles do Los Angeles women want? 
</P>
<P>
A: Hair is much messier here than anywhere else. It's much sexier. It's wilder, 
but on purpose. It's not like a tossed salad. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What color did you see on the East Coast? 
</P>
<P>
A: In New York there are pretty Connecticut blonds, but in the city they are 
all brunettes. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why? A: It works better in the city's natural light, and it's the more 
formal side of dress. Brown hair lends itself to a more pulled together look. 
</P>
<P>
Q: If they go blond what color do they choose? 
</P>
<P>
A: Same as here, blond-on-blond, that Bistro Garden look. Except we use a 
deeper, richer color base with brighter highlights. The color is similar in New 
York but the contrast between the highlights and base is not as extreme. Or 
they go for the Grace Kelly East Coast blond look, cool and elegant. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Who is a good New York blond, Ivana? 
</P>
<P>
A: She looks fabulous, but it's a more Hollywood look. I didn't see any good 
blonds in the city. They are all brunettes, like Carolyne Roehm and Donna 
Karan, the fashion designers. They wear great blazers and swingy brunette hair. 
It's a rich look. In New York, women are not as pretty as they are put 
together. They look drop-dead. 
</P>
<P>
Q: That takes care of the fashion capitals, what about points in between. 
</P>
<P>
A: In Washington, the women are not concerned with fashion. They talk about 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Q: You can't be blond and talk about issues? 
</P>
<P>
A: You can't be focused on fashion. They don't want to look too flashy or 
stylish because people will want to know how they did that on a politician's 
salary -- which is a legitimate concern. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How about Nashville? 
</P>
<P>
A: Nashville is real glitz. Everyone there is done to death. It's a look all 
its own. Higher heels, wider shoulders and taller hair. They take a trend and 
run with it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How would you describe their hair? 
</P>
<P>
A: That Southern belle look. They all have hairdos. Usually a magnified version 
of the old shag, really jacked up in front and big. And there are tons of 
blonds. Nashville is loaded with bright blonds, either golden yellow or that 
white blond. Everybody gets their hair done. These women, I'm telling you, are 
pretty. They have small noses and wholesome looks like Miss America. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are the country stars you work on in Nashville different from the 
rock-'n'-rollers from Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
A: I love these people. They are very much not in the princess mode of 
Hollywood. They work out of tour buses. They take on a whole different demeanor 
when it comes to real life. Theirs is far more real, they eat at truck stops 
not Spago, Motel 6's as opposed to the Hilton's. They are pretty 
self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Is there a blond mentality? 
</P>
<P>
A: I think for girls who come to Hollywood thinking of being stars, being blond 
is part of the fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Were you ever a blond? 
</P>
<P>
A: I was blond for years. I was younger then and it only looked good if I was 
tan and rested. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are you doing more blonds these days? 
</P>
<P>
A: I've taken a lot of blonds to red recently, to a lighter strawberry red. You 
can't be sure if it's blond or red. As you get older, it is a good idea to 
soften the hard reds or yellows. The more colors you put in the hair the easier 
it is to maintain. Plus, it's more flattering. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Who would keep mousy brown hair? 
</P>
<P>
A: Nobody. They'd go blond.

GOING TO THE CHAPEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you're desperate to be a June bride, it's not too late. There is still one 
day left. And that is 23 hours more than you need to get married in a Las Vegas 
wedding chapel. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Pat Allen, an executive in the Clark County Recorder's Office, 
registered 7,217 June weddings. That's one ceremony every six minutes, which is 
logistically feasible since the wedding chapels are open 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
The state laws of Nevada make immediate-gratification weddings possible, and 
the Clark County Courthouse works on convenience-store hours, dispensing $27 
marriage licenses. 
</P>
<P>
The wedding chapels have one-stop shopping. Charolette Richards, who owns four 
Las Vegas wedding chapels, estimates that most couples spend $150 to $200 on 
the big event. That amount will rent the chapel and buy flowers, photographs, a 
souvenir book to hold the hastily procured license and instantly developed 
photographs, and a cassette tape of the ceremony. Nancy Youngbeck, a 
spokeswoman for Modern Bride magazine, says their research shows the average 
cost of a formal wedding, usually planned months in advance, is $13,300. 
</P>
<P>
Pulling off a Las Vegas wedding is so easy that Gordon Gust, owner of the 
Candlelight Wedding Chapel, where both Bette Midler and Whoopi Goldberg tied 
the knot, estimates 75% of his brides and grooms do it on a whim. GAILE

HOT TO SHOP: HOP A BUS TO BARSTOW'S BARGAIN MECCA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
DEAR HOT: My favorite pastime is discount shopping -- leave the malls to 
someone else. Are there any new places where I can fulfill my wildest shopping 
fantasies? 
</P>
<P>
 -- A.S., Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
DEAR A.S.: The best new discount shopping mecca in Southern California is 
Factory Merchants Outlet Stores in Barstow, which includes Anne Klein, Evan 
Picone, Polo Ralph Lauren, Fieldcrest/Cannon and Royal Doulton stores. It's off 
I-15's Lenwood Road exit on the way to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
If you're not up for the Barstow trip on your own, consider going with Outlet 
Shopping Tours, headquartered in Hermosa Beach. The company is run by Buckita 
Benson, who offers one-day excursions to the center in plush buses. The tours 
are available for large groups (individuals may be assigned to tours that 
aren't filled), and Benson provides mall maps and store brochures. She charges 
$24 per person, which includes beverages; $30 includes a catered lunch. Benson 
suggests booking at least a month in advance. For more information, call (213) 
372-9930. 
</P>
<P>
Another shopping tour is Kathy Bendett's Born to Shop, which began as a 
wardrobe consultation and personal shopping service. Now she's added a variety 
of tours, for individuals and groups, to discount stores, children's shops and 
local arts and crafts boutiques. 
</P>
<P>
Bendett will also customize a tour to shopping preferences. Shoppers are taken 
in mini-vans or buses for full- or half-day tours with an escort who also acts 
as a wardrobe consultant. Full-day tours are $100 and up (lunch not included), 
depending on how customized they are, and reservations should be made a couple 
of days in advance. For more information, call (213) 273-1660. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HOT: I've put the fun back in shopping; I do it on roller skates. This 
works great at Venice Beach (as long as I'm not trying on pants). However, I 
now have all the tank tops I need. Where else can I shop on skates? -- C.S., 
Malibu 
</P>
<P>
DEAR C.S.: Lace up and roll on over to Melrose Avenue. Many stores there 
welcome wheel heads (among them: Warbabies, which sells combat boots, fatigues 
and styled-up Army/Navy surplus-type goods; Maya, the jewelry boutique that 
houses 7,000 pairs of earrings, and Lip Service, known for rock 'n' roll gear). 
</P>
<P>
A few stores have carpeting so warped that their owners caution that even 
roller-derby veterans would have trouble skating there. And some shops 
(including Soap Plant, Wacko, La Luz de Jesus Gallery, Zulu, and Leathers and 
Treasures) report that their insurance policies strictly forbid shoppers on 
wheels. Cowabunga, dude.

DEAR HOT: I thought I'd seen everything. But at my health club, there was a 
woman with pink webbed hands working out in my pool aerobics class. What are 
those things? -- J.N., Culver City 
</P>
<P>
DEAR J.N.: The woman was probably wearing Wave Webs, one of the new products 
designed to increase the natural resistance water provides during exercise. The 
Webs, which come in pink, blue or lime (each with black trim), sell for $12 a 
pair and can be ordered by phone from Hydro-Fit (800) 346-7295). The Eugene, 
Ore.-based firm makes products for water workouts, including "buoyancy cuffs," 
worn on the ankles or arms much like the weights worn by landlocked exercisers.

PATHE FAILS TO LINE UP TIME WARNER BACKING IN BID FOR MGM/UA; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: THE BEVERLY HILLS-BASED COMPANY IS LEFT WITH HALF THE FUNDING IT 
NEEDS FOR THE $1.3-BILLION BUYOUT. IT HAS BEGUN SEARCHING FOR ANOTHER PARTNER. 
</P>

Pathe Communications Corp. confirmed Thursday that negotiations with Times 
Warner Inc., its chief financial backer in its planned $1.3-billion purchase of 
MGM/UA Communications Co., have collapsed. Pathe said it is seeking 
"alternative" sources of support for the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosure, which had been expected for several weeks, leaves Pathe with 
less than half of the funding needed to complete the acquisition. A company 
spokesman said Pathe would try to find a partner to replace Time Warner, which 
had pledged $650 million to the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
"Despite how this will be perceived, Pathe is still confident they can do the 
deal," said company spokesman Craig Parsons. He refused to elaborate, however, 
on the company's plans. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner, which in the past has denied that the deal was in trouble, issued 
a terse response: "We have just seen Pathe's press release, and we are studying 
its implications." 
</P>
<P>
Pathe, which was supposed to complete the MGM/UA acquisition last week, was 
granted a four-month extension after it was unable to come to terms with Time 
Warner. In return, Pathe agreed to increase its non-refundable deposit toward 
the purchase by $100 million, to $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA said it was not surprised by the announcement regarding Time Warner. "We 
have said all along our agreement is with Pathe, and we have what is a very 
good agreement for our shareholders," said spokesman Scott Tagliarino. "Over 
the last two weeks, Time Warner's relationship with Pathe has been in question, 
so we don't believe this is anything earth-shattering." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Pathe and MGM/UA announced that they had reached an agreement 
under which the two companies would merge, if Pathe can find the financing 
needed to complete the deal. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides that MGM/UA stockholders will receive $4 per share on 
July 20, with the remaining $17.50 per share to be paid when the acquisition is 
completed. The major beneficiary of the advance payment would be MGM/UA 
majority shareholder Kirk Kerkorian, who owns 72% of the company. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of the damage done by the breakdown in talks with Time Warner 
remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said it's doubtful that Pathe can recruit another major studio as a 
partner if it was unable to satisfy Time Warner's demands. One entertainment 
executive suggested that Turner Entertainment Co., which already owns the MGM 
library, might step in to gain access to the United Artists library for its 
cable channels. The company denied knowledge of such a deal. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner had agreed to loan Pathe the cash needed to complete the purchase 
in return for the distribution rights to the United Artists library and future 
MGM/UA and Pathe releases. 
</P>
<P>
The loan was contingent on the Beverly Hills-based Pathe and its partners 
providing $600 million in equity toward the purchase. Instead, Pathe offered up 
a financing package composed of a patchwork of short-term loans, asset sales 
and the possible resale of some MGM/UA stock.

Guess Lawyer Offers to Arbitrate Fee: Marshall B. Grossman, chief trial lawyer 
for the Los Angeles clothing maker, withdrew his opposition to the destruction 
of a jury verdict form that had been partly filled out when Guess settled its 6 
1/2-year legal dispute with Jordache last month. Guess' owners regained control 
of the company, but they feuded with Grossman during the Los Angeles County 
Superior Court trial and have refused to pay a $10-million bonus he was 
promised if they won back control. Attorneys speculated that Grossman wanted 
the verdict form preserved as evidence in a fight for the bonus.

DOUGLAS WILL LAY OFF UP TO 4,000 IN LONG BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: THE CUTBACKS ARE PART OF A PLAN BY THE DEBT-LADEN FIRM TO SLASH 
OPERATING COSTS $700 MILLION A YEAR.

McDonnell Douglas said Thursday that it will lay off 2,000 to 4,000 workers at 
its Douglas Aircraft subsidiary in Long Beach as the result of a previously 
announced effort to reduce operating costs by $700 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
When the cost-cutting program was disclosed last week, the St. Louis-based 
aerospace firm said several thousand jobs would be affected at the Long Beach 
operation. The total number of layoffs across the corporation resulting from 
the cost-savings program is still not known, but it has been estimated at about 
10,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
As a part of cuts announced earlier, Douglas Aircraft had already begun layoffs 
of another 4,000 regular employees and 3,000 contract workers. The savings from 
those layoffs were included in the $700-million cost-cutting effort that 
McDonnell announced last week. The additional layoffs will mean that about 
10,000 workers will lose their jobs at Douglas this year. 
</P>
<P>
The cutbacks started when employment at Douglas Aircraft in Long Beach and at a 
related parts-fabrication plant in Torrance totaled about 45,000. In addition, 
Douglas has plants in Salt Lake City; Columbus, Ohio; Macon, Ga., and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
The corporate-wide cutbacks were mandated by Chairman John McDonnell last week, 
following a dismal financial performance over the past year and a somewhat 
risky outlook for the future. The company has run up debt of $2.5 billion and 
is expected to hit $3 billion in debt by the end of this year under the most 
favorable scenario. McDonnell has even raised the possibility that debt could 
reach $3.7 billion by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
At beleaguered Douglas, each of three major aircraft production and development 
programs is running behind schedule, adding to cost, holding down revenue and 
monopolizing management attention. The unit is struggling to cope with a 
variety of basic ills. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to improve financial performance and staunch losses, McDonnell 
said last week: "The hard reality is, we must begin immediately to take further 
strong actions to reduce our costs." 
</P>
<P>
When the layoffs were announced last week, company officials said they would 
include all types of workers but that the job reductions would be concentrated 
in support and overhead areas. That would include administration, planning, 
engineering and related areas. In addition, travel, overtime, advertising and 
the use of consultants are to be trimmed. 
</P>
<P>
The figures for Douglas Aircraft are the first to be disclosed for any of 
McDonnell's nine divisions. Assuming that 3,000 workers are cut at Douglas, 
that leaves 7,000 workers to be cut from McDonnell's other operations, which 
include large plants in Huntington Beach, St. Louis and Mesa, Ariz.

Pickens Walks Out: Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens Jr. and 50 other Americans 
stalked out of the annual shareholders meeting of Koito Manufacturing Co. in 
Tokyo after the Japanese auto parts company refused to give him a seat on its 
board or answer his questions. 
</P>
<P>
Pickens, with a 26.4% stake in Koito, sought at the meeting to win approval for 
seven proposals, including four seats on the 20-member board and an increase in 
the company dividend. A majority of shareholders voted down all seven items. 
Pickens is Koito's largest shareholder.

MEXICO TO ALLOW FOREIGNERS TO BUY INTO BANKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, in a move aimed at returning Mexico's 
banks to private hands and internationalizing the country's financial services, 
proposed legislation Thursday that, among other things, would permit foreign 
investment in banks and stock brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
The principal bill -- a broad measure that would reverse the 1982 
nationalization of banks -- would allow up to 30% foreign ownership of any of 
the institutions. Under a separate bill, foreigners would be permitted for the 
first time to buy minority positions in brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
Passage of the bills is practically assured, because Salinas' party has a 
majority in both houses of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
During the past eight years, Mexico has reduced tariffs and removed other 
barriers on imports but has continued to protect financial services. When 
insurance and other services were opened to foreigners late last year, 
brokerages were restricted to Mexican ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Even before bank nationalization, foreigners could not own stock in Mexican 
banks. And foreign banks were -- and will remain -- prohibited from operating 
branches in Mexico, except for New York-based Citibank, which has special 
status. However, under the proposed law, foreign banks will be allowed to 
provide some services to foreign nationals. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime observers of Mexican banking and finance expressed surprise that 
foreign investment is being allowed but at the same time noted that investment 
restrictions will sharply restrict the number of potential foreign buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Besides limiting foreign ownership to 30%, the law also prevents any person or 
company -- even Mexican -- from owning more than 10% of a bank. And any 
investment over 5% would require special permission. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. banker, speaking on condition that his name not be used, said, "If we 
can't control it, we don't want it." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, few U.S. banks are in a financial position to buy stock 
in Mexican banks. Problems with domestic U.S. real estate loans and lending to 
foreign governments -- including Mexico -- have left them with little to invest 
in ventures that their shareholders would be likely to consider risky. 
</P>
<P>
One investment banker said the most likely foreign market for Mexican bank 
shares is the United States -- and the most likely investment vehicle, American 
depositary receipts. ADRs, the means by which many Americans invest in foreign 
equities, trade like stock in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Mexican investors received the legislation enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
The voteless bank shares that are traded on the Mexican stock exchange 
rebounded after a week of slippage on news that they can be converted into 
voting stock when the banks are privatized. 
</P>
<P>
Former Mexican bankers are seemingly less concerned about restrictions on stock 
ownership than their foreign counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Since losing their banks in 1982, many have become investment bankers or have 
formed stock brokerages. They are said to be using their new skills to form 
investor groups to buy banks once privatization begins.

PEOPLE: FORMER NISSAN EXECUTIVE WILL HEAD FUJI 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A former Nissan executive was elected Thursday as president of Fuji Heavy 
Industries Co., giving Nissan effective control over the slumping manufacturer 
of Subaru cars. 
</P>
<P>
Fuji shareholders approved the selection of Isamu Kawai, former president of 
Nissan Diesel Motor Co., a subsidiary of Nissan Motor Co., at a meeting in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Nissan, Japan's second-largest auto maker, is Fuji's largest shareholder, with 
a 4.2% stake, and its superior in a corporate grouping, or keiretsu. Japan has 
many such groups, bound together by cross-shareholdings, other financial ties 
and common business strategies. 
</P>
<P>
"Fuji would have been probably taken over if it were in the United States, and 
I'm sure even Nissan had difficulty deciding whether it should acquire it," 
said Kimihide Takano, an analyst with Chemical Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
He said Nissan chose a typically Japanese way, taking advantage of its superior 
position in the group to send an executive to exercise control. 
</P>
<P>
"This way, Nissan can obtain the same economic effects as acquiring the whole 
company," Takano said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Nissan plans to use Fuji facilities to expand its production and to 
obtain Fuji's technology in the defense and aerospace industries. 
</P>
<P>
Fuji is one of the nation's largest makers of military, aerospace and railroad 
equipment, but such production accounted for only 20% of its sales last year. 
Eighty percent of Fuji's 1989 sales of $4.3 billion came from automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
1989 sales were down 15% from the previous year, and Fuji ran up nearly $194 
million in debt during the year.

CBS UNVEILS LATE-NIGHT TELEVISION LINEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an attempt to compete in the crowded late-night TV landscape, CBS on 
Thursday announced a late-night lineup that will combine a new comedy from 
Norman Lear with five new action adventure series that will air over five 
different nights of the week. CBS executives said the new schedule will provide 
effective counter-programming to the talk show format that dominates late-night 
TV. 
</P>
<P>
The lineup, announced in Los Angeles at the annual meeting of CBS affiliated 
stations, will face tough competition from "Arsenio Hall" and other syndicated 
late-night talk shows, even on some of CBS' own stations. Since the demise of 
Pat Sajak's talk show a number of CBS stations have chosen Arsenio Hall's show 
and other programs over CBS' current late-night lineup of "Wiseguy" and "21 
Jump Street." 
</P>
<P>
"We're now developing programming for late night the way we were developing for 
prime time," Jeff Sagansky, the new CBS entertainment chief, told the 
affiliates. "We need your station clearances to make this viable." Clearance by 
an affiliate means it carries the network's offerings rather than those of 
other suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
The new Norman Lear series, "Jody Gordon and the News," will divide its half 
hour between two related segments. The first will focus on the life of the 
young TV news producer. When she comes home from work at night, she relaxes by 
watching her favorite TV show, the "Storyteller," whose fantasy stories she 
enjoys. 
</P>
<P>
"Jody Gordon" will premiere in October and will be broadcast at 12:40 a.m. This 
fall the show will be preceded each night by rebroadcasts of "Wiseguy" and 
"Mission Impossible." It will be combined with the new action adventures 
beginning in January. 
</P>
<P>
The new action adventure series are "Judgment Night" from Lorimar Television, 
"Paris Steele" from Louis B. Chesler Productions, "Sweating Bullets" from 
Kushner-Locke Productions, "Slick" from Alliance Productions and "Scene of the 
Crime" from Stephen J. Cannell Productions. 
</P>
<P>
CBS also announced that it will showcase several new talk show hosts in late 
night this summer, including comedian Joy Behar and Chicago radio talk show 
hosts Steve Dahl and Gary Meier. They will alternate on a nightly series 
beginning at 12:40 a.m. called "The Midnight Hour." 
</P>
<P>
CBS, which was negotiating its numerous late-night deals right up until this 
week, was not able to show pilots from the new shows to the affiliates. "CBS is 
going to have to behave like a syndicator selling these shows to the stations," 
said Jeffrey Epstein, chief financial officer for King World, the syndicators 
of Oprah Winfrey's talk show. "They made a mistake in not having another show 
ready when Sajak ended," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't making a decision to move away from CBS when we decided to carry 
Arsenio," said Hank Yaggi, the general manager of WUSA-TV, a Washington 
affiliate. The station had signed up to carry the Hall talk show beginning in 
January before CBS made its new late-night plans. "Arsenio changed the face of 
late-night," said Yaggi, "and anybody would have to look at carrying him."

A psychiatrist pleaded guilty Thursday to trading stock on inside information 
he obtained during sessions with the wife of financier Sanford I. Weill. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what I did was wrong," Dr. Robert Willis said. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know it was against a specific law, but I knew it was illegal." 
</P>
<P>
Willis, 51, pleaded guilty to two counts of securities fraud before U.S. 
District Judge Miriam Cedarbaum. He was indicted in July on 46 counts of 
securities and mail fraud. Forty-four counts were dropped as part of a plea 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Willis faces up to 10 years in prison and $500,000 in fines at his sentencing 
Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
He admitted that he traded in BankAmerica Corp. stock in January and February, 
1986, after he learned from Weill's wife that her husband, the former chief 
executive of Shearson Loeb Rhoades, was attempting to become chairman of 
BankAmerica. 
</P>
<P>
She also told him that Weill's financial backers intended to invest in 
BankAmerica if he was successful. 
</P>
<P>
The indictment alleged that Willis violated his professional and legal duties 
by disclosing the information to his broker and by buying $171,130 worth of 
stock in BankAmerica. 
</P>
<P>
He sold the stock Feb. 21, 1986, after an announcement about Weill's attempt to 
become a BankAmerica executive, making a profit of $27,475.

MANUFACTURERS HANOVER'S CUTS MAY IDLE 1,000; 
</P>
<P>
BANKING: THE HUGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION ALSO DISCLOSED A ONE-TIME CHARGE, BUT 
WOULDN'T SAY HOW MUCH.

Manufacturers Hanover Corp. said Thursday that it will take an unspecified 
one-time charge in the second quarter related to a restructuring that analysts 
say may result in the loss of more than 1,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The charge, which did not surprise analysts, stems from efforts to reduce 
expenses, according to a preliminary prospectus covering an offering of 
Manufacturers Hanover preferred stock. 
</P>
<P>
Bank spokesman John Meyers had no comment on whether there would be layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Several analysts estimate that Manufacturers Hanover, the nation's 
eighth-largest banking concern, is attempting to slash $100 million in annual 
expenses. To do so, they say, more than 1,000 jobs may have to be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers Hanover would not specify how large its charge might be, but the 
prospectus said it expects it to be less than operating earnings for the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In the regulatory filing, the bank said only that operating earnings for the 
quarter ending Saturday would be below the $96 million in operating earnings 
reported first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers Hanover traditionally releases its second-quarter earnings report 
in late July, in conjunction with a regularly scheduled board of directors 
meeting. But full details of the restructuring plan might not be outlined until 
fall, industry watchers say. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers Hanover in May announced a realignment that split its wholesale 
bank business into four groups, eliminating a layer of management. The move is 
expected to generate "significant annual savings," the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the bank said it expects non-performing assets to increase by 15% 
"in the near future, principally as a result of problems being experienced by 
Donald J. Trump, one of the corporation's major real estate customers." 
</P>
<P>
Trump missed a $30 million-interest payment due Manufacturers Hanover earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers Hanover and Trump's other major banks -- Citicorp, Chase 
Manhattan Corp. and Bankers Trust Co. -- recently negotiated a $65-million, 
five-year bailout and debt-restructuring deal. It includes delayed payments on 
some debt.

ANIMATED LOOK AT THE ART OF FILM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first time Spike and Mike, two La Jolla cartoon promoters, showed "Broken 
Down Film," the movie projectionist almost had a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
He saw the black line that separates each frame rolling up on the screen, and 
thought he had a broken-down film, said Spike, who's also known as Craig 
Decker. (Decker got his nickname playing in a '50s rock 'n' roll band.) 
</P>
<P>
Decker and partner Mike Gribble, best known for their Festivals of Animation at 
the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art, forgot to tell the projectionist 
that's all part of the cartoon chicanery. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese animator Osamu Tesuka sends his little cartoon hero jumping between 
frames to escape the clutches of the scruffy bad guy, said Decker. Another 
feature of the five-minute short is its segue from black-and-white to color. 
</P>
<P>
The "Broken Down Film" and 15 other cartoon classics begin screening tonight at 
the La Jolla museum, where they will play at various times through Aug. 5. 
</P>
<P>
The Best of the Festival of Animation includes four cartoons nominated for 
Academy Awards and one that received an Oscar. They range in length from just 
under two minutes to 11 minutes, and they come from Japan, Hungary, the United 
States, Bulgaria, Italy and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fly," the Oscar winner, is a four-minute short about a fly chased by 
humans inside a house from the point of view of the fly. It was produced by 
Ferenc Rofusz of Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Other shorts include: 
</P>
<P>
* The "Big Snit," created by Canadian Richard Condie, "is in my opinion the 
absolute, the number one best," said Decker. "It has everything -- great 
animation, character design, charm, outrageous humor and a political-moral 
statement." 
</P>
<P>
An elderly couple are playing a game of Scrabble oblivious to a nuclear war 
starting outside their door. The elderly man says it must be some kind of 
parade going on, and the camera pans to the confusion and pandemonium in the 
streets outside. His wife leaves the game board for a minute only to look back 
and catch him cheating by moving her game pieces around. 
</P>
<P>
"Condie is a comedy genius," Decker said. "We'd buy his films sight unseen." 
</P>
<P>
* "Self Service," produced by Italian animator Bruno Buzzetto is a funny film 
about mosquitoes who tap into the big toe of a sleeping man, said Decker. Soon 
they are selling the blood from his toe to other mosquitoes at a roadside stand 
which evolves into a corporation and a big manufacturing operation. 
</P>
<P>
* "A Crushed World" is an artfully made film by Boyo Kanev of Bulgaria. The 
background scenes are made entirely of cardboard, and each character is 
fabricated from paper. The silent film recorded with a music sound track 
portrays a day in the life of a Bulgarian city. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the films are discovered at animation festivals, such as the one 
partner Gribble is attending in Yugoslavia this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Very few animation artists just walk through our doors," Decker said. "We have 
to scour the world and battle for films. It's like fishing. We have to throw 
98% of them back because they're too depressing or too long. We have to sift 
through a lot of sand to find the gold." 
</P>
<P>
Working with artists from Communist countries has also been difficult, he said. 
Some films from the Soviet Union take as long as four months to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage the art of animation, the partners have taken to co-producing 
films. They visit art schools, looking for good films, and they also have 
several animators working on salary, which allows them to do cartoons as an art 
form rather than work for a corporation, Decker said. 
</P>
<P>
Once assembled, the cartoon festivals appeal to a broad range of people, he 
said. "It's one of the few events where you see all ages, and all types of 
people. At one show, I saw guys in two-piece suits, and behind him a guy with a 
Mohawk and students and elderly people. 
</P>
<P>
"The show is entertaining and highly humorous from beginning to end," Decker 
said. "It's just one good film after another. I'd buy a ticket myself." 
</P>
<P>
 For show times and ticket information, call 551-9274. Tickets are $6 in 
advance, $6.50 at the door.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: STAGE / NANCY CHURNIN: REP GETS MUCH-NEEDED LIFT FROM 
'LATINS ANONYMOUS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The success of the San Diego Repertory Theatre's season opener, "Latins 
Anonymous," an extended sold-out hit at the Lyceum Space, is a balm that's 
soothing the wounds of last year's season at the Rep. 
</P>
<P>
The show is selling all of its tickets -- every night -- with attendance 
averaging 93% to 100%. It has been extended to July 8, and further extensions 
are possible, at least through Aug. 19, when the Rep has tentatively rented the 
space to a show between the run of "Latins" and its next scheduled show in the 
Lyceum Space, "Cymbeline," which starts previews Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
The renter is "When Friends Collide," the latest creation from the "Suds" team 
of Bryan Scott, Melinda Gilb, Steve Gunderson and Susan Mosher. Will Roberson, 
who directed "Suds" and "Lady Day at Emerson's Bar &amp; Grill," two monster 
hits for the Old Globe Theatre, will direct. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Rep, which took it on the chin from subscribers last year for a 
risky series of world premieres that could have been called hit-or-miss if 
there had been hits, is not out of the woods yet. 
</P>
<P>
Subscriptions hover at about 3,500, down from last year's high of 6,500. 
Managing director Adrian Stewart described the state of the theater as being 
"very fragile and very worrying. It hinges on our ability to raise contributed 
revenue." 
</P>
<P>
What the Rep needs to raise in its 15th anniversary season is both the 
subscription level -- to about 6,000 -- and contributed income -- to $726,175, 
or 30% of its $2.1 million budget (reduced $300,000 from last year), said 
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
If it doesn't achieve this goal in 60 to 90 days, San Diego may find itself 
with three theaters in crisis campaigns, Stewart said, referring to the La 
Jolla Playhouse, which is scheduled to end its $1-million capital campaign June 
30, and the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre Company, which needs to raise who knows how 
much to resume its 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
A representative from the La Jolla Playhouse said a statement regarding the 
status of the playhouse's crisis campaign will be issued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Money is, if anything, tighter than usual in the arts community, given these 
simultaneous campaigns. But at least the company could not have a more 
auspicious start to this critical season than its current revue spoofing Latino 
stereotypes, written by the four actors who play a version of themselves on 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
Producing director Sam Woodhouse, on a rehearsal break from "Burn This," 
opening at the Rep's Lyceum Stage July 18, said that, although the show's 
initial success has "wildly exceeded" his expectations, he now thinks it may 
have the potential to develop into another "Six Women With Brain Death or 
Expiring Minds Want to Know." 
</P>
<P>
"Six Women With Brain Death" ran for nearly two years, ending in August 1989, 
making it the longest-running show in San Diego history. 
</P>
<P>
But what Woodhouse finds especially sweet about the success of "Latins 
Anonymous" is the way it demonstrates how one of the theater's newer programs, 
Teatro Sin Fronteras (Theater Without Boundaries) can work in developing new 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the goals of the Teatro Sin Fronteras project are to expose general 
audiences to Latino work and to bring in Latino audiences. The show is doing 
both, playing to an audience of 60% Anglos and 40% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
At least one of the actor/writers, Luisa Leschin, would have to leave the show 
if extended past July 15 because of other contract obligations. But the Rep has 
a built-in extension option for the show through August, and Woodhouse said 
Leschin agreed to have her part recast. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the big question at the theater is if the Rep can get its 
"Latins Anonymous" audience to come back for the rest of the shows in the new 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope we will be able to convert them to subscription ticket bases," Stewart 
said. "We hope that the people who did not renew their season tickets on the 
basis of last year's season will change their minds. We need them to change 
their minds." 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing a theater that is fighting for its life needs is adverse 
publicity," said David Herring, the lawyer for the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre 
Company, who has been trying to stay low-key about the theater's recent 
falling-out with patron Elizabeth North. 
</P>
<P>
But it would take more illusionist than lawyer to downplay North's refusal to 
donate the last $35,000 of her $75,000 pledge to the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre 
Company by the June 26 deadline in her contract with the Gaslamp. 
</P>
<P>
North promised to donate the money as part of a contract with the Gaslamp in 
which the smaller of the company's two houses on 4th Avenue was renamed the 
Elizabeth North Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The theater has extended her a deadline until the end of the month, said 
Herring. The hope is that North will either deliver or step back from the donor 
agreement, allowing the Gaslamp to find a new donor and namesake for the space. 
</P>
<P>
The contract stipulates that, for 15 years, "This theater shall at all times be 
a currently operative theater for theatrical purposes." 
</P>
<P>
North claims that, because the 99-seat house shut down operations after the 
closing of "Party of One" May 5, it has violated its agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The contract, however, covers the event of a time lapse between theatrical 
presentations: "Should a time lapse occur, it shall be treated cumulatively and 
shall become additional allotted time added to the above agreed 15-year term." 
</P>
<P>
Herring said he would add the time the theater is dark, from the closing of 
"Party of One" to the July opening of Nehemiah Persoff, who is renting the 
space to produce and star in "Drinking in America" to the allotted 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
North said she interprets the words "currently operating theater" to mean a 
theater currently operated by the Gaslamp, not rented out to other producers of 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
Herring is heading for a vacation this week and won't be back until July 9, he 
said. In the meantime, North has scheduled a meeting with another Gaslamp 
benefactor, Ernest Hahn, for whom the theater company named the Hahn 
Cosmopolitan Theatre and Hahn's son, Ron Hahn, who is a member of the Board of 
Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
If the money hasn't been paid when Herring returns, he said he will take "what 
actions are necessary." 
</P>
<P>
He declined to say what such actions would be. 
</P>
<P>
PROGRAM NOTES: 
</P>
<P>
The Playhouse Pay What You Can performance of "Life During Wartime" is 
Saturday. Tickets will be available at the door. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Two different theatrical takes on the Fourth of July: The Old Globe Theatre has 
canceled shows in all of its three theaters on Independence Day, but will offer 
theatergoers two tickets for the July 1, 2 and 3 performances of "Cobb," "White 
Man Dancing" and "As You Like It" for $17.76. The La Jolla Playhouse will keep 
its theaters open July 4, but will start selling $10 tickets to "Life During 
Wartime" and "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" beginning at 10 
a.m. at the box office on July 4. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Forums will follow the first three preview nights of "Drinking in America," 
July 7-9 at the Elizabeth North Theatre. Eric Bogosian's 14-character, one-man 
show starring Nehemiah Persoff. The show, which is about addictions -- from 
alcohol to drugs to sex to work and power -- officially opens July 19.

AT THE GALLERIES / LEAH OLLMAN: 'RE-UNION XX' IS A BLURRED AND DIFFUSED VISION 
OF CENTRO

<P>
Often the most eagerly awaited guests don't show up at reunions. Such is the 
case with the Centro Cultural de la Raza's "Re-Union XX," an exhibition 
celebrating the Centro's 20th year in operation. 
</P>
<P>
"Re-Union XX" functions neither as a representative survey of the Centro's 
visual arts programs, nor as a selection of its "greatest hits." Instead, the 
show is a diffused, blurred vision of the Centro's engagement with the arts. 
Some of the participating artists, such as Salvador Torres and Victor Ochoa, 
were founders of the Centro. Others, such as Alfred Quiroz and Graciela 
Ovejero, have exhibited there in recent years. All of the artists included have 
had some form of affiliation with the Centro, but the same is true of an even 
greater number of artists not included in the show. 
</P>
<P>
The Centro, in Balboa Park's Pepper Grove, was born of a will for 
self-determination in the Chicano community, and for 20 years it has 
energetically lived up to its mandate to create, promote and preserve Indian, 
Mexican and Chicano art and culture. That will went flaccid in the planning of 
the current exhibition, however, and the result is less of a celebration than a 
polyglot parade of varying intentions and accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
Excerpts from some of the Centro's most powerful shows, by artists Esther 
Parada, Barbara Carrasco, Gronk, the Border Art Workshop (Taller de Arte 
Fronterizo) and others are scant or absent altogether. The arbitrary seems to 
have taken over the willful in the planning of this show, and the celebration 
suffers accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
The show moves haltingly from simple sketches to allegorical tableaux, from 
commercial art to social documents. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Quiroz makes a dramatic return to the Centro with his large oil pastel 
drawing, "Christopher Columbus Discovers America and Introduces the Spanish 
Language." Here, he retells in his characteristic snappy, satirical style the 
story of an event long glorified and distorted by traditional American 
histories. 
</P>
<P>
Columbus, surrounded by several of his fellow explorers, stands proudly on 
American soil, one foot firmly planted on the head of a native. He holds aloft 
a flag, whose central emblem is the gleaming bar of gold that hovers in 
Columbus' imagination. To one side, a dumbfounded explorer ponders a crude 
nautical map of India, wondering where they went wrong. Another sets foot and 
sword on a freshly decapitated native, while reveling in the glory of his gold 
loot. A pirate, pocked with bulging red sores, rapes a native woman, 
introducing to her culture a new disease. 
</P>
<P>
In the background, a monk cheerily carries a large wooden cross to the shore, 
setting in motion a centuries-long course of exploitation, violence and 
oppression enforced in the name of Christianity. Quiroz's image, in black and 
white with gold, blue and red accents, may be exaggerated in style, but 
historically it is closer to the truth than most standard accounts, visual or 
verbal. 
</P>
<P>
"Hispania," an installation by Graciela Ovejero, provides another of the show's 
sporadic, compelling encounters. A large square of raw canvas hangs from the 
wall by two long nails, whose forceful contact with the fabric appears to have 
caused it to bleed red paint. Ovejero's reference to martyrdom overlaps with a 
suggestion of sexism -- the "His" in "Hispania" is underlined. Two gray, 
plaster-encrusted briefcases hang from the canvas, and five more form a 
semicircle on the floor beneath it. Their presence perhaps reinforces the 
artist's view of Latino culture as male-dominated, but Ovejero leaves the 
installation's meaning open. 
</P>
<P>
Salvador Torres' sketches and paintings of the building of the Coronado Bay 
Bridge and the ensuing development of Chicano Park beneath its pillars lend a 
strong sense of history to this fragmented show. They provide brief, eyewitness 
accounts of an event that divided, then mobilized and unified the local Chicano 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Other participants, such as Ochoa, David Avalos and Mario Torero also give the 
show a sense of historical weight, due to their continuing activism in the 
Chicano and larger community. Their work reflects on issues of identity, 
expression and belief, through a potent mixture of passion and humor. 
</P>
<P>
 The show continues through July 29.

IT'S ROUGH AND JAGGED, BUT SAVATAGE SHOWS A SCRAP OF ORIGINALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a field crowded with cookie-cutter metal bands virtually indistinguishable 
from one another, at least Florida's Savatage seems more to have been hewed out 
with a jagged can lid or some such. At Anaheim's Bandstand on Wednesday, the 
quintet played with an intensity (measuring somewhere between Motorhead and 
Canada's Nomeansno) and modicum of originality that set it apart. 
</P>
<P>
While singer Jon Oliva got his voice down at Ed's Screech 'n' Growl and the 
rest of the group had their amps set on "pummel," there was a distinctive 
musicality to their thrashings. On songs drawn from the group's four albums, 
guitarists Criss Oliva and Christopher Caffery churned up some heaving 
dissonances that would have done noise artist Glenn Branca proud. 
</P>
<P>
Lyrically, Savatage falls pretty much in the post-apocalyptic doom school, 
though Wednesday the words were chiefly lost in the tumult and an awful sound 
mix. It's scarcely ironic then that during the anti-violence of "Of Rage and 
War," the group's slam-pitting fans and the club's bouncers were engaged in a 
limited ground war of their own. 
</P>
<P>
The group's amps were covered by structures with paintings of shrouded ghouls 
flipping the finger, and steps led to the top of these boxes. There was a 
nearly Spinal Tap-like humor to seeing Savatage's members dramatically scale 
these things, only to have to crouch to avoid the club's low ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Second-billed Cold Sweat might have been better named Tepid Drool, as it 
delivered a pandering rote-rock set capped by a version of Willie Dixon's "I 
Just Want to Make Love to You" that sounded as if Foghat was the band members' 
idea of roots. 
</P>
<P>
The show was part of a Wednesday night concert series (L.A.'s Junkyard will 
appear on July 18), that is sandwiched amid Bandstand's usual bookings of 
country music and Top 40 dancing. 
</P>
<P>
As a concert venue, the 940-capacity hall is a mixed blessing. It certainly is 
roomy, with four tiers allowing fair sight lines to the stage from most points. 
There are three full bars, a burger restaurant (which closes early), two 
corralled dance floors in addition to the area in front of the stage, five pool 
tables and even a cloak room. But with its segmented layout, the club may be a 
tad too expansive, with its farther reaches feeling detached from the stage 
area. 
</P>
<P>
The sound Wednesday was abysmal, cavernous and distorted, though it's difficult 
to say how much of that was due to the room or the particular sound mix. In 
decor, the venue seems lost in time, a mishmash of disco lights and '70s rock 
trappings (Where else are there still posters of Donna Summer, ELO and Olivia 
Newton-John?). 
</P>
<P>
As for the show's logistics, putting a headliner on at midnight might work in 
Hollywood, but in Orange County -- where people tend to have real jobs -- that 
practice might not be entirely in the interests of the customers. Savatage's 
set didn't wind up until 1:20 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
But let's get down to what really matters: This place has great air 
conditioning! You could chill dessert forks in there. This could be an 
important feature to remember, now that California's climate has come to 
resemble the internal temperature of a Susie Homemaker oven.

PREVIEW: THE BEACH AND REGGAE CROWD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
What's better than beach music in a surf bar? Reggae and ska, say the operators 
of Toes Tavern in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
The nightspot is part of a three-club chain with a decided beach motif. 
Surfboards hang from the ceiling. Pictures of waves and surfers cover the 
walls. The DJ booth is a lifeguard stand. 
</P>
<P>
And at a pre-Fourth of July party Tuesday night, the ocean theme will crest 
with the giveaway of a $500 long board. 
</P>
<P>
But the music that night won't be from Beach Boys or Jan and Dean. 
</P>
<P>
The group Jah Bone will play songs by Bob Marley, the English Beat and UB40. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun music, party music," said Jah Bone drummer Ken Kobel. "It's more 
danceable than beach music because you get more of a back beat that people can 
pick up." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night's performance will be Jah Bone's debut at the 55,000-square-foot 
Toes Tavern in Canoga Park, which opened in January. But the six-member group 
is a veteran of the sister clubs in Redondo Beach and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"In Redondo we get the beach crowd," Kobel said, "and in Pasadena it's more of 
a college crowd. They seem to enjoy the music the most. From what I hear, the 
Valley crowd is like the one in Pasadena, so I expect we'll have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
Bar manager Dave Radanovich said Toes Tavern draws a young clientele. 
</P>
<P>
"They're 22 to 30 or 35," he said. "It's the white-bread crowd." 
</P>
<P>
The Jah Bone instrumental lineup consists of guitar, bass, drums, keyboard, 
saxophone and trombone. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us were in a group called the Generals for three or four years," Kobel 
said. "We played all around Redondo -- the Lighthouse, beach parties, the Toes 
club there." 
</P>
<P>
Toes Tavern owner John Stafford said the nightclub chain is named after Toes 
Beach in Playa del Rey, which in turn was named for the long-boarding 
expression "toes over." 
</P>
<P>
He said reggae music in a surf club "really gets the people moving." 
</P>
<P>
That's gnarly, Marley. 
</P>
<P>
 Jah Bone will play at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday at Toes Tavern, 7230 Topanga Canyon 
Blvd., Canoga Park. No cover or drink minimum. Information: (818) 347-7668.

have reserved $10,000 tables for the dinner honoring Mandela, and a busload 
from Santa Ana's Episcopal Church of the Messiah will go to Mandela's Coliseum 
benefit. . . . Patrick Rhodes of the Orange County Black Actors Theatre says 
people admire Mandela if only because "he's holding onto his beliefs and still 
going forward." Steve Emmons and Chris Pasles

KABUKI: The Grand Kabuki of Japan, appearing this weekend at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, survives in part because of Faubion Bowers, one-time 
secretary to Gen. Douglas MacArthur. . . . Bowers tried to persuade the general 
to lift the ban on Kabuki in postwar Japan, "but he was a cultural numskull. He 
never went to a concert, never went to a play, never read a book -- except the 
Bible. 'Kabuki?' he said. 'What's that?' "

HOT TOPIC: The county heat records falling this week (B1) were set in 1907 when 
heat was harder to handle. . . . The Santa Ana Daily Evening Blade reported an 
"ice famine," in which ice was rationed for refrigerators only. . . . Ice 
shipments from Los Angeles were stopped at the height of the heat wave, causing 
intense resentment here. . . . June has long been a freakish month in Orange 
County. The highest June temperature occurred early in the month (112 degrees 
on June 1, 1879), but a meager 87-degree record for June 14 has stood for 86 
years.

CARBON CANYON HAMLET HIT HARD BY FIRESTORM

La Vida Hot Springs Cafe on Carbon Canyon Road is a local institution where 
millionaires rub elbows with bikers over barbecue and beer. 
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday, flames came within 100 feet of burning the storied 
establishment that was built on the site of a 19th-Century stagecoach stop. The 
fire late that night roared over a ridgeline and from around a bend and seemed 
intent on devouring the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"Get out of there, Don!" one female bystander yelled at restaurant owner Don 
Himes after he ran in to retrieve some belongings. 
</P>
<P>
The firestorm destroyed or damaged 14 homes and blackened 6,640 acres before 
being contained Thursday, but the restaurant was spared. 
</P>
<P>
The scenes of fear and panic gave way Thursday to a weary cleanup and 
accounting of losses at the site of the Carbon Canyon fire. A 29-year-old 
transient has been arrested on suspicion of starting the fire, which caused 
widespread devastation in sensitive natural areas on the Orange-San Bernardino 
County line. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than four miles of telephone cable were burned, knocking out 
service to about 900 Pacific Bell customers. Crews were working Thursday to 
restore telephone service in the stricken area. Southern California Edison also 
lost two power poles and a cellular phone tower, and Southern California Gas 
has abandoned service in the affected area until the fire is extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
Eight firefighters suffered minor injuries. About 400 firefighters remained on 
the fire lines Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In Riverside County, meanwhile, a blaze started by the U.S. Forest Service to 
reduce fire hazards in the Cleveland National Forest got out of hand and 
charred 2,200 acres above Corona, destroying 12 structures, including some 
homes, and temporarily shutting down Interstate 15. Eleven firefighters 
suffered smoke inhalation and heat exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
That blaze, called the Bedford Canyon fire, was declared 40% contained late 
Thursday as it burned toward non-populated areas in the wilderness. Fire 
officials had no estimate on when that blaze would be brought under control. 
More than 500 firefighters were working in steep terrain with hand tools and 
bulldozers to build fire lines around the flames. 
</P>
<P>
In the Chino Hills, residents evacuated from two communities were allowed to 
return to their homes Thursday afternoon, and the seven-mile Carbon Canyon Road 
was reopened to traffic. About a dozen residents of Olinda Village in Brea and 
122 residents of Sleepy Hollow in San Bernardino County spent Wednesday night 
at Red Cross shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Fire threatened but did not touch Olinda Village, a bucolic community of about 
500 residents, although horses became so frightened by the swirling smoke that 
they broke a corral at the Hidden Valley Ranch on one end of town. Deer, 
rabbits and other wildlife could be seen racing in advance of the flames, some 
singed from the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the 200 residents of Sleepy Hollow, a hamlet hardest hit by the Carbon 
Canyon fire, returned to a scene of devastation. Once-lush hillsides were 
blackened with ash and the skeletal remnants of trees. At least 12 homes in the 
community and surrounding Chino Hills neighborhoods were destroyed by fire, and 
another two sustained damage. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst one we've ever seen," said longtime Sleepy Hollow resident 
Don Brinay, 63, a retired engineer who saved his stucco home by spraying it 
with a garden hose through the night. 
</P>
<P>
One of the largest structures lost was an 8,000-square-foot home at the top of 
Hillside Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, all that remained of one two-story house were four dozen 
cinder-block columns that made up its frame, a chimney, the charred remains of 
several cars and an indoor swimming pool, the water blackened by charred wood. 
</P>
<P>
As residents surveyed their properties, they recounted a night of terror. Many 
had stayed behind in Sleepy Hollow to protect their homes, and most were caught 
by surprise when fire descended so rapidly on the community late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like a tidal wave of flame," said Sleepy Hollow resident Robin 
Overholser, 36, whose home emerged unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
Jim and Yvette Magliozzi, who stayed with their split-level ranch house, spent 
five hours watering down their home and the homes of their neighbors. At one 
point, a eucalyptus tree in their back yard burst into flames. The couple sent 
their two children to stay with relatives. 
</P>
<P>
The couple stayed up most of the night because of the smell of charred wood and 
the fear that the fire would again come their way. 
</P>
<P>
"The smoke was so bad you couldn't sleep. It just looked like a city with all 
the embers going," said Yvette Magliozzi, 31, who on Thursday was helping her 
husband care for pet dogs, cats and a goat that had been temporarily separated 
from their owners during the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Wolverton, 40, a 15-year resident, remained with her home for all but 
half an hour, when she went down to the road for some fresh air. Wolverton 
praised firefighters for saving not only her home but the entire community. 
</P>
<P>
"I just gave him (a firefighter) a big old hug," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Himes, the owner of La Vida Hot Springs Cafe, was particularly appreciative of 
a five-engine strike team dispatched from the Los Angeles County Fire 
Department that saved his 64-year-old building. 
</P>
<P>
"All I need is a couple of hoses and we can fight this s.o.b.," an exasperated 
Himes had said earlier Wednesday evening as the glow of fire illuminated a 
nearby ridgeline. 
</P>
<P>
The firefighters took up defensive positions on the roof of the cafe and along 
a creek bed. When fire ignited thick stands of bamboo congesting the creek bed, 
Himes thought it was all over for his business. But the firefighters trained 
their water hoses on the crackling flames and kept the fire back. 
</P>
<P>
Janet Smith, a nearby canyon resident, looked on worriedly as the popular 
landmark faced doom. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a happy place," Smith said as oak trees popped and exploded under the 
intense heat. "This is where people from all walks of life come." 
</P>
<P>
In Sleepy Hollow, Brinay and his wife, Sue, who have lived in the area for 30 
years, were more critical of the firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
"The residents saved the houses," said Sue Brinay, 65. 
</P>
<P>
The couple were upset because, they said, no firefighters were around when 
flames reached their home. 
</P>
<P>
"We are really upset," Sue Brinay said. "There was not one (firefighter)." 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Dan Young of the Orange County Fire Department, however, said units were 
there. Young said firefighters, faced with making split-second decisions, were 
more likely to try to save those houses where brush had been cleared away in 
compliance with the Fire Department's request -- the houses with "the most 
likelihood of being saved." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a tactical decision," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So many homes were closely surrounded by trees and brush that fire officials 
marveled that more damage was not done. 
</P>
<P>
"It was designed for disaster," Capt. Bruce Brown of the California Department 
of Forestry said at a Chino Hills command post late Wednesday night as embers 
still flew through the sky, igniting new hot spots. "It could have been a bad, 
bad situation." 
</P>
<P>
But Casey Carter, 42, a Sleepy Hollow resident on Hillside Drive, said only so 
much brush can be cleared away and only so much fire danger can be mitigated. 
</P>
<P>
"Where do you clear it? All the way to the cement in Newport Beach?" Carter, 
whose home was saved, asked as he watered down the parts of his lawn that were 
still smoking. "You can't clear away 100-year oak trees." 
</P>
<P>
Close proximity to the wilderness was also the downfall of residents whose 
properties were lost in Riverside County's Bedford Canyon fire, which at one 
point sent mile-high columns of smoke towering into the sky from the foothills 
above Corona. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire came up like a blowtorch," said Bob Moore Jr., whose parents' home 
barely escaped serious damage in a canyon abutting the Cleveland National 
Forest. "The heat was tremendous." 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials estimated Thursday that 12 structures in the unincorporated El 
Cerritos community were destroyed by the Bedford Canyon fire. Kim Bolan, a 
California Department of Forestry spokesman monitoring the blaze, said the 
structures included homes, barns and horse corrals. 
</P>
<P>
Though largely confined to chaparral-covered wilderness, the blaze raced late 
Wednesday toward Interstate 15, prompting the California Highway Patrol to shut 
down the freeway for an hour as flames crossed over in places. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost rear-ended somebody because smoke from the fire was so bad," said 
Katie Seilsopour, a Riverside resident who was driving home from work in 
Corona. 
</P>
<P>
The Bedford Canyon fire began on June 19 when the U.S. Forest Service ignited 
the "prescribed burn" under then-ideal (cool and humid) weather conditions, 
said district forest ranger Suzanne L. Olson. 
</P>
<P>
The fire jumped the control line Sunday afternoon, however, and by Wednesday 
had flared into a raging inferno under 105-degree temperatures and high winds, 
Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We never expected it to get out of hand as it did," she said. 
</P>
<P>

CARBON CANYON FIRE 
</P>
<P>
The Carbon Canyon fire burned 6,640 acres, destroyed or damaged 14 homes and 
forced evacuation of hundreds of Chino Hills residents before being contained 
at 4 p.m. Thursday. Most of the destruction occurred in and around Sleepy 
Hollow, a hamlet of about 200 residents.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; 
</P>
<P>
$16.3 MILLION OKD FOR 1990-91 SPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER ADAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council this week approved a $16.3-million budget for the 1990-91 
fiscal year. Sagging revenues and the increasing financial burden of complying 
with new state regulations have put the brakes on new spending, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is now about the 10th year that the city has had to curtail some major 
capital improvements because of a lack of funding," City Manager Robert Nelson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Among city programs affected by the spending crunch are pier and beach repairs, 
street construction and building repairs. While spending will increase 4.7% 
overall compared to last year's budget, new spending on capital improvements 
will be cut by 13.4%. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said certain state practices have contributed to the city's financial 
pinch. One is the state's passage of new regulations without giving cities the 
money needed for them. 
</P>
<P>
"They require us to do this and that and say we don't need to give you any 
money because you can charge fees," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
But charging fees to cover the costs of new programs is not easy for cities, 
Nelson said. "You have to meet the state mandate, but then you have to make the 
political decision of charging your electorate to pay for it." Residents often 
resist new fees, he added. 
</P>
<P>
There is only one new city staff position planned for next year, and one of the 
tasks of that new employee will be to help the city comply with state 
regulations for air quality and waste management, Nelson said. The addition of 
an administrative aide for the Developmental Services Department will cost more 
than $37,000 in salary and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Another state practice causing problems for Seal Beach is the allocation of 
sales tax revenue to cities on the basis of where items are sold. Nelson said 
this means cities must skew development decisions in favor of building more 
retail stores or face the alternative of seeing the tax revenues generated by 
their own residents' purchases go to neighboring towns. 
</P>
<P>
Nelson said Seal Beach has refused to approve more businesses in pursuit of tax 
revenues. As a result, about 42% of the sales tax generated by residents' 
purchases goes to other cities. 
</P>
<P>
He said a fairer way to distribute revenues would be based on population. 
</P>
<P>
The new city budget also provides for a 5% general salary increase, although 
specific adjustments are still being negotiated with the Seal Beach Police 
Officers Assn. and the Orange County Employees Assn. CHRISTOPHER ADAMS

<P>
'VERY TENTATIVE' SCHOOL BUDGET OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with enrollment figures that continue to slide, the Huntington Beach 
Union High School District has adopted a tentative budget for 1990-91 that 
includes a $1.4-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
However, the district can easily cover the shortfall in the $78.2-million 
spending plan by tapping into the $3.2-million balance from last year, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the district has $5 million stashed away in a special reserve fund 
set up in anticipation of such deficits. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, board members, assuming the decade-long enrollment decline would 
continue, began funneling lottery revenue into an account created to bail the 
district out of future budget crunches, said David Hagen, assistant 
superintendent for business operations. 
</P>
<P>
"But this tentative budget is very tentative," Hagen said, pointing to the 
uncertain level of state spending this year. "We still don't close out our 
books on this year for 30 days. Plus, we have no idea how much money we'll be 
getting from the state. So things can drastically change within the next 
month." 
</P>
<P>
The budget is based on a 3% cost-of-living adjustment. If the state's 
contribution is lower than that, the district would dip further into its 
reserve accounts, Hagen said. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment, which has plummeted from a high of 21,200 in 1978-79 to 14,000 this 
past school year, is projected to level off by the mid-1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Until then, the district will continue to draw on reserves, Hagen said. After 
the emergency fund is exhausted, board members will begin implementing $11.6 
million in spending cuts. JOHN PENNER

PRIZE PIG DELIVERS IN A BIG WAY

<P>
Shortcake, the Orange County Fair's mascot pig, failed the public relations 
test and gave birth to 12 piglets Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Although excited by the births, fair officials had hoped Shortcake would time 
the blessed event a little closer to the July 11 opening day of this year's 
fair. 
</P>
<P>
"This year we are saluting pigs," said fair spokeswoman Lynda Conway. "A pig's 
gestation period is three months, three weeks and three days, and we thought 
she was due July 1." 
</P>
<P>
A normal litter is between eight and 10 piglets, although pigs can have up to 
15 in a litter, Conway said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortcake, a 450-pound, 16-month-old Yorkshire-Hampshire, was a prize winner at 
last year's fair and was named this year's mascot, Conway said. 
</P>
<P>
Shortcake gave birth to six piglets in January. Those pigs, which now weigh 
between 180 and 200 pounds, have been adopted by members of the 4-H and Future 
Farmers of America and will be shown at this year's fair. 
</P>
<P>
Fair-goers may view the newest piglets, as well as other animals, at Centennial 
Farm on the fairgrounds. The one-acre farm is a replica of an actual working 
farm with crops and animals, a windmill, a henhouse and an aviary, Conway said. 
</P>
<P>
It has been a permanent exhibit at the fairgrounds since October. 
</P>
<P>
"City dwellers in Orange County who don't know an awful lot about farm animals 
and agriculture can visit the farm," she said. "We've got goats, dairy cattle, 
sheep, rabbits, a turkey and different kinds of pigs." 
</P>
<P>
One of the more unusual animals is a pot-bellied pig named Oliver whose 
underside almost touches the ground. Oliver, Conway insists, likes to watch CBS 
news anchorman Dan Rather every night. 
</P>
<P>
Fair officials were busy finding names for Shortcake's piglets (boars and gilts 
in farm lingo). Meanwhile, mother was reportedly doing fine. 
</P>
<P>
The fair runs July 11-22. MARY ANNE PEREZ

NEW SCHOOLS BUDGET INCLUDES SHORTFALL

<TEXT>
<P>
The Tustin Unified School District's tentative $44.7-million budget adopted by 
the school board this week includes a $2.1-million shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
District officials anticipate that expenditures will exceed income by $819,000. 
</P>
<P>
A state requirement for a 3% reserve is responsible for the remainder of the 
shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shortfall when you just talk about revenues and expenditures," said 
Chief Business Administrator Paul Fisher. But the expected beginning and ending 
balances are positive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are tight but we have a balanced budget," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the budget -- 85% -- will be spent on salaries and benefits, with 
14% devoted to materials and services. The budget includes money to hire 11 new 
teachers to accommodate an increase in students. 
</P>
<P>
District officials anticipate an average daily attendance of 10,782 students, 
up 290 from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
The final budget will be presented Sept. 4 after a public hearing.

COAST GUARD OKS WIDENING OF BRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Coast Guard on Thursday announced its approval of an application by 
the city and Caltrans to widen the Newport Boulevard bridge. The endorsement is 
the last one needed before the city seeks bids for the $3.3-million project. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which is expected to be under way by September, will mean an 
additional northbound lane over the bridge on 32nd Street. The lane will 
provide an exit for vehicles heading east on Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
According to City Manager Robert L. Wynn, the additional width on the boulevard 
will mean "a great deal of relief to vehicles leaving the (Balboa) peninsula." 
The city estimates that the extra lane should reduce congestion at the 
intersection of Newport Boulevard and Via Lido by about 30%. 
</P>
<P>
But during the yearlong construction period, congestion will continue to be a 
problem for traffic leaving the peninsula, Project Manager John Wolter admits. 
</P>
<P>
"We've designed this thing to maintain two traffic lanes in all directions, but 
there will still be sometimes when the road's going to be closed to one lane," 
Wolter said. "We'll be very happy when this project is complete." 
</P>
<P>
The widening project will also add a bicycle lane to the east side of the 
bridge. LAURA MICHAELIS

CITY COMPILES TIPS ON REDUCING TRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As part of a campaign to inform residents about a new recycling program, the 
city has compiled a list of tips for reducing the amount of garbage generated 
by each household. 
</P>
<P>
The tips, published in the city hall newsletter, include buying products in 
bulk quantities with minimal, recyclable packaging; avoiding disposable items 
such as Styrofoam, paper plates or disposable diapers, and donating used 
appliances and furniture to charities so the items can be used again. 
</P>
<P>
The city General Services Department has also provided the name of a company 
that offers to remove names from some bulk mail lists to reduce the amount of 
paper thrown away as junk mail. Interested residents can write to the Mail 
Preference Service, Direct Marketing Assn., Six E. 43rd St., P.O. Box 3861, 
Grand Central Station. New York, N.Y. 10163-3861.

CITY PLANS SPECIAL TRASH COLLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of Costa Mesa can now do some summer cleaning to get rid of oversize 
items and save a trip to the dump at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
For the eighth year, city officials approved a special citywide trash pickup 
for eight weeks beginning this week. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council agreed to pay Costa Mesa Disposal Inc. $31,130 to handle the 
project, in addition to $7,235 in dump charges. Residents will receive notices 
one week before their pickup date. 
</P>
<P>
Special pickup items should be kept separate from regular trash but put in the 
same location. Crews will pick up mattresses, refrigerators, water heaters, 
washers and dryers, stoves, sofas, lumber and furniture. Workers will not pick 
up tires, tree limbs, asphalt, cars, chemicals, hazardous waste, concrete, 
dirt, oil drums or paint cans.

OFFICER GETS LIFT IN PICKUP, CATCHES FLEEING SUSPECT

<P>
Officer John Tucker was losing his foot race with a suspected robber when a 
"good Samaritan" in a pickup truck stopped to give him a lift. 
</P>
<P>
Tucker hopped in the bed of the truck and was soon able to catch up with and 
arrest Shere Kahn Orr, said Santa Ana Police Cpl. 
</P>
<P>
Dan McDermott. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began about 2:30 p.m., shortly after Tucker got off his motorcycle 
to write a traffic citation. He noticed a man running out of the Potato Bin 
market at 1605 W. 1st St. with a clerk chasing after him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The clerk told Tucker that the man had robbed him at knifepoint, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Orr, 23, of Santa Ana, apparently was pulling away from the officer when the 
man in a truck offered Tucker a lift. 
</P>
<P>
"The officer jumped into the bed of the truck and he shortly overtook and 
apprehended the suspect," McDermott said. "The good Samaritan then left without 
identifying himself or giving the officer a chance to thank him." 
</P>
<P>
Police have requested that the driver of the truck notify police so he can be 
"appropriately recognized," McDermott said. 
</P>
<P>
Orr was arrested on suspicion of robbery and taken to Orange County Jail.

SUSPECT IN CANYON FIRE TELLS A MUDDLED STORY;

ARSON: IN JAILHOUSE INTERVIEW, TRANSIENT SAYS HE WAS TRYING 'TO GET HIGH OR 
SOMETHING. . . . THERE WAS NOTHING TO DO OUT THERE.'

<P>
A disturbed transient arrested on suspicion of starting a brush fire that 
charred more than 6,600 acres in Orange and San Bernardino counties offered 
conflicting and often apologetic accounts Wednesday as to how the fire started. 
</P>
<P>
During a jailhouse interview, Peter Diaz Reyes initially said he started the 
fire accidentally while trying to boil some coffee in the dry hills of Carbon 
Canyon near Brea. He gave fire investigators a similar version of events after 
his arrest Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
But he went on to give a markedly different, and sometimes confused, account, 
saying that he lit the blaze out of boredom and frustration. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying, you know, to get high or something. There was nothing to do out 
there," he said. At one point, the husky, unshaven 29-year-old man said he 
hoped that starting the fire might get him some attention from his parents so 
that "maybe they'll take me to a restaurant or something and buy me some food." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Reyes said he lit a stack of leaves afire because "I was upset and 
angry, depressed." 
</P>
<P>
The fire was set about 11 a.m. Wednesday in two locations, a quarter-mile 
apart, on the north side of Carbon Canyon Road across from Carbon Canyon 
Regional Park in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes, a homeless man from Blythe, near the Arizona border, appeared shocked 
when told that the fire had raged out of control for hours and destroyed or 
damaged 14 homes in its path. 
</P>
<P>
"God. Did the people panic about the fire -- they turned it off, the Fire 
Department, didn't they? They should have," Reyes said, fidgeting nervously in 
the medical ward of the Orange County Jail, used to house inmates with mental 
or physical problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Do I have to pay for the damage?" he asked repeatedly. Then he added: "I would 
have paid for all that stuff. If I find a job, I'll go out and pay for all the 
damage." 
</P>
<P>
Reyes said he had been wandering in Orange County for several weeks before he 
came across a "gas company" -- the Santa Fe Energy Co. building -- and decided 
to take a nap under a nearby tree Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
When he awoke, Reyes said, someone at the gas company told him to leave the 
premises and, some time later, he broke some windows at the building. Asked why 
he broke the windows, he said the breaking of the glass "had a pretty noise to 
it, like chandeliers." 
</P>
<P>
Then, Reyes said, he lit a stack of dry leaves on fire with some matches he had 
found at a local grocery store and, a few minutes later, lit a second fire 
nearby. "I knew what I was doing -- lighting a fire. . . . I lit the gas 
company on fire," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole place set on fire. The wind was blowing and the fire went really 
quickly. Everything was on fire, the grass, the leaves. . . . It looked like 
somebody dropped a bomb on the place." 
</P>
<P>
Although disoriented as to times and details, Reyes said he had spent some time 
behind bars for what he described as petty thefts in the Blythe area, probation 
violations and assault with a deadly weapon after he attacked his father with a 
steak knife. 
</P>
<P>
Court and police officials in Blythe and Riverside County did not provide 
specifics on Reyes' convictions, but Lt. Bob Grady, head of investigations in 
the Blythe Police Department, confirmed Reyes' general account of his criminal 
history. He said Reyes was never implicated in any arson as far as he knew. 
"It's a small town, and I remember him as a kid on the streets. I wouldn't say 
he was a real good kid, but he wasn't real bad either." 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Jail psychiatric officials, citing confidentiality restrictions, 
declined to discuss their examination of Reyes or whether he has any history of 
mental health problems. But some fire officials have already formed their own 
impressions from having talked to him. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't seem to be extremely reliable," said Orange County Fire Capt. Dan 
Young. "I don't think he's entirely with the program." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Ted Johnson contributed to this report.

MEMORIAL SERVICE WILL BE HELD FOR SCHOOLTEACHER CHRISTOPHER POPEJOY

<P>
A memorial service will be held Sunday for the son of well-known residents 
William and Nancy Popejoy. Christopher Todd Popejoy, a junior high school 
teacher, died Sunday in an off-road vehicle accident on a friend's ranch in the 
Sacramento area. He was 27. 
</P>
<P>
Popejoy, who was working toward a master's degree in education at National 
University in Sacramento, was driving his four-wheel-drive vehicle when it 
overturned, killing him and injuring a passenger. The accident occurred on 
private property in Elk Grove, located about 15 miles south of the state 
capital, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
"Chris died doing something he loved," said his 30-year-old brother, Matt 
Popejoy. "He had a zest for life that a lot of people have never experienced. 
He went full steam ahead, eyes wide open. He squeezed every precious moment out 
and probably experienced more in 27 years than most people do in their entire 
life." 
</P>
<P>
His parents, 10-year Newport Beach residents, are active supporters of the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center, the Adoption Guild of Orange County and 
the Balboa Bay Club Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
William Popejoy is also a principal of the Irvine-based Robert M. Bass Group, 
which last year bought out American Savings Bank in a government-assisted 
transaction. He served as chairman and chief executive officer of the bank 
before the buyout. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Popejoy taught history and English at Andrew Carnegie Junior High 
School in Fair Oaks, near Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
He previously worked as a substitute teacher in South Central Los Angeles and 
the east San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
He was a graduate of the University of Southern California and a member of 
Delta Sigma Phi fraternity. Raised chiefly in the Beverly Hills area, he 
graduated from California Preparatory School in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his parents and his brother Matt, he is survived by another 
brother, Parry Popejoy, and his godchildren, Christopher Ales and Jessica 
Masserman. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's memorial service will be held at 3 p.m. at Mariners Church, 1000 Bison 
Ave., Newport Beach. In lieu of flowers, the family asks that donations in 
Christopher Popejoy's name be made to Victory Outreach Church in Los Angeles.

MIKE PENNER: TITANS BUILD SPORTS COMPLEX A STEP AT A TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By now, we've learned to accept Cal State Fullerton for what it is, a school of 
hard knocks. By now, we know that Titan is Greek for learning to live with 
less. 
</P>
<P>
So no one was floored when the final draft for Fullerton's on-campus sports 
complex -- a mere 12 years in the making -- was submitted this week missing 
such minor details as: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A football locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Restrooms on the east side of the football stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Benches on the east side of the football stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Restrooms, concession stands and a press box inside the baseball stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A flat soccer field. 
</P>
<P>
All of these luxury items will eventually be added, or so it is hoped, possibly 
during this century. But a budget had to be met and corners had to be cut, so 
for the moment, they are stashed away under the generic heading Additive 
Alternates. Future home improvements. A wish list, awaiting only a corporate 
Good Samaritan -- or, knowing Fullerton, more creative fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
Buy a raffle ticket, help send a Titan to the showers. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the whole thing sounds more simplex than complex. Without a locker 
room, football players will have to trudge back and forth from Titan Gym before 
and after games. Without creature comforts, visiting fans will have to sit on 
backless concrete steps and wait in line outside portable toilets. Without the 
$130,000 Cambridge drainage system, the football/soccer field will be "crowned" 
instead of flat to allow for water runoff -- as well as disappearing tailbacks 
on opposite-end sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
Does this bother Fullerton football Coach Gene Murphy? 
</P>
<P>
"Just put it up so we can play," he says between sighs. "Just get it up." 
</P>
<P>
Murphy has been waiting more than a decade for something, anything, even one 
shovelful of dirt. "When I was hired in 1980," he says, "Donald Shields (then 
the university president) told me there'd be a stadium up in '83. Then I heard 
there'd be one in '89. Then in '91." 
</P>
<P>
And now, finally, it's scheduled for '92. With no frills attached. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just looking forward to the ground-breaking," Murphy says. "I want 
somebody else to build a football stadium here besides me." 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, when Murphy was told he'd have to build the Titan football program 
from the ground up, he did just that. Renting some bleachers from the Long 
Beach Grand Prix and enlisting players and coaches as hard hats, Murphy 
constructed Fullerton's first on-campus football facility, a 9,000-seat Erector 
Set. 
</P>
<P>
It lasted two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"After the second year, it just got too much for the players and the coaches," 
Murphy says. 
</P>
<P>
So, for the rest of the '80s, the Titans went on the road. Even for home games. 
They played them at Santa Ana Stadium, which is about 30 minutes south of 
Fullerton and no man's land for a program trying to survive in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
One look at Santa Ana Stadium, according to Murphy, was enough to trash weeks' 
worth of recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
"Shoot, yes," he says. "We lost lots of kids because of that. We lost kids 
within our own conference because of it." 
</P>
<P>
A new facility is no guarantee for better recruiting, as UC Irvine has shown. 
Check out Bill Mulligan's won-lost record since his Anteaters traded dingy 
Crawford Hall for the Bren Center and its color-coordinated pastels. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Murphy will take his chances. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, we're playing three games at home and nine on the road," says 
Murphy. "To a high school (recruit), that's not too attractive." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans are playing three home games this year because they sold two of 
them. When you're drawing 2,000 and playing in Santa Ana, those gate guarantees 
in Fresno can get tempting. With a real home facility, the thinking goes, 
Fullerton will have more incentive not to sell out. 
</P>
<P>
Not that anyone's expecting the new stadium to do the same. Expectations, as 
always, are realistic. In 1992, the stadium will seat 10,000 -- it will have 
the capability to expand to 30,000 -- but the Titans will be happy if it's 
half-filled. 
</P>
<P>
"Two thousand fans sitting in a 30,000-seat stadium would be like a BB in a tin 
can," says Sal Rinella, Cal State Fullerton vice president for administration. 
"At the start, 10,000 is more like it. We want to grow into this complex." 
</P>
<P>
Grow is the operative word here. Add a drainage system in '93, a baseball 
pavilion in '94, a locker room in '95. They can call it Lego Field. Add a new 
block whenever you can afford one. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy and Rinella point out that it has been done before, at Fresno State, 
which now plays host to the California Bowl in 30,000-seat Bulldog Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were looking for a precedent, we looked at Fresno," Rinella said. 
"Their support building wasn't ready when the stadium was. The football players 
went to the locker room in the physical education building for halftime. They 
had portable toilets. Fresno did it the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Rinella insists that "even if we don't raise another dime, we'll still have a 
workable, successful facility. . . . We've been dealing with inadequate 
facilities for so long, it's going to be terrific to have some place of our 
own." 
</P>
<P>
To be a Titan is to take what you can get. And what the Titans are getting in 
1992 is one plain-wrapped, bare-boned, simply functional sports complex -- 
featuring an on-campus football stadium with no additives. 
</P>
<P>
If you ask Murphy, it's the healthy alternative.

Realtors Contribute: The North Orange County board of Realtors recently 
presented a $5,000 check to Fullerton Interfaith Emergency Services, operator 
with the Salvation Army of a food distribution center for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
The check followed an emergency plea for financial assistance from the food 
bank, which found its shelves all but bare. 
</P>
<P>
The center typically helps feed 400 families, or about 1,600 people, a month. 
In April, it received requests for help from 2,800 people. 
</P>
<P>
The North County realty board sponsors a food drive for the center each 
Christmas season and its 1989 drive netted more than 50 tons of foodstuffs, as 
well as several thousand dollars in cash. 
</P>
<P>
But the near-doubling of the center's caseload, which interfaith center 
Executive Director Barbara Johnson said might have had its roots in the 
temporary closing of the Share Our Selves center in Costa Mesa, has emptied the 
shelves a lot faster than is normal.

Home Away From Home: Ever feel like you just can't get far enough away from 
home to get away from home anymore? 
</P>
<P>
The builders conference was held at the Moscone Convention Center in San 
Francisco, a very long stone's throw from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
But about 25% of the various panelists at the four-day event, as well as a 
hefty portion of the design, construction project and marketing program award 
winners, were from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
And across the street from the main entrance, a new parking structure was going 
up, although nothing yet was poking above ground level. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a large truck trailer belonging to a subcontractor. It was painted a 
brilliant white with a big orange painted on its side. 
</P>
<P>
The subcontractor? Saddleback Roofing of Orange.

Lyon Co. Will Send Buyers to Paris by Way of Coto de Caza 
</P>
<P>
Any savvy home shopper these days can reel off lists of new developments that 
are offering to pay closing costs, provide loans with reduced interest rates 
during the first few years, kick in $10,000 to $20,000 in decorating and 
landscaping allowances, or even reduce the list price. 
</P>
<P>
The William Lyon Co. generally doesn't have to resort to incentives to move its 
houses, which tend to be priced under $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
But even a general's strategy (founder William Lyon is a retired Air Force 
major general) can go awry. The Lyon Co. appears to be stuck with some 
slow-moving, mid- to high-$300,000 models in a development near Coto de Caza. 
</P>
<P>
To help sell the homes -- and to differentiate its incentives from all the 
others offered by builders with an oversupply of $300,000 to $500,000 homes -- 
the Lyon Co. has been offering price reductions upon close of escrow. 
</P>
<P>
But in the new phase, which opens Saturday with 10 of a planned 25 homes going 
on the market, the company will be giving buyers a round-trip flight to Paris 
plus seven days in a hotel in the romantic French capital.

UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN COUNTY JUMPS TO 3.2% 
</P>

<P>
Propelled by a seasonal influx of job seekers, Orange County's unemployment 
rate jumped to 3.2% in May from April's 2.9%, the state Employment Development 
Department reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
As it has for more than two years, the county's jobless rate remained the 
lowest in Southern California and third lowest of the state's larger counties, 
said Eleanor Jordan, EDD labor market analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Total unemployment in the county climbed to 44,100 in May, the state estimated, 
up from 40,900 in April. Jordan said the increase came from the normal early 
summer addition to the labor force of early college graduates and job hunters 
moving in from out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
There were no significant changes from April in any of the job categories the 
state tracks, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
But the total number of jobs in the county has grown slightly over the past 
year, she said, hitting almost 1.23 million in May, a 2.1% increase from 1.2 
million in May, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all of that increase of 25,100 jobs came in the service, government and 
finance-insurance-real estate sectors of the county's economy, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing lost 1,700 jobs during the 12-month period, with most of loss -- 
1,500 jobs -- occurring in the high-technology sector and reflecting a 
nationwide slowdown in the computer business. 
</P>
<P>
Non-durable manufacturing posted a small gain of 500 jobs for the year, mainly 
in food processing and the printing industry.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: K MART WINS BATTLE WITH THREE D

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three D Departments Inc., operator of bed and bath specialty stores, lost a 
round Thursday in its 3 1/2-year breach-of-contract lawsuit against K mart 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. District Court in Chicago granted K mart a summary judgment dismissing 
claims by Three D that K mart violated a contract in November, 1986, when it 
closed 30 Designer Depot stores in which Three D operated leased bed and bath 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
Three D spokesman Frank Kane said the company plans to appeal the court's 
decision. K mart officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Kane said Three D, which operates 33 stores, is asking for unspecified damages 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
For the nine months ended April 28, the company reported earnings of $514,000 
on sales of $30.9 million, compared with net income of $639,000 on sales of 
$29.5 million in the year-earlier period.

RANDY LEWIS: ARTLESS COUNCIL RATTLES ITS FUNDS AT SCR'S STANCE; 
</P>
<P>
A COMPLAINT ABOUT A FLYER SENT OUT BY SOUTH COAST REPERTORY SUPPORTING NEA 
RESULTED IN COSTA MESA'S HOLDING UP ALL THIS YEAR'S FUNDING TO ARTS GROUPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Get out your score cards, folks, because this is a tricky one. 
</P>
<P>
The players: South Coast Repertory, the Tony Award-winning theater company in 
Costa Mesa; the Costa Mesa City Council; one teed-off resident; the beleaguered 
National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The situation: The Costa Mesa City Council voted last week to hold up all this 
year's grants to local arts groups -- $175,000 worth -- because a resident 
complained about a flyer SCR sent out recently. In the leaflet, SCR officials 
stated their support for the NEA, which has supplied federal money to the 
company for years, and asked playgoers who agree with them to voice their 
feelings to their congressmen and senators. 
</P>
<P>
The complaint: Maybe some city money was used to print the leaflet. If true, 
the city would have been underwriting SCR's stance on a political issue -- at 
least in the eyes of Mayor Peter F. Buffa and other council members who agreed 
with him to hold up all arts grant money, not just SCR's allotted $30,000, 
while conducting an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The way I read this, these government officials won't give government money to 
any arts group that spends government money to publicly defend government money 
for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Did you ever get the feeling the elevator at City Hall doesn't go to the top 
floor? 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line: SCR officials have quickly and courteously sworn up and down 
to the mayor and the council that they did not use any city funds to produce 
flyers, that city money has been used only for community service programs, such 
as the productions SCR takes to local schools. 
</P>
<P>
The one positive aspect of the whole episode is that it proves one individual 
indeed can make a difference in the workings of government, i.e., the Costa 
Mesa resident who brought the issue up at an earlier council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
But it doesn't say much for the council's opinion of the value of the arts in 
general and specifically of the one arts group in the city that has won 
national recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's time for the council members to take another look at their own 
motto. Costa Mesa is, you might recall, supposed to be "the city of the arts." 
It says so on just about everything the Chamber of Commerce prints up. 
</P>
<P>
But council members must not have been hanging around the C of C office much 
lately, for all it took was one upset voter to shout "Fire!," and without so 
much as looking around for any hint of smoke, the Grand Poo-Bahs of Goat Hill 
hosed down the city's entire arts community. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, at the same meeting the council voted to give $400,000 to the 
promoters of "Festival of Britain Orange County -- 1990." This event, to take 
place in the fall, will include several arts performances around the county. 
But "BritFest" is primarily a retail sales promotion for British-themed 
merchandise at the South Coast Plaza shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
It wouldn't take a complete cynic to view that vote as a political statement, 
that the only activities worthy of significant financial support are those that 
result in a chorus of chimes at local cash registers. 
</P>
<P>
If the council members could see beyond their noses, or past their reelection 
campaign coffers, they might realize that, in a way, everything South Coast 
Repertory does can be viewed as a political statement. 
</P>
<P>
The most obvious statement SCR makes is through its refusal to do conventional, 
polite Neil Simon or needless revivals of decades-old musicals. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the messages in the works they do stage. Remember their staging 
of Richard Sheridan's "The School for Scandal," which lampooned society types 
who have nothing better to do than sit around and stick their noses in other 
people's affairs? 
</P>
<P>
Or their 1988 production of Arthur Miller's "The Crucible," which railed 
against the lynch-mob mentality of knee-jerk reactionaries who act on hearsay 
and ignorance rather than on truth and common sense? 
</P>
<P>
Even their version of David Mamet's "Glengarry Glen Ross," a play that 
shish-kebabs the salesman's nonstop hucksterism, might have hit home -- if 
they'd paid attention. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was in the best interest of SCR officials to submit meekly and 
calmly point out that there was no transgression after all. That way, they'll 
probably still get their money when the city takes up the issue again next 
week. And then SCR can go about its business of trying to give Orange County 
theater lovers something worth viewing, and thinking about, season in and 
season out. 
</P>
<P>
If it were me, though, I'd buy five tickets (out of my own pocket, of course) 
to the Grove Shakespeare Festival's latest offering and send the council 
members over for a complimentary object lesson in "Much Ado About Nothing."

HIGH LIFE: A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS; 
</P>
<P>
A GIRL MOTORCYCLE RACER? YES, INDEED, YOU READ IT RIGHT

<P>
Careening through the desert at speeds of up to 50 miles per hour, all the time 
risking far more than a broken fingernail or a scraped elbow, Denise Haslett 
has found her place in the male-dominated sport of motorcycle racing. 
</P>
<P>
Haslett, a 17-year-old senior at Orange High School, has been riding 
motorcycles since she was 4. 
</P>
<P>
The major influence has been her father, Rick, who Denise says had been racing 
for years, even before she was born. 
</P>
<P>
"It was different for me," Haslett said. "Usually, sons follow in their 
father's footsteps, but for me, he (my father) just kind of led me into it." 
</P>
<P>
Though Rick Haslett primarily raced dirt bikes, he also drove race cars for a 
short period. "He always pushes me to do my best," Haslett said of her father, 
who stopped racing a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that motorcycle racing is typically considered a man's sport, 
Haslett finds it perfectly natural. 
</P>
<P>
Said her mother, Betty: "I don't think it's unusual for her because it's been 
in our family for years. It was just natural for her to go into it because it's 
what she knows." 
</P>
<P>
When Haslett got her start, she rode ATC three-wheelers purely for recreational 
purposes. It wasn't until she was 10 that she moved up to one less wheel. 
Today, she rides a new Honda CR125 dirt bike. 
</P>
<P>
Riding has always been a family affair; the Hasletts head for the Mojave Desert 
at least two weekends each month. 
</P>
<P>
Though none of her circle of friends at Orange High are motorcycle riders, 
Haslett said, "the friends that know me really, well, just accept it, but some 
of the others think it's kind of weird." 
</P>
<P>
Boys, she said, offer mixed reactions to her pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
"It's either a positive or a negative to them," Haslett said. "They think, 
'Hey, that's really cool,' or else they can't accept a girl doing it." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until April of 1989 that Haslett made the decision to ride 
competitively rather than strictly for recreation. 
</P>
<P>
She began her racing career in the novice division of the Dinosaur Grand Prix 
at Glen Helen near San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Being one of only two girls in the race, Haslett held her own through a course 
of sand, packed dirt and water holes, and finished fourth in the first two 
heats. In the third heat, she fell and dislocated a shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"After I dislocated my shoulder, I thought, 'Do I really want to do this any 
more?' " she recalled. "And, sure enough, I got right back on." 
</P>
<P>
Paying little heed to the inherent dangers of her sport, Haslett said, "There 
aren't too many girls into it. I don't know why. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
But apparently Betty Haslett does. Haslett said her mother "stays in the camper 
while I race because she's too afraid to watch." 
</P>
<P>
Though the family gives Haslett its unwavering support, her mother said, "When 
she first started, I was a nervous wreck." 
</P>
<P>
And now? 
</P>
<P>
"Denise is a good rider," Betty Haslett said. "I have confidence in her. I 
think it's safer for her to be out on a dirt track than zipping around on the 
freeway." 
</P>
<P>
Haslett has yet to compete in her second race, since amateur competitions only 
come around every six to eight months. "Most of them are pro (races), and I 
don't want to get caught up in that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Outside of racing, Haslett's life style is still physically intense. She said 
she enjoys tennis, softball, snow skiing and occasionally wind surfing. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to carry on the family tradition, Haslett said she will continue 
racing motorcycles competitively and just for the fun of it for quite some 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll ride probably until I'm a grandma," she said.

U.S.-TRAINED DOCTOR AND HIS WIFE CHOSE NOT TO GO BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Dr. Jose and Nora Cueto unwittingly beat the exodus from Cuba by nearly a 
decade. Jose received a scholarship ("we were not a wealthy family, never owned 
our own home") from the University of Havana for a year's travel. He took 
advantage of it first by going to Niagara Falls on his honeymoon in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
The couple intended to return to Cuba, but Jose spent two years completing his 
surgery internship in Detroit, and Nora stayed with him. 
</P>
<P>
The last time they visited Cuba was in the winter of 1958, when they celebrated 
Christmas with their families. Jose was offered a job as director of a hospital 
there, but he didn't like the sound of the fighting in the hills. He decided 
the United States was safer. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a five-year wait to become a citizen, and citizenship is required to 
practice medicine," the Santa Ana doctor said. He remembers confronting signs 
that read "graduates of Latin American universities need not apply" when 
searching for a job. 
</P>
<P>
He was in the U.S. Navy when the Batista regime fell, and on New Year's Day, 
1959, colleagues congratulated him for the coup that brought Fidel Castro to 
power. He remembers that day as the one when he learned how to pronounce the 
word chaos in English. His response was, "Now there will be chaos!" 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Cueto says 80% of his patients are Cubans. Despite his 15-hour workdays, he 
reads the newspaper daily and writes letters to the editors. He is very 
concerned with the way Cuba is portrayed. 
</P>
<P>
News reports, he said, imply a vast improvement under Castro by noting the 
large number of Cuban physicians and engineers sent to Communist nations such 
as Nicaragua. But these physicians receive their degrees after only two years 
of education rather than the six to 10 demanded in Western nations and in 
pre-revolutionary Cuba, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Jose and Nora served as sponsors to bring people out of Cuba -- relatives, 
children of friends. His brother, Juan, emigrated via Spain and now works as an 
administrator in Jose's office. 
</P>
<P>
The Cuetos' five children were born here -- all in different states. Their two 
daughters -- Nora and Ana Maria -- married Americans. Two of their three sons 
-- Jose and Juan Antonio -- married Mexicans. Their other son, Victor, will 
marry his Mexican fiancee next month. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the majority of Cuban exiles, the Cueto family left nothing behind. "The 
only thing my family lost was fear and the demand to talk like a hypocrite!" 
Jose said.

MOTHER WHO STAYED BEHIND MAY REJOIN CHILDREN AFTER 21 YEARS 
</P>

"There are very few mothers who would send their children (away) without 
knowing whether they'd ever see them again," Mariano Sanchez said of his exodus 
to the United States from Cuba. "But I'm very grateful to my mother. For me it 
was one heck of an experience." 
</P>
<P>
Mariano, then 9, and his brother, Alejandro, then 11, left Cuba in April, 1969. 
They were sent to Madrid, Spain, with other children from their native 
Guantanamo. But once the plane landed the children split up. Mariano and 
Alejandro lived at the Casa de Campo on the outskirts of Madrid for seven 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Since the boys' aunt, Rosa Hurtado, lived in Los Angeles, they were sent to 
live with her. 
</P>
<P>
The boys' father, Fructuoso Sanchez, escaped through Guantanamo with a cousin 
and two friends in 1971. "Dad had been a coffee grower but spent 5 1/2 years in 
jail because he was accused of being a CIA agent," Mariano said. His father 
would later joke that the only seah that he knew -- pronouncing the acronym as 
if it were a word -- was Sears. 
</P>
<P>
Mariano, Alejandro and their father moved to an apartment building in Santa Ana 
that housed about 25 other Cuban families. Conversations and friendships could 
always be conducted in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, Fructuoso Sanchez opened a Chevron gas station, which he ran until it 
shut down 10 years later. For a time, the two sons worked with their father. 
Now Fructuoso Sanchez runs a Union 76 station in Westminster with Alejandro. 
"You know, it's a family kind of operation," Mariano said. 
</P>
<P>
Mariano learned the printing trade by working for three years for Lee M. Beard, 
owner of Beard Printing Co., who ran his shop out of his house across from the 
Sanchez home. After Beard died and the shop changed hands a few times, Mariano 
bought it 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
To mark the degree of his assimilation, he says, "I've had a few customers who 
couldn't tell where I was from." 
</P>
<P>
But there is no camouflaging his nationality when he wears his T-shirt that 
bears the message: "Cuba Si, Fidel No!" 
</P>
<P>
Mariano, who is divorced, now lives in Santa Ana, as does Fructuoso. Alejandro 
is a divorced father of two children, Alex Jr. and Elkis, and lives in San 
Clemente. Mariano and Alejandro's parents divorced in Cuba and she stayed 
there. After the boys left Guantanamo, Mariano didn't see his mother for 16 
years, until he returned in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Visits to Cuba are restricted by the U.S. embargo that limits travel to people 
going on family visits, official government business, news-gathering 
assignments, for educational research or as guests of a Cuban institution. 
Efforts are under way to have Teresa Losada come to live permanently in the 
United States. A letter of invitation has been sent through the State 
Department and is being reviewed at the Cuban Interests Section. 
</P>
<P>
Mariano is hopeful that the request will be processed in two weeks in Cuba, and 
then it should take another eight weeks before she is able to leave, he said. 
Mariano said he recently talked to her and she expects to arrive in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"Just talking about my mother gives me the goose bumps," he said. "It'll be 
some reunion!"

Los Angeles City Councilman Gilbert W. Lindsay collapsed in the City Hall 
garage this morning just hours before he was to greet Nelson Mandela in what an 
aide attributed to heat exhaustion and "excitement over meeting" the South 
African civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay, 89, who suffered a mild stroke in 1988, was said to be alert and in 
stable condition at White Memorial Medical Center downtown, where he was 
undergoing tests. 
</P>
<P>
He was being kept in intensive care as a precaution, but was "barking orders, 
asking questions and looking all around," deputy Bob Gay said. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay, the city's first black councilman, was to have greeted Mandela as he 
walked up a red carpet toward City Hall during the Los Angeles leg of his 
cross-country tour.

LITHUANIANS PLACE FREEZE ON FREEDOM;

<P>
MOVE COULD BRING END TO KREMLIN'S ECONOMIC BLOCKADE

<TEXT>
<P>
The Lithuanian Parliament agreed today to put a 100-day freeze on its 
declaration of independence in return for an end to the Kremlin's economic 
blockade and the start of negotiations on secession. 
</P>
<P>
The move could end the breakaway Baltic republic's 3 1/2-month-old standoff 
with Moscow over its drive toward independence. 
</P>
<P>
If the agreement is approved by Moscow, it would resolve one of the most 
contentious regional disputes facing President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as he 
prepares for a key national Communist Party congress Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution accepting a proposed compromise was approved by a vote of 69 to 
35, with two abstentions. 
</P>
<P>
It called for the 100-day moratorium to begin simultaneously with the start of 
negotiations with the Soviet government. 
</P>
<P>
The deal was worked out at two meetings between Gorbachev and Lithuanian 
President Vytautas Landsbergis this week, according to Lithuanian officials. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no immediate comment from Soviet authorities on whether the 
Lithuanian vote would be sufficient to end the embargo and start talks. 
</P>
<P>
It also was not clear when those negotiations could begin, because Gorbachev 
was expected to be tied up with the national party congress, where his reform 
effort is expected to be attacked by hard-liners. 
</P>
<P>
"We had hoped that it would end today," Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, 
who also had backed the compromise, said of the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
The move by the Parliament came hours after Landsbergis reversed his position 
and endorsed the compromise plan on the March 11 declaration.

President Hashemi Rafsanjani said today that Iran should be thankful for 
foreign aid for earthquake victims, defending the help against hard-liners who 
oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, speaking a weekly prayers at Tehran University, cited an editorial 
in a radical newspaper last week that denounced assistance from countries like 
the United States and said people chanted "Death to America" even from under 
the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we see the people who are under the debris saying, 'No, we don't 
want foreign aid," the president said. "The response and activities of the 
foreigners were really good and acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
The anti-Western faction in the Iranian government, led by lawmaker Ali Akbar 
Mohtashemi, opposes any form of foreign assistance to the Islamic Republic in 
the wake of the devastating earthquake June 21.

He was charged with criminal impersonation and two counts of assault stemming

<P>
A few hours later, he surrendered in Little Rock and was charged with 
second-degree assault and harassment. Police said Wyatt attempted to suck the

He was freed on personal recognizance in both cases and ordered to appear in

HUBBLE TROUBLES BLAMED ON SCRIMPING BY NASA

Sen. Albert Gore (D-Tenn.) today blamed troubles with the Hubble Space 
Telescope on NASA's appetite for grandiose projects, charging that the U.S. 
space agency had scrimped on Hubble testing to fuel future missions to Mars and 
the Moon. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that presently NASA's eyes are bigger than its stomach," said Gore, 
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee's space subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing into the problem-plagued Hubble project, Gore saluted NASA for 
feeding the American peoples' dreams with project after project designed to 
unlock the secrets of outer space. 
</P>
<P>
But he criticized the agency for its seeming inability to carry out these 
projects successfully. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as NASA starts to actually implement one of these projects . . . it 
goes back and starts taking money away from the people who have been given the 
unglamorous task of screwing the nuts and bolts and making the project sound," 
Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
But NASA chief scientist Lennard Fisk denied that his agency had scrimped on 
Hubble testing and told Gore that the space agency remains capable of carrying 
out major new missions. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, Fisk said, NASA had amply funded the Hubble project at the expense 
of other space science projects competing for the same limited funds. 
</P>
<P>
Two private contractors, meanwhile, refused to appear at Gore's hearings today, 
the senator said. 
</P>
<P>
These were Lockheed Corp., NASA's principal contractor for the overall 
telescope project, and Hughes Danbury Optical Systems Inc., a subsidiary of 
Hughes Aircraft Co. and the subcontractor that built the flawed mirror blamed 
for the Hubble's current troubles. 
</P>
<P>
Gore said he had asked his subcommittee staff to draw up subpoenas for the two 
companies but said he hopes that it will not be necessary to use them before 
the next hearing. 
</P>
<P>
NASA said earlier this week that it had found a flaw in one of the Hubble's 
mirrors that would prevent the telescope from performing at least 40% of its 
planned experiments until repairs could be made by space shuttle astronauts 
during a mission planned for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Gore noted that the flawed mirror had been made a decade ago, at about the same 
time NASA was assembling the space shuttle Challenger that later blew up on 
launch in January, 1986, killing its seven-member crew.

VA HOSPITAL INJECTS PATIENT WITH AIDS VICTIM'S BLOOD BY MISTAKE

A veterans hospital mistakenly injected the blood of an AIDS victim into 
another patient in the same ward who had the same surname. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an absolute tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
We are devastated by this," said Dr. Darwin Palmer, chief of infectious 
diseases at the Veterans Administration Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The error was discovered less than an hour after the patient, who is seriously 
ill with an undisclosed ailment, was injected Wednesday, Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
"If this patient, who is very ill, lives long enough, he will unfortunately 
have a good chance of developing the AIDS virus infection," Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital immediately notified the patient of the error and offered him 
high-dose antiviral therapy, including the drug AZT -- "the best therapy we 
have" -- in an effort to stave off any infection, Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital normally takes several precautions to prevent injection of the 
wrong patient, including checking the patient's name, identification number and 
armband and talking to the patient about the test, Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to assume they did all these things, but they didn't look closely 
enough," said Palmer, who also is a professor at the University of New Mexico 
School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The question of liability remains to be determined but it appears that several 
people were involved in the mistake, Palmer said.

President Bush promised today not to interfere in thrift regulators' 
investigation of his son Neil's involvement with a failed savings and loan in 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the thrift crisis as a key reason for his willingness to consider new 
taxes, Bush also renewed his pledge to pursue vigorously individuals guilty of 
defrauding S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
"My interest . . . is to protect the depositor, put the people that broke the 
law in jail. . . . The size of the savings and loan problem is terrible, and we 
are trying very hard to go after the criminals and to have in place rules and 
regulations so that this will never happen again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The President offered a warm personal assessment of his 34-year-old son. He 
described Neil Bush as "probably the most sensitive of the four boys, maybe the 
second most sensitive" and said he has "full confidence in the integrity and 
honor of my son -- what dad wouldn't?" 
</P>
<P>
"I will stay out of anything to do with the investigation, but this is a fine 
young man," he told reporters at a White House news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that if he's done something wrong, the system will so state. If 
he hasn't, I hope it's fair enough to say, 'Hey, the boy did nothing wrong,' " 
Bush said. " . . . The system is going to work, whether it's the President's 
son or somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
Bush also challenged "those that allege misconduct . . . to speak up and say 
what it is." 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision, which is pursuing 
administrative sanctions against the younger Bush, has so far refused to 
release its charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
Some members of the House Banking Committee have accused him of having a 
conflict of interest while serving from 1985 to 1988 as a board member of 
Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Assn. in Denver. The S&amp;L, which 
collapsed at a cost of $1 billion to taxpayers, made loans to several of his 
business partners which were not repaid.

CONGRESS FIGHT SEEN AS PRESIDENT VETOES PARENTAL LEAVE BILL 
</P>

<P>
President Bush today vetoed a bill that would guarantee workers as much as 12 
weeks unpaid leave for childbirth, adoption or family illness. 
</P>
<P>
"I strongly object . . . to the federal government mandating leave policies for 
America's employers and work force," Bush said, setting the stage for a major 
confrontation with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
In a written statement before leaving for a vacation, Bush said parental leave 
is an important benefit for employers to offer workers. However, he said, "we 
must insure that federal policies do not stifle the creation of new jobs, nor 
result in the elimination of existing jobs." 
</P>
<P>
The issue of parental leave is a politically charged one. The Republican 
sponsor of the bill that Bush vetoed, Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, has 
said it is a "bedrock family issue" that could backfire on Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
In vetoing the bill, Bush said America faces its stiffest economic competition 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
"If our nation's employers are to succeed in an increasingly complex and 
competitive global marketplace, they must have the flexibility to meet both 
this challenge and the needs of their employees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Judith Lichtman, president of the Women's Legal Defense Fund and head of a 
coalition of groups that lobbied for the bill, said: "I'm stunned by the 
cynicism that this veto reveals. President Bush doesn't care about American 
families. He really only cares about big business." 
</P>
<P>
It was Bush's 13th veto. To date, Congress has not been able to muster enough 
votes to override him. 
</P>
<P>
The bill passed comfortably in the House, although the margin fell 46 votes 
short of the two-thirds majority that would be needed to override a veto. 
</P>
<P>
Senate passage came without a recorded vote. Sponsor Christopher J. Dodd 
(D-Conn.) said he was "within two or three votes" of a two-thirds majority. 
</P>
<P>
The new legislation would require business and government employers to provide 
workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid medical leave or with leave so they could 
care for a newly born or adopted child or an ill child, parent or spouse. 
</P>
<P>
Employers would have to continue health coverage and then restore a returning 
employee to his or her previous job or an equivalent position. 
</P>
<P>
Lichtman said Bush seemed to support such family leave provisions during his 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"I held out hope he meant what he said in the campaign and he really did want 
to do something," she said.

About 30 Canadian truckers blocked a lane of truck traffic bound for the United 
States today, the second protest in five weeks over high taxes and government 
policies they say threaten their livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
The parked trucks did not impede cars from crossing the Ambassador Bridge 
between Detroit and Windsor as traffic moved freely in another northbound lane 
of Route 401. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 12 trucks parked along the Peace Bridge between Ft. Erie, 
Ont., and Buffalo, N.Y., shortly after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the truckers' call for a nationwide border protest, no other blockades 
were reported along the 4,000-mile U.S.-Canadian frontier. 
</P>
<P>
The drivers say they are losing work to U.S. truckers who pay less for fuel and 
have lower taxes and insurance costs.

TALKING HEADS ASK THEMSELVES, WHERE'S DAVID? 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
And you may ask yourself: With three-fourths of the Talking Heads teaming up 
with the Ramones and Deborah Harry on a current tour, what has happened to the 
Talking Heads? 
</P>
<P>
"You'll have to ask David," says bassist Tina Weymouth, referring to band 
leader David Byrne, who is continuing his solo "Rei Momo" tour this summer. 
"It's on ice. He's got five years planned in advance, none of which includes 
Talking Heads, as far as I know. None of us want to break it up. We had an 
emotional investment in it." 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't broken up," says keyboardist Jerry Harrison, who has just released 
his second Casual Gods album, "Walk on Water." 
</P>
<P>
"But," he adds, "until we do something, what are we? He's just very, very 
excited about what he's doing with his Brazilian tour and the album he made. 
And he wants to make another one." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Byrne, Harrison says, "I think there's room to do both (solo and group 
projects). So I was quite disappointed when I learned we weren't doing an album 
this year. But that's life." 
</P>
<P>
Still, that hasn't kept Harrison from working with Weymouth and drummer Chris 
Frantz on their side project, the Tom Tom Club, for which he has done some 
writing recently. "We really like working together. There's no use waiting 
around for the Talking Heads to do it. We'll just do it now." 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose initially there was a fear that if we did anything together without 
David, it would be less than the Talking Heads," Weymouth says. "But it seemed 
a shame to ignore each other when we really do enjoy playing together." 
</P>
<P>
The Harrison collaboration will turn up on the next Tom Tom Club album. The 
three called themselves the Shrunken Heads when they appeared at a Roy Orbison 
benefit and tribute in California earlier this year. "The other name we thought 
of was the Band With Three Heads," Harrison says. 
</P>
<P>
But they won't use any of those names on the current tour, during which the Tom 
Tom Club and Harrison will be appearing jointly and merging their bands.

Gov. Garrey E. Carruthers has rejected a writer's request that Billy the Kid be

</P>

A letter is being prepared telling Las Cruces author Opal Lee Priestley of the

Wagner-Adam said a full investigation of all facts surrounding the case would

Gov. L. Douglas Wilder says he is nothing more than friends with Patricia Kluge 
despite published reports that he spent two recent weekends with the estranged 
wife of John Kluge, the richest man in the country. 
</P>
<P>
A source at Kluges' Albemarle Farms estate told the Roanoke Times &amp; 
World-News that Patricia Kluge, 41, spent Memorial Day weekend with Wilder, who 
has been divorced for more than 10 years, at Camp Pendleton near Virginia 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The same source also said she spent a four-day weekend with him in Nantucket, 
Mass., on June 7-10. 
</P>
<P>
"We're friends," Wilder, 59, said before a speech in Hot Springs Thursday. 
"Both of the Kluges are friends and that is it." 
</P>
<P>
Patricia and John Kluge cited irreconcilable differences when they separated 
about two months ago after nine years of marriage. They have a 6-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
John Kluge, who contributed $200,000 to Wilder's successful bid to become the 
nation's first black elected governor, is listed by Forbes magazine as 
America's wealthiest man, worth an estimated $5.2 billion. As part of their 
settlement, John Kluge gave Patricia the Charlottesville mansion and the annual 
interest from $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Candace Campbell, Patricia Kluge's spokeswoman, acknowledged that "rumors are 
rampant" about the governor and her client, who has made at least one 
unannounced visit to Wilder at his office. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said Patricia Kluge considers Wilder a "close friend."

MURDER COUNT FOR PROSTITUTE?

A prostitute whose picture in Newsweek magazine led to her arrest may be 
charged with attempted murder if she has the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Kean, 36, was arrested on charges of violating her probation. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they will seek to charge her with attempted murder if a judge 
agrees to order her to have her blood tested and she turns out to be HIV 
positive. 
</P>
<P>
Kean has refused to undergo the test and told police that she does not have 
AIDS. She denied an article in the June 25 issue of Newsweek that quoted her as 
saying she still worked as a prostitute in spite of having acquired the AIDS 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
"She told me she was clean but she also told me she wasn't violating her 
parole," Police Sgt. Mike Martin said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Martin arrested Kean minutes after seeing her photograph in the magazine. He 
arrested her for violating her probation from a previous prostitution 
conviction when she got into a man's car in an area of town frequented by 
prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
The attempted murder victim would be the unidentified San Jose man who picked 
up Kean on Monday night. He was not arrested. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't tell him straight up front what the problem was," Martin said. "I 
told him to go home and look at Page 23 of this week's Newsweek."

<P>
Veteran Denver Broncos offensive lineman Keith Bishop has formally announced 
his retirement, according to Bishop's agent. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Warren, based in Denver, said Thursday that the two-time Pro Bowler plans 
to launch a career in coaching and has sent letters to the Broncos and the NFL 
informing them he is ending his playing career. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop, 33, plans to serve this fall as a graduate assistant coach at Baylor 
University, his alma mater. He has been attending classes there since February. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement marked the final development in a strange series of events 
since last season. 
</P>
<P>
After signing a five-year, $3.18-million contract in September, 1988, Bishop 
began last season as the Broncos' starting left guard. Six games into the 
season, he suffered back spasms and was replaced in the lineup by rookie Doug 
Widell. Teammates confided that Bishop was bitter about his demotion, but 
Bishop steadfastly refused to discuss the situation publicly.

Can Greg LeMond do it again? 
</P>
<P>
Last year, he made a stunning comeback on the final day to win the Tour de 
France for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
But outside demands took their toll on LeMond during the winter, and a virus 
slowed his attempts to get back into shape. 
</P>
<P>
As the 1990 race begins Saturday in a high-technology theme park called 
Futuroscope, LeMond, the only American to win the Tour de France, will be 
closely watched. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel good," LeMond said. "Things are coming around just in time. I am not 
sure I am going to be turned around 100% for the Tour, but I will be there." 
</P>
<P>
Even a less-than-100% LeMond is dangerous. He has based his whole year on 
winning this race again. 
</P>
<P>
His toughest competition could come from three other former champions -- 
Stephen Roche of Ireland, Pedro Delgado of Spain, and France's Laurent Fignon, 
a close second to LeMond last year. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond, after winning in 1986, missed the next two years while recovering from 
an accidental shooting and various illnesses and ailments. He went into the 
Tour last year as a question mark and came out a winner. 
</P>
<P>
This year's race starts with a prologue of four miles, a virtual sprint around 
the high-tech complex dotted with 360-degree movie theaters and video 
showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
For the first week, relatively flat stages give the top positions to the 
sprinters. Then come the mountains, starting July 9. 
</P>
<P>
Four days will be spent in the high mountains -- two in the Alps and two in the 
Pyrenees. 
</P>
<P>
The mountain rides start with a quick detour through Switzerland to Geneva 
before returning to France. It is a clockwise journey around France that 
stretches more than 2,125 miles.

<P>
Jennifer Capriati survived perhaps the toughest test of her young career today 
to advance to the fourth round at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati, the 14-year-old who seems to set records for youthful triumph 
whenever she steps on a court, blew five match points but rebounded from a 
second-set marathon to win the final six games and beat Robin White 7-5, 6-7, 
6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Men's second seed Boris Becker and women's third seed Monica Seles won more 
easily. Becker defeated American Dan Goldie 6-3, 6-4, 4-6, 7-5, and Seles beat 
Anne Minter of Australia 6-3, 6-3 on Centre Court. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth-seeded Zina Garrison also won in straight sets, 6-0, 6-3 over Andrea 
Leand of the United States. Leand won just 17 points on her serve and lost five 
games at love. 
</P>
<P>
Other winners on the fifth day included men's seventh seed Brad Gilbert, and 
women's 10th seed Helena Sukova and 13th seed Jana Novotna of Czechoslovakia. 
Eliminated was Derrick Rostagno, the American who knocked John McEnroe out in 
the first round. 
</P>
<P>
The day's biggest upset was turned in by a muscular young American, David 
Wheaton. He rallied from two sets down to beat 10th-seeded Jonas Svensson of 
Sweden 2-6, 6-7 (8-10), 6-1, 6-0, 6-4, and plays Gilbert next. 
</P>
<P>
Capriati's victory left the 12th seeded Floridian 4-1 in three-set matches 
since she turned pro in March, but also with some doubts mixed with 
homesickness. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking that it was good that I was able to pull that out," Capriati 
said. "But I was upset, saying, 'Why aren't you closing these matches out?' " 
</P>
<P>
Next for Capriati comes top-ranked Steffi Graf, who was playing Claudia 
Kohde-Kilsch later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
White, a 26-year-old Californian ranked 59th in the world, gave it everything 
she had but Capriati had more. She continually displayed the ability to come 
back when it seemed as if the older American with the Statue of Liberty on her 
shirt would end the Grand Slam hopes of the latest tennis whiz kid. 
</P>
<P>
In the first set, Capriati came back from 2-0 to win, breaking back in the 
eighth game and again in the 12th. She blew two break points for the set in the 
10th game. 
</P>
<P>
White started the second set with a break, too, and was up 4-1 when Capriati 
started to roll. She won four games in a row and had match points at 30-40 and 
ad-out in the 10th, but White saved both on netted backhands. She forced the 
tie-breaker on her second game point in the 12th and won the break 7-1 to even 
the match. 
</P>
<P>
White started strongly again in the final set, going up 2-0. Then came the 
pivotal game. 
</P>
<P>
Exchanging winners from the base line and net, pounding big serves and chasing 
them down, Capriati and White battled for 18 minutes, through 32 points, in 
Game 3. Capriati had five break points but lost them all on errors. White 
needed nine game points to finally take a 3-0 lead on a long backhand. 
</P>
<P>
"I shouldn't even have been down 0-3. I should have been in the locker room by 
that time," Capriati said. 
</P>
<P>
For White, it was a hollow victory. Capriati came out from the changeover 
charged up, and White had no response. 
</P>
<P>
"It took everything I had left, without a doubt," White said of the third game. 
"Even though mentally you don't think it does, because it fires you up, to be 
3-0 up, physically it does." 
</P>
<P>
Capriati held for 3-1, broke on a forehand down the line for 3-2, held for 3-3 
and broke for 4-3 on a netted volley. By now, Capriati was talking to herself: 
"Yes, I want it, I want it," as she came out from the change. 
</P>
<P>
She held for 5-3 on a backhand winner and -- after White won the first two 
points -- went up 30-40 on three errors. There was then a mini-replay of Game 
3, with Capriati three times netting service returns that would have wrapped up 
the match. Finally, after a forehand into the corner gave her a sixth chance, 
Capriati won on a backhand service return that the diving White barely touched 
as she rushed the net. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting a little homesick but I want to finish this first," Capriati said. 
"I want to see my house and see my puppy." 
</P>
<P>
Becker, trying for his fourth Wimbledon title, showed a strong serve and 
service-return against Goldie. He broke in the final games to wrap up the first 
and second sets, handed Goldie the break on a double fault in the third game of 
the third set, then completed the match by breaking the American a final time 
in the 12th game on a service-return winner and a forehand passing shot down 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, the highest-ranking American left in the men's draw, defeated Paul 
Haarhuis of the Netherlands 6-1, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2. Sukova beat Alexia Dechaume of 
France 6-4, 6-3, and Novotna defeated Jo-Anne Faull of Australia 6-2, 6-1. 
Rostagno lost to Goran Ivanisevic of Yugoslavia 6-2, 6-2, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Cash, the 1987 champion who has been up and down the rankings since, also 
reached the fourth round with a 6-1, 6-1, 6-4 victory over Juan Aguilera of 
Spain.

ART: STAN CLINE'S IMAGES DEPICT THE CITY'S LANDMARKS -- FROM ANGELS FLIGHT TO 
DODGER STADIUM -- WITH A NOSTALGIC YEARNING.

Stan Cline sells more than just art. He sells memories. 
</P>
<P>
His depictions of familiar -- and often gone -- Los Angeles landmarks such as 
Angels Flight, cruise night on Van Nuys Boulevard and the San Fernando Valley's 
old rail system evoke remembrances of good times, of growing up in a city with 
a history. 
</P>
<P>
"People buy these paintings because they relate to them as part of their past," 
Cline said at his Valley showroom at the Valley Indoor Swap Meet in Woodland 
Hills. "People have good memories of their past, and looking at these pictures 
gives them a good, happy feeling." 
</P>
<P>
One of Cline's longtime patrons is Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson, 
whose 12th District includes much of the West Valley. Bernson fell in love with 
the nostalgic look of the artist's work at a showing about 13 years ago and has 
collected five prints since. Bernson grew up in Los Angeles, and the pictures 
"are about my childhood," he said. "So much of old Los Angeles is gone." 
</P>
<P>
Prints of Angels Flight, Dodger Stadium, the Red Car, the old Lick Pier in 
Santa Monica and Los Angeles Airport, 1930, decorate the reception area of the 
councilman's downtown office, and in June, 1983, he arranged for Cline's work 
to be shown for two weeks in the City Hall Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Cline, 51, wanted an art career ever since he painted the sixth-grade mural in 
grammar school. A fourth-generation Californian and a history buff with a 
penchant for railroads, Cline made his living as an advertising artist. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, as the country wallowed in Bicentennial fever, Cline took a UCLA 
Extension class on the history of railroads and made a New Year's resolution to 
do some railroad paintings. But he was sidetracked by an old picture of Angels 
Flight, that popular funicular that used to hoist passengers up downtown's 
Bunker Hill. Researching Angels Flight, he realized how much the city had 
changed since his boyhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I've lived in Los Angeles all my life, and I realized there are so many things 
that are gone," the silver-haired artist said in his Calabasas condominium, 
gazing at the picture of Angels Flight that hangs above the fireplace. "And I 
thought, 'What else can I paint in L.A. that is gone?' " 
</P>
<P>
He haunted the California Historical Society research library on Wilshire 
Boulevard and set to work capturing old Los Angeles. But he wasn't ready to 
give up his day job until 1978, when the society asked him to do a show. 
</P>
<P>
He gathered up a baker's dozen of canvases, including Angels Flight, Broadway 
and Bunker Hill circa 1898 and Los Angeles County Courthouse. But when a woman 
asked to buy his original of Santa Monica's Ocean Park-Lick Pier, circa 1946, 
tagged at $10,000, he couldn't part with it. 
</P>
<P>
Later, as he was berating himself for stupidity, she called to ask if she could 
buy a print of that picture, an idea that had not previously occurred to him. 
She really wanted that memory -- her father was the Lick who built the pier. 
</P>
<P>
Cline wound up painting another version for her, of the pier in 1923, and with 
the proceeds started his nostalgia business. And he hasn't looked forward 
since. 
</P>
<P>
His catalogue today has grown from the original 13 to more than 120 works, some 
specifically commissioned, such as a trio sought by the RTD in 1981 to trace 
the 80-year history of transit in Los Angeles. Cline, who served on Mayor Tom 
Bradley's Committee to Bring Rapid Transit to Los Angeles, painted a variety of 
scenes, ranging from a 1925 Yellow Car at Pershing Square to a 1980s city 
skyline crisscrossed by freeways and studded with double deckers, minibuses and 
an articulated bus. 
</P>
<P>
Today, he does sell originals for $3,500, while prints, mostly lithographs, go 
for $55 to $250 depending on the size, matting and frame. "Cruise Night Van 
Nuys/Bob's Big Boy, 1971" -- a depiction of that popular Valley date-night hot 
spot -- was his hottest seller last year, with 150 copies sold. Other favorites 
include Dolores' Drive-In (where the waitresses careened on roller skates), 
Santa Monica Pier, Dodger Stadium and Angels Flight. 
</P>
<P>
Cline's work is among the most popular of the 110 artists featured at the Santa 
Monica Crafters Gallery, according to owner Maya Swamy. 
</P>
<P>
"People look at them and talk and remember," she said. "These pictures are a 
part of people's lives. They're like photographs of their childhood." 
</P>
<P>
A limited-edition Dodger series was especially popular last year because the 
original was autographed by the entire 1988 World Champion team. Like much of 
Cline's work, this one comes with a story. 
</P>
<P>
Cline had finished the paintings of Dodger Stadium the night the Boys in Blue 
won the National League pennant. When the team came to City Hall for a victory 
celebration, the artist took the original downtown, hoping to get some 
autographs. Afraid the painting would be damaged in the crush of people, Cline 
took it for safekeeping to Bernson's office. 
</P>
<P>
A sympathetic secretary took the painting to the mayor's office, where the 
entire team signed the mat board. Cline's limited edition of 70 prints, at $325 
each, sold briskly. 
</P>
<P>
High schools are another hot seller; so far he has done 13, including Van Nuys 
High and Canoga Park High in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Touring Cline's gallery at the swap meet in Woodland Hills, where he exhibits 
and sells works every weekend, there is a thrill of recognition when a customer 
spies a picture of his or her alma mater, pristine as they probably never were 
in reality. His showplace often seems more like a high school reunion than an 
art store. Strangers, gazing at the same picture, stop and share memories, 
asking, "When did you graduate? Did you know so-and-so?" 
</P>
<P>
"My God, you've got my whole life here," one woman exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Valley residents eagerly point out the Southern Pacific train 
barreling out of the Chatsworth Tunnel in 1950, the Pacific Electric trolley 
that ran down Sherman Way to Canoga Park in 1932 and the Picover Line station 
in Van Nuys (which became the Big Yellow Barn antique store and had been 
declared a historical landmark before being destroyed by fire earlier this 
month). 
</P>
<P>
There's "Hollywood-Burbank Airport, 1971," showing now defunct airlines, 
including PSA and Hughes Air West, and the Burbank Pacific Electric Station, 
1941, where today sits a carwash. 
</P>
<P>
"Having grown up in Los Angeles, I'm fascinated by these pictures because all 
these landmarks are gone," said Billee George of Hollywood, buying a picture of 
Fairfax High (Cline's alma mater) for her husband. "These are great 
memorabilia." 
</P>
<P>
Val Wilke of Woodland Hills, looking for the perfect birthday present for her 
husband, picked up Cline's "Westwood, 1951." 
</P>
<P>
"We grew up there," she explained. She went to University High, "and every day 
after school we would go to Westwood for a hamburger," Wilke said. "It's so 
much fun to see these. They're really authentic. This evokes such great 
memories." 
</P>
<P>
Detail is important in Cline's work. 
</P>
<P>
"The research is the hardest part," Cline said. Using old high school 
yearbooks, snapshots and sometimes even 8mm movies, Cline painstakingly roots 
out the minutiae of the era he wants to re-create. He visits the site, taking 
pictures and quizzing tenants and neighbors. Two bookcases at home are crammed 
with books full of pictorial reminders of Los Angeles, trolleys, trains and 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
It's the little things that date his work. For example, a portrait of La Reina 
Theatre, 1956 (now a Ventura Boulevard shopping center in Sherman Oaks), has a 
marquee advertising screenings of "Some Like It Hot" with Marilyn Monroe, and 
James Dean's "Rebel Without a Cause." 
</P>
<P>
One of his favorite ways of not only dating but personalizing a picture is to 
use cars. For about $350, Cline will paint in the auto, airplane or boat of 
your choice. 
</P>
<P>
Sally Levy of Woodland Hills bought Dolores' Drive-In for her husband because, 
"We used to go there all the time and it is a great memory." 
</P>
<P>
She had Cline paint in her husbands' old autos -- a '48 Lincoln and a blue '56 
Oldsmobile. "When he opened it, he said, 'Those are my cars.' It was great." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn McLaughlin of Simi Valley had a hard time choosing which memory to buy for 
her father. She loved the one of her own alma mater, Dorsey High, but was drawn 
to the Helms Bakery picture because her father used to work across the street. 
</P>
<P>
"And after the beach, we used to stop here," she said, pointing to the Tail o' 
the Pup at La Cienega and Beverly. 
</P>
<P>
"It all brings back memories," she said, adding with a laugh: "It also makes 
you feel old because so much of this is changed." 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in his home studio, Cline leafs through his picture catalogue as if he 
were a proud dad with a family photo album sharing anecdotes about how his 
children were born. Take the one about "Van Nuys Cruise Night." Cline was 
lunching at Bob's Big Boy with a Van Nuys police captain who was interested in 
a painting for the police academy. The captain casually mentioned that he 
helped end "cruise night" along the street. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'Ah ha!' " Cline recalled. "People love my cars. What an ideal way 
to show off the cars, by putting them at Bob's. . . . People buy it as much for 
the cars -- the '61 T-bird, the Chevys, the old Studebaker -- as for the 
restaurant." He even has two Los Angeles Police Department motorcycle cops 
painted in, keeping the peace. 
</P>
<P>
Cline said that, at first, selling at a swap meet, surrounded by lingerie on 
one side and combat boots on the other, seemed kind of seedy. But after doing 
the Westwood Art Show and weekend fairs, he liked the idea of being in 
high-traffic areas. On peak days, the swap meet gets about 3,000 visitors and 
Cline said he sells 20 to 25 pictures a weekend. "This is where my gallery is," 
he said, gesturing at the three-booth wide space, which he's decorated with 
carpeting, gallery-style walls and professional lighting. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't even seem to mind working weekends. "How can I not like being 
someplace where I'm constantly getting praise and money?" he asked. "People are 
constantly giving me input, telling me what scenes they would like to see, 
sharing memories."

LES BROWN'S BAND KEEPS SWINGING, JUST NOT SO OFTEN; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: ENGAGEMENTS ARE DOWN TO 80 A YEAR. AN UPCOMING ANNUAL GIG AT DISNEYLAND 
WILL ALLOW THE BAND 'TO BLOW OUT THE WAY WE LIKE TO BLOW OUT.'

<P>
When clarinetist-saxophonist Les Brown started his career, he wanted to be the 
next "King of Swing." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he wished this so much that he patterned his Durham, N.C.-based Duke 
Blue Devils, formed in 1935 when Brown and his crew were students at Duke 
University, after Benny Goodman's big band. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the 78-year-old Brown may be the "King of Swing" by default. "I'm the 
only one (of the original swing era bandleaders) left," he says jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the remaining big-name swing bands, from Count Basie and Duke Ellington 
to Woody Herman and Glenn Miller, continue as "ghost bands" under the 
leadership of former members. 
</P>
<P>
"Big band business is down. The ghost bands can't work year-round any more," he 
says. "(Trombonist) Buddy Morrow leads the Tommy Dorsey three or four months a 
year, the Ellington and Woody Herman bands don't work much, though 
(saxophonist) Frank Foster does all right with the Basie band, but their prices 
are down. The other bands, like Ray Anthony or (the Art Depew-led) Harry James 
(band), work only a few nights a month." 
</P>
<P>
Brown, whose new album of classic standards, "Anything Goes," is on the USA 
label, doesn't get a lot more work himself. He says he averages six or seven 
dates a month -- "about 80 a year" -- in performances from San Diego to San 
Francisco with an occasional trip to Palm Springs or Phoenix. His Band of 
Renown begins a weeklong stand at Disneyland's Carnation Plaza Gardens on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The theme park engagement is special for Brown. He played on the park's opening 
day -- July 17, 1955 -- and has performed there every year since as part of 
Disneyland's summer big band series. And while other current engagements keep 
the band active, the Carnation Plaza Gardens affords the band a chance to 
really come alive. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy the Disneyland gig more than any other we play all year because the 
band can blow," Brown says with exuberance, sitting on the back porch of his 
home in the Pacific Palisades, where ocean breezes and tall pines provide an 
idyllic ambience. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, the only time we can blow out the way we like to blow out and play 
the arrangements that we recorded and the way we recorded them, full blast, is 
at Disneyland, or an occasional concert," he adds. (Brown's old hits, like 
1945's "Sentimental Journey" and 1948's "I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm," are 
collected on the recently released, "Les Brown: The Best of the Big Bands" 
(CBS)). 
</P>
<P>
You see, Brown doesn't play in public that much. "We do maybe 10 dates a year 
for the public," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Most of Brown's engagements are for charity, political fund raisers and private 
parties. A few weeks ago, he was in San Francisco, playing a Realtors' 
convention, then he went down to West Los Angeles and a 25th-anniversary party 
for a car dealership. Each winter, Brown makes trips to Palm Springs to play a 
series of celebrity charity golf tournaments, including the Frank Sinatra 
Celebrity Invitational, the Nabisco Dinah Shore Invitational and the Bob Hope 
Chrysler Desert Classic. 
</P>
<P>
"We're big on golf tournaments," says Stumpy Brown, Brown's younger brother, 
bass trombonist since 1943 and manager since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"We've become a society band," Les Brown says, laughing. "I didn't think about 
it like that until I went to see Buddy Rich in the hospital at UCLA before he 
died and he said that to me. I said to him, 'You know, you're right.' " 
</P>
<P>
Playing black-tie occasions at $250 to $2,500 a plate calls for a subdued 
musical atmosphere, Brown says. "A lot of old bands have played these affairs 
without cutting (back their volume), and they blow 'em out of the room, so they 
don't get hired again," he says. "So I have two books, one for before and 
during dinner and the other for after dinner. After dinner, we go back to our 
stuff. But by then -- these things usually start at 7:30 and go to 11:30 -- 
almost everybody's gone home, except the few people that can dance to, or 
remember how to dance to, our style." 
</P>
<P>
Brown has had a rewarding career. Putting down the clarinet and the Goodman 
image early on, Brown adopted more of the Basie flavor that made him one of the 
most popular bands in the country. "We were never a jazz-band band, we were a 
dance band that now and then played some jazz," he says. "And we had some good 
jazz men in the band," like clarinetist Abe Most and saxman Ted Nash. (Today's 
band features tenorist Rusty Higgins, vocalist Jo Ann Greer, trombonist Andy 
Martin and trumpeter Don Rader.) 
</P>
<P>
At his peak in the '40s, Brown worked almost year-round; in the '50s, he still 
played 200 dance dates a year in addition to TV shows (Bob Hope, Dean Martin, 
Steve Allen) and tours with Hope and others. He has worked with Hope since 
1947, when he replaced Desi Arnaz as the comedian's musical director. The 
former reed soloist -- "I still play with the sax section occasionally but I 
let the younger guys do the blowing" -- cut things back drastically in the 
early '70s, when he said "enough" to his schedule of cross-country one-niters. 
</P>
<P>
After 55 years in the business, Brown still hasn't had enough. "Hell, no!" he 
all but shouts, then laughs. "I've got nothin' else to do and as long as I have 
my health, I'm not going to hang it up." 
</P>
<P>
As for the future of his business, Brown isn't so upbeat: "Let's face it. We're 
going to fade out. There won't be much demand for big bands soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Les Brown and his Band of Renown perform Sunday through July 7 at 7:15, 8:15, 
9:30 and 10:30 p.m. at Carnation Plaza, Disneyland, 1313 Harbor Blvd., Anaheim. 
Admission included with park admission: $20.50 to $25.50. Information: (714) 
999-4565.

OAKLAND TRIB'S FIGHT FOR LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLISHING: EDITOR ROBERT MAYNARD'S LATEST RESCUE EFFORT CALLS FOR A 25% STAFF 
REDUCTION. FAILURE WOULD MAKE OAKLAND THE NATION'S LARGEST CITY WITHOUT A 
NEWSPAPER OF ITS OWN.

<TEXT>
<P>
One sultry evening last week at UC Berkeley's rustic Faculty Club, Robert C. 
Maynard held captive an audience of East Bay business and civic leaders with an 
impassioned plea for grass-roots help to save his newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier that day, the Tribune had announced drastic measures, including a staff 
reduction of more than 25%, designed to pare the Oakland paper's out-of-line 
costs and stave off bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
What Maynard, who himself took a 20% pay cut, wanted from his audience was 
support in rustling up subscriptions and advertising. At stake, in his view, 
was the survival of Oakland's prime watchdog and news lifeline. 
</P>
<P>
"I know you do not want to see Oakland, California, become the largest city in 
the United States without its own newspaper," he told the group. 
</P>
<P>
Maynard, however, knows full well that it will take more than a few 
subscriptions to bail out the Tribune. Plagued by steep declines in advertising 
and readership, empty coffers, outmoded facilities and competition from other 
Bay Area newspapers, the 116-year-old daily is fighting for its life. 
</P>
<P>
Although Maynard maintains that the cutbacks will put the Tribune on firm 
financial footing, many staff members fear that the paper has begun a downward 
spiral from which it might not emerge. They wonder how they will continue to 
put out a worthy product once Maynard slices the staff to 500 from 725, on top 
of previous reductions. 
</P>
<P>
Gallows humor pervades the small, unkempt newsroom, reflected in a 
hand-lettered sign that appeared at an employee's desk Tuesday, the day workers 
were to submit routine records of work hours: "Act of Faith Day: Time Cards." 
</P>
<P>
Underscoring the situation's severity was the resignation last Friday of Paul 
R. Greenberg, a director and owner of the 21% of the company that Maynard does 
not hold. It was Greenberg, a Los Angeles lawyer, who devised the financing 
package that enabled him and Maynard to buy the Tribune from Gannett Co. in 
1983. Gannett loaned the pair most of the $22 million. With the purchase, 
Maynard became the first black owner of a major metropolitan daily. 
</P>
<P>
Greenberg quit, he said, because he considers Maynard too weak a manager and 
the company too short of funds to launch a successful resuscitation effort. 
What is needed, he said, is to find a buyer with deeper pockets and stronger 
management. But Maynard is dead set against selling. 
</P>
<P>
"I see rebuilding as the most viable option," Maynard said in an interview at 
his cluttered office in Tribune Tower in downtown Oakland. "The whole purpose 
in the restructuring is to build for the long haul." 
</P>
<P>
If Maynard, 53, sounds like a cockeyed optimist in the face of harsh realities, 
perhaps he can be forgiven. He has for years defied skeptics who gave the 
Tribune up for lost when he bought it. 
</P>
<P>
That was four years after he was brought on board by Gannett as editor, the 
first black to head newsroom operations at a metro daily. Exuberant and 
charismatic, he had by then established himself as an advocate for minority 
journalism. 
</P>
<P>
The Brooklyn-born son of immigrants from Barbados, Maynard in the 1960s became 
White House correspondent for the Washington Post at a time when blacks were 
rarely hired by mainstream newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, he left the Post and, with his wife, Nancy Hicks Maynard, a former New 
York Times reporter, co-founded the Institute for Journalism Education in 
Berkeley, a minority training organization. 
</P>
<P>
As editor of the Tribune, he used Gannett's plentiful resources to increase 
news space, sharpen coverage and build staff, especially minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came here with Gannett, there were only two or three minorities on the 
staff," he recalled. "That's where the building of a paper that reflected this 
city began." 
</P>
<P>
In recruiting young blacks, Maynard sold the idea of working at the Trib as a 
"chance to be on the ground floor" of something important, said Lonnie Isabel, 
whom Maynard hired away from the Boston Globe. 
</P>
<P>
Many called it "following the Maynard vision," said Isabel, who moved to 
Newsday last August as assistant national editor after 8 1/2 years as a writer 
and editor at the Tribune. (Although many such experienced minorities have been 
lured away, Maynard said minorities still make up 20% to 25% of the staff.) 
</P>
<P>
As owner, without Gannett's funds, Maynard had to adapt to a hand-to-mouth 
approach. He immediately won $10 million in concessions from unions, in the 
process shifting from compatriot to adversary. 
</P>
<P>
To attract readers, the newspaper launched a variety of zoning efforts -- often 
unsuccessful -- to reach into ever-distant suburbs in Contra Costa County, many 
of them affluent and white and unafflicted by the kinds of urban problems 
common to Oakland. Millions of dollars were spent opening satellite offices and 
shuffling people around. Some staff members became disillusioned, contending 
that Maynard was a better guru than businessman and that he let circulation and 
advertising needs dictate coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"We were tough on the city administration in Oakland and very tough on the 
school board (but) kissed up to the suburbs," one former reporter said. "Once 
we had a story about a pancake breakfast in Montclair (an affluent section of 
the Oakland Hills) on the front page of the paper. It turned people off." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Maynard had to deal with a personal crisis: prostate cancer. 
He said he has been in remission for nearly three years. 
</P>
<P>
Maynard, bearded and somewhat portly, points with pride to the paper's 
achievements. A series on patronage in the school system prompted important 
reforms. In April, the paper won a Pulitzer Prize for photo coverage of 
October's Bay Area Quake. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the quake also hastened the latest cutbacks. The tremor put out of 
commission many of the Tribune's regular advertisers, notably the Emporium 
Capwell department store and other merchants that depended on Emporium to draw 
customers. (The Tribune building also was hit; it still shows cracks from the 
quake, and Maynard said repairs so far have cost $250,000.) 
</P>
<P>
The quake also delayed the long-awaited downtown Oakland renaissance on which 
the Tribune has pinned many of its projections. 
</P>
<P>
Advertising revenues are now 10%, or between $3 million and $4 million, below 
pre-quake levels, an erosion that Maynard calls a "catastrophe." And 
circulation has more or less steadily declined to about 130,000. 
</P>
<P>
Key to the survival plan -- which is being headed up by Mrs. Maynard, the 
company's senior vice president of marketing -- will be the response from the 
six unions with which management must negotiate cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Golds, the Tribune's wire editor and vice chairman of the newspaper's 
unit of the Northern California Newspaper Guild, noted that union 
representatives are attending a convention in New York this week, putting on 
hold negotiations over proposals to reduce staffing. 
</P>
<P>
Although some industry observers say the unions remain bitter and antagonistic 
after years of making concessions, Golds said they intend to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand the company does have financial difficulties," he said, "and we 
want to help them in every way possible to keep the company running." 
</P>
<P>
A 23-year veteran of the paper, Golds, 58, has weathered four ownerships and 
frequent layoffs and cutbacks. For the first time, he said, he is considering 
taking the company up on its offer of an early retirement buyout. 
</P>
<P>
The staff, he said, is "glum." As one employee put it, "We're all looking for 
jobs." 
</P>
<P>
Maynard says the pessimism is understandable. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take another year or so . . . for people to get used to the idea that 
the Tribune can be a profitable and economically healthy organization," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
What must happen first, he realizes, is a scaling back of the once lofty goal 
of rivaling the San Francisco dailies. Instead of "trying to be all things to 
all people," the paper will now concentrate on the corridor of towns stretching 
from the Carquinez Strait on the north to Fremont on the south, forgoing 
coverage of Contra Costa County suburbs further inland. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've had to do here is be very humble," Maynard said. "It's a challenge 
to our creative intelligence to find a way to live within our means." 
</P>
<P>
Gannett Co. acknowledges that Maynard so far has paid none of the substantial 
interest on its loan, which has a principal amount of $17 million. But an 
executive maintains that the media company, based in Arlington, Va., has no 
intention of calling the loan, at least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
"Bob is a friend," said Douglas H. McCorkindale, vice chairman. "We're not 
going to do anything that would put the Oakland Tribune in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Goldstein, dean of Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism, agreed that 
the Tribune has "got a tricky struggle." But he refuses to count Maynard out. 
"He has been able to keep it afloat when many had written it off."

TORO TAKES HIS FINAL RIDE TONIGHT

<P>
Fernando Toro has no trouble remembering his first mount. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 15 years old and I didn't know what I was doing," he said. "I'd 
exercised a lot of horses in the morning, but that was all. I was the little 
guy and all the older riders were giving me a lot of advice, do this and don't 
do that." 
</P>
<P>
Competing at the Hippodromo in Santiago, Chile, the nervous teen-ager finished 
third. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four years and more than 27,600 mounts later, Toro is likely to be 
battling his nerves again tonight. 
</P>
<P>
The Bull will ride for the last time in Hollywood Park's seventh race, 
concluding a career during which he has won 3,572 races and more than $56.4 
million in purses. 
</P>
<P>
Fittingly, Toro will wrap things up on the turf, riding Exclusive Partner, a 
veteran himself at age 8, over a course on which the jockey has enjoyed many of 
his finest hours. The event is the $83,300 Fiesta Handicap, written 
specifically for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
A Southern California regular since 1970, Toro decided near the end of the 
Santa Anita meeting to retire. He returned to his native Chile, rode a few 
races there, picking up a victory -- in late April. 
</P>
<P>
He hasn't ridden competitively since, although he has been working and 
galloping horses for trainer Richard Mandella for the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked Fernando a mile this week and he blew a bit coming back," said 
Mandella, a longtime friend whom Toro will be assisting when he retires before, 
eventually, going out on his own as a trainer. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope he's fit enough to win and they won't test him after the race." 
</P>
<P>
Exclusive Partner and Toro have always been a good match. They teamed for an 
allowance victory March 1 at Santa Anita and last year scored victories in the 
Gold Cup Handicap in Louisiana and Keeneland's Elkhorn Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Mr. Mandella will have the horse ready," Toro said. "I hope he runs 
well. If he wins. . . . well, that would be something." 
</P>
<P>
A victory in his farewell appearance would certainly become another highlight 
in a professional life that includes winning an unprecedented 40 turf races 
during the 1976 Hollywood Park meeting, winning the first Breeders' Cup grass 
event aboard Royal Heroine in the 1984 Mile, and winning the 1986 Arlington 
Million on Estrapade. 
</P>
<P>
Not hesitant to call Royal Heroine the best horse he has ever ridden, Toro 
recalls the week before the first Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought (trainer) John Gosden did a wonderful job with her," he said. "She 
had all kinds of problems. It was always something -- knees, ankles, feet. It 
was unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
"There was concern the whole week she wasn't going to be able to make it. One 
day, she was going to run and the next day, she wasn't. The day before the 
race, she wasn't going to run. Then, Saturday morning, John said she was. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got to the jockey's room that day, I kept thinking I was going to get a 
call that she had been scratched. She ran a super race. That, and the (1984) 
Arlington Million where she finished second to John Henry were the best races 
she ever ran." 
</P>
<P>
Two years later, Estrapade carried Toro to success in Arlington Park's biggest 
race on the way to an Eclipse Award. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember having an inside post position and being concerned about not 
getting trapped down inside," he said. "At the 5 1/2 (-furlong) pole, I went 
from fifth to the lead. I saw the opening and went for it and didn't think 
twice about it. 
</P>
<P>
"At the five-eighths pole, I was two in front. At the half-mile pole, I was 
three in front. That's when I thought, 'Oh . . ., I moved too soon.' But, she 
proved me wrong. That was the right move. She was a very good mare." 
</P>
<P>
Fans might have trouble remembering thoroughbreds Ginger Brink and Shameen but 
races he won with each stand out in Toro's memory. 
</P>
<P>
"(Trainer Ted) West told me before the race (the second division of the 1983 
Hollywood Derby) that (Ginger Brink) had ability, but he had to be taken back. 
</P>
<P>
"At the head of the stretch, I was still last with him, but we were able to 
make it. When I came back, Mr. West said, 'I told you to take him back, but you 
made me real nervous.' 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember the date, but I was riding Shameen in a mile-and-a-sixteenth 
allowance race on the grass at Hollywood Park. It was a 12-horse field and we 
were last at the quarter pole. There were 11 horses in front of me, but I was 
able to get through inside all of them in about a sixteenth of a mile." 
</P>
<P>
Although he obviously enjoys reminiscing, Toro isn't having any second thoughts 
about retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be very hard for my family (wife Lola, three daughters and two sons) 
to accept a change," he said. "I couldn't do anything different because they're 
so happy. I'm comfortable it was the right decision. I'm 49, I've been doing 
this for 34 years and, although I've had accidents, there hasn't been anything 
which is going to affect me for the rest of my life. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to miss everything involved with riding. I still enjoy it very much 
and it's always been a lot of fun, but I feel like I'm going to settle into my 
new life pretty easily. I'm not going to be bored. This will be the first 
summer I'll have a vacation with my family. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never considered myself a great rider. I was just doing my business the 
best way I could." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Kilroe, whose participation has been limited at Santa Anita since he 
suffered a stroke in April, 1989, has retired. A longtime force in Southern 
California racing, Kilroe has in recent years served as director of racing for 
Oak Tree and senior vice president/racing for the Los Angeles Turf Club. Tom 
Robbins succeeds Kilroe as director of racing for Oak Tree and Santa Anita and 
he has also been elected a vice president of the LATC. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park's ceremony honoring Fernando Toro tonight will be after the 
fifth race. . . . Michelle Dollase, wife of jockey Corey Nakatani and the 
daughter of trainer Wallace Dollase, gave birth to 7-pound 8-ounce Brittany 
Marie Wednesday night.
