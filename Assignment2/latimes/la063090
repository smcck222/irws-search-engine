NEIL BUSH'S ROLE IN FAILED COLORADO S&amp;L 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For those who like a dash of irony in their daily news diet the June 21 Times 
carries a double ration. First, the editorial about Neil Bush, who used his 
privileged position to have his bank lend funds to business associates, deals 
that benefited him financially, loans that were not properly secured. For this 
caper Neil was slapped on the wrist by the government Office of Thrift 
Supervision, banned from the banking industry because he had "engaged in 
personal dishonesty," and had "willfully breached his fiduciary duties." And, 
of course, he is appealing that judgment. 
</P>
<P>
Contrast this with the same day report on Anthony Essex, a Los Angeles black 
bank executive, who, horrors, "exaggerated his income" to obtain a home loan of 
$121,500. He was booked for this crime on eight fraud charges. He will have to 
pay the bank $63,000, spend six months in jail, serve 640 hours of community 
service and be on five years probation when he leaves jail. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Essex had the wrong father. Meanwhile and more glaringly, George 
("kinder, gentler") Bush announces part of his plan to meet the current rising 
deficit is "by relying heavily on reductions in Medicare and other health 
benefits." The President balanced his announcement by "denouncing angrily a 
House subcommittee's refusal to fully fund his space exploration initiative and 
declared the American people want us in space." He went on to "challenge those 
who would tackle the nation's social ills before proceeding with a renewed 
exploration of the heavens." 
</P>
<P>
I wonder which sector of the "American people" Bush is talking about? If he 
were to conduct a poll tomorrow stating that given an option of voting $10 
billion (an arbitrary figure) to explore Mars or spending that same amount of 
money to help feed our homeless, provide more treatment centers for alcoholics 
and other dopers, leave our Medicare budget untouched and provide better care 
for our indigent elders, I am certain that the voters, cynical, befuddled and 
uncaring as they often seem to be, would overwhelmingly choose the second 
option. 
</P>
<P>
What is the point of solving the problem of putting even a regiment of space 
travelers on Mars when our own domestic problems, typified by violence and dope 
dealing and illiteracy, are unsolved? 
</P>
<P>
I do not expect an answer. Just asking.

IMPEDIMENTS? NO PROBLEM ; 
</P>
<P>
TRICKY TOKYO-WASHINGTON TRADE PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The proposed trade agreement between Japan and the United States will be a 
stunning success if it helps reduce the $49-billion trade imbalance between the 
two nations. But a future healthy relationship between the two economic giants 
dictates that the political will to make the agreement work must be found 
first. 
</P>
<P>
That's the hard part. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it took the personal intervention by phone of President George Bush and 
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu before four days of marathon trade talks 
yielded the unusual trade pact. The agreement, concluded after a year of 
contentious negotiations, calls for the United States to take stronger action 
to reduce its federal budget deficit, increase savings, promote exports, 
improve education and encourage competition. In turn, Japan agreed to increase 
its public works spending sharply to $2.7 trillion over the next 10 years, 
simplify its import process and strengthen its anti-monopoly laws. 
</P>
<P>
The two nations have finally conceded to bilateral commitments that could have 
profound effects on their domestic policies. Given political realities, 
initiating fundamental changes in the economic, legal and social structures of 
each nation is necessary, but difficult. 
</P>
<P>
So it's no surprise that some skepticism has greeted the first full agreement 
under the so-called Structural Impediments Initiative, the Administration's 
mechanism to address touchy U.S.-Japan trade relations in order to shield it 
from a protectionist backlash in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts question the validity of economic assumptions behind this pact; 
others doubt that Bush and Kaifu and their respective governments will mount 
the politically unpopular domestic political offensives needed to meld their 
international agendas. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps not coincidentally, Bush's big turnabout on his campaign pledge of no 
new taxes came during an impasse in the SII talks. The next day, Japanese trade 
negotiators agreed to raise Japan's public works spending, citing the 
President's willingness to increase U.S. tax revenues to tackle the budget 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's careful nurturing of telephone diplomacy with Kaifu has helped the prime 
minister politically. He comes from a weak faction of the Liberal Democratic 
Party, the ruling party of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The LDP, as well as all of Japan, is groping for a new vision for the 1990s. In 
the past, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry has painted pictures 
of 10-year cycles of economic and industry-specific development. Its latest 
preliminary policy report, though vague in parts, pointedly encourages consumer 
spending. That means at least they're listening. 
</P>
<P>
What happens now? 
</P>
<P>
Bush has to curb spending, Kaifu has to increase it. Their agendas are no 
longer mutually exclusive. In fact, they will be assessed by the same 
yardstick: a decline in the U.S.-Japan trade imbalance.

MORE AMMO FOR GUN EDUCATION; 
</P>
<P>
A 13-YEAR-OLD DIES IN LA PALMA; GUN BILL DIES IN SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This week in La Palma, a 13-year-old boy was accidently shot by a 12-year-old 
friend he was visiting, and later died. Police said there had been a rule in 
the house that the handgun must be kept unloaded. But as one officer observed, 
"Somebody loaded it. It didn't load itself." 
</P>
<P>
How an unloaded gun gets loaded and into the hands of an adolescent is a bitter 
mystery in a long-running national tragedy. If all the allegedly "disarmed" and 
"safely stored" guns were as advertised, the world would be a safer place for 
youngsters like Adam LaFortune, the victim. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the need for basic education on the safe storage and handling of 
firearms, a sensible effort to require new handgun owners to complete a safety 
training course faltered last month when Gov. George Deukmejian sent a puzzling 
veto message to the Legislature. For the evident benefit of gun-control people, 
the governor noted in his veto message that, " . . . if you pay $17 and sit in 
a class without paying any attention or learning anything, you are still given 
a certificate . . . ." And he worried that the lack of a nearby course might 
somehow prove inconvenient, and "a barrier to the purchase of a handgun." 
</P>
<P>
The vetoed legislation, sponsored by Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos), 
would not by any means have been a cure-all. 
</P>
<P>
There is no course in the world that can give people the minimum common sense 
needed to keep a handgun unloaded. No Ph.D is required to understand that guns 
must be kept totally out of the reach of children. 
</P>
<P>
But at least the proposed law could have ensured that there was some safety 
training for purchasers of handguns. For a gun, like an automobile, is a 
potential killer; the state has the right to require education and licensing. 
Now the fate of passage awaits a new administration -- perhaps one not inclined 
to veto it. Yet so far neither gubernatorial candidate has declared his or her 
position on this bill.

HUBBLE: LIKE A SHOT IN THE DARK; 
</P>
<P>
TROUBLED SPACE AGENCY SENDS UP AN UNTESTED TELESCOPE, LOSES BIG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration obviously has serious 
internal management problems. There was nothing wrong with the Hubble Space 
Telescope project that a measure of properly organized pre-launch testing 
couldn't have caught and fixed. 
</P>
<P>
But because basic testing of the orbiting telescope's two mirrors was not done, 
the world now sees the inglorious result of NASA's laxity and ineptitude: A 
$1.5-billion piece of equipment that, until a defect with one of its mirrors is 
fixed, is not much more than a hunk of orbiting junk. How was this fiasco 
allowed to happen? 
</P>
<P>
Lew Allen, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, has been 
asked fo find out. And Congress, with a hearing already started, will want to 
find out for itself. Inevitably the manufacturer -- Hughes Danbury Optical 
Systems, Inc. -- will be questioned about producing a couple of 
multimillion-dollar mirrors that did not work. 
</P>
<P>
Congress would be wrong to spare the rod on the manufacturer, if the facts 
uncover a design flaw or manufacturer's blunder. But in truth the job of the 
space agency is to monitor such work and prevent fiascoes. 
</P>
<P>
This one is a real beaut. NASA's huge budget ($10.9 billion in 1989) now needs 
to be reviewed; its penchant for selling Congress and the American people on 
unbelievably expensive projects called to account. Over the next 25 years NASA 
would like to operate six huge earth-observation satellites. That ambition now 
needs to be examined by Congress with a skeptical eye. Just Thursday the 
shuttle fleet was grounded, once again, after NASA detected mysterious fuel 
leaks on two of the three crafts. 
</P>
<P>
Many warned that the 1986 Challenger disaster, caused by a fuel leak that 
claimed the lives of six astronauts, showed a fundamental defect in the 
management structure and competence of the space agency. Four years later there 
is reason to ask if that warning was understated.

EXODUS OF SOVIET JEWS TO ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As co-chairman of Operation Exodus for Los Angeles, a worldwide effort to 
rescue Soviet Jews, I joined a small group in Moscow earlier this month to try 
and gain some understanding of the current status of Jews in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
As we boarded our van for the ride from the Moscow airport to our hotel, I 
asked the Intourist guide "How is life under perestroika?" From my two previous 
visits to the Soviet Union I expected to hear the usual canned public relations 
response. Instead she exploded, "It's terrible here. You stand in lines 
forever, there is nothing to buy anyway, the states are in revolt, and the 
people everywhere are frustrated and angry. This is an awful place to live!" 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow we spoke with dozens of Jews who were part of that daily mob 
besieging the Dutch embassy where the Israeli Legation issues exit visas. One 
after the other they spoke of the harshness of their life -- of the menace of 
increasing anti-Semitism and the specter of a complete breakdown of the Soviet 
system with the unspeakable terror that such chaos could create. Unfortunately, 
there is much in Russian history to justify these fears. 
</P>
<P>
Jews are leaving the Soviet Union at the rate of 10,000 per month, the pace is 
accelerating, and hundreds of thousands more are clamoring to escape while the 
doors to freedom remain open. Whatever the murky future, present policies allow 
a relatively free emigration, and Soviet Jews are flocking to Moscow to secure 
exit visas. They come from all points in that vast country. Some had traveled 
thousands of miles to join that milling crowd, each with his unique story. Some 
experienced overt anti-Semitism; some felt the overhanging menace of their 
chaotic society; others want to live and raise their children in their Jewish 
homeland; others crave a place of freedom and opportunity. This vast Exodus is 
creating a moment in the history of the Jewish people comparable to the 
biblical exodus from Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on that street in Moscow in the middle of this tense, high energy 
crowd, sensing the historical significance of what was happening, I felt a 
stream of varying emotions. Watching those Soviet Jews waving their letters of 
invitation from the Israeli government, pressing against the gates to reach 
those Israelis processing the entry visas, literally begging for the right to 
leave their homes for the unknown. To me this was an overpowering moment. 
</P>
<P>
I felt their anguish on leaving behind whatever parts of their lives that had 
been rich; I sensed their fear in going to a new land where they must learn the 
language and where they know conditions of employment, housing and all elements 
of life will be very difficult. I was filled with pride in Israel's willingness 
with open arms to accept these people as family and to generously help them 
integrate into Israel life. I felt joy and commitment being an American Jew and 
through Operation Exodus being able to participate in the vast expense of 
transportation and helping defray a small part of the Israeli government's cost 
to absorb what could be 1 million new citizens, and finally, a great 
thankfulness to be a citizen of the United States with a life of security and 
opportunity that we all, Jew and Gentile alike, take so much for granted.

MANDATORY SAVING WATER RESTRICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is somewhat discouraging to read The Times' continuing and uncritical 
endorsement of Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's call for mandatory water 
conservation (editorial, "Water Conservation: For Farmers . . . And for All 
Angelenos, As Well," June 25). Is no one taking the time to try to think 
through our alleged "water shortage" situation? Spend a few moments to reflect 
about the nature of our situation, and two facts should become apparent. 
</P>
<P>
One, it is impossible to waste water. "Water conservation" is a misnomer. 
Unlike other finite resources (oil, natural gas, and coal), water cannot be 
destroyed. Every drop we use is eventually recycled through our sewers, 
aquifers, wells, streams, lakes, oceans, and atmosphere. It is all returned to 
us for our use over and over again. We may pollute it, poison it, or purify it 
-- but we can never destroy it. 
</P>
<P>
Two, therefore, every drop of water we "conserve" is not really saved: It is 
diverted for some other purpose. By using less water, all we are doing is 
encouraging the politicians, developers and land speculators to squeeze in even 
more people in this fragile coastal desert we have already overpopulated. The 
problem is not too little water: The problem is too many people. 
</P>
<P>
By "conserving" our dwindling water supplies, we are only postponing the 
inevitable day when we have to face the fact that we cannot continue to grow 
forever. Someday we must accept the fact that our political planning process 
has been a cruel deception for decades.

I was amazed to read the article "2013: Odyssey in the Desert" (June 18) in 
that here are women performing and encouraging the kind of planting that is 
done in the Midwest when they live in the desert community of Ridgecrest. What 
amazed me even more was that you printed the article from an aspect of 
reporting a job well done, when what really needs to be said is that these 
women are uninformed about the drought the state is suffering. 
</P>
<P>
You have printed any number of articles in recent years and months about the 
state of emergency existing in California with our extreme shortage of 
rain/snowfall, and reported that, even though the sprawling metropolis of Los 
Angeles is only considering a 10% rationing of water in the upcoming year, 
communities such as Santa Barbara are undergoing severe rationing. 
</P>
<P>
I think responsible reporting would be to point out that these Desert Planters 
of Ridgecrest haven't yet got the message that we are in trouble in this state 
and, instead of planting all the "gardens, trees and manicured lawns" that they 
are, they should be installing rock and cactus gardens and using real 
California ingenuity!

MANDATORY SAVING WATER RESTRICTIONS

California farmers are among the most efficient users of water in the country, 
despite accusations by The Times and others. Two recent independent studies 
each showed that overall Central Valley agriculture is 99% efficient in its use 
of water. An acre of homes consumes about the same amount of water as the 
average acre of farmland. And farmers are not the end users of this water. It 
takes over 1.5 million gallons of water to grow the food for one person for one 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Comparing agricultural and urban water costs is misleading. Agriculture water 
costs less for several reasons. One important reason is that farm water is not 
chemically treated as is urban water. For every tax dollar that goes into 
providing agriculture with water, the government gets back two. That's an 
investment, not a subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
You misrepresented the facts about the water reclamation law. There are nearly 
20,000 family farming companies that legally participate in the water 
reclamation project, while The Times points to only a handful of abuses. A 
study by the General Accounting Office reports that Western farmers are 
complying with the law. 
</P>
<P>
Central Valley farmers have paid for their federal water several times over. 
Tax revenues generated by the water projects have amounted to $45 billion over 
the last five decades, while the investment has been only $9.5 billion over the 
last eight decades. According to the U.S. Bureau of Census, the average 
California farm size is 369 acres. Roughly half of these California farms have 
sales of $10,000 or less. Of those with sales of more than $10,000, over 80% 
consist of fewer than 500 acres. 
</P>
<P>
Misinformation, such as spread by The Times, if repeated often and left 
unchallenged, becomes institutionalized as "fact." It is time we set the record 
straight.

he was the reason we tuned in to the 10 p.m. news.

AT LEAST THE PRICES ARE FIT FOR A KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a season-ticket holder for the Los Angeles Kings, I begin preparing myself 
for yet another ticket price increase in April, just about the time the Kings 
are eliminated from the playoffs. And every year, no matter how well I prepare 
myself, I get the shock of my life when the bill arrives. 
</P>
<P>
This year was no exception. 
</P>

When I first bought my season seats in 1986, I paid $1,659 (parking included) 
for a pair in the loge. This year, those same seats will cost me $4,032, an 
increase of 243% for a team that has never been remotely close to winning a 
Stanley Cup in a town that is hardly a haven for hockey. 
</P>
<P>
I just wonder what Bruce McNall's response will be when Wayne Gretzky is gone, 
the Kings continue to flounder in fourth place and still have not come close to 
winning a Stanley Cup, the Johnny-come-lately fan no longer buys tickets and 
the longtime fan can't afford it. What will you do then, Bruce?

TREVINO LIKES THE LEAD, HATES BOGEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Lee Trevino retained the lead with a record-breaking score but acted like a man 
who had lost the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah, I like the lead. I like being in front. I'm a good front-runner. I 
always want the lead," Trevino said Friday after a 68 in the second round of 
the U.S. Senior Open at Paramus, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
With a 135 total, nine under par on the Ridgewood Country Club course and by 
two strokes the best in U.S. Senior Open history, he was one in front of the 
field at the tournament halfway point. 
</P>
<P>
And he was fuming. "My chili is hot," he said. "I'm mad as hell." 
</P>
<P>
The anger was self-directed. It involved a bogey on the par-5 17th hole. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no excuse for making bogey on a par-5 hole," he said. "Never. No 
excuse. 
</P>
<P>
"I can go out there and par the hole with a wedge. I'll bet on it. I had a 
whole set of clubs to play with and I can't make par. Damn, but I'm still hot 
about it," he said an hour after his early finish. 
</P>
<P>
While the lapse was far from fatal, it was infuriating. And it opened the door 
to a number of challengers. Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player are among them. 
Arnold Palmer is not. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Dent overcame a double-bogey on the first hole, battled back to a 68 and 
was one stroke off the lead at 136. 
</P>
<P>
Player, the current PGA Senior champion and a two-time winner of this title, 
birdied the first seven holes and went on to a 65, the best round of the 
tournament and 10 better than his 75 in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
He was tied with Nicklaus at 140, five shots off the pace. Nicklaus, winner of 
two of three previous starts on the senior circuit, improved to a bogey-free 
69. 
</P>
<P>
Palmer, 60, struggled to a 80 and, at 154, missed the cut. 
</P>
<P>
Cathy Johnston continued to lead a par-breaking barrage and held a one-stroke 
lead over Patti Rizzo after two rounds of the du Maurier Classic at Kitchener, 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Johnston, who shot a 65 on Thursday at the Westmount Golf and Country Club, 
followed with a 70 to finish 36 holes at 135, 11-under. 
</P>
<P>
Rizzo was just one back after a 69 over the 6,415-yard course, hosting the 
second of the four major tournaments on the LPGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Players were coming out of the middle of the pack to hit the leaderboard with 
eye-opening rounds, including a seven-under 66 by Beth Daniel. Fifty golfers 
were at even-par 146 or lower. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Johnston had trouble convincing her mother of Thursday's score. 
</P>
<P>
"I called my mom and she said I was lying," Johnston said, laughing. "She 
couldn't believe it. It took me about four times trying to convince her before 
she believed me." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Eastwood, looking to end a five-year winless drought, found his putting 
touch in shooting a 64 and took a one-stroke lead in the Greater Hartford Open. 
</P>
<P>
Eastwood one-putted nine greens, including three of the last four, in 
completing 36 holes at nine-under-par 131. 
</P>
<P>
First-round leader Chris Perry, with a 69, and Steve Jones, who shot 68, are 
among five tied at 132. 
</P>
<P>
John Cook, who had six consecutive birdies, missed tying Mac O'Grady's course 
record of 62 when he bogeyed the 18th hole.

POWELL (28-5) MAKES JUMP TOWARD THE TOP

VILLENEUVE DAS, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Powell soared 28 feet 5 inches to become the fifth-best long-jump 
performer of all time, and Leroy Burrell ran to a 1990 world best of 9.96 
seconds in the 100-meter dash Friday night, highlighting the BNP Grand Prix 
track meet. 
</P>
<P>
Two-time Olympic champion Roger Kingdom was beaten by Tony Dees in the 
110-meter high hurdles. Dees clocked 13.24, Kingdom 13.29. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Foster, coming off a three-month drug suspension, was third in 13.36. 
</P>
<P>
In the long jump, Powell trails Bob Beamon, the world record-holder at 29-2 
1/2, Soviet Robert Emmian (29-1), Carl Lewis (28-10 1/4), and Larry Myricks 
(28-8 1/4), although Lewis and Myricks both have several marks better than 
Powell's. 
</P>
<P>
Powell, who had a previous best of 27-10 1/4, jumped 27-4 3/4 and 27-6 on his 
two earlier attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Emmian was second Friday at 26-11 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Burrell overcame France's Daniel Sangouma midway through the race and raised 
his hand in victory over the final five meters. Still, Burrell's time was only 
.04 of a second off the world record of 9.92 held by Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
Burrell had the previous 1990 best of 10.01. He ran 9.94 last year and a 
wind-aided 9.94 this year. 
</P>
<P>
Sangouma, whose start was suspect when he jumped ahead of Burrell so quickly, 
was timed in 10.02, a French record. 
</P>
<P>
"Sangouma was well ahead of me (at the start)," Burrell said. "But rather than 
worry about that, I said I'm going to catch him. That's exactly what happened. 
And I was so happy, I put my hand up." 
</P>
<P>
France's Monique Ewanje-Epee won the women's 100-meter high hurdles in 12.56 
for a 1990 world best and a French record. 
</P>
<P>
Romanian Dointe Melinte won the women's 1,500 meters in 3:58.69, another 
season's best. 
</P>
<P>
Another women's 1990 best was bettered when Merlene Ottey of Jamaica won the 
200 in 21.97. She had run 22.12 earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's 200, Michael Johnson of the United States, making his European 
debut, won in 20.01. Johnson ran a season's best of 19.90 at the U.S. 
championships this month. 
</P>
<P>
In other events, Americans won the men's 1,500 meters and women's 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Falcon rallied in the stretch to take the 1,500 in 3:36.60, and PattiSue 
Plummer outdueled women's world cross-country champion Lynn Jennings in the 
3,000, 8:44.00 to 8:46.08. 
</P>
<P>
Of his hurdles victory, Dees said he can run faster. "I was pressing at the 
end," he said. "I should have never let Roger get that close." 
</P>
<P>
Kingdom arrived late after competing Thursday night at Verona, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"The meet didn't end until midnight and we didn't get here until 5:30 in the 
morning," Kingdom said. 
</P>
<P>
Dees started the year with a personal best of 13.54, and has improved to 
sixth-best American.

Why did Derrick Rostagno lose his third-round match at Wimbledon? 
</P>
<P>
"You can't hit what you can't see," Rostagno said. 
</P>
<P>
Rostagno, who eliminated John McEnroe in the first round, was overrun by Goran 
Ivanisevic, 18, of Yugoslavia, 6-2, 6-2, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Ivanisevic served 17 aces. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never played someone who's played that well," Rostagno said. 
</P>
<P>
Rostagno, 24, of Brentwood, was unable to break Ivanisevic's serve, but thought 
he played well. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave it all I had, so I can't get angry," said Rostagno, who has a sore 
throat. 
</P>
<P>
He said he isn't unnerved by losing, and plans to see the play, "Phantom of the 
Opera" before he leaves town. 
</P>
<P>
"Things can go wrong, things can go right," Rostagno said. "How serious can you 
take everything? This is a game. It's a great game, to be sure, but you can't 
forget what it is." THOMAS BONK

KITTLE'S HOMER POWERS CHICAGO, 1-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
His performance didn't rival the no-hit pitching of Oakland's Dave Stewart or 
the Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela, but the Chicago White Sox are beginning to 
believe Jack McDowell is about to live up to expectations. 
</P>
<P>
McDowell, the former Stanford star from Van Nuys, held the New York Yankees to 
four hits in seven innings at Chicago Friday night and improved to 5-4 when Ron 
Kittle hit a 454-foot home run to give the White Sox a 1-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
McDowell struck out eight and the White Sox, by winning their eighth in a row, 
remained ahead of Oakland in the West. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third victory in the last four decisions for McDowell, who has 
pitched three recent games in which he kept the White Sox in the game and they 
went on to win. 
</P>
<P>
Kittle's home run, in the second inning, was his 14th of the season and his 
fourth home run in his last six at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City 3, Detroit 2 -- Kevin Seitzer barely missed a home run in the 
seventh inning at Kansas City and eventually scored the tiebreaking run on Bo 
Jackson's single. 
</P>
<P>
Seitzer, hitting .422 in the last 11 games, hit the top of the left-field wall, 
but had to settle for a single. He was sacrificed to second and George Brett 
drew his fourth walk of the game before Jackson delivered. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm hitting .260 and they walk me four times," Brett said. "I guess it shows 
somebody still thinks you can play the game. Yeah, it makes me feel good." 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers have lost 11 in a row at Royals Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 6, Minnesota 2 -- Catcher Bob Melvin had two run-scoring singles, 
including one that drove in the go-ahead run in a four-run seventh at 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles chased Allan Anderson in the seventh inning. Anderson, who won 16 
games in 1988 for the Twins and was 17-10 last season, fell to 2-11. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Johnson (7-4), who needed help in the seventh, had no trouble with any of 
the Twins except Kent Hrbek, who had two doubles and his 10th home run. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 4, Boston 3 -- Ruben Sierra has come back strong after Rangers' Manager 
Bobby Valentine gave him a day off. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra, who homered in his first game back, doubled home the tiebreaking run 
with two outs in the ninth inning at Boston and the Rangers ended the Red Sox' 
seven-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 4, Milwaukee 2 -- Tracy Jones doubled home two unearned runs with two 
outs in the seventh inning for the Mariners at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Johnson (8-3) got his fifth consecutive victory and the Mariners won 
their third in a row. DAN HAFNER

<P>
I'm not a fearful person, but there are a few things that frighten me. 
</P>
<P>
Nuclear weapons. Moldy leftovers. Astronomical real estate prices. And men like 
Jack Thompson ("The 'Batman' Who Took On Rap" by Chuck Philips, June 18) 
frighten me. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson's virulent campaign to smother First Amendment freedoms is noteworthy 
not only for its vociferousness but also for its apparent success. 
</P>
<P>
When he says, "(God) has put the world together in such a way that government 
exists to point people God-ward," I become truly frightened. All this time I 
thought government existed to govern.

FACES . . . : REDDY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE ROARING NINETIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By DAVID PECCHIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Helen Reddy shudders to think what her career might have looked like had she 
been born a couple of decades later. 
</P>
<P>
"If 'I Am Woman' were coming out now, it could never become a hit," Reddy says 
in that Australian accent of hers. Her signature song, which she will perform 
alongside her other '70s hits at Santa Ana's Crazy Horse Saloon Monday night, 
took the better part of a year to scale the pop-chart heap. "Nine months," she 
emphasizes. "Nowadays, if something isn't up there in six weeks, they (record 
company officials) don't push it." 
</P>
<P>
Reddy, 48, hasn't been tearing up the charts lately, but she's just off a 
successful tour of England and is busy writing new material. The feisty but 
personable singer hopes to have an album recorded before the summer's out, but 
is discussing distribution only with overseas firms. Reddy's not ready to 
embrace a domestic label just yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they've got a clue as to how to market to my audience anyway," 
she asserts. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Reddy's audience still shows up, en masse, to hear her belt out "I Am 
Woman." When she sat down to write the No. 1 hit at the outset of the Me 
Decade, Reddy had nary a clue as to its anthem potential. Was she surprised 
when the record's success splashed her all over the map? Shocked, even? 
</P>
<P>
"All of the above," says Reddy, whose smile suddenly fades when the topic turns 
to the issue of the women's movement. 
</P>
<P>
"What is the women's movement?" she asks rhetorically, gazing into the '90s. "I 
would like to think that the '90s are going to see an improvement, in fact, as 
it seems there are a lot more women running for public office. I thought that 
the '80s were very regressive; there was a lot of backlash during that decade. 
But also, as the population ages, older women aren't as much of a threat. 
They're more acceptable in positions of power." 
</P>
<P>
Hear her roar. DAVID PECCHIA

THE NIGHT OF TWO NO-HITTERS; 
</P>
<P>
FERNANDO PITCHES ONE FOR THE FIRST TIME AS HE STYMIES CARDINALS, 6-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirty minutes before the Dodgers faced the St. Louis Cardinals Friday, 
Fernando Valenzuela noticed on a clubhouse television set that Oakland pitcher 
Dave Stewart had thrown a no-hitter in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
"Fernando turned to some teammates and he said, 'That's great, now maybe we'll 
see another no-hitter,' " Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela then pitched as well as he predicted, throwing the first no-hitter 
of his career in a 6-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in the modern baseball era that two no-hitters have been 
pitched on the same day, and the fifth no-hitter in the major leagues this 
season. It was the Dodgers' first no-hitter since Jerry Reuss had one against 
the San Francisco Giants on June 27, 1980, and only the team's second no-hitter 
since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"And it couldn't have happened to a tougher, more competitive guy," Lasorda 
said. "You look at Fernando and he has done everything in his career except a 
no-hitter. And now . . . this." 
</P>
<P>
Proving that he is more than a mere memory, Valenzuela provided new memories 
for the 38,583 at Dodger Stadium. Only four Cardinals reached base -- on three 
walks and an error -- and Valenzuela struck out seven. 
</P>
<P>
With Willie McGee on first base and one out in the ninth inning, former Dodger 
Pedro Guerrero hit a grounder up the middle that seemed destined for the 
outfield. But Valenzuela stuck out his glove, the ball nicked the leather and 
rolled to Juan Samuel, who stepped on second base and threw to first baseman 
Eddie Murray, who made the double-play catch that sent Dodgers running to the 
mound. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela did not throw his glove or jump up and down. He stood on the mound 
and jabbed his arms into the air until he was hugged by catcher Mike Scioscia. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you think if I don't touch that ball, it goes through for a single?" 
Valenzuela asked afterward. "Whoooa. I think it does. I think I don't touch it, 
I'm in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just glad to see Scioscia running to the mound from the plate. Only then 
did I know it was over. Thank goodness Alfredo Griffin made the catch and the 
throw." 
</P>
<P>
When reminded that it was Samuel who made the final play, Valenzuela laughed. 
</P>
<P>
"That shows you how excited I am," he said after improving to 6-6 with a 3.73 
earned-run average. "This is a great moment for me." 
</P>
<P>
A no-hitter by Valenzuela seemed a remote possibility, at least on paper. He 
had won only once in his last six starts. He had not beaten the Cardinals since 
May 6, 1988, in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
He was averaging 9.2 hits against him per nine innings. He had only thrown two 
complete games this season, including his first shutout since 1987 when he beat 
the Chicago Cubs, 5-0, April 27. 
</P>
<P>
He had never had a no-hitter or a one-hitter in his 10-year career. His best 
effort had been a two-hitter -- of which he had eight, the latest coming last 
Aug. 12 at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"But this is a different pitcher than in previous seasons," Scioscia said. 
"This guy is not as quick as the old Fernando, but this guy still knows how to 
win." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela's 10-year Dodger career began with Cy Young and rookie of the year 
awards in 1981, but had since fallen on hard times because of shoulder 
problems. He started well Friday night, struggled in the end and didn't need 
much help. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing close to a hit was a fly ball by Craig Wilson into the 
left-center field gap with one out in the eighth. It was chased down and 
grabbed by Stan Javier, who was playing because Kal Daniels was suffering back 
spasms. 
</P>
<P>
"The only hard-hit balls were foul balls," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, 29, breezed through the first six inings, only Guerrero reaching 
base when Gibson dropped his fly ball in left field with two outs in the first. 
At that point, Valenzuela had thrown 75 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
But in the final three innings, he threw 49 pitches, and was obviously tired. 
</P>
<P>
"But this was a different kind of tired," Valenzuela said. "This kind of tired 
did not bother me. You think I feel anything during those last inning? No way." 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the seventh, he began to struggle, walking Guerrero and Todd 
Zeile. But he settled to retire Terry Pendleton on a fly ball and Jose Oquendo 
on a grounder to third. 
</P>
<P>
He fell behind in the count to two of the three hitters he faced in the eighth, 
but still retired Rex Hudler on a grounder to shortstop, Ozzie Smith on a wild 
swinging strikeout and Wilson on the fly ball to Javier. 
</P>
<P>
During this time, his only conversations on the bench concerned his 
second-favorite topic, hitting. 
</P>
<P>
"All the starting pitchers have a bet as to who will hit higher, and we always 
talk about it," pitcher Mike Morgan said. "So when Fernando came back after 
making his first two outs at the plate, we would say, 'Oh for one,' and then 
'Oh for two' and he would shake his head." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela even got the last laugh there, as he singled to left and scored on 
Kirk Gibson's two-run single in the seventh. But by the ninth inning, everybody 
had forgotten about his bat. 
</P>
<P>
"We all had goose bumps," Morgan said. "We were all just watching and hoping 
and waiting to charge the field." 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, Valenzuela struck out Vince Coleman on a called third strike that 
caused Coleman to scream at home plate umpire Jerry Layne. McGee then walked on 
four pitches. But on an 0-and-2 count, Guerrero, celebrating his 34th birthday, 
ended the game. 
</P>
<P>
Offensively, Valenzuela was supported by two RBIs by Hubie Brooks and Gibson. 
Brooks scored runs on a fly ball and his first home run since June 9, his 10th 
overall. The Dodgers also scored on a suicide squeeze by Javier and an 
eighth-inning homer by Juan Samuel, his fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kal Daniels scratched himself from the starting lineup during batting practice 
Friday, the sixth consecutive start he has missed since his back injury. Stan 
Javier started in center field, and Kirk Gibson was moved to left field. It was 
a quick change of fortune for Javier, who earlier in the afternoon had been 
informed by Manager Tom Lasorda that he was being benched for at least one game 
to allow Gibson and Daniels to play in the same outfield. Javier entered Friday 
night's game with 15 hits in his last 16 games and a .411 batting average 
during that time. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Searage will return to Class-A Bakersfield today and Sunday for his 10th 
and 11th rehabilitation appearances. Searage, 1-2 with a 3.65 ERA for 
Bakersfield, has 16 strikeouts in 12 1/3 innings. He has been on the disabled 
list since May 14 because of a sore left elbow. 
</P>
<P>
Injured third baseman Jeff Hamilton took 40 swings during an eight-minute 
batting practice session, but said only two minutes of those swings felt good. 
He will try to hit on consecutive days for the first time today. . . . In a 
meeting earlier this month, Tim Belcher was elected as the Dodgers' full-time 
player representative, with Chris Gwynn the alternate. Belcher was only the 
interim representative last winter when he played a big role in the union 
negotiations with management. He had replaced the departed Dave Anderson.

THIS SEASON: The other 1990 no-hitters were by the Angels' Mark Langston (seven 
innings) and Mike Witt (two) against the Seattle Mariners April 11; by 
Seattle's Randy Johnson against the Detroit Tigers June 2; and Nolan Ryan of 
the Texas Rangers against Oakland June 11. 
</P>
<P>
SAME DAY: On May 2, 1917, at Chicago, Fred Toney of Cincinnati and James 
(Hippo) Vaughn of the Cubs pitched no-hitters in the same day, with Toney and 
the Reds beating Vaughn and the Cubs, 1-0, in 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
The previous time no-hitters were pitched on the same day in different games 
was April 22, 1898, by Ted Brietenstein of Cincinnati against Pittsburgh, and 
Jim Hughes of Baltimore against the Boston Braves. 
</P>
<P>
SAME MONTH: The last time there were four no-hitters in one month was in May of 
1917, all within five days. On May 2, the Toney-Vaughn double no-hitter was 
pitched. Three days later, Ernie Koob of the St. Louis Browns pitched a 
no-hitter against the Chicago White Sox. The next day Bob Groom, also of the 
Browns, repeated against the White Sox.

A nun from Naples noticed athletic young men in green and white sweat suits 
waiting to greet Pope John Paul II at his general audience at the Vatican on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Ours?" she asked with the paternalism of Italy's 57 million soccer coaches. 
</P>
<P>
"Theirs," a friend replied. "Irish." 
</P>
<P>
"Wha . . . " the nun began, but her indignation died aborning. "It doesn't 
matter," she said, smiling. "They'll still lose." 
</P>
<P>
Good coaching by former English star, Jack Charlton, now an honorary Irishman, 
has carried the Irish farther than they had any right to expect in Italia '90. 
The luck of the Irish has meant advancing to the quarterfinals without winning 
a game, except for a penalty shootout against Romania after two overtimes had 
failed to break a scoreless tie. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, it will take more than luck and a papal blessing to get Ireland past 
Italy in the Olympic Stadium here that is Europe's raucous 20th-Century answer 
to the Colosseum. The winner plays Argentina or Yugoslavia in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
The Italians have won all four of their Cup matches, and have done it without 
yielding a goal. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, they have found a national hero of their own: chunky, dynamic 
Salvatore Schillaci, called "Toto," who scores goals with intensity and pounces 
on opponents' mistakes. A banner in the streets of the Palermo suburb where he 
was reared reads: "Dio perdona, Schillaci no." God forgives, Schillaci doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
A Sicilian who labored long and anonymously in the vineyards of provincial 
Italian soccer, Schillaci is now public property. Everything, from the mewling 
of his newborn daughter to the bagginess of his pants, is scrutinized and 
weighed for significance. In a country historically split between a rich, 
educated north and a poor, unlettered south, the aw-shucks Sicilian has united 
Italy in a way politics never could. 
</P>
<P>
Schillaci, 26, will team with his Juventus teammate Roberto Baggio, the world's 
highest-paid soccer player, at the spearhead of Italy's attack tonight. 
Versatile Roberto Donadoni returns to the midfield to replace twice 
yellow-carded Nicola Berti in the only change in the Italian lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Franco Baresi, a sweeper who has been ranked as the best in the world for the 
last three years, anchors the Italian defense in front of goalkeeper Walter 
Zenga, who has not allowed a goal in his last 802 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland, the oldest team in the tournament with an average age of 29, seemingly 
is overmatched. Most of its players are from the English first division, having 
discovered their Irish roots under Charlton's genealogical guidance. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Bonner, who sank Romania by turning away a sudden-death penalty kick, 
is stubborn in the net. Tony Cascarino, whom Charlton calls the "Ice Cream Man" 
because of his Italian roots, will be most closely watched on attack. But the 
Irish, with only two goals in regulation time, are among the weakest scoring 
teams in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
They also play some of the least attractive soccer, emerging from a defensive 
shell into an always-in-the-air, kick-and-run-down-the-sidelines game that 
Italian commentators describe as "arid" and "Garabaldian" because of its 
guerrilla flavor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only game we know how to play," Charlton said at a news conference. 
"Ours is an old, out-of-date game." 
</P>
<P>
He blamed the lack of finesse on England's having been banned from club 
competition in Europe after hooligan violence in Belgium in 1985 had claimed 
the lives of 39 fans, most of them Italian. 
</P>
<P>
"Being banished has been a terrible blow for our young players," he said. "Our 
progress is stopped because we can't play against other types of soccer. Ours 
is not splendid isolation. It's just isolation." 
</P>
<P>
Italian Coach Azeglio Vicini has warned his players against overconfidence for 
a game that will draw about 10,000 Irish fans, among them Prime Minister 
Charles Haughey, to the giant stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Italy's soccer public, from cabinet ministers to the Communist opponents to 
partisan nuns and the officially neutral Pope, demands nothing less than a 
victory tonight. Having come so far with so relatively little, the Irish can go 
home with their heads high, win or lose. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the advantages Ireland has is that it will go into the game free of 
worries, knowing that they have nothing to lose and everything to gain," noted 
Aldo Serena, a reserve striker who scored Italy's last goal against Uruguay in 
the second-round qualifier Monday night.

THE NIGHT OF TWO NO-HITTERS;

<P>
A'S STEWART PULLS OUT OF JUNE SWOON, STOPS BLUE JAYS IN SKYDOME

<P>
Dave Stewart, baseball's dominant pitcher in April, helped make this a June to 
remember. 
</P>
<P>
The Oakland Athletics' right-hander, who had lost six of 10 decisions since 
going 5-0 in April, pitched a no-hit, 5-0 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays 
Friday night. It was baseball's fourth no-hitter this season and third in June, 
coming only hours before Fernando Valenzuela's no-hitter for the Dodgers 
against St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
"The more you think about the guys coming out of their dugout, the more you 
realize just what this means," Stewart said. "You look at the Bells, the 
Fernandezes and the Grubers, and you know you've done a job." 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Jays lead the league in runs scored, home runs and runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
"About the fifth inning, I was aware that I had one," Stewart said. "I just 
kept thinking 'One hitter at a time, one strike at a time.' 
</P>
<P>
"I was getting the fastball over, and when I went to the forkball it worked for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, 33, struck out a season-high 12 in ending a streak during which he had 
lost his last three decisions and five of the last six. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt real good," he said. "I had a crisp fastball tonight and my location 
was really good. If they were going to beat me, they were going to have to beat 
my number one -- my fastball. I used that to set up my off-speed stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart struggled early, walking the first two, then was perfect until a 
two-out walk in the ninth. Tony Fernandez flied to center to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I was calm all night," Stewart said. "It hasn't sunk in yet. But maybe that's 
a good thing or I'll start thinking I can do it all the next time." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart did not need much help from his fielders. The only ball that came close 
to being a hit was Fernandez's grounder leading off the fourth inning. First 
baseman Mark McGwire darted to his right and went to his knees to backhand the 
ball and flipped to Stewart covering for the out. 
</P>
<P>
Before grounding out, Fernandez ripped a line drive that struck first base 
umpire Tim Welke. Welke had to look down to make sure he was standing in foul 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
Fred McGriff hit the longest ball off Stewart, a drive that center fielder Dave 
Henderson caught at the 400-foot sign. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart stopped for a minute on that one," Stewart said. "I thought that 
might be the first hit. But it was to the deepest part of the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought McGriff's ball would at least be a double off the wall, especially 
after Hendu broke so hard on it." 
</P>
<P>
His reaction when Henderson caught it? 
</P>
<P>
"Whew!" Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Said McGriff: "Didn't quite get all of it. He's a classy guy. You hate to be 
no-hit, but you have to feel good for Stewart." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dave Henderson: "The first seven innings, he was the same old Stew. When 
he got into the eighth and ninth, guys started moving away from him (in the 
dugout). "I didn't want to be around him. I didn't want him to blame me (if the 
no-hitter failed)." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Henderson and Rickey Henderson hit two-run homers against John Cerutti 
(4-6) as the Blue Jays lost their fifth consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
Said A's Manager Tony La Russa: "In the ninth inning, all of a sudden I wanted 
it real bad for him. And when you want it real bad, you get real nervous. . . . 
It was important for Stew personally, and he deserves it. 
</P>
<P>
"He looked a lot like Nolan (Ryan) the last few innings. Those great ones, when 
they smell it -- damn, they turn it up." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart's was the second no-hitter against the Blue Jays in their 14-year 
history. Cleveland's Len Barker pitched a perfect game against Toronto May 15, 
1981. It was the first no-hitter by an Oakland pitcher since Mike Warren 
pitched one against the White Sox Sept. 29, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart has won 20 or more games three years in a row, but has been beaten out 
for the Cy Young Award by Roger Clemens, Frank Viola and Bret Saberhagen. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart started the 1989 All-Star game and was voted most valuable player of 
the 1989 World Series after winning two of Oakland's four games in a sweep of 
the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the highlight of my career," Stewart said. "Winning 20 ballgames, 
that's something because they don't have to vote on 20 wins. But I thought 
after winning a World Series and an MVP that you couldn't top that. This does." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart began the first by walking Junior Felix, who was caught stealing by 
Terry Steinbach. Stewart also walked Fernandez and then retired 25 before 
walking Felix with two outs in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The sellout crowd of 49,817 was silent as Stewart went to the mound for the 
ninth. An estimated 7,000 had left the SkyDome with the Blue Jays trailing. 
</P>
<P>
The scoreboard urged the crowd to cheer for the Blue Jays, and they did, but it 
did not help. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd then began cheering and rhythmic clapping, this time for Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a great feeling, something I'll always remember." 
</P>
<P>
One Blue Jay who didn't get a chance to face Stewart was Nelson Liriano. The 
Blue Jays' part-time second baseman broke up consecutive no-hit bids by the 
Angels' Kirk McCaskill and Rangers' Nolan Ryan with hits in the ninth inning in 
the span of a week last season.

TORO FINISHES THIRD IN FINAL TRIP TO POST 
</P>

For a fleeting instant, Fernando Toro thought he might exit a winner. 
</P>
<P>
After having some trouble down the backstretch in the $83,300 Fiesta Handicap 
Friday night at Hollywood Park, Exclusive Partner, Toro's final mount in his 
34-year career, was starting to roll. 
</P>
<P>
"He gave me a jump because I thought he might be able to make it," the rider 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't to be for Toro in his 27,610th start. Exclusive Partner had to settle 
for third, beaten by three lengths. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't bad, though, for the last one," said Toro, who had been honored in a 
winner's circle ceremony after the fifth race. "Not bad at all. My horse gave 
it a good try. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was coming back after the race, it all started to catch up with me. I 
felt a little bit sad. I thought I was going to cry. I felt a little bit 
emotional. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, I said to myself, well, we made it. For the last time. We gave it a good 
try and that's the main thing." 
</P>
<P>
Live The Dream, an 8-1 shot, overhauled pacesetter Fly Till Dawn to win the 
Fiesta, which was run at 1 1/16 miles on the turf, by a neck. A 4-year-old son 
of Northern Baby trained by Charlie Whittingham and ridden by Alex Solis, Live 
The Dream is something of an specialist after dark. He also won the Hollywood 
Derby under the lights last Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
The attendance Friday night was 22,928, compared to 24,529 the previous week, 
but better than track officials had estimated. . . . Having determined the 
horse isn't competitive on this circuit, Hollywood Park management refused 
Thursday to let Mighty Buck, an 8-year-old who has been last in seven 
consecutive races, enter today's third race, a $20,000 claimer at 1 1/16 miles. 
. . . Julio Garcia, disqualified aboard Orrefor in Thursday's seventh race, was 
suspended five days by the stewards, beginning next Wednesday.

PATRIOTS DECRIED BY AGENT; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: HE SAYS FORMER NEW ENGLAND LINEMAN SIMS SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN 
COUNSELING BEFORE BEING WAIVED.

<P>
The agent for waived New England Patriot defensive end Kenneth Sims said Friday 
that the team failed to adhere to the NFL's drug policy in not providing 
counseling after Sims had tested positive for banned substances. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Witt Stewart of Sherman Oaks threatened to sue the NFL, saying "Nobody 
knows what the drug policy is." 
</P>
<P>
Although the league has an established drug policy, it has been under fire 
recently. That criticism resulted in the resignation of Dr. Forest Tennant as 
the NFL's drug adviser Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Sullivan, Patriot general manager, told Boston television station WCVB 
Friday that, in accordance with the drug guidelines, Sims had been offered 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
"We made an effort to pay for Kenneth Sims' rehabilitation before he was 
waived," Sullivan said. "That offer still exists." 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said Friday that the only offer made to Sims was on June 19, when he 
was waived. 
</P>
<P>
"Patrick said the club would pay the deductible on the insurance policy," said 
Stewart, adding that Sims was considering obtaining counseling in his home 
state of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Sims cleared waivers Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The 1981 Outland Trophy winner as college football's best lineman, Sims, of the 
University of Texas, was the first player chosen in the 1982 NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Sims was among a group of six Patriots who tested positive for 
marijuana. The tests received additional notoriety when it was learned that 
their results were not released until the club had played the Chicago Bears in 
Super Bowl XX in January of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1987, test results showed Sims to have cocaine in his system, 
according to documents revealed by Washington television reporter Roberta 
Baskin Friday at an Associated Press Sports Editors' seminar here. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said that the test was used only to make Sims take additional tests, 
which he passed until September of 1988, when results showed a trace of cocaine 
in his system. Stewart said Sims denied having used cocaine during that period. 
</P>
<P>
At no time during that period had Sims been offered counseling, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
Sims signed a two-year contract with the Patriots May 24 that would have paid 
him $300,000 for the 1990 season and $400,000 in 1991, plus bonuses. He was 
arrested for allegedly driving 85 m.p.h. on an Austin (Tex.) freeway in early 
June. Police said that while he was getting out his driver's license, an 
envelope said to contain two-tenths of a gram of cocaine fell from Sims' 
wallet. A charge for possession was lodged. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots then waived Sims, saying he had not been in good enough physical 
condition during a mini-camp. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said he had sought clarification of Sims' drug status with the league 
and had been told, "I don't know" by Sullivan, who instructed him to call the 
NFL. Stewart said the league office has not returned his three phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to reach Sullivan at his vacation home on Cape Cod Friday were 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said that the Patriots' action and the furor surrounding Tennant's 
resignation shows that whatever policy the NFL has is "not about helping 
anybody. It's about policing people."

Ram radio announcer Bob Starr will not be returning next season, after all. 
</P>
<P>
Starr, now a radio announcer for the Boston Red Sox, had been negotiating with 
KMPC to return after the baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to work things out, but, because of Bob's commitments, just couldn't 
do it," KMPC General Manager Bill Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
Ward said Eddie Doucette, previously hired as a fill-in for Starr, will become 
the permanent radio voice of the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Youngblood is expected to return as the commentator, but Ward said, "We 
are still negotiating with Jack." LARRY STEWART

Which is the largest U.S. branch of Judaism: Reform or Conservative? It turns 
out that no one has precise figures, and top officials put the two movements at 
about the same size. 
</P>
<P>
In separate stories this week, The Times identified Reform and Conservative as 
the biggest. 
</P>
<P>
Reform officials have estimated their U.S. members at about 1.3 million and 
worldwide membership at about 1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Despite higher estimates by some Conservative officials, Rabbi Jerome Epstein 
of New York, chief executive officer of Conservative's United Synagogue of 
America, said Thursday that Conservative Judaism may have between 1.3 million 
and 1.4 million U.S. members and about 1.5 million members worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
"Reform and Conservative Judaism are still neck-and-neck," Epstein said. "The 
trouble is that in both movements many synagogues only report how many families 
are members, not how many individuals." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bruce Phillips of Hebrew Union College's Los Angeles faculty said at 
the annual convention of Reform rabbis in Seattle this week that he thought 
Conservative enjoys a slight edge over Reform in affiliations, but that the 
standings will change soon. 
</P>
<P>
"The demographic trend is toward a more liberal Judaism in terms of how people 
think of themselves," Phillips said. "It will be the only movement in the 
United States that will be able to attract . . . fourth- and fifth-generation 
Jews, Jews in mixed marriages and the children of those marriages." 
</P>
<P>
Orthodox Judaism, widely considered third nationally in synagogue affiliations, 
is represented by many different organizations but will continue to grow, 
Phillips predicted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DATES 
</P>
<P>
The Conservative Baptists of America, which has 1,200 member churches in this 
country, opened its six-day national convention Friday at the Anaheim 
Convention Center. 
</P>

"Jesus and Woody Allen: Two Jewish Theologians" is the topic of New Testament 
scholar Bernard Brandon Scott 8 p.m. Thursday at Mount St. Mary's Doheny campus 
in downtown Los Angeles.

More than 15,000 U.S. and Latin American Catholics are expected to attend the 
16th annual, three-day "Encuentro Latino Internacional" starting Friday at the 
Los Angeles Sports Arena. JOHN DART

NEW YORK FESTIVAL: THE 72-YEAR-OLD SINGER AND THE 28-YEAR-OLD TRUMPETER JOINED 
IN A MEMORABLE VERSION OF 'THE BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC.'

Festivals make strange bedfellows. Both the Wednesday and Thursday concerts at 
Avery Fisher Hall had as their headliners two singers normally associated with 
jazz, with an opening set provided by a small band featuring an adventurous 
young trumpeter. 
</P>
<P>
The co-billing of Pearl Bailey and Wynton Marsalis was not as incongruous as it 
might have seemed. It was in the band of trumpeter Cootie Williams that Bailey 
got her start, and half buried among her shtick, the Social Security jokes, the 
dancing and the strutting, there was a voice that remains rich and warm and 
true. Bailey's versions of "Unforgettable," "For Once in My Life" and "Read My 
Mind" (this last with an admirable guitar solo by Remo Palmier) gave proof 
through the night that her sound was still there. 
</P>
<P>
With her husband, Louie Bellson, at the drums leading a quartet that included 
Paul Smith at the piano and bassist Keter Betts, Bailey went through all her 
hit-song motions, complete with "Hello, Dolly!," before offering a surprise 
ending. The 28-year-old Marsalis came back to join the 72-year-old singer in a 
heartfelt rendering of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic." It was one of the JVC 
Jazz Festival's memorable moments. 
</P>
<P>
The opening set by Marsalis, leading a septet, consisted of two new, long, 
unrecorded works. The 35-minute "Uptown Ruler Suite" included a theme taken 
from a Beethoven string quartet, a movement involving a 12-tone row, and a 
piece written by his tenor saxophonist, Todd Williams. The final segment, "Down 
Home With Homey," was the most engaging melodically, but throughout the suite 
Marsalis and his sidemen, notably Los Angeles' Eric Reid on piano and Wycliffe 
Gordon on trombone, offered insightful ad-lib variations. 
</P>
<P>
Marsalis' recent work has involved a curious dichotomy. As a soloist, he has 
all but abandoned the early Miles Davis overtones, leaning now towards such 
older stylists as Cootie Williams and Rex Stewart; meanwhile, compositionally, 
he has moved forward into adventurous experiments in form. 
</P>
<P>
His second piece, "Blue Interlude," was more traditional in nature, with 
quasi-Dixieland passages (Williams switched to clarinet), skirting in and out 
of the blues. 
</P>
<P>
If his abandonment of the 1960s Miles Davis has left a void, it may well be 
filled by the youthful Harper Brothers Quintet, who opened the Thursday 
recital. Philip Harper is as assured and fluent a trumpeter as can be heard on 
the contemporary scene, and he has his match in Justin Robinson, the 
21-year-old alto saxophonist, and in pianist Kevin Hayes. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-bop origins of this group are evident in their choice of material: Lee 
Morgan's charming "Ceora," old pieces by Horace Silver and Sonny Clark and, for 
good measure, an impeccable ballad medley of "I Can't Get Started" by Robinson 
and "Portrait of Jennie" by Philip Harper, whose brother, the drummer Winard 
Harper, and bassist Eric Lemon round out this ebullient unit. 
</P>
<P>
The second half of the bill was occupied by Regina Belle, a soul singer whose 
diminutive size was more than compensated by her stentorian voice, her two 
hefty female backup singers, two synthesizer manipulators, and a general 
ambience that was about as appropriate to a jazz festival as 2 Live Crew. 
</P>
<P>
The piano recital Thursday afternoon at Weill Hall (adjoining Carnegie) by 
Abdullah Ibrahim (a.k.a. Dollar Brand) displayed the South African pianist in a 
full hour of uninterrupted, unaccompanied explorations. This was less a tour de 
force than a world tour, taking in snatches of Ellington, blues, West Indian 
motifs, gospel, and moving unpredictably from low key out of tempo ramblings to 
double fortissimo tremolos. 
</P>
<P>
For an encore, Ibrahim stood up and sang what sounded like a mixture of an 
African chant and Ellington's "Jump for Joy," while slapping his thighs for 
rhythm. At 55, he remains the complete original he has been since he arrived 
here from Capetown in the 1960s.

About 200 uniformed police and riot troops used a sledgehammer to break into 
the barred entrances of the Agriculture Ministry, clearing the building of 
hundreds of farmers in the third day of a sit-in strike to protest low prices 
for their crops. It was the first show of force by the Solidarity-led 
government since it came to power last August. 
</P>
<P>
After authorities entered the Ministry in central Warsaw about 7:30 p.m., the 
majority of farmers went peacefully. A few put up a vigorous defense, many of 
them weeping openly. Police said there were no arrests or injuries. Earlier, 
the farmers were holding a top Cabinet member as a symbolic hostage. It was not 
immediately known whether the minister was released.

The government of Israel will pay $20,000 to each of the families of seven 
Palestinians killed May 20 by an Israeli impersonating a soldier, a Defense 
Ministry spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that Israel is not obligated to make the payments but is 
offering the money because of the "unique circumstances" of the killings. The 
gunman shot down the seven, from the occupied Gaza Strip, while they waited for 
work as day laborers in the town of Rishon le Zion near Tel Aviv. The killings 
inflamed tensions throughout the occupied lands and touched off a wave of 
rioting.

<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian quickly signed a bill Friday to delay for one month the 
required cost-of-living increases for welfare mothers and children. The 
Legislature passed the bill by Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan (D-Fresno) Thursday to 
give leaders more flexibility in ongoing budget negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
State law would otherwise require the 4.6% cost-of-living increases to begin 
Sunday for recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children. The bill 
suspends those increases for a month, along with increases for in-home 
supportive services and county health services. Lawmakers and the governor have 
been unable to reach agreement on a budget for the 1990-91 fiscal year that 
begins Sunday. Deukmejian has proposed freezing welfare benefits as part of a 
final budget compromise. If the increases had been allowed to take effect, it 
would have been legally difficult to change benefits later this month.

One of the animals arrived at the center dead, two others died later and the

fragments were found in its left side, said center spokeswoman Denize Springer. 
A reward is being collected for information leading to the arrest of the people

FLOOD OF TIPS ON GLENDALE BLAZE COMPLICATES ARSON INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Glendale arson investigators culled dozens of tips from the public Friday but 
said they had come up with no new useful information in an expanding search for 
an arson suspect. in Wednesday's San Rafael Hills fire. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Fire Capt. John Orr said Friday that a flood of about 50 tips and 
sightings of possibly suspicious behavior of people in five automobiles had 
only made the picture more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
At a Town Hall meeting scheduled Friday night at the Glendale Civic Auditorium, 
fire officials were expected to report that about half of the leads had been 
exhausted without bringing the investigation closer to success, and that owners 
of two of the five cars had been eliminated from consideration. 
</P>
<P>
An arson task force headed by Orr continuesd to search for occupants of a late 
1970s blue Honda seen near the source of Wednesday's fire just as it started. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials initially described that car as the focus of the investigation 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent eyewitness accounts placed two other cars near the Honda, Orr said. 
Orr declined to describe those cars. In addition, two more cars aroused 
suspicions in nearby brush areas on Tuesday and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A La Canada Flintridge resident reported seeing a blue car near the location 
where a fire broke out Tuesday on Angeles Crest Highway, causing damage to nine 
homes. On Thursday, a blue car parked at the end of a brushy cul-de-sac in 
Montrose drove off quickly as a resident came to investigate, Orr said. 
</P>
<P>
However, neither of those cars were the same as the blue Honda seen at 
Wednesday's fire, Orr said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses provided the license plate numbers for three of the five cars whose 
owners are being sought. Orr declined to say which license numbers corresponded 
to which cars. He said the owners of two of those cars had been contacted by 
Friday afternoon and were cleared of any connection to the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Arson is suspected because firefighters found an altered butane lighter in the 
area where the fire began on Verdugo Road. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Glendale Fire Department spokesman Chris Gray said investigators 
were seeking two men, age 20 to 25, who were seen in the blue Honda. 
</P>
<P>
"The possibility is the blue car is a witness only," Orr said. "We are urging 
them to come forward to eliminate them as suspects." 
</P>
<P>
Orr also said Friday that initial reports that the Glendale fire was one of 
three started with a butane lighter countywide turned out to be unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
Orr leads a Glendale task force of three two-member teams. The Glendale 
investigation was proceeding independently from others, but Orr said that he 
expected to meet early next week to share information with investigators from 
Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties.

Andrea Gurka tried to outrun the wall of flames that raced up Old San Marcos 
Pass Road on Wednesday night, consuming her home and hundreds of others along 
the winding mountain canyon. 
</P>
<P>
She made it to the creek bed, but no further. A search-and-rescue team found 
the 37-year-old woman's body there Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
In Riverside County, Victor Ferrera, 23, of San Diego, an inmate-firefighter 
from a Department of Corrections camp, was among a 17-member crew overrun by 
flames Wednesday afternoon near Hemet when a whirling wind suddenly shifted the 
brush fire they were fighting. Ferrera died of his injuries the next day. 
</P>
<P>
For all the huge destruction wrought by fire this week, there have been 
surprisingly few deaths. So far, Gurka and Ferrera are the only ones reported 
in the massive blazes that swept from Santa Barbara to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, smaller fires have frequently resulted in higher death tolls. For 
instance, the 1985 Baldwin Hills fire in Los Angeles, which destroyed 48 homes, 
killed three people. Ten people died in the 1970 fire that raged from Newhall 
to Malibu, destroying more than 400 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials attribute the low death toll in this year's fires, which 
consumed thousands of acres and more than 500 homes, to a combination of 
improved training, public education, interagency coordination -- and luck. 
</P>
<P>
"You have the best of your training and you put it into effect when emergencies 
like this come up -- sometimes you're fortunate and other times you're not," 
said Cindy Webster, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service and Santa Barbara 
County public agencies. "This time, our investment paid off and we're 
grateful." 
</P>
<P>
Training in recent years among fire-fighting agencies, including those serving 
Glendale and Santa Barbara -- two of the hardest-hit areas in this week's fires 
-- has increasingly focused on safety, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We stress safety more now than we did perhaps 10 years ago," said Capt. Al 
Kepler, a spokesman for the Glendale Fire Department. City firefighters are 
subjected to more intense and longer training, which continues even after 
firefighters are on the job, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not surprised by the low death toll, not with the training we're given," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters often are shown pictures and videotapes of fires where something 
went wrong and tragedy resulted, Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
"The training is very realistic, even grim," she said. "We see the mistakes 
that people have made that have gotten them killed, and we learn from them." 
</P>
<P>
Webster added that interagency emergency planning efforts have also helped in 
reducing the chaos that can lead to injury or death. Various agencies, 
including state forestry, county and city fire protection departments, have 
also stepped up public safety campaigns in recent years in the Santa Barbara 
area, she said. Residents have been bombarded with leaflets, radio public 
service announcements and presentations at homeowners' association meetings, 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really made a difference," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, given the severity of the wind-swept fires that destroyed entire 
neighborhoods in the Santa Barbara area, Webster said "it's amazing" that more 
people weren't killed in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
In Glendale, where a fast-moving blaze destroyed 46 homes before the fire was 
brought under control Wednesday night, officials were grateful that the fire 
began during daylight hours and that it occurred in an area with easy access to 
fire equipment and for the evacuation of residents. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential for injury is much greater in the dark and when people may be 
sleeping," said Kepler, adding: "I guess luck explains the low injury rate as 
well as anything." 
</P>
<P>
Luck, however, bypassed Gurka and Ferrera. 
</P>
<P>
The last anyone heard from Gurka was when she called her husband at work to 
tell him the flames were quickly approaching their home. She was without a car 
and was unsure of what to do, according to Fire Department officials. A search 
and rescue team went looking for her after her husband reported her missing. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrera, one of seven children of a San Diego metal worker and his wife, had 
been in minor trouble with the law over drugs since he was a kid, a Department 
of Corrections official said. He was serving his first long-term sentence -- 
this time for an armed robbery while high on drugs -- at the Bautista 
Conservation Camp in Hemet. 
</P>
<P>
Counselers at the camp said he was well-behaved and "kind of a quiet guy," the 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez reported from Los Angeles and Dunn from Santa Barbara.

IS THERE A BETTER WAY TO HANDLE THE CITY BUDGET?; 
</P>
<P>
CRUNCH: MARATHON CITY HALL JUGGLING ACT TO BALANCE THE SAN DIEGO BUDGET LEAVES 
MANY DISILLUSIONED WITH THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council's mad dash on Thursday night to balance the upcoming 
budget seemed to leave most council members and City Hall observers convinced 
that there has to be a better, or at least less painful, way to get the job 
done. 
</P>
<P>
For many, the light at the end of the budgeting tunnel seems to be a long-range 
business plan that would place limits on the seemingly never-ending attempt to 
make scarce revenue keep pace with an ever-increasing list of proposed 
expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
That juggling act reached what some observers described as new lows during the 
recently completed budget review that culminated in Thursday's seven-hour 
meeting, when council members used tax and fee increases and service cuts to 
balance a $470-million general fund budget. 
</P>
<P>
The just-completed process "raises concerns about the posturing early on on 
just how serious this budget crunch was," said Jim Ryan, executive director of 
the San Diego County Taxpayers Assn. "This (budget process) has been played out 
at such a high level for so many months that it got many people riled up and 
upset." 
</P>
<P>
Emotions ran high Thursday, as more than 300 San Diegans jammed City Hall 
elevators on the way up to the council's 12th-floor chambers. Most came to 
protest the council's earlier decision to reduce funding to four organizations 
that promote the city as a tourist and business mecca. 
</P>
<P>
During the first half of the meeting, the overflow crowd watched as council 
members patched together a $25.9-million package of budget cuts and tax and fee 
increases that eliminated most of the $38-million general fund shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 8:30 p.m., when the council seemed to be at a loss for further 
cuts and revenue increases, City Manager John Lockwood recommended that the 
council balance the budget by trimming $12.1 million more from various programs 
and capital improvement projects. 
</P>
<P>
Lockwood identified some of those cuts -- including the elimination of $4 
million that had been earmarked to buy land for a new police substation in 
District 4. 
</P>
<P>
But the council directed Lockwood to use his discretion when it comes to making 
about $10 million in cuts, a directive that left some council members wondering 
if the budget was indeed balanced. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly don't know where some of those cuts will occur," Councilman Ron 
Roberts said Friday. "I'm still puzzled and, quite frankly, I'm a little 
disappointed that something like that could happen in the budget process." 
</P>
<P>
Roberts was insistent that Lockwood not make the cuts from the police and fire 
budgets that he fought hard to protect during the lengthy budget process. 
Roberts pledged to protect those departments when the budget ordinance returns 
to the council July 18. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer on Friday made it clear that she would 
not stand idly by if Lockwood attempted to balance the budget on the backs of 
the city's "people programs" such as parks, recreation and libraries. 
</P>
<P>
And, Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt on Friday maintained that the people programs 
"are taken care of in this budget. . . . For the first time in history they 
have a fair share of the pie." Bernhardt echoed Wolfsheimer's belief that 
"people programs" are not to be touched by the upcoming round of cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bruce Henderson suggested attrition as an obvious way to cut the 
budget. City employment, which now stands at about 9,000, will "still grow 
during the coming year, but just not as fast," Henderson said. Bernhardt 
suggested Lockwood could find $4.5 million in needed cuts simply by limiting 
the employees who are hired next year to replace workers who retire or resign. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who fought hard in recent weeks for a budget that would 
freeze most city departments at their current annual levels, believes the $10 
million in cuts should be spread across the board, mayoral spokesman Paul 
Downey said Friday. "Everybody may be hurt a little bit," Downey said. 
</P>
<P>
When it came time Thursday to increase revenue, council members carefully 
crafted a package of tax and fee increases that was designed to insulate most 
San Diegans from direct contact with those taxes. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, most of the taxes will be felt by San Diego businesses. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the council increased the business license fee to $125, up from 
$30. And, the City Council instituted a fee on landlords who rent residential 
properties. Tourists will pay a 3% tax on rental cars hired in the city limits, 
and the 9% hotel and motel occupancy tax was extended to recreational vehicle 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
But council members on Thursday rejected a utility user tax on business and 
commercial customers of gas, electric, cable and telephone companies. 
</P>
<P>
That cautious approach to raising taxes was part of the council's strategy to 
seek support in November for tax increases that would fund specific programs. 
Council members on Thursday directed the city manager to report back on five 
possible tax increases that could be placed before voters in November. The five 
proposals being considered are: 
</P>
<P>
* A $20-million property tax that would be used to finance the employee 
retirement fund, which is now financed through the general fund, the same fund 
that provides for public safety, recreation and library services. 
</P>
<P>
* A $24.5-million property tax designed to increase the number of police 
officers in San Diego. The ballot issue, if successful, would increase the 
police ratio to two officers for every 1,000 city residents. 
</P>
<P>
* A ballot issue that would repeal a 1919 ordinance that provided free refuse 
collection for all city residents. The ballot issue would allow the city to 
charge about $90 a year for refuse pickup. 
</P>
<P>
* A bond issue that would raise $100 million for the purchase of new open 
space, as well as for maintenance of existing parks and open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
* A $140-million library bond issue that would fund construction of a new, 
downtown central library and the rehabilitation or construction of nearly a 
dozen branch facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Those proposed ballot initiatives would play an integral role in the five-year 
plan O'Connor hopes to fashion with the help of a committee that soon will be 
appointed, Downey said. 
</P>
<P>
Although council members seem to agree with O'Connor on the need for a 
five-year plan, there is disagreement on what that plan should include. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm puzzled by the mayor's talk of putting a five-year plan on the ballot," 
Roberts said. "We started out talking about a five-year plan that we could use 
as a planning tool. I don't know how that got switched into a ballot issue." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson questioned the wisdom of attempting to place so many ballot 
initiatives on the ballot in November. "You can have all of them go down," said 
Henderson, who recommended that the council consider placing a single bond 
issue -- the open space initiative -- on the ballot in November.

ADVOCATE FOR MIGRANTS SAVORS VICTORY; 
</P>
<P>
RIGHTS: RULING VINDICATES BIOCHEMIST WHOSE INDIGNATION MOVED HIM TO BE A PARTY 
IN LAWSUIT AGAINST ENCINITAS BAN ON CURBSIDE HIRING.

<P>
Peter Tobias sat in the back row of a federal courtroom in downtown San Diego 
Thursday, trying to decide if courthouse decorum allowed him to cheer, clap his 
hands and yell at the top of his lungs. 
</P>
<P>
After all, a judge had just rendered a passionate decision that Tobias and an 
entourage of migrant advocates had been anxiously awaiting -- granting a 
temporary restraining order against a curbside hiring ban in Encinitas many 
felt was an infringement of the right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
Tobias, however, isn't a migrant laborer. He isn't a lawyer or a professional 
worker's advocate or any courtroom regular. 
</P>
<P>
He's a 45-year-old Scripps Clinic biochemist and Encinitas resident who just 
got tired of what he called the city's heavy-handed policy in dealing with its 
growing population of migrant laborers from Mexico and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
So, when the city took what he considered yet another harsh stand in passing 
its curbside hiring ordinance, Tobias took a stand of his own. 
</P>
<P>
He became a plaintiff on a recent lawsuit filed by the ACLU and a migrant 
advocacy group against the hiring ban, joining five others that include migrant 
laborers, advocates and a socially conscious attorney. 
</P>
<P>
The athletic, gray-haired Tobias is perhaps the most unlikely player in the 
battle for migrant's rights in the North County beachside town, a concerned 
citizen who described his involvement in the issue as a simmering pot that 
finally boiled over. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just surprised there weren't 50 other people out there doing the same 
thing I was," he said. "I've always had this sense of sympathy and outrage at 
the way these workers were being manhandled by the city. And that curbside 
hiring ban was the trigger." 
</P>
<P>
Tobias, a 10-year resident of Encinitas, is no stranger to community affairs. 
He worked on both of the city's incorporation efforts and is a member of one of 
its community action boards. 
</P>
<P>
But there was no other issue, he says, that got beneath his skin as much as the 
City Council's often-steadfast stance on the migrant issue. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, he had appeared before the council to voice his displeasure over 
their migrant policies, claiming that it just wasn't right to enact laws aimed 
at sweeping hundreds of needy, poverty-stricken people into the next city or 
county. 
</P>
<P>
What was needed, he told council members, were programs to help the families 
that were living there. After all, he said, isn't that what living in America 
was all about? 
</P>
<P>
At one meeting, Tobias even read the Pledge of Allegiance before council 
members to make his point that the credo applied to everybody. 
</P>
<P>
The response, he recalled, "was amused tolerance." 
</P>
<P>
But last month, he took a different approach at a council meeting addressing a 
proposed curbside hiring ban -- a plan to fine would-be employers who hired 
workers from city street corners, depriving laborers of one of their few means 
of employment. 
</P>
<P>
"At an earlier meeting to discuss the issue, there had been only four speakers, 
and three of them had spoken out in favor of the law. I thought, 'This is 
absurd.' 
</P>
<P>
"So I stood up and told the council that this law would be a violation of my 
rights to free speech and peaceful assembly. But Councilwoman Marjorie Gaines 
said that a vast number of citizens in Encinitas wanted the hiring hall. 
</P>
<P>
"She was just sorry I was wrong. I wish I had her on tape now." 
</P>
<P>
That meeting, Tobias recalls, broke the back of his patience. He called the 
California Rural Legal Assistance, a migrant advocacy group, saying he was 
ready to help make this issue a test case. 
</P>
<P>
He was even ready, he told lawyer Claudia Smith, to go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to push this one as far as it would go, but I didn't know how to go 
about it," he recalled. "To me, this is civil rights stuff like the 1960s. I 
thought we were going to have to go out and do something to get carted off to 
jail -- like picking up a worker right in front of a sheriff's deputy." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, however, suggested that Tobias could become part of a lawsuit then being 
prepared by her agency and the ACLU. 
</P>
<P>
The legal assistance lawyer says she wasn't surprised to hear from "sideline" 
people such as Tobias on the hiring issue. "This was another Marjorie Gaines 
special. And like a lot of other things, it went too far. 
</P>
<P>
"For a lot of people, the law just pushed them over the threshold of outrage. 
Peter Tobias was one of them. His outrage was very real." 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday afternoon, Tobias had taken his quest for the right to free speech 
beyond any city council chambers -- straight to a U.S. District courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
He watched as Judge John S. Rhoades not only granted a temporary restraining 
order against the hiring ban, but sounded a ringing defense of the Bill of 
Rights as it applies to all people -- even migrant workers. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Rhoades even quoted from the Pledge of Allegiance as Tobias sat 
beaming in the courtroom, savoring a feeling a vindication, recalling the night 
he had made the same point before City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
"To think that, 2 1/2 years later, a federal judge would be saying largely the 
same thing was great," he said. "It felt great to be able to legitimately say, 
'I told you so.' 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to decide if it was appropriate to applaud. There was just a 
lot of pent-up anger over the city's harsh dealing with people who don't 
deserve that kind of treatment. I mean these migrant workers have more problems 
than any of us have." 
</P>
<P>
So Peter Tobias didn't have to go to jail to make his point. But, as the City 
Council huddles in the next few days to decide its next move, he advises that 
they use caution for once. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure there are a lot of problems caused by huge numbers of poverty-stricken 
people in a community," he said. "But it doesn't matter if they're from Central 
America or Peoria, you can't just enact laws to say they can't look for work on 
city streets. 
</P>
<P>
"They have every right to be there. After all, it's a public place."

MANDELA: STUDENTS FIND SEVERAL WAYS TO SHARE IN ANTI-APARTHEID LEADER'S STAY IN

For many of the children of Los Angeles, these are times of guns in the 
classroom, of gangs, drugs and disillusionment. A time of too few heroes. That 
was why Harold Love was so excited Friday after seeing Nelson Mandela at City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"You sort of felt like you were in medieval times, seeing a king," said Love, 
who at 15 was born too late to know Martin Luther King Jr., and other civil 
rights giants as anything other than history book figures. "In a way, he is: A 
king for his people." 
</P>
<P>
While Mandela came to Los Angeles principally to meet with its movers and 
shakers, moguls and movie stars, there were many in his audience who believed 
his most important accomplishment was simply to stand before the city's 
troubled youngsters as a real-life hero. 
</P>
<P>
Specific visits with youngsters were not on Mandela's Los Angeles schedule, but 
plans had been made to ensure they had opportunities to hear his message. 
Community groups ferried gang members by bus to his speech at the L.A. 
Coliseum. Schoolteachers took their young charges to City Hall. And students 
organized a march on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard to welcome Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to learn, is he true?" said 14-year-old Donte, who lives in a Crenshaw 
District home for minors on probation. "Can he help me? Can I look up to him?" 
</P>
<P>
Friday afternoon, hundreds of students from throughout Southern California 
could be seen walking to the Coliseum from Rancho Cienega Park in Southwest Los 
Angeles carrying banners and chanting slogans to the beat of an African drum 
troop. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the strongest soul of any world leader," said Jacob Pinger, 19, a 
member of the Los Angeles Student Coalition, which organized the nearly 
four-mile youth march along with black, Asian and Latino student organizations 
throughout Los Angeles. "Kids are sick of seeing people elected and then 
selling out as as soon as (the) people forget their promises. 
</P>
<P>
"Mandela," he said, "is a leader that doesn't sell out." 
</P>
<P>
Motorists honked horns and saluted the marchers with upraised fists as they 
moved slowly through the Crenshaw District. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout South Los Angeles and other parts of the city, parents and teachers 
had spent the last few weeks teaching their children about Mandela, to make 
sure his message of hope and dignity was not lost. 
</P>
<P>
At Marcus Garvey School, where black history is as much an educational staple 
as reading and arithmetic, a little girl with auburn-colored corn rows had said 
earlier in the week that she hoped Mandela would bring her a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
"I want Mandela to tell us people shouldn't be in gangs," said 11-year-old 
Amber Mason, "that they are killing up their own people. I hope Mandela would 
change (it), that he'll make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela holds a special significance for many black children, who grew up on 
stories of Selma and Montgomery, bus boycotts and freedom marches, but who were 
born too late to experience them. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of them weren't around when King was living, so (they) don't understand 
the significance of King and Malcolm X," said Louis Sheppard, a co-founder of a 
manhood training program for young black men, who brought 42 students to see 
Mandela speak at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe by hearing Mandela they'll get a more international perspective and 
realize that African-Americans are not an isolated people. They're getting to 
see the problems affecting Africans all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
Sheppard, a history teacher at Palomar Junior High in Pomona, added: "By being 
here, they'll see the closest thing they're ever going to see to Martin Luther 
King Jr. Twenty years from now, when their kids are talking about Mandela, 
they'll be able to say, 'Oh yeah, I remember when.' And it'll make a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
But Mandela's message can transcend color. Young Mi Suh, a 19-year-old 
Korean-American, said that Mandela is also her hero. Like King, she said, his 
fight is for all victims of racism. "And that includes me. That includes the 
color yellow." 
</P>
<P>
She has read much about battles against oppression; of the civil rights 
movement in America and of her own parents' struggles against the Japanese 
occupation of their homeland. But history, she said, means little until you 
feel it for yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"All the great things you hear (about) you have to make personal before it 
means something to you," said Suh. 
</P>
<P>
Not all youngsters were as convinced. Some said bluntly that they saw no 
connection between South-Central and South Africa. They felt they would find 
little inspiration in the words of an elderly man who lived half a world away. 
</P>
<P>
A few did not even know who Mandela was. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was a rapper," admitted Marcus, a former gang member, who first 
heard Mandela's name on a rap-oriented radio station last week. "They were 
saying 'Nelson Mandela will visit' and I said, 'Who is this guy? He must be 
somebody.' " 
</P>
<P>
Marcus, a short, stocky 16-year-old, was one of six teen-agers in a Crenshaw 
District group home being taken to hear Mandela's speech at the Coliseum. 
Officials did not want to his last name published because he is on probation. 
</P>
<P>
Marcus said he didn't believe in heroes. Marcus said he believed a long time 
ago, when he thought supermen could leap buildings in a single bound. But they 
couldn't help him get a job, or give him an alternative to gang life. So he 
dropped them. 
</P>
<P>
"Now," he said, "I'm my own hero."

HOLLYWOOD'S STARS SHINE FOR MANDELA; 
</P>
<P>
VISIT: FAMOUS AND RICH GATHER TO SALUTE SOUTH AFRICAN LEADER. HE URGES 
HOLLYWOOD TO USE TALENTS TO MAKE WORLD A BETTER PLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Nelson Mandela, who spoke earlier in the day of his youthful dreams of 
Hollywood, met with nearly 1,000 of the entertainment capital's legends Friday 
night in a star-studded dinner and reception that swelled the coffers of his 
South African causes. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel humbled in this room," he told the crowd of celebrities, many of whom 
had waited as long as four hours to hear him speak, "and honored by your 
presence." 
</P>
<P>
In an affectionate address that touched repeatedly on the films he saw as a 
youth -- and later as a political prisoner -- Mandela told his audience that 
"you were our window on life outside." 
</P>
<P>
He urged them to fight against apartheid, saying: "In this fight we would like 
all of you to be on our side. With you on our side, we are certain of victory. 
Let us use our creative talents, potential and influence to make our world a 
better place to live in." 
</P>
<P>
And gently chiding the film industry for its early portrayals of black Africans 
as savages, Mandela said he was encouraged by more recent cinematic attempts to 
humanize the image and publicize the South African struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"As a young man," he said, "I remember seeing the films of Tarzan, and being 
uneasy and disturbed . . . . Fortunately over the past few years, a few films 
have sought to partially redress this injustice." 
</P>
<P>
He added that "it is a damning indictment of apartheid that so many years after 
Sidney Poitier starred in the film, 'Cry the Beloved Country, our beloved 
country is still crying." 
</P>
<P>
Poitier was among the 960 actors, film makers, entrepreneurs, politicians and 
activists in attendance at perhaps the most ambitious fund-raising event in 
Mandela's eight-city tour of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The "take" for the event was more than $1.2 million, organizers said. And most 
of it came from the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
Music producer and composer Quincy Jones, who contributed $100,000 to the 
cause, described the long years that Mandela spent in South African jails as a 
harsh payment that most of those in attendance could never fully understand. 
</P>
<P>
"He's put his life and his soul on the line for what he believes in," Jones 
said as he arrived several hours before Mandela's appearance. "I don't know how 
many -- even in this crowd -- would go to prison for 27 years for what they 
believe in." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela strode into the armory of the Museum of Science and Industry at 9 a.m., 
proceeding down a red carpet with an entourage that included his wife, Winnie, 
the Rev. Jesse Jackson and entertainers Jones and Lionel Richie. People in the 
crowd -- among them, Jane Fonda, Kris Kristofferson, Muhammad Ali and dozens of 
other celebrities -- sat back and tapped their feet to the strains of American 
gospel hymns and the music of South Africa's ghettos for more than an hour 
before Mandela spoke. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the presence of hundreds of the famous, the South African leader paused 
briefly to chat with one man without much of a portfolio. He was D. J. Riley, a 
handicapped UCLA law student in a wheelchair. After Mandela continued on his 
way, a beaming Riley said that "I told him I loved him. He said it was very 
nice to meet me and he said he loved me, too." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, it took New York 24 hours and two celebrity fests to drum up $1 
million for Mandela; Los Angeles bested that with advance ticket sales for one 
event, adding up five-figure tax-deductible checks signed by everyone from Arco 
to Zomba Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers declined to reveal the cost of preparations, but sponsors were 
pushing for low overhead decor in the high-ceilinged room. "We'd like all the 
money to go to the ANC," one said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it goes to the Mandela Freedom Fund for education, business and 
communications projects. Another group, Democracy for South Africa, is 
political and contributions to that are not tax deductible. 
</P>
<P>
The Friday night affair was a low-key dinner -- flattened chicken and Caesar 
salad -- with high octane diners. Fitting more than 900 VIPS into the cavernous 
armory required sometimes cramming a dozen people around tables meant for 10, 
people who are not accustomed to being crammed. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the A-ticket crowd, this is the I-want-to-touch-the-hem-of-his-gown 
crowd," bragged advance man Willis Edwards, who has insisted that there be only 
one celebrity on this tour -- Mandela himself. Indeed, the get-close clamor 
prompted the tour's national coordinator, Roger Wilkins, to caution that 
Mandela is "not a movable photo opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
The partial roll call of big contributors read less like they were sponsoring 
Mandela than optioning him: $10,000 each from talent agencies Creative Artists, 
International Creative Management, Triad and William Morris; ditto from ABC 
Entertainment, Columbia Pictures, Fox Broadcasting and Barry Diller, Motown 
Records and Michael Jackson's production company (Jackson asked to have two 
nameless seats held, but didn't say who would fill them); $25,000 each from 
Disney's Jeffrey Katzenberg and Frank Wells, from Ted Fields' Interscope 
Records, from the Marvin Davises. 
</P>
<P>
Other contributors included Gregory Peck, Richard Dreyfuss, Debbie Allen, Danny 
Glover, Harry Belafonte and Mike Tyson. Steven Spielberg and Armand Hammer each 
ponied up $10,000. Some sponsors donated their seats to local African National 
Congress members. 
</P>
<P>
At the close of the affair, Mandela and his wife raised their fists in salute 
as a choir led the glittering Hollywood audience in the unofficial anthem of 
the anti-apartheid movement. Then, walking tall, he left the room of movie 
stars and moguls for the Coliseum, where the masses awaited.

<P>
Signs will be posted warning beach-goers not to swim within 100 yards of where 
the Pico-Kenter storm drain enters Santa Monica Bay as a result of a study that 
found evidence of human viruses from fecal contamination. 
</P>
<P>
High bacteria levels have been found there in the past, but the Santa Monica 
Bay Restoration Project study is the first to detect viruses responsible for 
swimming-associated illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
The viruses were found in samples taken on 11 of 15 days last August and 
September where the Pico-Kenter drain discharges into the bay, at the foot of 
Pico Boulevard in Santa Monica.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-OFFICER SENTENCED FOR FELONY GRAND THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Los Angeles police officer was sentenced Friday to three years in 
prison for swindling $50,000 from a wealthy businessman as part of an alleged 
plot to kill two of the man's associates. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Moser, 30, was arrested after accepting $50,000 from businessman Robert 
Furlong as payment in an alleged plot to kill two of Furlong's business 
associates. 
</P>
<P>
Moser, an officer for three years, was acquitted in September of charges of 
solicitation to commit murder, assault and extortion. Jurors deadlocked 8 to 4 
to convict him of the felony grand theft count, and Moser was then retried on 
that charge and convicted May 24.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GARMENT FIRM HEAD GETS RECORD LOCAL INS 
FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Immigration and Naturalization Service said Friday that it has fined the 
president of a garment manufacturing firm $38,000 for hiring undocumented 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of the fine against Dae Sug Young of Day Young International Inc. is 
a record in the Los Angeles district, the INS said. 
</P>
<P>
Young was indicted by a federal grand jury in May for making a false statement 
to a government agent. The indictment alleged that Young said he had dismissed 
22 undocumented workers, but a subsequent investigation showed that all 22 were 
still working at the company. 
</P>
<P>
Young faces a federal court hearing on the false statement charge July 31.

STORE OWNER SUES CARLSBAD OVER MIGRANT CASE 
</P>

The owner of the Country Store in Carlsbad has filed a $4-million claim against 
the city, alleging that he was falsely arrested by police officers in 
connection with the January abduction of a 27-year-old Mexican migrant worker. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey Ryberg, the older brother of Randy Ryberg -- convicted earlier this 
month of misdemeanor false imprisonment in the case -- also claims that he was 
slandered during his arrest at another convenience store he owns. 
</P>
<P>
Ryberg was initially arrested Jan. 3 along with his brother, a baker and food 
wholesaler at the Country Store, in connection with the unlawful detainment of 
Candido Gayosso Salas as he sought work in the parking lot outside the store. 
</P>
<P>
Both men were released shortly after their arrest. The district attorney's 
office subsequently declined to pursue charges against Rickey Ryberg. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Ryberg and William Zimmerman, a self-employed meat cutter at the Country 
Store, were tried in Vista Superior Court earlier this month for the incident, 
in which Gayosso was handcuffed to a store railing for more than two hours, 
then tied and hooded with a paper bag that read "No Mas Aqui," or No More Here. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Ryberg, originally charged with felony false imprisonment, was convicted 
of a reduced charge. Zimmerman was acquitted on all charges. 
</P>
<P>
Rickard Borg, a Carlsbad attorney representing the Country Store, said Friday 
that one $2-million claim alleges that Ryberg was arrested without probable 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
The second claim, also for $2 million, alleges that a Carlsbad police officer 
entered a local convenience store also owned by Rickey Ryberg and made 
slanderous statements in front of two store employees. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad City Atty. Vince Biondo could not be reached for comment.

PORTER RANCH AFTERMATH: VICTIMS OF THE DECEMBER, 1988, BLAZE KNOW ALL TOO WELL 
WHAT THOSE OF THE SANTA BARBARA AND GLENDALE DISASTERS ARE ENDURING.

<P>
Sindhu Sidharta has been waiting nearly eight weeks for his front door to be 
delivered by contractors, and on Friday his daily vigil at his house's 
construction site ended in disappointment yet again. Still no door. 
</P>
<P>
It was just one more delay in more than 18 months of delays in his life and the 
rebuilding of his house since Dec. 9, 1988, when a devastating fire swept out 
of the hills north of Porter Ranch and through Sidharta's neighborhood on 
Beaufait Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Sidharta's home was one of 40 de stroyed or damaged. And his family is one of 
only three whose residences are still not ready. 
</P>
<P>
As the rebuilding of Beaufait Avenue nears completion, the neighborhood offers 
a telling look at what is in store for the victims of this week's disastrous 
fires that cut an awesome path of destruction through Glendale and Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
When Sidharta grew tired of waiting for the front door to be delivered Friday 
and left the construction site for the rented house where his family 
temporarily lives, he held his frustration in check. He had things in 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"At least I am close to the end of all of this," he said wearily. "The worst is 
over. But for those poor people. . . . It is so sad. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what they are going through. And they probably have no idea what is 
ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Although the Beaufait Avenue neighborhood is 20 years old, the 12000 through 
12300 blocks, where the most fire damage took place, looks like part of a new 
housing development. Several houses are new. Others have gleaming new tile 
roofs. A few are still under construction, while landscaping is being completed 
on others. 
</P>
<P>
But the rebirth of the neighborhood does not show the pain of the struggle to 
rebuild. The victims of the Porter Ranch fire said the road back to normalcy 
has been hard and is not yet completed. After one night of high wind and fire, 
they found themselves in a whirlwind of insurance agents and adjusters, 
building contractors, inspectors and the media. 
</P>
<P>
"It is such a tough time right after being a victim of that kind of disaster," 
said Eric Struthoff, whose family's house and belongings were destroyed. He and 
his wife and two daughters finally moved back into their rebuilt house this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
"You are thrown into an arena you are not familiar with," Struthoff said. 
"There are so many decisions. You have to deal with insurance. You have to be 
careful what contractor to use. You have to find a rental house. These are 
decisions that are difficult enough to make under even normal circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
"And, meantime, you have to carry on everyday activities like your business, 
your children's schooling. It becomes a full-time job in itself." 
</P>
<P>
For some families the tortuous wait to return to their neighborhood lasted only 
six months. Others are still waiting. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all faced delays of one kind or another. Brian and Marlene Oliver went 
through four insurance adjusters. Sidharta spent seven months negotiating with 
his insurance company before he could even begin to plan the rebuilding of his 
house. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very confusing and there are always delays -- even in getting something 
like a front door," Sidharta said. "You have to deal with it piece by piece. 
And you have to watch over everything if you want it done right." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Friedman says she is one of the lucky ones because her family moved into a 
rebuilt house just six months after the fire. Although there were no insurance 
or contractor snags, she still refers to the fire and the rebuilding process as 
a "nightmare followed by a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
"Once the initial shock wears off there are larger problems," she said. "We 
lost everything. We had to start completely over." 
</P>
<P>
During the recovery process, the residents drew closely together -- bound by 
the shared experience of the fire and the belief that outsiders could not fully 
understand their loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people said, 'Aren't you excited that you have the opportunity to build a 
new house and buy new things, new furniture?' " Struthoff recalled. "But the 
answer is no. You would rather have the old back." 
</P>
<P>
Friedman, her husband and two sons moved into a rebuilt house that was designed 
exactly the way they had wished the original had been. But surrounded by new 
furnishings and new appliances, they did not feel at home for several months. 
They were missing a lifetime of belongings -- keepsakes that physically 
connected them to their pasts. 
</P>
<P>
"As time goes on, it gets better," Friedman said. "It finally feels like home 
to me now." 
</P>
<P>
As the neighborhood finally completes its rebirth, the neighbors have kept 
their close bonds. Those friendships are counted among the few positive results 
of the fire. There have been several block parties on Beaufait over the past 18 
months, and the residents will gather again on the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
The relationships help repair emotional scars left by the fire, which for many 
have lasted far longer than the property damage. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, when fires raged in Glendale and Santa Barbara, the haunting 
memory of Dec. 9, 1988, came back to many. Neighbors gathered in the street to 
talk about the fire. Some called the Fire Department after seeing smoke, only 
to be told the fire danger was miles away. 
</P>
<P>
"These latest fires were much more horrendous, but it brought back the memory," 
Struthoff said. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't forget." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Friedman said she sat in her new house watching television reports on the 
fires and started crying. The next day she called the Red Cross in Glendale and 
gave her name and phone number. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them that if any of those people want to talk to someone who went 
through this, I'm here," Friedman said. "I just want to tell them, 'You will 
get through this, even though it doesn't seem like you ever will.' "

COUNCIL PUTS S. AFRICA QUESTION ON BALLOT AS A 'GIFT' TO MANDELA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a gesture of support for Nelson Mandela, the Los Angeles City Council came 
to work early Friday and decided to place before voters a proposal that would 
toughen the city's anti-apartheid measures by banning nearly all city contracts 
with firms that do business with South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously for the proposed change at a special 8:30 a.m. 
meeting, ordering the city attorney's office to draft a ballot measure that is 
expected to go before the voters in November. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for an amendment to the City Charter that would disqualify 
companies and individuals from bidding on city contracts if they have business 
ties with South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"This city has always stood for individual freedom and human rights," said 
Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who sponsored the proposal with Councilman 
Robert Farrell. Flores called the proposal "a gift . . . we can give to Mr. 
Mandela to take back with him to the people of South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
An ordinance approved in 1986 imposed a partial South African ban that applied 
largely to contracts of $25,000 or less -- about 10% of the contracts granted 
by the city. The city awards about $296 million in contracts each year, but 
only $27 million worth fall under the current ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The new proposal, first made last September, languished in a City Council 
committee for nine months, but was revived last Monday and quickly sent to the 
full council in time for it to be passed just hours before Mandela arrived at 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
If the voters approve the Charter amendment, it would affect some of the 
country's largest businesses, including IBM Corp., General Motors Corp., Xerox 
Corp. and General Electric Co., all of which bid on and hold contracts with the 
city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Ott, a Los Angeles spokesman for General Motors, said that the company and 
its chairman, Roger Smith, have long had a "major commitment" to the use of 
economic sanctions against the South African government. He said that GM had no 
comment Friday on the action taken by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for IBM said the company could not comment until it had a chance to 
study the language of the proposed charter change. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to reach spokesmen for the other companies were unsuccessful Friday. 
</P>
<P>
No company representatives spoke against the proposed ballot measure during the 
brief council debate. 
</P>
<P>
The four companies have sold off their South African subsidiaries, but all 
still have distribution or licensing agreements in South Africa, which would 
make them ineligible to bid on contracts under the proposed measure. 
</P>
<P>
Although the vote was unanimous Friday, there was a brief period of controversy 
as Councilman Nate Holden complained that too many exemptions had been granted 
over the last four years. The 1986 ordinance has been amended twice to cut down 
on exemptions, but some are still necessary, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The council has approved 13 exemptions since 1986 and city departments have 
granted 1,200, according to George Wolfberg, who works in the city 
administrative office. 
</P>
<P>
Wolfberg told the council that the most recent exemptions have gone to the 
Salvation Army for a homeless project, to two banks that would have been 
disqualified under a "technicality" because they had old, outstanding loans to 
South African ventures, and to the owners of some property where the Fire 
Department needed to place signal relaying equipment.

LINDSAY COLLAPSES BEFORE CHANCE TO GREET MANDELA; 
</P>
<P>
ILLNESS: THE 89-YEAR-OLD COUNCILMAN WAS STRICKEN IN CITY HALL GARAGE. HE IS 
BEING TREATED IN CRITICAL CARE UNIT OF WHITE MEMORIAL MEDICAL CENTER.

Los Angeles City Councilman Gilbert Lindsay collapsed in the City Hall garage 
early Friday just hours before he was to greet Nelson Mandela, an aide said. 
The 89-year-old councilman was taken to a hospital, where his condition was 
later reported as stable. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay's collapse was described by an aide as a fainting spell, which was 
blamed on a combination of excitement over the day's festivities, his skipping 
of breakfast and the recent spate of hot weather. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela was told of Lindsay's collapse by Mayor Tom Bradley. The South African 
anti-apartheid leader was said to have expressed a desire to visit the 
councilman, but did not, apparently because of his schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay was being treated in the critical care unit at White Memorial Medical 
Center, hospital officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, what a touching story," the mayor quoted Mandela as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay was rushed to the hospital after he "basically fainted" shortly after 9 
a.m., according to his aide, Bob Gay. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay, whose health has been failing since he suffered a stroke in 1988, was 
getting out of his car with his driver when he had a dizzy spell and collapsed, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics already standing by for the Mandela event rushed to the councilman's 
side, gave him oxygen and transported him to the medical center, where an hour 
later he was "barking orders, playing with nurses" and trying to figure a way 
to get back to City Hall to shake Mandela's hand, Gay said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's senior councilman and self-described "Emperor of the 9th District," 
Lindsay was to have greeted Mandela at the end of the red carpet unfurled on 
the City Hall steps. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay, who rarely makes it to a council meeting before 11 a.m., was hurrying 
to a special 8:30 a.m. session where an anti-apartheid ordinance was rushed 
into law in time for Mandela's arrival. Lindsay had already missed the meeting 
when he collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have breakfast. He was excited about making it to the City Council 
meeting," Gay said. "He didn't have a stroke. He never lost consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
But the attack was serious enough to warrant further tests, doctors decided, 
dashing the councilman's chance to meet the civil rights leader with whom he is 
said to feel a special affinity. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay rose from a childhood in segregated Mississippi to become the city's 
first black councilman 27 years ago -- almost precisely the same time Mandela 
was imprisoned. 
</P>
<P>
"Councilman Lindsay wanted to say hello," Gay said. "He is going to miss that 
opportunity -- or Mr. Mandela is going to miss that opportunity -- depending on 
how you look at it. Mr. Mandela probably hasn't met too many 89-year-old 
elected officials."

MANDELA'S VISIT TO L.A.;

<P>
TUTU VISITS PREPARED WAY FOR MANDELA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Although black South African leaders Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela are united 
in their insistence that economic sanctions against the government of their 
country must continue, there have been differences in their styles, missions 
and receptions during visits to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu, the jovial, peace-talking Anglican archbishop who preceded political 
leader Mandela's visit by almost two months, has been cast in a kind of "John 
the Baptist" role, an advance man for Mandela's reception as a world-class 
superhero. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu "helped prepare the way for Mandela," said Edmond Browning, the presiding 
bishop of the Episcopal Church. "He has held up the moral and ethical issues of 
apartheid. Now, Mandela can come in with the necessary political skills and 
influence" with the U.S. government, Browning said. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu, 58, who heads the Anglican Church in the Province of Southern Africa, has 
often come to the United States, including his recent 10-day visit to Southern 
California. His trips here are primarily to speak in churches and at 
universities and to raise scholarship money so disadvantaged black African 
youths can study at U.S. universities. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, 71, a Methodist layman and deputy president of the African National 
Congress, is making his first U.S. visit and Tuesday became the first black 
private citizen to ever address a joint session of the U.S. Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Those who know both men say the difference in their messages is in nuance 
rather than substance. 
</P>
<P>
"Both have a vision for justice and a truly nonracial charter of freedom for 
their country," said Brian Sellers-Petersen, director of the Center for South 
African Ministry, an arm of All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"Mandela talks in political terms against the supremacy of either black or 
white . . . Tutu talks in the same way but in more theological terms . . . 
about the humanity of God and his reflected glory in us," Sellers-Petersen 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Ridley-Thomas of the Los Angeles office of the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference noted that both Tutu and Mandela are students of 
liberation theology -- Tutu from the theoretical perspective and "Mandela from 
a jail cell, which gives you a very different cut on it." 
</P>
<P>
Tutu, a diminutive figure with a hint of impishness often glowing from his 
eyes, is given to flowery descriptions, effusive expressions and ready wit. 
</P>
<P>
When a stained glass window bearing his likeness was unveiled at an Altadena 
church last month, he appreciatively joked that he was "tongue-tied" -- an 
affliction, he said, "many in the South African government wish would be 
permanent." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, also charismatic, generates excitement in a quiet way. He speaks 
bluntly, softly and often in a lilting South African accent. A lawyer by 
training, he usually reads his speeches, stands very erect and greets people 
with a calm, dignified manner. 
</P>
<P>
The two African leaders, who have been close friends over the years, are not 
far apart on their views about armed struggle, according to associates. 
</P>
<P>
The politically savvy Mandela locked horns with the White House Monday when he 
politely but firmly told President Bush that he would not renounce the use of 
violence if other efforts failed to end white domination of his country. 
</P>
<P>
Though in his speeches Tutu has concentrated on the renunciation of violence, 
"he understands it," said the Rev. George Regas, rector of All Saints in 
Pasadena and a longtime Tutu friend.

<P>
Pausing from his exhausting schedule Friday night, Nelson Mandela met with 
another famed political prisoner, former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky, to 
exchange views over the South African leader's controversial embrace of 
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
After a half-hour session at the Biltmore, which Sharansky later described as a 
"very warm meeting," the men briefly emerged from Mandela's quarters on the 
sixth floor of the hotel, smiled, and posed for news photographers. 
</P>
<P>
Sharansky, 42, who emigrated to Israel after he was released by Soviet 
authorities in 1986 after spending 8 1/2 years in prison, said the two men 
parted over Arafat but agreed that "the struggle for human rights is universal, 
international and applies to all the countries." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela was released from prison in February after being held for 27 years. 
</P>
<P>
Sharansky flew from New York to Los Angeles to see Mandela in a meeting 
arranged by Jewish leaders concerned about Mandela's continuing support for 
Arafat and other Arab heads of state. 
</P>
<P>
During a meeting between Jewish leaders and the South African leader in Geneva 
on June 10, Mandela mentioned that he had read "Fear No Evil," Sharansky's 
account of his life in a Soviet prison. Afterward, the Jewish leaders urged 
Sharansky to talk with Mandela and seek common ground between the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the men agreed to disagree. "He agreed with the principal (of Israeli 
concerns about Arafat) but he did not agree that Mr. Arafat wants to destroy 
the state of Israel," Sharansky said.

SUBWAY BILL UNDER FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Governor Deukmejian should veto Senate Bill 1263, the Robbins Subway Bill. 
</P>
<P>
This bill would benefit only a very vocal minority in the San Fernando Valley. 
The tremendous cost of this type of project compared to other forms of rail 
transit would be an unwarranted tax burden on the general public. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Robbins is totally out of touch with reality in this matter. The advisory 
vote confirms this. Only 10% of the vote went for the subway.

<P>
Jones spent more than 20 years in show business, doubling for Charles Bronson 
in "From Noon Till Three" and Roddy McDowall in "Planet of the Apes" and 
performing stunts in television's "The Mod Squad" and "Hill Street Blues," 
among dozens of other credits. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a Chatsworth resident, died Wednesday of lung disease, said his wife, 
Susan Jones. 
</P>
<P>
He was born John A. Jones on May 8, 1930, in Shreveport, La., where he was 
raised on a ranch. A singer and guitar player, Jones toured in bands with 
Johnny Horton and Hank Williams Sr., playing in Nashville, Las Vegas and Los 
Angeles, his wife said. Both men were his brothers-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
A few years after moving to Los Angeles in the late 1950s, he met stuntmen Hal 
Needham and Tony Epper while playing at a club on San Fernando Road, Needham 
said. Jones practiced Western stunts, including fights and high falls, in 
Needham's back yard under the supervision of both stuntmen. In exchange, Jones 
gave them guitar lessons, Needham said. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' knowledge of horsemanship helped land him stunt work and small acting 
roles in TV's "Bonanza" and "The Wild Wild West." In 1987, Louisiana Gov. Edwin 
W. Edwards acknowledged his accomplishments with the Governor's Award. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 30 years; daughters Shawn, Sheryl and Kimberly 
Jones, all of Chatsworth; mother, Mary L. Jones of Shreveport, La. ; a brother, 
Al Jones of Woodland Hills, and a sister, Billie Jean Horton of Shreveport. 
</P>
<P>
A service is scheduled for 11 a.m. today at J.T. Oswald Mortuary Chapel, 6944 
Reseda Blvd., in Reseda, which is handling the arrangements. Burial will follow 
at Oakwood Memorial Park in Chatsworth.

ROBERT C. SHERMAN; SINGER'S FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert C. Sherman, who for two decades delivered milk to Woodland Hills 
residents and was the father of teen singing idol Bobby Sherman, has died in 
Sepulveda. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
He died June 23 of a heart attack after suffering for years from emphysema, 
said his wife, Juanita Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
Born Nov. 28, 1919, in Chicago, Sherman came to Los Angeles when he was 16 and 
worked as an usher at a movie theater. In 1943, he began delivering milk for 
Arden Farms in Beverly Hills but shortly afterward was drafted into the U.S. 
Army, serving less than a year because of health problems. Sherman returned to 
his former occupation and moved to Van Nuys in 1951, when he began delivering 
milk throughout San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, he launched his own milk delivery service called Woodland 
Hills Dairy. Rising at 3:30 every morning, Sherman delivered milk to about 
1,000 customers in Woodland Hills. He retired in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s he built a soundproof practice room in his home for his son, 
who went on to record hits including "Hey, Little Woman" and "Easy Come, Easy 
Go" in the late '60s and early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Sherman is survived by his wife of 52 years; son Bobby of Encino; a 
daughter, Darlene Mack of Hollywood, Md.; brothers, Herbert J. Sherman and 
William Sherman of Oroville; six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. A 
private service and burial are planned. 
</P>
<P>
Aftercare Funeral Service in Van Nuys is handling the arrangements. Donations 
can be made in Sherman's name to the American Lung Assn. of Los Angeles County 
or the American Heart Assn., Northwestern Division.

NEA REJECTS GRANTS FOR 4 PERFORMANCE ARTISTS; 
</P>
<P>
ARTS: THE MOVE IS CONDEMNED AS POLITICAL APPEASEMENT. THE ENDOWMENT'S CHAIRMAN 
PERSONALLY INTERVENED IN THE GRANT SELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unprecedented action, the National Endowment for the Arts on Friday 
turned down fellowship grants to four controversial performance artists -- but 
awarded money to 14 others. 
</P>
<P>
The move seemed certain to ignite a raging new protest within the nation's arts 
community where the grant-rejection decision was immediately condemned as an 
attempt by the NEA to appease its political opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The action by NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer came after weeks of rumors and 
speculation over the fate of 18 solo-performance fellowship grants that entered 
the NEA controversy in early May. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the endowment's advisory board voted to delay a decision on 
whether to approve the grants in the wake of attacks by conservative columnists 
and print journalists on the content of work produced by feminist New York 
performance artist Karen Finley, one of the recommended fellows. 
</P>
<P>
The issue had also attracted the attention of an internal NEA theater overview 
panel, which urged Frohnmayer to resist growing political pressures -- which, 
according to sources familiar with the situation, came both from the White 
House and Congress -- to reject the grants. 
</P>
<P>
Those whose grant were rejected include Finley and performers Holly Hughes of 
New York City, John Fleck of Los Angeles and Tim Miller of Santa Monica. 
Finley, Hughes and Fleck had previously been targeted publicly by NEA 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The appearance on the rejection list of Miller, an anti-AIDS activist whose 
work includes strongly political elements, was something of a surprise. Miller 
said he believed he may have gotten on the rejection list because a personal 
statement he filed with his application attacked Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), a 
leader of the anti-NEA forces in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Miller said, "Look here, Sen. Jesse Helms, keep your porky 
pig face out of the NEA." 
</P>
<P>
In a statement announcing the names of the 14 winners of the fellowships, the 
NEA acknowledged that Frohnmayer had taken the extraordinary step of 
intervening in the fellowship situation after the May meeting of the National 
Council on the Arts voted to defer action on the grants until early August. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a spokesman for Helms issued a "no comment" statement on the NEA 
announcement Friday. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), another leader of 
conservative opponents of the NEA in Congress, did not respond to requests for 
a statement. In the past, Rohrabacher had condemned the content of work of some 
of the artists in question, including Finley, whose performances have sometimes 
included segments in which she appears on stage naked from the waist up, 
smeared with chocolate and covered with alfalfa sprouts. 
</P>
<P>
The costuming, Finley has said, is intended to symbolize various aspects of the 
oppression of women. Finley, Hughes, Fleck and Miller have all been extensively 
reviewed by critics across the country and are uniformly perceived as prominent 
artists in their medium. Miller received an NEA choreography fellowship last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview from her home near New York City, Finley said she 
learned of her fellowship rejection Friday in a fax from the NEA. 
</P>
<P>
"I am being punished because I am a morally concerned artist," Finley said. "We 
as a nation are now in an era of blacklisting, as during the 1950s, called 
McCarthyism. Today is a sad regressive day in our national history. Today 
begins an era of American history not strong in its cultural diversity, but 
weak in not allowing our cultural diversity a right to speak. 
</P>
<P>
"Those who have written libelous articles on me have never seen me perform. Is 
Mr. Frohnmayer listening to those who have not seen me and not listening the 
peer panel that recommended me and knows my work? Nor does he listen to the 
many positive, thorough reviews of my work. This is the man who is in charge of 
the National Endowment for the Arts?" 
</P>
<P>
Reached at her home in New York, Hughes said she had been rejected twice before 
for NEA grants -- because, she contended, she is a politically activist 
lesbian. "I think that Frohnmayer is bowing to political pressure from a 
far-right minority that thinks they can redirect the hatred and prejudice that 
used to be directed at people's color and . . . at Jews in Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they think it's open season on feminists and openly gay artists. Since my 
work is very popular, I'm saying he's going to lose. People are not going to 
allow these artists to be blacklisted. We're just the scapegoats du jour. 
Wasn't our government founded on the principle of freedom of expression, 
including Holly Hughes and Jesse Helms? They're not just censoring me, they're 
censoring my audiences." 
</P>
<P>
The endowment and sources familiar with the situation said that Frohnmayer 
began early last week to poll the 24 members of the council individually and 
that the chairman sent the council members materials describing the work of the 
18 proposed fellows. As a result of the poll, said an NEA statement, 14 of the 
18 grants were approved. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, The Times learned that two of the rejected fellowship applicants 
have also been recommended by a different NEA review panel for grants under 
still another NEA program. Those grants are expected to come up for 
consideration by the National Council on the Arts at its scheduled early 
August. It was not certain which two artists or what NEA program was involved. 
The endowment statement was silent on the simultaneous action rejecting the 
remaining four applicants. "Long-standing endowment policy precludes the agency 
from commenting publicly regarding any application rejected in any category," 
the NEA said. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Arnoult, chairman of the NEA review panel that screened 90 applications 
for solo performance fellowships and recommended the 18 proposed winners, said 
Frohnmayer notified him of the decision to approve 14 grants and reject four 
about noon Friday. Arnoult is founder and artistic director of the Theatre 
Project in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that Mr. Frohnmayer has taken what he believes to be the only 
action open to him," said Arnoult. "I believe that the decision on these four 
artists was based on perceived political realities. But I disagree with that 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"The larger debate on these issues will take place in Congress over the next 
weeks and I am personally saddened by the politicization of support for the 
arts in this country. I believe that terrible damage has already been done to 
these artists and to the endowment itself." 
</P>
<P>
The announcement by the endowment came two days after Frohnmayer reportedly 
intimated the decision to reject grants in an attempt to thwart political 
opposition. On Wednesday, Frohnmayer met with 12 community arts leaders in 
Seattle. He reportedly told the closed gathering that the status of the 18 
performance fellowships was under review in an attempt to contain the 
controversy over the NEA and pacify Helms and other conservatives in Congress 
while stemming growing concern in the White House over the NEA crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Reaction to the NEA announcement within the arts community was immediate and 
overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
"The chairman (Frohnmayer) and others are in essence acting to quote, save the 
endowment," said David Chambers, a Yale School of Drama professor who is chair 
of the NEA's prestigious theater overview panel that urged Frohnmayer not to 
cave in to political opposition to the grants earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
"The question really arises, 'What are we saving here?' To see (these grant 
recommendations) overturned is, indeed, disturbing," said Chambers, who is also 
an associate artist with the South Coast Repertory Theater in Costa Mesa. "One 
has to wonder about the overall expediency of these political actions." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Wyatt, director of the New York gallery Artists Space, which was the 
focus of an NEA controversy last year over Frohnmayer's abortive attempt to 
cancel a grant for an AIDS-related art show, condemned the grant-rejection 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, Frohnmayer revoked a $10,000 grant to Artists Space in the midst 
of a raging controversy over the overtly political and sexual content of some 
of the work in the show, "Witnesses: Against Our Vanishing." But when a 
counter-protest developed in the arts community, Frohnmayer recognized the 
situation threatened to tear the endowment apart and restored the money within 
a few days after revoking it. 
</P>
<P>
"I discovered that, with Mr. Frohnmayer, that the withdrawal of a grant is a 
mistake and he recognized that it was a mistake (at the time) and that one 
thing about an error is that it can be corrected," Wyatt said. "Clearly, the 
basis of this decision that he obviously felt he had no options, or very few 
options. He seems to be basing his decisions on the same rationale for 
withdrawing our grant -- which was the current political climate. That is no 
basis for a decision about a grant. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that he is igniting a powder keg. He is buying into a panic mentality 
and scare tactics." 
</P>
<P>
"Political expediency is a horrible way to make judgments about art and the 
public's access to it," said Charlotte Murphy, executive director of the 
Washington-based National Assn. of Artist Organizations. "These artists are 
being punished for having their names appear in the press. It is as simple and 
chilling as that." 
</P>
<P>
"I clearly feel that, on this issue, artists are the ones being the moral 
leaders," said David Mendoza, director of Artists Trust, a Seattle arts group.

KPFK IN HOT WATER AGAIN WITH '1965'?; 
</P>
<P>
RADIO: THE STATION WANTS TO AVOID A CONFRONTATION WITH THE FCC OVER JOHN 
WATSON'S PSYCHOSEXUAL DRAMA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For John G. Watson, his semi-autobiographical, one-person radio drama, "1965," 
is a painful but therapeutic attempt to come to grips with the traumas of his 
childhood and the turmoil that marked his life as a gay teen-ager during the 
beginnings of the hippie era. 
</P>
<P>
But for KPFK-FM (90.7), "1965" represents something more -- a controversial 
program about a sexual issue that could get the station into more hot water 
with the Federal Communications Commission. The station is still smarting from 
being reprimanded for indecency by the FCC over the August, 1986 airing of 
"Jerker," a play that contained four-letter words and explicit descriptions of 
homosexual acts. 
</P>
<P>
So the station ran the program by its attorneys. The question was not whether 
"1965" should go on the air -- it is a comparatively mild drama with none of 
the profanity and sexual descriptions of "Jerker" -- but whether it could be 
broadcast early enough to reach the young people for whom it is intended. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers gave the go-ahead to air it Sunday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"The specific descriptions of sexual activity were pretty mild and the language 
was tame," said KPFK program director Lucia Chappelle. "But since the whole 
play is the psychosexual biography of one person, we were concerned about what 
the FCC's reaction to it would be." 
</P>
<P>
She said that there appeared to be "a lot of homophobia" in the FCC's opinions 
on what is considered offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Watson's play, which he wrote and performed, is a monologue by an awkward and 
troubled gay 18-year-old who committed suicide in 1965. He comes back from the 
grave to comment on the events that led to the suicide. He ultimately concludes 
that suicide is wrong, and that he killed himself for the wrong reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of gay teen-age suicide is largely ignored by the mainstream media, 
said Watson, who went through his own suicidal period in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
More than grappling with his homosexuality, the narrator of "1965" is dealing 
with larger issues he can't understand -- an abusive, alcoholic father, a 
dysfunctional family, the inability of close friends who are straight to deal 
with his homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted it to air at an early hour," the 43-year-old Watson said. "Sure, 
there are some references to sex and drugs, but that's just a normal part of 
adolescent life. It's dealing with issues that are crucial for adolescents to 
understand." 
</P>
<P>
Chappelle and other officials agreed, but it wasn't quite that easy to put 
"1965" on at an early hour. 
</P>
<P>
David Salniker, executive director of the nonprofit Pacifica Broadcasting, 
KPFK's parent organization, said that federal actions over the past three years 
have left no official "safe harbor" for airing programs with sexual references 
or descriptions. "It used to be (that) those programs would have to be aired 
after 10 p.m.," he said. "Then it was after midnight. But now it's unsure." 
</P>
<P>
Pacifica is awaiting the FCC's decision next month on whether it will enforce a 
law approved by Congress in 1987 that would put a 24-hour ban on indecent 
broadcasts. The legislation, initiated by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), calls for 
penalties of a $10,000 fine and the possibility of two years' imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it is our job to review all the material that might come under the FCC's 
definition of obscenity, which puts us in a real impossible position," Salniker 
said. "It makes us censors, particularly in the presention of poetry and 
dramatic works. We never put on shock jocks or titillating material." 
</P>
<P>
On April 16, 1987, the FCC announced that KPFK violated broadcast decency 
standards by broadcasting "Jerker," and asked the Justice Department to 
prosecute Pacifica. The Justice Department decided against such action. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, KPFK has been sensitive about reviewing materials that might be 
considered offensive by the FCC. But station attorneys felt that "1965" would 
not be considered indecent. 
</P>
<P>
"They said it fit within the guidelines, and they would be surprised if there 
was one complaint," Chappelle said. "That's good, because this needs to be on 
at a time when young people can hear it." 
</P>
<P>
The hourlong program will air during a day of KPFK's annual celebration of gay 
pride, and will be followed by a panel discussion hosted by Watson on gay teen 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
Watson said that he was pleased with the decision to air the program at 8 p.m: 
"Doing this program was very important for me in dealing with important issues, 
and I really want it to be heard by as many young people as possible."

AID FOR DEVASTATED LEBANESE ARMENIANS SOUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
FUND RAISING: THE LEADER OF AN ARM OF THE APOSTOLIC CHURCH IS IN THE SOUTHLAND 
SEEKING HELP FOR HIS PEOPLE.

<P>
The spiritual leader of one arm of the Armenian Apostolic Church came to 
Southern California this week to highlight the devastation of his community in 
Lebanon and to ask local Armenians for their help. 
</P>
<P>
Karekin II said the situation in East Beirut, where the Armenian Apostolic 
Church of Cilicia is based, has been overshadowed by ethnic unrest in the 
Soviet Union and by the earthquake that struck Soviet Armenia in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people in the Armenian community have been caught in the 
cross-fire of the Lebanese civil war, the patriarch said, though not many 
people know about their struggle. "In the last four months things have become 
so tragic that people in the United States must be made aware of the 
situation," he said. "We have reached a stage of crisis." 
</P>
<P>
Although Karekin II did not say how much money he hoped to raise during his 
American visit, a report issued by the Armenian prelacy of Lebanon said about 
$600,000 a month is needed to help the Armenian families most severely affected 
by the shelling. The same report said about 30 Armenians have died in the last 
three months as a result of the fighting. There are about 175,000 Armenians in 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"There is scarcity of food, most of the homes have been damaged significantly, 
there is no electricity, no running water, schools have closed and businesses 
have been disrupted," the 58-year-old patriarch said during an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Karekin II, who is the highest Armenian Church official outside of the Soviet 
Union, began his five-day trip Tuesday with prayers and an address to about 400 
Armenians at St. Garabed Armenian Church in Hollywood. Dressed in traditional 
black and purple robes, he also visited churches in Encino and Montebello and 
will end his West Coast tour Sunday with a Holy Mass at St. Mary's Armenian 
Church in Glendale. Most of Southern California's estimated 300,000 Armenians 
live in Hollywood, Glendale and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"His Holiness' visit is very important to Armenians here," said Berdj 
Karapetian, executive director of the Armenian National Committee, an umbrella 
group for the community. "For Armenians the church is not just a religion. It 
is a national church. It is how Armenian people identify as Armenians." 
</P>
<P>
The Armenian Church claims about 7 million members worldwide. Most Armenians 
fled their native homeland, present-day Eastern Turkey, after a massacre by the 
Turks in 1915. Diaspora Armenians live in Soviet Armenia, the Middle East, 
Europe, the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Karekin II said that despite Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of 
restructuring, commonly known as perestroika, the flow of immigrants from the 
Soviet Union to the United States is expected to continue at the present level 
of between 10,000 to 15,000 people a year -- 90% of whom settle in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The church, for its part, discourages immigration. "It is not only hardship why 
people are leaving," he said. "It is the American way of life that leads them 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them they have to stay and accept the challenge," the prelate 
continued. "We are in our motherland and we have a chance to be masters of our 
own life and to reach our aspiration of freedom and independence." 
</P>
<P>
Karekin II said that although the plight of Armenians in Lebanon is his top 
priority during this visit, other issues, including ethnic violence in the 
Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia are of great concern to the church. 
</P>
<P>
For the last 2 1/2 years most of the violence in that region has been in the 
enclave of Nagorno-Karabagh, which has a majority population of Armenian 
Christians, but is under the administrative control of Muslim Azerbaijanis. 
Several hundred people have died in clashes over the disputed territory since 
February, 1988, when massive Armenian demonstrations demanding an end to 
Azerbaijani control of Nagorno-Karabagh were answered by violent 
counterdemonstrations in Azerbaijan. 
</P>
<P>
When Gorbachev came to the United States last month for summit talks, he was 
trailed by Armenian demonstrators demanding that he take more action to help 
Armenians in Nagorno-Karabagh obtain self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Armenian Church is considered a single entity, it has been divided 
by geographic jurisdictions and political differences for the last 35 years. 
But the suffering of the Armenian people has brought an end to the internecine 
conflict, Karekin II said. He recently reconciled with Catholicos Vazken I, 
head of the Holy See of Etchmiadzin in Soviet Armenia, known as the Catholicos 
of All Armenians. 
</P>
<P>
The two religious leaders of the Armenian Church have met several times in the 
last five years. Most recently, they each signed a letter to U.N. 
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar calling for a recognition of the 
"legitimate rights of the Armenian people." Last month the two leaders jointly 
consecrated a new Armenian Church in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
"We realized that we have higher goals which are more important than our 
differences," Karekin II said. "We can not act separately. We have entered a 
new line of policy to work together. We have to face challenges as one church 
and one nation." 
</P>
<P>
Karekin II also discussed new religious freedoms in the Soviet Union brought 
about by glasnost. The pontiff said that after years of religious persecution, 
Armenians are rediscovering their religion. Thousands of Armenian churches have 
reopened in the Soviet Union, and 26 ancient churches have reopened in Soviet 
Armenia, the patriarch said.

The director and news editor of the Southern Baptist Convention's news service 
say they have been told to resign or be "dealt with harshly." 
</P>
<P>
Al Shackleford and Dan Martin said they were given the ultimatum at their 
Nashville office June 19 by the Rev. Harold C. Bennett, president of the 
convention's Executive Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The two journalists, who went public with the news a week later, said they were 
told if they resigned quietly they would be continued on the payroll through 
the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
"They've redefined the terms of objective reporting to mean they want to tell 
their story their way, and anyone with another opinion is a troublemaker," said 
Martin, the news editor. 
</P>
<P>
Shackleford said the committee is making "an attempt to control the right and 
responsibility of Baptist church members to know what's happening in their 
denomination." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
For the last five years, Baptist Press has been under fire from fundametalists 
for an alleged imbalance in reporting on developments in the denomination's 
theological-political controversy.

STATION MANAGERS ARE UPBEAT ON CBS PILOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A team of CBS executives, led by chief executive Laurence Tisch as pitcher, 
lost a softball game against a team of CBS station managers Thursday night at 
Dodger Stadium. Other than that, there was surprisingly little competition 
between the network and the stations that carry its programming at CBS' annual 
convention here this week. 
</P>
<P>
"People were screaming and yelling several years ago when CBS first dropped 
into third place in the ratings," said Lee Wagner, general manager of KMVT-TV 
in Twin Falls, Ida. "But this time everybody came here more upbeat." 
</P>
<P>
Station managers said that they liked the pilots for CBS' upcoming prime-time 
schedule and were encouraged about CBS' prospect for improvement in the ratings 
under Jeff Sagansky, the new entertainment chief at the network. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see anything that looks like a breakaway hit, but this schedule is 
definitely commercial this time," Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best group of pilots I've seen in several years," said Marshall 
Noeker, president of Lamco Communications, which owns several CBS stations 
around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason the affiliates were upbeat, Noeker suggested, was that the 
network's performance during the May sweeps, when it finished second ahead of 
ABC, had benefited the stations' local news. 
</P>
<P>
Several affiliates cited "Lenny," a sitcom with a blue-collar hero, and "WIOU," 
a drama about a down-and-out TV station, as shows with potential. (The gallows 
humor in the "WIOU" pilot -- showing the news of overnight Nielsens upstaging a 
funeral for an anchorman -- was well received when the pilot was screened for 
the TV managers.) 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, CBS trotted out the anchors of its news programs, from Dan Rather to 
the casts of "60 Minutes" and "CBS This Morning," which has been showing gains 
in the ratings against NBC's "Today." 
</P>
<P>
During a closed-door session between affiliates and network executives, a 
question was raised about whether CBS might consider a co-anchor such as Connie 
Chung for "CBS Evening News." But CBS News President David Burke noted that 
audience research did not favor co-anchors in general and that such a concept 
was not being considered.

VALUE OF SANCTUARY SOUGHT IN STUDY

<P>
It may be hard to estimate in dollars the value of a pristine natural area, but 
that is what Julie Reynolds will try to do over the next year with the Channel 
Islands National Marine Sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds received a $15,000 grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration and the California Sea Grant program. This fellowship program, 
headquartered at the University of California at San Diego's Scripps Institute 
of Oceanography, matches graduate students interested in marine resource policy 
with state government agencies for paid fellowships. 
</P>
<P>
"She's going to try to come up with a figure for the value of the sanctuary," 
said Lt. Cmdr. Stephen Jameson, the sanctuary manager. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds graduated from Pomona College in Claremont with a BA in government and 
public policy analysis, with an emphasis on environmental policy analysis. 
</P>
<P>
She intends to continue her studies in graduate school. 
</P>
<P>
The Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary has an area of 1,252 square miles 
and is the largest of eight national sanctuaries. 
</P>
<P>
It encompasses the waters surrounding Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, San 
Miguel and Santa Barbara islands, and includes more than 100 shipwrecks and 
Chumash Indian sites. 
</P>
<P>
Jameson said the undertaking, which is the first of its kind in the nation, 
will reveal how much revenue the sanctuary brings to the area through such 
activities as fishing and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
Jameson and Reynolds said that they hope the study will also generate ideas for 
more ways to use the sanctuary for recreational and educational purposes 
without damaging the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to exploit the area," Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds is compiling a list of groups who use the ocean area, such as 
fishermen, divers, cruise ship operators and kelp harvesters. 
</P>
<P>
She hopes to find out how much money these groups have made from their use of 
the sanctuary since it was established in 1980, and compare that to earnings in 
the area 10 years before. 
</P>
<P>
Activities prohibited in the area since the sanctuary was designated are 
drilling for gas and oil, operating large barges and tankers, and dumping, 
Reynolds said. KIM KASH

PLANT PROPOSAL WORRIES NEIGHBORS

<P>
A proposed water treatment and hydropower plant below Lake Casitas Dam is 
alarming some area residents who fear changes to their quiet, rural 
neighborhood. Others are concerned about the plant's cost. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 people expressed their concerns at a Casitas Municipal Water District 
meeting earlier this week on the proposed $25-million plant, which would cost 
about $600,000 annually to operate. The meeting was held in Oak View to gather 
input on what issues should be studied in the environmental impact report and 
economic analysis of the project. The $117,000 report is expected to be 
released in November. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Barnett, the district's chief engineer, said the CMWD has exhausted all 
other ways to treat the lake water and must build the plant as soon as 
possible. The state Department of Health Services ordered the CMWD three years 
ago to meet state and federal water quality standards by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Sediment in the lake water, which is used for drinking water, has topped 
allowable levels for three months a year since 1988, Barnett said. The dirt and 
clay particles pose a health hazard because they insulate bacteria from the 
current chlorine disinfection method, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The new plant would filter 32 million gallons of water a day. Pat Baggerly of 
the Environmental Coalition of Ventura County asked CMWD scientists to, among 
other things, keep ozone and other chemical discharges from the plant from 
polluting the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Casitas Springs resident Barbara Garcia Weed said her neighbors are forming a 
task force to monitor the project's studies. "The plant's going to be sitting 
there basically in our back yard," she said, voicing concerns about noise, 
heavy truck traffic, earthquake safety and wildlife disruption. 
</P>
<P>
The water district sells water to 14 other agencies to serve 55,000 residents 
throughout the Ojai Valley, western Ventura and the northwestern corner of 
Ventura County. THIA BELL

REDEVELOPMENT ZONE TO GET HEARING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Santa Paula City Council will hold a public hearing next week on a proposed 
1,100-acre redevelopment zone, which would encompass the southern third of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
If the council approves the district Monday, sidewalks, streets and traffic 
signals would be upgraded, archaic sewer systems would be replaced and 
handicapped facilities such as sidewalk ramps would be installed, City 
Councilman Carl Barringer said. 
</P>
<P>
The area includes the Santa Paula Airport and some older homes, and is largely 
industrial and commercial. 
</P>
<P>
The creation of a redevelopment agency causes property tax revenues in the zone 
to be frozen for such agencies as the county and school districts that share 
the funds. These agencies no longer automatically benefit from any increase in 
property values. Instead, that increment is given to the redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
The 2% yearly increase in property taxes guaranteed by Prop. 13 would account 
for much of the $250 million in improvements that the city would like to make. 
In addition, taxes generated when houses are built, sold or remodeled would go 
to the redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
Negotiators for the city and the agencies that receive the tax revenues have 
proposed an agreement that would give the agencies a larger percentage of the 
property tax revenue than they would otherwise receive. For instance, the 
county would get 30% of the 2% increase allowed annually under Prop. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula is one of the last cities in Ventura County to establish a 
redevelopment agency. Camarillo is the only city in the county without a 
redevelopment agency, said Santa Paula Councilman Les Maland. AMELIA CHAFFEE

A NEW/OLD MARQUEE IS JUST THE TICKET

<P>
Fillmore's Towne Theater has gone back to the past to secure its future. 
</P>
<P>
The theater, one of only two single-screen movie houses in Ventura County, 
sports a flashy neon marquee reminiscent of the 1950s, thanks to a $13,000 
grant from the city's Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
When current owner Dale Larson purchased the building on Central Avenue 20 
years ago, painted sheet metal had covered the marquee for 10 years because the 
original neon was considered too troublesome and expensive to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, City Council members envisioned the theater as the centerpiece of a 
dressed-up downtown and supplied the funds to renovate it. 
</P>
<P>
The theater was built in 1912 by Judge Merton Barnes, who had a background in 
vaudeville before serving as Fillmore's justice of the peace for 16 years. 
Weekly movie programming was often supplemented by live shows produced by the 
traveling companies that passed through by railroad. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the local historical society, Barnes' daughter, Barbara, said 
that the judge kept the Barnes Theater active, occasionally staging minstrel 
shows himself. The performance space was considered very modern for its time, 
with plenty of room for storing scenery, and a trap door in the stage for 
disappearing acts. An electric organ provided background music from the 
theater's tiny orchestra pit. 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Chaplin films were such favorites that Barnes sponsored a look-alike 
contest. A photograph taken circa 1919 shows the assembled impostors in front 
of a brick-faced building without a marquee. An arch in the brickwork is the 
only clue that the would-be Chaplins were standing where the Towne Theater now 
has its ticket booth. 
</P>
<P>
Local historians date the theater's first neon marquee from the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
The new version is a good replica of the old work, but more colorful than the 
original, said Hal Graves, who manages the theater. The new marquee has 
brightened Central Avenue for nearly a year, but Graves said, "I still get 
comments almost every night about how nice it looks." JANET BERGAMO

JUSTICE: AN ATTACKER WHO SPARKED REFORMS IN 1975 WITH A REPEAT OFFENSE JUST 
NINE DAYS AFTER HE LEFT PRISON WAS SENTENCED FOR KILLING AND RAPING A GIRL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
A Glendale man who provoked a major public outcry against California's parole 
policies by assaulting a Burbank woman just nine days after his release from 
prison in 1975 was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole 
for the 1988 rape and murder of a Pacoima teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Kenneth Anderson, 46, who has a 23-year history of attacking women in 
the San Fernando Valley, was convicted in March by a Los Angeles Superior Court 
jury of raping and killing Suzanne Thomas, 16, and sentenced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Because Anderson was convicted of a murder committed in the course of another 
felony -- in this case, sexual assault -- he will not be eligible for parole, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ralph W. Plummer. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence is ironic, Plummer said, because in the mid-1970s Anderson's case 
added fuel to the controversy over California sentencing rules and parole 
policies then in effect, which were later altered to give judges more power in 
sentencing criminals. 
</P>
<P>
Just nine days after his 1975 release from eight years in prison for a string 
of sexual assaults on Valley women, Anderson attacked and permanently 
disfigured a young woman shortly after she arrived for work at a Burbank real 
estate office. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, the wife of a Los Angeles police officer, was beaten, stabbed and 
choked, until she was rescued by a passing officer who heard her screams, 
Plummer said. 
</P>
<P>
The case became a cause celebre for law enforcement officials who wanted to 
reform California's sentencing system, Plummer said. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1977, the California Penal Code established minimum and maximum 
sentences for specific crimes, but gave the state Parole Board almost total 
control of the length of a convict's incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of so-called "indeterminate sentences" said they allowed the state 
to hold criminals for long periods if they were identified as particularly 
dangerous. But some law enforcement officials complained that the policy 
enabled the state to release prisoners after very short periods in custody. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson first went to prison in 1967 for sexual assaults on women whom he 
kidnaped from five Valley bars. "He would go in and rob these beer bars, kidnap 
the barmaids, and force them to orally copulate him," Plummer said. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson's subsequent attack while out on parole incensed law enforcement 
officials, who argued that he should not have been released. 
</P>
<P>
"People said 'Why in the world did you let this guy out?' and it sparked a real 
lot of controversy, an attack on the parole system," Plummer said. "People said 
it was a travesty of justice." 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, the California Legislature adopted a policy that requires judges to 
determine fixed sentences from a narrow range of alternatives given for each 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy was founded on the assumption that rehabilitation of criminals 
was not effective and prison time should be viewed primarily as punishment, 
which should be uniform throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
Plummer said that in the aftermath of the Anderson case and several similar 
cases, citizens supported more power for judges because the judges are 
accountable to the voters and would therefore impose stricter sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson pleaded guilty to mayhem with intent to commit great harm, and 
returned to state prison. He served six years, until his parole in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost track of him until 1988," Plummer said.

Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) received $45,950 in campaign 
contributions from the scandal-plagued savings and loan industry in the 1980s, 
the 10th-highest amount among present House members, according to a Common 
Cause study. 
</P>
<P>
Among other San Fernando Valley-area representatives, Elton Gallegly (R-Simi 
Valley), who was first elected in 1986, received $20,050, and Carlos J. 
Moorhead (R-Glendale) received $14,635, the citizens lobby reported Thursday. 
Rep. William M. Thomas (R-Bakersfield), whose district reaches into the 
Antelope Valley, has received $11,800 since 1980, Common Cause said. 
</P>
<P>
Common Cause said the funds helped influence legislation that eased regulation 
of savings and loans. The industry cleanup approved by Congress will cost more 
than $300 billion; the FBI is investigating 530 failed institutions for 
possible criminal violations. 
</P>
<P>
"S &amp; L interests provided millions of dollars in campaign contributions to 
members of Congress throughout the 1980s," Common Cause President Fred 
Wertheimer said. "This contributed to the worst financial scandal in American 
history." 
</P>
<P>
No Valley-area representative has been directly associated with the scandal. 
None sit on the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee. And Berman 
and Gallegly arrived in Congress after it passed the most important legislation 
deregulating the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the largest and most politically active S &amp; Ls, including the 
failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn., were based in California. Lincoln gave 
$461,800 in contributions, Common Cause said. Six of the 10 biggest givers were 
California institutions; the top six House recipients were Californians. 
</P>
<P>
The area lawmakers' totals were relatively modest compared to the sums given to 
former Democratic leaders tarnished by the scandal. Former Speaker Jim Wright 
of Texas received $131,430; former House Banking chairman Fernand St. Germain 
of Rhode Island received $144,400 from 1981 to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known some of these people for a very long time and some of them 
generally support things I'm doing here that had nothing to do with the S &amp; 
L industry," Berman said of his contributors. "I certainly solicited 
contributions, and they must have responded." 
</P>
<P>
Berman said he opposed the industry by supporting the 1987 bailout proposal. 
The Reagan Administration called for $15 billion in new borrowing authority for 
the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. to bail out failing S &amp; Ls. 
</P>
<P>
The industry, which would have been required to pay interest on the borrowed 
funds, succeeded in lowering the bailout amount to $5 billion on the House 
floor. The final figure was $10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and four other senators are under investigation 
by the Senate Ethics Committee for intervening with federal regulators on 
behalf of Lincoln. Berman said he has never been asked to go to bat for any S 
&amp; L.

BUDGET FOR SCHOOLS WOULD TRIGGER 269 LAYOFFS; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: MOST OF THE JOBS THAT WOULD BE LOST INVOLVE LOWER-PAYING POSTS, 
INCLUDING CLERICAL, CUSTODIAL, MAINTENANCE AND CAFETERIA STAFF. 
</P>

<P>
A feuding, frustrated Los Angeles Board of Education has ground out a 
precariously balanced, tentative budget that triggers 269 layoffs and hinges in 
part on improving student attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the layoffs, part of an overall work force reduction that took about 
1,000 jobs, are among the lower-paying, so-called "classified" jobs -- 
including clerical and other office workers, custodians, maintenance workers 
and cafeteria staff. Many of those jobs are held by blacks, Latinos and other 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been the hardest thing I've ever done since I've been in public 
office," Board President Jackie Goldberg said as the board approved its 
preliminary 1990-91 spending package Thursday on a 6-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Golberg noted that up to $120 million more will have to be made by the time a 
final budget is adopted in late August if the governor's proposals to ease the 
state's own financial problems are approved. 
</P>
<P>
In finishing their chore of slicing $220 million -- more than 5% -- from a 
tentative budget of just under $4 billion, the board chopped another $8 million 
from individual school budgets. The amount each school will lose, along with 
whether school community councils can help decide how to spend what is left, 
will be decided later. 
</P>
<P>
The board saved $6.8 million by requiring all non-teaching employees who work 
11 or 12 months of the year to work five days less next year, resulting in pay 
cuts of about 2%. The total pay loss will be as high as 15% for some of those 
employees who were also affected in earlier rounds of budget-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
The board took another $9.8 million from the already hard-hit district 
administrative offices. Robert Booker, the district's chief business and 
financial officer, said he believes that amount can be raised by having the 
schools do a more aggressive job of improving student attendance. The state 
pays districts based on how many students show up for class, so those with low 
attendance rates lose money. 
</P>
<P>
There will be an incentive plan to encourage schools to redouble attendance 
efforts despite shrinking staff and other resources. If attendance can be 
boosted, Booker told dubious board members, it is unlikely that more jobs will 
be lost. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Rita Walters was infuriated by a vote of a majority of board 
members to set aside $500,000 to keep six principals from being replaced by 
administrators with more seniority who will be demoted to save money. Of those 
principals scheduled to be bumped, only those who will head up campuses that 
are moving to school-based management will be spared. Under school-based 
management, most decisions are made by groups at the school instead of district 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no fairness here!" burst out Walters, who felt the funds should have 
gone toward saving the jobs of those workers "who, come Sunday (the start of 
the fiscal year), are out on the street." Walters, who cast the only vote 
against the budget, accused her colleagues of making policies that are 
anti-black. Walters is the only black member of the board. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a vote to add 21 more schools to the list of those getting 
increasingly scarce integration funds that sparked the sharpest clash of the 
long, tense day. 
</P>
<P>
The schools are the latest in the increasingly minority district to reach a 
point at which 70% of their students are Latino, black, Asian or other 
non-Anglos, making them available for special funds to ease the harms of 
segregation. 
</P>
<P>
Walters objected that these schools, many of them in more affluent, suburban 
neighborhoods, would take money away from inner-city "children who need it 
most." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm frankly sick of your making a racial issue out of everything," exclaimed 
San Fernando Valley board member Julie Korenstein, who said many of the 21 
schools have large numbers of inner-city children bused in from crowded schools 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"People who don't know anything should keep their mouths shut," Walters shot 
back. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier rounds of budget cutting, the board saved nearly $1 million by 
freezing the pay of its top 111 administrators, took $8 million in lottery 
funds away from schools and increased some class sizes. It also eliminated the 
district's staff of school physicians and sliced deeply into custodial, 
maintenance and other services, including teacher training. 
</P>
<P>
And in chopping $43 million and 634 jobs from district administration, the 
board set in motion the bumping actions in which those in offices whose jobs 
are cut are sent back to the schools, displacing principals and others with 
less seniority. 
</P>
<P>
The board allowed the layoffs to proceed after a last-ditch attempt to save 
them met with a lukewarm reception. A coalition of black leaders and educators 
on Monday called on all employees to donate 4% of their paychecks next year to 
the district. But on Thursday just three employee groups stepped forward. 
</P>
<P>
Two groups of administrators offered to make the donation if everyone else did, 
and the union that represents about 5,000 office and technical workers said it 
would consider doing so to save the 100 jobs lost in its own group.

SKATERS, COACHES PROTEST PLAN TO CLOSE ICE ARENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
About 150 figure skaters, hockey players and coaches picketed Burbank's 
Pickwick Ice Arena to protest the planned closure of the landmark facility that 
has served as the training center for a handful of Olympic athletes. 
</P>
<P>
The protesters, many of them children, chanted "Save our rink" Thursday and 
carried homemade signs tacked to the ends of hockey sticks as they marched 
outside the rink near the Los Angeles Equestrian Center. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to fight," said 9-year-old Brad Haber of Chatsworth, goalie for a 
youth hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old rink, home of one of the most prestigious figure-skating clubs 
in the country and a popular practice arena for many local hockey clubs, will 
close Sept. 30, Manager Cary Adams announced at a noisy meeting of skating 
enthusiasts Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors that the arena would close had been circulating since April, but the 
news came as a shock to its users, especially because it is one of the few 
Olympic-sized rinks in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want a battle," said Nancy Forbes, whose son Kirk practices figure 
skating at the arena. "We just want a place for our kids to skate." 
</P>
<P>
Pickwick owner Walter Stavert said the protest would not change the decision to 
close the arena. "We've pretty well made up our minds," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But protest organizer and skating instructor Russell Sessions said many skaters 
understand the decision to close the arena and will settle for more time to 
find an alternate facility. 
</P>
<P>
Stavert did not rule out a postponement of the closing date. "We'll have to 
work with that when it comes to us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said the owners, Stavert and his brother Edward, decided in January to 
close the aging rink because it needs about $500,000 in repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"The revenue on it just doesn't warrant that kind of work," Walter Stavert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Pickwick is home base for the highly competitive Los Angeles Figure Skating 
Club, which has nurtured such Olympic skaters as Linda Fratianne of Northridge, 
Tiffany Chin of Toluca Lake and Christopher Bowman of Van Nuys. The rink is 
used by speed skating clubs, hockey teams, pleasure skaters and students.

DESBROW HOLDS ON TO WIN FIRECRACKER 50

<P>
Marty Desbrow of Ventura powered past Jim Jewett of Oxnard on the front 
straightaway of Lap 14 and held on to win the yellow flag-plagued Firecracker 
50 Mini Stock main event at Ventura Raceway on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Moore of Oxnard finished second in the track's longest race of the season 
and Rock Ake Jr. of Moorpark was third. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's Firecracker 50 champion, Bill Floyd of Ventura, failed to complete 
one lap. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Firsich of Port Hueneme overtook Gary Garvin of Ventura on Lap 5 of the 
15-lap Street Stock main event and held off hard-charging Jim Powell Jr. of 
Cypress for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth main-event win of the season for Firsich. Powell fought his 
way from last place to finish second. Bill Pate of Oxnard was third. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Olsen of Ventura bumped Firsich hard from behind in Turn 1 of the last 
lap to force Firsich high and give Olsen the daylight he needed to win the 
Street Stock six-lap figure-eight main event. Firsich, the Street Stock season 
points leader, held on for second with Ventura's Tom Stephens was third. 
</P>
<P>
Mini Stock figure-eight season points leader Richard Webster of Camarillo led 
wire-to-wire and edged Russ Warren of Van Nuys by one-half car length to win 
the six-lap figure-eight main event. Terry Swauger of Ojai was third. 
</P>
<P>
Mini Stock 10-lap heat winners were Jewett and Kevin Parker of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Firsich came from sixth place to win an eight-lap Street Stock heat and Powell 
came from eighth place to win another heat. 
</P>
<P>
Jewett drove to an easy victory in the Mini Stock eight-lap semi-main event. 
Webster was second and Gary Swenson of Ventura third. 
</P>
<P>
Desbrow won the six-lap Mini Stock Trophy Dash and Bill Famularo of Simi Valley 
drove to victory in the four-lap Street Stock Trophy Dash. 
</P>
<P>
Powell set the one-lap fast qualifying time in the Street Stocks at 16.678 
seconds.

OPERATING EXPENSES FIGURE TO CLIMB FOR VAN BLARGAN FOLLOWING CRASH

Talk about psych jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Tracy Van Blargan, a Camarillo dentist who doubles as a driver in three-quarter 
Midget race cars in his spare time, offered a rather interesting proposition to 
his fellow drivers before racing got under way last Saturday at Ventura 
Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
Van Blargan, 32, known for his sense of humor, sent a pre-race message to 
promoter Jim Naylor to read over the public-address system to a near-capacity 
crowd of 2,300. 
</P>
<P>
To the winner of the three-quarter Midget main event, said Van Blargan's 
message, goes a free root-canal job. 
</P>
<P>
A free root-canal job? Gee, thanks, Tracy, his fellow drivers must have 
thought. We'd rather have our bodies tied to the back bumper of a 
demolition-derby Chevy. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Blargan smiled in the pits. 
</P>
<P>
"With my luck," he told his crew, "I'll probably win." 
</P>
<P>
Wishful thinking. 
</P>
<P>
In attempting to qualify for the main event, Van Blargan suffered a 
tooth-rattling spill as his car flipped several times during a crash in a 
semi-main event race. An ambulance took Van Blargan away, but he insisted that 
he was OK. Dentists, after all, know all about pain. 
</P>
<P>
"It knocked the wind out of me," Van Blargan said. "I was dazed but conscious. 
They kept asking me who the heck I was." 
</P>
<P>
After a fall like that, could Van Blargan answer? 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, yeah," he said. "I was passing out my business card." 
</P>
<P>
Add root canal: As for the root canal, Van Blargan's offer still stands. 
</P>
<P>
Catch was, the winner of the main event was 19-year-old Cory Kruseman of 
Ventura, the points standings leader. 
</P>
<P>
Take one guess who Kruseman's regular dentist is. 
</P>
<P>
Water hazard: Will Harper of Tarzana has been driving so consistently in Saugus 
Speedway's Sportsman division this year that it was strange to see him receive 
a black flag -- an order to pull into the pit -- in last Saturday's 40-lap main 
event. 
</P>
<P>
But it was one of those nights for the defending Sportsman champion and current 
points leader. With Harper firmly in control of fifth place, a "racing 
incident" -- as Harper diplomatically termed it -- led to a strange turn of 
events. 
</P>
<P>
On Turn 3 of Lap 29, Harper put his foot to the brake and found, much to his 
consternation, that there were no brakes. His foot went straight to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
His car tangled with one driven by Dave Phipps of Simi Valley and the bang-up 
eventually involved Keith Spangler of Northridge and Larry Woodside of Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
After the tie-up, Harper radioed his crew that he had a broken brake line. So 
when Harper reached his pit, the crew was ready. Basically, says Harper, they 
eliminated one of the rear brakes to get him back on the track. 
</P>
<P>
However, his troubles weren't finished. It turns out that a fan belt had broken 
on Lap 29, but neither Harper nor his crew was aware of it. 
</P>
<P>
The engine overheated, blowing water all over the track when Harper resumed 
racing. As a result, Harper was black-flagged by the officials since his car 
was now a hazard. 
</P>
<P>
Tough night. 
</P>
<P>
Add Harper: Although Harper finished 14th to pick up two points, his points 
lead was shaved to 41 when John Cran of Reseda won the main event to move into 
second place. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always said that the only comfortable lead is a 52-point lead," Harper 
said. "Because then you could have two no-shows, and somebody would have to win 
two main events just to tie you. And that's unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
"Definitely, a lead is better than no lead. I didn't have the lead last year 
until the final night." 
</P>
<P>
As for his car, which had a rough induction into summer, Harper remains 
confident. 
</P>
<P>
"We did a few things to get back the edge," Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
Motocross wrap: Mike Kiedrowski of Canyon Country finished the 1990 American 
Motorcyclist Assn. Supercross Series in fourth place in the standings with 285 
points. Kiedrowski's homecoming last Saturday at the Los Angeles Coliseum in 
the 250cc super challenge was a successful one as he placed third, ahead of 
another local favorite, Johnny O'Mara of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
O'Mara finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
For his efforts, Kiedrowski, the 1989 125cc champion, earned a $10,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
The race at the Coliseum was the finale in the 18-race circuit. The final 
points standings saw O'Mara finish 11th (195 points) and Erik Kahoe of finish 
Saugus 18th (57 points).

L.A. GAMES PREVIEW;

<P>
HART AND CANYON TO RENEW RIVALRY 
</P>

<P>
Hart and Canyon highs, which have formed one of the area's most prestigious 
football rivalries through the past seven falls, reluctantly will meet in the 
semifinals of the L.A. Games' passing tournament Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the offense is limited to a passing attack under the L.A. Games' 
format, the contest likely won't pass without its share of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
The schools meet in a traditional nonleague game that attracts 8,000 to 10,000 
spectators, and one meeting a year is enough as far as Hart Coach Mike 
Herrington is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"We really don't like to play (Canyon) during the summer," Herrington said. 
"It's a pretty emotional game. We're big rivals and people make a pretty big 
deal over it." 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the 8:30 a.m. game at El Camino College will meet the winner of 
the Morningside-Westchester game in the final at noon. 
</P>
<P>
Hart, which must replace all of its starting skill-position players from last 
year's 9-1 team, has not reached the L.A. Games semifinals since 1986. This 
year Hart has beaten Fremont, 13-0; San Marino, 7-6; and Granada Hills, 14-13. 
</P>
<P>
Junior quarterback Ryan Connors has played well in place of Rob Westervelt, who 
will play at Weber State in the fall. Connors, 5-foot-10 and 170 pounds, led 
the sophomore team to the Foothill League championship last season. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon Coach Harry Welch has been impressed with the Cowboys' stingy defense 
and explosive offense. Canyon outscored Notre Dame, North Torrance and Kennedy, 
88-26, in reaching the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"Our defense has been aggressive and we've had good intensity," Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous area schools will compete in other sports today. 
</P>
<P>
In baseball, City Section 4-A Division champion Chatsworth will play Tustin in 
a noon quarterfinal at Redondo High. The winner will play in the semifinals at 
3 p.m at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
Royal will play North Torrance in a quarterfinal boys' soccer match at 9:30 
a.m. at El Camino. In girls' soccer, Chaminade faces Torrance for the 
championship at 10 a.m., also at El Camino. 
</P>
<P>
In the fourth round of the boys' basketball tournament, Cleveland will play 
Locke at 10 a.m. and Crescenta Valley will meet Manual Arts at noon in El 
Camino's south gymnasium. In the north gym, Pasadena will play Carson at 11 
a.m. and La Canada will meet Morningside at noon. 
</P>
<P>
Three area schools are among the final eight competing in the girls' basketball 
championships at Locke High. Channel Islands will play Cerritos at 10 a.m. and 
Buena will meet Simi Valley at 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
In water polo, Harvard and Pasadena are among the final eight teams that will 
play at Harvard High today. The host school will meet Muir at 8 a.m. and 
Pasadena faces San Gorgonio at 11:30 a.m.

A BUSY NIGHT SHAPING UP FOR GRANT ALL-STAR LEWIS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Marlowe Lewis will start at wide receiver for the first time in his high school 
career in the Glendale-Burbank All-Star Football Game at La Canada High tonight 
at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
But don't expect the Grant High standout to stay there too long. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who will attend the University of Hawaii in the fall, also is expected 
to see action at quarterback, tailback and possibly defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll play him wherever he can get involved," said Grant Coach Bill Foster, 
who will guide the Burbank team. "That's what you do with a kid that can do it 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis will be among 72 graduating seniors from 26 area high schools. Nic Larez 
of La Canada High will coach the Glendale squad. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, playing quarterback and defensive back, helped lead the Lancers (9-2) to 
the East Valley League title last fall. The 5-foot-10, 165-pound Lewis, a Times 
All-Valley first-team choice, completed 48 of 112 passes for 805 yards and 
rushed for 759 more. He was selected to the All-City Section 3-A Division first 
team at defensive back.

Lewis will be joined by four of his Grant teammates, including tailback Shawn 
Booker, who rushed for 815 yards.

"I thought it would be fun to play in one more game with Coach (Foster) and my

Bolstered by the throwing of Santiago Alvarez of Franklin and Chris Bisgaard of 
Flintridge Prep, Glendale likely will go to the air.

Alvarez, the City Section 3-A Division Player of the Year, set state passing 
marks for yardage (4,019) and touchdowns (52) last season. Bisgaard will be 
throwing to Flintridge Prep teammate David Swayne.

'UNCOMPROMISING' REVIEW OF CONCERT BY VERLAINE, SHAWN HITS THE RIGHT NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I commend you for your insightful review of the Tom Verlaine and Shawn Colvin 
concert ("Verlaine's Acoustic Set Lacks Electricity" by Mike Boehm, June 14). I 
agree with much of what you said in that piece, and in fact I had discussed 
many of the same points with my wife after departing that night. 
</P>
<P>
(We were among the select few who stuck around after the eccentricity became 
too overwhelming for most of the crowd.) 
</P>
<P>
It was a fascinating concert, pairing as it did two quite dissimilar performers 
who nevertheless helped in their respective performances to demonstrate how 
powerful a solo concert can be and how much it partakes of theater as well as 
musical presentation. I do think Colvin deserved a bit more coverage in the 
review, although I couldn't agree more with your comments about how much richer 
and more compelling she sounded live than on record. Hers was a very satisfying 
performance, and it was complemented nicely by the more ragged and unnerving 
performance Verlaine gave. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, I'm glad to see such a thoughtful and uncompromising review of such a 
rewarding concert. As a semi-retired reviewer myself, I can appreciate the 
insights and the good writing even more. I wish there were more of us around 
who like such music and enjoy articulating our responses in some way. I don't 
get out to live concerts much anymore, but I definitely treasure an evening 
like the one Verlaine and Colvin supplied. Keep up the good work.

TURNING A DEAF EAR TO CONFESSION; 
</P>
<P>
A MAN KEEPS ADMITTING TO A SLAYING FOR WHICH HIS BROTHER IS IMPRISONED. THE 
CASE ILLUSTRATES HOW LOATH APPEALS COURTS ARE TO OVERTURN CONVICTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Xavier Sanders has confessed repeatedly to a 1985 fatal shooting in Compton. He 
has confessed to lawyers, to his family, to a court in a sworn statement, and 
most recently, to a newspaper reporter. But the authorities won't do anything 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
It's not that what Sanders says is beyond belief. Some of the eyewitnesses 
initially identified him as the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that Xavier's brother Sheldon has already been convicted of the 
crime, and authorities have closed the books on the case. 
</P>
<P>
The situation seems absurd: Sheldon Sanders, who says he is innocent, is in 
prison -- possibly for life -- while Xavier, who repeatedly confesses, is free. 
Or, as Xavier told The Times, "He's doing the time for something he didn't do. 
And I did it." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, not only prosecutors, but the appellate courts as well, have been 
unwilling to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
Appeals courts are sometimes criticized by law-and-order advocates for being 
too willing to free guilty criminals on technicalities. Yet experts say appeals 
courts rarely reverse convictions and, if anything, fail to hold police, 
prosecutors and judges accountable to fair trial standards because of their 
desire to affirm convictions whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
Intent on overturning convictions only if flagrant violations of due process 
are found, they are not particularly good at detecting innocence, research 
shows. As former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart once explained, it 
is not their job. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not the function of this court to determine innocence or guilt," he 
wrote. "Our duty is to uphold the Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Uelmen, dean of the Santa Clara University Law School and president of 
the California Academy of Appellate Lawyers, said the Sanders' case is "a 
textbook example" of appeals courts' reluctance to second-guess trial judges 
and juries -- even if it means they have to "almost put blinders on." 
</P>
<P>
Why the reluctance? 
</P>
<P>
Some critics charge that the answer is simple: the legal system does not want 
to admit its mistakes. "Everybody likes to bury their mistakes in this system," 
said Leslie Abramson, a defense lawyer who tried unsuccessfully to reopen 
Sheldon Sanders' case. 
</P>
<P>
But prosecutors insist that is not so. "I'm not saying mistakes aren't made," 
said Steven Sowders, head of the district attorney's Compton office, where the 
prosecution took place. "I think I'm fairly open-minded about those things." 
</P>
<P>
But Sowders said he thinks no mistake was made in this case. He said he thinks 
Xavier Sanders' confessions are merely an attempt to trick authorities into 
freeing his brother, at little risk to Xavier himself. 
</P>
<P>
If Xavier Sanders is charged with the shooting and tried, he might well be 
acquitted, the prosecutor said. He could tell a jury that his confessions were 
a ruse to free his brother. He could also note that all five eyewitnesses who 
testified at Sheldon Sanders' trial said that Sheldon -- not Xavier -- was the 
gunman. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to get caught in that," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Xavier Sanders said he knows authorities do not believe him. But 
the unemployed 27-year-old man, who has a criminal record of robbery, cocaine 
and weapons convictions, declared: "I wouldn't lie about something like this 
here. I done come forward so many times, they should get the hint." 
</P>
<P>
The state Court of Appeal, meanwhile, recently adopted prosecutors' reasoning 
in refusing to grant a new trial to Sheldon Sanders, who is 24 and serving a 
17-year-to-life sentence for murder -- his first offense. 
</P>
<P>
But in doing so, the court raised the ire of one judge, Earl Johnson, who wrote 
a scathing dissent, arguing that the court was relying on speculation to "save 
the present conviction" and, in the process, giving justice a back seat to 
expediency. 
</P>
<P>
That was just part of one of the sharpest and most bitter exchanges between 
state Court of Appeal justices in memory -- with each side accusing the other 
of intellectual dishonesty and the majority going so far as to liken Johnson's 
analysis to that of "a first-year law school student." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who is known for his liberal stances on social issues, is also known 
as among the brightest justices on the court. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not one of the typical cases where the issue on appeal is whether a 
guilty man should be let free because he was convicted through illegally 
obtained evidence," he wrote. "Nor is it a case where the error asserted on 
appeal would reduce the prosecution's evidence of appellant's guilt to 
something less than guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. No, this is one of those 
rare cases where . . . the . . . error . . . goes to the core issue of the 
defendant's innocence." 
</P>
<P>
And that may be another part of the problem. Claims of innocence sometimes 
throw appeals courts for a loop. "They don't know how to deal with innocence," 
said Abramson. In fact, state law does not allow a convict to appeal simply on 
the grounds that he is innocent. Guilt or innocence is the domain of the trial 
judge and jury. 
</P>
<P>
Appeals courts are set up to decide broad policy questions and to regulate the 
conduct of the lower trial courts and of police and prosecutors by insisting 
that convictions be arrived at fairly. 
</P>
<P>
They reverse convictions only on questions of law, as opposed to fact, and only 
when they have to -- which usually means that the convict's rights were 
violated in a particularly flagrant way. 
</P>
<P>
"They really are not sitting as the 13th juror," said Patricia Nelson of the 
California Appellate Project, which advises appeals lawyers representing 
indigent criminal defendants. "In cases of factual innocence, the only strong 
case you can come in with is where the prosecutor has hidden evidence. But 
where the defense has ineptly or maliciously failed to put on the very same 
evidence, then you're in deep trouble." 
</P>
<P>
This reflects the reluctance of the Court of Appeal to reverse convictions 
because defense lawyers were incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard to convince a reviewing court that . . . counsel dropped the 
ball," said Uelmen, the Santa Clara Law School dean, "and the reality . . . is 
that there's a hell of a lot of incompetence out there, and the court should 
look at those claims seriously." 
</P>
<P>
In the Sanders case, for instance, the jury that convicted Sheldon never 
learned that Xavier had confessed. 
</P>
<P>
That was because Sheldon Sanders' lawyer literally told Xavier to get lost. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Johnson in his dissent said this was a crucial omission -- and 
indicative of incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
"Can anyone seriously question," he wrote, "the devastating impact of a witness 
testifying, 'The defendant didn't do it. I did it?' " 
</P>
<P>
However, the two-justice majority guessed that Sheldon Sanders' attorney had a 
good reason for not introducing testimony about Xavier's confessions -- making 
the question of the confessions' potential impact on jurors legally moot. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney, Philip Jefferson, was not available for questioning because he 
had left the state after being disbarred for a 10-year-pattern of misconduct in 
the handling of clients' cases. 
</P>
<P>
But the majority surmised, in a decision written by Justice Fred Woods, that 
Jefferson might have known that Xavier Sanders' confessions were false and 
decided not to present them because it would have been unethical for a lawyer 
to knowingly present lies in court. 
</P>
<P>
Justice Woods, in an opinion in which Justice Mildred Lillie concurred, accused 
Johnson of making an argument characterized by "transparent triviality . . . 
more befitting a first-year law school student aflush with issue-spotting 
passion" than a justice of the Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Woods said it was evident that members of Sheldon Sanders' family were willing 
to perjure themselves. He noted that some family members had testified that 
Sheldon was home at the time of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to Xavier Sanders' confessions, Sheldon had accompanied him to a 
spot near the scene of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, someone in the Sanders family had lied, and Woods wrote that he 
thought it was Xavier. He said Xavier's confessions had the "damning odor of 
recently manufactured evidence." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson termed this pure speculation. "Unless a higher court intervenes," he 
wrote, "this (decision) will be enough to condemn the brother who proclaims his 
innocence -- and could well be innocent -- to spend his best years in prison 
while the brother who admits the crime remains free." 
</P>
<P>
Experts say it is unlikely that the state Supreme Court will get involved. That 
court, the state's highest, must hear death penalty appeals and lawyer 
disciplinary cases. Other than that, it chooses the cases it wants to hear with 
an eye toward making broad public policy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is a chance you can get a case like this heard by the 
Supreme Court anymore," Uelmen said. "The Court of Appeal (the state's 
intermediate appellate court, which must hear all appeals from convicted 
felons) is the end of the line when you're talking about whether justice was 
done in a particular case. The California Supreme Court . . . is interested in 
cases that will have a major impact on the law. And cases like this don't fall 
into that category. There's no room on the docket for a case like this." 
</P>
<P>
In a landmark 1982 study of how a California Court of Appeal works, Thomas 
Davies, of the American Bar Foundation, remarked on the essentially 
conservative nature of the appellate process. 
</P>
<P>
"The data . . . tend to refute any notion that the Court of Appeal is eager or 
even willing to reverse serious convictions on the basis of procedural 
technicalities," Davies wrote. "The more appropriate question is whether the 
very restrained review of criminal proceedings . . . is adequate for the 
enforcement of due process standards in the trial courts." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the justices' concern, researchers say, is not to make unnecessary and 
demoralizing work for trial judges by sending back too many cases for them to 
try again. And part of the concern is not to let guilty people go free. 
</P>
<P>
Most criminal cases on appeal involve serious, even horrendous crimes where 
there is little doubt about a convict's guilt. In California, 17 of every 18 
appealed convictions are affirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Justices have told academic researchers that they find procedural errors in 
virtually all trials, but tend to call them harmless. 
</P>
<P>
Justices also avoid second-guessing trial courts as long as they can find any 
substantial evidence -- contradicted or not -- to support a trial court's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Some justices have spoken frankly and harshly in off-the-record talks with 
researchers by comparing their processing of these cases to "getting rid of the 
garbage" or dealing with "these rotten little cases." 
</P>
<P>
But a problem can arise when an innocent man appeals. 
</P>
<P>
While no one knows how many people are wrongly convicted each year, C. Ronald 
Huff, director of the Criminal Justice Research Center at Ohio State 
University, has collected estimates from law enforcement professionals, most of 
whom believe that wrongful convictions occur less than 1% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
If the true error rate was only one-half of 1% in serious felony cases, that 
would still mean 6,000 wrongful convictions nationwide every year, Huff said. 
</P>
<P>
Huff also collected accounts of 500 cases in which the government ultimately 
admitted it convicted the wrong man. Appeals courts had affirmed convictions in 
most of them. 
</P>
<P>
To account for this, Huff coined "the ratification of error principle," which 
holds that the more people in authority who look at a case, the greater the 
chances are that they will not look at it carefully, because they are inclined 
to trust the judgments of those who have looked at it before. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Sanders case is tangled, what is known is that 18-year-old Norman 
Gregory became a victim of senseless violence. He was shot to death at the 
Gregory family's Compton home. 
</P>
<P>
What is also known is that Sheldon Sanders had reason to be angry with the 
Gregorys. One of Sheldon's older brothers was married to Norman Gregory's 
sister, and she had reportedly accused Sheldon of hitting her. 
</P>
<P>
When Sheldon showed up at the Gregory household, Norman and another of the 
Gregory brothers punched him and threw a rock at his car windshield, cracking 
it. Sheldon Sanders sped away, reportedly saying he would be back to get 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, a car containing three men pulled up at the Gregory house. 
Only one of them got out. 
</P>
<P>
He had a rifle and fired a shot at one of the Gregory family's cars, breaking 
its window. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as the Gregory brothers and some friends gathered at the front door, the 
gunman walked toward the house. 
</P>
<P>
Those at the door testified that the gunman taunted them before firing a shot 
that penetrated the door. It struck and killed Norman Gregory. 
</P>
<P>
Then the gunman got back in his car and fled. 
</P>
<P>
In his confessions, Xavier Sanders claimed that he was the gunman but that he 
taunted no one. 
</P>
<P>
In a distinction that could mean the difference between murder and the lesser 
crime of manslaughter, Xavier Sanders claimed he didn't know the Gregory 
brothers were standing at the door and didn't realize his shot had hit anyone 
until later. 
</P>
<P>
He said Sheldon Sanders and another of his brothers were with him, but stayed 
in the car and had no idea he was going to shoot. 
</P>
<P>
Once he learned that Norman Gregory had been shot, he said he confessed to his 
mother. She confirms this. He said he then retained a lawyer and confessed to 
him too. The lawyer also confirms this. 
</P>
<P>
But when he was arrested as a suspect in the shooting, he refused to talk to 
police, and the police let him go. Only Sheldon Sanders was charged. 
</P>
<P>
Eyewitness accounts were conflicting. Some initially identified Xavier Sanders 
as the gunman, according to police reports, but all later agreed the gunman was 
the slighter-built Sheldon Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
At Sheldon's first trial, which resulted in a hung jury, Xavier Sanders was 
summoned as a witness by the defense, but invoked his Fifth Amendment right not 
to incriminate himself on the advice of a court-appointed lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
When the district attorney's office sought to try Sheldon Sanders a second 
time, the family switched lawyers, hiring Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
"We told Mr. Jefferson that Xavier was the one who fired the rifle," said the 
brothers' mother, Regina Sanders. "We just wanted justice to be served right 
because Sheldon did not shoot that boy." 
</P>
<P>
But Jefferson did not want to talk with Xavier, Mrs. Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, she said, she brought Xavier to the courtroom during the second 
trial and told Jefferson, "Xavier is here to testify." 
</P>
<P>
But she said Jefferson told Xavier to go away. 
</P>
<P>
"I left," Xavier recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding was that . . . I guess he had a better chance of doing 
whatever he was going to do without exposing me. He could have been under the 
impression that I was lying, I don't know, because I never talked to him. He 
could have been doing it for my own good." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Jefferson was doing, it didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
After Sheldon Sanders was convicted, his family hired another attorney, 
Abramson, who obtained a sworn written confession from Xavier, which was filed 
in court. She also interested attorney Rowan Klein in the case. 
</P>
<P>
Klein and Sheldon Sanders' appellate attorney, R. Charles Johnson, then 
persuaded the Court of Appeal to ask the judge who had presided at the second 
trial to hold a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Although Xavier Sanders confessed to Klein on tape and agreed to testify, he 
got cold feet on the witness stand. While he made a series of admissions, 
saying that he was the only one who had gotten out of the car and was the only 
one with a gun, he stopped short of saying he fired it. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he followed the advice of another court-appointed lawyer and invoked 
the Fifth Amendment on that question. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why I didn't say it," he told The Times. "I was ready to say it. 
But the whole thing changed. The judge got an attorney for me. They got that 
attorney to speak for me."

BUSH WOULD CAMPAIGN FOR A TAX INCREASE 
</P>

<P>
President Bush, turning aside criticism from his own party, declared Friday 
that if he and Congress can agree on a deficit reduction package, then he will 
campaign actively for it -- even if that means pushing for higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that he had abandoned his "read my lips" pledge not to raise taxes 
because an "enormous" budget deficit now threatens the nation's economic health 
and that his shift has put budget negotiations with Congress "back on track." 
And he expressed hope that agreement can be reached within a month -- a 
timetable many in Congress consider highly optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
"If and when we come up with a program that raises revenue," Bush said, ". . . 
why then I will go out there and advocate strong bipartisan support for this." 
</P>
<P>
He called the budget summit talks "a make-or-break effort at responsible 
government" and pointed out that, unless agreement is reached before October, 
the sequestration provisions of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law will 
result in automatic cuts of nearly $100 billion in government services. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential results are Draconian cuts in defense, student grants and a wide 
array of other necessary domestic services. And, to avoid this, tough decisions 
must be made," he said. "And leadership is needed, and that is exactly what 
Administration officials are seeking to provide . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The President, whose reversal on taxes touched off a firestorm of criticism 
from Republican conservatives, looked relaxed and confident at a hurriedly 
called press conference. He portrayed his move as the kind of decision required 
of presidents. 
</P>
<P>
"Arrows have been flying, front, back, sideways, but that's what I get paid 
for," he said. "And, when you make a change that people see as a dramatic 
shift," he said, "you've got to batten down the hatches and take the heat." 
</P>
<P>
After what he called two days of "slings and arrows," Bush said he has a 
comfortable feeling that, "if I do my job right" and it helps facilitate budget 
negotiations and achieve an agreement, "then I can go to the American people 
and say: 'Look, we've all had to give or take a little on this. But this 
agreement is going to be good for future generations, it's going to be good for 
the economy, it's going to be good for jobs.' Then people will say: 'Look, we 
support the President.' " 
</P>
<P>
As President, he said, he must "look at the big picture and the welfare of this 
country, and put it ahead of my own strongly held preferences and everything 
else." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said that he had expected the "fairly intense" flak he has encountered 
from fellow Republicans but indicated that he thinks it will be short-lived. 
Research shows that "these firestorms come and go," he said, recalling a 
previous "furor something like we're hearing now" when taxes were raised in 
1982 during the Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Although pressed on the issue, Bush repeatedly refused to discuss which taxes 
might be raised. Budget negotiators, he said, have agreed not to disclose 
details of their discussions. 
</P>
<P>
As for how GOP congressional candidates should deal with the fallout from his 
shift in election campaigns this fall, Bush said that he would tell them: "Now 
look, you've got to look at the big picture here. Stay with your position. 
Advocate what you believe and what you -- tell your constituents what you'll 
try to do, and then just stay a little bit open-minded so when we get an 
agreement . . . that is good for the country, then you can say, 'Well, we can 
accept this . . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
However, conservative Republicans critical of Bush's decision contend that he 
is in danger of condoning higher taxes without getting substantial spending 
cuts or other concessions from Democrats in return. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard a coherent explanation from the White House of what they want 
to accomplish at the end of the road," Rep. Vin Weber (R-Minn.), a leader of 
House conservatives, said in an interview. "Our goal should be to get a capital 
gains tax cut. That's more important than any particular action on the 
deficit." 
</P>
<P>
But, while many Republicans were roasting Bush, Democrats -- who have faulted 
him as failing to show leadership on domestic issues -- hailed him as a 
statesman. 
</P>
<P>
"He's starting to act like a President," House Ways and Means Committee 
Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) said after Bush's news conference. 
</P>
<P>
For Bush, the impact of his switch on taxes may depend in large part not only 
on the long-term health of the economy but also on how the Democrats handle the 
tax issue. If they insist on the kind of progressive tax package they favor, 
according to conservative analyst Kevin Phillips, "Bush could really be in a 
box." 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats want to impose an income tax rate of 33% on those in the highest 
income brackets to eliminate the "bubble" in the current tax code, which allows 
taxpayers in the top brackets to pay a maximum rate of 28% while some taxpayers 
with lower incomes are taxed on part of their income at 33%. 
</P>
<P>
One of the key questions of the budget negotiations is whether in the long run 
Bush might agree to this change in return for congressional acceptance of his 
proposal to cut the capital gains tax rate. 
</P>
<P>
Having indicated that new taxes are necessary, Bush would risk a middle-class 
backlash if he argued against ensuring that the rich contribute a fair share to 
deficit reduction. At the same time, he risks a further undermining of his 
support on the right if he accepts higher income tax rates on the wealthiest 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
When a reporter observed that some members of the President's own staff have 
signaled that a deal might be reached with Democrats supporting a cut in 
capital gains taxes and Republicans supporting elimination of the income tax 
"bubble," Bush replied that he could not comment in detail. But he added: "I 
wouldn't put too much trust in that one." 
</P>
<P>
Democrats have been adamant about not going along with a capital gains tax cut, 
which Bush has strongly favored since his 1988 campaign, unless the President 
agrees to an increase in the rate at which the highest incomes are taxed. 
</P>
<P>
"The package should leave the federal tax code no less progressive than it is 
today," Rep. Don J. Pease (D-Ohio) said. "Over the past decade, low-income 
Americans have seen their real income go down and their real tax burden go up." 
</P>
<P>
Even as Bush defended his switch on taxes, budget negotiators, at their final 
session before the July 4 recess, debated how deeply to cut military spending, 
one of the most controversial issues of their talks. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.), ranking Republican on the Senate Budget 
Committee, sharply opposed a proposal by House Democrats to cut defense outlays 
by $16 billion in the first year and by $270 billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
Domenici contended that a reduction of $9 billion in the first year and a 
five-year cut of $150 billion would be preferble and not as disruptive as the 
plan advanced Thursday by Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Carmel Valley) and House 
Democratic leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a spirited debate," Gephardt said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said that 
there was disagreement on the size of the first-year cut but that everyone 
agreed that there would be a "substantial reduction" in Pentagon spending as 
part of a $50-billion deficit-cutting package. 
</P>
<P>
Gephardt, noting that the talks would be resumed on July 10, said: "We'll be 
prepared then to enter tough, serious negotiations" in hopes of reaching an 
agreement before Congress leaves town on Aug. 3 for a monthlong recess. 
</P>
<P>
Although Gephardt and Bush expressed hope that a budget accord could be reached 
before the August recess, partisan differences that must be resolved on both 
spending cuts and tax increases will make that timetable hard to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
After the initial flurry of questions about taxes, Bush was asked a question 
about the Middle East by Michael Gelb of Reuter. The President jumped on it, 
interrupting the question to say: "Good, Michael. I was hoping we'd get to 
another one." 
</P>
<P>
But, in the end, the President had little to say in response to the question, 
which focused on a letter he had just received from Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Shamir. "I am concerned about a deadlock in the peace process," Bush 
said. "The status quo is unacceptable to everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, who is pressing for the inclusion of Palestinians in talks with Israel, 
said: "We are not going to give up on that kind of solution to this problem." 
</P>
<P>
On the controversy over bailing out failed savings and loan institutions, Bush 
said: "The size of the savings and loan problem is terrible, and we are trying 
very hard to go after the criminals and to have in place rules and regulations 
so that this will never happen again, and to protect the depositors." 
</P>
<P>
The news conference took place just before Bush left Washington on a two-week 
trip that is taking him first to his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Me., then 
to a summit meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in London on July 
5 and 6, and then to Houston for the annual economic summit conference of the 
major industrial democracies. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the NATO meeting would make clear that the alliance, born at the 
start of the Cold War four decades ago, "has a broadened agenda besides just 
military." 
</P>
<P>
The President acknowledged that there are differences within the alliance over 
financial assistance for the Soviet Union. Such support has been favored by 
West Germany -- at a time when Bonn is seeking Soviet support for the 
unification of West Germany and East Germany -- but the United States has been 
reluctant to go along with such proposals.

Anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela came to Los Angeles Friday on the last leg 
of a taxing eight-city U.S. tour and in a series of addresses asked Hollywood 
celebrities and inner-city students alike to keep fighting against white 
minority-led rule in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony on the steps of City Hall, at a glitzy dinner and, finally, at a 
late-night '60s-style rally at a packed Coliseum, Mandela thanked Los Angeles 
for its "staunch" financial and political support in the crusade to end South 
Africa's apartheid system. 
</P>
<P>
"We could not have left the United States without visiting the city which daily 
nourished the dreams of millions of people the world over," Mandela told an 
estimated 70,000 people who filled the Coliseum, many waving fists and chanting 
his name. "Many would know Los Angeles as the unchallenged capital of motion 
pictures, many would regard your city as the city of glamour and splendor. 
</P>
<P>
"We who have suffered and continue to suffer the pain of oppression know that 
underneath that face of Los Angeles lies the great and noble spirit of the 
citizenry. We who fight for human rights know the depths of the human spirit 
running through the hills and valleys of the state of California." 
</P>
<P>
The reaction of the crowd to Mandela's words was swift and strong. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is the most fantastic thing in L.A. history," said a euphoric 
Victor Jackson. "L.A. has shown a unity that I didn't think existed. Anytime 
you can have this many people out in the fight against apartheid it's 
beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Locke, 30, of Culver City, echoed the unity theme. 
</P>
<P>
"I like the way the people in Los Angels turned out," said Locke. "I think the 
unity is contagious. I really feel it." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, at a midday ceremony at City Hall, Mandela looked weary but spoke 
firmly as he told several thousand people that America's "unsung heroes" have 
helped to build a "powerful, broad-based" movement that is approaching victory 
in the struggle against South Africa's policies of racial segregation. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela was hailed by movie stars and Mayor Tom Bradley, who called him a 
"kindred spirit" of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
"In our youth, Hollywood was the stuff of dreams," Mandela said on the steps of 
City Hall, with actor Gregory Peck presiding over the event. "In a sense, our 
youthful dreams, to some extent, are being realized." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "We are particularly overjoyed to be in this city because Los 
Angeles is a staunch supporter of the anti-apartheid movement." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Los Angeles is seen as key to tour organizers' goal of raising 
millions of dollars to underwrite social and political work by Mandela's 
African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated $1.2 million was raised by a reception Friday evening at the 
Exposition Park Armory, and 70,000 $10 tickets for a rally at the Los Angeles 
Memorial Coliseum were sold -- making it a sellout crowd, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, tens of thousands of people flocked to the Coliseum -- on foot, in 
buses and even in stretch limousines -- to hear rap music, gospel and folk 
songs as a prelude to Mandela's second Los Angeles speech. Hundreds of youths, 
following behind African drums mounted on a flatbed truck, marched four miles 
to the rally. 
</P>
<P>
Scalpers outside tried to hawk tickets for $20 and vendors did a brisk T-shirt 
and Mandela-button business. 
</P>
<P>
Turning to the thousands of youth who joined in the Coliseum rally, Mandela 
offered an unusually direct and personal message. He said he understood the 
"joy and pain" of American youth today but warned against using drugs to 
"escape reality." 
</P>
<P>
"We learned we could make the future bright by overcoming our own weaknesses 
and the weaknesses of others," he said. "It is our common responsibility to 
never give up hope. We must all (work) to make the world a better place." 
</P>
<P>
The crowd gave Mandela a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people break down in jail, but Mandela outlived a lot of the people who 
put him behind bars," said Reuben White, 41, of Mandela's 27 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"You must have patience like that to pass the cause on to the children," added 
White, a communications teacher who brought his 12-year-old son to the Coliseum 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
While the Coliseum event was packed, the crowd that assembled earlier for 
Mandela's midday address at City Hall was considerably smaller than the throng 
of well-wishers that organizers had hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Fire Department officials estimated that 4,000 to 5,000 
people gathered at City Hall; the police, who first estimated crowd size at 
3,000, later revised the figure to about 15,000. 
</P>
<P>
"How it got from 2,500 at 12:30 to 15,000 (two hours later), I can't explain," 
Los Angeles Police Lt. Fred Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
Whichever the figure, it fell far short of the 30,000 that organizers were 
predicting. When the Dodgers won the World Series in 1988, an estimated 70,000 
people crowded City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and program organizers said they were not overly concerned about 
the turnout. 
</P>
<P>
On the political front, the Los Angeles City Council, seizing on Mandela's 
visit, voted Friday to close loopholes in a city measure that will keep the 
city from doing business with companies that have ties to South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who turns 72 next month, said his 12-day odyssey through the United 
States, where he has addressed huge crowds in Harlem, laid a wreath at King's 
grave and met with President Bush, has been "exhausting but exhilarating." 
</P>
<P>
"Wherever we went, we were met with the milk of human kindness," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the finest tribute we can pay to your wonderful, warm, 
generous and compassionate people is to intensify the anti-apartheid struggle 
on all fronts," Mandela added. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela arrived midday, about two hours late, aboard a chartered Trump Shuttle 
which landed at a remote tarmac of the Los Angeles International Airport. He 
then sped to City Hall in a motorcade as his security entourage closed the 
eastbound lanes of the Santa Monica freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Reaching City Hall, Mandela met briefly with Bradley in private, then emerged 
to see the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the morning, rumors circulated that concern over Mandela's stamina 
would force organizers to pare back the tour. 
</P>
<P>
They considered canceling his last stop, Oakland, but decided to go ahead with 
it, a source on the welcoming committee said. 
</P>
<P>
However, his schedule in Los Angeles is being curtailed. According to the 
committee source, Mandela's doctor had insisted he skip the City Hall event, 
while organizers insisted he appear. In addition to his age and unrelenting 
schedule, Mandela recently underwent surgery for the removal of a benign cyst 
from his bladder. 
</P>
<P>
Compromise was reached when it was agreed that Mandela would omit a scheduled 
speech before the City Council but would appear before the waiting crowd, which 
had begun gathering early. 
</P>
<P>
As Mandela moved across a platform outside City Hall, the audience chanted 
"Nelson" and "Amandla" -- the Zulu word for "power" -- but then grew impatient 
as local politicians took their turns to speak -- finally booing Bradley and 
City Council President John Ferraro as each took a turn at the microphone. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Peck, the star-studded roster of dignitaries included Sidney 
Poitier, Dionne Warwick, Robert Guillaume, Cicely Tyson and Muhammad Ali. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the impressive list of luminaries, there was no mistaking the star 
of the show. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing's going to stop me from getting a snapshot of him -- not even the 
FBI," vowed Ann Marie Dumas, 21, of Glendale, clutching a disposable camera on 
the steps of City Hall. "I'm gonna blow it up, put it in a frame and hang it in 
my living room -- right next to my world map and picture of Martin Luther King 
Jr." 
</P>
<P>
On 1st Street in front of the stage, standing atop a bus shelter, six young men 
and a small boy unfurled a blue banner that said, "Greetings Mandela From the 
Homeless." 
</P>
<P>
Hermine Johnigan, a 64-year-old retired schoolteacher from Los Angeles, had the 
privilege of shaking Mandela's hand on the Spring Street steps of City Hall. 
She was one of about 50 members off Los Angelenas, a volunteer organization of 
women who work with the city protocol office. Wearing yellow dresses, the women 
lined the red carpet that Mandela followed up the steps to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"It made me feel very humble. It made me feel very good that I am living in 
this century to witness the changes in relations between blacks and whites," 
said Johnigan, who is black. 
</P>
<P>
Johnigan said she firmly grasped Mandela's hand. "I took both of his hands and 
said, 'We've been waiting a long time, God bless you.' And he said, 'Thank 
you.' " 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to wash this hand for a week," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd that heard Mandela at City Hall had to deal with rigidly zealous 
security guards, blocked-off streets, a poor acoustical system and intense 
sunshine -- factors that may have kept people away. 
</P>
<P>
Darlene Donloe, a spokeswoman for the local Mandela Reception Committee, said 
she was "not at all" disappointed in the crowd size -- one of the smallest 
public gatherings of the U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
Some organizers said Mandela's late arrival -- after the lunch hour had 
concluded -- and rampant rumors he might not go to City Hall until late in the 
afternoon may have contributed to the turnout. 
</P>
<P>
Security surrounding Mandela's arrival was tight. Police and State Department 
security agents roped off City Hall, inspected the area with bomb-sniffing dogs 
and required anyone entering the building to go through a metal detector. 
</P>
<P>
Later, security agents conducted body searches of people arriving at the 
Coliseum. But no incidents were reported. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was fairly subdued until rappers Tone Loc and Ice-T took the stage. 
Thousands of fans waved clenched fists and danced at their seats. 
</P>
<P>
Pepe Fernandez, a 65-year-old black Cuban immigrant who attended the rally, 
reflected on his civil rights work in Texas during the '50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the struggles I've seen in the South, I know what it takes for a 
black man to succeed," Fernandez said. "There will be a time when people in 
this country will realize that the color of a man's skin means nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Alabama native Charles Smith, 69, sat in his wheelchair at a far end of the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
"We suffered, but not as much as Mandela," Smith said, comparing the old 
American South with today's South Africa. "No one in America can say they 
suffered as much as the people in South Africa, as bad as the South was." 
</P>
<P>
Early in the evening, a small twin-engine plane circled above the Coliseum, 
trailing a banner that said, "Palestinians Welcome Mandela." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who has angered some Jewish groups with his stated support for 
Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, met Friday evening 
with Natan Sharansky, the former Refusenik who was jailed for eight years in 
the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela came to Los Angeles from Detroit, where he spoke to about 50,000 people 
at Tiger Stadium Thursday night. At dawn Friday, he took a stroll wearing a cap 
and jacket from the NBA champion Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
Asked in Detroit about his health, Mandela said he felt fine, flashing two 
thumbs-up signs. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to test this, just bring some boxing gloves," he told reporters. 
</P>

LITHUANIANS GIVE IN, AGREE TO MORATORIUM

The would-be independent nation of Lithuania, ground down by Kremlin economic 
sanctions and months of pressure, gave in Friday to Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev and agreed to suspend its independence declaration for 100 days if 
talks begin with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
"Two years ago, we chose the peaceful route to independence, the route of 
negotiations," President Vytautas Landsbergis told the Parliament of his small 
Baltic land as he reversed position and urged adoption of the largely symbolic 
measure. "Now the condition for negotiations is a moratorium." 
</P>
<P>
Formerly, Lithuania's leaders said the unilateral proclamation of independence 
adopted by the Parliament on March 11 was untouchable. By voting 69-35 for a 
conditional suspension, they yielded to a key demand from Gorbachev and 
acknowledged that Lithuania, a Soviet republic for 50 years, was still 
something less than totally sovereign and independent. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeking negotiations does not mean a retreat -- it means a step forward to 
independence," Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, one of the original 
advocates of a moratorium, said during the often heated Parliament debate that 
began Thursday and ran for nine hours. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate reaction in Moscow to the vote by Lithuania's Supreme 
Council, as the Parliament is called, but it seemed a clear-cut victory for 
Gorbachev, who is also faced with governments in the neighboring Baltic 
republics of Latvia and Estonia that are bent on independence, as well as 
rising demands for autonomy from minority groups throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
By forcing the Lithuanians to backtrack, Gorbachev made them an example for 
other restive ethnic groups and dramatically reasserted his personal authority, 
which is expected to be under fierce attack from hard-line Communists and 
radicals at a national party congress that opens Monday. 
</P>
<P>
According to officials in Vilnius, Lithuania's capital, the deal offering a 
moratorium in exchange for the opening of negotiations was worked out at two 
meetings between Gorbachev and Landsbergis earlier in the week, as both sides 
searched for an end to the standoff. 
</P>
<P>
It was not certain, however, whether the 100-day period would be enough to 
satisfy the Soviet leader. 
</P>
<P>
The document adopted by the Supreme Council says "the independent Lithuanian 
state, seeking bilateral negotiations between the republic of Lithuania and the 
U.S.S.R., declares from the start of negotiations, a unilateral 100-day 
moratorium on the act of March 11, 1990, suspending all legal action arising 
from this act." 
</P>
<P>
The March declaration, passed by the Supreme Council after little debate, had 
proclaimed the restoration of the independence Lithuania enjoyed between the 
world wars and before Soviet dictator Josef Stalin engineered its annexation by 
the Kremlin in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who has pledged to oppose the breakup of the Soviet Union, denounced 
the March declaration as illegal and hence invalid, and deployed an array of 
pressure tactics to bring the government of the Ireland-size republic to heel. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet troops seized some government and Communist Party buildings in Vilnius, 
and armored columns rumbled through the streets with the evident aim of showing 
residents that Moscow had the means of reasserting control. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the central government shut off all shipments of crude oil and most 
of the natural gas to the resource-poor republic. In the 10 weeks since, about 
50,000 workers have reportedly lost their jobs, and Landsbergis has said the 
economy has suffered $173 million in losses. 
</P>
<P>
Prunskiene told Parliament that it had to agree to concessions, in part because 
Lithuania's economy could be ruined by winter if the sanctions remained in 
force. 
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis, the leader of the grass-roots group Sajudis that led the 
successful two-year campaign for the proclamation of Lithuania's restored 
independence, was at pains to stress that Lithuanian resolve had not been 
vanquished by months of Kremlin arm-twisting. He said he changed his mind and 
was supporting a freeze of the independence declaration because the wording 
adopted after consideration of at least a dozen rival versions was not 
automatic or unconditional. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not an immediate moratorium," he told reporters after the vote. "It is a 
promise of a moratorium under certain conditions. We are making a step toward 
an agreement. The next step should come from Moscow." 
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian leader said Gorbachev had assured him and Prunskiene earlier 
that the economic sanctions would be lifted as soon as a moratorium was 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate indication when the partial economic blockade might be 
lifted, or when talks with the central government on a negotiated secession 
from the Soviet Union might begin. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the republic of 3.8 million consider the 50 years of Soviet rule as 
occupation by a foreign power, and outside the building in Vilnius where the 
Supreme Council meets, dozens of hard-line nationalists assembled to oppose the 
idea of tampering with the March declaration. 
</P>
<P>
"A moratorium is the death of independence," one demonstrator's sign said. 
Others denounced Kremlin "blackmail" or branded Prunskiene, who endorsed the 
idea of a moratorium two weeks ago, "a traitor to Lithuania." 
</P>
<P>
As radios blared a live transmission of the proceedings inside, a small group 
of people waved the yellow-green-red flag of independent Lithuania trimmed with 
black ribbon as a symbol of lament. 
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers objected that the moratorium would be more valuable to 
Gorbachev, now prey to intense criticism from both the Soviet left and right, 
than to Lithuania. 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Council fell silent after the vote, from which two deputies 
abstained. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously wary of the possibility that Gorbachev could impose direct 
presidential rule, the lawmakers granted themselves an escape clause by 
stipulating that they could cancel or prolong the moratorium and said it would 
automatically be lifted if the Supreme Council were unable to perform its 
duties for some reason. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has said he is in favor of the constitutional right of the 15 
constituent Soviet republics to secede, but insists that they follow newly 
established procedures that could engage them in a five-year process of 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his support for the moratorium, Landsbergis sounded a warning, saying 
such talks with Kremlin representatives, far from marking the start of a more 
relaxed phase, would be the beginning of new trials as the Soviet government 
fights tenaciously to safeguard its prerogatives and interests. 
</P>
<P>
"The true tension and crisis is not the present, it is still distant," he said. 
"When we come closer to the negotiating table . . . then all the little animals 
will be unleashed: slander, quarrel, provocation, threats and all types of 
pressure. Let us prepare."

BUSH VETOES BILL GRANTING FAMILY LEAVES; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: HE OBJECTS TO GOVERNMENT MANDATING SUCH WORKPLACE ISSUES. DESPITE 
CRITICISM, AN OVERRIDE BY CONGRESS IS VIEWED AS UNLIKELY.

President Bush -- who as a candidate stressed the need to give workers time off 
to care for seriously ill family members or newly arrived children -- Friday 
vetoed a bill that would have required larger employers to provide up to 12 
weeks of unpaid family leave. 
</P>
<P>
"I strongly object . . . to the federal government mandating leave policies for 
America's employers and work force," the President said in a written statement 
issued at the White House as he began a five-day visit to his vacation home in 
Kennebunkport, Me. 
</P>
<P>
Although the President's action prompted an immediate storm of criticism, it 
appeared likely that he would be able to muster enough support to sustain his 
13th veto when Congress returns from its July Fourth recess. 
</P>
<P>
While stating that parental leave is an important employee benefit, Bush said: 
"We must ensure that federal policies do not stifle the creation of new jobs, 
nor result in the elimination of existing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"If our nation's employers are to succeed in an increasingly complex and 
competitive global marketplace, they must have the flexibility to meet both 
this challenge and the needs of their employees," Bush said, suggesting as he 
had during the acrimonious debate over the measure that competition for workers 
eventually would force employers to grant the leave. 
</P>
<P>
But this "voluntary" approach puts the President in conflict with even some of 
his most loyal Republican supporters, who saw the measure as an opportunity to 
demonstrate his support for family oriented issues at a time when his 
anti-abortion position has come under fire. 
</P>
<P>
"This is bad policy and bad politics," said Rep. Marge Roukema (R-N.J.), one of 
a relatively small number of Republicans who supported the bill in the House. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking privately, Democrats acknowledged that they probably lack the 
two-thirds majority required to override Bush's veto. The measure passed by a 
vote of 237 to 187 in the House. Proponents would need to pick up at least 61 
additional votes to overcome the veto. In the Senate, the bill was passed on a 
voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the general election campaign in 1988, Bush proposed a number 
of domestic initiatives, seeking to distance himself from some of the social 
policies of the Ronald Reagan Administration in which he served as vice 
president for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
The bill the President vetoed would require firms with 50 or more workers, as 
well as state and local governments, to grant employees as much as 12 weeks of 
unpaid leave for specified family or medical reasons without losing any health 
insurance coverage during their absences. Federal employees would be entitled 
to longer leave periods under the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Employers would be required to guarantee the jobs of workers taking the unpaid 
leaves. The bill would exempt companies with fewer than 50 employees, and it 
includes exemptions for high-paid employees. 
</P>
<P>
A study by the General Accounting Office, the congressional watchdog agency, 
found that the measure would affect 5% of all employers, while covering 44% of 
the work force. 
</P>
<P>
Among Democratic leaders, the veto prompted a volley of sharp criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"The President should be ashamed for vetoing this bill and making a mockery of 
the term 'family values,' " said House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt 
(D-Mo.). 
</P>
<P>
Gephardt suggested that Congress might pass another version of the bill later 
this year, forcing Bush to repeat his veto closer to election day. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm stunned by the cynicism that this veto reveals," said Judith Lichtman, 
president of the Women's Legal Defense Fund and head of a coalition of labor, 
church and other groups that lobbied for the bill. "President Bush doesn't care 
about American families. He really only cares about big business." 
</P>
<P>
The President's action was endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "The 
federal government has no role in dictating national employment policy," said 
Christine A. Russell, the Chamber's chief liaison officer with the House of 
Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
And John Sloan, president of the National Federation of Independent Business, 
said that the measure "could have destroyed American business' flexibility by 
restricting business growth, damaging productivity and reducing the number of 
available jobs."

UPDATE / VIETNAMESE REFUGEES;

<P>
NEW CHALLENGE RAISED TO 'BOAT PEOPLE' ACCORD

The refusal of the United States and Vietnam to agree to the forced 
repatriation of Vietnamese "boat people" has raised a new challenge to the 
decade-old international agreement that has allowed hundreds of thousands of 
Vietnamese to find refuge in the United States, Canada and other Western 
countries, according to refugee officials. 
</P>
<P>
Britain and six countries of Southeast Asia have warned that unless Washington 
and Hanoi change their minds by Sunday, they will consider themselves free to 
act independently in dealing with the Vietnamese refugee crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's scrambling to find some kind of solution," a Western official who 
works with refugees said. "The fear is that we are going to start seeing boat 
people pushed out to sea in great numbers." 
</P>
<P>
At stake is a 1979 accord on "first asylum," under which Hong Kong, a British 
colony, agreed along with Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia and 
the Philippines to give boat people temporary shelter with the understanding 
that Western nations guaranteed to resettle them later. 
</P>
<P>
Following a flood of new refugees last year, Western countries and the 
Southeast Asian countries adopted a Comprehensive Plan of Action that provided 
for screening the refugees to weed out so-called economic migrants from genuine 
political refugees. But last year's agreement did not make clear what should be 
done with those who are screened out. 
</P>
<P>
Britain and the Southeast Asian countries have argued repeatedly that the only 
solution to the problem is to send those who are deemed economic migrants back 
to Vietnam. The United States and Vietnam have opposed this plan. 
</P>
<P>
The crisis has worsened since last spring, when Malaysia implemented a policy 
of intercepting refugee boats and shoving them off toward Indonesia. Despite 
official denials, refugee officials insist that about 8,500 people have been 
turned away. 
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has reportedly started offering to repair the boats of refugees 
arriving there and begun giving them fuel and charts for Australia. Earlier in 
June, the Philippine government refused for two weeks to receive 255 Vietnamese 
who had been picked up by U.S. warships. 
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asian governments have said that if the United States cannot 
countenance forced returns, it should build a holding center on the island of 
Guam. Washington has rejected the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Refugee officials say they are concerned that countries such as Thailand and 
Indonesia could begin following the Malaysian example next week if U.S. policy 
is not changed. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Hanson, refugee coordinator for Hong Kong, which has always granted 
first asylum, said his government would take no new action until after an 
upcoming refugee conference in Geneva.

<P>
The Soviet Communist Party, led by General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev, will 
open its first national congress since 1986 on Monday, with the party openly 
divided for the first time since the early years of Soviet power. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, its prestige is sliding just as Gorbachev's reforms make it 
vital that Communists muster voter support to retain power or lose out to rival 
parties and political formations that are now legal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Issues 
</P>
<P>
For the 4,683 elected delegates who convene in the Kremlin Palace of 
Congresses, the daunting goal will be to chart the future role of the party in 
fast-changing Soviet society, as well as shaping the internal machinery of the 
party itself, including revamping and possibly replacing supreme organs like 
the Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
As a separate gathering of Communists from the Russian Federation, the largest 
Soviet republic, made clear this month, the glasnost-era congress will produce 
vociferous attacks on Gorbachev's perestroika reforms from both radicals and 
orthodox Communists. Each member of the ruling Politburo could be called on to 
account for his tenure in office. In a secret-ballot election for party leader, 
direct challenges may be mounted to Gorbachev, who is also the Soviet 
president. 
</P>
<P>
The congress, in theory the supreme institution of the 18-million-member party, 
also will be called upon to adopt a new party program and rules and could be 
the occasion for sweeping changes in personnel, from members of the Central 
Committee to the Politburo itself. 
</P>
<P>
To allow Gorbachev to retain his place as party leader while freeing him from 
most operational duties, a party chairmanship with fewer responsibilities may 
be created. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Background 
</P>
<P>
Unlike in Eastern Europe, no other group in Soviet society comes close to 
having the clout and the experience in government of the party once headed by 
V. I. Lenin. 
</P>
<P>
But political changes engineered by Gorbachev have forced Communists to seek 
new ways of exercising authority. If the party does not adapt, Gorbachev warned 
recently, "it will find itself on the sidelines of history." 
</P>
<P>
He wants party organizations all the way from Moscow to the villages of Siberia 
to get out of running the day-to-day affairs of the country and set strategic 
and ideological goals instead. He also wants to retain a unified national party 
apparatus, but to grant more leeway to Communists in the constituent Soviet 
republics to decide local affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The party, now losing members and linked by many Soviet people to the bloody 
terror of Josef Stalin and the official corruption of the Brezhnev era, is 
conscious that both it and society as a whole are in crisis, or something near 
it. 
</P>
<P>
According to Pravda, the party's chief newspaper, more than half of a group of 
citizens surveyed in June did not consider the party the leading force in 
Soviet life. 
</P>
<P>
Ideological factions have also appeared to doom the "monolithic Leninism" of 
the past, and the congress will be an arena where the 100 delegates who are 
members of the radical Democratic Platform group can wage ideological war on 
the ultra-orthodox Marxist faction, or the more mainstream delegates who 
support the Gorbachev line. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Personalities 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev will undoubtedly occupy center stage at the congress, as he has in 
Soviet political life as a whole since becoming party chief. But there are 
indications that all 12 members of the Politburo will be individually open to 
criticism from the floor after each reports on his work. 
</P>
<P>
Yegor K. Ligachev, the leading Politburo conservative, who recently questioned 
the wisdom of Gorbachev's "regulated market" economic reforms, has specifically 
said he welcomes the opportunity to speak. The congress should also resolve the 
political fates of Politburo members such as Lev N. Zaikov, 67, the onetime 
Moscow party boss, and Vitaly I. Vorotnikov, 64, who did not even try to 
contest maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin's successful attempt to succeed him 
as president of the Russian Federation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scenarios 
</P>
<P>
There are several possible outcomes of the congress: 
</P>
<P>
The party reaches critical mass, and Democratic Platform and ultra-right 
delegates walk out to form alternative parties also laying claim to the 
Communist label, further fracturing Gorbachev's original power base. 
</P>
<P>
Through Gorbachev's personal diplomacy and intentional vagueness in party 
pronouncements, a broad enough ideological umbrella is found to prevent an open 
split among Communists, even if individual delegates walk out to protest what 
they claim is a veering to the left or right. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev relinquishes the job of general secretary of the party to focus on 
his presidential duties, but is named to the new party chairmanship and names a 
progressive ally to take charge of the party's day-to-day affairs.

<P>
The Soviet Communist Party, putting aside its sharp differences for the moment, 
voted Friday to approve without dissent the proposals that President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev will present to a crucial party congress next week for further 
political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The party's policy-making Central Committee also endorsed for presentation to 
the congress a new party platform and plans for the party's reorganization, 
both of which Gorbachev has sought to recover the lost momentum of perestroika, 
as his reform program is known. 
</P>
<P>
The congress will open Monday, as scheduled, despite suggestions this week that 
it be postponed to allow Gorbachev's supporters to recover from a harsh, 
all-out attack on perestroika at a party conference earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who outlined to the committee the main points of his report, 
stressed the need to consolidate the increasingly divided party as well as to 
press ahead with the reforms, a party spokesman said after the Kremlin meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the discussion of Gorbachev's report as "constructive and cordial," 
Alexander S. Kapto, the head of the Central Committee's ideology department, 
implied that the fierce political infighting of recent weeks had been suspended 
so that the party could proceed with the congress and the full-fledged debate 
that will decide the nation's course. 
</P>
<P>
But Boris N. Yeltsin, the president of Russia, the largest Soviet republic, 
said Gorbachev had indeed come under strong criticism for the proposals he will 
make in the report. 
</P>
<P>
"There were remarks about the report, and very serious ones at that," Yeltsin, 
a Central Committee member, said in an interview on the main nightly news 
program, "Vremya." "But our real arguments are ahead of us." 
</P>
<P>
The committee left unresolved the highly contentious issue of the future 
structure of the party leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kapto suggested a consensus had emerged that the party leader should 
also be the country's president, combining the powers in the hands of one 
person, he acknowledged that doubts remain about this and about Gorbachev's 
proposal to transform his present post as the party's general secretary into a 
new position, party chairman, and thus free himself of many small issues. 
</P>
<P>
Yegor K. Ligachev, the foremost conservative within the Soviet leadership, 
declared in an interview published here Friday that he had "absolute 
confidence" in Gorbachev's authority, notwithstanding his recent criticism of 
Gorbachev's policies and his call this month for a division of the presidency 
and the party leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The party congress must focus on the fate of the nation and the party rather 
than individuals, Ligachev told the newspaper Workers' Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
Fears persist among Soviet liberals that, with the strong conservative trend in 
many sections of the party, Gorbachev will have to battle to protect, let alone 
promote, his reform program. 
</P>
<P>
In a sharply worded commentary, a political analyst for the official news 
agency Tass warned Friday that Gorbachev and his supporters must receive "the 
party's mandate to deepen reforms" if the party and the country as a whole are 
to emerge from a deepening series of crises. 
</P>
<P>
"A lapse or a deliberate rejection of perestroika would be fraught with 
disaster -- and not for the party alone," analyst Andrei Orlov wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Although the party itself had chosen Gorbachev as its leader five years ago and 
then launched the reform process, it has lost much of its drive, Orlov said in 
an unusually critical assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an obvious discrepancy between the correct decisions and the open 
resistance to reforms on the part of some party functionaries, who are 
increasingly aware of the real challenge to their once-undisputed power," Orlov 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"This leads to a fall in the party's prestige and disappointment of its 
numerous rank-and-file members," he added. "Ever more people are leaving the 
party. Criticism is becoming sharper of its role as a force responsible for the 
economic, social, ethnic and, indeed, political crisis in society." 
</P>
<P>
Kapto said that, after the debate on Gorbachev's report, the 249-member 
committee had told the ruling Politburo to "rework it to take into account the 
discussion," but this was largely to make sections of it more specific. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest change, ironically, was in the name. Originally, Gorbachev's report 
was entitled "The Course of Perestroika and the Party's Tasks -- Report of the 
Central Committee." At the insistence of committee members, it was changed to 
"Political Report of the Central Committee to the 28th Party Congress and the 
Party's Tasks." 
</P>
<P>
The committee appeared to be distancing itself from Gorbachev's proposals and 
sticking to a traditional formula for the general secretary's reports to the 
party. 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev was also asked to make "a political assessment" of the Russian 
Communist Party's recent congress, which demonstrated the growing strength of 
the party's resurgent conservative wing. That is certain to set the scene for a 
political donnybrook since conservatives may well hold half or even more of the 
seats at the congress. 
</P>
<P>
The Russian party's stand was so conservative that dozens of Communist Party 
organizations around Russia are refusing to become, automatically, members of 
the Russian Communist Party, and they are demanding that they be allowed to 
retain their positions in the Soviet Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
The Russian congress and, to a lesser extent, that of the Ukrainian Communist 
Party developed into an unprecedented onslaught against Gorbachev and 
perestroika earlier this month, and that prompted Gorbachev supporters to 
consider postponing the national party congress until the autumn, in an attempt 
to slow the conservatives' momentum. 
</P>
<P>
Kapto said, however, that the Central Committee had confirmed the opening of 
the congress on Monday and that there had been no discussion of delaying it. 
Originally planned for a week, the congress is now likely to run at least 10 
days, Kapto added. 
</P>
<P>
The congress will draw 4,683 elected delegates from around the country, plus 
350 representatives of workers and farmers, who are now vastly outnumbered by 
party and government officials. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also discussed a threat by miners at 25 mines around the country 
to strike on July 11, just as the congress is finishing, unless the party and 
Soviet authorities meet their demands for independent trade unions and the 
removal of the party officials who control the army, the police, the judiciary 
and the school system.

Yelena Yershova's glance shifted nervously from the 30 children in her charge 
to a steely-eyed policeman keeping watch over the silent procession to view 
V.I. Lenin's embalmed and enshrined body. 
</P>
<P>
"They should bury him," the nurse from provincial Istra remarked in a whisper, 
shielding her young sanatorium patients from an opinion that her fellow 
pilgrims might consider sacrilege. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a normal man," she said, reluctantly nudging along the ritual summer 
field trip. "And it's abnormal to display a corpse for so many years." 
</P>
<P>
Such an assessment of the Soviet Union's founding father could have been 
condemned as an act of heresy only a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
But as Soviet citizens struggle through an ideological identity crisis in a 
world that has all but abandoned communism, they have been forced for the first 
time since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution to re-examine Lenin's theories, his 
role in history and even what to do with his deified remains. 
</P>
<P>
For some Soviet citizens, the reassessment is a welcome outgrowth of the 
reforms that have broken longstanding taboos against honest reflection on how 
the nation founded by Lenin has evolved into a state in perpetual crisis. 
</P>
<P>
But for the vast majority of Soviet people schooled to revere Lenin in the 
place of the god he disdained as the people's opiate, Lenin's reduced standing 
in world esteem is the final indignity to be borne by a nation mired in a 
failing political experiment. 
</P>
<P>
Bronze and marble images of the Soviet founding father have been firebombed in 
Poland, hanged in effigy in Romania, toppled in Hungary, defaced in East 
Germany and wrapped in a cocoon of anti-Communist slogans in Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
In his native land, the ubiquitous Lenin statues have been clandestinely 
vandalized and his revolutionary philosophies publicly attacked. Even in the 
halls of the Moscow City Council, a giant bust of Lenin that has adorned 
political sessions for decades was turned to face the wall a few days ago. 
</P>
<P>
Emotional assaults on his figurative presence in the newly democratized nations 
of Eastern Europe are understood by some Soviet people as the venting of 
pent-up rage by victims against a symbol of the system that repressed them. 
</P>
<P>
But mounting calls from within the country to reassess Lenin's legacy have 
embedded doubts in the devoted masses who see the shift from official idolatry 
as a denigration of their last unblemished hero. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he made mistakes, and some may have had serious consequences for us, and 
not all of his policies were appropriate even to the times," historian Roy A. 
Medvedev observed in an interview on the eve of the 28th Communist Party 
Congress, at which the very future of Leninism will be determined. "But no one 
can change the fact that he was the founder of the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
While Lenin faces no serious challenge to his domestic standing, Medvedev 
argued, his tumble abroad was preordained because of the Soviet party's hand in 
imposing dictatorship in Lenin's name. 
</P>
<P>
"For the Soviet people, the attacks on Lenin in Eastern Europe have not had any 
tremendous effect. Soviet people are consumed with their own problems," 
Medvedev said. "These events might have upset the politicians and diplomats, 
but not the general population. If they are concerned about foreign public 
opinion, it is that of America, not Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
No broad-scale trimming of Lenin's historical stature is needed, Medvedev said. 
But he applauded recent disclosures in Soviet periodicals of Lenin's political 
misjudgments, and even that he had a mistress, as a necessary humanizing of a 
figure too often placed above mortal weakness. 
</P>
<P>
Until the past year, Lenin's image had been untouchable since his death in 
1924. 
</P>
<P>
Dictator Josef Stalin transformed him into a deity. Icon corners for worship in 
czarist schoolhouses were replaced with "Lenin Corners" during Stalin's 29-year 
rule. To this day, political altars and devotional testimonies surround the 
revolutionary's sage countenance in every classroom. 
</P>
<P>
Hardly a city in the Soviet Union lacks a Lenin Square or a towering figure of 
the founder at its center. Countless towns, ships, oil fields and collective 
farms bear his name. 
</P>
<P>
Lenin's fall from grace abroad was triggered by the spread of anti-Communist 
revolution that began peacefully in Poland last spring and swept through to 
Romania by the end of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
His memory in the Soviet Union was seriously punctured last spring, with 
posthumous publication of Vassily Grossman's 1963 novel "Everything Flows," 
tracing Stalin's terror back to the foundation laid by Lenin. 
</P>
<P>
"Bolsheviks did not believe in the value of personal freedom, freedom of speech 
and press," Grossman wrote. "They, like Lenin himself, considered those 
freedoms . . . insignificant." 
</P>
<P>
In the months leading up to the crucial party congress, the search for 
socialism's earliest errors has repeatedly cast aspersions on the teachings of 
Lenin. A book by a top playwright blames Lenin for the "crime of the century," 
the 1918 murder of ousted Czar Nicholas II and his family. Deputies to the 
Russian republic's parliament have demanded investigation of the revolution led 
by Lenin. 
</P>
<P>
The accusations prompted an outcry during April observances of the 120th 
anniversary of Lenin's birth, an occasion that drew words of caution even from 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"It is high time we put an end to the absurd idolization of Lenin," Gorbachev 
said. "Now we know the aim of this too well. But we condemn wholeheartedly the 
desecration of his memory, whatever form it takes in this country or abroad." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev alluded to the cunning of Stalin, who transformed the departed Lenin 
into a figure of worship to place party doctrine -- and the dictator's actions 
-- beyond reproach. 
</P>
<P>
It was at Stalin's insistence that Lenin's remains were embalmed and displayed 
for future generations, and Stalin was enshrined alongside Lenin in the red 
marble mausoleum for eight years after his death in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the recent controversy over Lenin's place in history has been channeled 
into debate over whether to bury his remains and break with the 66-year 
tradition of preserving his image in the manner of an icon. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how much we hate a person, no matter how much we love him, we don't 
have the right to deprive a person of burial," theater director Mark Zakharov 
urged during a televised talk show last year. 
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary Deputy Yuri Karyakin proposed a month later that authorities give 
serious consideration to interment. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestion, which may resurface at the party congress that begins Monday, 
sparked an emotional public outcry. 
</P>
<P>
"A man of Lenin's stature should be preserved by special means for all to see," 
said Khuzhaboi Yusupov, a 31-year-old chemical worker from Uzbekistan who, as 
thousands do each weekday, stood for hours to be admitted to the mausoleum. 
</P>
<P>
Preservation of the body, which some contend is a wax replica, is becoming an 
increasingly difficult task, requiring periodic closures for cosmetic 
adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
"The embalming of Lenin was not just Stalin's wily action to make a place of 
worship for the party. It has become a cultural tradition and a symbol of an 
era, and that is something we have to respect," said Ivan I. Antonovich, a 
prominent social scientist on the staff of the party Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
He said he personally advocates a closed tomb to "end the indignity" of public 
display that Lenin has been exposed to. But Antonovich said the issue is beyond 
the party's resolution: "The broad masses will never allow the reburial of 
Lenin."

HUD RECOVERS $81 MILLION AFTER AUDITS

The Department of Housing and Urban Development is recovering about $81 million 
of federal funds lost through widespread fraud and mismanagement, HUD's 
inspector general said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The department recovered $18.6 million in the six-month reporting period as a 
result of our audits and investigations, and HUD management made commitments to 
recover another $62.3 million," Inspector General Paul Adams told a Senate 
Banking Committee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
That amount would be only a small fraction of the estimated $6 billion to $8 
billion lost by the department during the eight-year term of former HUD 
Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. The estimate comes from congressional committees 
investigating HUD. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce is under investigation by an independent prosecutor over his role in the 
scandal. He has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said 185 individuals and firms had been indicted in the six months that 
ended last March, and 144 had been convicted. 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Louise Harrell, a former HUD official, was recently sentenced to 46 
months in prison and fined $600,000 after being convicted of embezzling $5.5 
million from the department. 
</P>
<P>
Adams said about 700 cases were being investigated, many of them with the help 
of the FBI, and 200 more cases are awaiting action by U.S. attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
He said current HUD Secretary Jack Kemp was making changes in management and 
policy that were eliminating the abuses. 
</P>
<P>
"The Kemp team has, with the cooperation of Congress, begun to initiate 
numerous corrective actions, and it won't be very much longer before our 
reports begin focusing on the effectiveness of those actions," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic that HUD is going in the right direction."

PANEL OBJECTS TO PROPOSED STUDY OF BREAST CANCER DRUG;

A federal advisory panel recommended Friday that the Food and Drug 
Administration reject a proposal to undertake a ground-breaking U.S.-Soviet 
study of 20,000 women to determine whether a hormonal drug can prevent breast 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA's Oncology Drugs Advisory Committee agreed that a long-term study 
should be conducted to determine the effect of the hormonal drug tamoxifen in 
preventing breast cancer and other cancers in healthy women. 
</P>
<P>
But the panel said that its members had concluded that the design of the 
proposed 10-year, $100-million study of women in the United States and the 
Soviet Union was flawed. The committee said that it would recommend ways to 
correct the deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed for the women of the country," said Phillip D. Bretz, 
director of the Desert Breast Institute in Rancho Mirage and one of the 
proposed study leaders. "I felt it was time to do it. None of these answers are 
going to be resolved until this study is done." 
</P>
<P>
Although the recommendation of an FDA advisory committee is not binding, it 
typically wields considerable weight in agency decision-making. The FDA must 
approve the U.S. segment of the study before it can begin. 
</P>
<P>
The committee said there was insufficient information on how the study would be 
conducted, including recruitment of patients and handling of data. Some members 
also expressed concern that the volunteers would not be at high enough risk for 
breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Bretz, however, said that the study was rejected because he did not have the 
academic ties of traditional researchers. He said that he would revise his 
study proposal in an effort to satisfy the committee's demands. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed study, endorsed by American and Soviet cancer specialists in 
March, would involve administration of tamoxifen, an anti-estrogen drug already 
widely used in post-surgical breast cancer therapy, to women considered at high 
risk for breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
It would be the first large-scale study undertaken jointly in the United States 
and Soviet Union, its sponsors said. The pool of participants, about 10,000 
from each country, would consist primarily of daughters, sisters or mothers of 
women who have had breast cancer and who are considered at high risk of 
developing the disease themselves. Half of the women would be given a medically 
worthless placebo for comparison purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers had predicted a 25% reduction in the incidence of breast cancer 
among the women who were given the drug. 
</P>
<P>
The study would be coordinated by Bretz; Dr. Philip B. Dreisbach, of the 
Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, and Dr. David Zaridze, deputy 
director of the All-Union Cancer Research Institute in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The study was opposed by some women's health advocacy groups, who said it is 
dangerous to experiment with drugs on healthy women. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a drug that is not risk-free," said Cindy Pearson, program director of 
the National Women's Health Network. "It's a fine drug for a breast cancer 
patient -- a woman facing the possibility of death is more than willing to take 
a drug that has some risk. But to jump from a drug that's effective in a group 
with a life-threatening disease to a huge trial in healthy women is crazy." 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Wendy Schain, a psychologist with Memorial Cancer Institute in Long 
Beach and a former breast cancer patient, recommended approval of the study. 
"This is the best we've got," she said. "We need to get these answers. We have 
no better way to get them." 
</P>
<P>
Tamoxifen causes cancer in animals and has been linked to stroke, heart disease 
and endometrial cancer in women, according to the FDA. Sponsors of the proposed 
study, however, maintain that tamoxifen has minimal negative side effects and 
often reduces cholesterol and eases cardiovascular problems. 
</P>
<P>
FDA officials said that a large study of a drug in healthy humans was "a little 
unusual," but not unprecedented. "Any time you do a study on a drug for 
prophylaxis (prevention), you're going to use healthy people," said Dr. Robert 
Temple, the FDA's director of new drug evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
Tamoxifen, manufactured by the British firm Imperial Chemical Industries and 
sold under the brand name Nolvadex, has been used for more than a decade to 
prevent the recurrence of tumors in women whose cancer had spread to the 
underarm lymph nodes. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the FDA approved its use in the post-surgical treatment of early 
breast cancer in women who do not have node involvement. In this country, it is 
produced and marketed by ICI Pharmaceuticals of Wilmington, Del. 
</P>
<P>
Tamoxifen works by blocking so-called estrogen receptors -- areas on the 
surface of cells to which the hormone binds to exert its effects. In that way, 
it blocks the effects of estrogen, which is believed to play a role in the 
stimulation of tumor growth in breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women in the United States 
and the second leading cause of cancer death among women, after lung cancer. An 
estimated 150,000 new cases will be diagnosed this year.

SAUSAGE SIZZLES AT CENTER OF MILWAUKEE RACIAL TENSION;

CIVIL RIGHTS: AN ACTIVIST BLACK ALDERMAN IS CENSURED IN A PRODUCT-TAMPERING

<P>
In a town where beer is champagne and bratwurst is caviar, the plump, German 
luncheon link has become embroiled in a bizarre racial dispute that is sizzling 
hotter this summer than a backyard barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council Friday voted to censure Michael McGee, a flamboyant black 
alderman who has previously threatened urban guerrilla violence against whites, 
for his part in a product tampering scare last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 80,000 pounds of bratwurst and other sausages were yanked from local 
grocery shelves after McGee claimed that he had been informed of a terrorist 
threat to inject rat poison into the products of a local sausage manufacturer, 
a company that had opposed plans to rename a downtown street after Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
No tainted meat has been found and no charges have been filed in connection 
with the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-3 censure vote, the first action of its kind in the council's 140-year 
history, came after a week of mounting tensions that virtually paralyzed city 
government, as McGee traded insults with white city officials who accused him 
of concocting the poison story to get headlines and scare people. 
</P>
<P>
Black leaders, meanwhile, rushed to McGee's defense, demanding apologies from 
his critics and charging them with ignoring the serious economic and social 
plight of minorities in Milwaukee, a community rarely thought of by outsiders 
as a caldron of black-white friction. 
</P>
<P>
At least 25% of Milwaukee's 600,000 residents are black. According to a variety 
of government and private studies, the city is considered one of the nation's 
most segregated and leads the country in such dubious categories as the 
disparity between black and white unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
The tough-talking McGee, strutting through the council chambers in black 
military-style garb and wearing on his hip a holster containing a slingshot, 
greeted Friday's council action with a mix of defiance, bluster and threats. 
</P>
<P>
"This means nothing to me whatsoever but it just confirms my statements about 
how racist this city is," he charged during debate. " . . . In the black 
community, we're opposed to violence as much as anybody (but) it seems to me 
the only thing white people understand is violence." 
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, supporters in the gallery erupted in applause. Among them were at 
least a dozen people clad like McGee in the uniform of his self-styled Black 
Panther Militia and waving signs that declared: "Milwaukee is a racist city" 
and "By any means necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Once a member of the original militant Black Panther group, McGee caused a stir 
in Milwaukee last February when he announced the formation of an updated 
version, which he warned would begin a wave of terrorist attacks in 1995 unless 
inner-city schools, job opportunities and other programs had made a dramatic 
turnaround. In interviews, he suggested his group could roll burning tires down 
freeways, lob bombs into the arena during Milwaukee Bucks basketball games and 
even take hostages. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, he has been at the forefront of a drive to rename six blocks 
known as Old World Milwaukee Street. The section is part of what once was known 
as Third Street. Several years ago, all but those few blocks, which contain a 
turn of the century tourist complex of ethnic German shops and restaurants, 
were renamed for King. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants on the street have resisted any name change, saying it would be an 
inconvenience and confuse tourists. The most prominent of the opponents is 
Usinger's, a 110-year-old family-owned sausage empire founded by German 
immigrants. The main Usinger's retail shop is on the street, but it sells its 
products in groceries throughout the metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
On June 22, McGee delivered a letter to police saying that the previous day he 
had received a phone call about poisoned sausage from a group he identified as 
the Militant African Underground Squared, or Mau-Mau. In the letter, McGee 
disavowed any involvement in the alleged sabotage. "Any type of action like 
this I would only endorse after 1995," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said they'd never heard of the group and questioned why, if the 
threat was real, McGee would wait several hours and inform the media first 
before passing the warning on to police. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor John O. Norquist defiantly stuffed an Usinger's sausage into his mouth 
during a press conference in which he denounced McGee as a "demented" publicity 
seeker out to fan racial hatred rather than help the underprivileged. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the company ordered a precautionary recall of its package 
products from 150 area stores. Though he declined to give a specific number, 
company spokesman Evan Zeppos said the costs of the recall would be 
"substantial" both to Usinger's and the public. 
</P>
<P>
"We're at the height of the barbecue season here," he said. "People in 
Milwaukee take their sausage very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
However unnerving his manner, McGee's tactics raise serious questions about the 
continuing gap, not just in lifestyles, but also in perceptions of blacks and 
whites. Critics attack McGee as irresponsible and divisive. Sympathizers, on 
the other hand, say it sometimes takes extreme pressure to get whites to take 
notice of black problems. "This is a very segregated city and we're tired of 
being ignored," explained Elizabeth Coggs-Jones, a member of the Milwaukee 
County Board of Supervisors and who is black. 
</P>
<P>
But Alderman Thomas Nardelli, a white who voted for the censure action, said 
McGee's antics only diverted attention from the causes he claimed to espouse.

When Andrea Gurka saw the wall of flames racing up Old San Marcos Pass Road 
Wednesday evening, quickly approaching her home, she placed a frantic phone 
call to her husband at work. She was stuck without a car and didn't know what 
to do. 
</P>
<P>
That's the last anyone heard from Gurka. The 37-year-old woman fled her home on 
foot, apparently trying to outrun the violent blaze that would consume her home 
and hundreds of others along the winding mountain canyon, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Gurka made it to the the dry creek bed that runs behind her home, but no 
farther. A search-and-rescue team found her body there Friday morning, after 
her husband reported her missing. 
</P>
<P>
For all the massive destruction wrought by fire across Southern California this 
week, there have been only two deaths. The other came Thursday in Riverside 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Ferrera, 23, of San Diego, an inmate from a Department of Corrections 
camp, was among a 17-member crew overrun by flames Wednesday afternoon near 
Hemet when a whirling wind suddenly shifted the brush fire they were fighting. 
Ferrera died of his injuries the next day. 
</P>
<P>
The young man, one of seven children of a San Diego metal worker and his wife, 
had been in minor trouble with the law over drugs since he was a kid, a 
Department of Corrections official said. He was serving his first long-term 
sentence, at the Bautista Conservation Camp in Hemet, this time for an armed 
robbery while high on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Counselors at the camp said he was a well-behaved and "kind of quiet guy," the 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, smaller fires have frequently resulted in higher death tolls. For 
instance, the 1985 Baldwin Hills fire in Los Angeles, which destroyed 48 homes, 
killed three people. Ten people died in the 1970 fire that raged from Newhall 
to Malibu, destroying more than 400 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials attribute the low death toll in this year's fires, which 
consumed thousands of acres and more than 500 homes, to a combination of 
improved training, public education, interagency coordination -- and luck. 
</P>
<P>
"You have the best of your training and you put it into effect when emergencies 
like this come up -- sometimes you're fortunate and other times you're not," 
said Cindy Webster, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service and Santa Barbara 
County public agencies. "This time, our investment paid off and we're 
grateful." 
</P>
<P>
Training in recent years among fire-fighting agencies, including those serving 
Glendale and Santa Barbara -- two of the hardest-hit areas in this week's fires 
-- has increasingly focused on safety, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We stress safety more now than we did perhaps 10 years ago," said Capt. Al 
Kepler, a spokesman for the Glendale Fire Department. City firefighters are 
subjected to more intense and longer training, which continues even after 
firefighters are on the job, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not surprised by the low death toll, not with the training we're given," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters often are shown pictures and videotapes of fires where something 
went wrong and tragedy resulted, Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
"The training is very realistic, even grim," she said. "We see the mistakes 
that people have made that have gotten them killed, and we learn from them." 
</P>
<P>
Webster added that interagency emergency planning efforts have also helped in 
reducing the chaos that can lead to injury or death. Various agencies, 
including state forestry, county and city fire protection departments, have 
also stepped up public safety campaigns in recent years in the Santa Barbara 
area, she said. Residents have been bombarded with leaflets, radio public 
service announcements and presentations at homeowners' association meetings, 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really made a difference," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, given the severity of the wind-swept fires that destroyed entire 
neighborhoods in the Santa Barbara area, Webster said "it's amazing" that more 
people weren't killed in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
In Glendale, where a fast-moving blaze destroyed 46 homes before the fire was 
brought under control Wednesday night, officials were grateful that the fire 
began during daylight hours and that it occurred in an area with easy access to 
fire equipment and for the evacuation of residents. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential for injury is much greater in the dark and when people may be 
sleeping," said Kepler, adding: "I guess luck explains the low injury rate as 
well as anything." 
</P>
<P>
Hernandez reported from Los Angeles and Dunn from Santa Barbara.

GLENDALE BLAZE VICTIMS MEET TO AIR CONCERNS, SEEK ANSWERS

<P>
About 250 long-faced victims of the fire that destroyed 46 homes and damaged 20 
others in Glendale's San Rafael Hills gathered at a town hall meeting Friday 
night called by the city to calm their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Some had complaints about the way the fire was fought, some were angry because 
police wouldn't let them through to protect their homes and others were 
disgusted by the wave of strangers crawling over their streets in the wake of 
the blaze. Most, however, came to find out how to go about rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Glendale arson investigators culled dozens of tips from the public 
Friday but said they had come up with no new useful information in an expanding 
search for an arson suspect. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale Fire Capt. John Orr said Friday that a flood of about 50 tips and 
sightings of possibly suspicious behavior of people in five automobiles had 
only made the picture more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
At the town hall meeting, Glendale Fire Chief John Montenero came prepared to 
face anger from residents who could not get firefighters to turn hoses on their 
burning houses. 
</P>
<P>
In opening remarks, he told the crowd at the Civic Auditorium that the fire 
spread too fast for fire units from other cities to get in position to protect 
every home. 
</P>
<P>
"In the meantime, homes are burning," Montenero said. "Your homes are burning 
and they're not being attended to. And that makes you angry. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have the resources because of the magnitude of the fire." 
</P>
<P>
Montenero asked residents to work with the city to start a program for 
replacing wood roofs with fire-retardant materials and developing greenbelts 
around residential housing areas. 
</P>
<P>
"We now have learned from first-hand experience our limitations and the power 
of nature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Don Reece, a resident of Sweetbriar Drive, complained that some 
firemen didn't seem to be doing their jobs. Reece said he saw several fire 
trucks standing idle on Verdugo Road while houses on his street were burning. 
</P>
<P>
"They refused," he said. "They were sassy." 
</P>
<P>
Reece said he finally got one fireman to come to his neighbor's house with a 
hose, but the fireman then handed it over to the neighbor's son and left. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, that's criminal," Reece said. 
</P>
<P>
Montenero promised Reece that a complete retracing of every engine's movements 
during the fire would be completed and made public within a month. 
</P>
<P>
Others were unhappy about police roadblocks that kept them from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Reuben Torres, whose house on Foxkirk Drive burned to the ground, said he had 
installed sprinklers to water the brush along the banks of the Glendale 
Freeway, but they were never turned on because his wife was stopped by police 
as she tried to reach the house. 
</P>
<P>
But Torres, like many residents, seemed more unhappy about the dozens of 
contractors and insurance adjusters milling about the neighborhood, calling 
them "vultures." 
</P>
<P>
Although such complaints produced some cheers, most in the audience had 
practical questions such as whether they had to continue paying their mortgages 
and how they could get building permits. 
</P>
<P>
They listened politely as a panel of city, county, state and federal officials 
outlined building permit procedures, applications for disaster loans and 
property tax allowances. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the day Friday, an arson task force headed by Orr continued to 
search for occupants of a late 1970s blue Honda seen near the source of 
Wednesday's fire just as it started. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials initially described that car as the focus of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent eyewitness accounts placed two other cars near the Honda, Orr said. 
In addition, two more cars aroused suspicions in nearby brushy areas on Tuesday 
and Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses provided the license plate numbers for three of the five cars whose 
owners are being sought. He said the owners of two of those cars had been 
contacted by Friday afternoon and cleared of any connection to the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Arson is suspected because firefighters found an altered butane lighter in the 
area where the fire began on Verdugo Road. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Glendale Fire Department spokesman Chris Gray said investigators 
were seeking two men, age 20 to 25, who were seen in the blue Honda. 
</P>
<P>
"The possibility is the blue car is a witness only," Orr said. "We are urging 
them to come forward to eliminate them as suspects." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AIRCRAFT USED TO FIGHT FIRES 
</P>
<P>
S-2 Grumman Tracker: Drops phoscheck fire retardant or water as a salvo to 
douse hot spots or create a control line over which the fire cannot jump. 
</P>
<P>
Helicopters: Used to spot fires and drop water from "bambi bucket," a canvas 
container with a remote controlled opening at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the fire fighting ground crews, airplanes and helicopters re 
deployed to fight the flames from above. 
</P>
<P>
The airplanes have been modified to hold 8 to 12 250 gallon fire 
retardant/water containers. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Phoscheck is a fire retardant chemical that is added to the water loads of 
firefighting aircraft. It gives a slimy consistency and turns it bright orange. 
The chemical, which has fertilizer base, is not harmful to plants or animals. 
But it enhances the fire quenching properties of water by making it heavier and 
enabling it to smother as well as douse and cool embers. The orange dye is 
added so that airborne firefighters can see where they have dumped it.

EMERGENCY DECLARATIONS MAY TRIGGER FEDERAL HELP

Gov. George Deukmejian declared a state of emergency Friday in San Bernardino 
and Riverside counties, triggering a variety of state assistance ranging from 
tax relief to low-interest loans for those who suffered damage and loss in 
fires that have ravaged Southern California this week. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond what the state can offer, the declarations pave the way for President 
Bush to declare stricken regions as national disaster areas and pour in federal 
resources to help affected residents, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The governor on Thursday had issued emergency proclamations for Santa Barbara 
and Glendale disaster areas. 
</P>
<P>
"The main reason we wanted the declaration is so that the president can declare 
a federal disaster area as soon as possible," said John Passerello, assistant 
director of the state Office of Emergency Services. "We can't get federal funds 
for rebuilding and temporary housing until the President does that." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has written to the President requesting the federal declaration and 
the White House is expected to reach a decision today or Sunday, Passerello 
said. An emergency aid center staffed by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, the Internal Revenue Service and other agencies is set to begin 
operating at 8 a.m. today in Goleta. 
</P>
<P>
The governor's declaration also allows him to tap the state's reserve set up 
for economic uncertainties to help the areas hardest hit by the fires. 
Deukmejian has insisted on maintaining a billion-dollar reserve in the state 
budget, of which up to $40 million can be used for disasters. 
</P>
<P>
However, only $19 million remains in the disaster fund and it is unclear 
whether it will be replenished, according to the Department of Finance. The 
state fiscal year ends Saturday, and lawmakers have not yet passed a new budget 
for the 1990-91 fiscal year. Some legislators oppose Deukmejian's request that 
they approve another billion-dollar reserve for next year. 
</P>
<P>
State officials say no state emergency money has been required yet in Santa 
Barbara or Glendale. But they added that the funds may soon be needed, because 
the local governments fighting the blaze may soon turn to the state for help. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other impacts of Deukmejian's emergency declaration: 
</P>
<P>
The state's mutual aid system, which requires local firefighters from other 
parts of the state to help combat the blaze, has been activated. This was 
already starting to happen before the governor's declaration, but his move 
ensures that the state's full firefighting resources can be deployed. 
</P>
<P>
The state will provide property tax relief for damaged or destroyed private 
property. Homeowners will be able to rebuild their residences and still be 
taxed at the old property tax rate. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of other assistance such as insurance, the state will provide 
low-interest loans to help rebuild homes damaged or destroyed in the blaze.

Danger was in the air. Desperation was on the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
"Creative Care Pre-School and Amigos Day Care are evacuating," listeners to 
Santa Barbara radio station KTMS-AM learned as the 4,000-acre brush fire 
continued to rage at the edge of the city. "Parents, please come pick up your 
children." 
</P>
<P>
For a 30-hour period that ended Friday, the station tossed out its commercials 
and regular programming and transformed itself into an on-the-air bulletin 
board for emergency pleas. 
</P>
<P>
Some were the official kind issued by authorities and the firefighters' command 
post. Others weren't. 
</P>
<P>
"Would anybody near the little house behind the white picket fence on San 
Marcos Road please bring out the animals? A parakeet is in the back room . . . 
a goat is in the yard. The gate code is 22088," pleaded one message. 
</P>
<P>
"The La Cumbre Mutual Water Co. area between Puente to 154, the Hope Ranch 
Annex and Hope Ranch -- because of the loss of electricity, they are on 
emergency water use only. They are asking that no one use washing machines, 
showers or dishwashers," said another. 
</P>
<P>
Such messages kept listeners throughout the city glued to their radios. 
Residents stopped at roadblocks set up around the fire's perimeter listened 
intently in their cars. Merchants and office workers hovered near radios 
normally tuned to background music. 
</P>
<P>
At the Cathedral Oaks Lodge, front desk clerk Debbie Michael listened sadly as 
an urgent request was aired: "The Goleta Valley Hospital asks that the employer 
of Joe Foster contact them. He is believed to be a shipping clerk. He has been 
burned and they need to know about his insurance coverage for a special bed." 
</P>
<P>
On Stearns Wharf, souvenir shop worker Debbie Johnson paused to listen between 
sales of postcards and tourist knickknacks to pier visitors. "A little while 
ago I heard them say that two parents are missing their child," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
KTMS program manager Rick Bailey said hundreds of callers left messages either 
pleading for help or offering it. Dozens volunteered use of pickup trucks to 
help evacuees. Scores offered free rooms to those whose homes were destroyed. 
Others offered to take in pets. 
</P>
<P>
"Sandy Hoag on Mesa has room for a dog that's friendly and for six or more 
small birds," said the announcer. 
</P>
<P>
Hours before an official disaster list was released, announcer Robert Banks 
drove through the fire zone to check hard-hit neighborhoods that remained 
closed off to residents. 
</P>
<P>
"I took addresses of destroyed houses off mailboxes," he said. "When I got 
back, I talked with people who called about their streets. A lady asked about 
Modoc Street. She gave me her address and I told her I was sorry, but her whole 
block was leveled. She started crying. I apologized for being the one to tell 
her." 
</P>
<P>
As the fire burned into its second day, announcer Brian Green and ad salesman 
Tom Crockett took turns reading messages that were turning increasingly more 
personal. 
</P>
<P>
"Annie Hogue, your family is looking for you. Bart Bramwell, call Diana Lomas. 
Judy Jennings call Sherry or Kit," Green read.

CRANSTON REMAINS A MAJOR PLAYER; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: DESPITE SENATE ETHICS INVESTIGATION, MANY OF HIS COLLEAGUES GO ALL 
OUT TO SHOW THEY RESPECT HIS LEADERSHIP. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
On the Senate floor last Tuesday, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) held up a 
dog-eared, hen-scratched tally sheet that had been compiled by the Senate 
Democratic whip, Alan Cranston of California. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he did the country a great service today," Biden said of the angular, 
beaming senator, who was standing next to him. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston had just spearheaded the surprisingly decisive defeat of a 
constitutional amendment against flag burning. His tally sheet, denoting 
senators that he believed were lined up to oppose the amendment, precisely 
matched the eventual roll call vote. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, Cranston shepherded to Senate passage the first overhaul of 
federal housing programs in a decade, a $17.8-billion compromise bill worked 
out with Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp and key senators 
from both parties. 
</P>
<P>
And on Friday, Cranston, a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, left on a 10-day trip to India and Pakistan to assess rising 
political tensions at the invitation of both of the rival governments. 
</P>
<P>
The week's events demonstrated that, although an ethics investigation shadows 
him, the 76-year-old Californian remains an active force on the legislative 
front lines. While there are reports that some senators are keeping their 
distance as Cranston records low voter-support ratings back home, there is 
evidence that he retains the respect and friendship of many colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
After the flag amendment vote, Biden, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N. Y.) paid him tributes that were 
effusive even by Senate-club standards. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston "proved once again that he is the most effective and accurate vote 
counter in the Senate," Mitchell said. "He certainly was invaluable to me in 
organizing the effort to defeat the amendment." 
</P>
<P>
"He knows how much we love him and admire him," Moynihan added, offering both 
kudos and a gesture of sympathy. Cranston faces a Senate Ethics Committee 
decision in the next two or three months. 
</P>
<P>
The panel is seeking to determine whether Cranston and four colleagues 
intervened improperly with federal regulators on behalf of Lincoln Savings 
&amp; Loan while receiving large political donations from Charles H. Keating 
Jr., owner of the Irvine, Calif.-based thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston and the other senators -- Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), John McCain 
(R-Ariz.), John Glenn (D-Ohio) and Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) -- have 
denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there has been any real negative impact" from the inquiry, 
Cranston said in an interview Friday before departing on his trip. "The reason 
is that every senator who has ever lifted a finger for anybody who contributed 
to his campaign or paid him a speech honorarium is very concerned about the 
sort of case that Common Cause tries to make out of all this." 
</P>
<P>
Common Cause, the citizens lobby group, filed a complaint before the Ethics 
Committee suggesting that favors had been done for Keating in exchange for 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston said that he is "going full tilt" on a number of issues on which he is 
a major player. These include the proposed cancellation of the B-2 Stealth 
bomber, preservation of California deserts, simplified voter registration, 
revision of campaign finance laws and application of defense budget savings to 
environmental and social programs. 
</P>
<P>
"No senator has shown any desire to keep any distance," Cranston insisted, 
despite a renewed campaign by Sen. Wendell H. Ford (D-Ky.) to unseat him as 
whip next January -- and despite leadership assignments that Mitchell has given 
to junior Sen. Wyche Fowler Jr. (D-Ga.) instead of to Cranston. 
</P>
<P>
"I am working very closely with Democrats and Republicans on a variety of 
issues, as demonstrated by the housing bill that was passed by 96 to 1," said 
Cranston, chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs 
subcommittee on housing and urban affairs. "It is really a monumental bill." 
</P>
<P>
The bill, which must be reconciled with a more costly House version, authorizes 
an increase of about $12 billion for housing programs over the next three 
years. A key Democratic program called Housing Opportunity Partnerships would 
consolidate several small existing programs and provide subsidies to encourage 
state, local and private investment in an expansion of "affordable housing," 
starting with $2 billion next year.

Two suburban men said Friday they were so drunk on a recent night out that they 
couldn't find their parked car and decided, for no reason, to beat up a 
pedestrian: Rep. Gerry E. Studds (D-Mass.). 
</P>
<P>
James L. Byrne and Thomas E. Carter Jr., both 19, pleaded guilty in U.S. 
District Court to a misdemeanor charge of assault on a member of Congress 
stemming from the June 7 beating. The attack took place shortly after midnight 
as Studds was walking home alone from a dinner party at a friend's house. 
</P>
<P>
"We were pretty intoxicated. We were looking for the car. I guess we were 
pretty frustrated," Carter told Magistrate Patrick Attridge. "I took the first 
swing. Jimmy (Byrne) followed after that." 
</P>
<P>
Studds was punched in the face, knocked to the ground and kicked, according to 
prosecutors and witnesses. He suffered bruises and lacerations to the face and 
body but was not hospitalized.

POLITICS: PARTY LEADERS GATHER AS THE DUAL ASSAULT ON BUSH AND THE GOP IS 
UNVEILED. SOME WORRY THAT THE TOUGH NEW STRATEGY MAY GO TOO FAR.

Democratic Party leaders, gathered here this weekend from around the country, 
are planning a double-barreled offensive against President Bush for reneging on 
his no-new-taxes campaign promise and on the GOP for its handling of the 
savings and loan scandal. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to take off the gloves," national chairman Ron Brown told the 
opening session of the summer conference of the Assn. of State Democratic 
Chairs here Friday, only a few hours after Bush tried to defend his switch on 
taxes in a nationally televised press conference. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee research staff put the finishing 
touches on a strategy memorandum for distribution to the state party officials 
and Democratic candidates. A draft version made available to the press urges 
Democrats to emphasize that the Bush Administration "is failing to make the 
S&amp;L crooks pay," that the Administration's bailout plan is unfair and that 
Democrats offer their own plan "to make sure that these problems will never 
happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Party strategists see the linkage of the tax hike and savings and loan issues 
as made to order for them this campaign year as they strive to maintain their 
control of Congress and most of the nation's statehouses. 
</P>
<P>
The combination allows them to challenge the Republicans on what is supposed to 
be their strongest ground -- stewardship of the nation's economy. "The issue 
here is fiscal mismanagement," said Ohio chairman Jim Ruvolo, president of the 
state chairs association. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the dual controversies also help the Democrats to emphasize 
the sort of bread-and-butter concerns and populist rhetoric which have 
traditionally been their stock in trade. "I think just saying we ought to put 
these crooks in jail is a good issue for Democrats," Bob Slagle, Texas party 
chairman, said of the savings and loan issue. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the Democrats face some obstacles in implementing this strategic 
blueprint. On the tax issue, party leaders acknowledge the need for a measure 
of restraint because they are still trying to live down their own reputation as 
the party of tax hikes, which hurt them so seriously during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"Some Democratic governors have had to ask for tax increases, too," Ruvolo 
pointed out in suggesting that Democrats need to seem constructive in 
responding to Bush's fiscal change of heart. "If we can appear more fiscally 
responsible, that's what the American people want," Ruvolo said. "The party 
that doesn't appear fiscally responsible is the one that is going to get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Democrats maintain that Bush's willingness to consider a tax increase 
would shield their state and local officeholders who have backed tax increases 
from attacks by Republican challengers. 
</P>
<P>
The savings and loan issue also poses problems for Democrats because some of 
their prominent officeholders have been embroiled in that controversy in one 
way or another. Ties to the thrift industry made former House Speaker Jim 
Wright of Texas and former House Majority Whip Tony Coelho of California 
vulnerable to charges of unethical behavior which led to their resignations 
from Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, four Democratic senators, Alan Cranston of California, Dennis 
DeConcini of Arizona, John Glenn of Ohio and Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, 
have come under fire because of their links to controversial savings and loan 
operator Charles H. Keating. 
</P>
<P>
The criticism of the Democratic connection to the scandal has been extensive 
enough that Paul Goldman, Virginia state party chairman, objects to a 
resolution submitted by national chairman Brown to the executive committee of 
the national party, putting the blame for the scandal solely on the faulty 
supervision and the economic philosophy of "two successive Republican 
administrations." 
</P>
<P>
"The Democrats make a terrible mistake by saying it's totally the Republicans 
fault," he said of the resolution which the executive committee is expected to 
approve at its meeting here today. "The media knows that's not true and so does 
the public, and we'll lose our credibility," he added. Goldman advocates 
creating a nonpartisan commission to investigate the root causes of the scandal 
and calculate its ultimate cost. 
</P>
<P>
But Brown shrugged off this criticism. "Of course the Democrats bear some 
responsibility," he said. "But if you measure who is really responsible and on 
whose watch it has occurred, it was this Administration which is responsible 
for enforcing the laws of this country." 
</P>
<P>
Driving home the populist thrust of the Democratic attack, in a speech prepared 
for delivery to today's executive committee meeting, Brown argues that Bush 
refused to call for a tax increase to raise funds for a range of domestic needs 
such as helping the homeless, increasing federal aid to education, bolstering 
the nation's infrastructure or cleaning up the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"This summer, though, we have found the one cause for which George Bush is 
willing to break his 'no-new-taxes' pledge," Brown said, "the bankers and 
speculators who ran the savings and loan industry into the ground."

President Bush said Friday that he has a lot in common with Abraham Lincoln -- 
but there are some important differences, as well. 
</P>
<P>
When asked at a press conference how he could justify having reversed his 
pledge of "no new taxes," Bush shot back: "I'm doing like Lincoln did -- 'think 
anew.' 
</P>
<P>
" 
</P>
<P>
His reference was to a passage from the Great Emancipator's second annual 
message to Congress in 1862: "The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and 
we must rise with the occasion," Lincoln said. "As our case is new, so we must 
think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save 
our country." 
</P>
<P>
Like Lincoln, Bush has been plagued with an ever-growing federal budget 
deficit. In the Lincoln era, the government's red ink rose from $25 million in 
fiscal 1861 to $964 million in fiscal 1865. During the years that Bush has been 
either vice president or President, the deficit has soared -- from $78.9 
billion in fiscal 1981 to $152.1 billion in fiscal 1989. And it is climbing 
again. 
</P>
<P>
But there are also some differences: Lincoln's mushrooming deficit stemmed from 
expenses incurred in fighting the Civil War, while Bush is enjoying 
unprecedented peace worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
And "Honest Abe" never pledged that he would not raise taxes.

GREAT WESTERN DEAL FOR FLORIDA S&amp;L IS BIGGEST U.S. BAILOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Great Western Financial agreed Friday to buy CenTrust Federal Savings Bank in 
Florida in the biggest taxpayer bailout yet of a savings and loan. The deal 
marks the end of a thrift that came to symbolize some of the worst examples of 
greed and gluttony in the nation's thrift debacle. 
</P>
<P>
Taxpayers will pick up a bill of about $1.7 billion for CenTrust. Great 
Western, the Beverly Hills parent of Great Western Bank, will pay $86.4 million 
for CenTrust's 71 branches and $5.2 billion in deposits. The deal makes Great 
Western Florida's biggest thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Former CenTrust Chairman David L. Paul was one of the biggest of the big 
spenders among savings and loan executives. Last Saturday, auctioneers in Miami 
sold about 16,000 items Paul bought with CenTrust's taxpayer-insured deposits, 
including 1,440 Baccarat goblets, crystal toothpick holders, a cigar humidor 
and a 12-place setting of Limoges china. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the government disclosed that the cost to bail out what had been 
Gibraltar Savings was a surprisingly high $628 million, $522 million of that 
for Gibraltar's California operation based in Simi Valley. Private estimates 
had totaled about $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
Security Pacific Corp. beat out Great Western earlier this week to buy the 
Gibraltar operations, paying $141 million plus an additional $3 million for an 
option to buy up to $1 billion in assets. Security Pacific receives 83 
Gibraltar branches in California, six branches in Washington state, $5 billion 
in deposits and $1.7 billion in home loans. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's actions on CenTrust and 14 other thrifts put the government over the 
top in meeting its goal of selling or closing 141 failed thrifts by today. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the government said it actually disposed in that time of 155 thrifts -- 
17 of them in California -- through sale or liquidation at a cost to taxpayers 
of $29 billion, as part of what was called "Operation Clean Sweep." The goal 
was set in March by L. William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., 
amid criticism by Congress and others that the thrift mop-up agency was moving 
too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
Government thrift officials were obviously pleased that they met Seidman's 
target, which some skeptics doubted they could reach. "Operation Clean Sweep 
has brought greater stability to the nation's financial system," Seidman said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the government's three-month spree was made possible largely because it 
sold only branches, deposits and low-risk home loans while stripping away the 
bad assets such as risky junk bonds and empty office buildings that led to the 
demise of the thrifts in the first place. In the case of CenTrust, the 
government is still stuck with $3.1 billion in junk bonds, loans and various 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
Although selling the thrifts reduces the government's operating costs, selling 
those bad assets is critical to cutting the rising costs of the government's 
S&amp;L bailout, estimated to run $500 billion over the next 30 to 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Although the biggest single bailout to date, the CenTrust failure may be 
eclipsed by the collapse of Charles H. Keating Jr.'s Lincoln Savings and Loan 
Assn. in Irvine. The Lincoln case is expected to cost taxpayers about $2 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Although Great Western is paying $86.4 million for CenTrust, the deal actually 
will cost the firm about $61 million. That's because Great Western is taking 
over $3.3 billion in CenTrust home loans, consumer loans and securities and 
turning them over for $25 million to Merrill Lynch Capital Markets to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Great Western receives $5.2 billion in deposits. But only $1.78 billion of 
those deposits are so-called core deposits, which represent deposits from more 
loyal customers who are likely to stay with the institution. Paul funded 
CenTrust largely with deposits from Wall Street money brokers who shift their 
money around to institutions offering the highest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Great Western agreed last July to buy 63 CenTrust branches for about $100 
million, but the deal fell through after regulators seized it. On a comparable 
basis, the government could have reaped about $40 million more had it let the 
Great Western deal stand. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate deal, Great Western is acquiring 18 branches with $700 million in 
deposits for $3.75 million that had been part of Gibraltar's Florida operation. 
Overall, Great Western now has 154 retail branch offices in Florida and 
deposits totaling $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Four other California thrifts have operations in Florida: GlenFed in Glendale, 
H. F. Ahmanson in Los Angeles, First Nationwide in San Francisco and CalFed in 
Los Angeles.

7 SOUTHLAND S&amp;LS ON PRIORITY LIST FOR FBI INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal thrift regulators and the FBI have given top priority to investigations 
of seven failed Orange County and Los Angeles savings and loans as part of the 
Bush Administration's new coordinated effort to push for criminal prosecutions 
in thrift fraud cases. 
</P>
<P>
A surprise among the seven targeted S&amp;Ls is Mercury Savings &amp; Loan in 
Huntington Beach, where there was no previous hint of a criminal probe. 
Regulators seized the insolvent S&amp;L on Feb. 23, ousting its officers and 
chairman, long-time industry leader Leonard Shane. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence G. Lawler, special agent in charge of the FBI district in Los Angeles, 
said Mercury and the other S&amp;Ls have been singled out for special scrutiny 
by the Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates the nation's S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
He said that, while the OTS does not set his priorities, his office had already 
determined that its biggest thrift fraud cases involved the same seven 
institutions, including one of the nation's most notorious collapses, that of 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Lawler identified the other top priorities as First Network Savings Bank, 
Westwood Savings &amp; Loan and Brookside Savings &amp; Loan, all in Los 
Angeles, and two defunct thrifts, American Diversified Savings Bank in Costa 
Mesa and Consolidated Savings Bank in Irvine. All but Brookside and Westwood 
have been reported previously as under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Those cases are the reason we can't get to the other investigations," Lawler 
said about a backlog of 286 requests to probe financial institution fraud. 
</P>
<P>
The seven institutions are among 29 failed thrifts and six failed banks that 
Lawler's office is investigating currently. 
</P>
<P>
Lawler said the OTS information was given to him last week when he was in 
Washington for a news conference at which President Bush outlined his 
stepped-up strategy to put "the cheats and the chiselers and the charlatans" of 
the savings and loan industry behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
The OTS would not identify its priority cases. But T. Timothy Ryan Jr., 
director of OTS, said he has turned over to the Justice Department a list of 
100 thrifts that regulators want the FBI to view as priority investigations. 
Regulators consider 20 of those cases to be top priority, he said. The seven 
local thrifts are among them. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan is heading the Administration's effort to focus Justice on major cases and 
to raise the public's awareness of the thrift fraud problem. Bush created a new 
Justice Department post to handle financial institution fraud and asked 
Congress to authorize $25 million more for extra federal agents to investigate 
and prosecute financial fraud. 
</P>
<P>
Lawler, whose FBI district covers seven counties stretching from Orange County 
to San Luis Obispo County, declined to provide details of the investigations of 
the thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI usually discloses only that bank fraud and embezzlement investigations 
are pending at specific institutions. In some cases, the agency will not even 
acknowledge that an investigation is being conducted. Earlier this week, for 
instance, it still refused to confirm that it was probing Lincoln Savings. 
</P>
<P>
The addition of Mercury to the top-priority list surprised industry observers, 
including William D. Davis, the commissioner of the state Department of Savings 
and Loan. Davis said he had no inkling of any possible criminal wrongdoing at 
the S&amp;L. 
</P>
<P>
Shane, Mercury's former chairman, has been one of the industry's most 
persuasive and compelling spokesmen and a campaigner for the traditional thrift 
role of home lending. Through much of the last decade, he has been both adviser 
to and supporter of regulators, though the relationship has soured in the last 
two years. And he has been vocal in his call to rid the industry of crooks and 
others who recklessly invested insured deposits in risky ventures. 
</P>
<P>
Shane said Friday that he was not aware of an investigation of Mercury and had 
no idea what it was about. "I can't imagine why, unless it was our complaints 
they're investigating," he said. He would not elaborate on the complaints, but 
they are believed to involve several former executives in a loan-kickback 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Mercury has been touched by scandal twice before. The thrift lost $17 million 
in the early and mid-1980s when a former executive and a contractor engaged in 
a loan-kickback scheme in Northern California and when a Southern California 
builder used fraudulent documentation to obtain loans. The losses were written 
off in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Accounting errors and two defaulted hotel loans eventually sank the thrift in 
red ink. It lost $53.6 million in 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The takeover of Lincoln in April, 1989, and its aftermath, including a House 
Banking Committee hearing into the collapse, has been well documented. More 
than two dozen major civil lawsuits have been filed against the former 
operators and others, and regulators have filed a racketeering suit against 
them. 
</P>
<P>
American Diversified and Consolidated, both seized in 1986, were involved in a 
number of deals together, including the sale of vacant Carson land that was 
once a hazardous waste site. Consolidated was closed a few months after it was 
seized. Regulators closed American Diversified in June, 1987, refunding a 
record $1.14 billion to depositors. 
</P>
<P>
First Network, seized April 20, was headed by Carl M. Rheuban, an amateur 
magician, philanthropist and developer who had close ties to Democratic 
politicians. Rheuban was a major contributor to political campaigns, including 
those of Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) and Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.). 
</P>
<P>
Westwood and Brookside were seized last year.

TIME WARNER SUIT THREATENS MGM/UA DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: PATHE COMMUNICATIONS IS ACCUSED OF VIOLATING ITS AGREEMENT WITH 
THE NEW YORK MEDIA GIANT OVER THE ACQUISITION OF THE STUDIO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CIEPLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Time Warner Inc. filed a $100-million lawsuit against Pathe Communications 
Corp. late Friday in a move that threatens to block any bid by Pathe to 
complete its proposed $1.3-billion acquisition of MGM/UA Communications Co. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, accuses Pathe of violating an 
agreement under which Time Warner was to provide $650 million in financing for 
the MGM/UA purchase. 
</P>
<P>
The suit also claims that Pathe is using a revised merger bid, which was 
announced last week, as "a smokescreen" to obscure its inability or 
unwillingness to honor its agreement with Time Warner. 
</P>
<P>
A Pathe spokesman said he hadn't seen the suit and declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Time Warner's insistence that Pathe honor the companies' financing agreement 
appeared to jeopardize any effort by Pathe to find alternative financing for 
its new $21.50-a-share bid. Under an agreement with MGM/UA majority shareholder 
Kirk Kerkorian, Pathe is to prepay $4 a share to MGM/UA stockholders, while it 
seeks financing to pay the $17.50-a-share balance by October 23. 
</P>
<P>
Under its agreement with Pathe, Time Warner was to receive long-term 
distribution rights to MGM/UA and Pathe films in return for its $650 million in 
loan guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
In the suit, Time Warner said Pathe "acted as if the contract gave Pathe a 
one-way option to decide which of its obligations it would honor, which Time 
Warner rights it could ignore, and which conditions it would satisfy." The 
company also accused Pathe of double-selling video rights to its own films both 
to Warner Home Video and to MGM/UA's home video arm. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals close to Warner said a key problem was Pathe's inability to provide 
$600 million in equity and film production funds to match Time Warner's 
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason for that requirement was so that this deal would not be done 
shabbily," one individual close to Warner said of the requirement. "This 
(merger) was not to result in a highly leveraged company. It was to protect the 
shareholders of MGM/UA, of Pathe and of Time Warner. More importantly, it was 
to protect the filmmaking community. Those groups of people would have been 
hurt if the company failed and was dismantled." 
</P>
<P>
Pathe had asked Time Warner to accept a patchwork of $370 million in loans, 
advances and other funds in fulfillment of its funding requirement. The lawsuit 
said Pathe had failed "to obtain even minimally acceptable legal opinions and a 
satisfactory solvency opinion." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Kirkorian nor MGM/UA was named as a defendant in the suit, and MGM/UA 
Chairman Jeffrey Barbakow declined to comment on it. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Time Warner associates said a key concern of the company in filing 
suit was "to make sure the assets" of MGM/UA weren't sold or committed to 
others in violation of Time Warner's financing agreement. 
</P>
<P>
In its suit, Warner claimed the right to distribute forthcoming Pathe films, 
including "Quigley Down Under" with Tom Selleck and "Russia House" with 
Michelle Pfeiffer and Sean Connery, even though MGM/UA executives have 
privately said the companies were going ahead with plans to distribute the 
movies through MGM/UA. 
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuit, Pathe's April 9 agreement with Time Warner required 
it to come up not only with $600 million in acquisition funds that included no 
borrowings, but an additional $200 million in production loans. "They have no 
production funding," an individual close to Time Warner said of Pathe on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit also claimed that Pathe Co-President Giancarlo Parretti misled 
Warner Bros. President Terry Semel into believing that a group of Pathe films 
was available for distribution by Warner's video division when in fact the 
films had already been committed to MGM/UA. 
</P>
<P>
In a further claim, the suit accuses Pathe of "starting a deceptive public 
relations campaign of falsely blaming Time Warner (for failure to complete the 
MGM/UA bid) and thereby trying to mask its own inability and refusal" to live 
up to its agreements. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asks for at least $100 million in damages and for punitive damages of 
an unspecified amount.

EQUITEC GROUP NEAR DEAL TO TRANSFER PROPERTIES; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: HALLWOOD GROUP MAY TAKE OVER 27 CHOICE ASSETS OF THE OAKLAND 
FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANY, SOURCES SAY. 
</P>

<P>
Equitec Financial Group, a troubled financial services and asset management 
company based in Oakland, is getting ready to turn over 27 of its choice real 
estate properties to Hallwood Group Inc., according to Wall Street sources. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the transaction -- which is expected to be announced early next week 
-- some 80,000 investors who own pieces of Equitec's limited partnerships will 
receive shares of a new master limited partnership that is being formed. The 
new partnership units will trade on the American Stock Exchange, according to 
the sources, who added that the price of the units has not yet been determined. 
</P>
<P>
"This deal gives Equitec investors an opportunity to survive and thrive, 
instead of facing oblivion," says a source close to the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Equitec will receive slightly more than $5 million from Hallwood for its 1% 
interest in the partnerships. Hallwood will also replace Equitec as the general 
partner of the properties. The 27 properties are located in Anaheim, Atlanta, 
Baltimore, Bethesda, Md., Chicago, Sacramento, San Diego, St. Louis and St. 
Paul, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
Thirteen of the properties are office buildings, seven are industrial parks and 
seven are retail outlets. As part of the deal, Hallwood will relinquish 
ownership of about 11 of Equitec's less attractive properties. 
</P>
<P>
A source says Hallwood, an international merchant banking company in New York 
that specializes in corporate rescues, believes that it has cleaned up the real 
estate portfolios of the Equitec partnerships so that the properties will have 
a positive cash flow. Hallwood feels its action will permit it to pay the 
limited partners a dividend starting the first year under new management. 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the day, people should have buildings that go up in value," says 
a source. Equitec is endorsing the transaction, but at least 50% of the limited 
partners must approve the transaction before it can be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
Hallwood's stock is selling for about 47 cents a share on the New York Stock 
Exchange, having traded as high as $3.125 in the past 52 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, Hallwood announced that it would try to intervene in a bailout of 
Equitec, but no details have been announced since then. 
</P>
<P>
Hallwood fancies itself as a "white knight" for troubled companies. It showed 
off its skills with Integra, a hotel and restaurant company that was formerly 
known as Brock Hotels. It also arranged a spinoff of ShowBiz Pizza Time Inc. 
from Brock, and it owns 15% of Heck's, a West Virginia-based retailer that it 
helped rescue. 
</P>
<P>
Sources say Hallwood will attempt to use the Equitec situation as a springboard 
for other deals involving real estate partnerships. "If this works, Hallwood 
sees it as a model that it can use in other distressed situations," one source 
said. "This is an outside party coming in on a rescue basis. It's not the same 
guys who messed up in the first place" trying to rescue the company. 
Pacificorp, the utility holding company based in Portland, Ore., owns about 49% 
of Equitec's stock.

The International Monetary Fund will raise the interest it charges on its loans 
to 9.65% from 9.30%, a fund official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The hike, which will apply to about $30 billion in outstanding loans, will 
become effective July 1. It aims at providing the fund with additional 
resources to bail out countries with overdue loan repayments. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a "burden-sharing" arrangement between the industrial nations and 
the developing countries reached in April, the rate of interest the IMF pays to 
countries that lend it money will be reduced, to approximately 7.3%.

Consumers Less Confident: Consumer confidence declined significantly in June, 
the Conference Board reported. 
</P>
<P>
The group said its consumer confidence index for June stood at 102.5, down 
almost five points from May. The year 1985 represents 100 in the index, which 
is based on survey responses. "The drop in confidence primarily reflects 
increasing concern about jobs," a spokesman said of the business group's 
monthly survey.

IRVINE FIRM SAYS ITS SHUTTLE VALVE HAS TESTED OK SO FAR 
</P>

<P>
A Parker Bertea Aerospace official said Friday that tests into the cause of 
hydrogen fuel-line leaks in NASA space shuttles have not found that key parts 
supplied by the Irvine firm were responsible for the problem. 
</P>
<P>
D. E. Logan, a spokesman for parent firm Parker Hannifin Corp. in Cleveland, 
said late Friday night that "tests to date have not shown any problems with the 
parts." The tests, he said, are continuing. 
</P>
<P>
Parker Bertea, which manufactures a wide variety of aerospace parts for 
commercial and military customers, makes 14 different subsystems for the space 
shuttle program. Those components include a 17-inch "disconnect valve" that 
links the shuttle's fuel tank to the orbiter. 
</P>
<P>
NASA engineers have traced a leak in the shuttle Atlantis and an earlier leak 
in the shuttle Columbia to the disconnect valve. On Friday, the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration announced that it had temporarily grounded 
its entire space shuttle fleet until it could determine the cause of the leaks 
and fix the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-inch disconnect valve is responsible for channeling rocket fuel safely 
to the ship's main engines. Two fittings, one for liquid hydrogen and the other 
for liquid oxygen, feed propellants into the shuttle's belly during launch 
while large valves in the lines are used to seal off the fuel line just before 
the tank is jettisoned in space. 
</P>
<P>
Logan said the system in question is only partly made by Parker Bertea. He said 
the company is working with the shuttle's main contractor, Rockwell 
International Corp., to check the integrity of the parts. 
</P>
<P>
Parker Bertea, which employs more than 3,000 people in Orange County, has been 
building shuttle parts for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
The company's electronic component products span both civilian and defense 
aerospace markets. Examples include actuators, or parts that control wing flaps 
on airplanes; a variety of fuel systems, and hydraulic and cooling systems. 
</P>
<P>
Parker Bertea reported sales of $703 million for its fiscal year ended June 30, 
1989, up 6.8% from $658 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Parent firm Parker Hannifin earned $124.5 million on sales of $2.5 billion in 
the year ended June 30, 1989.

Kent Colton doesn't usually go around hurting people, especially cops, but 
Friday he couldn't help himself. 
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old U.S. marshal from Orange County chipped a bone in one 
policeman's elbow and sent another officer off for treatment of a strained 
muscle during the wrist-wrestling competition of the 24th annual California 
Police Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
Then he got a gold medal for it. 
</P>
<P>
Besides gold, silver and bronze medals, many of the 6,000 officers from all 
over the state take bruises, breaks and bumps back to their agencies after 
competing in 44 athletic events. 
</P>
<P>
"Some sports are inherently high-risk sports," said Skip LeMaster, a Sacramento 
County sheriff's deputy who helped organize the weeklong event. This year there 
have been injuries from flag football, power lifting and soccer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very, very intense competition," said LeMaster. 
</P>
<P>
Many officers bring their families along for a week's vacation during the 
games. The games drew an estimated 15,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun," said Colton. "The only other time you get a lot of police together 
is at funerals, and those are the bad times."

CLUES TO ARSONIST'S IDENTITY SOUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
INQUIRIES: THE DEVICE THAT SPARKED SANTA BARBARA BLAZE WILL BE TESTED FOR 
FINGERPRINTS. IN FULLERTON, A PSYCHIATRIC EXAM IS ORDERED FOR A TRANSIENT HELD 
IN THE CARBON CANYON FIRE.

An incendiary device used to ignite a fire in Santa Barbara that claimed one 
life and more than 500 homes has been shipped to a laboratory for fingerprint 
testing, but investigators said Friday they are not "even close" to finding the 
arsonist responsible for the most destructive Southern California blaze in at 
least three decades. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a person or a car we can focus on right now," said Thomas E. 
Buckley, a U.S. Forest Service agent participating in a 12-member interagency 
task force investigating the blaze on Santa Barbara's western edge. 
</P>
<P>
"We're basically trying to follow up all the leads, but we're not even close," 
he added. 
</P>
<P>
From San Diego to Santa Barbara, investigators were feverishly seeking 
witnesses and other clues to this week's wave of disastrous fires in which 
arson is suspected in at least nine cases. The state fire marshal's office is 
assisting local investigative efforts. 
</P>
<P>
In Fullerton, Peter Diaz Reyes, a 29-year-old transient suspected of starting a 
fire in Carbon Canyon on the Orange-San Bernardino County line, was ordered 
Friday to undergo psychiatric evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes, who was arrested Wednesday near the fire, told investigators the blaze 
broke out while he was cooking. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes appeared briefly in Municipal Court in Fullerton, where Judge Margaret R. 
Anderson continued his arraignment until Monday and appointed a psychologist to 
examine him. She set bail at $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which damaged or destroyed 14 houses and blackened more than 6,600 
acres, was "completely contained and all but out now," Orange County Fire 
Department Capt. Dan Young said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Barbara meanwhile, authorities said it would take three to 10 days to 
receive the lab results on the incendiary device found at the fire's point of 
origin at Highway 154 and Old San Marcos Pass Road. They gloomily noted that 
fingerprints would be of no use if the arsonist has no arrest record. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators declined to describe the device for fear of jeopardizing the 
criminal case. "We want to nail this guy," said Charles Johnson, spokesman for 
the county Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
If the investigation succeeds, police will seek to have the arsonist prosecuted 
for murder in the death of Andrea Gurka, 37, whose body was found in a creek 
bed behind her home on Old San Marcos Pass Road, Santa Barbara Sheriff's Sgt. 
Jan Bullard said. 
</P>
<P>
The Forest Service's Buckley said two arson investigators happened to be nearby 
when the blaze erupted Wednesday evening and were quickly able to locate the 
fire's point of origin before it could be disturbed. They were also able to jot 
down the license plates of about 20 cars in the area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rewards totaling $120,000 have been offered for information leading to an 
arrest and conviction in the Santa Barbara fire. The Personal Insurance 
Federation of California said Friday that it would match a $50,000 reward 
offered by Gov. George Deukmejian. At least another $20,000 has been raised by 
a local radio station and a crime prevention group. Anyone with a tip can call 
1-800-782-7463. 
</P>
<P>
In Glendale -- where fire destroyed at least 46 homes and damaged more than 20 
before being controlled Wednesday -- investigators said they had pursued more 
than 20 leads without success. 
</P>
<P>
Three two-member teams were checking leads and trying to find owners of several 
cars that were reported to have been in the area when the fire began on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, where investigators attributed six out of 11 fires that plagued 
the area this week to arson, matchbooks were found at two sites.

<P>
Ron and Bettyjack Waltz watched anxiously as a huge truck lugged their new 
house across railroad tracks and into the last vacant lot on Vintage Lane. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to live in a house like this," said Ron Waltz as the dilapidated 
two-story, wood-frame home inched toward its destination. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a city-sponsored effort to preserve a downtown neighborhood, older 
homes scheduled for demolition were sold cheaply to residents in exchange for a 
commitment to move and restore the structures. The city offered low-interest 
loans to residents to help pay for the process. 
</P>
<P>
This was the fifth such home on Vintage Lane; the other four have already been 
restored to mint condition. 
</P>
<P>
About 17 years ago, the city began razing its downtown in hope that the vacant 
lots would attract developers. Many older homes were lost, but a few were 
saved. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a means of preserving some of Anaheim's past," said Tom Kupfrian, 
project coordinator for the city redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really the cream of the crop," he said of homes on Vintage Lane. 
</P>
<P>
The Waltzes home was moved from nearby 206 N. Olive St. and is the last one to 
come to Vintage Lane. The house is next to a Victorian Dutch colonial home that 
their son, Ron Jr., bought and moved three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The senior Waltz raved about the huge basement the old house will sit on, as 
well as the wine cellar, fruit and vegetable storage room and gymnasium that 
will one day be there. It will take Ron Waltz and his son about a year to 
restore the 1905 Revival-style house. 
</P>
<P>
But for them, getting the house to that point is half the fun. "We're trying to 
create something here," Ron Waltz Jr. said. "That's the neat thing about it." 
</P>
<P>
A few neighbors, friends and city officials watched as the moving team slowly 
tugged the home to its new address. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so reminiscent of times past," said Jean Matkin, a friend of the Waltzes. 
"I think it gives us a sense of where we've been and where we're going."

AMERICAN CATHOLIC CHURCH DEDICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 250 parishioners are expected to attend the Sunday dedication of a 
new Catholic church in a converted commercial building. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony, said Father Peter E. Hickman, marks the first time that the Old 
Catholic Movement has situated a church in central Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The new church, St. Matthew Old Catholic Mission Church of Orange County, joins 
St. Francis of Assisi, in Laguna Beach, as the county's only two Old Catholic 
Movement churches. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been having services in a Tustin mortuary and a facility in Huntington 
Beach," Hickman said. "This is our first official building we can call our 
own." 
</P>
<P>
The Old Catholic Movement had its beginning within the Roman Catholic Church in 
the Netherlands in 1724. It then became a formal movement within Catholicism in 
1870, Hickman said. 
</P>
<P>
Hickman said the church, in contrast with Roman Catholic Church policy, 
welcomes all baptized Christians, including divorced Catholics who seek to have 
their second marriages blessed. In addition, movement priests may marry, he 
said, although other differences are more subtle. 
</P>
<P>
St. Matthew was founded in Tustin in November, 1985. Bishop Paul Raible of the 
American Catholic Church-Old Catholic, will dedicate the new church at 10 a.m. 
The church is at 2207 W. Orangewood Ave. DAVID REYES

Rainfall in Orange County is measured by the fiscal year, which ends today. So 
1989-90 will go on record with 8.65 inches of rain, making this the fourth year 
in a row to fall below the local yearly average of 12.96 inches. 
</P>
<P>
But even though temperatures have soared to record highs recently and drought 
conditions have turned Southern California into a tinderbox, this year's 
rainfall level is still above those considered the driest on record. The 
following lists the five driest and wettest years in Orange County since 1908.

<P>
The arraignment of an 18-year-old Anaheim woman charged with the murder of 
9-year-old Autumn Wallace was continued Friday, and the public defender said he 
may ask for a change of venue. 
</P>
<P>
Maria del Rosio Alfaro is charged with first-degree murder in connection with 
the June 15 slaying of Autumn, who was found stabbed to death in her home. 
Police said Alfaro was an acquaintance of the slain girl's older sister, April, 
and had visited the home on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
"She appears young and frightened by the situation," Stephen J. Biskar, deputy 
public defender, said after the hearing at Central Municipal Court in Santa 
Ana. "They're going to go for the death penalty. In a case like this, because 
of the local outcry, there may be a change of venue. But I won't know that 
until I've had the opportunity to thoroughly review the case." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said a fingerprint found inside the family's home was the key 
factor leading to Alfaro's arrest. Alfaro, also charged with burglary and 
robbery, was picked up for questioning Wednesday before being booked into the 
Orange County Jail early Thursday. She is being held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
Police also are searching for two men who were seen in front of the Wallace 
house near a gold, late-1970s-model Chevrolet Monte Carlo on the afternoon of 
Autumn's death. Biskar said he expects police to arrest the other two suspects 
within the next week. "They have enough leads," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Autumn lived with her mother and sister in an unincorporated area between 
Stanton and Anaheim. A popular student at Dr. Jonas E. Salk Elementary School, 
Autumn was apparently home alone at the time of the slaying, waiting for her 
mother to return from work. She was found face-down in a pool of blood. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators have speculated that the girl let her attackers in willingly 
because they found no sign of forced entry. Authorities declined to say whether 
Alfaro is believed to be the person who actually killed the girl, who died of a 
loss of blood from multiple stab wounds. 
</P>
<P>
The next court date is set for July 16 before Municipal Judge Robert E. Thomas.

MAN SENTENCED FOR KILLING WIFE, SISTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 30-year-old Orange man on Friday was ordered to serve time in a mental 
hospital and then spend 26 years to life in prison for killing his wife and 
sister in June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
George Gallagher, a former electronics assembler at Rockwell International 
Corp., was found guilty by Superior Court Judge Robert Fitzgerald of 
first-degree murder for stabbing to death his sister, Mary Gallagher, at her 
home in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
The judge also found Gallagher not guilty by reason of insanity in the stabbing 
death of his wife, Barbara, at the Twin Cypress Motel in Orange, where they 
resided. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence presented during Gallagher's preliminary hearing indicated that 
Gallagher stabbed his wife in the head in the presence of the couple's two 
children, who were 4 and 5 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher, who had been suffering from mental problems, took the children to 
his sister's home after the slaying. The children, according to the evidence 
presented by Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher Evans, told the sister that their 
mother was dead. 
</P>
<P>
When his sister confronted him with the information, Gallagher left, then 
returned later and stabbed her in the heart. In finding Gallagher guilty of 
first-degree murder for his sister's death, the judge ruled that he was lucid 
at the time of that slaying and had planned the stabbing. Evans had contended 
that Gallagher killed his sister to eliminate her as a possible witness against 
him in his wife's murder. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence also indicated that Gallagher had begun suffering mental problems 
during the year before the slayings. JEANNE WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;

<P>
CONDO PROJECT HIT WITH SEISMIC ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Concern about a seismic fault, the same issue that helped derail the 
controversial Hellman Ranch project in Seal Beach, has become a key issue in a 
controversial waterfront development in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute involves a 36-unit waterfront condominium planned in affluent 
Huntington Harbour. Some residents are charging that the project would be 
dangerously close to the Newport-Inglewood fault, subjecting condo residents to 
deadly peril in the event of an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed project calls for twin buildings, each with 18 units, to be built 
on land at 4123 Warner Ave. on a site currently occupied by the Huntington 
Harbour Bay Club. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pleas of residents, a divided City Council in January voted 4 to 3 
to approve the project. Although the council split on the decision because of 
environmental concerns, earthquake safety was not an issue in its original 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
But the issue will be raised at the council's Monday night meeting because the 
city staff now concedes there was an "error found in the original plotting of a 
seismic setback area" at the condo site. 
</P>
<P>
The city staff acknowledged that the plotting of the Newport-Inglewood fault as 
shown on earlier charts was wrong. That mistake produced errors in computing 
the seismic setback areas required under state law, the city staff said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed project will have to be redesigned, and part of its foundation 
will have to be cantilevered over part of the land to make it conform to state 
law governing safety in fault areas. 
</P>
<P>
The staff report came after Councilwoman Grace Winchell demanded an 
investigation when she learned there might be errors in how fault lines are 
shown on development maps. 
</P>
<P>
"My concern is for public safety in this," Winchell said. 
</P>
<P>
The city staff has warned that a "stop-work" order on the project "may expose 
the city to litigation by the developer." 
</P>
<P>
The Newport-Inglewood fault is an underground area of instability that extends 
between those two cities. Earthquake officials have said that it is among the 
potentially most dangerous faults in the state. While many older buildings 
already occupy land over, or very near, the fault, state law in recent years 
has required setbacks from active faults for any new construction. 
</P>
<P>
The condo project is proposed to be built by Coultrup Development Co., based in 
Seal Beach. The development company did not respond to requests for comments on 
the Huntington Harbour controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the condo project say they hope the new controversy will prompt 
the city to reconsider and kill the development. They note that in nearby Seal 
Beach, council concerns focused on earthquake safety during a debate that 
killed the proposed Hellman Ranch project, a $200-million residential 
development also planned over the Newport-Inglewood fault. BILL BILLITER

COMPANIES GRANTED OZONE EXEMPTIONS

<P>
The City Council this week approved its first exemptions to companies affected 
by a law barring the use of chlorofluorocarbons and similar chemicals tied to 
the destruction of the Earth's ozone layer. 
</P>
<P>
Exemptions were granted to 27 companies, including many high-tech firms that 
use the chemicals, known as CFCs and TCAs, commonly found in solvents, 
coolants, degreasers, foaming agents, inks, plastic packaging materials and 
some medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Many firms said the law would cause them financial hardship because 
alternatives either have not been invented or are being refined. 
</P>
<P>
But in the case of the Tapmatic Corp., which uses 46,000 gallons of the 
chemicals per year to manufacture a metal coolant and lubricant, products using 
alternative substances do not sell. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials said they would go out of business without being able to use 
the banned chemicals because clients would buy products elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Other companies requested exemptions allowing them more time to find 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
For Ricoh Electronics Inc., which manufactures copier components, the law led 
to safer production materials, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen of the firms qualified for exemptions because they produced less than 
55 gallons or 450 pounds of the chemicals per year. 
</P>
<P>
Two firms are exempt because they work under military contract specifications. 
Another is exempt because its products are crucial to health care. WENDY

NO MORE WARNINGS ON ILLEGAL FIREWORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the past, the Buena Park Fire Department concentrated on educating the 
public not to shoot off bottle rockets, firecrackers and other illegal 
fireworks on the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
When firefighters and police officers spotted someone lighting illegal 
fireworks, offenders typically got a warning and had their fireworks 
confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, we're going to issue no warnings and write all citations," Fire 
Marshal Donald Tully said. The policy is the culmination of an education 
campaign against illegal fireworks that began three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The first year, we gave (most) people the benefit of the doubt: 'OK, you 
didn't know it was illegal,' " Tully said. "This year, the direction will be, 
'If you don't know, too bad. You should've known.' " 
</P>
<P>
Citations will require an appearance before a judge, who has the authority to 
levy fines on people found guilty of using illegal fireworks. Although the 
judge has wide discretion in setting fines, Tully said, amounts typically run 
about $100. 
</P>
<P>
Six two-man teams of firefighters and police officers will patrol the streets 
of Buena Park beginning at 6 p.m. on July 4, focusing on finding illegal 
fireworks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, patrol teams issued about six citations for illegal fireworks 
use, Tully said. Last year, joint police-fire teams wrote 22 citations and gave 
five warnings. This year, probably no one found with illegal fireworks will 
escape without a ticket, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, people have gotten the word and we won't have that problem," Tully 
said. "But we'll see how it goes." TOM McQUEENEY

FOOTHILL GROUP BACKS N. TUSTIN CITY PROPOSAL 
</P>

<DATELINE>

TUSTIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Foothill Communities Assn. board voted this week to support cityhood for 
the region, possibly as early as next year, said Bill Weber, the group's 
president. 
</P>
<P>
The association will encourage the formation of a group to bring the issue to a 
vote in 1991, Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
A survey taken at a town hall meeting showed general support for North Tustin 
becoming a city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in response to county supervisors' decision to disband the North 
Tustin Municipal Advisory Council, the Communities Assn. is expanding the scope 
and size of its land-use panel -- at least until the county replaces the 
council with another body. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the seven former members of the council are members of the land-use 
panel. The committee will meet on the second Monday of each month at 7:30 p.m. 
at Pomona First Federal Savings and Loan Assn., 17851 17th St.

PROPOSED SALE OF FRIENDLY FORD DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The proposed sale of troubled Friendly Ford was delayed Friday amid objections 
in federal bankruptcy court here that the $1.2-million price is too low and 
that thousands of car buyers who purchased extended warranties might be left 
unprotected. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Ryan scheduled a new hearing for Thursday to take 
additional testimony and to consider any new bids that might materialize for 
the high-volume Huntington Beach dealership. 
</P>
<P>
Friendly, which operated as Wilson Ford until last August, filed in April for 
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. The 
filing was made three days after the state attorney general's office filed a 
$3-million civil fraud suit against the dealership and several of its current 
and former principals and executives. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for several of the Huntington Beach dealership's major creditors 
objected Friday to the purchase of Friendly's major assets by Encino luxury car 
dealer Terry York because they fear there would not be enough proceeds to repay 
what they claim they are owed. 
</P>
<P>
York had originally agreed to pay almost $1.8 million, but the price has been 
slashed, largely because of the negative impact the fraud suit has had on 
Friendly's reputation and sales. 
</P>
<P>
A new issue that surfaced Friday is the situation of about 6,000 customers who 
purchased extended warranties from Friendly. 
</P>
<P>
The dealership is refusing, because of its bankruptcy status, to provide 
service under the warranties, many of which require that the repair work be 
done only at Friendly. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase agreement with York absolves him of any responsibility to honor 
the warranties should he take over the dealership. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, many of the warranties sold by what was then Wilson Ford were 
marketed by First Extended Service Corp. in Dallas -- a company owned by Texas 
auto dealer Carl Wescott, a former major shareholder of Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for First Extended said the only current recourse for extended 
warranty holders is to submit a claim to First Extended or its insurer. 
</P>
<P>
Wescott is one of several defendants named in the state's consumer fraud suit. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the suit alleges that Friendly, under that name and as 
Wilson Ford, used fraudulent sales techniques to pressure customers into buying 
the extended warranties at inflated prices, often for several thousand dollars. 
Even at an average of $1,000 each, the 6,000 warranties would have brought in a 
gross income of $6 million.

SPY PLANES AND FIRETRUCKS CAN EASE SUMMER DOLDRUMS FOR CHILDREN; 
</P>
<P>
ACTIVITIES: LOTS OF THINGS THAT ARE EDUCATIONAL ARE ALSO FUN. AND BESIDES THAT, 
THEY'RE ALL FREE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's the middle of a long summer. The children are bored, and you're looking 
for someplace different to take them, preferably someplace educational as well 
as fun. 
</P>
<P>
Well, there are plenty of tours designed for children and their parents. How 
about a tour of the Burbank Airport? Or a hands-on inspection of the equipment 
at a fire station? Maybe a close look at NASA spacecraft and an SR-71 spy 
plane? 
</P>
<P>
All of these and more are available, and all are free. Some are open only to 
organized groups; some have age limits; others accept everyone. Check before 
you go. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fire Stations 
</P>
<P>
Almost every fire department offers tours. But stay flexible; the tour may be 
interrupted by a call, or worse yet, you may arrive to find an empty fire 
station. 
</P>
<P>
For the Los Angeles City Fire Department, call the Public Information Office at 
(213) 485-6054 during normal business hours Monday through Friday. Don't try 
phoning individual fire stations -- as a rule, the telephones are not listed. 
Even if you know the number, they'll probably direct you to the information 
office. 
</P>
<P>
According to Firefighter Gary Svider, the office will take your address, locate 
the nearest fire station and arrange a tour time, usually a weekday between 10 
a.m. and 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Fire Department, which serves much of the Santa Clarita 
and Antelope valleys, has a similar policy. If you live in the Antelope Valley, 
contact the county Fire Department station in Lancaster at (805) 948-1180. In 
the Santa Clarita Valley area, call the Newhall station at (805) 253-7373. 
</P>
<P>
The county not only has fire stations but also firefighting helicopters, based 
at Whiteman Airport, 12605 Osborne St., Pacoima, and known as Air Operations. 
Tour requests can be made through the Public Information Office at (213) 
267-2411, at least a week ahead of time. Tours will probably be scheduled for 
the weekend and can be expected to take an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"An excellent time would be between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m., when the helicopters 
are taking off for their standby stations," said pilot Gary Bertz of the county 
Fire Department. "Otherwise, the choppers will only be static displays." 
</P>
<P>
Like fire stations, Air Operations is open to individuals or groups from a 
single family to about 40 people at a time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Airports 
</P>
<P>
There is something about airplanes and airports that appeals to almost 
everyone, and both major San Fernando Valley airports -- 
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena and Van Nuys -- have organized tours. 
</P>
<P>
At Van Nuys Airport, which caters to general aviation and is one of the busiest 
facilities in the country, the tour program is geared for visitors 6 years old 
and up. Booked in advance, the tour starts at 10 a.m. Mondays through Fridays 
until September. After that, tours shift to being scheduled at 9:30 a.m. and 11 
a.m. They last about an hour and 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors board an airport bus and tour the airfield with the aid of a guide, 
stopping at various points of interest. For example, they see how mechanics 
maintain and work on corporate jet aircraft, watch brand-new jets being 
customized and get a close look at the many aircraft that regularly visit the 
airport. The California Air National Guard and its Lockheed C-130s are no 
longer stationed here -- they moved to Point Mugu near Oxnard -- but visitors 
can sometimes tour the inside of a corporate jet and see what the cockpit looks 
like. Unfortunately, the control tower is off limits. 
</P>
<P>
There is an observation area off Waterman Drive near Woodley Avenue where 
picnic benches have been installed, so you can grab a bite and at the same time 
watch the many landings and takeoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Information about Van Nuys Airport tours can be obtained by calling (818) 
785-8838. 
</P>
<P>
At Burbank Airport, which caters to both general and commercial aviation, tours 
are scheduled almost every day for various organized groups, although you will 
still have to call for an appointment. 
</P>
<P>
"Our tours start on the outside of the terminal building and work their way 
in," said guide Pat O'Donoghue. "We show people the baggage service, skycaps, 
our Police Department and the noise monitoring system." Other highlights 
include the security checkpoints, an explanation of the baggage X-ray system, 
and when available, the inside of a commercial jet and a peek at a cockpit. 
Tours of the control tower may occasionally be arranged, for adults only. 
</P>
<P>
An airport history display documents the continual evolutionary changes of the 
airport, including photographs taken during World War II, when it was 
camouflaged to look like a pasture in aerial views. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of times a week, O'Donoghue said, Sherlock, the Department of 
Agriculture beagle, visits the luggage area to sniff out fruit (remember, 
Burbank is in the Medfly quarantine area). 
</P>
<P>
For more information, contact the airport tour office at (818) 840-8840. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Post Office 
</P>
<P>
Ever drop a letter through the post office mail slot and wonder what fate has 
in store for it? Sure, it's addressed to Sacramento, but that doesn't mean it 
won't wind up in Poughkeepsie. 
</P>
<P>
Some local post offices will allow group tours, said John Conte of the U.S. 
Postal Service. Their telephone numbers can be found in the white pages of the 
telephone book under United States Government. 
</P>
<P>
A guaranteed tour for everyone, however, is at the Van Nuys general mail 
facility, which is where local post offices bring their mail for sorting and 
routing. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people don't realize what a letter goes through after someone drops it 
through the slot," said postal worker Pat Lonsinger. "Everyone sees the letter 
carrier or the person behind the counter, but they're amazed at all the 
equipment necessary to process the mail." 
</P>
<P>
What visitors will see includes anything from ordinary mail bags to exotic 
canceling machines and automatic character readers, bundling equipment and 
weighing machines. Individuals, families and organized groups up to 30 are 
welcome. 
</P>
<P>
The Van Nuys mail distribution center is at 15701 Sherman Way in Van Nuys, 
(818) 908-6625. Call at least one day in advance to make an appointment for a 
one-hour tour, taking place at 4:30 p.m. or 6:30 p.m. Tuesday, Wednesday or 
Thursday. There are even free coloring books for the children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Police Station 
</P>
<P>
Ever wonder if the real police act like Kojak, Columbo or Joe Friday? If you're 
a resident of San Fernando or Burbank, you can find out for yourself. 
</P>
<P>
"Visitors get to see the entire facility, from the jail, to communications and 
vehicles, to where the detectives work and the briefing room," said Sgt. Bill 
Green, 35, of the San Fernando Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
The department welcomes organized groups and school tours of up to about 60 
people, but because of time constraints, it can't handle individual requests. 
</P>
<P>
Tours are scheduled for Wednesdays any time from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., but you'll 
have to make an appointment at least two weeks in advance. The tour takes about 
an hour. For information, call (818) 898-1254. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who visit the Burbank police station will not only get a tour, said 
Lt. Duane Dow, but a demonstration on how the sirens and lights work on the 
patrol cars, as well as a peek at the booking office. The jail area is off 
limits, however. 
</P>
<P>
"It's primarily aimed at elementary and junior high school children," said Dow, 
"and we prefer groups no larger than 15." Appointments for the Monday through 
Friday tours must be made a week in advance. 
</P>
<P>
And there's more. 
</P>
<P>
The Burbank Police Department has an evening ride-along program for adult city 
employees and residents (sorry, no children) where they can tag along with the 
cops. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose is to let citizens actually see how the police function and get 
firsthand knowledge of what goes on out there," said Dow. The program starts 
with a tour of the station and winds up with a three-hour stint in a patrol 
car, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"All you have to do is call and say, 'I'd like to be a part of the ride-along 
program,' " he said. "You'll be contacted by an officer on the swing shift, be 
asked to fill out an application form, and then we'll accommodate you as 
quickly as we can." Both men and women are invited to participate. 
</P>
<P>
For the daytime station tour, contact the Burbank Police Department watch 
commander at (818) 953-8744 before 3 p.m. For the evening adult-only ride-along 
program, ask for the watch commander at the same telephone number after 3 p.m. 
The station is at 272 E. Olive Ave. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese Garden 
</P>
<P>
Unlikely as it may sound, in the middle of the efficient and ultra-modern 
Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant at 6100 Woodley Ave. is a 6 1/2-acre 
Japanese Garden, complete with a lake and teahouse, available for public tours. 
</P>
<P>
No tours are available inside the surrounding reclamation plant, since it is 
being expanded to allow for a higher volume of water. 
</P>
<P>
No children under 12 are allowed on the one-hour Japanese Garden Tour, which is 
scheduled every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday at 9 a.m. and 10:15 a.m. by 
appointment only. Call (818) 989-8166 for information. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Space Base 
</P>
<P>
Future astronauts as well as those who remember being in awe of John Glenn's 
three orbits around the Earth might be interested in the NASA Museum at Edwards 
Air Force Base, near Rosemond in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a 24-minute movie explaining the history of the facility as well as 
the various major programs that are going on now," said NASA's Don Haley, 
"followed by a walk through the main hangar to see the airplanes we use." 
</P>
<P>
The exact equipment may vary, depending on what is being used that day, but 
includes research versions of the FA-18 Hornet and the F-15 Eagle, and the 
oldest B-52 still flying -- it once carried the X-15 rocket plane. Raising the 
heart rate of exotic-airplane enthusiasts everywhere, the last active Lockheed 
SR-71 reconnaissance aircraft also is on view. Recently retired from the U.S. 
Air Force, the Mach 3, meaning the craft can attain a speed of about 2,000 
m.p.h., the once-super-secret spy plane is now flying exclusively for NASA, 
performing high-altitude test flights. 
</P>
<P>
Reservations are needed for the tours, which are at 10:15 a.m. and 1:15 p.m. 
Monday through Friday. Everyone is invited; just call ahead and see when they 
can fit you in. 
</P>
<P>
Edwards Air Force Base is northeast of Lancaster off California 14. For 
additional information and exact directions, call (805) 258-3446.

ONCE-ENDANGERED PEREGRINE FALCON IS MAKING A SPECTACULAR COMEBACK; 
</P>
<P>
WILDLIFE: THEIR POPULATION HAS SOARED TO 540 AFTER A 15-YEAR EFFORT. BUT SOME 
WORRY THAT THE RECOVERY EFFORT COULD FACE A PREMATURE DEATH.

The peregrine falcon, once reduced to fewer than 100 pairs in the United 
States, is making a comeback. Now hundreds can be seen swooping off cliffs, 
ledges and even skyscrapers. 
</P>
<P>
After 15 years and millions of dollars, conservationists say that in a few 
years, the species will no longer need special protection. They are worried, 
though, that legislators will decide that the special protection is not needed 
now. 
</P>
<P>
"It's progressed marvelously. It's probably not true that the bird is widely 
endangered now," said Jim Enderson, a Colorado College biologist who leads a 
federal peregrine recovery team. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a model program nationally," said Brad Blodget, Massachusetts' state 
ornithologist. "It's a victory story." 
</P>
<P>
Enderson estimates that the government could probably change the bird's 
classification from endangered to threatened, or even take it off such lists 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
This is big news for the peregrine. There were once about 300 pairs in the 
eastern United States, and many more in the West, but the population was hard 
hit in the 1950s by DDT and other pesticides. By 1975, there were fewer than 
100 pairs were counted in the entire continental United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We were basically starting from zero," Blodget said. 
</P>
<P>
Groups such as the based Peregrine Fund in Boise, Ida., set about reintroducing 
the falcon, importing hatchlings from Canada, Scotland, Argentina and other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
DDT was banned for nearly all purposes. The federal government earmarked about 
$300,000 a year for captive falcon breeding, and some states even put check-off 
options on their tax forms to make it easier for the public to contribute to 
the cause. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the efforts have cost "many millions of dollars," said Bill 
Burnham, Peregrine Fund president. The fund spends about $800,000 a year on 
peregrine recovery. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot cheaper to take care of the environment rather than trying to go in 
afterward and put them back after you lose them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Falcon recovery is not just a simple matter of importing birds from other 
countries and releasing them here, experts say. Recovery is expensive, partly 
because mortality rates can be as high as 50% in the bird's first year, and 
they are about 15% thereafter, Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
The fund will release its 3,000th falcon this year, Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 540 falcon pairs in the United States today. There are 
about 100 pairs in the Grand Canyon, about 90 in California, at least 85 in the 
Northeast, and about 17 in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the pesticide situation does not change for the worse, it's 
unlikely that this bird is going to be in trouble in the foreseeable future," 
Enderson said. 
</P>
<P>
But other conservationists are less sanguine. 
</P>
<P>
"We're about two-thirds of the way there," Burnham said. "As far as the release 
of the peregrines go, there's probably a need for another six to seven years." 
</P>
<P>
The birds are still remain scarce in Idaho, where only three pairs have been 
counted, and in other places. Conservationists say they are keeping their eyes 
on Washington, hoping Congress does not cut back the program too soon. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the worst things you can do is put a lot of energy into restoration and 
then stop it," said Tom French, head of the Massachusetts endangered species 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The falcons also face a threat from urbanization. Some peregrines have headed 
for the cities, perching on high-rise buildings. There are nine pairs that 
swoop and dive among the skyscrapers and bridges of New York City, and a group 
nesting on a 23-story building in Springfield, Mass., have become stars on a 
local cable TV show. 
</P>
<P>
But with city life comes hazards such as high wires, airplanes and plate-glass 
windows. Conservationists worry that these could cripple their breeding 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, one of the adult males flew over the airport and was hit by an 
airplane and killed, right in the middle of breeding season," said Pat Redig, 
head of the Midwest-based Raptor Center. "I've seen those things happen with 
enough frequency to cause me to be concerned about the fragility of our 
population."

PEST CONTROL WITHOUT PESTICIDES

Sharon Whatley likes to know what her family is eating. 
</P>
<P>
And it's not always easy to find out. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no way to tell what is sprayed on vegetables and fruit before they 
get to the supermarket, and I wanted to have control over that," said the 
Tustin resident. 
</P>
<P>
She started a garden in her back yard six years ago to ensure that her family 
ate only naturally grown, chemical-free produce. 
</P>
<P>
Then the bugs invaded her pure environment. 
</P>
<P>
"When I began to get garden pests and went to the nursery for advice, they 
suggested I use harsh chemical methods, which defeated the whole purpose of 
having a garden," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Whatley began searching for alternatives to chemical pest control. She 
conducted research on her own and then hooked up with the Orange County Organic 
Gardening Club. She now controls pests organically. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Organic Gardening Club offers members and guests educational 
programs, speakers and demonstrations. The group meets every second Tuesday of 
the month at Mercury Federal Savings in Tustin. Seventy families are members of 
the 25-year-old club. 
</P>
<P>
Club members say you can trash the chemicals and start fresh. By using 
alternative pest-control methods, back-yard gardeners avoid the harmful effects 
of chemicals in the soil and on the produce. 
</P>
<P>
"Your first line of defense against pests is to have healthy plants," said Bud 
Anderson, vice president of the Organic Gardening Club. "When plants become 
stressed because of lack of water or nutrition or start aging, pests will 
attack them." 
</P>
<P>
Insects are attracted to yellow -- the color of sickly plants. "Yellow means 
food to them," said Sharron Clark, a professor of biology at Golden West 
College who will teach a class on alternative methods of garden maintenance 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Problems can be prevented by selecting strong, healthy green plants. After 
planting, be sure to keep the area free of debris and remove any yellowing 
leaves or ailing plants. 
</P>
<P>
Another important element to consider during plant selection is disease 
resistance. You can prevent infestations by choosing plants that can ward off 
certain devastating diseases. 
</P>
<P>
When selecting tomato plants, for instance, look for the VFN label, which 
indicates that the plant is resistant to three main types of deadly soil-borne 
diseases. Seed packages also indicate that plants are resistant. 
</P>
<P>
Pests thrive, too, on young, tender plants. Start seeds in containers and 
transplant them when they're the size of plants found in the nursery. 
</P>
<P>
"To protect transplants, put a newspaper collar around the stems," said Clark. 
"This will keep cutworms and other pests away. As the plants grow, the 
newspaper will disintegrate." 
</P>
<P>
Once pesky insects are spotted, there are several organic chemical control 
methods that can be used. Insecticidal soaps are a popular, safe way to 
suffocate aphids, white flies and mealybugs, while not harming friendly 
predators such as lacewings, ladybugs and praying mantises. These soap 
solutions can be made at home or purchased. 
</P>
<P>
To mix your own, put a few drops of dish detergent into water and spray it on 
your plants. If you want a stronger solution, mix fresh onion juice, garlic and 
hot pepper into the soapy water. After some experimentation, every gardener 
comes up with his or her own favorite mixture. 
</P>
<P>
Effective, readily biodegradable insecticidal soaps -- like Safer -- can be 
found in most gardening centers. These are designed to kill aphids, mealybugs, 
whiteflies, mites, tent caterpillars, thrips and other destructive pests. Spray 
in the early morning or late afternoon to avoid leaf burn. 
</P>
<P>
Another chemical that acts as a stomach poison for beetles, thrips, weevils and 
borers is Rotenone, which is an extract from the roots of tropical legumes. It 
is usually found in a combination spray with Pyrethrum. This comes from the 
flower heads of the Pyrethrum Chrysanthemum, a form of the daisy found in 
Africa. Pyrethrum kills leaf hoppers, thrips, whiteflies and aphids. 
</P>
<P>
When using organic chemical sprays, keep in mind that their effects don't last 
long, which is why they don't become part of your food. If pests persist, 
sprays must be reapplied. 
</P>
<P>
Another form of controlling pests is through biological means. "So that we are 
not overrun by any one species in nature, organisms feed on one another," said 
Clark. "You can use such biological controls in your own garden." 
</P>
<P>
A good cure for soil-borne pests such as pill bugs, sow bugs, snails and slugs 
is Diatamascious Earth. "This is made up of the shells of a small sea creature 
which is mined from the ocean floor," said Anderson. "When it is mixed into the 
soil, the pests eat them and the sharp edges tear up their insides." 
</P>
<P>
Another control is the bacteria Bacillus Thuringiensis, which can kill all 
kinds of caterpillars, fly larvae and worms. "When you see holes in leaves and 
vegetables such as tomatoes and actual caterpillars and worms on your plants, 
spray them with this solution and the pests will soon die from eating the 
leaves and ingesting the bacteria, which poisons their guts," said Clark. This 
product is sold under the brand names Attack and Dipel and is readily 
available. 
</P>
<P>
You can also control pests by introducing certain "good" insects into your 
garden, such as ladybugs, praying mantises, lacewings, spiders and wasps. Many 
of these can be bought at the nursery and set free in your garden. 
</P>
<P>
Barrier methods are also effective in controlling some pests. Whatley has found 
that a shallow pan or dish filled with stale beer and soap stops snails as they 
attempt to climb into her garden. Salt also harms the troublemakers. Stop 
snails by putting salt on cardboard strips and placing them around the 
outskirts of your garden. Avoid getting salt into the soil. 
</P>
<P>
Netting is another effective barrier method for plants such as broccoli and 
cauliflower. This prevents the white cabbage butterfly and other similar 
insects from laying eggs on the plants. 
</P>
<P>
Certain companion plants deter pests. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of their pungent odor, marigolds ward off many pests," said Anderson, 
who has them planted throughout his garden. Nasturtiums are attractive flowers 
that repel aphids and squash bugs. Plant them near cabbage, lettuce, squash and 
radishes. Some herbs are also useful. 
</P>
<P>
"We enjoy the odor and taste of sweet basil, but tomato and cabbage worms don't 
like it," said Anderson. Mint, too, deters many pests that affect cabbage and 
tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Don't bunch similar crops in the same area. "Nature doesn't have all of the 
same tree in one spot or a meadow filled with pure grass," said Clark. "When we 
plant all one crop in one area, we upset the balance of nature, and this 
encourages pests, because each type tends to feed on similar crops. 
</P>
<P>
"For instance, if you have rows of lettuce, the insects who feed on that will 
move readily from plant to plant and destroy your crop. However, if you 
interplant dissimilar crops between rows and within rows, when an insect is 
feeding on lettuce and then moves over to radishes, it is likely to find this 
vegetable distasteful." 
</P>
<P>
Many organic gardeners use truly simple solutions: water and picking bugs off 
leaves. Aphids can often be killed with a strong jet of water, while many 
caterpillars, worms and snails can be picked from plants. To catch sow bugs and 
pill bugs, place a piece of wood in the garden and they will crawl under it. 
"Don't kill the blue sow bugs, though," said Clark. "They have a disease that 
will kill the other ones." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, no garden is going to be completely free of pests. "You're not 
insect-proof, you're insect- and pest-deterrent," explained Anderson. "You must 
remember that all of the 'pests' are there for a reason -- they actually have a 
place in the earth's continuum. We don't want to destroy everything, which is 
why alternative methods work so well. They create a natural balance in your 
garden." 
</P>
<P>
Since she started using alternative methods, Whatley's pest problems have 
decreased. "Five years ago, when I used toxic chemical controls, I constantly 
battled pests," she said. "Today I don't have very many problems. My garden is 
really healthy, and I'm able to eat produce that is chemical-free." 
</P>

Like mischievous gremlins, teddy bears have multiplied like mad and taken over 
the home of Rosemary and Paul Volpp. 
</P>
<P>
There are bears everywhere inside their two-story Buena Park residence -- 
sitting on top of the refrigerator, napping under the coffee table, overflowing 
from bookshelves and china cabinets and just making themselves comfortable on 
tables, beds, dressers and the mantle above the fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
There's King Arthur, a rare 1904 Steiff holding court in his red velvet cape, 
inside a curio cabinet; Bo and Dearheart, two 1905 creations of the Steiff Co. 
in what is now West Germany, cavorting in a crib, and Poirot, a contemporary 
bear who sits in the Volpp's bathroom in his shower cap, waiting for his turn 
to bathe. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been waiting two years," Rosemary says. 
</P>
<P>
The Volpps have about 5,000 teddy bears, one of the largest collections in the 
world -- probably even the largest, the Volpps say. Those bears that can't fit 
in the home have been put in storage -- enough bears to fill 100 boxes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was getting to where we couldn't walk around in here," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The Volpps collect bears big and small, from a six-foot, 1970s Steiff bear made 
for display in a toy store who greets visitors at their front door to a bear so 
tiny that it can fit inside a walnut shell. 
</P>
<P>
"A bear is a bear is a bear," Rosemary says. 
</P>
<P>
They have bears of all ages, from the earliest prototypes made in the 1900s to 
contemporary "artist" bears. 
</P>
<P>
Artist bears are handcrafted, elaborately dressed bears that can sell for 
several thousand dollars even when they're new. Often they're numbered and 
issued by the artist in limited edition, just like a fine print. 
</P>
<P>
The Volpps have one of eight special-edition teddy bears made for Whoopi 
Goldberg when the comedian was a presenter for a Make-A-Wish Foundation 
benefit. The teddy, dubbed Whoopi Goldbear, wears dreadlocks and sequined 
sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a Southern belle bear with an elaborate cream-colored satin gown, 
Little Bear Riding Hood in a red cape, a Cinderella bear, a Theodore Roosevelt 
bear in his riding outfit, a Statue of Liberty bear, a bear dressed up as 
Father Christmas in a red-velvet, fur-trimmed cape and even a crazy bear in a 
straitjacket. 
</P>
<P>
"I call that one a self-portrait," Rosemary jokes. 
</P>
<P>
Old bears, meanwhile, attract the couple because they wear the badges of their 
previous owners' affection. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary loves bears that look well loved, their mohair fur matted or bald in 
spots from too much play, their button eyes scratched. 
</P>
<P>
"If they could only talk," she says, admiring their furry faces. 
</P>
<P>
Many of their old bears are rare, including the celebrity bear, Aloysius, a 
patched-up 1907 Steiff featured in the British TV miniseries "Brideshead 
Revisited," and a bear identical to the original Winnie the Pooh bought at 
Harrod's in London for Christopher Robin, son of Pooh author A.A. Milne. 
</P>
<P>
Among the older bears, those made by the Steiff Co. in Germany in the early 
1900s are the most sought after by collectors. These childhood toys, revered 
for the quality of their workmanship, are bought and sold by adults for 
thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Hans-Otto Steiff, the company's ambassador, has called the Volpp's collection 
of Steiff and other bears "unequaled in the world as to rarity and quality." 
</P>
<P>
While the Volpps have uncounted Steiffs, among their favorites are Bo and 
Dearheart, 24-inch golden-haired bears with center seams down the middle of 
their faces. During its first years in the bear-making business, Steiff was 
frugal and used remnants of mohair for the faces of some of the bears, making 
them an especially rare find today. 
</P>
<P>
The Volpps enjoy dressing and displaying their bears just as much as they like 
adding to the collection. 
</P>
<P>
The couple has orchestrated bear wedding parties, bear beach outings, bear 
hayrides, bear fishing trips. They've dressed the bears as cheerleaders, 
Dracula, baseball players, chefs, an ice cream man and Hawaii-bound tourists. 
At Halloween, the bears wear pumpkin suits, at Christmas they wear Santa hats 
and at Thanksgiving they're dressed like pilgrims. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary's 82-year-old mother, Marie Chidesta, makes most of the bears' 
costumes. 
</P>
<P>
The Volpps give each of their bears a name and often endow them with a 
personality. 
</P>
<P>
"The bears kind of talk to you," Paul says. 
</P>
<P>
Ambrose, a copper-colored Steiff made about 1907, arrived in the mail that 
afternoon wearing a green velvet suit. Paul swears that the bear looks ornery. 
</P>
<P>
"He hates that suit. I think he's worn it long enough to be upset. He may even 
bite," Paul tells Rosemary. 
</P>
<P>
The Volpps don't regard bears as investments. 
</P>
<P>
"It bothers me when Steiff comes out with limited-edition bears and people buy 
(one), thinking it will double in value in a couple of years. It will not," 
Rosemary says. 
</P>
<P>
While they prefer bears made with mohair fur, jointed limbs and a cone-shaped 
nose that isn't too long, they'll take any bear whose overall appearance makes 
them feel "comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
"One of the best ways to measure a bear is if it makes you smile," Rosemary 
says. "Some will make you laugh out loud." 
</P>
<P>
The Volpps began collecting bears in 1982, joining what has become the 
fourth-largest adult hobby in the United States, according to Rosemary. 
</P>
<P>
Paul already had impressive collections of antique model trains and full-size 
trucks. While at a model train and toy show, a friend of Paul teased Rosemary 
into buying her first bear, a North American Bear Co. creation she bought for 
$42 and named Amelia Bearheart. A similar bear recently sold at auction for 
about $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, bears have found their way into the Volpp home via all kinds of 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
"The bears come with crazy stories. One woman sold us her childhood bear 
because she needed money for a furnace," Paul says. 
</P>
<P>
They found Tucker, a 1903 caramel-colored Steiff, at an estate auction. He had 
been sitting nearly untouched for decades in an old Arrow shirt box. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of sad," Rosemary says. "I wonder why nobody played with him." 
</P>
<P>
Grand Fellow, a 28-inch 1905 Steiff, came in a barrel, "wrapped unceremoniously 
around the good china," Paul says. 
</P>
<P>
The Volpps love to get a bear directly from its original owners. Paul recalls 
when two well-dressed, elderly women approached Rosemary at a bear show: 
</P>
<P>
"One of them said, 'I have my childhood bear, would you like to see her?' The 
bear was a collector's dream -- one of the first bears made by Ideal. She'd 
bought it in 1904." 
</P>
<P>
The woman liked Rosemary and would sell it only to her. 
</P>
<P>
Often, old people sell their childhood bears to the Volpps because they know 
that the couple will give them a good home instead of selling them to the 
highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't sell bears, we collect them," Rosemary says. "Unfortunately, we keep 
picking them up." 
</P>
<P>
The Volpps adopt the bears, calling them by the same name used by the original 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd be surprised how many people name their bears Teddy," Rosemary says. 
"When we get a Teddy, we usually add on another name." 
</P>
<P>
Teddy Long John, a 1905 Steiff, got his name when he underwent repairs and was 
found to be stuffed with old underwear. The Steiff factory sometimes used old 
rags when workers ran out of stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
The Volpps also have picked up rare bear memorabilia, including a sketch of a 
little bear by Washington Post cartoonist Clifford Berryman that appeared on 
all of his cartoons depicting Theodore Roosevelt, for whom teddy bears are 
named. 
</P>
<P>
The couple travels up to 40,000 miles a year to teddy bear conventions 
sponsored by collector clubs, giving slide shows and exhibits of their bears. 
</P>
<P>
They write a column for the Teddy Bear and Friends magazine, telling other 
collectors how to best display their collections, and they've written three 
books on decorating with bears. 
</P>
<P>
Paul, who turned his construction machinery business over to his son and 
son-in-law, spends much of his time photographing the bears in their costumes 
for the books and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
While the Volpps try to keep from buying more bears, they have trouble 
resisting bears when they attend a show. 
</P>
<P>
"A bear will jump out at you and you'll take that one," Rosemary says. At the 
Volpp home, there's always room for one more. 
</P>
<P>
The International League of Teddy Bear Clubs will hold a teddy bear show and 
sale today from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Doubletree Hotel at the City, 100 The 
City Drive, Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is $3 for adults, $1.50 for children, with proceeds used to buy bears 
for the Orangewood Children's Foundation.

JUDGE THE AFTEREFFECTS . . .;

<P>
. . . BEFORE REMODELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAY BERMAN, Jay Berman is a writer based in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Westminster builder Dennis D'Ambra likes to point out that nobody ever said a 
blueprint was worth a thousand words. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, for generations, anyone planning to build or remodel a house has had to 
rely on blueprints as a primary indicator of what the finished project was 
going to look like. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, D'Ambra believes, is that many homeowners don't know how to read 
blueprints. "They'll tell me, 'I saw the blueprint, but it confused me,' " says 
D'Ambra, 47, president of D'Ambra Inc. "Or they'll say, 'That's not what I 
thought it would look like.' The result is that we sometimes have to tear out a 
wall or practically start all over again. That can take a lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
By chance, D'Ambra made a discovery several months ago that is changing the way 
people look at remodeling -- literally. He read a newspaper advertisement 
placed by a landscaping firm that used computer imaging to show potential 
clients what specific trees or shrubs would look like around their homes or 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
"A light bulb went on in my head," D'Ambra said. "I thought, if computer 
imaging can be used as a 'before-and-after' tool for landscaping, why can't we 
do it in home remodeling?" 
</P>
<P>
The result is that D'Ambra's firm can show clients exactly what their home will 
look like after remodeling. The blueprints are still used by the people at the 
job site, of course, but the customer sees either a video or a still picture 
before any work is done. 
</P>
<P>
"It eliminates trial and error," D'Ambra said. "And it eliminates questions and 
misunderstanding. Nothing is left to the imagination." 
</P>
<P>
After first realizing that computer imaging could be useful in remodeling, 
D'Ambra and his son, Chris, 21, went to Canoga Park, where they met with 
officials of New Image Industries, which manufactures computer imaging software 
for other applications. In addition to landscaping projections, computer 
imaging has been used to show would-be dieters what they'll look like after 
dropping a few pounds and by plastic surgeons whose patients are eager to see 
what a face-lift or eyelid tuck would do for them. New Image also manufactures 
the hardware for the system. 
</P>
<P>
The system that New Image designed for D'Ambra allows Chris, now officially the 
construction firm's "image designer," to incorporate a virtually infinite 
number of roof-lines, door styles, driveways and other features into the image 
of a client's house. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't come cheaply. D'Ambra estimates that he paid more than $35,000 for 
the package. 
</P>
<P>
The results have been "dramatic," he said. "We keep putting new styles of homes 
into the database," he says, "and people can choose any feature they want and 
see what it would look like on their house." The charge to the client is about 
$100, applicable to any job the client might order from the firm. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone may say, 'I liked a roof-line I saw at a place in Laguna Hills,' " 
D'Ambra says. Or they might like the roof from one place, the window treatment 
from a second and the driveway from a third. Want a bay window moved around? 
Like to see a double door? 
</P>
<P>
"If it's in our database," D'Ambra says, "Chris can take the photo of their 
house, along with what they've said they want, and show them what they're 
looking for almost instantly. If it isn't, if they can give him a picture of 
what they want, within an hour to a day, he can show them what they had in 
mind, but on their house. 
</P>
<P>
"He can put a (Lamborghini) Countache in your driveway if you'd like, but we 
don't include the car with the deal." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, a client can see what the newly remodeled family home would look 
like in virtually any color. "You want yellow?" D'Ambra asks. "We can call up 
every shade of yellow. If you prefer a beige, you've got it. The system stores 
more than 32,000 colors. Want to see what the house will look like early in the 
morning or late in the afternoon? We can change the time of day or the angle of 
the shadow." 
</P>
<P>
Clients who want to see a video, rather than a still picture, of the proposed 
project get something even more exotic. The image, of course, starts when one 
of D'Ambra's sales employees goes to the client's home and shoots the "before" 
video. "If neighbors are walking by when we're shooting the video," D'Ambra 
says, "or a kid on a skateboard races past, they're going to show up on the 
'after' video too, moving past a house that doesn't even exist yet in that 
form." 
</P>
<P>
When working, Chris D'Ambra sits at a high-tech console surrounded by vinyl 
folders labeled "windows and doors," "exterior finishes," "roofs, fireplaces 
and brick," "new homes" and "driveways and steps." Cars and people can easily 
be superimposed on the property, he points out, jokingly placing a likeness of 
former President Ronald Reagan on the front walkway of a Whittier home 
("President Richard Nixon is not in our database," Dennis says). 
</P>
<P>
The new system has been especially helpful for clients who have no special 
features in mind, D'Ambra says. And there are a few clients like that. "People 
will come to us and say, 'I don't know what I want. You're the builder. You 
come up with an idea,' " he says. "Others want their house to look like 
(Donald) Trump's Taj Mahal." 
</P>
<P>
D'Ambra Inc. has been in Westminster since the senior D'Ambra and his wife 
founded it in 1967 -- "when you could start with next to nothing," he adds. 
"You can't do that today." He has always fancied himself a "high-tech thinker," 
and the computer imaging equipment, he believes, makes his the only remodeling 
firm in Southern California with such a system. 
</P>
<P>
Since he started using computer imaging late last year, his firm has completed 
50 to 60 jobs -- everything from simple room additions to cases in which, he 
says, "someone doesn't want to move and wants to spend $100,000 to make his 
house look like a $700,000 place down the block." About 80% of his work 
consists of second-floor additions. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, only about 30% of his clients have asked to use the computer 
imaging equipment, probably because many of them already know what they want. 
</P>
<P>
Since the system is unique to the area, D'Ambra allows other builders -- many 
of them his competitors -- to use it, for a price. "Why not?" he asks. "There's 
nothing cloak-and-dagger about it. If everyone can benefit, there's no reason 
to keep it from them. This has given us a lot of exposure within the industry. 
We get a lot of calls." 
</P>
<P>
D'Ambra handles about 100 projects a year, all within a 20- to 25-mile radius 
from his office, "but at least 80% in Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley, 
because that's where we're known. What we're doing is taking little houses and 
putting houses on top of them. We're bringing 1960s houses into the 1990s," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, his computer-generated photos are as realistic as they need to be. 
D'Ambra recently sought a zoning variance for a client from the Westminster 
Planning Commission. The man wanted a special garage built to house his boat. 
With a briefcase full of blueprints and a computer picture showing what he 
proposed to do, D'Ambra approached an inspector. "He looked at it," D'Ambra 
said, "and asked why we would want a variance for something that had already 
been built. He gave us the variance."

ONE WAY TO REFINISH A DYED CONCRETE WALK

Q. Our house was built in 1955 when painting the concrete around your property 
was popular. The walkway in our back yard is red, and there doesn't seem to be 
any way to remove the old paint. Any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
A.G., 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
A. Actually, it's probably not paint but dye. Paint generally fades out after a 
number of years. However, to prevent fading (and to the dismay of later 
homeowners) many contractors mixed concrete with dye to make this outdoor 
decoration permanent. However, according to Tony Arquette of General 
Landscaping of Orange, there is a way to mask your walkway short of tearing it 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"Depending on the condition of the concrete, in many cases you can cover it 
with flagstone, tile or brick. The new covering is mortared directly over the 
concrete. If the walkway is pitted and there are holes, you'll have to cover 
them to create an even surface. Then, just follow the manufacturer's 
instructions for installing the tile or stone." 
</P>
<P>
Q. We need a new front door, and I've resolved to do it myself. It looks like a 
pretty straightforward job, but is there anything I should know before I start? 
</P>
<P>
B.L., Tustin 
</P>
<P>
A. Door hangers earn a good living for what appears to be a simple job. 
However, whenever you're working with a large heavy object that has to have a 
precise fit, you're asking for trouble. Perhaps the best advice is to leave the 
project to professionals. But if you're determined to tackle it yourself, 
expect it to take all day. 
</P>
<P>
"After you get the old door, hinges and strike plates off, measure and plane 
the door if necessary until it precisely fits the opening," says Rod Keeler of 
S &amp; K Door and Window in El Toro. "Stand the door in the frame and then 
plane a little at a time until you've got the fit you want. Remember to shave 
off a little at a time; you can't replace the shavings if you make the door too 
small. 
</P>
<P>
"You should have a clearance of about 1/8 inch on either side. Now comes the 
tricky part of fitting the hinges. Slide a piece of wood under the door to 
elevate it at least 1/4 inch. Now mark the position of the top hinge. The top 
hinge should be six inches to seven inches from the top of the door and the 
bottom hinge should be 10 inches to 12 inches from the floor. If you're 
installing a middle hinge, that should be equidistant from the others. Mark the 
hinge positions on both the door and the jamb. 
</P>
<P>
"If the existing mortises in the door jamb are still good you can reuse them. 
But first, fill all the screw holes with slivers of wood coated with cream 
glue. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have to make new mortises, determine the size by holding one leaf of 
the hinge in place against the wood and tracing it. Then carve the outline of 
the hinge with a chisel. Using short, shallow cuts, chisel out the wood inside 
the outline and made the bottom of the mortise as flat and even as you can. 
After you've got it so the hinge fits flatly into the space, again, remembering 
that you've got to shave a little at a time, drill holes into the door and jamb 
and install the hinge. 
</P>
<P>
"Set the door up and screw it into the wall. If you're lucky, it will open and 
close perfectly. If it doesn't, check to make sure you haven't made the hinges 
too high or low in their mortises. The hinge has to be absolutely flush in both 
the door and the jamb for it to fit properly. If it's not, remove it and shave 
it again, or use a piece of cardboard as a shim to build it up." 
</P>
<P>
Q. I've heard that it's not difficult to create a sunken tub without replacing 
your existing tub. Is that true? 
</P>
<P>
B.T., Buena Park 
</P>
<P>
A. Short of punching a hole in your bathroom floor, you can't do it. However, 
there is a way to make it look like you have a sunken tub. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an easy trick done by creating a second bathtub enclosure," says plumber 
Andy McNeil of Irvine. "Create a frame with 2-by-4s that is parallel to the one 
around the tub, but it's extended out about 12 to 18 inches. Then, cover the 
tops and sides of your frames with 1/2-inch plywood or waterproof wallboard, 
and caulk all the junctures between the tub and the frame. You complete it by 
covering with your chosen material, whether it's tile or vinyl covering."
