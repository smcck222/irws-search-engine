Obviously, Reichl has been to Hillhurst Avenue. How could she have left out 
Duplex? The restaurant is beautiful and pleasant, the atmosphere warm and 
friendly, the service excellent and, most important, the food is exquisite 
(innovative but not crazy) and, surprisingly, moderately priced.

Reichl's pompous and arrogant statements condemning any location out of the 
Westside are evident. For example, Pasadena "doesn't seem to support any real 
culinary innovation." 
</P>
<P>
Is Fino in Torrance "worth the trip? Probably not." Fresco in Glendale: " . . . 
the effect is to make you feel that you're in some small town (well, actually, 
you are)." Sorrento Grille in Laguna Beach: "Orange County, after all, is the 
place that only yesterday prided itself on offering footstools and roses to the 
ladies . . . and enormous bills to the gentlemen." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles is a diversified and large city. Perhaps Reichl should stop 
adhering to the Gertrude Stein philosophy ("There is no there there") of 
restaurant reviewing and begin acting like a food critic for the second biggest 
city in America.

"Ruth Reichl's Top 40 Restaurants" (May 6) was a delight. Not only was the 
article written in a very readable manner, but Reichl also put in a personal 
touch about each and every restaurant.

Does Ruth Reichl think that the San Fernando Valley has seceded from Los 
Angeles? In her listing of her top 40 restaurants, she lists not one single 
restaurant in the Valley. How about The Bistro Garden? Vals in Toluca Lake? 
They're as fine as anything over the hill.

Having been a regular at L'Orangerie for some years now, I couldn't believe 
that it wasn't included amongst Los Angeles' finest. I was even more shocked 
when Reichl stated: "L'Orangerie offers a gorgeous setting, but the last meal I 
had there was so disappointing -- amateur service, high prices and food that 
was little more than bistro cooking." I have, to date, never had a bad meal or 
bad service at the restaurant.

PRIVATE LIVES: SHALL WE TRANCE?; 
</P>
<P>
IT'S NOT EASY TO MAKE IT AS A MEDIUM, EVEN IF THE SPIRIT IS WILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARGO KAUFMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WHENEVER I THINK that my job is tough, I get this little reminder from the 
Universe that it could be worse. 
</P>
<P>
As I confessed in a previous column, I have a weakness for the supernatural. 
Perhaps it's just part of being a free-lance writer, but I'm continually drawn 
to metaphysically fit folks who have mysterious ways of knowing where my next 
assignment is coming from. And they keep telling me that being a swami is no 
bed of roses. 
</P>
<P>
Take Thomas Jacobson of Beverlywood, a genial 
ex-Marine-turned-successful-trance-medium. He and "Dr. Peebles," his spirit 
compadre, have appeared on national television and radio and are the subject of 
a new book, "To Dance With Angels." 
</P>
<P>
Still, "people are constantly accusing me of fraud," Jacobson says. "Or, at 
best, of being a well-intentioned, deluded person." 
</P>
<P>
I can sympathize. It's bad enough going to parties and telling people I'm a 
free-lance writer, which everyone's job-status converter instantly translates 
into "failed real estate agent." But at least I can drop the names of 
publications, such as this one, for validation. 
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning, I told people I was in alternative communications," Jacobson 
says. "Finally, I got up the courage to tell people I'm a spiritual medium." 
That must be some icebreaker at a party. "The reaction is never boring," he 
acknowledges. "Either they have to go to the bathroom all of a sudden or they 
want to talk all evening." 
</P>
<P>
Mystics are also besieged by curiosity-seekers. "You have to let people know 
that you're out having a good time, just like everybody else," says Louise 
Woods, a Santa Monica seer who identifies herself as a metaphysical counselor. 
"People say, 'Oh, you're psychic. Tell me about this and this.' " She handles 
it the way a doctor or a lawyer would. "I give them my business card and tell 
them to make an appointment," says Woods. "I don't do house calls." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of houses . . . "Imagine me trying to get a loan on a home," says 
Jacobson, who listed "voice medium" as his occupation on both his loan 
application and his tax forms. (Can he claim Dr. Peebles as a dependent? I 
wonder.) "It's tough," he says. "You're trying to be credible, but you're doing 
something that most people see as incredible." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, I don't think what he does is any more incredible than the theory of 
continental drift. But you can't go by me. In my profession, I have to make 
numerous leaps of faith. For example, I work on spec. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a real quandary with business," Jacobson says. "On the one hand, 
there's this attitude: If you're so psychic, why don't you make money? But on 
the other hand, if you make a lot of money, you're not considered to be very 
spiritual." 
</P>
<P>
No matter what you earn, authorities will view you with suspicion. "When I 
first started working, I called downtown and asked what statutes were on the 
books," says Fern, a Los Angeles astrologer. "They said, 'You have the wrong 
office. You need to talk to the Vice Squad.' So I called. They answered the 
phone with 'Bunco.' I inquired about getting a business license, and they 
sneered, 'What exactly do you do, lady?' " 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Bunco could use someone like Fern. "I'd been reading for a very nice 
woman who worked at a bank," she recalls. "And I'd given her some dates for 
little things. Then one day she came in and said, 'Oh, Fern, these dates have 
worked out real well. Now I want you to do something important. I want you to 
pick out a good time for me to do some embezzling.' I said, "Number one, your 
chart doesn't look good for that and, number two, I don't do that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Gee, and I thought it was frustrating sitting alone in a room for hours, 
staring at a word processor. At least I don't have to divine where and when my 
editor will meet a tall, dark, handsome stranger or hold myself up to public 
ridicule when my predictions are printed in the National Enquirer. No one 
expects miracles from writers, only words. 
</P>
<P>
But some days they don't come easy -- to me anyway. Of course, I haven't taken 
any courses in mediumship like Molli Nickell. "I learned automatic writing," 
says Nickell, editor-publisher of Spirit Speaks, an all-ghost-written 
Brentwood-based magazine created to share guidance and wisdom from the spirit 
plane. "I shift into a meditative state and say a little prayer and ask my 
spirit teachers for guidance and words come into my head and I just write." 
</P>
<P>
Right. I'm sitting in front of my computer with my eyes closed. I've said a 
little prayer and begged my spirit guides to help me finish this column. That 
was an hour ago. And this piece is due by the end of the day. Suddenly, I get a 
message. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't work on deadline," the spirits say.

<TEXT>
<P>
It's time to celebrate Independence Day and, not coincidentally, the second Los 
Angeles Times Magazine fiction issue. We have collected five new stories from 
western writers that will transport you on horseback to Culver City, put you 
through grad school at Stanford, admit you to a magic show on the Kern River, 
effect your escape from Seguin, Tex., or teach you the scientific name of the 
housefly. So light the sparklers, slice the watermelon and put on your reading 
sunglasses. Happy Fourth! 
</P>
<P>
MAX SCHOTT 
</P>
<P>
"Writing," Max Schott says, "is a way of thinking about my own past." In fact, 
the characters and events in "Shannon" (Page 18) are autobiographical: There 
was a stable owner who was like a second father to Schott when he was growing 
up in Culver City; there was a girl who died trick riding and another who 
fibbed her way into the stable where he worked. "The story was inspired by 
memories, but I was also fascinated by ideas of independence in rodeo girls. 
They simply wouldn't be imposed on by anyone. They fascinated me as a kind of 
ideal." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the cast of "Shannon" is also the cast of Schott's latest novel, "Ben," 
published last month by North Point Press. Schott, a horse trainer and rodeo 
roper till he was 30, is 55 and a professor of writing and literature at UC 
Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
SANDRA CISNEROS 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Cisneros, 35, a Chicago-born Texan, calls herself a "migrant professor." 
She has taught for the past few years on three California campuses -- most 
recently at UC Irvine. Her story, "Woman Hollering Creek" (Page 14), is all 
about reality: "The soap operas are real," she says, "the people are real; the 
character Cleofilas is based on a woman I encountered, helped escape from an 
abusive husband. And a creek by the name Woman Hollering really does exist in 
Texas. When I passed over it, I gave a hoot." 
</P>
<P>
Cisneros' collection of short stories, "The House on Mango Street," won the 
Before Columbus Book Award in 1985; "Woman Hollering Creek" will appear in a 
new collection due from Random House in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
ETHAN CANIN 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what writers say, most stories are about ourselves," says Ethan 
Canin. "The facts might change a little, but not much." Canin, 29, lives in San 
Francisco, but he grew up in Pennsylvania and small-town Ohio, a self-confessed 
"sort of semi-nerd." He majored in English at Stanford and left Harvard Medical 
School one month away from obtaining an MD. 
</P>
<P>
His story, "The Scientific Method" (Page 10), is excerpted from a 
novel-in-progress that will be published next year by Houghton Mifflin. It 
expands on the story "American Beauty," which appeared in Canin's best-selling 
collection, "Emperor of the Air," in 1988. This fall, Canin will teach writing 
at the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
ALICE ADAMS 
</P>
<P>
"The Easterners" (Page 24) is just a few months out of Alice Adams' typewriter. 
Since 1966, she has published six novels ("Superior Women," in 1985, was a 
bestseller), four short-story collections and many individual pieces. She began 
by writing "awfully bad" poetry but gave it up in college. It wasn't until she 
was 40 that her first novel was published. 
</P>
<P>
"The Easterners," Adams says, contains a theme that especially interests her: 
"the myth of the evil Easterner and the good Westerner." 
</P>
<P>
Adams lives in San Francisco; her latest novel, "The Last Lovely City," will be 
released next spring by Knopf. 
</P>
<P>
GERALD HASLAM 
</P>
<P>
"Quintessentially Californian" is the way Gerald Haslam's dozens of Central 
Valley essays and short stories are usually described. "Writing about rural 
California," Haslam says, "has been to my advantage. Outsiders think we all 
roller skate to hot tubs, but we also work in the oil fields. I get a lot of 
creative energy from that tension." 
</P>
<P>
Haslam, 53, teaches English at Sonoma State University. "Upstream" (Page 30) is 
taken from "That Constant Coyote," published last month by the University of 
Nevada Press. 
</P>
<P>
"What does 'Upstream' mean? I honestly don't know," he says. "It's a tall tale, 
about primordial escape, I guess. Who knows where such a story comes from?"

Being a native Floridian with Cuban heritage, I almost died the first few

Culver City. It's unpresentable and tacky, but the authenticity is 100%. Even 
the bread is authentic.

And Emerald Restaurant on Venice for Thai/Chinese. Forget the Chinese and go 
for the fabulous soups, especially hot and spicy soup with chicken and shrimp. 
Great chicken curry, pad Thai noodles, et cetera.

After I tried a burger and fries at Meaty Meat Burgers, I became convinced that 
Reichl must have been hallucinating when she decided to recommend it.

A lousy $4 meal is not the end of the world, but it does cause me to look with 
suspicion on her other suggestions.

TRACY'S VILLAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recently, I was the unfortunate witness to a travesty of American entertainment 
that is guaranteed to affect the youth of the United States for years to come. 
The travesty was "Dick Tracy," that wonderful exploitation film by Warren 
Beatty. 
</P>
<P>
Now I'm certain that Beatty's overall purpose in the film was to capture the 
essence of the comic strip. That it did, but in doing so he overstepped the 
bounds of taste and common sense. The look of the villains (e.g., Big Boy 
Caprice, Flattop, Pruneface, Little Face, etc.) was great in that it really 
helped to separate the "bad guys" from the "good guys." Did it ever occur to 
anyone involved with the production that this separation is actually based more 
in real life than in fantasy? 
</P>
<P>
What is this film teaching America's youth? That physically deformed people are 
essentially evil, while at the same time you can be "good" only if you are 
normal? Considering the lack of sensitivity in all children of impressionable 
ages, I pity any deformed person that those children might run into. Will the 
children run screaming, or will they behave properly and treat the disfigured 
person with respect? 
</P>
<P>
I sincerely hope for the latter, yet with "Dick Tracy" running around torturing 
and killing the disfigured "bad guys," who knows?

HORMONE UNBOUNDED

<TEXT>
<P>
After reading Peter Rainer's June 24 article on movie violence and viewing the 
summer lineup of films (all male-in-dire-jeopardy plots), I figured maybe a 
good title for the whole mess would be "Testosterone Wars," because I suspect a 
large amount of this hormone has been dumped into Hollywood's reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
I wondered, where are all the blockbusters about women (who are not whores or 
psychos)? 
</P>
<P>
Then it came to me, BANG! like a slow-motion, blood-spurting head shot:

Rainer is so right about Hollywood's nonsensical misreading of Joseph

This virus of the Lucas/Spielberg strain escaped from USC in the early '80s and

When I was a "development person" and traveled extensively in that crowd, I was 
constantly amazed at the way my cohorts would justify the most worthless,

The problem with a lot of the people in the industry is that they know a lot

RATING THE SYSTEM'S DANGERS; 
</P>
<P>
DROPPING THE X 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Charles Champlin's commentary "Dropping the X," June 17: 
</P>
<P>
Champlin is right about one thing: The X rating, like communism, is an idea 
whose time has long since gone. But the blame for the de facto censorship it 
has represented for the past decade does not rest entirely with its capricious 
and inconsistent application by the Motion Picture Assn. of America but also 
with the nervous-nellie theater chains who unilaterally bar all X-rated films 
from their venues. 
</P>
<P>
About the time that "9 1/2 Weeks" and "Angel Heart" were having their ratings 
difficulties, instead of forcing the directors to monkey around with their 
vision, the studios should have pressured the theater chains to drop that 
guideline. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of that rule was to keep porno films out of the local multiplex, 
but face facts: The producers of these films know the local mall is hardly the 
place to find their target audience. The porno market has been swallowed up 
almost completely by home video. Any film made by a respectable producer or 
distributed by a major company is not likely to fit under the heading of 
hard-core smut. For that matter, almost anything shot on film (rather than 
videotape) is probably not porno. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, we still should eliminate the X, with all its less than savory 
associations (not the pornography, but the cloud of latent censorship it 
generated). Whether you replace it with an A, a 17 or an NC makes no difference 
-- just as long as the MPAA copyrights it and keeps it under association 
control. If it had done that in the first place, perhaps the whole mess could 
have been avoided.

MORE DISILLUSIONMENT OVER POLITICIANS' ANTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading about Sen. Dennis DeConcini's battle against the National Rifle 
Assn. ("Not Outgunned Yet," June 20), I found myself wondering how many times 
is it possible to be disillusioned about the way the American government works. 
</P>
<P>
I had hoped there were still politicians who lobbied or voted for a bill 
because they believed it was a good issue or important to their constituents. 
Instead, it seems the main factor is whether someone will vote for your bills 
if you've voted for one of theirs or gone to enough social events with them. 
</P>
<P>
DeConcini wasn't sure what he could do for Sen. John Warner that would persuade 
him to vote for his bill and seemed happily surprised that despite the fact 
that there was "nothing there" (how about a very necessary piece of 
legislation?), Sen. Lloyd Bentsen stood by him thanks to his "guts."

Is Washington nothing but millionaire personalities back-scratching each other?

'WORD WARRIORS' SHOULD CAP POISON PENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The point of Edward Iwata's article describing the feud between Asian-American 
writers Maxine Hong Kingston and Frank Chin ("Word Warriors," June 24) was 
well-taken. It struck me as a fitting parallel to the overwhelming alienation 
that dominates the power struggle between the sexes in our society today. 
</P>
<P>
As a writer, I can appreciate the courage and dedication both authors share to 
commit their visions to paper. Both have been willing to face and rename the 
ghosts and demons of their Chinese souls. They may not be soul mates or even 
approximate the male-female polarity and relationship that Henry Miller and 
Anais Nin had in their day, but they do have a strong basis for mutual support 
and respect. Their intentions -- to examine and expand the integrity of their 
culture -- appear to be carved from the same piece of marble, but their styles 
differ, something that seems to be less and less tolerated today due to the 
growth of hypercritical and hate-driven standards. 
</P>
<P>
We're learning that something backfired in the feminist movement. The 
shattering of the old myths has not brought about a new vision shared between 
men and women as expected. We women assumed men would cheer us on (at least 
eventually). Yet the outcome seems to be that men feel abandoned and women feel 
unsupported. 
</P>
<P>
If it's true that Chin's acknowledgment or befriending of Kingston would 
"betray his life's work, the justification of his rage," and that Kingston 
"might tarnish her (feminist mother) image if she publicly admitted Chin helped 
shape her writing," then I feel terribly despairing. If these powerful, 
literary pioneers can't take the next step toward facing each other's demons, 
then perhaps the very souls of all races are doomed to shrivel.

'WORD WARRIORS' SHOULD CAP POISON PENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am sad to learn about the warfare between these two Asian-American literary 
giants. Ever since they immigrated to America, Asians have not had an equal 
footing with whites. 
</P>
<P>
This situation is even more pronounced in the literary world. 
</P>
<P>
Since Frank Chin and Maxine Hong Kingston have achieved success and have won 
acceptance (as writers), they ought to act as role models for the young 
Asian-Americans and encourage them to pursue a career in this less popular 
field among Asians. It is unhealthy for Chin and Kingston to continue 
bickering. I would like to be the matchmaker between the dragon and the 
phoenix, so that they may come down from heaven "to make the pearl together, to 
make it perfect."

PALLONE SCORED A HIT WITH HIS COURAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for the story on former major league umpire Dave Pallone, who has 
written a book about his life in baseball as a closeted gay man. 
</P>
<P>
Pallone's story dramatizes the pain all of us who are lesbian and gay 
experience when we are forced to hide our identities to avoid discrimination 
and bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
Professional baseball, like other American institutions, needs to wake up to 
the fact that lesbians and gay men are active in all walks of life, including 
major league sports. 
</P>
<P>
A person's sexual orientation is an integral part of who that person is, and 
discrimination based on that orientation is just as immoral as racism and other 
forms of bigotry. For people like Pallone to have to hide a basic part of their 
identity to do the work they love is a tragedy, benefiting no one.

SIMPLE DO-IT-YOURSELF FIXES CAN MAKE HOME 'WATERTIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY ABRAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Southern California is facing one of the worst droughts in decades. 
</P>
<P>
As the Los Angeles City Council and officials of other Southland communities 
move closer to mandating cutbacks in household water consumption, all of us 
should be thinking about ways to conserve water around the house. 
</P>
<P>
While much water can be saved by simple common-sense changes in personal habits 
such as not hosing driveways and turning off the water while shaving, there are 
several do-it-yourself conservation and repair techniques that can further 
reduce water use in the home. 
</P>
<P>
According to Maureen Erbeznik, conservation specialist for the city of Santa 
Monica, "Showering is one of the largest residential water usages. Installation 
of low-flow shower heads or flow restrictors can reduce shower water 
consumption by 50% or more. 
</P>
<P>
"Most normal shower heads supply 6 to 8 gallons of water per minute, while 
low-flow or restricted heads allow less than 3 gallons per minute." 
</P>
<P>
Most hardware stores sell low-flow shower heads, which also come with an 
instant-off button for soaping up, or plastic flow restrictor discs that fit 
into your existing head. Some cities supply these items free of charge to 
residents. Check with your City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing your shower head or installing a flow restrictor requires an 8-inch 
adjustable wrench or large pair of pliers. If you use pliers, wrap the jaws 
with a couple layers of plastic tape to protect the finish on the shower head. 
</P>
<P>
You will notice either two flat areas on opposite sides of the shower head 
"neck" where it joins the pipe from the wall, or a knurled collar around the 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
Adjust the wrench or pliers to fit snugly over the neck and turn the tool 
counter-clockwise to loosen the shower head. Continue unscrewing the head by 
hand until it comes off. 
</P>
<P>
Before reattaching either a new low-flow shower head or the old shower head 
with a flow restrictor placed into the threaded recessed area of the neck, 
first seal the threads to prevent leakage. 
</P>
<P>
Moisten an ordinary bar of soap and rub it over all the threads visible at the 
end of the pipe projecting from the wall so that all the spaces between the 
threads are covered with a layer of soap. Then screw the head on as tightly as 
possible by hand and continue tightening with the wrench or pliers until it 
feels snug. 
</P>
<P>
Turn on the water and check for leaks. If water drips from the head/pipe joint, 
further tighten the shower head. 
</P>
<P>
Odds are that initially you will not like the diminished water pressure from 
the low-flow head. 
</P>
<P>
Stick with it, though. Both the water savings and sewer flow reduction are 
quite substantial, and you will get used to it sooner than you think. 
</P>
<P>
Most of us have heard of the idea of saving lots of water by placing a "tank 
dam" or plastic bottle inside a toilet tank (up to 22 gallons a day), but not 
many people realize that a toilet that leaks can waste up to 400 gallons of 
water a month! 
</P>
<P>
Determining if your toilet leaks sometimes requires a careful listening and 
close observation. 
</P>
<P>
Close the bathroom door to block outside sound and listen to your toilet. A 
slight hissing sound from the toilet usually means a leak. 
</P>
<P>
To diagnose the source of the leak, place five to 10 drops of food coloring 
into the tank after it fills up and observe the water in the bowl. If the drain 
ball or flapper at the bottom of the tank is worn, the water in the bowl will 
begin to change to the color of the tank water. 
</P>
<P>
To replace the drain ball, first shut off the water by turning the supply valve 
under the left side of the toilet tank clockwise fully. 
</P>
<P>
Then hold the brass rod the drain ball is attached to with a pair of pliers 
while unscrewing the ball with the other hand. Wear a glove. 
</P>
<P>
To replace a drain flapper, just unhook it from either side of the overflow 
tube and pull it out. Also unhook the chain that goes to the flush handle 
lever. 
</P>
<P>
Any hardware store will have these replacement parts. 
</P>
<P>
When installing either the drain ball or flapper, lightly coat the bottom 
surface with Vaseline to create a better seal. 
</P>
<P>
If the food coloring test proves negative, the problem could be that the 
control valve is worn and is allowing so much water into the tank that it is 
spilling into the "overflow tube" that rises in the middle of the tank. 
</P>
<P>
The cure for this is usually bending the float ball rod so the ball sits lower 
in the tank. Grasp the rod with two hands and gradually increase downward 
pressure with your right hand until the rod bends down 1 to 2 inches on the 
right. Test the water level to assure it does not enter the tube again. Adjust 
if needed. 
</P>
<P>
Most manufacturers recommend a water level about 1 inch below the top of the 
overflow tube. However, most toilets work just fine with a lower level in the 
tank, thereby saving water. 
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, bend the rod further, so that the level in the tank is 2, 3 
or more inches below the top of the tube. Adjust your own level so the toilet 
flushes properly with as little water as possible. 
</P>
<P>
As with reducing shower water volume, reducing toilet water use saves hundreds 
of gallons per month in most households while reducing impact on our sewage 
treatment facilities. 
</P>
<P>
If you have checked for tank leaks and cured any problems with the control 
valve but still hear a hissing sound, check the float ball in the tank. 
Sometimes the ball will fill with enough water that it does not float high 
enough to fully shut the valve. 
</P>
<P>
To check the ball, unscrew it from the brass rod and shake it. Replace it if 
you hear any water at all. 
</P>
<P>
If you have the type of toilet that requires a jiggle of the flush handle to 
stop it from running after use, you may be able to fix it yourself by first 
observing the action of the drain ball or flapper when the tank is flushed. 
</P>
<P>
If your tank has a drain ball that fails to drop onto its seat without a shake 
of the flush handle, the problem could be that the thin brass rod it is 
attached to is binding in its brackets. 
</P>
<P>
To correct this, clean any rust or corrosion off the rod with steel wool and 
lubricate it with Vaseline. 
</P>
<P>
Drain flappers that fail to close again fully after flushing usually have a 
snagged link in the chain between the drain flapper and the flush lever. If you 
notice this problem, replace the flapper chain with one that has smooth, round 
closed links, rather than twisted wire links, and make sure that the chain is 
adjusted so there is only one-half inch of slack when the flapper is seated on 
the tank bottom. 
</P>
<P>
If, after checking for all these items the toilet is still running, the problem 
may be a defective control valve or drain valve, which will usually require 
professional help. Try these suggestions first, because more than half the time 
the problem can be easily fixed in a few minutes with less than $10 of readily 
available replacement parts. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, keep the water supply valve under the left side of the tank 
shut except to refill the tank after use to reduce water waste while awaiting 
help. 
</P>
<P>
As with a toilet that leaks or runs, a constantly dripping faucet can also 
waste hundreds of gallons of water a month. 
</P>
<P>
There is a large array of faucets types and styles in residential use, but the 
most common and most easily repaired is a washer-type faucet. 
</P>
<P>
To repair these faucets, start by shutting the water main valve to the house 
or, if they exist, shutting the supply valves under the sink. 
</P>
<P>
Turn the faucet handle so it is somewhere between the "off" and "on" position. 
Remove the faucet handle and the plate at the base of the stem to expose the 
hexagonal wrench pad on the valve stem underneath. Place a wrench on the pad 
and turn it counter-clockwise to loosen it. 
</P>
<P>
Once loose, the valve stem will come out easily by hand. At the end of the stem 
is a black rubber washer, held in place with a screw. 
</P>
<P>
Place the faucet handle back on the end of the stem to hold it while you remove 
the screw and the old washer. From any hardware store buy a faucet repair kit 
and look for a replacement washer of similar size to the old one. 
</P>
<P>
Replace the stem back into the valve body, making sure that it is still 
oriented between "off" and "on." Retighten it snugly, replace the plate and the 
handle. 
</P>
<P>
Before turning the water back on, unscrew the aerator at the end of the spout 
to prevent debris loosened in the shut-off valve from lodging in the aerator 
filter screens. Turn on the water, let it run until clear and replace the 
aerator. 
</P>
<P>
Follow these same procedures to fix leaky hose bib faucets and sprinkler 
valves. Sprinkler valves require oversize washers that most hardware stores 
carry. 
</P>
<P>
Another way to reduce water waste from faucets is to simply close the shut-off 
valves under the sink a turn or so clockwise to reduce the water flow to the 
faucet by about half. According to the Santa Monica Department of General 
Services, this can save up to 126 gallons per week for the average household. 
</P>
<P>
According to Los Angeles Department of Water and Power studies, most of us tend 
to water too often and leave the sprinklers on too long. They recommend 
watering only every third day, and during early morning or evening hours to 
reduce evaporation. 
</P>
<P>
Water savings for the typical home can be up to 500 gallons a week with this 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
But even if you follow this recommendation, you may be wasting water by 
overspray, puddling or improperly aimed heads. Here is advice for solving these 
common sprinkler problems. 
</P>
<P>
Overspray onto sidewalks or onto the house is not only wasteful but can lead to 
costly moisture damage to the paint, stucco and structural members of the 
building. To correct it, turn the brass screw in to center of the sprinkler 
head clockwise until the desired spray volume is reached. 
</P>
<P>
Puddling around the sprinkler head is usually caused by nothing more than 
deflection of the spray by tall grass around the head. Always keep at least an 
8-inch diameter circle of very low cut grass around each head to allow the 
spray to clear. 
</P>
<P>
Correcting improperly aimed sprinklers is very easy. With a large pair of 
pliers or a sprinkler wrench (about $5 at most hardware stores), gently turn 
the entire head so that the spray is directed to the desired area. 
</P>
<P>
If the spray pattern itself is incorrect, the "insert" in the center of the 
head can be replaced to more suitably match the area to be watered. 
</P>
<P>
They are sold to spray one-eighth-, one-quarter-, one-half-, three-quarter- or 
full-circle patterns. Remove your existing insert and take it to most any 
hardware store to find one of the appropriate pattern. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have all your sprinklers operating at peak efficiency, continue 
checking them about once every month or two. Sediment and debris in the pipes 
often causes clogs in the heads, which adversely affect the spray quality. 
</P>
<P>
LOW-FLOW SHOWER HEAD

Before reattaching new shower head, rub wet soap on the threads at the end of

Multibillionaire BILL GATES, co-founder and chairman of Microsoft Corp., one of 
the nation's most successful computer software companies, plans to build a 
45,800-square-foot home in the Seattle suburb of Medina, and 80% of the project 
will be underground. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to build something of a scale to fit the surroundings and sort of 
low-key," said Bob Burke, planning consultant to the city of Medina, "but it 
won't be totally buried. He'll be able to look out at the lake." The home will 
have 400 feet of waterfront on Lake Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 35,800-square-foot main house will be built into a steep hillside. 
The remaining 10,000 square feet will be used for a caretaker's house, a 
lakeside pavilion with a hot tub and barbecue, and an underground garage to 
house at least 20 cars. 
</P>
<P>
Three kitchens, a television/theater room and a swimming pool will be among the 
subterranean features. Plans also call for a sports court for racquetball and 
volleyball; a 100-foot, two-slip dock, and an artificial estuary and creek 
circling the house and running down to the lake. 
</P>
<P>
Work on the caretaker's cottage, the garage and a road into the 4.5-acre site 
is scheduled to begin this fall. "The big house will be under way after the 
rains, next spring," Burke said. The home will take at least two years and an 
estimated $5 million to $10 million to build. 
</P>
<P>
Gates, a 34-year-old bachelor, now lives in Seattle's Laurelhurst neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
On the scale of big houses, Gates' home rates behind producer Aaron Spelling's, 
whose nearly completed Holmby Hills residence will be 56,500 square feet; a 
112,895-square-foot mansion in Cold Springs Hill, New York; the 
125,000-square-foot Pullman estate in Hillsboro, Calif.; and the 
126,000-square-foot Biltmore House in Asheville, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
The world's largest privately owned single-family residence is said to be the 
231,000-square-foot, West German mansion owned by Prince Johannes Thurn und 
Taxis. 
</P>
<P>
Tony Award-winning lyricist/composer JERRY HERMAN ("Hello, Dolly!," "La Cage 
aux Folles," "Mame") has purchased a home in Los Angeles after about a 10-year 
absence from the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm coming back; I'm so excited," he said by phone from his Manhattan 
townhouse. "I've very much missed all my friends in the Los Angeles area. I 
always had my major home in New York, but I had a second home in L.A. all 
through the '70s." 
</P>
<P>
Herman, who will continue to maintain his townhouse in Manhattan and a country 
home in Upstate New York, bought a place above Sunset Strip for slightly more 
than $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
The seller was John Bourne, an artist and collector of pre-Columbian art who 
just acquired actor Gene Hackman's home in Santa Fe, N.M., for $1.9 million in 
cash, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
Bourne owned the house above Sunset Strip almost from the time it was built in 
1966. Herman knew of the home because he had bought, remodeled and sold three 
or four houses in the area. 
</P>
<P>
He left Los Angeles in the early 1980s for the Florida Keys, where he also 
refurbished several homes. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a background in design and architecture, and between shows, I buy old 
houses and redo and sell them," he said. "It's a wonderful hobby and great 
therapy, but I'm glad I was able to get this (home above Sunset Strip), because 
it is a house I've had a great love for." 
</P>
<P>
A friend told him that Bourne finally put it on the market, and Herman hurried 
to buy it. "It was designed by Ted Grenzbach, one of my favorite architects," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The 3,500-square-foot house was designed in the shape of an H, with a glass 
crosswalk from part of the house to the other. Half of the two-bedroom house is 
the master bedroom suite. 
</P>
<P>
The home sits on a knoll with a 180-degree view from downtown to the ocean; a 
fountain and a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Kyle with Mimi Styne Associates, a Joyce Blumberg Co., handled both sides 
of the transaction. Kyle, a former dancer, has known Herman since 1964 when 
appearing on Broadway in the chorus of "Hello, Dolly!" starring Carol Channing. 
</P>
<P>
PIA ZADORA, who goes on tour with Frank Sinatra and Don Rickles starting Aug. 
17 in Sacramento, and her businessman husband, MESHULAM RIKLIS, have sold one 
of their three Beverly Hills-area homes. 
</P>
<P>
The home, built in 1958, was owned, about 10 years ago, by former jockey Bill 
Shoemaker. It was bought by an Italian industrialist for $4.7 million, 
according to public records. The 6,370-square-foot contemporary, on one acre 
with five bedrooms and 6 1/2 baths, had been listed with Mike Silverman of 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Zadora and Riklis also own the legendary Pickfair, which they practically razed 
and are rebuilding, as well as homes in Beverly Park, in the Beverly Hills Post 
Office area, Malibu and Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
MAURICE L. KUSELL, former choreographer/writer/director of stage and screen 
musicals, and his wife, Linda, have completed a home near Pismo Beach and have 
put their Los Feliz home on the market at $1,075,000. 
</P>
<P>
Their $1-million beach home, in Arroyo Grande, has four bedrooms, four baths 
and an artist's studio in 3,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
"We both oil paint," he said. "I gave up choreography quite awhile ago. . . . 
Choreography is for much younger people," said Kusell, who is 88. 
</P>
<P>
Kusell said he worked the films "Puttin' on the Ritz" in 1930, starring Joan 
Bennett; "Reaching for the Moon" in 1931, starring Douglas Fairbanks Sr., and 
"The Great Gabbo" in 1929, starring Erich Von Stroheim, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Their new home is on an acre of rolling hills overlooking the ocean. Their 
daughter, Maurine Kusell Zigelman, a dental surgeon, and her internist husband, 
Dr. Michael Zigelman, built a house for themselves on an abutting acre, he 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
Kusell's Los Feliz home is listed with Lucy Kominih of the Jon Douglas Co.

INTERSTATE TOWER: ART OF THE DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHITECTURE: DEAL MAKING IS THE PRIMARY ART FORM EXPRESSED IN THE WEST COAST'S 
TALLEST BUILDING. IT WAS SHAPED BY A TANGLE OF AGREEMENTS THAT PUT ELEGANCE AT 
A DISTANCE.

<P>
Looking north up Hope Street, you can see a radical change in the skyline of 
downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
One of Los Angeles' major urban vistas, once crowned by the charming tower and 
tiled pyramid of Bertram Goodhue's 1920s Central Library, is now dominated by 
the slim white cylinder of the 73-story First Interstate World Center. 
</P>
<P>
Now the tallest building on the West Coast, the 1,017-foot First Interstate 
tower looms over the Central Library, which is now undergoing a $150-million 
renovation and expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by a team of New York City architects -- Pei, Cobb, Freed &amp; 
Partners in association with Harold Fredenburgh -- the tower stands out on the 
downtown skyline as a graceful beacon visible for miles, marking the center of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
From close up, however, the tower is less elegant than it seems from a 
distance. The soaring shaft's faceted circular volume, narrowing toward the 
top, is too blandly detailed to hold the viewer's interest. 
</P>
<P>
And a sharp drop in level between Hope and 5th streets at the tower's base, 
marked by an outdoor grand stairway, adds to the feeling that the 
1.3-million-square-foot building, squeezed onto a small site, is a little too 
big for its boots. 
</P>
<P>
The building's developer, Maguire Thomas Partners, believes that the 
distinctive white tower is Los Angeles' "signature" skyscraper, the city's 
architectural climax. But the building is an act of architecture only 
secondarily. 
</P>
<P>
The primary art form expressed in the shape and character of the First 
Interstate World Center is not architecture, but a dizzying, seven-year 
exercise in deal making. 
</P>
<P>
The complex deals and trade-offs that made the tower possible limited the size 
of its site, added 20 floors to its height and determined the upper-level 
setbacks, which shaped its silhouette. 
</P>
<P>
After this, the architects' options were confined to finessing the tower's 
profile, detailing its skin and attempting to design a humanely scaled 
street-level presence for the massive shaft. 
</P>
<P>
This situation is analogous to having a painting's size, shape and composition 
negotiated by art dealers, then hiring an artist to fill in the colors and 
elaborate the picture frame. 
</P>
<P>
The artful deal making made concrete in the First Interstate tower was founded 
on a brilliant scheme to help pay for the Central Library's ambitious 
renovation and expansion without -- at that time -- spending a penny of public 
money. 
</P>
<P>
The plan involved an agreement by the city to sell the potential development 
rights presumed to exist in the air over the library to Maguire Thomas 
Partners. 
</P>
<P>
Shunted across 5th Street, this chunk of unbuilt air added the 20 extra stories 
to the height the First Interstate tower would normally have been permitted 
under current downtown zoning laws. 
</P>
<P>
To finesse the deal, Maguire Thomas Partners then sold half the building's 
equity to Pacific Enterprises and negotiated a further agreement with the 
Community Redevelopment Agency to build another 52-story office high-rise on 
5th Street across Grand Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
This is a bare-bones outline of a financial and political process that involved 
numerous city agencies and elected officials, First Interstate Bank, the major 
law firm of Latham &amp; Watkins, broker and developer John C. Cushman III and 
a host of other players. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Enterprises President James R. Ukropina is reported to have said in a 
moment of exhaustion that the complex wheeling and dealing "pushed people to 
the edge of insanity." 
</P>
<P>
But developer Robert F. Maguire III views the process differently. He says the 
extra height added to the First Interstate tower was simply the result of a 
need to raise extra funds for the ever-increasing expense of the Central 
Library's expansion and renovation. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, we had envisioned no more than a 50-story building," Maguire said. 
"However, as the CRA and library staff plans for the library grew, costs went 
up." 
</P>
<P>
The library's budget increased so much, Maguire said, that the CRA proposed 
that he build the second building across Grand Avenue to provide additional 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
"We were never comfortable with having the tallest building in the city," 
Maguire insisted. "We are emphatically opposed to that kind of symbolism -- it 
is not in our culture." 
</P>
<P>
But now that the 73-story tower is a reality, Maguire feels it's "substantially 
superior to the earlier versions of 50 stories, that looked like a stuffed 
Polish sausage." 
</P>
<P>
After the deals were done, the architects were left to make what they could of 
the tower shape they were handed -- a challenge complicated by the awkward 
change of levels at the shaft's base. 
</P>
<P>
"Granting primacy at street level to Goodhue's great library was a major 
concern," designer Henry Cobb said. 
</P>
<P>
To emphasize this primacy, a dramatic "water garden" stairway, designed by 
noted landscape architect Lawrence Halprin, will lead pedestrians down from 
upper Hope Street to a point opposite the library's main entrance. 
</P>
<P>
This grand staircase, to be topped by a walk-in pavilion resembling a giant 
golden metal snake crafted by Frank Gehry, is intended as a "choreographed 
experience that captures the life and vitality of the city," according to 
Halprin. 
</P>
<P>
A water wall cascading over terraces and along channels running down the middle 
of the steps will form the backdrop for outdoor cafes and flower vendors. In 
this "urban theater" it is hoped that mimes and musicians will entertain 
lunchtime office workers. 
</P>
<P>
Once the configuration of the tower's base was determined, the main cylinder of 
the high-rise was designed. 
</P>
<P>
To shape the tall shaft's floor plans, and give the tower visual interest as it 
soared upward, principal designer Harold Fredenburgh played with variations of 
a circle laid over a square. 
</P>
<P>
"The aim was to enhance the tower's verticality and emphasize the skyward 
perspective," Fredenburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
The faceted circular surface that resulted from this circle-in-a-square design 
fills out the tower's lower 45 stories. Above the 45th floor the shaft narrows 
down through a series of setbacks, emerging as a pure drum shape in the top 
five floors. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate World Center is a striking obelisk when viewed from a distance 
through the windshield of a car approaching downtown along one of the freeways 
that circle the central city. But as one comes close, the detailing of the 
tower's faceted pale-gray Sardinian granite with beige accents and flush-tinted 
windows, lack sufficient subtlety to interest the eye. 
</P>
<P>
Seen from below, the shaft's complex geometries are hard to decipher. And its 
horizontal banding seems at odds with Fredenburgh's aim to enhance a vertical 
character. 
</P>
<P>
The main lobby off 5th Street opposite the library is confusing. The tower's 
columns, sheathed in illuminated glass cases, block the front doors. The 
lobby's connection to the Hope Street entry four floors above is poorly thought 
out, and the auto drop-off for visitors seems like an afterthought slotted in 
at the back of the building. 
</P>
<P>
Not even the vast and vivid lobby mural commissioned from artist David Hockney 
will succeed in giving the space a visual coherence. 
</P>
<P>
In the tower's interior the eccentric floor plans generated by the 
squared-circle shape allow offices of a variety of configurations, from wedges 
to octagons. 
</P>
<P>
The relative smallness of the floors compared to most modern office high-rises 
guarantees that few workers are far from a window. The top five circular levels 
offer panoramic views -- on smogless days -- from the San Gabriel Mountains to 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Structurally, the tower is designed to withstand an 8.3 earthquake -- Los 
Angeles' "Big One," predicted to strike within the next 30 years. The tower's 
massively reinforced central core and lighter perimeter columns form a 
framework flexible enough to resist violent side-to-side shaking, the 
architects and engineers believe. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back over the blood, sweat and tears of the past seven years, developer 
Nelson Rising of Maguire Thomas Partners declares that he is "thrilled with 
this beautiful building." 
</P>
<P>
The venture has been, Rising said, "profitable and significant for Los Angeles 
in the creation of a signature tower for the city." 
</P>
<P>
If the First Interstate tower is indeed our urban signature, it can only be 
said that our identity is smudged. 
</P>
<P>
Given that the art was in the deal not the architecture, the First Interstate 
World Center could still have been the landmark that crowned Bunker Hill and 
redeemed the architectural mediocrity of most of our downtown towers. 
</P>
<P>
It could have been our equivalent of Manhattan's Chrysler Building, with a 
superb profile silhouetted against the sky and urbane proportions detailed to 
delight the eye from near and far. 
</P>
<P>
But the tower's designers and their patrons haven't quite risen to the 
occasion. They haven't come together to create a tower whose verve and grace 
might have made us forget the profits and the politics. 
</P>
<P>
A major factor in this failure is that the First Interstate World Center 
development, despite its present identification with a big bank, began its 
complex life as a speculative commercial high-rise venture, not a corporate 
headquarters meant to symbolize the pride of a major enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
What this means can be seen by comparing First Interstate with another Maguire 
Thomas Partners development on Bunker Hill -- the Wells Fargo Center, 
originally the Crocker Center. 
</P>
<P>
Wells Fargo/Crocker Center, designed as a corporate symbol, is a much more 
graceful and urbane project. The towers are planned to create a pleasant plaza 
at street level for people to sit and stroll and shop. Seen against the 
downtown skyline, the eccentrically shaped shafts make an intriguingly composed 
counterpoint. 
</P>
<P>
In this achievement the architect's role was clearly central, not peripheral. 
</P>
<P>
Here the designer was not called upon simply to do a cosmetic job on a done 
deal, but to shape the project from the start, create it from the ground up. 
This fact alone makes Wells Fargo Center a much better act of urban 
architecture than First Interstate. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that hectic horse trading, not architecture or urban design, is the 
primary interest powering many speculative commercial high-rises -- by far the 
large majority of our new towers -- explains why our proud new downtown has so 
few buildings of distinction. 
</P>
<P>
When even a respected and progressive developer like Maguire Thomas Partners 
reduces its architects to a relatively minor role in the game of 
make-me-a-city, what hope have we for an urban core that is more than a boring 
collection of built deals?

CONSUMER NOTEBOOK: IS NOW THE TIME TO REFINANCE YOUR MORTGAGE?; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCES: IF YOU CAN REDUCE THE INTEREST ON YOUR LOAN AT LEAST 2% AND REPAY 
LOST COSTS FROM REDUCED PAYMENTS WITHIN THREE YEARS, IT MAKES SENSE TO 
REFINANCE NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS, Bruss is a syndicated real estate columnist.

<TEXT>
<P>
In case you haven't been paying attention, home mortgage interest rates have 
dropped recently. Many lenders also have cut or eliminated their loan fees 
because the home mortgage business is very slow. But lenders are not rushing to 
slash their interest rates, although some economists are forecasting continued 
gradual declines in them. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the decrease in home loan interest rates, many homeowners are 
wondering if now is a good time to refinance. The reasons for refinancing 
include (1) lowering the interest rate, (2) taking out equity in the form of 
tax-free cash, (3) converting from an adjustable to a fixed rate loan, (4) 
paying off a balloon payment, and (5) cutting the monthly mortgage payment. 
</P>
<P>
If you are considering a mortgage refinance to cut your interest rate and lower 
your monthly loan payment, the general rule is that it pays to refinance if you 
can reduce the interest rate at least 2% and if you can repay lost costs from 
reduced payments within three years. This is sometimes called the 2-3 rule. 
</P>
<P>
But even if your situation doesn't meet these criteria, you may want to 
refinance anyway. For example, if your adjustable rate mortgage is over 11% and 
you can get a new fixed rate mortgage at 10%, you will probably sleep much 
better knowing your fixed interest rate cannot be raised. 
</P>
<P>
Or if you have a balloon payment coming due in a few months, today may be the 
right time to refinance. Still another good reason to refinance would be to 
take out tax-free cash, so you can buy sound, well-located investment property. 
</P>
<P>
The only valid way to evaluate fixed and adjustable rate mortgages is to 
compare their APR (annual percentage rate). Don't be lured by abnormally low 
initial teaser or sucker interest rates on adjustable loans. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in my town several lenders currently offer ARMs at teaser interest 
rates as low as 6.9% for the first six months. However, those loans will have 
APRs of 10.51% after the loan adjusts to the market interest rate in seven 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the APR for fixed and adjustable rate mortgages is around 10.5%. The 
APR includes the loan interest rate and amortized loan fees. In the past, to 
compensate for the borrower's risk of rising interest rates, the APR for 
adjustable loans was much lower than for fixed rate loans. 
</P>
<P>
Because there is virtually no difference between the APR for fixed and 
adjustable rate mortgages, today most borrowers opt for the fixed rate. 
However, borrowers who think rates might decline or who can't qualify for fixed 
rate loans will choose an adjustable rate mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
Homeowners should realize when they have a good mortgage and leave it alone. A 
prime example is a homeowner with a large, low fixed interest rate loan. If 
this is your situation, but you want to take out some tax-free cash, your best 
bet is to leave the first mortgage alone and take out a home equity second 
mortgage loan. Today most banks and S&amp;Ls are extremely eager to make more 
profitable home equity loans. 
</P>
<P>
Another situation in which refinancing usually is not advised occurs if you 
bought your home within the last few years and obtained a 90% or 95% mortgage. 
Since you will probably have to pay refinance fees out of your pocket because 
the loan-to-value ratio is so high, refinancing is not a profitable alternative 
until you have built up more equity in your home. 
</P>
<P>
If you decide to go ahead with refinancing, be aware of the typical refinancing 
costs you will encounter. However, these fees vary widely, so be sure to shop 
among at least a half-dozen lenders: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- The loan fee. Although a loan fee paid to obtain an acquisition home 
mortgage was fully deductible in the year of home purchase, when you refinance 
a home mortgage, the loan fee is not immediately deductible in full. However, 
it can be deducted over the life of the mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
Although many lenders offer home loans without fees, most charge loan fees in 
"points." One point equals 1% of the amount borrowed. To illustrate, a 2-point 
loan fee on a $100,000 mortgage is $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Mortgage insurance. If you obtain a FHA loan or a 90% or 95% PMI (private 
mortgage insurance) mortgage, you will be charged for mortgage insurance. These 
fees vary widely. Some can be added to the loan amount, whereas others must be 
paid monthly. 
</P>
<P>
If you obtain a PMI mortgage, be sure to ask the lender for a written promise 
when the PMI premium can be dropped, usually after a few years when the 
loan-to-value ratio drops below 80%. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Appraisal fee. Most lenders charge borrowers for appraisal of the 
property. If you are asked to pay the fee, perhaps around $250, be sure the 
lender agrees to give you a written copy of the appraisal. Be wary of any 
lender who refuses to give you a copy of the appraisal because the lender may 
be "low balling" you by under-estimating your home's market value. 
</P>
<P>
When you get a copy of the appraisal, check to see if you agree with the list 
of sales prices of comparable nearby homes on which your home's appraised value 
was based. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Title insurance. Most mortgage lenders require a new lender's title 
insurance policy. However, be sure to ask if you can get a discount by going 
back to the same title insurer who insured your home at the time of purchase. 
</P>
<P>
5 -- Escrow or attorney fee. There will usually be a charge made by the escrow 
firm, S&amp;L, bank, or attorney who handles the loan closing. However, these 
fees vary widely, so don't hesitate to shop around. 
</P>
<P>
6 -- Watch out for miscellaneous "garbage" fees. Lenders have become notorious 
for charging miscellaneous "garbage" fees. Legitimate fees include credit 
report, notary and recording fees. But some lenders charge outrageous fees, 
such as a $100 "document drawing fee" for typing up the loan papers, which 
takes about 10 minutes of a $10-per-hour clerk's time. If you question the 
lender's garbage fees and threaten to take your business elsewhere, you will be 
amazed how quickly the lender will waive the nuisance fees. 
</P>
<P>
Refinancing your home loan can be a profitable experience. But don't be 
intimidated by the lender. Shop carefully among many lenders to get the right 
loan terms for your situation. After all, you are the customer, and the 
customer is always right.

Czech-point: According to the National Assn. of Visa Services, U.S. travelers 
planning a trip of less than 30 days to Czechoslovakia no longer need advance 
visas. Visitors will fill out an entry form and pay a $25 fee upon arrival in 
Czechoslovakia, which has promised to try to process passengers promptly.

Soviet buildup: Intourist will build or renovate eight hotel properties in 
Moscow and Leningrad by the end of 1991. A total of 4,200 hotel beds in Moscow 
and 3,500 in Leningrad are expected to be added through the program, 
representing total room increases of 10% and 11%, respectively. The eight 
properties are part of a larger Intourist plan valued at $1.6 billion (U.S.) to 
construct and refurbish 30 hotels throughout the Soviet Union by the end of 
1991. Chief among the Moscow developments is the Radisson Slavjanskaya Hotel 
and Business Centre, a 430-room hotel and 155-suite business center being built 
at the Kiev Railway Station. Construction has been under way for several years 
and the hotel will open this fall, according to Soviet and U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union received approximately 80,000 visitors from the United States 
last year, and expects a 5% increase in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Help to come: Travelers whose package holidays go awry should, beginning in 
1993, have greater rights of redress from European Community-based tour 
operators under a directive approved by consumer affairs ministers of the 
member countries. 
</P>
<P>
But the ministers, meeting in Luxembourg recently, decided to ignore various 
amendments presented by the European Parliament and backed by the Brussels 
Commission that would have set more precise rules on compensation, tougher 
limits on last-minute price surcharges and a more specific remedy procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Karel Van Miert, the EEC commissioner responsible for both transport and 
consumer protection, said that he would closely monitor the new measure to see 
if it should be strengthened by further legislation. 
</P>
<P>
On the go: More Americans traveled in 1989 than ever before, amassing nearly 
1.26 billion person-trips, a 2% increase over 1988, according to the U.S. 
Travel Data Center. (A person-trip measures one person traveling 100 miles or 
more away from home.) 
</P>
<P>
Total travel increased for the fifth consecutive year in 1989 and has increased 
more than 23% during the five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
Vacation and weekend travel enjoyed banner years in 1989. Vacation travel 
jumped 6% to total more than 878 million person-trips, and weekend travel rose 
4% to more than 582 million person-trips. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling by automobile, truck or RV was again the most popular mode of 
transportation in 1989, increasing 3% over 1988. More than 78% of all travel 
was auto-related in 1989, while 19% was air travel. The South Atlantic 
attracted more travelers than any other census region, receiving 281 million 
person-trips last year. 
</P>
<P>
Diey new# Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., has hiked gate admissions about 
$4 and $3, for its four-day, three-park passports to $109.85 for ages 10 and 
older and $87.65 for children 3 to 9. 
</P>
<P>
On the double: The northeast Ohio community of Twinsburg will play host to some 
3,000 sets of twins Aug. 4-5 during the 15th annual Twins Days Festival. For 
the first time, a group of nine sets of twins and their escorts from Moscow 
will attend this year's festival. It is recognized as the world's largest 
annual gathering of twins, drawing pairs from around the world. For more 
information, contact the Twins Day Festival, Twinsburg, Ohio 44087, (216) 
425-3652.

<P>
Cutting your losses: The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted recently to 
recommend Senate ratification of the Montreal Protocols, a multilateral treaty 
that would improve access to compensation for losses resulting from airline 
accidents or terrorist acts. According to Travel Weekly, a supplemental 
compensation plan would offer virtually unlimited compensation, funded by a 
ticket surcharge in the $2- to $3-range.

HANNIBAL, Mo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Except for the signs and markers, one would hardly guess that this laid-back 
community provided the inspiration and story material for one of our country's 
most celebrated authors and humorists. 
</P>
<P>
Snug, smug and self-possessed, the town of Hannibal meanders along the banks of 
the Mississippi, 119 miles northwest of St. Louis and proudly lays claim to 
nurturing the boyhood of Samuel Langhorne Clemens, the indomitable Mark Twain. 
</P>
<P>
Though looked upon as a native son by the locals, Twain was actually born on 
Nov. 30, 1835 in Florida, Mo., 35 miles to the southwest. It wasn't until Twain 
was four years old that the Clemens family pulled up roots and moved to 
Hannibal. It was here, however, that he spent his youth and later regaled a 
global audience remembering his hometown in his writings about the escapades of 
Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn and Becky Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
His father, Judge John Clemens, built a small, white clapboard house at 208 
Hill in 1844 and though structurally changed, it is the same dwelling in which 
Twain spent his "Tom Sawyer" years. Even the fence that figured in the 
well-known white-washing episode still stands. 
</P>
<P>
Since many of the family's possessions were sold at auction to pay off debts, 
few of the original furnishings remained in the house. The decor was Victorian: 
itchy horsehair seated chairs, a fine drop-table, a rocker with crocheted 
headrest and the open family bible. Twain's lap-writing desk and wooden 
knife-and-fork tray were on the dining room table. 
</P>
<P>
It was from this room that Peter the cat, breathing fire, jumped out the window 
after Tom Sawyer gave him a potent dose of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs in the small, crowded boys' room, visitors saw a trundle bed and the 
window exit frequently used by a young Sam Clemens who shimmied down the 
drainpipe to reach the ground below. His parent's room, which became Aunt 
Polly's in "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer," was furnished with a handsome burled 
walnut bureau and spool crib. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the house is undergoing a major restoration and is presently covered 
with a huge plastic bubble while workmen reconstruct the house to exactly the 
way it was when the Clemens family lived there. The furniture is in storage and 
visitors will see only the shell of the house until it is rededicated in March, 
1991. All the other buildings in town are open. 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, the sterile way that visitors were able to view the house, peering 
through glass windows at the rooms, will also be improved. 
</P>
<P>
The adjoining Museum, concluded as a Works Progress Administration project in 
1937, is patterned after a 100-year-old building that stood on the site. 
Twain's gold watch and white jacket, his typewriter and fountain pen, the cap 
and gown he wore when he received an honorary degree at Oxford, and the small, 
table-like desk where he wrote "Tom Sawyer" are included in the extensive 
exhibits and memorabilia. Here, too, are copies of his books in 25 different 
languages as well as 16 Norman Rockwell paintings that were used as 
illustrations for special editions of "Tom Sawyer" and "Huckleberry Finn". 
</P>
<P>
On a busy summer day, the guest registry may show visitors from up to 45 
different states and foreign guests represent as many as 15 countries as far 
away as Nepal and Nigeria, Singapore and Somalia. Presidents that have visited 
Hannibal include Benjamin Harrison, Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, 
Herbert Hoover, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street is the Pilaster House, one of the oldest structures in 
Hannibal, where the Clemens family lived temporarily with Dr. Orville Grant 
after they lost their home due to financial setbacks. The first floor has been 
restored as a drugstore, with old-timey displays of medicine, bottles of herbs 
and chemicals and pharmaceutical products. For a time, Dr. Grant, who employed 
Mrs. Clemens as his nurse, ran the drugstore, customary in those days, for 
physicians who compounded and sold medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Living quarters above are furnished in a fairly elegant fashion, indicating the 
doctor's position in Hannibal society. After Judge Clemens died here in 1847, 
the family moved back to their old house. 
</P>
<P>
At 211 Hill, Laura Hawkins, classmate and childhood sweetheart of Twain in the 
1840s was later immortalized in print as Becky Thatcher. The lower floor is 
divided into souvenir shop and bookstore, stocking the largest selection of 
books by and about Twain. Upstairs was her bedroom and parlor, all open to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
Located at the base of Cardiff Hill, a setting for much of the activity in Tom 
Sawyer and a favorite haunt of Mark Twain's is the Tom and Huck Statue, 
believed to be the first in the U.S. to honor fictional characters. The 
lighthouse atop Cardiff Hill commemorates the birth of Mark Twain and was 
dedicated by Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
Clemens Law Office, where Judge John Clemens practiced as a Justice of the 
Peace, provided the backdrop for the trial of Muff Potter in "Tom Sawyer". It 
is the only building not on the original site, moved away from the flood plain 
area to preserve the structure. 
</P>
<P>
At 1000 Bird is the 30-room Rockliffe Mansion, once one of the finest river 
estates in America. It has been beautifully restored and in 1902, on Mark 
Twain's last visit, he addressed an audience of 300 from the stairway of this 
home which is now on the National Historic Register. 
</P>
<P>
Hannibal's Main Street is lined with renovated buildings from the mid-19th 
Century, that house specialty shops featuring woven rugs, rag dolls,, quilts, 
hand-painted folk art, pewter, primitives and hand-crafted baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Several sightseeing tours of the area are available. The Mark Twain Clopper 
features a horse-drawn wagon; the Twainland Express, an open air tram, covers 
10 m.p.h. Various sites can be also be explored on foot or car. 
</P>
<P>
Just a mile south of Hannibal, open for touring since 1886, is the Mark Twain 
Cave. In his autobiography, Twain wrote: "I think my mother was never in the 
cave in her life, but everyone else went there. It was a tangled wilderness of 
lofty clefts and passages. I got lost in it along with a lady and our last 
candle burned down to almost nothing before we glimpsed the search party's 
light." 
</P>
<P>
Relying on that memory, Twain dramatized Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher's 
adventure in that cave, being pursued by Injun Joe and it is one of the most 
thrilling episodes in the book and subsequent movie. 
</P>
<P>
On Rt. 1, just off I-61, is the Garth Woodside Mansion, an outstanding example 
of Victorian architecture, plus a 600-bush rose garden. Vacant for 43 years, 
this elegant river estate is now a popular bed and breakfast inn with special 
events planned for guests. 
</P>
<P>
A 400-passenger, triple-deck riverboat, Mark Twain, offers hourlong cruises 
during the day and dinner cruises with live music and dancing. Check the sign 
at Center Street Landing; the schedule varies in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
In an outdoor theater, "The Reflections of Mark Twain," a two-hour pageant with 
a cast of 25 local actors, enacts famous episodes from his writings. The 
dinner-theater plan is reasonably priced. Mid-May through mid-September at 
Clemens Landing. 
</P>
<P>
The Molly Brown Dinner Theater and Luncheon Show is a fast-paced musical revue 
with a Gay '90s and Roaring '20s theme. On the menu are rib eye steak and 
old-fashioned apple-candy pie. 
</P>
<P>
Special events during the year add to the region's charm: National Tom Sawyer 
Days, July 3-8, with contests, crafts and fence painting; Autumn Historic 
Folklife Festival, the third weekend in October, and Bluegrass Festivals in 
February and November head the list.

SOUTH CAROLINA'S OLD GEORGETOWN HARBORS SOME INTERESTING SECRETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As much as any town can today, the historic colonial port of Georgetown has the 
look of the Old South, and like much of the South it is rife with ghosts. I 
think I may have a crush on one of them. That's really how I happened to find 
Georgetown in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered down the East Coast are several charming old towns that thrived 
briefly as cosmopolitan centers, and then faded into the pages of history. 
</P>
<P>
I think of the shipping port of Salem in Massachusetts, which eventually 
declined as Boston grew, and nearby Annapolis, the Maryland capital that slept 
while Baltimore prospered. 
</P>
<P>
By chance, I stumbled this spring across yet another one, Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
Once reputedly the world's rice-exporting capital, it now is a quiet but 
appealing backwater that was long ago overshadowed by Charleston to the south. 
</P>
<P>
Like Salem and Annapolis, however, it has preserved many of the gorgeous old 
homes built by wealthy families in the town's heyday before the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown is about midway on the 100-mile drive down the South Carolina coast 
from Myrtle Beach to Charleston. 
</P>
<P>
I had never heard of the town before my Carolina trip this spring, and I 
remained unaware of its colonial significance until I got there. I might have 
hurried right through, except for Aaron Burr's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
I have read a couple of fairly recent biographies of Burr, the urbane but 
notorious U.S. vice president who fatally wounded Alexander Hamilton in a 
famous duel. 
</P>
<P>
One of the saddest periods in Burr's always-dramatic life was the tragic death 
of his intelligent and beautiful daughter Theodosia, wife of the governor of 
South Carolina, Joseph Alston. 
</P>
<P>
Planning to visit her father in New York City, Theodosia boarded a ship leaving 
South Carolina on Dec. 31, 1812. The ship vanished without a trace, an unsolved 
mystery. Perhaps pirates attacked -- one of the legends surrounding Theodosia 
-- or it was sunk by a fierce gale known to have hit the coast. 
</P>
<P>
For some unexplainable reason, Theodosia and the story of her untimely death 
intrigued me. I am usually forgetful of names, but I retain hers. Can I have 
formed a romantic crush across the centuries? Perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
She was one of the most admired women of her day. So it was with astonishment 
and great delight that I read her name on a historical marker a few miles 
outside Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
I am a sucker for these roadside snippets from the past, and more often than 
not I'm rewarded with an interesting historic anecdote. 
</P>
<P>
The sign informed me that Theodosia and her husband had lived in the Georgetown 
area. Their home site is now a part of Brookgreen Gardens, a large sculpture 
garden, just north of town, that's filled with an inviting mix of classically 
heroic and charmingly whimsical pieces. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Georgetown is the port from which Theodosia departed to meet her death. 
A huge 18th-Century mansion, the Man-Doyle House, still stands on Front Street, 
where she is said to have danced the night before the fatal trip. 
</P>
<P>
I decided I had to stop here for a while, drawn by my odd fascination with 
Theodosia. It is by such unexpected paths that travel discoveries are made. 
</P>
<P>
I gave myself an hour's time, but my visit stretched for another as 
Georgetown's attractions revealed themselves. A weekend would have been more 
satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
Several bed and breakfast inns offer lodgings in or near the impressive 
Georgetown Historic District, which covers several blocks. 
</P>
<P>
Shaded by a canopy of moss-draped oaks, Georgetown sits at the confluence of 
four rivers forming Winyah Bay. It might have been America's oldest European 
community, but the Spanish who settled in 1526 were quickly driven out by 
Indians and disease. The heritage, instead, is British, dating from 1729. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 homes, buildings and sites from the 1700s still remain in the 
historic district. Information about escorted or self-directed walking tours is 
available at the local chamber of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
The Harold Kaminski House, built about 1760, is a museum filled with antiques 
reflecting Georgetown's link to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Rice is no longer a commercial crop in South Carolina's coastal low country, 
but Georgetown today boasts a large and active shrimp-fishing fleet, which adds 
a definite bustle to its attractive waterfront setting. 
</P>
<P>
The town's colorful history is full of ghostly legends -- actually, Georgetown 
County enjoys some fame as the most haunted place in the South -- and the 
shrimping fleet has its own bag of superstitions. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 shrimp trawlers operate from the Georgetown wharf, all of them 
sporting tall masts. The top of each mast, I noticed, is painted white. 
</P>
<P>
A curious coincidence? I wondered. Not a coincidence at all, but rather 
something of a safety feature, I was told by Bill Oberst, a young history buff 
in the Georgetown Chamber of Commerce. His family dates back to the town's 
colonial origins. 
</P>
<P>
The local lore maintains, according to Oberst, that if a shrimping vessel 
starts to sink, the white mast provides an appropriately clean spot "where the 
hand of God can grab hold and pull the boat back up to safety." 
</P>
<P>
This city's local legends are brought to life in an annual summer theater 
production called "Ghosts of the Coast." 
</P>
<P>
In my short stay, I strolled along Harbor Walk, a boardwalk that stretches for 
a couple of blocks along the waterfront, where you can dine pleasantly on fresh 
shrimp. 
</P>
<P>
And I stepped inside the small but very interesting Rice Museum on Front 
Street, which tells the story of Georgetown's once-flourishing rice culture. 
</P>
<P>
Before the Civil War, the region supported more than 150 plantations, including 
one owned by Theodosia and her husband. But the end of slavery made cultivation 
impractical. 
</P>
<P>
Machines were developed that might have replaced slave labor, but they sank 
deep in the swampy soil of the low country. 
</P>
<P>
Just outside Georgetown, a number of the old rice plantations have been 
restored as private homes. 
</P>
<P>
Although these fine old mansions are not open to the public, daily river boat 
tours sail past them on the same murky river ways that served the plantations 
as commercial highways two centuries ago. Watch for alligators on one narrow 
stretch of the route called "Alligator Alley." 
</P>
<P>
My two hours passed too quickly, as I sniffed the sea air and walked along 
elegant old streets exploring another chapter in America's rich history. 
</P>
<P>
Oberst said he can stand under an old oak tree and feel things from the town's 
long past. I don't doubt him at all. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on Front Street before the Man-Doyle House, I easily imagined that I 
saw fair Theodosia in the second-floor ballroom enjoying a final dance before 
her fateful voyage. 
</P>
<P>

Chamber of Commerce, P.O. Box 1776, Georgetown, S.C. 29442, (803) 546-8437.

A LONG JOURNEY THAT BROUGHT FOUR LIVES TOGETHER UNDER AN ITALIAN SUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNE STEWART WETZEL, Wetzel is a free-lance writer living in Palo Alto, 
Calif. She is the author of a children's book, Onstage/Backstage (Carolrhoda, 
1987). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The crowded bus squeezed through the city gates of Florence and jolted to a 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
An elderly woman pushed her way inside. Her gray hair was pulled tightly into 
an uncompromising bun. A dark dress covered her matronly figure. 
</P>
<P>
Because she looked about the same age as my mother, I stood up and gave her my 
seat. A gold tooth flashed as she smiled her thanks at me. 
</P>
<P>
My mother also smiled as I lurched across the aisle of the crowded bus to stand 
beside her. Age was the only thing that she had in common with the Italian 
woman. Age and the perspiration that shone on everyone's face. 
</P>
<P>
Mother's white hair was fashionably short, her knit shirt and golfing skirt as 
distinctly American as my blond pageboy and summer khakis. On a local Italian 
bus, we looked as out of place as we felt. 
</P>
<P>
Drops of sweat itched new paths down my back as the bus curved around the dusty 
hills surrounding Florence. Through the windows, the unfamiliar landscape 
slipped by: small villages, farms, the occasional cemetery with exuberant 
statues marking the graves. 
</P>
<P>
We didn't talk much. 
</P>
<P>
Any visit to a relative's grave is hard. Even 45 years after the actual death, 
memories flood back. 
</P>
<P>
It was easier for me. I never knew my father. But my mother was going to visit 
her husband's grave. She had avoided everything associated with death for as 
long as I could remember. At 13, she had buried her mother; at 23, her first 
husband. Weary of the pain of funeral rites, she had not been to a funeral or a 
grave since. 
</P>
<P>
Neither had I. Yet when I planned to vacation in Europe, I knew I had to go to 
Italy to visit my father's grave. To my surprise, Mother wanted to come with 
me. 
</P>
<P>
The American Battle Monuments Commission sent a brochure with directions to the 
cemetery. They were simple and clear on paper: "Florence Cemetery is located on 
the west side of Via Cassia, about 7 1/2 miles south of Florence . . . The SITA 
bus station provides frequent bus service. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
It was easy to find the huge bus station in the center of Florence. But no one 
could tell us where to catch the bus we needed until a young woman at the 
tourist information window outside the station managed to locate a bus route to 
the Via Cassia. 
</P>
<P>
The bus left from a square named Santa Maria Novella, blocks away. So map in 
hand, we set out to find it. We would have walked past it, if I hadn't 
remembered the patterned elegance of the church that gave the square its name 
from a slide I'd seen, long ago, in a college art history class. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the windows of the bus were open, the heat kept rising as the sun 
drew nearer to the center of the sky. Mother's white hair was beginning to mat 
to her head. 
</P>
<P>
I reached down and squeezed her shoulder; she patted my hand. I gave the 
desperate, silent prayer of the traveler who doesn't speak the language: 
"Please, God, let us be on the right bus." 
</P>
<P>
We kept looking for the unmistakable symmetry of an American military cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a bus stop conveniently located just outside the gate," the pamphlet 
had said. But what if the folds of the hills hid the cemetery from view? Where 
would we end up if we missed it? 
</P>
<P>
We were empty-handed. We'd planned to buy flowers at one of the many flower 
stands by the bus station, but had been too confused to add another task to our 
journey. 
</P>
<P>
Firenze . . . what the Italians call Florence, the city of flowers. Few flowers 
bloomed by the dusty roadside on this hot July day. 
</P>
<P>
My father must have known these hills, this heat. In July of 1944, the U.S. 
Army had reached the outskirts of Florence as they fought their way north from 
Rome. He died on the 13th. I was not yet a year old; he was 23. But I had grown 
older and he had not. 
</P>
<P>
The bus emptied as we drove farther and farther from Florence, but the elderly 
Italian woman still sat across the aisle in the seat I had given her. I envied 
her for the comfort of her routine. She knew where she was going. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe she would also know where we were going. 
</P>
<P>
"Cimitero Americano?" I asked her. 
</P>
<P>
She frowned in puzzlement and shook her head with an apologetic smile. She 
couldn't understand my pronunciation, but our hotel clerk had written down our 
destination. I handed the paper to her. She read it and looked quickly from me 
to my mother, then, in a few gestures, indicated that she would tell us when to 
get off the bus. 
</P>
<P>
There was, after all, little choice. The bus reached the small town at the end 
of the line and dropped the three of us, the last of its passengers, before it 
swung off the main road and turned to go back to Florence. 
</P>
<P>
We stood together in the glare of the July sun. Pleasant stucco homes painted 
in soft pastels lined each side of the road. The woman pointed in the direction 
the bus had been traveling before it turned, moving her arms to show it was a 
long walk. She looked troubled. 
</P>
<P>
"Taxi?" The word means the same thing in English and Italian. 
</P>
<P>
So did her answer. "Solo Firenze" (only in Florence). 
</P>
<P>
That was when I noticed Mother angrily wiping her eyes, furious with herself 
for losing control. With a fierce determination, she set off down the road in 
the noonday heat. 
</P>
<P>
"Scusi, mio papa . . . " I didn't know enough Italian to say more than "Excuse 
us, my father . . . " But the woman understood, better than I could. She would 
have been in her teens or early 20s during World War II. She must have known 
many men who died too young. 
</P>
<P>
I tried to thank her for her help but she wasn't ready to leave us. She caught 
up with my mother, motioned us across the street to a pale blue house, and 
urged us to enter. In that hot, foreign town, she had become our guardian 
angel. It was impossible not to follow her. 
</P>
<P>
We entered a kitchen -- cool, dark and high-ceilinged. A younger woman stood at 
the counter, fixing lunch. At her mother's quick explanation, she made us 
welcome. 
</P>
<P>
The four of us -- two mothers, two daughters -- sat around the kitchen table. A 
kitchen table is a familiar place. I don't know who began to cry first, my 
mother or the elderly Italian woman. But as they sat and shared the unspoken 
pain of their memories, their daughters cried with them. 
</P>
<P>
When the crying stopped, the responsibility for our journey had somehow shifted 
from us to the two Italian women. They began an urgent discussion that ended 
only when the daughter got up and left the house. We knew that she was 
arranging help, but we had no idea what form that help would take, until she 
returned five minutes later with the joyous sound of car keys jingling in her 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
It was a short ride to the cemetery, less than 10 minutes by car. They let us 
out at the gate and my mother and the elderly Italian woman embraced. 
</P>
<P>
They came from two different parts of the world. They could not speak the 
other's language. They would never see each other again. But they had 
everything in common. In their youth, they had shared the horrors of a world at 
war. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the cemetery, everything became easy. Suddenly, we found ourselves on 
American soil, speaking in English. Everyone was solicitous. As next of kin, we 
would be driven back to Florence. If only we had called, we could have been 
picked up at our hotel. The proper grave site was identified and we were driven 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
Row after row of graves lined the slope of a hillside. The cemetery was 
arranged with military precision, carefully organized by alphabetical section, 
neatly bordered with trees. Into each soldier's headstone was carved his name, 
rank, military unit, home state and the date of his death. The rows of crosses 
were broken occasionally by the Star of David or the crescent of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
In Section F, Row 9, Grave 35, I met my father for the first time since I was a 
week old. He lay between a staff sergeant from New York and a Tec 5 from 
Oklahoma. What journeys they took to reach that spot, I'll never know. 
</P>
<P>
After a few minutes, I walked over and sat down in the shade of one of the tall 
trees that bordered the graves. My mother needed private time with her 
memories. I didn't share them, as my father had never been able to share my 
life. 
</P>
<P>
As I sat there, playing with a blade of grass, I decided to send flowers when I 
got back to the States. For Christmas and Easter and my father's birthday. I 
wanted to share them with him.

WORLD WATCH: SILK ROAD SMOOTHS WAY INTO CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
World Travel Watch is a monthly report designed to help you make informed 
judgments about travel throughout the world. Because conditions can change 
overnight, always make your own inquiries before you leave home. In the United 
States, contact the nearest passport agency office; abroad, check in with the 
nearest American embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Asia 
</P>
<P>
China/Pakistan: The Kunjerab Pass on the Karakoram Highway at the 
China/Pakistan border is closed. Although Kashgar, the oasis market town in far 
west China, has been reopened to tourists, the only way in at this time is the 
long way around -- through China on the Silk Road. 
</P>
<P>
India: Troubled Kashmir remains off-limits to travelers, but the governments of 
India and Pakistan have agreed to hold high-level talks soon to try to work out 
a solution in the contested region. 
</P>
<P>
Nepal: Katmandu is essentially peaceful now, with curfews ended, but expect the 
occasional disruption of services by workers' strikes, a new phenomenon that 
has come with the hard-earned democracy. Trekking agencies are planning for a 
good autumn season. 
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka: After nine months of relative peace, increased foreign investment 
and renewed tourism, violence has returned on a disturbing scale with Tamil 
guerrillas in the north and east abandoning a year-old cease-fire and attacking 
police installations. Several massacres by Tamil guerrillas have been reported 
in outlying villages. With tough talk coming from military leaders about 
showing the insurgents no mercy, it appears the spiral of violence will 
continue. Exercise caution and avoid traveling to areas in and around Jaffna, 
Trincomalee and Batticaloa. 
</P>
<P>
Africa 
</P>
<P>
Algeria: Islamic fundamentalists swept recent elections in this heretofore 
secular North African country. What this means for travelers is uncertain, 
though alcohol proscription and a conservative Islamic dress code for women 
(and its attendant effect on female travelers) may be ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Gabon: Unnecessary travel to Port Gentil should be avoided due to recent civil 
unrest and demonstrations. Check with the U.S. Embassy in Libreville for 
updated information, and register with the U.S. Embassy on arrival in Gabon. 
</P>
<P>
Liberia: Although the civil war has quieted and peace talks are under way, the 
country remains volatile. Avoid travel here at this time. 
</P>
<P>
Europe/Soviet Union 
</P>
<P>
France/Germany/the Netherlands/Belgium/Luxembourg: By early 1992, these 
countries hope to abolish border checks, months in advance of the 12-nation 
European Community's deadline of Jan. 1, 1993, to remove internal border 
controls. Known as the Schengen Accord for the Luxembourg town in which it was 
signed June 19, the agreement (when it is ratified by the five countries) 
should speed cross-border traffic and give the EEC some experience in border 
integration. 
</P>
<P>
Romania: Unrest continues and the potential for violence remains, especially in 
Bucharest. Exercise caution, and avoid any demonstrations or large gatherings 
of people. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet Union: In major cities such as Moscow and Leningrad, the dollar is king. 
Expect to pay for taxis and restaurant and hotel services with greenbacks, not 
rubles. Bring along a good supply of $1, $5 and $10 bills. 
</P>
<P>
Caribbean/Central America 
</P>
<P>
Dominican Republic: The dollar goes a long way here, but be careful with 
tortoise-shell products. Many tortoise species are endangered and importation 
of such goods to the United States is prohibited. These items could be seized 
by U. S. Customs and their bearers subject to fines. It's best to avoid buying 
any animal products. 
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua: Now that the eight-year civil war has ended, hopes are high that the 
troubled country can move ahead into a new era of peace and prosperity. 
Visitors must exchange $60 U.S. into cordobas at the port of entry. Major 
hotels in Managua, and some smaller hotels and hostels, charge foreigners in U. 
S. currency and won't accept traveler's checks, so make sure you take enough 
cash to cover expenses. Credit cards are infrequently accepted. Travel from 
Honduras to Nicaragua should be done only by air because of border security 
problems, including minefields, particularly along the Rio Coco and Atlantic 
Coast region. 
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia 
</P>
<P>
Cambodia: The Khmer Rouge has agreed to proposals for putting the 12th-Century 
ruins of Angkor Wat under U.N. management as a demilitarized zone. 
</P>

TRAVEL VIDEOS: ENGLAND FROM TWO PERSPECTIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Touring England" (Questar Video Communications, 65 minutes, 1989). 
</P>
<P>
This is a well-photographed, well-narrated, traditional travelogue that visits 
many of the myriad tourist attractions of England, plus a few in Wales. What 
makes this video different is the inclusion of film clips of 20th-Century news 
events that are associated with some of the historic sights. 
</P>
<P>
The video explores Dover and then Canterbury, indelibly imprinted with the 
tales of Chaucer and the murder of Thomas a Becket; the resort town of 
Brighton, and the naval port of Portsmouth, where Henry VIII's salvaged ship, 
Mary Rose, and Lord Nelson's flagship, Victory, are on view. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in southern England, the video moves to mysterious Stonehenge, 
several manor houses, Salisbury Cathedral, Plymouth and the ancient Roman spa 
of Bath. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to Shrewsbury includes the historic Iron Bridge, built in 1797, and a 
ride on an old steam train through the scenic countryside. 
</P>
<P>
China and porcelain fanciers will be interested in the factories of Wegwood, 
Spode and Royal Dalton near Stoke-on-Trent and the Gladstone Pottery Museum at 
Longton. 
</P>
<P>
Cardiff and Caernarfon are major stops on the side trip to Wales, where news 
film clips show the investiture of the Prince of Wales, and the voice of actor 
Richard Burton can be heard reminiscing about his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Tours are also of Liverpool, the home of the Beatles and a center for pop art; 
the Lake District, where William Wordsworth lived; York, with a visit to the 
National Railway Museum, and Haworth, the home of the Bronte sisters and the 
setting for Emily Bronte's "Wuthering Heights." 
</P>
<P>
In Sherwood Forest, the Jerusalem Pub, "oldest in England," is shown, as is 
Cambridge for the colleges and punting on the River Cam. At Windsor Castle, 
film clips show King Edward VIII making his abdication speech and a side trip 
takes in Runnymede and the John F. Kennedy Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the film offers the usual tourist sights. Changing of the Guard, the 
homes of many of the famous persons who at one time or another made London 
their home, and film clips of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II at 
Westminster Abbey. Also, the wedding of Prince Charles at St. Paul's Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
Other places cover Jack the Ripper's London, St. James and Hyde parks, the 
theater districts of Picadilly Circus and Covent Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Short trips out of London include Oxford University, Blenheim Palace, 
Stratford-on-Avon and medieval Warwick Castle. 
</P>
<P>
At Coventry, viewers get to see the famous cathedral in ruins after World War 
II and scenes of its restoration. 
</P>
<P>
No tips or travel recommendations are included in the video. 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from Questar Video Communications, P.O. Box 11345, Chicago 
60600, (800) 544-8422. Price is$29.95. 
</P>
<P>
"Great Britain by Train, Legendary Journeys" (Taylored Video Services, 30 
minutes, 1989). 
</P>
<P>
This is a promotional video describing the British rail system and despite, or 
perhaps because of, its commercial aspects, will be especially helpful to the 
traveler considering a tour by rail. 
</P>
<P>
Highlighted with scenes of various destinations, including Wales and Scotland, 
the video and narration provide a wealth of information on such things as the 
economic advantages of rail travel and the different types of rail passes 
available -- first-class, economy, youth, senior, etc. 
</P>
<P>
It offers a reminder that passes must be purchased in the United States, not in 
Britain, how and where to obtain them, how to best use the system, when 
reservations are needed, the length of time for some trips, plus the 
availability of rail/drive packages. 
</P>
<P>
There are interior scenes of rail cars, some of the rail stations and their 
facilities, plus views of the scenery from trains. The video is pleasant 
viewing even if you're not planning to tour by rail. 
</P>
<P>
Tapes are available from Taylored Video Services, 4401 Colwick Drive, Box 68, 
Charlotte, N.C. 28211, (704) 366-0404. Price: $19.95.

HER WORLD: INSIDE TIPS MAY LEAD TO GREAT FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MORGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My goddaughter Alex, age 21, swept into The Jockey Club on New York City's 
Central Park South and gave me a boisterous hug. She is tall, lovely and 
self-assured. She is full of life: coping with her first job amid the rigors of 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
In a rich, low voice, she was describing her flat in Greenwich Village, her 
work for the designer Adrienne Vittadini and some of the New York City 
characters she has met. 
</P>
<P>
Then, suddenly, she stopped talking, her mouth still open, her eyes transfixed 
at a middle distance. I followed her gaze. 
</P>
<P>
Walking toward us was a vision in satin, white hair and luminous skin: the 
actress Jessica Tandy, fresh from her Academy Award. The crowd in this elegant 
lounge parted and fell silent. A handsome woman near the bar seemed to curtsy. 
</P>
<P>
"Miss Tandy," a gentleman said, rising from his table. "Congratulations." 
</P>
<P>
She smiled. 
</P>
<P>
The tableau -- with its remarkable response of respect and admiration -- 
reminded me of the night I met Queen Elizabeth when the English royals were 
touring California a few winters back. Ms. Tandy and the Queen have the same 
porcelain complexion, and an inner glow that bathes their faces in light. The 
actor Hume Cronyn, as invisible as Prince Philip, followed his wife into the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't she wonderful?" my goddaughter said, finally turning back to our table. 
"Did you see her face? Have you seen the movie 'Driving Miss Daisy?' Did you 
see the play? I hope I look that way when I'm 80." 
</P>
<P>
Alex, though star-struck by the best of them, had recovered her sense of 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
This encounter was a happy reminder of the pleasures inherent in meeting a 
friend or relative in the middle of a trip. You may want to travel alone, but 
that does not mean that you can't ring up a cousin who's living in Basel or a 
neighbor who's studying in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
After a week or two of singular adventure, it's nice to trade notes with a 
friend -- especially if that person knows the city where you meet and will 
share inside tips. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a friend had told me that The Jockey Club -- a mellow, 
pine-paneled restaurant in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel -- is a magnet for 
celebrities who seek fine food and privacy. The Tandy-Cronyn arrival certainly 
filled that bill. And the night before, Betsy and Walter Cronkite had been 
there celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
My goddaughter, however, had made other dining plans, so we grabbed coats and 
umbrellas and pushed into the rain along Central Park South. Lines had formed 
under the canopies at each hotel. Doormen's whistles trilled in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
"No chance for a taxi now," Alex said with native wisdom. "The theater, you 
know, and the rain." 
</P>
<P>
And so we walked -- or strode -- at a brisk New York City pace toward Fifth 
Avenue. Rows of wet horses and hansom cabs were curbed near the Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"Their stables are on the West Side in the 30s," said Alex, who loves animals. 
"Poor things. I bet they'd like to go home and get dry." 
</P>
<P>
I always learn unexpected things from traveling with Alex. 
</P>
<P>
Alex had made reservations at the Paper Moon Milano on East 58th. We stepped 
into this cozy copy of a Milan favorite and stacked our umbrellas by the door. 
</P>
<P>
From a tempting menu, Alex ordered in Italian: penne all'arrabbiata (tube pasta 
with tomato, parsley, garlic and crushed red peppers) and the special 
pappardelle (a wide, flat pasta with bacon, Parmesan, tomato and cream). She 
told the waiter that she had discovered the original Paper Moon Milano during a 
college term in Florence. 
</P>
<P>
His dark eyes sparkled. He asked when she had lived in Tuscany and complimented 
her on her accent. 
</P>
<P>
And then Alex started to blush. Like red wine poured into a crystal goblet, her 
face had a sudden glow. 
</P>
<P>
It was not the cool, luminous light she'd admired in Jessica Tandy. But it was 
young and charming. And at the next table, an Italian couple nodded in 
approval.

Waterford is celebrated for its fair, but it can be a day-trip from Washington 
or an idyllic weekend getaway at other times. Surrounding Loudoun County is 
known for its scenery, hunts, horse races, antiques and such historic sites as 
Harpers Ferry and Oatlands. 
</P>
<P>
The fair will be held Oct. 5-7, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day. Admission is 
$10 a day (children 12 and younger are admitted free). Advance tickets are 
available by mail for $8 from the Waterford Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
How to get there: Waterford is about 15 miles from Dulles International Airport 
and 40 miles northwest of Washington. From Washington, take Route 7 west past 
Leesburg, then Route 9 north toward Charles Town for 1/4 mile and turn right on 
Route 662. Go four miles to Waterford. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations: The Waterford Inn (P.O. Box 227, Second and Church streets, 
Waterford, Va. 22190-0227, (703) 882-3465) is a charming, Victorian bed and

The Cornerstone (Route 1, Box 82-C, Routes 9 &amp; 662, Paeonian Springs, Va. 
22129, (703) 882-3722) is a bed and breakfast on a farm four miles outside 
Waterford. What it lacks in charm, it makes up for with a swimming pool and 
evening deer watch. Double rooms are $65, which includes a bountiful country 
breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
Where to eat: Tuscarora (203 Harrison St., Leesburg, Va., (703) 771-9300) is 
set in an attractively restored 1899 mill. It serves American cuisine with 
fresh local and imported ingredients, including crab cakes, duck, salmon, veal 
and lamb. Dinner for two without liquor runs $50-$60. 
</P>
<P>
Wayside Gardens (420 W. Colonial Highway, Hamilton, Va., (703) 338-4315) offers 
good food at reasonable prices in an informal, funky setting. Hickory-smoked 
chicken, ribs, trout and barbecued pork are served in a tiny roadside trailer 
or out back on a patio under a stand of oak trees. Try the French fries. Dinner 
for two without liquor runs $25-$30. 
</P>
<P>
For more information: Contact the Waterford Foundation, P.O. Box 142, 
Waterford, Va. 22190, (703) 882-3018. A copy of last year's detailed fair

As an expatriate Yorkshire woman residing in California since 1952, I feel 
compelled to write you a criticism of the Judith Morgan article, "This 
Part-Time Job Is One Worth Crying About," June 17. Three times in the story, 
the cathedral York Minster in York, England, was incorrectly referred to as 
York Minister. 
</P>
<P>
Minster is originally a word of Norse extraction, meaning a large 
cathedral-like church or monastery. A minister (person) it is not! 
</P>
<P>
If Morgan really was in York, then she surely was exposed to countless leaflets 
about the lovely and famous York Minster, as well as numerous street signs, all 
pointing the way to this most historic edifice. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, York is a beautiful city and the Minster an absolute architectural 
gem, well worth visiting.

Judith Morgan's article on York brought back memories of a delightful visit. 
</P>
<P>
But when I was there, I attended a service at the York Minster, not the York 
Minister. It's an easy mistake. I, too, made it once, and was quickly informed 
of my error.

ONLY IN PARIS, DARLING! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Horace Sutton's article, "Manhattan's Times Square Boasts Another 
Enthusiastic Renaissance," June 10, he mentions a restaurant "run by one of the 
adopted sons of Josephine Baker, darling of Paris and New York City in the 
'20s." 
</P>
<P>
Baker certainly was the darling of Paris, and all of France, after going there 
in a black revue late in the '20s, but she was never the darling of New York 
City, even on her infrequent returns. I lived in New York City in the '20s, and 
for many decades thereafter. I think I know more about that city than Sutton 
will ever learn.

<P>
The massive mobilization for World War II propelled gay men and lesbians into 
the mainstream of American life. Ironically the screening and discharge 
policies, together with the drafting of millions of men, weakened barriers that 
had kept gay people trapped and hidden at the margins of society. Discovering 
that they shared a common cause, they were more willing and able to defend 
themselves, as their ability to work, congregate and lead sexual lives came 
under escalating attack in the postwar decade. 
</P>
<P>
Long before the war, a chain of social constraints immobilized many gay men and 
women, keeping them invisible, isolated, silent, ignorant and trivialized. As 
young people, they learned to hide their homosexual feelings in fear and shame, 
helping to perpetuate the myth that people like them didn't exist. Locked in a 
closet of lies and deceptions, many people with homosexual desires mistakenly 
believed they were the only ones in the world -- often not even knowing what to 
call themselves. 
</P>
<P>
When publicly acknowledged, they were caricatured as "fairies" and "mannish" 
women, freaks whose lives were trivialized as silly, so that many lesbians and 
gay men learned not to take themselves or each other seriously. Such insidious 
forms of social control worked below the surface of daily life through unspoken 
fears and paralyzing shame, coming into view only in sporadic acts of violence, 
arrests, school expulsions, firings or religious condemnations. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the mobilization for World War II helped to loosen the constraints 
that locked so many gay people in silence and self-contempt. Selective Service 
acknowledged the importance of gay men when it drafted hundreds of thousands 
and broke the silence when examiners asked millions of selectees about their 
homosexual tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
The draft, together with lax recruitment policies allowing lesbians to enter 
the military, placed a generation of gay men and women in gender-segregated 
bases where they could find each other, form cliques and discover the gay life 
in cities. Classification officers assigned even the most "mannish" women and 
effeminate men to stereotyped duties, recognizing that these previously 
marginal people were useful and even indispensable to the war effort. 
</P>
<P>
Changes in policy brought similarly dramatic effects. Military officials 
intensified the significance of homosexuality by building a bureaucratic 
apparatus to manage homosexual personnel. In the process, they inadvertently 
gave gay inductees and soldiers the option to avoid compulsory military service 
by coming out. Psychiatrists gave soldiers, as well as military officials, a 
biased but useful new language and set of concepts -- such as the word 
homosexual and the idea of a "personality type" -- that some used to categorize 
homosexuals, understand homosexuality and even define themselves. 
</P>
<P>
During purges, interrogators terrorized suspects into breaking their protective 
silence, forcing them to describe their homosexual lives, make confessions and 
name friends and sexual partners. Officers who aggressively rooted out 
homosexuals and exposed them further destroyed their ability to hide in the 
closet, forcing them to lead new lives as known homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
As these soldiers were thrown together into psych wards and queer stockades, 
they endured the same hardships and were better able to see themselves as 
compatriots victimized by the same persecution. When they were discharged as 
undesirables -- without benefits and without being charged with any crime -- 
gay men and women gained a cause, a target to attack and new avenues of appeal 
to defend their rights as gay GIs and veterans. 
</P>
<P>
Disrupted and exposed by the war, gay life in the postwar years seemed to 
expand at an unprecedented rate. The proliferation of gay bars, the broadening 
of public discussion of homosexuality, the formulation of the idea that 
homosexuals constituted a minority, the widespread acceptance of the 
psychiatric model of homosexuals as sexual psychopaths, the emergence and 
growth of federal anti-homosexual policies and the new avenues for gay citizens 
to appeal government injustices were some of the many legacies of World War II. 
These changes had a powerful impact on how a nation would respond to 
homosexuality long after the war. 
</P>
<P>
World War II veterans were the first generation of gay men and women to 
experience such rapid, dramatic and widespread changes in their lives as 
homosexuals. They felt a growing sense that, as veterans, they were being 
treated unfairly when singled out for persecution; they should be able to live 
their lives in peace as long as they did their jobs and didn't hurt anyone 
else. Under heavy attack during the postwar decade, however, most gay male and 
lesbian citizens refrained from publicly standing up for themselves or even 
talking about their lives. 
</P>
<P>
But the postwar years were also a period of new possibilities that strengthened 
and developed gay culture. Despite the mounting political war against them, the 
generation of World War II gay veterans responded to a hostile environment by 
expanding their "closet" -- making it a roomier place to live. 
</P>
<P>
Previous generations had invented the closet -- a system of lies, denials, 
disguises and double-entendres -- that enabled them to express some 
homosexuality by pretending it didn't exist and hiding it from view. A later 
generation would "come out of the closet," learning to live as proud and openly 
gay men and women and demanding public recognition. But the World War II 
generation slowly stretched their closet to its limits, not proclaiming their 
homosexuality in public but not willing to live lonely lives. 
</P>
<P>
In increasing numbers, these men and women went to gay and lesbian bars that 
proliferated despite new state laws designed to put them out of business. In 
the late 1940s, gay bars opened for the first time in such medium-size cities 
as Kansas City, Mo.; Richmond, Va.; Worcester, Mass., and San Jose, Calif. 
Another gay institution, the bathhouse, also proliferated after the war. 
</P>
<P>
It was in this social climate that the first signs of a continuous gay 
political movement and press emerged in the United States. In 1950, the 
Mattachine Society was organized in Los Angeles -- primarily by war veterans -- 
in response to the anti-homosexual campaigns in Washington, police arrests in 
Los Angeles, the treatment of homosexuals by the military and the crackdowns on 
gay and lesbian bars. In 1955, women in San Francisco started the Daughters of 
Bilitis, the first lesbian-rights organization in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The generation of gay men and women who served in World War II grew into 
adulthood fighting one war for their country and another to protect themselves 
from their government's escalating mobilization against them. When they 
returned to civilian life, some fought for their right to be treated fairly as 
patients, veterans and citizens. For others, a quiet sense of belonging was 
victory enough, to have the chance to fit into the country they fought for, 
leading ordinary but unapologetic lives. 
</P>
<P>
As they grow into old age and once again face death, most still blend into the 
world around them, while some have come out -- either under fire or on their 
own. Today they witness an expanding public debate over the military's 
exclusion of homosexuals. To be serious, that debate must include a sense of 
history -- not only of how the military established its anti-gay policy during 
World War II, and then suppressed all internal dissent, but also of how the men 
and women who were the policy's first targets fought and died for their country 
with the rest of their generation.

SHOULD UC ADMISSIONS SET ETHNIC AND RACIAL GOALS?; 
</P>
<P>
STANDARDS MUST REMAIN HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

University, is a former member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and a

<P>
California legislators will be unable to confront some of the more serious 
issues facing higher education unless they drop the notion that equality means 
every ethnic group must be proportionally represented in our state 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
If passed, Assemblyman Tom Hayden's bill would require the University of 
California's nine campuses, the 19 institutions of the state university system 
and all 100 community colleges "strive to approximate, by the year 2000, the 
general ethnic, gender, economic and regional compositions of recent high 
school graduates, both in first-year classes and subsequent college and 
university graduating classes." 
</P>
<P>
A further provision of the bill is the continued use of "special admissions 
standards" to increase enrollment proportions of minority students not eligible 
for admission to UC through the "regular" admissions categories. 
</P>
<P>
Although the bill's language is imprecise, its general intent seems clear: 
California's colleges and universities should guarantee the "right" proportion 
of minority students in the freshman class and then, once enrolled, take steps 
to ensure their successful graduation. 
</P>
<P>
But there are two immediate and stubborn problems. The first involves the 
distressing dropout rate of minority students admitted to the University of 
California, because of a policy that admits many students with insufficient 
academic qualifications who then leave without graduating. The second problem 
revolves around increased demands nationally for higher standards for both 
teachers and students. Yet, efforts to raise educational standards run up 
against the certainty that, whatever standard is set, some people will not be 
able to meet it. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is exacerbated by ethnic, economic and racial factors. Stated 
simply, a greater percentage of blacks and Latinos fail than whites and Asians 
and, of late, more blacks than Latinos. Harvard sociologist Nathan Glazer has 
said any attempt to apply a high standard of competence across the board means 
more blacks fail. Sadly, that is happening to a discouragingly large number of 
blacks in institutions of higher education. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the raising of standards comes into direct conflict with the effort to 
reach "parity" -- to achieve proportions of blacks and Latinos at each level of 
the educational system that roughly match their proportions in the population 
at large. 
</P>
<P>
More alarming are critics such as Charles Willie, a professor of education at 
Harvard, who says "excellence" should not be the primary concern of the 
university because it serves to exclude minorities. Instead, he says, the 
university should be concerned with "adequacy." Any talk of a master 
university, he insists, smacks of a master race. 
</P>
<P>
Willie adds that many whites who are highly qualified will have to make room 
for those qualified on the basis of other kinds of "intelligence." He 
acknowledges that white and Asian students with straight-A averages were turned 
away from UC Berkeley, an action he claims is justified in the name of 
"diversity." As for the way universities hire their faculty, Willie says they 
should not choose the "best," but should instead give precedence to minority 
candidates who fall within the range of adequacy. 
</P>
<P>
Willie's recommendations to "rescue" members of minority groups from the 
requirements and standards of academic excellence are a sure recipe for 
mediocrity. Such proposals -- no matter how often they are bathed in the warm 
light of "diversity" and "pluralism" -- are demeaning to minority students who 
do not wish to be treated as exceptions to legitimate academic requirements. 
</P>
<P>
There is also something terribly wrong about an affirmative-action "parity" 
principle when, in the name of group equity, the percentage of whites in the 
fall, 1989, Berkeley freshman class is only 32% -- even though they comprise 
about 60% of California's public high-school graduates and almost 70% of those 
academically eligible for admission to the UC system. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone wants to see growing numbers of students from under-represented groups 
in the freshman class. The question, however, is whether this commendable goal 
should replace the principles of individual achievement, merit and academic 
excellence as the primary criteria for university admissions. 
</P>
<P>
Both Legislators and educators should concentrate less on the body count of 
minority students admitted to Berkeley or UCLA and more on assuring that those 
admitted can do the work and will graduate. The real challenge to California's 
top universities is whether they can improve the education of all students to 
the point where there can be diversity without a racially-based lowering of 
performance standards or a decline in intellectual quality.

SHOULD UC ADMISSIONS SET ETHNIC AND RACIAL GOALS?; 
</P>
<P>
UC DIVERSITY CRITICAL GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

chancellor for academic development at UCLA.

<P>
As competition for places in the University of California has intensified, so, 
too, has concern over the issue of accessibility -- a concern that is likely to 
grow as the state's population swells and as tuition at comparable private 
universities approaches $20,000 annually. California parents want assurances 
that their children will have a fair opportunity to be admitted. 
</P>
<P>
The term one hears regarding the admissions policies of the university is 
"equity." To some, equity means a uniform admissions standard for all 
applicants, generally based on a tabulation of high-school grades and scores on 
standardized tests. To others, equity means enrolling a student body that 
reflects the composition of the state's population in relation to such 
characteristics as race, ethnicity and physical disability. Assembly Bill 462 
explicitly defines equity in terms of a "diverse student body" and a 
"multicultural democracy," while virtually ignoring the issues of grades and 
standardized tests. 
</P>
<P>
The bill's expression of commitment to diversity is laudable, and it is already 
in practice. The UC regents strive for a student body that "demonstrates high 
academic achievement or exceptional personal talent, and that encompasses the 
broad diversity of cultural, racial, geographic and socioeconomic backgrounds 
characteristic of California." 
</P>
<P>
For UCLA's 1990 freshman class, for example, grades and test scores alone were 
used to admit some 60% of the students. For the remaining 40%, supplemental 
criteria were applied. That criteria includes: special talents, such as ability 
in music or painting; special circumstances, such as physical disabilities; low 
family income and education and ethnic identity. It should be emphasized that 
in the absence of a solid academic record, the supplemental criteria would be 
insufficient to insure a particular applicant's admission. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman admissions procedures can be easily understood by comparing two 
fictional but typical UCLA applicants. The first is Caucasian, a graduate of a 
prestigious private high school with nearly a straight "A" average and test 
scores in the 94th percentile. He lives in an affluent area of the San Fernando 
Valley and has never worked during the school year. His parents are both 
college-educated and have a combined annual income of $90,000. Applicant I has 
traveled widely in the United States and Europe and expects to have a 
successful career as a businessman. 
</P>
<P>
The second applicant is Latino, the graduate of a public high school in a 
working-class neighborhood in central Los Angeles. Her academic record shows an 
"A-" average and test scores in the 55th percentile, despite the fact that 
English is her second language. Applicant II works 20 hours a week during the 
school year and full-time every summer. Neither of her parents completed high 
school and together manage an income of $29,000. Applicant II has been out of 
California twice to visit relatives in Texas. She has hopes for a career as a 
lawyer, but is apprehensive about the expense of law school. 
</P>
<P>
Applicant I has obviously made the most of his privileged position while 
Applicant II has overcome various obstacles -- the learning of a second 
language, the absence of educational role models in the home and the need to 
work after school -- to arrive at the gates of UCLA. A rigid, uniform 
admissions policy based solely on grade-point averages and test scores would 
regard Applicant II as significantly less qualified than Applicant I. A truly 
equitable admissions policy, would not only place her academic record in a 
cultural and economic context but also recognizes her accomplishments as 
equivalent to those of Applicant I. 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that recent UC admissions policies have been instrumental not 
only in providing greater access to all segments of the state's population but 
in revitalizing the university -- particularly campuses at Berkeley and Los 
Angeles where the movement toward diversity is most palpable. 
</P>
<P>
More faculty of color will be appointed; the curriculum will expand beyond its 
traditional Western civilization focus to include the histories of Africa, 
Latin American and Asia. The university will emphasize the need to prepare its 
graduates to function in the "multicultural democracy" of AB 462, all the while 
maintaining its academic pre-eminence. 
</P>
<P>
UC admissions policies also contain a substantial portion of economic 
self-interest. As the Anglo population of California ages, the burden of 
financing state government will fall on a largely minority work force. Unless 
that work force is sufficiently well-educated it will be unable to generate the 
income necessary to sustain the present standard of living in California and 
provide benefits for the retired, largely Anglo population. The UC commitment 
to diversity in its admissions policies is an investment in California's 
economic future.

OLVERA STREET: ONE PERSON'S FANTASY BECOMES LOS ANGELES REALPOLITIK; 
</P>
<P>
RESTORATION: PROVING THE PAST CAN BE WHAT YOU PERCEIVE IT, A CRIME-RIDDEN, 
RAT-INFESTED SERVICE ROAD WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A MEXICAN MARKETPLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Leonard Pitt, Leonard Pitt is a professor of history at Cal State 
Northridge.

<TEXT>
<P>
The intense emotions swirling around the debate over the historical restoration 
of Olvera Street suggest the street's Mexican market is as eternal and fixed as 
the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. In truth, it was invented out of whole cloth 
in 1930, by a civic activist inspired by a California past that existed mostly 
in fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
Olvera Street is part of the historically significant Old Plaza area, where 44 
colonists from Sinaloa and Sonora, Mexico, founded El Pueblo de Los Angeles in 
1781. Today, it consists of 44 acres incorporated into the city-owned El Pueblo 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a mercado on Olvera Street was conceived in 1929, by Christine 
Sterling, a San Franciscan, who had never visited Mexico. She was from an Anglo 
family of modest financial means. Her father was said to have invented the 
cable car; her late husband had been a Hollywood producer. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by the romantic vision of old California personified in the Ramona 
legend and the movement to preserve the state's missions, Sterling dreamed of 
creating a Mexican marketplace in Los Angeles to preserve the old buildings of 
the region and promote Mexican crafts. 
</P>
<P>
She focused her creative energies on an unpaved service road for commercial and 
light-industrial businesses that fronted Main and Los Angeles streets. No 
retail businesses had existed there since it had opened in 1877. Olvera Street, 
in fact, was a crime-ridden, rat-infested, unsightly gash in the center of the 
plaza. In Sterling's mind, however, it was the perfect setting for a romantic 
mercado. 
</P>
<P>
Moving into the Avila adobe after city health officials condemned it, she saved 
the adobe from the wrecking ball. (She lived there until her death in 1963.) 
With Avila as her mercado headquarters, she secured mostly moral but some 
financial backing from six prominent Angelenos -- including Harry Chandler of 
The Los Angeles Times, attorney Henry O'Melveny and railroad magnate Moses 
Sherman. The $25,000 she raised paid for rent and repairs along Olvera Street. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners whose back doors opened onto the street bitterly resisted the 
mercado proposal. They complained to the City Council and mayor that closing 
the road would interfere with their businesses -- a winery, tinsmith shop, 
cornice factory, Italian community center, hotel and restaurant and others. 
When the City Council voted to close off the street, the mostly Anglo owners 
unsuccessfully complained all the way to the California Supreme Court about the 
closure. The mercado was unveiled on Easter weekend in 1930, amid a fanfare of 
dancing, singing, eating and public rejoicing. 
</P>
<P>
From its inception, the Old Plaza area, as well as Olvera Street, was 
multi-ethnic. The original settlers were Spaniards, African-Americans, Indians 
and mestizos. They had taken over from Gabrieleno Indians, who had probably 
lived there for centuries. While Latinos have been the dominant ethnic group in 
the 20th Century, the area's residents, shopkeepers and customers included 
Chinese, Germans, Italians, French, Portuguese, African-Americans and a 
smattering of Japanese. The Italians owned key properties and built the Italian 
Hall. The plaza area had been the center of Chinatown since the 1880s, and the 
large, surrounding Chinese population was still growing in the late 1920s, when 
Sterling first envisioned her enchanted mercado. 
</P>
<P>
The fates of both the Old Plaza and Olvera Street, even with its new mercado, 
have always rested in the hands of decision-makers in City Hall and corporate 
board rooms. In the 1920s, city officials considered replacing the plaza with a 
new civic center. They also come close to bulldozing the area for a new 
railroad terminal -- eventually built just east of the plaza, on Alameda 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
The construction of the rail terminal required the bulldozing of Chinatown, a 
collection of thriving businesses and a residential ghetto abutting the plaza's 
eastern perimeter. Because the Chinese residents lacked political clout, their 
businesses and community facilities were uprooted and moved to a new site a 
mile or two north -- where Sterling created a romanticized Chinese market off 
Ord Street. It was a bust commercially and burned down in 1938. 
</P>
<P>
The Olvera Street mercado, by contrast, became a commercial success and tourist 
attraction. Craft artists sold leather, glass, silver and wood goods to 
residents and tourists, which numbered close to a million annually. A reporter 
for the New York Times, writing on Aug. 3, 1930, said: "The Plaza is very old, 
as old as Lilith and Cain. The Mexicans founded it, and the Mexicans are still 
there. So are the Chinese, the Japanese, the Negroes, the low-caste whites and 
as many variants as the mathematical law of permutations and combinations will 
allow." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, other major events have shaped the history of the plaza and Olvera 
Street since the 1930s. In the 1940s and 1950s, historically significant 
buildings at the plaza's southern end were bulldozed to make room for a 
freeway. In 1953, outraged preservationists, including Sterling, successfully 
called for the area to be declared a state historic monument, so providing 
minimal protection for the remaining buildings. 
</P>
<P>
For a time, El Pueblo Park was run by a three-headed commission whose members 
-- state, county and city -- could never agree on anything important. The 
result: If it wasn't theme-park entrepreneurs seeking a quick buck, no matter 
the historical cost, it was architectural purists (save all buildings) vying 
with architectural romantics (impose a uniform Spanish colonial style on all 
buildings) for control over Olvera Street's look. Throughout, there was never 
enough money to preserve what was there. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing the history of Olvera Street and the Old Plaza alone will not calm the 
storm over what form the restoration of Olvera Street should take today, 
because the struggle is not so much about the past as it is about the present 
and the future. To some degree, Olvera Street and the plaza are what the viewer 
perceives them to be. But plainly, they are more than a popular downtown 
commercial attraction: They symbolize much of Los Angeles' past, especially its 
multi-ethnic origins, its Mexican roots and its celebration of historical 
romance.

BUSH ABANDONS VOW, CALLS FOR TAX INCREASE TO REDUCE DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So, President Bush has finally gone back on his "no new taxes" promise, and the 
only decision to be made is who must pay them. I propose that we wipe out the 
federal deficit by imposing on each American who voted for Bush in 1988 a 
onetime luxury tax, the luxury in this case being naivete. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its eminent fairness, my scheme is educational: An electorate 
forced to pay a cash price for its gullibility will eventually stop falling for 
campaign promises that are obviously impossible to keep.

I would think more of President Bush if he would just admit he lied to the 
nation. Instead of saying he plans to raise taxes, he now calls it "deficit 
reduction." 
</P>
<P>
Of course this will not hurt the rich, because even with higher taxes they 
still can maintain high standards of living. To the poor, higher taxes mean 
less food, clothing and shelter. Once more the rich get richer, and the poor, 
poorer. 
</P>
<P>
Now who do we start off taxing? The entitlement programs such as Medicare, 
Social Security, etc. Let the poor peasants try to survive on less. Then we tax 
part of Social Security, which people work all their lives to "earn" for their 
old age. Money which was already taxed, as they earned it. 
</P>
<P>
Again, let us tax all people to make up for the savings and loan frauds. People 
whose life savings were ripped off by the embezzlers who still maintain big 
homes, cars and perks. Why are they not in jail? President Bush, please answer 
this before you ask me to help pay off these robberies. Keep on taxing the 
middle class out of existence and see what that gets you! 
</P>
<P>
I have voted Republican all my life, but that, too, can change.

A PALESTINIAN SEASON OF GLOOM; 
</P>
<P>
COMING ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE, THE U.S. DECISION TO DROP ITS DIALOGUE WITH 
THE PLO JUST ADDS TO FRUSTRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MOHAMMAD TARBUSH, Mohammad Tarbush is a Geneva-based investment banker and 
chairman of the board of trustees of the United Palestinian Appeal, a 
Washington-based charity. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
America's decision to suspend talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization 
could not have come at a worse time for the Palestinians, particularly the more 
than 1 million who have endured 20 years of Israeli occupation. 
</P>
<P>
Their fears, inflamed by the massacre of seven Palestinian workers last month 
in the Israeli village of Rishon le Zion, were deepened by the formation of the 
most extremist government in Israel's 42-year history. (Indeed, the 
announcement of Yitzhak Shamir's new government caused several Palestinian 
leaders to cancel a hunger strike they had called to protest the massacre. "No 
one was paying attention," they complained.) 
</P>
<P>
The despair of those in the occupied territories is representative of the 
general feeling of frustration among Palestinians everywhere. And at least 
three sets of reasons have contributed to the accumulation of their fears: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Before the massacre, Israeli-Palestinian relations already were hopelessly 
deadlocked over the failure to get the peace process moving. The Bush 
Administration was perceived by the Palestinians as having failed to convince 
the Shamir government to adopt the American peace plan. While more than 50% of 
the Israeli public was expressing approval for direct negotiation with the PLO, 
no Israeli government emerged with the capability to translate that popular 
will into reality. Israeli leaders were seen as playing for time. If they could 
withstand American pressure for another year or so, the attention of the Bush 
Administration would turn to the next presidential elections. Or, if enough 
Soviet refugees could significantly change the demographic map of Israel, then 
followers of Likud and similar political parties would have an added argument 
for holding on to the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the intifada no longer stirs the Israeli conscience. The violent 
repression of stone-throwing Palestinian youth is accepted as the cost of 
living with the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Palestinians, aware of the diminishing symbolic value of their stones and 
occasional Molotov cocktails, looked to the PLO leadership outside the 
territories and to the Arab world for a serious mobilization of human and 
economic resources to help bring peace to their forsaken land. They found an 
Arab world still submerged in factional conflicts. Promises for financial aid 
remain largely unfulfilled. It is estimated that actual disbursements to 
Palestinians under occupation amounted to less than 20% of the $300 million 
annually pledged by Arab leaders at their 1988 Algiers summit, when they 
declared their commitment to support the Palestinian uprising with "all 
possible means." Last month's meeting of Arab leaders in Baghdad must have 
brought further discouragement. 
</P>
<P>
 -- As the Israeli novelist, Amos Oz, recently wrote in the Washington Post, 
the twin monsters, fanaticism and indifference, still roam around Israeli 
society. Many Palestinians feel that while Israeli leaders promptly condemned 
the Rishon le Zion murders, Israelis were largely indifferent. Their suspicions 
are confirmed by a report on the massacre published last month in the Israeli 
daily Yedioth Abronoth in which Israeli journalist Yigal Sarneh wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"I waited at the Rishon le Zion junction for two hours and did not see signs of 
sorrow on the faces of passers-by. An Israeli car blew its horn joyfully, the 
driver making a V-sign . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"At 11 o'clock, a tractor belonging to the municipality of Rishon le Zion 
arrived and with it an Arab young man carrying a broom. 'Where do I have to 
clean?' the tractor driver inquired. His companion, an inhabitant of Gaza, 
swept the blood away and bits of brain . . . at 11:15 a.m., an Israeli car, a 
red Autobianci, stopped by the murder scene. A happy looking youth got down. 
When he saw the blood patch on the red soil, he began to dance on it. 'Why only 
seven?' he said, laughing, before going away." 
</P>
<P>
So the Israeli-Palestinian situation is grim. Yet President Bush and Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev all but ignored this burning issue at their 
latest summit. The two leaders seemed to leave the ground clear to extremists 
of both sides, who must be having a field day. 
</P>
<P>
How long will it be before fanatics succeed in dragging the region into an 
all-out Arab-Israeli war? With the lethal and destructive weapons now 
available, the outcome can only be catastrophic. Indeed, can even the newly 
found and still fragile Soviet-American detente withstand a large-scale 
flare-up in such a sensitive and crucially important part of the world? 
</P>
<P>
America is uniquely qualified to contain this explosive situation. Enough 
Palestinian, Arab and, I am sure, Israeli leaders believe that Washington is 
sincerely searching for a peaceful settlement of this painful problem. But the 
composition of the new Israeli cabinet must make the American task even more 
difficult. Alas, the Bush Administration could not insist on the exclusion of 
known extremists from the new Israeli government the way it asked Yasser Arafat 
to dismiss an extremist from the PLO Executive Committee!

CYNICISM, THY NAME IS GEORGE BUSH; 
</P>
<P>
HE EATS HIS WORDS, AND NOW HIS ONLY IDEA -- TAXES ARE ICKY -- MAY BE NULLIFIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE F. WILL, George F. Will is a syndicated columnist in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Different people have different ideas of Heaven. Will it feature, as one poet 
supposed, eating pate de foie gras to the sound of trumpets? Perhaps. But for 
many Democrats, Heaven on Earth is watching George Bush eat his words to the 
sound of snickering from a cynical public that never thought he meant them. 
</P>
<P>
The cynicism of high-level Republicans here is such that they are happily 
proclaiming that Bush's changed position regarding taxes, even if the change is 
real, will not do real political damage, because most people assumed he was 
being cynical all along. And how do you suppose senior Republicans acquire such 
cynicism? Presidential leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"Read My Lips -- I lied," roared the New York Post, aflame with a rage 
altogether as bogus as Bush's too-tricky-by-half statement on taxes. Bush can 
neither speak effectively nor keep silent with dignity, so he made his 
carefully crafted, and crafty, tax statement in a terse written message. It was 
dropped into the press corps like a scrap of wastepaper. 
</P>
<P>
This method of communicating his message did nothing to make the message seem 
candid, which even a cursory reading reveals it isn't. Disdaining the 
leadership task of explaining himself, he said only that the statement "speaks 
for itself." Indeed it does, loudly and damningly. 
</P>
<P>
From sea to shining sea, the press took the bait. The Washington Post headline 
said Bush "calls for new taxes." The Los Angeles Times said he "backs a tax 
increase." Never have so many fat trout been hooked on such a small fly. And 
Democrats, allowing their wish to be the father of their thoughts, also read 
Bush's statement as saying what it ostentatiously does not say. 
</P>
<P>
It says "it is clear to me" that deficit reduction requires, in addition to 
spending cuts, "tax revenue increases." Democrats, who were busy demanding that 
Bush include the words "to me," evidently did not notice the labored nature of 
the locution "tax revenue increases." Such language signals a refusal to use 
other language. In this case the eschewed words are "tax increase." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly "tax revenue increases" can refer to increased yields from existing 
taxes as a result of economic growth; or the billions Bush anticipates from 
improved enforcement of existing taxes; or a short-term spurt of revenues from 
a cut in the capital-gains tax. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans are panicked by the tax issue, as a Democratic operative 
understands: "A lot of Republicans are going to have to wake up tomorrow and 
find another reason for running for office." Many Republicans are reassuring 
themselves that Bush has not said anything new, or that he is, with admirable 
deviousness, misleading everyone. Republicans are so dependent on taxophobia 
for their political identity, they are telling one another that Bush is a 
cynic. 
</P>
<P>
Chief of Staff John Sununu, Bush's Doberman, who flaunts his cynicism so that 
his employer's will be less noticeable, told some Republicans that Bush has not 
committed himself to anything new. Rep. Newt Gingrich, the Republican whip, 
says "(Bush) very explicitly didn't say 'raise taxes.' He said 'seek new 
revenue,' " so Bush's statement "didn't represent significant change in 
Republican policy." 
</P>
<P>
Given the signals of cynicism sent by Bush, Sununu and Gingrich, and so avidly 
seized upon by grateful Republicans, sensible Democrats assume Bush's statement 
is designed to lull Democrats into proposing tax increases. At that point Bush 
will deny accurately -- if not honorably -- that he ever said such a thing. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic realists think that the press, by misreading Bush's statement, may 
force him to mean what he flinched from saying. If not, Democrats will sit mute 
until Bush proposes a tax increase. If he does, his only idea -- taxes are icky 
-- will be nullified. 
</P>
<P>
If he does not, the deficit-reduction process will pit Democrats emphasizing 
defense cuts against Republicans emphasizing entitlement cuts: tanks against 
wheelchairs, closing military bases or closing rural hospitals. And Bush 
probably cannot have the grand passion of his life, a capital-gains cut, 
without proposing a higher income-tax rate for the rich. 
</P>
<P>
In Heaven, 'tis said, all will be made plain. How tiresome. If everything is 
made plain, what will there be to talk about? Such a Heaven sounds hellish. For 
now, in Washington, nothing is clear, except that cynicism is realism.

STILL THE OLD SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE HALE, chairman of the Black Business Assn. of Los Angeles, commented on 
the prospects of black business expansion in Southern California. He told The 
Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Considering the obstacles, the state of black business is fine. Opportunities 
are limited because the old system -- a system that usually denies blacks 
access to capital and contracts -- is still in place. 
</P>
<P>
Access to capital affords you an opportunity to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the major banks and (financial institutions) have hired more blacks 
over the last few years, but they haven't been placed in positions that give 
them full lending authority. 
</P>
<P>
Major corporations also have more black employees. However, corporations don't 
have many blacks in the contracting and purchasing departments -- and that's 
where the hard decisions of selecting vendors and suppliers are made. A chief 
executive officer might try to sensitize his people at the lower end to the 
policies of affirmative action. However, the people (in purchasing departments) 
will resist those efforts. Until you change the corporate culture and until you 
change the structure of power at the bottom, there will be always be deterrents 
to access to mainstream business.

SCULPT THIS INTO YOUR PIPE AND SMOKE IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE WESCHLER, Lawrence Weschler is a staff writer at the New Yorker 
whose most recent book is A Miracle, a Universe: Settling Accounts With 
Torturers (Pantheon, 1990). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What follows is a sort of modest proposal for seeing our way clear of the 
current NEA debacle. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, though, a bit of analysis. Apparently we've come to the point in 
our national political life where it is seriously being argued that if the 
grant for a particular artist or artwork or exhibition could conceivably be 
deemed objectionable to a single citizen -- or a small minority of citizens, or 
even a sizeable plurality -- well, then, that grant must not be awarded, since 
a fraction (admittedly a minuscule fraction) of his or her or their tax dollars 
could then be seen to be promoting such work. 
</P>
<P>
This is a novel theory. I notice, for example, that such logic was never 
applied to funding for the Stealth bomber or aid to the regimes in El Salvador 
and Guatemala or any number of other such initiatives that I and many of my 
fellow citizens find obscene. By the logic applied to the National Endowment 
for the Arts, none of those programs should have been allowed to proceed. But 
OK. Let's assume that (astonishingly) that logic is now going to be allowed to 
hold sway in the coming debate on NEA funding. 
</P>
<P>
There's a simple solution: Currently the very first item on everyone's standard 
1040 tax form reads: "Presidential Election Campaign: Do you want $1 to go to 
this fund? Yes? No?" And there's a little note over to the side: "Checking 
'yes' will not change your tax or reduce your refund." So, fine, let's simply 
divide the upcoming NEA appropriation. The vast majority of the authorization, 
the noncontroversial portion that everyone pretty much agrees on, let's just 
pass outright. As for the rest, let's add two new boxes to the top of 
everybody's next 1040 form. The first would read: "National Art Fund: Do you 
want $1 of these taxes to go to a fund for art and artists, which would be 
awarded on the basis of traditional peer review criteria without regard to 
specific content?" (followed by the proviso as to how checking "yes" would in 
no way affect one's tax liability). This way, nobody would be seeing his or her 
moral qualms abused; such people's money wouldn't come into it and their 
opinions would have no standing. 
</P>
<P>
The second new box would read: "North Carolina Tobacco Farm Subsidy." Some of 
Jesse Helm's most influential backers could expect to garner precisely as many 
dollars (and not a penny more) as there are citizens who don't consider that 
particular boondoggle to be a continuing national scandal.

THE STAR CAFE BY MARY CAPONEGRO (SCRIBNERS: $16.95; 180 PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine a time when all life is extinct, and the scalpels in hospital operating 
rooms continue to slice as if there were human hands to wield them. Imagine a 
time when Madonna in a pointed metal bra writhes through a sexual pantomime, 
all sexuality extinct. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine a time when David Lynch makes a television series where the dead-moon 
face of a girl and the strange gyrations of a dwarf imitate loss and mystery, 
in a context where loss and mystery are equally extinct. A time when Peter 
Greenaway films greed, lust, sadism and decay in a restaurant or an 
architecture exhibit, so that they are vivid and immediate, yet as distant as 
radio signals from another planet. 
</P>
<P>
Or a time when Mary Caponegro, author of the short pieces that I will touch 
upon later, writes of a mother-ridden daughter who bursts into flames and rises 
from them like a phoenix, of a woman and a beautiful young man who disappears 
as he makes love to her, and of another young man who turns into a bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
Except for that first flourish, of course, there is no need to imagine such a 
time -- it is now. To varying degrees, these examples suggest a style in the 
contemporary arts for which the word movement or school or even trend would be 
too definite. Leading or cutting edge would be too pretentious, since now as 
always, art is cutting several ways at once. 
</P>
<P>
Where this style does cut, though, it does not bleed. This is its point: It 
cuts to show that there is no blood anymore, or if there is blood, it does not 
circulate because there is no heart to pump it. It is another stage in the line 
of post-modernism -- that estrangement between style and essence. It is the 
child of camp, and at war with its filial likeness; fierce instead of languid. 
It is surrealism's grandchild and, as happens across skipped generations, the 
affinities are striking even though the difference is profound. 
</P>
<P>
Surrealism and its offshoots -- Dada and the strange artistic/philosophical 
movement called Situationism -- were a powerful reversal of order. The power 
lay partly in the reversal; in the artist's vision, wit and audacity. In larger 
part, though, it lay in the power of the thing reversed. Dali's famous limp 
clocks hanging from a tree were partly memorable because clocks and pocket 
watches were so much the symbol of centuries of scientific and industrial 
self-confidence. Each night they wound up their owners to tick along through 
the following day, until the self-confidence deadlocked and died in World War 
I. 
</P>
<P>
The Situationist notion that bombing Amiens Cathedral would be just as much a 
work of art as building it depended, of course, on the immensity of Amiens. 
Marcel Duchamp's mustache on Leonardo's the Mona Lisa would have meant nothing 
had it been a mustache on the portrait of an unknown by an unknown. Magritte's 
"This is not a pipe," scrawled under a burnished representation of a pipe, was 
also a game of hide and seek, of absence and presence. It was a pipe, that 
drawing of a pipe, but then again it wasn't: It was only a drawing. And what 
did "This" refer to? The picture, the sentence under it or the picture as 
undermined by the sly sentence? And although the effect did not depend upon the 
pipe's eminence, it did depend on the tension between the message and the 
incontestable presence of the object it denied. 
</P>
<P>
By such ironic means did surrealism's subversive negation become a kind of 
affirmation, all the same, of the value of civilization's monuments. It raged 
-- comically, sardonically, to be sure -- against their decline. A child will 
rage at a parent who gets ill or goes out. "You are not my mother," it will 
tell its mother as she heads for the door. This is not a pipe, Magritte tells a 
pipe. (Was it his father's?) 
</P>
<P>
But, as with the man given one wish, such power is a one-time thing. Had some 
Situationist actually bombed Amiens, there would be little excitement in 
periodically making the rubble bounce. After Mona Lisa gets her mustache, what 
happens when all the other portraits have mustaches? Dali's limp clocks 
contained time until he emptied them; what interest does a limp clock have if 
we are no longer harnessed to its ticking? A fun-house distorting mirror 
reveals something about us that an ordinary mirror won't, but it requires an 
undistorted visage to work upon. 
</P>
<P>
A Greenaway, a Lynch, a Madonna, and writers -- in different degrees -- such as 
Robert Coover, Ellen Akins, Joanna Scott, Paul Auster and Caponegro have rubble 
to bounce, hirsute Mona Lisas to decorate, bent clocks to bend, and no reality 
to discover and bring before their distorting mirrors other than one that is 
already distorted. 
</P>
<P>
What they produce is an imagery that is highly wrought, brilliantly executed 
but only seemingly dramatic. We get climaxes that exist by themselves, with 
nothing leading up to or away from them. We get moments that tremble with 
revelation and reveal nothing. There is sensation without experience. There are 
truncated epiphanies, denouements without stories, emotional and aesthetic 
bottom lines with no columns of figures above them. 
</P>
<P>
The icy quality of the dead face in "Twin Peaks," and the weaving dance of the 
dwarf, seem to be windows on a mystery greater than the banal story, but the 
windows are trompe l'oeuil. The severed ear, sexual abuse and other violence of 
"Blue Velvet" are neither materially real, nor do they symbolize corruption or 
state it through extremity; they are a witty, breathtaking play of images and 
symbols for their own sake. They are gifted cousins to the caped figure against 
the sunset in a sherry ad, or the look of bruised distress in an ad for jeans. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Bunuel's films, with all their surreal extremes, stretched our idea of who 
we are. The distorting mirror applied to a real face. Peter Greenaway's films, 
heavily influenced by Bunuel, use an imagery that recalls his, with quite a 
different effect. In Greenaway's "Belly of an Architect," for example, we have 
all kinds of striking signifiers -- a furiously lubricious Roman gentleman, the 
architect's monstrous stomachache, the purposely awkward and amateurish 
delivery by the actress playing his wife, an ambiguous little boy with a 
gyroscope -- that signify nothing but themselves. Except, of course, the 
impossibility of signifying anything else. 
</P>
<P>
This style is, in its own way (as always with real artists), a statement about 
reality. But it is a statement in a foreign language, with the stresses in the 
wrong place and erratic sibilants. Deliberately so, of course. Reality is a 
foreign country, if indeed it exists at all. 
</P>
<P>
It is unusual on this page to preface mention of an individual book with such a 
long general consideration, and perhaps to skimp it in the process. Caponegro's 
voice and vision are talented and individual. If I have placed her so 
extensively in a context, it is not to diminish the individuality but, on the 
contrary, to make it more apparent. 
</P>
<P>
The four pieces in "The Star Cafe" all have some of the qualities I have 
referred to, though they have others, as well. Three of the four, in fact, 
apply their estranged effects to a common and substantial theme. They deal with 
woman and man: The present woman, the absent man; the centered woman, the 
wandering man; the waxing woman, the waning man. Feminist, certainly, but 
feminist art, not feminist polemics. 
</P>
<P>
"Tales From the Next Village" is not polemical, but it is rather pat. It is a 
group of brief fables told in a traditional Chinese manner that seems, like 
19th-Century Western chinoiserie, extremely precious. In one, a young man who 
has heard his mother sing of the silkiness of mermaids, goes to the sea to 
catch one, and is drowned, silkily. In another, a woman famous for a loving 
husband, is widowed. Everyone is sure she will take another man; instead, she 
lies down in the fields and opens her legs to the rain, free from the 
oppressiveness that goes even with devotion. In a third, a hunter who abandons 
his wife all day to hunt pheasants comes home that night empty-handed. The 
wife's cupboard is stacked high with the birds, who have obligingly flown in 
and arranged themselves in handy rows. 
</P>
<P>
In the title story, a young woman, alarmed by a noise outside her apartment, 
follows it downstairs and finds herself in a cafe where the owner is preparing 
a drink in a huge and noisy blender. She confides her fears; he comforts her; 
they make love. As they do, he fades from sight, though she still feels him 
pounding along in solipsist excitement as her own correspondingly dwindles. He 
reappears; she asks to use the bathroom and chides him when he tells her there 
are no proper facilities for women. He is offended and disappears once more; 
she goes into a much more arousing bout of sex by herself. 
</P>
<P>
In summary, this sounds crude, and the moral all too clear: Men take pleasure 
in women when they are fragile, disappear within their own pleasure, and vanish 
completely when the women assert themselves. In fact, "Star Cafe" is told 
delicately, with wit and mystery. There is something disconnected, though, 
between the message and the faintly surreal, dreamlike devices by which it 
proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
"Sebastian," novella-length, relates the decline and fall, in the course of a 
day's errands, of an anxiously meticulous young man whose two passions are 
words and his fiancee's body. In playing with words and adjusting them with 
fussy pedantry, Sebastian finds security in a perplexing world; he finds a 
different kind of security making burrowing and voracious love with Sarah. 
</P>
<P>
Her flamboyant beauty troubles him, though; so does her independence as an 
artisan-jeweler. Love for her is part of opening to the world; for him it is a 
refuge. On the day in question, he is frustrated and eventually undone by a 
chain of mishaps. Not only does he find his gas station and dry cleaner briefly 
closed, but the signs announcing this are improperly worded or badly spelled. 
</P>
<P>
Waiting for the cleaners to open, he is beset by a series of odd incidents and 
disquiets. He stands so long in one spot that would-be bus passengers deposit 
ashes and trash on him, and someone uses him for a bike rack. Strolling, he is 
obsessed by the queues at the post office in the bank, and by the shape of 
envelopes and bank cards. "Everything's coming up rectangles for Sebastian." 
Alternately, he is haunted by phrases from Aristotle. 
</P>
<P>
He goes to Sarah's workshop and tries to get her to drop what she's doing and 
make love. She refuses and sends him away; when he returns for another try, he 
gets stuck in the elevator. Not only are men threatened by women's 
independence, but the threat imprisons them. 
</P>
<P>
Caponegro aims to use her surreal eruptions -- giant blenders, disappearing 
lovers, bus-stop metamorphoses, the ominous prevalence of rectangles, Aristotle 
as a kind of floating, speaking bust -- to serve her theme in the older, 
distorting-mirror fashion. Yet they don't quite serve, they break off; they 
shiver, like Madonna, in disembodied lust. They bounce like rubble.

COMING OUT UNDER FIRE THE HISTORY OF GAY MEN AND WOMEN IN WORLD WAR TWO BY 
ALLAN BERUBE (THE FREE PRESS: $22.95; 377 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-02-903100-1) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Neil Miller, Miller's book, In Search of Gay America: Women and Men in a 
Time of Change, was recently reprinted in paperback by Harper &amp; Row. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In "Coming Out Under Fire," Allan Berube's fascinating history of the lives of 
gays and lesbians during World War II, a Marine corporal recalls the night his 
division, stationed on a South Pacific island, was strafed by Japanese planes 
in a surprise attack. As part of his duties, the corporal, along with two of 
his mates, would sometimes entertain fellow GIs with drag impersonations of 
Carmen Miranda and the Andrews Sisters. When the Japanese aircraft appeared on 
that occasion, the men were in the middle of their "Three Little Sisters" 
routine. "(We) three guys in dresses jumped into this gigantic foxhole with 
about 500 Marines in it," the corporal told Berube many years later. "The three 
of us stood there looking at these guys saying, 'I don't know how the hell we 
got into this!' " 
</P>
<P>
There were other gay and lesbian GIs who probably wondered how they "got into 
this," as well, but for different reasons. Among this group were the 9,000 men 
and women dishonorably discharged on the grounds of being homosexual. Many -- 
in some cases despite distinguished military service -- wound up spending part 
of the war in psycho wards or in "queer" brigs or stockades. When they returned 
home, they faced social stigma and found themselves ineligible for GI loans and 
other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
If one accepts the accuracy of the Kinsey reports, somewhere between 650,000 
and 1,650,000 gay male GIs (and a smaller number of lesbian WAACs and WAVES) 
served in the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II. Nonetheless, the subject 
of homosexuality has been almost entirely ignored in documentation of the 
period. (Studs Terkel's oral history, "The Good War," is a notable exception.) 
Self-educated historian Berube, who has been involved in the community-based 
San Francisco Lesbian and Gay History Project, spent 10 years interviewing 
homosexual veterans, unearthing letters between gay GIs, and rummaging through 
government archives. (In this last effort he often encountered resistance if 
not outright denial of access to material.) 
</P>
<P>
The result is a rich social history that argues that much of contemporary 
homosexual identity, sense of community, and activism had its origin in the 
experience of gay men and women in World War II. At the same time, the book is 
a bureaucratic and political history that methodically traces the evolution of 
the U.S. military's policy that to this day excludes homosexuals from its 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
According to Berube, the U.S. military's World War II policy regarding gays and 
lesbians was originally put forth as humane and reformist in nature. The U.S. 
Armed Forces had traditionally no official policy of excluding homosexuals. 
Regulations simply labeled the act of sodomy as criminal, and military 
personnel convicted of that offense could be sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
But at the begining of the war -- on the advice of psychiatrists eager, Berube 
believes, to increase the influence of their profession -- the armed forces 
introduced the notion of the homosexual as a personality type unfit for 
military service. Gays and lesbians were viewed as "sexual psychopaths," a 
threat to morale and discipline; they were to be screened out or discharged 
dishonorably without trial. As a result, the military services developed "an 
expanding administrative apparatus for managing homosexual personnel that 
relied on diagnosis, hospitalization, surveillance, interrogation, discharge, 
administrative appeal, and mass indoctrination." 
</P>
<P>
Despite this approach, the military's record was characterized by ambivalence, 
especially in view of manpower (and womanpower) needs. Berube notes that 
lesbians were generally left alone. No processes were adopted to screen them 
out until late in the war. The 1944 complaint of the mother of a WAAC private, 
about goings-on at Fort Ogelthorpe, Ga., resulted in a month of secret hearings 
on homosexuality in the Women's Army Corps. In thousands of other cases, GIs 
assumed to be lesbian or gay were steered to stereotypically homosexual jobs -- 
the women to duties such as motor vehicle operation and mechanics; the men to 
service as clerks, medics, hospital corpsmen, chaplains' assistants, and female 
impersonators in musical revues and morale-boosting shows. 
</P>
<P>
Acceptance in stereotypical roles was not the only kind of acceptance 
homosexuals received. For men, the dangers and pressures of combat forged close 
relationships that transcended sexual orientation. In one particularly moving 
account, a combat veteran recalls a man embracing and kissing his wounded lover 
who was being shipped back to the States, as other soldiers looked on 
sympathetically. The parting was "a little distilled moment out of time," the 
vet noted, "when the men's prejudices were suspended." 
</P>
<P>
But the reality was that wartime did not always mean a suspension of 
prejudices, especially when orders came from the top. Soldiers told of being 
locked in gay stockades and forced to walk past thousands of jeering soldiers 
on their way to the mess hall, of having to wear tags that read, "Psychopathia 
sexualis." Transcripts uncovered by the author reveal a military investigator 
at Fort Ogelthorpe voyeuristically asking a lesbian corporal: "Do you (and your 
lover) kiss long clinging kisses?" and "Do you feel various parts of one 
another's bodies?" 
</P>
<P>
"Coming Out Under Fire" is a passionate book without ever being a polemical 
one. Berube does an admirable job of portraying the wartime period and 
supporting his theories with official documentation and colorful eyewitness 
accounts. He is less successful depicting the many veterans he interviewed for 
the book; they largely fail to come alive as distinct individuals. And it might 
have been helpful to give the reader a better sense of the prewar experiences 
of gay men and lesbians as a context in which to place the wartime years. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Berube makes a convincing case that by bringing large numbers of 
previously isolated gays and lesbians into contact with one another, 
establishing port cities as concentrations of homosexual bars and social life, 
even by labeling homosexuals as a "personality type" and persecuting them, 
World War II created the climate in which the gay liberation movements of the 
'60s and '70s were able to emerge. The Mattachine Society, the first U.S. gay 
rights organization, was formed by a group of veterans in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the one institution where gay and lesbian activism has failed to 
make much of an impact has been the armed forces. There, little, if anything, 
has changed since 1945. With the military's exclusionary policies under 
mounting criticism, "Coming Out Under Fire" is an especially timely and 
important book. One wishes the Pentagon top brass would read it.

THE BOOK TRADE: THE CASE OF THE BOOKLESS BOOK PARTY: A CAUTIONARY TALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the 1989 convention of the American Booksellers Assn. in Washington, proud 
officials of Henry Holt &amp; Co. paraded Edwin Meese around like a prize . . 
well, like a prize author -- or at least future author. 
</P>
<P>
The former White House chief of staff and attorney general from the Reagan 
Administration had just signed with Holt to write his memoirs. Meese's book 
promised to be the latest in a seemingly nonstop series of tell-all tomes by 
top-ranking members of Ronald Reagan's White House. The prospect of an 
insider's view from Meese, whose association with Reagan dated back to the 
statehouse in Sacramento, had editors from Holt grinning over cocktails and 
canapes at a party they threw to announce the Meese mission. 
</P>
<P>
But a year later, instead of circulating advance copies of Meese's book at the 
1990 ABA convention, Holt was sadly confirming that the project had been 
scrapped. The six-figure Meese deal had crashed, officials said, and his 
contract had been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing was ever delivered," Holt editor-in-chief William Strachan said in an 
interview. "The deadline for the manuscript came and went. We had received 
nothing, and further, had no prospect of receiving anything." 
</P>
<P>
"It was clear we were not going to get the behind-the-scenes book we were 
after," Greg Hamlin, Holt's vice president for sales and marketing, said. "When 
we didn't get what we wanted, instead of going back and forth for years, we 
decided to stop." 
</P>
<P>
With so much publicity and anticipation attached to the initial signing of the 
Meese book, its cancellation was bound to receive equal attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually," Hamlin said, "it's much quieter." 
</P>
<P>
But the decision to abandon the project was by no means unusual. Even as the 
dust was dying down from the Meese cancellation, for example, Houghton Mifflin 
was bowing out of a $315,000-advance deal for another Washington book, this one 
about the Securities and Exchange Commission. Far from a rarity in publishing, 
it turns out, cancellation is in fact a growing trend -- and, editors say, an 
increasingly disturbing one. 
</P>
<P>
Publishers say that the increase in cancellations can be traced to a kind of 
buying fever that has swept through publishing in recent years. Everyone is 
looking for the "hot" book, they say. Auctions often take on a frenzied pace 
where the substance of a potential book may be lost to the topicality of its 
subject. Agents are also more and more likely to attach time limits to projects 
they submit, creating a sense of urgency that may not be entirely warranted. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, say editors who have themselves succumbed to this kind of pressure, many 
of those same books will have only the scantiest of proposals -- perhaps as 
little as a few paragraphs. With no sample chapters, no outline and no 
partially completed manuscript, the author and publisher may have only a 
slender thread of agreement about what kind of book is about to be undertaken. 
As publishers point out, the potential for misunderstanding under these 
circumstances is enormous. 
</P>
<P>
"We buy books in the heat of excitement from proposals, and sometimes not even 
from proposals, sometimes from conversations, or snippets of conversations, or 
just a vague idea," an editor in New York who did not want to be identified 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Another editor, also asking for anonymity because she had recently been 
associated with a canceled book, echoed the idea that a mood of pressure and a 
tendency toward abbreviated proposals was making cancellations more common. 
</P>
<P>
"The shorter the proposal, the less formed the book, the more potential there 
is for problems," this editor said. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you have? You have a little wisp of smoke of a book. It's just really 
a gleam in the eye of the writer, the publisher and the agent. What happens is 
that books take a while to write, and then they take a while to publish. The 
less you have on paper, the easier it is for things to go wrong." 
</P>
<P>
But many writers and agents offer their own views of what happens when a book 
is canceled. "I think more books are being canceled because publishers are 
tightening their belts," one agent said. She said that while books with big 
advances were subject to cancellation as economy moves, so were 
moderate-advance books -- books in the $15,000 to $40,000 range -- that 
publishers might see as "marginal," and thus expendable. 
</P>
<P>
Authors also can find themselves and their books in trouble if the editor who 
has been working with the author leaves the house, leaving no one there to 
champion it. Some editors do "take their authors with them" when they move to 
other houses. But just as often, an editor leaves his books behind when he 
leaves a house. 
</P>
<P>
A novelist who had this experience found herself working with a new editor 
assigned to her project. 
</P>
<P>
"This woman had no interest in my book. She didn't understand my book," the 
novelist said. After several rewrites were rejected, the novelist bought back 
her own contract and is attempting to sell the book elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, authors and agents alike do concede that a book might be canceled when 
the publisher considers the manuscripts unsatisfactory -- and not worth the 
work it might take to make it satisfactory. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a fairly unpleasant situation," an agent said. "No one likes to think 
about that one." 
</P>
<P>
A further complication that sometimes contributes to cancellations is a 
laissez-faire attitude among some editors. Many writers do their work in 
isolation and even bristle when asked for evidence of their work. An editor may 
go a year, or more, without having seen a word of an author's project. When the 
book does come in, if it does, it may bear no resemblance to what was 
originally discussed or contracted. 
</P>
<P>
"You need checkpoints," the editor who was still smarting from a cancellation 
said. "Especially with nonfiction, there has to be close communication with an 
author along the way." 
</P>
<P>
But with writers pressured to produce their works quickly, those checkpoints 
are sometimes overlooked. Or, an author may convince an editor that the book 
will make no sense in chunks or installments. The emphasis on coming out with a 
whole book, and quickly, may lead to the sloppiness that results in 
cancellations, some editors say. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the proposed contents of a book are carefully spelled out in a 
contract, "what you signed up for versus what you get on delivery" may be two 
very different things, Doubleday publisher Stephen Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
"It comes down to a subjective editorial decision," Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
Time limits can also figure in the cancellation equation. Most publishers 
readily extend a time limit for an author, but if a topic is highly 
time-sensitive, this may not be possible. If the book is two years late, long 
after a particular subject has passed from the public interest, the book may 
have to be shelved. 
</P>
<P>
But as one agent noted, time elements are sometimes only a partial reason for 
cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
"I recently had a book canceled because it was very, very late, and because it 
was not what the editor wanted," this agent said. "Very, very late and very, 
very excellent has never stopped a publisher from publishing." 
</P>
<P>
Most authors receive a payment upon signing a contract to write a book. 
Subsequent payments vary according to the contract. Unless not one single word 
has been delivered, it may be difficult for a publisher to recover an initial 
payment when a book is canceled. 
</P>
<P>
One publisher said that although cancellation is not a happy event for anyone, 
most agents and authors are reasonable about working out the financial 
arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Meese book, "the way we had structured the contract, there 
was not a lot of money that went out to begin with," Greg Hamlin said. 
</P>
<P>
Meese, like any other canceled author, is free to try to sell his idea 
elsewhere. Canceled books often make the rounds, and frequently show up with 
the imprint of a rival house. In fact cancellations are such a common 
occurrence that unless there is some major scandal or a huge amount of money 
involved, no one really blinks. 
</P>
<P>
"If you go around pointing your fingers and smirking, it will probably be you 
the next time," Strachan said. 
</P>
<P>
At Holt, "we would have loved to have gotten a behind-the-scenes look at the 
Reagan White House," Greg Hamlin said. "We would have loved to have known what 
really happened in those meetings Meese had with William Casey. But we knew it 
was a long shot." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, "In retrospect, if we had known what was going to 
happen, we would have thrown a cocktail party for another author."

OUTTAKES: WATERED DOWN?

<P>
Thanks, but no thanks. That's what the U.S. Navy first told Orion Pictures, 
when the studio inquired about Naval cooperation in the making of its 
action-adventure, "Navy SEAL." 
</P>
<P>
The reason: the script -- in which the elite Sea Air and Land combat team goes 
into action in the Middle East -- didn't pass muster. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Michael Sherman, director of the Navy Office of Information, West, tells 
us that, as originally written, Charlie Sheen's maverick-type character would 
have been court-martialed. "None of us would have put up with that kind of 
behavior from a junior officer," Sherman says. "He was belligerent and 
unprofessional beyond the bounds of professionalism." 
</P>
<P>
After script revisions that resulted in a "toned-down, more believable" 
character, the U.S. Navy agreed to provide "limited cooperation," allowing the 
film crew to shoot for three days at the Naval base at Norfolk, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Although the film takes dramatic license with certain aspects of the Navy -- 
including truncated SEAL training time and relationships among the officers 
that are "a little fast and loose" -- Sherman says "there are no hard feelings 
between the Navy and Orion." 
</P>
<P>
Next week, in fact, the Navy will put on a special SEAL demonstration for the 
press, tied to the film's July 20 opening. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we get some benefits from any movie that depicts the military," 
Sherman explains. "After 'The Hunt for Red October' came out, there was 
interest in working on submarines. With 'SEAL,' I'm sure we'll be hearing from 
kids who are good in the water." Pat H. Broeske

Nancy Kwan was just 18, studying dance with England's Royal Ballet School, when 
she was spotted by producer Ray Stark, who tested her and gave her the starring 
role of a free-spirited Hong Kong prostitute who captivates artist William 
Holden in "The World of Susie Wong" (1960). She followed it the next year with 
the hit musical "Flower Drum Song" and became one of Hollywood's most visible 
Asian actresses. 
</P>
<P>
"Both roles were very bold," Wong recalls today. "I've never really played a 
demure little Asian." 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese-English Kwan spent the '60s commuting between film roles 
</P>
<P>
in America and Europe, but faded from view in the West when she returned to her 
native Hong Kong in 1972 to be with her critically ill father. 
</P>
<P>
Then divorced from an Austrian hotelier, with a young son, Kwan intended to 
stay a year -- but wound up staying a decade. As managing director of her own 
production company, she produced and directed dozens of commercials for the 
Southeast Asia market. She also acted in a spate of films made for Southeast 
Asian audiences, including a 1977 movie, "Fear," that introduced her to 
filmmaker Norbert Meisel, the man she now calls "my other half." 
</P>
<P>
She returned to the States in 1979 so that her teen-age son, Bernie Pock, could 
complete his education here. (A martial-arts master who speaks fluent Chinese, 
he's now a stunt coordinator and actor.) 
</P>
<P>
Since returning, Kwan's appeared on numerous TV series and co-starred in the 
NBC miniseries "Noble House" and the recent CBS TV movie "Miracle Landing." 
She's politically active as the spokeswoman for the Asian American Voters 
Coalition, and touts a beauty product, Oriental Pearl Cream, in TV spots. 
</P>
<P>
She's also about to get back into the movies -- this time as a producer as well 
as actress. 
</P>
<P>
The project, "Endless Voyage," set during the fall of Saigon, is an interracial 
love story about an American woman who's been separated from her Vietnamese 
husband. Kwan co-stars as the United Nations delegate who attempts to reunite 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Kwan and writer/director Charles Wallace have already scouted locations in 
Thailand, and have secured government permission to film in Vietnam after a 
visit to Hanoi. Budgeted at $5 million-$6 million for Phoenix International 
Prods., "Endless Voyage" may be the first American movie to shoot in Vietnam 
since the war's end. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that our filming there will be another bridge to peace," says Kwan. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, she's seen many changes regarding Hollywood's treatment of 
Asian performers. "When I first came here, it seemed I was the only Asian 
actress. When there weren't Asian roles for me, they cast me as an American 
Indian. I also played French and Italian! That wouldn't happen today -- and I'm 
glad. Hollywood is more sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
But there's still progress to be made, Kwan adds. 
</P>
<P>

Martin Landau plays a painter frustrated by his inability to create an inspired 
work of art in Christara Pictures' "The Color of Evening." Tamara Lynn Roth and 
Hesper Anderson's screenplay is based on a novel by Robert Nathan (whose 
"Portrait of Jenny" and "The Bishop's Wife" were turned into films in the 
'40s). Writer-producer Stephen Thomas Stafford rolls cameras in Southern 
California July 16. 
</P>
<P>
Apollonia will star opposite martial artist Larry Tatum as an undercover agent 
in Red Rock Productions' "Thunder and Lightning," a spy thriller with a martial 
arts setting. Debra Thornton and Audrey Meadows co-star for producer Jan 
Leonard and director John Stewart. Production begins Sept. 20 in Baja 
California, Mexico, and L.A. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Pelikan will play the only adult role in Columbia's "Return to the Blue 
Lagoon," which is getting under way in Fiji. She plays a young mother, who is 
put to sea with her infant daughter and the surviving male child from the 
previous film when cholera breaks out on the rescue ship. Milla Jovovich, a 
Russian-born model, and Brian Krause will play the two young people stranded on 
an uncharted island in a film that sounds more like a remake than a sequel. 
William A. Graham will direct the Leslie Stevens screenplay for Price 
Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Christopher Atkins, who co-starred with Brooke Shields in the 
original "Blue Lagoon," has written his first feature script, "Fire, Ice and My 
Wife," which he'll star in for Florida-based Quest Studios. The film is 
described as a light-hearted look at today's romantic relationships. 
Producer-director Hugh Parks launches production in August in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Collin Bernsen, younger brother of Corbin and son of Jeanne Cooper, who has 
appeared in the day-time soap "The Young and the Restless" for 17 years, joins 
the cast of "Hangfire," currently filming in the L.A. area. The film, which 
also stars Brad Davis, Kim Delaney, George Kennedy, Jan-Michael Vincent, Lyle 
Alzado and Lou Ferrigno, is being directed by Peter Maris and produced by Brad 
Krevoy and Steven Stabler for the Motion Picture Corp. of America. 
</P>
<P>
David Rasche and Joseph Mahar join Sheryl Lee Ralph and Glenn Plummer in 
Hollywood Pictures' "Randall &amp; Juliet" (expect a title change) as 
back-stabbing corporate executives. However, Richard Dreyfuss left the picture 
last week, citing "creative differences." His departure will force 
writer-director Coline Serreau and producer Laurence Marks to postpone the July 
9 start date for the Buena Vista release while they cast a new male lead. The 
film will probably go in September. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, honors for the best movie title of the week go to writer-director 
Philippe Mora's "Pterodactyl Woman From Brentwood." Brion James and John Dennis 
Johnston will star in this satire of Brentwood Yuppie life. The title role is 
still uncast. Mora and his co-producer Michael Duffy will launch production in 
late September for the Really Unbelievable Picture Co. in -- where else? -- 
Brentwood. KIRK HONEYCUTT

ON THE RECORD: WALTER PISTON ET AL: NATIVE GENIUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The name of Walter Piston (1894-1976) isn't frequently encountered after 
leaving college, where his textbooks on harmony and orchestration are among the 
student's indispensable guides. Piston's compositions are accordingly tarred as 
academic, as if writing texts and teaching at a university -- Piston was the 
bulwark of the Harvard composition faculty for three decades -- were synonymous 
with lack of creative imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Piston was not only an inspiration to his students, a glittering, heterogenous 
assemblage that included Elliott Carter, Irving Fine, Harold Shapero and 
Leonard Bernstein, but was himself an important creative force, as the current 
recorded examination (live performances remain rare) of his sizable output 
indicates. 
</P>
<P>
As part of their ongoing American music recording project -- still, at this 
writing, handsomely supported by the National Endowment for the Arts -- Gerard 
Schwarz and the Seattle Symphony are turning their attention to Piston's eight 
symphonies, with Nos. 2 (1943) and 6 (1955) and the 1941 Sinfonietta making up 
the initial release (Delos 3074). 
</P>
<P>
The Second is a terrific piece, emotionally spare, yet full of lively rhythms 
and some ear-sticking tunes. The brilliant orchestration and all that 
contrapuntal activity may be textbook stuff in certain respects, but Piston 
wears his erudition lightly -- and he did, after all, write the book. 
</P>
<P>
The Sixth is more self-consciously grand and showily orchestrated, but with a 
gregarious, sharp-witted scherzo/second movement to balance the rhetorical tone 
of the outer movements. 
</P>
<P>
Both symphonies are projected with optimum clarity, affection and skill by 
Schwarz and his responsive Seattle musicians, while the third work on the 
program, the tough, dark Sinfonietta (1941) has Schwarz leading the New York 
Chamber Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
Samuel Barber, like Piston, spent a period of time studying with Nadia 
Boulanger in Paris during the '20s, but, unlike the clear-eyed Piston, he 
became fully immersed in the spirit of European Romanticism while there. 
</P>
<P>
That Romanticism comes to full flower in the 1948 "Knoxville, Summer of 1915" 
settings of deep-South nostalgic texts by James Agee. "Knoxville" -- is there a 
more lushly lyrical vocal work in all of American music? -- is for the first 
time recorded by non-native forces: British soprano Jill Gomez, in a 
performance of gorgeous, relaxed sensuality, with the City of London Sinfonia 
under Richard Hickox (Virgin Classics 90766). 
</P>
<P>
The title of Leonard Bernstein's 1988 "Arias and Barcarolles" originated much 
earlier, in an approving comment made about Gershwin by President Eisenhower 
after Bernstein had played that composer's music at the White House: "I like 
music with a theme, not all of them arias and barcarolles." (One assumes he 
meant tune rather than theme.) 
</P>
<P>
Bernstein's appealing composition has both tunes and a theme, that of love 
(which sounds thin when so blandly stated), projected largely in dialogue form, 
to (mainly) his own texts. 
</P>
<P>
Its first recording (Koch 7000) is a smashing success. The star of the event is 
Judy Kaye, whose fearless characterizations and the ability to vary vocal 
delivery from laceratingly acidulous to comfortingly mellifluous make her 
perhaps the one soprano in captivity equally at home in musical comedy and on 
the recital stage. Her skilled, dedicated colleagues in the enterprise are 
baritone William Sharp and the piano duo of Michael Barrett and Steven Blier. 
</P>
<P>
Koch's coupling is a collection of the wry best of the Bernstein of "On the 
Town," "Wonderful Town" and "Songfest," with the same performers. Not a dud in 
the lot, and there's a revelation: the wrenchingly lovely "Dream with Me," 
dropped from Bernstein's 1949 "Peter Pan" score and never before recorded. Kaye 
sings it with the textual sensitivity and vocal control of a lieder singer, the 
naturalness of a mistress of pop. 
</P>
<P>
Not content with the limited exposure likely for the chamber original, 
Bernstein commissioned from composer Bright Sheng an orchestration of "Aria and 
Barcarolles" which has been recorded by the Schwarz-Seattle team (Delos 3078). 
The expansion succeeds only in diminishing the score. 
</P>
<P>
The rueful, person-to-person quality of the original slips into theatrical 
posturing when Bernstein's intimacies are pitched against an ensemble of 
strings and percussion. Furthermore, Delos' female protagonist, Jane Bunnell, 
is too contained and neutral in expression to offer even token competition to 
Kaye. 
</P>
<P>
And, while Dale Duesing, with his gleaming, cultivated baritone, is potentially 
more communicative than Koch's Sharp, the orchestration is against him. 
</P>
<P>
Delos' program further includes Barber's "School for Scandal" Overture and a 
first recording of Gershwin's "An American in Paris" in an edition that 
restores, to minimal effect, some measures the composer deleted from the score 
after its premiere.

RECORD RACK: **** KIRSTY MACCOLL "KITE" CHARISMA: ALBUMS RATED ON A SCALE OF 
ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC). 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Nine years after her first solo album, the daughter of the late Irish folk 
giant Ewan MacColl, wife of big-time producer Steve Lillywhite (who did the 
honors here) and session vocalist extraordinaire returns with what can only be 
described as a contemporary folk-rock record, reminiscent of what the Kinks or 
the Smiths would sound like if they were fronted by a real woman. 
</P>
<P>
That's scarcely an idol comparison, either -- earwitness MacColl's offhandedly 
breathtaking versions of the former's "Days" and the latter's "You Just Haven't 
Earned It Yet, Baby." 
</P>
<P>
More important, these and a third (McGarrigles) non-original aren't even the 
best bits. 
</P>
<P>
Propelled by indelible, whispering, bell-like melodies and 
anything-but-textbook guitar textures from the likes of one-time Pretender 
Robbie McIntosh and ex-Smiths star Johnny Marr, MacColl's own tunes are marked 
by a gimlet-eyed sense of detail: "Innocence," "Fifteen Minutes," "Free World," 
"Don't Come the Cowboy With Me Sonny Jim!" and "What Do Pretty Girls Do?" -- 
there's not a cliched moment in the lot. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, MacColl chases these pints of shimmering sarcasm with double shots 
of tough love and compassion ("No Victims," "Mother's Ruin," "You and Me Baby," 
"End of a Perfect Day"). She sings all the harmonies, too. So what's a woman 
gotta do to get noticed, shave her head? DON WALLER

RECORD RACK: ** 1/2 ANITA BAKER "COMPOSITIONS" ELEKTRA: ALBUMS RATED ON A SCALE

On one level -- as a showcase for Baker's vocal expertise -- this is an 
admirable album. Those who appreciate canny vocal attacks can marvel at her 
jazzy styling -- complete with offbeat phrasing, anguished wails and novel note 
extensions. 
</P>
<P>
As a female jazz/R&amp;B singer, Baker has no peer. 
</P>
<P>
But on other levels, this album of sad love songs has problems. Though 
generally spare, the arrangements suffocate the songs, which seldom flow 
smoothly. "Fairy Tales," extended by a graceful piano solo, is the lone 
exception. The mostly slow, sometimes medium tempos seem to drag. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the album's scope is too narrow -- too much melancholy. Even a 
medium-tempo song like "Soul Inspiration" is more suitable for a blue mood. 
Despite its slight bounce, "Lonely" is tinged in gloom. 
</P>
<P>
If you're down in the dumps, listening to this album can be fun, like 
commiserating with someone in the same boat. Otherwise, unless you really love 
Baker's voice, the album will be a real bring-down. 
</P>
<P>
Baker needs to lighten up a bit. A cheery song or two, about nothing very 
serious, would have given this album some badly needed variety. 
</P>
<P>
She has accumulated a large pop following with her previous two albums -- which 
do have some pop appeal. But this album, with its much stronger jazz/R&amp;B 
slant, may alienate the pop crowd. DENNIS HUNT

RECORD RACK: HARRY CONNICK JR. *** "WE ARE IN LOVE"** 1/2: "LOFTY'S ROACH

ALBUMS RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).

<P>
After the fireworks surrounding Harry Connick Jr.'s initial burst onto the jazz 
scene in 1988 subsided, he might have had to slug it out with other pianists 
and singers, from Marcus Roberts to Michael Feinstein. Such bouts would have 
been tough, the outcomes uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
But along came Connick's appearance on the score of "When Harry Met Sally," 
and, well, you know the rest. Connick's third album, "When Harry Met Sally . . 
. Music from the Motion Picture," has sold more than 700,000 to date -- more 
than doubling the combined sales of his first two LPs. 
</P>
<P>
With that music Connick expanded his approach. He's still sticking with pop 
standards that marked his early work, but now he most often sings them with the 
backing of a 40-piece orchestra conducted by Marc Shaiman. 
</P>
<P>
If it works, don't fix it, so Connick takes this successful tack a step further 
with "We Are in Love," one of the two albums he's simultaneously released. Here 
almost all the tunes -- 10 written by Connick and associates plus two standards 
-- are rendered in orchestral settings laid out very nicely by Shaiman. While 
not Nelson Riddle, he's no slouch. 
</P>
<P>
Against these lush backdrops, where muted trombones cushion a vocal and strings 
and brass vie with the leader for attention, Connick wields his dusky, 
part-Sinatra, part-Torme tenor, adding a touch of nasality that makes him sound 
as if he's from Brooklyn rather than New Orleans. The kid may not have Ol' 
Blues Eyes' magic pipes, but he can handle a tune, and with pretty good 
feeling, too. 
</P>
<P>
The leader's originals, from the dapper title track to the somber "Buried in 
Blue," written for his mother at the time of her death, recall other standards, 
but they have a unique quality that keeps them apart from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Now and then Connick drops some of his piano into the proceedings and goes from 
being Sinatra to being Thelonious Monk. Two tracks feature effective saxophone 
passages from Branford Marsalis, one of Connick's homies. 
</P>
<P>
The other album, "Lofty's Roach Souffle" is strictly trio stuff, and it suffers 
from sameness. Connick's style -- 60% Monk, 20% Ellington and 20% Harry -- is 
technically limited and only modestly expressive: It lacks the ribald 
excitement and unexpectedness of either Monk or Ellington. The tunes have some 
flavor, and Connick can capture a mood and hold it -- that's a plus. 
</P>
<P>
The video is a pleasing enough mishmash of music videos -- "It Had to Be You" 
is fun, as is "Do You Know What it Means (to Miss New Orleans)," where Dr. John 
guests -- along with performance footage from London and interview material. 
</P>
<P>
One wonders, though, who will buy these wares. Connick, 22, is evoking a style 
that was popular in the '40s and '50s, yet many of the fans at his concerts are 
said to be young. Was the grand success of the music from "When Harry Met 
Sally" due to the popularity of the film, or is Connick a real live star on his 
own? 
</P>
<P>
The answer should be clear by the end of the year, when sales figures for these 
albums will be in and the public has had a chance to assess Connick's cinematic 
talents -- he makes his acting debut in "Memphis Belle," due for release in 
October. The way things look from here, Connick's star has only just begun to 
rise. ZAN STEWART

POP EYE: IS RUMPOLE ON MICHAEL JACKSON'S LIST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Jackson's sudden break with his long-time attorney and adviser John 
Branca has all the intrigue and suspense of a genuine pop "Thriller." 
</P>
<P>
The question everybody's asking: Why has pop's biggest star severed ties with 
Branca, the top rock attorney who guided Jackson's career for more than a 
decade? 
</P>
<P>
Industry insiders offered a variety of conflicting plot twists after the news 
broke last week, but there was one common thread: The name of David Geffen, an 
industry power broker and longtime Jackson inner-circle adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation over Geffen's alleged role in the drama ranged from a power 
struggle between the chairman of Geffen Records and Branca to a long-range plan 
to possibly lure Jackson away from CBS Records. 
</P>
<P>
Branca and the always press-shy Jackson refused to comment -- and Geffen 
insisted he was not responsible for Branca's departure. "I had absolutely 
nothing to do with it," said Geffen, who recently sold his company to MCA in 
exchange for about $540 million worth of MCA stock. 
</P>
<P>
Geffen continued: "I just think Michael decided it was time to make a change. 
It's no reflection on John. I think he's a superb attorney." 
</P>
<P>
However, Geffen acknowledged that Branca's law partner, Kenneth Ziffren, has 
severed his ties with Geffen and his company in the wake of Branca's departure. 
</P>
<P>
"Kenny is an old friend, who remains a good friend," said Geffen, who is also 
one of four members of a committee that regularly advises Jackson on financial 
investments. "But I think Kenny feels I should have warned him about what was 
going on. I just didn't feel I had the right to share whatever I might know 
about Michael's business with him -- or anybody." 
</P>
<P>
The break comes at a critical juncture in Jackson's career and a short time 
after being released from St. John's (CHK) Hospital where he spent several days

* Numerous key industry figures, none of whom wanted to be identified, 
confirmed that Jackson, who has been without a formal manager for more than a 
year, has been negotiating a contract with the L.A.-based management firm 
Steifel-Phillips, which has had success in recent years handling the careers of 
Rod Stewart, Suzanna Hoffs and Prince. The split with Branca has apparently put 
this deal on hold. 
</P>
<P>
* Jackson is also scheduled to deliver his much-delayed new album to CBS 
Records by Aug. 1. The package, which has been shrouded in secrecy, was 
initially billed as a greatest-hits collection with perhaps four new songs. But 
the album may now consist of all-new material. 
</P>
<P>
* More importantly, Jackson has been in the process of renegotiating his 
multimillion-dollar contract with CBS -- and has made it clear that CBS will 
not receive the album until his deal is done. 
</P>
<P>
While some observers blamed the ousting of Branca on Jackson's unpredictable 
temperament, several suggested the departure was prompted by tensions 
surrounding the CBS negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
The veteran attorney handles a host of big names (including the Rolling Stones, 
Poison, David Lee Roth and several key corporate clients) and has been credited 
with helping establish Jackson as one of pop's wealthiest stars, thanks in 
large part to his extensive music publishing holdings, which include a Beatles 
catalogue now valued at more than $125 million. 
</P>
<P>
One of Branca's strengths -- his good working relationship with CBS Records -- 
could have led to his downfall, some speculate. 
</P>
<P>
"Rightly or wrongly, Michael was apparently unhappy -- or at least concerned -- 
with the way Branca was handling the renegotiation," said one top level exec. 
"He seemed to feel he needed someone who wasn't so closely associated with CBS 
as Branca." 
</P>
<P>
Suggested another insider, "It's possible Branca brought some of this on by 
building a lot of his practice on Michael's shoulders. But like many pop stars, 
Michael is very insecure and was apparently jealous of any time Branca spent 
with other clients. . . . Michael could be worried about whether he'll ever be 
able to repeat the huge success he had in the mid-'80s. Maybe he has 
expectations that no one can possibly fulfill." 
</P>
<P>
Several insiders speculated that if negotiations with CBS were to go badly, 
Jackson might choose to leave CBS -- and sign with Geffen or another label -- 
using a complicated legal loophole involving a seven-year limitation on binding 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Geffen insists he has no intention of signing Jackson -- and sources close to 
Jackson say the pop star has no interest in leaving CBS -- unless negotiations 
reach an impasse. 
</P>
<P>
As it stands, Jackson is scheduled to interview possible new legal advisers. It 
is expected that instead of hiring one attorney, he will spread his affairs 
among several lawyers, with one for music publishing, one for his CBS 
negotiations and one or more for films and litigation. Among the leading 
contenders are Lee Phillips (for publishing), Bert Fields (for litigation) and 
Alan Grubman (for record-label matters).

Having contributed withering GIT-tar fire to the likes of Zappa, Roth, 
White-snake and the "Crossroads" movie, maestro Steve Vai cuts loose with a 
solo album of instrumentals (vaguely) linked by kozmik spoken-word bullstuff. 
</P>
<P>
The playing, of course, is dazzling. Vai has an impressive musical vocabulary 
-- and a tendency to slice 'n' dice every hip triptych known to man or 
machine-head into every square moment. The result is an intense, if somewhat 
wearying, experience. Don Waller

After 13 years, as many albums and somewhere in the 'hood of 9 million sold, 
Cameo has earned its status as the true keeper of the funk flame the 
old-fashioned way -- they burned it down, clown, on 1982's "Alligator Woman," 
1984's "Talkin' Out the Side of Your Neck" and, especially, 1986's "Word Up!," 
which brought the group its first real taste of cross-the-tracks cce$$. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing as how their last album was a pale imitation of its predecessor, this 
time out Larry Blackmon and company are back in black, Jack, rappin' 'n' 
raffishly riffin' in full-effect mode. 
</P>
<P>
Which -- for those readers who do not speak jive -- translates as techno-funk a 
la Thumparumpasaurus wrecks. 
</P>
<P>
Using a krazee-quilt combination of synthetic/organic keyboards 'n' hipshot! 
percussion, greazy basslines and goofbawl vocals, (heavy on the minor 
sevenths), Cameo rolls back the rug for a wall-to-off-the-wall dance party, 
with the house-of-whacks "I Want It Now" and the over-the-counter Afro-desiac 
"Nan-Yea" providing the most innovative moments. The two ballads, delivered in 
a strained Delfonics style, tie for least-interesting honors. Don Waller

For those who don't mind a heavy dose of predictability in their music, "Livin' 
It Up" provides a fairly pleasant outing -- but not much more. Strait shows no 
sign of breaking with the past as he enters his second decade of making nice, 
neat records that don't fuss with the extremes of human emotion. He may claim 
to be livin' it up, but George never veers far from the Strait and narrow.

This Parisian octet's debut album includes songs in English, French, Spanish 
and Arabic, and sports a rough-edged, sprawling approach reminiscent of the 
Clash's "Sandinista" album. There's a gospel/metal rap about a dead Rasta, a Bo 
Diddley-knows-rockabilly exercise, pure salsa, loopy carnival music. . . . The 
genre-hopping means "Puta's Fever" suffers from an occasional loss of focus, 
but when drummer Santiago Casariego kicks into overdrive, a rowdy verve 
pervades the music. DON SNOWDEN

THEATRESPORTS PLAYS THE COMEDY GAME; 
</P>
<P>
THESE CHEERING, BOOING, ROWDY FANS AREN'T JUST ANY BLEACHER BUMS. THEY ARE WILD

These are serious sports fans, hungry for action. Outside the arena, they 
jockey for position, eager for the games to begin. Some wear shirts and caps 
identifying team loyalties. Once inside, they mock the organist, cheer the coin 
toss, boo refs, root for favorite players, wear grocery bags over their heads, 
stand to bellow a "national anthem" -- except tonight's anthem is a commercial 
ditty for Oscar Mayer hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
That's because this isn't the Lakers or Raiders or Dodgers or Kings. These fans 
aren't just any bleacher bums. This game is called "Theatresports," and these 
rowdy followers are theater patrons. 
</P>
<P>
Each Monday night for the past year and a half, a hybrid of competitive sports 
and improvisational comedy has packed Theatre/Theater in Hollywood. Theatre 
sports combines the best of both worlds: ensemble acting and team competition, 
spontaneous sketches and strictly enforced rules. It also prompts usually staid 
theater audiences into action. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, during a recent performance, a volunteer from the audience was 
asked to describe her day. She did -- including several embarrassing details 
that quickly expanded in the resulting sketch. "I woke up," she confessed, "and 
I wasn't alone." Oops. The inventive improv actors pounced. In the sketch, her 
day began in a bed with five men. 
</P>
<P>
Later, another member of the audience suggested proctology as a sketch subject. 
Oops. "Bag her!" shouted the rabid fans of Theatresports. A shopping bag 
covered her head for 60 seconds. The referee had warned both players and fans 
to avoid "sexist, racist, or gratuitous poo-poo caca humor." This is a game for 
team players, not for super-crassers like Andrew Dice Clay or Eddie Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
Theatresports is the brainchild of Canadian acting instructor Keith Johnstone, 
author of "Improv." In 1975, while teaching theater at the University of 
Calgary in Alberta, Johnstone wondered why sports events could fill huge 
stadiums. He looked at wrestling matches, which are basically choreographed 
theater, and saw audiences cheering and shouting. How could you get that kind 
of energy into a theater? 
</P>
<P>
Johnstone's research led him to suspect that "the thrill of victory and the 
agony of defeat" is more than mere rhetorical hype. The spirit of competition, 
he discovered, compels passionate loyalty and involvement. Audiences like 
danger, he decided, so a savvy ploy might be to put actors at risk. 
</P>
<P>
Johnstone borrowed specifics from Olympic sporting events. At each performance, 
members of an ensemble draw numbers that divide them into three teams of 
players. Three judges are brought in from other improv groups or professions -- 
sometimes they're television stars or film directors -- to rate sketches on a 
score of 0 to 5. A "Vanna White" marks a scoreboard. A referee penalizes teams 
when specific improv rules are violated, such as "blocking" (refusing to follow 
an actor's lead). Dead-end scenes are "horned" (ended) by judges. And when 
cheap laughs are pursued through toilet humor, out comes the humiliating bag. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, audiences are encouraged to cheer their favorites, offer sketch 
ideas and just act like wild and crazy sports fans. 
</P>
<P>
Johnstone's shrewd scholarship proved remarkably popular. Theatresports now has 
improv teams competing across Canada and in the United States, Europe and 
Australia. Periodically, teams meet for a world series. Last month, the local 
team, Los Angeles Theatresports (LATS), competed in the American Improv 
Festival in New York. It won first place during the U.S. Theatresports 
Tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
This understandably pleases LATS artistic directors Ellen Idelson and Dan 
O'Connor. Former members of BATS (Bay Area Theatresports), they ventured south 
less than two years ago. Both knew that Los Angeles was overcrowded with comics 
and improv groups, from the Groundlings to the Comedy Store to Second City. The 
competition for audience attention causes a notoriously high failure rate. 
Nevertheless, along with ex-teammate Forrest Brakeman (founder and director of 
L.A.'s Comedy Omelette), they opened a local franchise. 
</P>
<P>
It was no overnight success. Promoting yet another night of improv proved a 
tough sell. But they outlasted the defunct L.A. Aztecs soccer team. Now LATS is 
more popular than, say, the L.A. Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is obvious: They try harder. After a recent night of competition, 
O'Connor, 27, gave a pep talk to his players that could have been scripted by 
former Lakers Coach Pat Riley. 
</P>
<P>
"This evening there was a great deal of gagging going on," O'Connor told them. 
"Everybody here is too good to play safe. I challenge you to not only make them 
laugh but to tell a story. Try to get it to that other level where it becomes 
narrative. Make positive choices. Push yourselves all the way out." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, before joining their players for a post-game celebration, O'Connor 
and Idelson talked about Theatresports. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a different setup from most improv groups," Idelson, 29, said. "You don't 
need to audition to get in. Our dues are very inexpensive. We offer a place 
where people can play. It's an oasis. The basic principles involve embracing 
failure. Once you learn to have a good time and fail good-naturedly, not much 
else is really that frightening." 
</P>
<P>
Those wishing to become members can sign up for the starting workshop, which 
costs $75 and is held once a month. According to Idelson, "You get everything 
you need to know about Theatresports in 12 hours." Graduates who want to play 
pay monthly dues of $40, which entitles them to classes at least once a week 
plus the chance to perform before a paying audience. The number is (213) 
469-9689. 
</P>
<P>
In Johnstone's words, Theatresports is for "brave people who are able to bear 
the pain of failure." 
</P>
<P>
But how does this make Theatresports different from Second City? 
</P>
<P>
"I think they put a lot of pressure on themselves to really be funny," Idelson 
answered, speaking of Second City-styled improv groups. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't have the luxury that we do," added O'Connor, "which is to fail. We 
can go out and just really suck wind -- be really bad. Audiences aren't sitting 
there saying, 'Entertain me.' We have the benefit of the audiences venting 
their anger on the judges. Even if you bomb, you're still supported and 
appreciated." 
</P>
<P>
"Also, we're a bit unique because we don't invite a lot of agents and casting 
directors," Idelson said. "This is not a means to an end. This is an end in 
itself. We don't want people to shine and be taken away and given a series. 
That's not what it's about. This is where you stay sharp. This is very much an 
ensemble effort." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor agreed. "Since this is L.A., a lot of people call in and want to 
showcase themselves. We don't want to be a place where people pay to play. 
Taking the class is no guarantee you'll go public." 
</P>
<P>
Theatresports has a group of six coaches who teach the classes. There are three 
levels of players: rookies, junior varsity and varsity. These rankings have 
nothing to do with experience -- many so-called students have worked with other 
improv groups -- -- but with knowing how Theatresports is played. 
</P>
<P>
The criteria? "Are you fun to play with?" O'Connor said. "Do you share the 
stage with others?" 
</P>
<P>
Some Theatresports terms are similar to those found in other improv teachings, 
such as blocking and hesitation (delaying a game.) But wimping and waffling 
come from sports, as does the dreaded bag. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, the bag is a way of making sure we don't resort to cheap toilet 
humor," Idelson said. "Most of our people have done 'bar prov' before. There 
you need a punch line every five seconds." In Theatresports lingo, this is 
known as "pouring for laughs." 
</P>
<P>
Both have studied in Canada under Johnstone, whom O'Connor calls "the godfather 
of improv." 
</P>
<P>
"Johnstone keeps pulsing new information into the groups," O'Connor said. 
</P>
<P>
When the numerous Theatresports groups meet in tournaments, the teams trade 
information. LATS plans eventually to add a New York game, "the Stanislavsky 
Open," named after the Russian actor, director and teacher, during which rival 
improv groups with different techniques can compete. At the last tournament, a 
National Alliance of Theatresports was formed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about real good will and good nature toward each other," said Idelson. 
"And we incorporate that with our business dealings as well. Support and 
generosity. We're like a real good family." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor seconded her opinion. "We're real happy and real proud that we made it 
this far in Los Angeles. It's very hard to be involved with any group of actors 
and kind of function coherently without infighting and craziness and chaos. But 
we take the precepts of Theatresports seriously: If you don't agree with 
something, you have to counter with a solution." 
</P>
<P>
That's what's known as good sportsmanship -- even when the solution is to wear 
a shopping bag.

MUSIC NOTEBOOK: ENTERTAINERS ARE HONORING ONE OF THEIR OWN FOR LOVE OF COUNTRY

<P>
A little more than 2 1/2 years ago, one of Southern California's most important 
musical showcases was formed. Ronnie Mack, a singer who'd been active on the 
local rockabilly circuit, began the Barn Dance, a live radio show presenting 
mostly new country music acts and patterned on such '50s country music 
television showcases as "Town Hall Party" and "Cal's Corral." 
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, numerous local musicians will pay tribute to Mack, who also 
plays Wednesday nights at the Tam O'Shanter in Los Feliz, in a special matinee 
program at the Palomino. That club has been the Barn Dance's home since August, 
1987, when Mack moved the Tuesday night program there from the smaller Little 
Nashville club. The radio broadcasts ceased when the Barn Dance's outlet, Cal 
State Northridge-affiliated KCSN-FM, dropped its country music format. But the 
show goes on. 
</P>
<P>
"Ronnie's always been very generous," said guitarist John Jorgenson of the 
hit-making Desert Rose Band. "He's always given me the opportunity to try out 
new musicians or new material. I also like the Barn Dance as an opportunity to 
interact with other guitarists in front of an audience. There aren't a lot of 
places you can do that." 
</P>
<P>
Dale Watson, a young country singer who came to Los Angeles from Texas last 
year, compares Mack to the '50s disc jockey who first brought rock 'n' roll to 
a mass audience: "I think of Ronnie as the Alan Freed of country music, 
showcasing bands who don't have a reputation yet." 
</P>
<P>
Several acts that have been (and who, in many cases, continue to be) Barn Dance 
regulars have won recording contracts: Jann Browne, Rosie Flores and Jim 
Lauderdale with Warner Bros., Chris Gaffney with ROM, and Watson with Curb. 
</P>
<P>
Jorgenson and Watson both point out, accurately, that Mack loses money on the 
Barn Dance shows. "It'd be a lot easier on him if he'd drop the whole thing," 
Watson said. "But he does it because he loves it." 
</P>
<P>
Jorgenson agreed. "The thing about Ronnie is, he really loves the music." 
</P>
<P>
Jorgenson won't be at this afternoon's show; the Desert Rose Band is scheduled 
to be in Michigan. But he did play last Tuesday's Barn Dance, as a member of 
the "Hellecasters" with guitarists Will Ray and Jerry Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
Browne isn't expected either. But the list of celebrities who have promised to 
show for this afternoon's festivities includes Watson, Gaffney, Flores and 
Lauderdale, Will Ray, James Intveld, King Cotton, the Mustangs, George 
Highfill, Lucinda Williams, Dave Alvin, the Trailer Park Casanovas, Eddie 
Baytos, Mandy Mercier and the Crawfish Wranglers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tribute to Ronnie Mack will take place from noon until 8 p.m. today at the 
Palomino, 6907 Lankershim Blvd., North Hollywood. Admission is $5. For further 
information, call (818) 764-4010. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Shari Famous Show," a showcase for singers, musicians, comics and heaven 
knows what else, has relocated from Tuesday nights at Cafe Largo in West 
Hollywood to Sundays at The Pink in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Singer/comic/actress Famous has presented acts including Exene Cervenka, Sandra 
Tsing Loh, Chuck E. Weiss, Robin Ryan and Philip Litell. Several acts perform 
relatively brief sets each night, and the one constant -- other than Famous 
herself -- is the guarantee of plenty of variety. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Shari Famous Show" is held Sunday nights beginning at 7:30 at The Pink, 
2810 Main St., Santa Monica. Admission is $5, with inexpensive food and drink 
available. For information, call (213) 392-1077.

FOR A REAL GOOD KEBAB, EXPANDED, PEACEFUL CAFE MEDITERRANEAN FILLS THE BILL

<P>
I learned to enjoy Middle Eastern food back in my college days at a peculiarly 
misnamed establishment called Kwikee Take Out. Owned by a crazed and 
big-hearted man named Tommy, Kwikee Take Out looked like any college town beer 
and pizza hall except that the menu had more than a hundred items, most of them 
Middle Eastern specialties such as Greek salads, dolmas, falafel and 
spanakopita. 
</P>
<P>
For at least a year, until I made my way through that menu, Kwikee Take Out was 
the only place I wanted to eat. The food was lusty, the portions large, the 
prices low. It was culinary adventuring on a student budget and I loved every 
minute there. Kwikee Take Out was my introductory course to Middle Eastern 
fare, my International Eating 101. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the wobbly furniture, hard-drinking student clientele and deafening 
noise level would hold little allure; indeed, Kwikee Take Out hasn't been my 
favorite restaurant for nearly 20 years. I still get a hankering for a really 
good kebab, though. I have found just such a kebab recently -- tender, 
succulent, medium-rare lamb -- in a very peaceful and palatable atmosphere at 
the Cafe Mediterranean in Toluca Lake. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Cafe Mediterranean was a small corner storefront, but 11 months ago 
it doubled in size to accommodate its burgeoning business. Now composed of two 
pretty dining rooms, the place is thriving; in the pink, one might say. 
</P>
<P>
At the very least one must say that it is pink -- very pink. The walls are 
pink, the table linens are pink, the to-go menus are pink; it's like being 
inside a pink tutti-frutti jelly bean. This is not an unpleasant sensation. 
There are other non-unpleasant sensations as well: sunshine from a skylight, 
fresh flowers on the tables, posters of Lebanon on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
I went there one day at noon with my friend Michele and we found ourselves 
lunching with the studio set -- men with gelled hair and women in leopard skin. 
Business was brisk. People looked rosy and healthy . . . in the pink. Good, 
creamy hummus was disappearing by the pound. 
</P>
<P>
Michele, who lived in Iran for a number of years, pronounced the baba ghanouj 
some of the best eggplant dip she's ever eaten and highly approved of the 
strong dose of cumin in the lentil soup. Neither she nor I, however, approved 
of the beef barley soup, which was chock-full of canned mushrooms. "Everything 
else here is so fresh and good," Michele said with the kind of outrage only a 
fan could have. "I really don't think they should use canned mushrooms, do 
you?" No, I admitted, I didn't. 
</P>
<P>
The shish kebab, which was supposed to include bell peppers, tomatoes and 
onions, came with only a few slips of onion on the skewer. To tell the truth, I 
didn't much care, because the meat was excellent. We also liked the fried 
kibbeh, which is a kind of crunchy-coated, spicy lamb meatball. 
</P>
<P>
Portions were generous -- too generous, really, though if I'd paid better 
attention to the menu I could have ordered more wisely. Many items come in two 
sizes and prices, but if you don't specify the smaller size, the waiters 
automatically bring you the larger. This seemed the slightest bit sneaky to me, 
but otherwise the service was good: prompt, attentive and very friendly. 
</P>
<P>
Michele referred to our particularly friendly, helpful, amused waiter as "a 
comic Levantine." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you mean comic valentine?" I asked, thinking of the candy-pink color 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
"No, a Levantine," she said. "Someone from the Levant, the eastern 
Mediterranean. It comes from the French word for sunrise." 
</P>
<P>
The next time he appeared at our table, I asked our waiter if he was from the 
Levant. He paused a moment, then said, "Yes, Levant is the Phoenician word for 
what we now call Lebanon." A comic Levantine. 
</P>
<P>
Over the course of several more visits, I enjoyed nearly everything I tried 
except the Mediterranean shrimp, which were dry, hard and tasteless. The yogurt 
is very fresh and homemade. Everything but the pita bread -- everything from 
the dolmas (stuffed grape leaves) to the baklava -- is made on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, all the items wrapped in filo were delicious, starting with the 
cheese and spinach boreks (spelled bourac on this menu). The Moroccan bestila 
(which the menu calls bastia and is filled with a cashew, chicken and egg 
mixture) is evocative, provocative and slightly sweet. Best of all is the 
kouzi, an inspired version of a meat potpie flavored with allspice. 
</P>
<P>
At dinner, perhaps because the customers have had a chance to go home and 
change their clothes, the Cafe Mediterranean has the look and feel of a 
favorite neighborhood haunt, very casual and cozy. There are young couples and 
older couples and tables full of friends on their way to or from the movies. 
</P>
<P>
Something about the place -- was it the easy atmosphere, the slightly 
uncomfortable wooden chairs, the hearty, full-flavored food? -- reminded me of 
the happy times I spent at Kwikee Take Out and the relief I feel at not being 
of that age and on that budget anymore. The Cafe Mediterranean is quieter, 
saner and pricier: In other words, it's the perfect place for all us graduates 
of International Eating 101.

'MR. TORNADO' DEVOTES LIFE TO UNDERSTANDING NATURE'S AWESOME DESTRUCTIVE POWER 
</P>

<P>
Tetsuya Theodore Fujita saw his only natural tornado near Denver in 1982. "It 
was like meeting my lover," he says. 
</P>
<P>
"Since then, my passion really went up," said Fujita, a professor of 
geophysical science who has been studying tornadoes for 42 years and is 
considered one of the world's foremost authorities on the violent storms. 
</P>
<P>
Fujita, 69, spends much of his time in his lab at the University of Chicago 
creating tornadoes for research. 
</P>
<P>
He creates tornadoes over a large fan, which makes a swirling motion; another 
fan above simulates a low-pressure system by adding an updraft to the mix. With 
a bit of steam added to make the phenomenon visible, he creates twisters six to 
eight feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
The miniature versions are as impossible to redirect or squelch as their 
full-size cousins, he says. He has tried by crawling right up next to them and 
using rulers or books to change their direction. 
</P>
<P>
Fujita came to the United States from Japan in 1953, partly because there are 
so many tornadoes in this country. 
</P>
<P>
"Tornadoes are very rare in Japan," Fujita said. "They have about 10 to 15 a 
year. But one occurred within about 15 miles of my hometown. I was quite 
impressed with the localized severity of the wind." 
</P>
<P>
When he saw his first tornado, he and a team of scientists were studying wind 
shear and its effect on aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a beautiful thing," Fujita said. "Of course, I was 20 miles away from 
that one. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're in it," he added, "it's a terrible thing." 
</P>
<P>
Forecasters still have trouble predicting tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
But Fujita has helped define the conditions most likely to spawn them. Groups 
of thunderstorms are not as likely to spawn tornadoes as single, large storms 
because multiple storms in the same area compete. 
</P>
<P>
"Each one tries to rotate, but they all can't. They're just like human beings: 
The rich may become richer and the poor may get poorer." 
</P>
<P>
Fujita also discovered that most strong tornadoes are actually six or seven 
small twisters he calls suction vortices, rotating around the center of a 
larger tornado. 
</P>
<P>
"A suction vortex can pick up a car or a small house or something, but when 
you're standing right next to it you can be completely safe." 
</P>
<P>
He has studied tornadoes that have dropped houses into lakes, made off with one 
car and left another right next to it untouched, and moved whole flocks of cows 
and sheep -- which lived through the experience. 
</P>
<P>
He also developed the Fujita scale for measuring the strength of tornadoes. It 
runs from zero -- a tornado that might break twigs on trees -- to five -- a 
twister that can rip houses from their foundations. 
</P>
<P>
But Fujita considers his work on other air movements called downbursts and 
microbursts among his most significant achievements. 
</P>
<P>
Downbursts are powerful drafts of air moving down from a thunderstorm cloud. 
Scientists long thought the drafts dissipated before reaching the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Microbursts are smaller versions of downbursts, but are more dangerous because 
they give pilots less time to react, Fujita said. 
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board has cited microbursts, a term coined 
by Fujita, as the cause of 17 aircraft accidents in the last 15 years, causing 
577 fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
Among them was the 1985 crash of a Delta L-1011 in Dallas that killed 137 
people. A downburst also was implicated in the collapse of a wall at a school 
in Newburgh, N.Y., that killed nine children. 
</P>
<P>
Fujita's work helped persuade the Federal Aviation Administation to begin 
installing a new radar system at 47 major airports beginning in the early 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
The Doppler radar system was credited with helping three jetliners at Denver's 
airport avoid potentially catastrophic microbursts last year. 
</P>
<P>
Fujita retires from teaching this year, but will continue his research at the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
"In Texas one time, five people were killed when they drove right into a 
tornado. They just didn't know any better," Fujita said. "I want to make people 
safer."

EVEN AS IRON CURTAIN CRUMBLES, AN IRISH CURTAIN CONTINUES TO TAKE SHAPE IN 
BELFAST 
</P>

BELFAST, Northern Ireland

<TEXT>
<P>
They can be found in a variety of styles and pleasant colors, often on 
landscaped lawns along with flower beds. They could belong to parks or elegant 
private estates. 
</P>
<P>
These walls, however, have been erected for a far more serious purpose. They 
are meant to stop people from killing each other. 
</P>
<P>
They are the "peace lines" of Northern Ireland's capital, the barriers that for 
two decades of guerrilla conflict have divided Protestant and Roman Catholic 
ghettoes. 
</P>
<P>
For most of that time they were high fences of corrugated iron. They were 
crudely patched up when they rusted or got torn down in the violence between 
Catholic nationalists seeking unity with Ireland and Protestants who want 
Ulster to remain part of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The British government gradually has been replacing the shabby eyesores with 
red brick walls, tall railings and steel panels covered with gleaming new 
paint. 
</P>
<P>
The network has been built up at strategic points across the city and continues 
to grow. Police said recently that yet another barrier is to be added soon. 
</P>
<P>
The obvious comparisons to the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain have not 
escaped the people of the divided city. 
</P>
<P>
"While other people pull their walls down, we're rebuilding ours -- nicely 
decorated," one resident said. 
</P>
<P>
"Barriers are coming down all over Europe," said moderate nationalist leader 
John Hume, who rejects the violent route to Irish unity chosen by guerrillas of 
the Irish Republican Army. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we to be the last?" 
</P>
<P>
The British government denies that the new brick peace lines signal permanence 
-- or pessimism over finding a solution to the conflict that has claimed almost 
3,000 lives in the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"They're something that was here anyway. Since they're a reality, we only want 
to make them more attractive," said one official. 
</P>
<P>
"They're what the people in those areas want on both sides. It seems to give 
communities a sense of reassurance." 
</P>
<P>
The government is also pouring money into building neat brick homes to replace 
bleak rows of substandard houses that fueled the Catholic minority's charges of 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Even the notorious Divis Flats are coming down. This massive concrete apartment 
complex close to the city center was put up hurriedly to house Catholics who 
fled their homes in the early days of the violence. 
</P>
<P>
The tall buildings and their balconies made the housing complex an instant 
fortress for nationalist gunmen and the scene of some of Belfast's fiercest 
fighting -- as evidenced by bullet holes, scorched walls and shattered windows. 
</P>
<P>
The battles continue in Belfast, however. Streets have potholes from the latest 
bomb blast or are blackened where a car has burned. 
</P>
<P>
The barriers between Protestant and Catholic districts -- the British army 
calls them "interfaces" -- can be picked out by the gutted buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Many Catholic areas, however, now have an air of self-confidence that contrasts 
with the grim depression of a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Local people ascribe this partly to Britain's efforts to brighten their 
physical surroundings by building new homes, refurbishing houses that are worth 
saving, putting up sports centers and planting trees and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
They say it also stems from the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement that gave Dublin a 
consultative voice in day-to-day affairs in the province. Catholics see the 
joint civil service secretariat established under the agreement as providing 
them with a chance to air grievances about the way Northern Ireland is run. 
</P>
<P>
The Irish tricolor flag flies openly over buildings in Catholic districts in a 
way that would once have invited rapid Protestant retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
And nobody takes down unofficial signs renaming streets in Irish instead of 
English. Ballymurphy Parade is now Paraid Bhaile U Murchu. 
</P>
<P>
But at least one name change -- this time from English to English -- reflects 
the reality underneath. The plate at the beginning of Beechmount Avenue has 
been replaced with a sign saying "RPG Avenue." An RPG is a rocket-propelled 
grenade.

SCIENTISTS LOOKING AT SLEEP DISORDERS HAVE MADE SOME EYE-OPENING DISCOVERIES

<P>
Although sleep patterns may change over the years, scientists know that 
restless sleep is not an inevitable part of aging. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, troubled sleep may be a sign of emotional or physical disorders and 
should be evaluated by a doctor or sleep specialist. 
</P>
<P>
At any age there are some common sleep disorders. Tossing and turning all night 
is one example of insomnia, but there are others. Taking more than 30 to 45 
minutes to fall asleep, waking up many times each night, or waking up early and 
being unable to get back to sleep can mean you have insomnia. 
</P>
<P>
With rare exceptions, insomnia is the symptom of a problem, not the problem 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Snoring may signal another sleep disorder -- apnea. In this situation, the 
individual stops breathing for brief periods each night. Loud snoring coupled 
with daytime sleepiness may be symptoms of sleep apnea. A doctor specializing 
in sleep disorders can make a definite diagnosis and recommend treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Unusual leg movements, called nocturnal myoclonus or periodic movements of 
sleep, also are common. Although scientists don't know what causes these leg 
movements, sometimes medication can bring relief. Mild cases may be helped by 
leg exercises. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists researching sleep disorders have made some interesting discoveries. 
For example, Dr. Charles Czeisler and colleagues at Brigham and Women's 
Hospital in Boston and Harvard University, in a project funded by the National 
Institute on Aging, report that the body's internal biological clock is far 
more sensitive to light than previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Czeisler found that light may be the single most important factor in 
resetting this clock. Using this information, Czeisler and his colleagues have 
begun to treat some of the common sleep-related complaints of older patients. 
</P>
<P>
Other scientists are investigating the changes occurring in sleep and 
wakefulness as people age. Research also is exploring various treatments for 
sleep disorders and examining what the medical profession and the public need 
to know about good sleep practices. 
</P>
<P>
However, there are some things we already know: 
</P>
<P>
* Follow a regular schedule. Go to sleep and get up at the same time each day. 
</P>
<P>
* Try to exercise at regular times each day. Moderate physical activity two to 
four hours before bedtime may improve sleep. Check with a doctor before 
beginning any exercise program. 
</P>
<P>
* To adjust the internal sleep clock, try to get some exposure to the natural 
light in the afternoon each day. 
</P>
<P>
* Develop a bedtime routine. Do the same things each night to tell your body 
it's time to wind down. Some people watch the evening news, read a book, or 
soak in a warm bath. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes to help you sleep. Drinking even 
small amounts of alcohol can make it harder to stay asleep. Smoking is not only 
dangerous (the hazards of falling asleep with a lit cigarette), but nicotine is 
a stimulant. 
</P>
<P>
* Be aware of what you eat. Avoid caffeinated beverages late in the day. 
Caffeine is a stimulant. If you like a snack before bed, a glass of warm milk 
may help you relax. 
</P>
<P>
* After turning off the light, give yourself about 15 minutes to fall asleep. 
If you still are awake, or lose your drowsiness, get up and go into another 
room until you feel sleepy again. 
</P>
<P>
* Try not to worry about sleep. Playing mental games may help. For example, 
think black -- a black cat on a black pillow on a black sofa, etc. 
</P>
<P>
If you are so tired during the day that you cannot function, and this fatigue 
lasts more than two to three weeks, see a doctor.

FINNS CAMPAIGN TO RESTORE HEALTH-GIVING, WHOLESOME IMAGE OF TRADITIONAL SAUNA 
</P>

<P>
Finns are concerned that the sauna, the health-giving steambath they have been 
taking for generations, has become associated abroad with sex. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, we have no copyright on the word sauna, but it is a cause of 
annoyance to the Finn when he sees the word being misused in other countries," 
Pirkko Valtakari, executive secretary of the Finnish Sauna Society, said 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
The society and its sister organization, the International Sauna Society, are 
campaigning to stop foreigners from using the word sauna to describe what they 
say are often really massage parlors and houses of prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
The societies are asking Finnish embassies and missions abroad to help uphold 
the wholesome image of the sauna. 
</P>
<P>
According to a Finnish saying, one should behave in the sauna as if in church. 
</P>
<P>
Valtakari said that in Finland only members of the same family would take a 
mixed sauna. 
</P>
<P>
"Here we are very strict about segregating men and women in the sauna," the 
society's honorary president, Harald Teir, told a visitor to its sauna 
headquarters on Lauttasaari Island in Helsinki. 
</P>
<P>
Guardians of the true faith say the sauna should be heated by a wood fire, as 
is the society's sauna among the birch and pine woods on Lauttasaari. 
</P>
<P>
"My father was born in a sauna. Many of his generation were. The sauna was 
considered the most hygienic place in a house," said Teir, a retired physician 
and mentor to the society's 1,900 members. 
</P>
<P>
As he escorts visitors into the dark, slightly acrid-smelling sauna, Teir 
recalls the day in 1983 when George Bush, then-vice president, came as a guest. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize the need for security," Teir said, "but when he came here, I had to 
draw the line at armed guards coming into the sauna. 
</P>
<P>
"We still exchange letters. I have invited him to come back to celebrate my 
100th birthday in the sauna," said Teir, adding that this would be in the year 
2014. 
</P>
<P>
The smoky atmosphere and soot on the ceiling and upper benches at Lauttasaari 
contrast with the gleaming white pine appearance of most modern saunas. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the real Finnish sauna. I have heard the Swedes read newspapers in 
their saunas, but not here," said Teir, flicking water onto the hot stones with 
a birch swish to produce a stinging wave of steam. 
</P>
<P>
In the half-gloom, a visitor once accidentally spilled a whole tub of water 
over the stones. "It was like an atomic explosion," Teir said. "He was 
surprised when we Finns hit the floor as if we were under attack." 
</P>
<P>
In Finnish culture, traditional uses of the sauna included curing ham, 
threshing grain and drying linen. The sauna is also known to inhabitants of the 
Siberian tundra and North American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen and politicians often take their visitors to the sauna, believing 
that hostility vanishes in the steam and that rank and protocol are shed along 
with one's clothes. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Harri Holkeri's male cabinet members often take a joint sauna at 
their weekly meeting in his official residence, a government spokesman said.

Bathers emerge from the Lauttasaari smoke sauna streaked with soot from the 
benches, looking like blackened, barbecued lobsters. The hardier types walk 
along a heated path to the end of the private jetty and plunge into the Gulf of 
Finland. 
</P>
<P>
The society advises against drinking alcohol while taking a sauna, but not all 
Finns accept this stricture. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember when a man's affluence was measured by the amount of vodka he could 
buy for the Friday night sauna," said one businessman. 
</P>
<P>
The International Sauna Society groups Finland, Austria, Japan, West Germany, 
the Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland. It aims to publicize the sauna 
culture, encourage its use and promote scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
Next year the society holds its quadrennial congress in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese have their own ancient bathing culture," Valtakari said, "but we 
are teaching them how to take a real sauna."

MODERN NEEDS CLASH WITH ANCIENT WORLD OF DAMASCUS;

ARCHITECTURE: RUINS OF TEMPLES AND MOSQUES SHARE TEEMING OLD CITY NEIGHBORHOODS 
WITH GLITZY SHOPS, BOXY BUILDINGS.

DAMASCUS, Syria 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A boxy apartment-office building on concrete stilts surmounts ruins of the 
2,000-year-old Roman Temple of Jupiter, dramatizing the clash of old and new in 
this teeming, ancient city. 
</P>
<P>
A modern, marble-clad temple of commerce with jewelry shops and clothing 
boutiques is next door, opposite the ancient Islamic Medressah, or School of 
Nur ed-Din. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bad integration of the old and the new," said Nazih Kawakibi, a 
professor of architecture at Damascus University who serves on several 
restoration committees. "They could have done it much better." 
</P>
<P>
Like many cities in the Middle East, Damascus is bulging at the seams, trying 
to provide housing and services to a population estimated at 2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Damascus is considered one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities. 
The Arameans, nomads from the Arabian peninsula, settled here in 1200 B.C., 
eventually building a city that became an important commercial center. 
</P>
<P>
Greeks, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs and Ottomans have occupied Damascus. A 
treasure trove of monuments reflect the cultural tides that have swept over the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Some ancient sites, like the famed Ummayyad Mosque, were venerated by all the 
occupiers. 
</P>
<P>
The mosque site originally was a temple to Haddad, the Aramean god of thunder 
and lightning. 
</P>
<P>
It later became the Roman Temple of Jupiter. The Byzantines built a cathedral 
there, but the Arabs transformed it into the mosque, named for the Islamic 
dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
Only limited resources are available to preserve the ancient sites. 
</P>
<P>
Kawakibi pointed to the Medressah, just on the edge of a straight, 
European-style avenue cut through the city by French colonizers in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
"They stopped here; they didn't go further, thanks be to God," said the 
architect, who has devoted his life to preserving Old Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
A 14th-Century tomb of the Mamelukes has been rented to a cloth merchant, who 
destroyed the original lintel and cut a door through an ancient wall to allow 
access to his shop. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless we propose a solution to blend those monuments with the commercial life 
of the Old City of Damascus, this is the way it all will go," Kawakibi said. 
</P>
<P>
"These buildings shouldn't function as commercial buildings, but as museums or 
cultural centers. They're all registered as historical monuments, but the law 
hasn't been able to prevent them from being transgressed." 
</P>
<P>
In one old mosque, the antique wooden minbar, or preacher's stand, was ripped 
out and left in the entrance, to be replaced by a concrete one. 
</P>
<P>
An architectural gem, the 11th-Century Nur ed-Din hospital, is sandwiched 
between a modern shop selling shwarma, thinly sliced meat wrapped in Arabic 
bread, and a jewelry store. It was restored in the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Parasitic buildings accumulated around it, but they're now just part of the 
ambience," said Kawakibi, who was instrumental in the renovation. 
</P>
<P>
Only one of the original stone-lattice windows, carved in intricate geometric 
designs, had survived. Master craftsmen copied it faithfully. 
</P>
<P>
A few painted Koranic inscriptions remained on the domed ceilings. Instead of 
repainting them, restorers gently penciled in missing portions of the holy 
book's text. 
</P>
<P>
In a display case are ancient herbal medicines, including one called 
"aphrodisiac radish, diuretic, activates the functions of the genital glands." 
</P>
<P>
The hospital and dozens of other old buildings are tranquil havens in a 
bustling, noisy city, as are the 11th-Century baths, reached through a small 
door in the midst of the bazaar. 
</P>
<P>
The baths saw hard times, even becoming a soap factory at one point. 
</P>
<P>
Now, men swaddled in towels sip at glasses of boiling-hot tea after a searing 
bath and massage. They read their newspapers beneath a dome painted with 
complicated flowery designs. 
</P>
<P>
Renovation is not always popular. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're trying to renovate these buildings, there's a lot of protest 
because they don't understand what is meant by renovation," Kawakibi said. 
"They think you mean destroying the old buildings and putting up new ones." 
</P>
<P>
At the Masjid al-Madrassah al-Umariyah mosque and school complex, which dates 
from the time of the First Crusade in the 11th Century, dozens of squatters who 
built concrete huts on the grounds are being evicted. 
</P>
<P>
In deciding how to proceed, restorers rely on old drawings, their knowledge of 
the architectural practices of the time and photographs from the 19th and early 
20th centuries. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, the government and experts drew up a master plan for the city, 
which included providing modern services and preserving the Old City. It has 
become hopelessly outdated. 
</P>
<P>
Even a devoted restorationist like Kawakibi acknowledges that "attention should 
be paid to modern problems more than old ones. We need infrastructure, 
telephones, transportation."

GOVERNMENT OF SINGAPORE TRIES ITS HAND AT MATCHMAKING TO BOOST ITS POPULATION 
</P>

SINGAPORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The government has established three separate agencies to persuade people to 
get married, a typical function in most other societies of matchmakers, aunts 
and neighborhood busybodies. 
</P>
<P>
The latest is the Social Promotion Section, which organizes social activities 
where school dropouts ages 20 to 35 can meet. About 150,000 of Singapore's 2.6 
million people are in that category. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to mix around with members and help them break the ice between them 
with my personality," said David Chua, 35, head of the new agency. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make them talk to each other. I have to see myself as a matchmaker. 
I can't just sit back and watch, hoping they will fall in love." 
</P>
<P>
His agency plans to sponsor dances, barbecues, group travel and courses in 
personal development. 
</P>
<P>
It joins the Social Development Unit, created by Dr. Eileen Aw in 1984 for 
single college graduates, and the Social Development Section, run by Sam Tan, 
which was formed in 1985 to promote marriage among high school graduates. 
</P>
<P>
Early skeptics described the Social Development Unit as a bureaucratic lonely 
hearts club for the "single, desperate and ugly." With the resources of the 
Ministry of Finance behind it, however, the organization made steady progress 
in Singapore's conservative society. 
</P>
<P>
A declining birthrate and charges of elitism prompted the government to widen a 
matchmaking program that originally served only civil servants with university 
degrees. Critics say it still smacks of discrimination, since the groups served 
are segregated by education qualifications. 
</P>
<P>
About 9,700 members belong to the original agency, and it claims credit for 
more than 570 marriages. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, the Social Development Section for high school 
graduates had 48,000 members, and more than 7,280 former members had married. 
</P>
<P>
Married women were caught trying to sneak into that group, so the new Social 
Promotion Section will check up on applicants. 
</P>
<P>
The government created the first of its matchmaking bureaus after Prime 
Minister Lee Kuan Yew said in 1983 that Singapore might be doomed by a 
deteriorating talent pool because too many educated women remain single and 
childless. 
</P>
<P>
"Levels of competence will decline," he declared. "Our economy will falter, the 
administration will suffer and society will decline." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem was that Singapore's men preferred to marry women less 
educated than they, while women wanted to marry upward.

ROMANIANS MOVE UPTOWN INTO APARTMENTS BUILT FOR MINIONS OF SLAIN DICTATOR

Aurelia Brener has only one complaint about her spacious new home -- the view 
from the balcony. "When I look in that direction I seem to see him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She was referring to executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. From her fifth-floor 
balcony Brener has a view of the 450-room Palace of the Republic that Ceausescu 
built for his personal glorification. 
</P>
<P>
Since the uprising in December that ousted Ceausescu, hundreds of ordinary 
Romanians have left cramped, run-down flats for brand new apartments like 
Brener's on the tree-lined boulevard that leads to the towering white palace. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-story apartment buildings, built for Ceausescu's communist elite, 
were ready for occupancy two years ago, but they remained empty while an army 
of workers toiled on the still unfinished palace, conceived as the seat of 
government and now expected to be turned into a conference center. 
</P>
<P>
Today the apartments' stone balconies are a colorful mosaic of washing hung out 
to dry by Romanians whom Ceausescu starved of food, heat and light to fund his 
mammoth building project. 
</P>
<P>
"We would never have had a chance to live here before," said Brener, 50, a 
hospital administrator who moved in four months ago with her retired husband, 
their son and daughter-in-law and the family poodle. 
</P>
<P>
"This one would probably have gone to someone big in the Securitate (secret 
police) or maybe a junior minister," she said of her new home in a city said to 
need some 50,000 apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Her family swapped a dingy flat on the outskirts of the capital for one almost 
double the size with five rooms and two bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"Our bedroom in the old flat was so small you had to hold your breath and 
squeeze past the wardrobe to get into bed," she said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
The rent, based on space and means, also virtually doubled -- to about $37 a 
month -- but the apartment is worth it, Brener said. 
</P>
<P>
"If it went up for sale, we'd buy it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Parquet and ceramic-tiled floors, glass-paneled interior doors and double-glass 
windows to keep out the biting winter cold are standard. 
</P>
<P>
And, while the finish is poor by Western standards, the apartments seem 
luxurious to most Romanians, who are herded into buildings so badly built that 
often they do not stand up straight. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu demolished thousands of houses and several historic buildings to make 
way for the apartments, public buildings and his palace -- a complex he dubbed 
the Civic Center.

TUNA BOATS' TOLL OF DOLPHINS STILL RUNS HIGH IN WATERS OFF COSTA RICA; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATION: FOREIGN VESSELS CONTINUE THEIR TUNA FISHING PRACTICES DESPITE 
BOYCOTT BY THREE AMERICAN COMPANIES. STILL, THE ACTION SEEMS TO BE HAVING AN 
EFFECT.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The three largest tuna companies in the U.S. market scored a public relations 
victory recently when they announced that they would stop buying tuna caught by 
netting dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
In the waters off Costa Rica, however, thousands of miles south of where 
Starkist, Bumble Bee and Chicken of the Sea made their pronouncements, dolphins 
are still being killed, largely by foreign tuna fishermen oblivious to or 
uncaring of the conservationist concerns of the American public. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing will happen until inspectors go on the ships and start enforcing it," 
said Gerardo Huertas, the Costa Rican representative for the World Society for 
the Protection of Animals. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Costa Rican Agriculture Ministry, 60,000 tons of tuna are 
caught in Costa Rica's territorial waters each year. Much of it is taken by 
boats flagged by Mexico, Ecuador, Panama, Venezuela and Vanuatu. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica itself has none of the large tuna boats most responsible for methods 
that kill dolphin, but the country collects about $2 million annually in fees 
from foreign tuna boats fishing in its waters and selling part of their catch 
to U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
Huertas said that in the Western Hemisphere, only Mexican waters produce more 
tuna than Costa Rican waters, where most tuna is caught by netting dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons not fully understood, dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific -- 
the coastal waters from California to Chile -- swim with schools of tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Many large tuna boats search for dolphins, herd them together with cherry bombs 
dropped from helicopters, then send out speedboats to encircle the area in a 
huge net tied to the main boat that scoops up everything in its path. 
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of dolphins die each year from getting caught in the nets and 
drowning. 
</P>
<P>
Amid conservationist concerns and U.S. boycotts, Starkist, Chicken of the Sea 
and Bumble Bee announced April 12 that they would stop buying tuna caught with 
dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the assertions by Huertas, Chicken of the Sea spokeswoman Mitch 
Meyers in St. Louis noted that the firm -- affiliated with Indonesian-owned Van 
Camp Seafood -- buys only from U.S.-flagged boats, which are virtually all 
accompanied by U.S. government observers. 
</P>
<P>
"Our contract states we won't buy tuna caught on dolphin," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Starkist spokesman Erik Bloemendaal in Long Beach said his company, an 
affiliate of H. J. Heinz in Pittsburgh, buys from foreign and U.S. vessels. He 
said its policy applies to boats that left port after April 12 and "our policy 
is not to buy any tuna caught in association with dolphin." 
</P>
<P>
He said while there are "not enough" international observers on foreign boats, 
Starkist would buy only tuna "certified dolphin safe." 
</P>
<P>
"That's not to say other canners couldn't," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bumble Bee, a Thai-owned company, has said it needs as long as six months to 
end its contractual obligations before starting the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
Huertas did not name companies buying locally caught tuna and had no figures on 
how much tuna they purchase. But he said any boat could claim not to fish with 
dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
"The companies can try not to buy tuna with dolphin blood on it, but that's a 
very difficult thing to do," he said, adding that the only enforcement 
inspectors have is to report dolphin killers to tuna companies. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision not to buy dolphin tuna will reduce the amount of killing some, 
but it will depend on how many inspectors they have," Huertas said. 
</P>
<P>
The boycott of dolphin-caught tuna was not well received by Costa Rica's tuna 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It's upsetting the whole industry, including myself," said Stewart Heigold, 
who owns Tesoro del Mar, one of two Costa Rican tuna canneries that sell some 
of their product to U.S. distributors. "They (Bumble Bee, Starkist and Chicken 
of the Sea) are the three most important tuna companies in the world." 
</P>
<P>
But Heigold said he would buy tuna from anyone because his main market is in 
Costa Rica, where the public is not concerned with conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he added Costa Rica is "going to have to make laws" against fishing with 
dolphins because, "If we don't, we are going to be sanctioned, and if I try to 
sell my tuna to the United States, I will be turned away." 
</P>
<P>
Heigold said enforced regulations could prompt different fishing methods. 
</P>
<P>
But Huertas said many boats would move to Mexican waters because "Mexico does 
not care about it. . . . They just do whatever they want." 
</P>
<P>
Heigold said the U.S. boycott of dolphin tuna is also driving down the 
international market price for tuna sold by boats openly using the dolphin 
method. 
</P>
<P>
During most of the 1970s, when accurate figures became available, most dolphins 
killed by tuna boats were killed by U.S.-flagged vessels. In 1972, more than 
368,000 dolphins were killed by U.S. vessels, compared to 55,000 by non-U.S. 
vessels, according to U.S. government statistics. 
</P>
<P>
But with conservationist pressure and regulations such as the U.S. Marine 
Mammal Protection Act, American boats have been legally held to fewer than 
20,500 dolphin deaths for several years. 
</P>
<P>
However, many boats simply changed nationalities, and by 1986 the number of 
dolphins killed by non-U.S. vessels was more than 100,000.

WESTERN CULTURE SWEEPS THE BARREN REACHES OF MONGOLIA

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The music takes on a Latin beat. The dancers glue their bodies together. They 
are doing -- yes, the lambada, the provocative Brazilian dance that is the rage 
in the West. 
</P>
<P>
The lambada? In Ulan Bator? In Mongolia? 
</P>
<P>
"Why not?" said Suhjargalmaa, a top editor at the official Montsame News 
Agency. "We knew about the Beatles as soon as they appeared." 
</P>
<P>
Not only the Beatles, but such rock and pop stars as Prince, Pink Floyd, Phil 
Collins and Paula Abdul have big followings among the hip urban youth of this 
Communist-ruled nation of shepherds. Tapes are carried in from Eastern Europe, 
for decades Mongolia's door to the world. 
</P>
<P>
But now, with the Cold War receding into history and Mongolia learning glasnost 
and perestroika from its Soviet mentor, Mongolians are eager for direct contact 
with the non-socialist world. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were to stand here and shout out that you are an American, probably a 
lot of people would crowd around just to see what you are like," said my 
translator, Orgil, a 27-year-old Foreign Ministry worker who learned his fluent 
English in Moscow. Like most Mongolians, he uses only one name. 
</P>
<P>
After decades of letting in but a few Western journalists, the Foreign Ministry 
welcomed dozens early this year to witness Mongolia's first steps toward 
multiparty elections expected this summer. 
</P>
<P>
It drafted nearly every English speaker in Ulan Bator to serve as translators 
and set up special phone and telex lines that eased, but did not eliminate, 
problems in contacting the outside world. It even arranged news conferences 
with the country's brand-new opposition parties. 
</P>
<P>
Geographically, historically and politically, Mongolia still hovers in 
uncharted territory between its Stalinist past and hoped-for democratic future. 
Geographically, it stands along the Chinese-Soviet border where it harbors the 
Gobi Desert. Long under Chinese influence, it slipped into the Soviet sphere 
relatively recently. Historic home of the Mongol hordes that swept Europe, it 
uses the Greek-derived Cyrillic alphabet of the Slavic countries and the Soviet 
Union. Contradictions abound. They always have. 
</P>
<P>
For example, among our translators were several people identified by their 
colleagues or opposition party members as having secret police connections. 
</P>
<P>
The words "Long Live the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party," the formal 
name of the Communists, still dominate a hillside over Ulan Bator in yards-high 
stone letters -- evidence that the party believes in loosening up but not 
giving up. 
</P>
<P>
The close Soviet Bloc tie is another part of the past that won't easily be 
erased. It is stamped on the face of Ulan Bator -- in the stolid Soviet-style 
buildings, the central square that imitates Red Square, the Soviet-made Volga 
and Lada cars. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Soviets who taught Mongolians to eat potatoes and bread and drink 
vodka with their traditional mutton. Television viewers can pick from 
Mongolia's one station or the Soviet channel. Almost all trade is with the 
Soviet Union or its other allies -- shops sell Czech beer, Bulgarian pickle 
relish and East German fashion magazines. 
</P>
<P>
The blond men dancing with the lonely wives of Soviet soldiers in the Hotel 
Ulan Bator's bar are Polish, Ukrainian and East German black marketeers, 
profiting from the shortages left by state-planned economies up and down the 
Trans-Siberian Railroad. They bring Chinese consumer goods to Ulan Bator and 
Mongolian cashmere to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The East Bloc connection has Europeanized urban Mongolians, giving them a 
cosmopolitan air absent from the neighboring socialist capitals of Beijing and 
Pyongyang. Nowhere in Beijing is there a bartender like bow-tied Arslan of the 
Hotel Ulan Bator, who serves up nightly political commentary in English, 
German, Russian and a little Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
For this European polish, Suhjargalmaa said Mongolians should be grateful to 
former dictator Yumjaagiyn Tsedenbal, who married a Soviet woman and made 
Mongolian-Soviet friendship a matter of dogma. But hers is a minority view. 
</P>
<P>
My chief concern on the streets was not to be mistaken for a Russian, so as to 
avoid the cold stares, poor service and hissed obscenities directed at them. 
</P>
<P>
"People are fed up" with everything Soviet, one local resident said. Mongolians 
are reveling in a new surge of nationalism with Genghis Khan, the 13th-Century 
warrior king, as their hero. 
</P>
<P>
Two hit rock songs sing the khan's praises. Artists and scholars recently 
formed a society called "Genghis Khan's Tent" to revive traditional culture. A 
taxi driver pasted a color picture of Genghis Khan like a holy card on the 
dashboard of his Soviet sedan. 
</P>
<P>
The party newspaper, Unen, now prints its name in Mongolia's ancient script as 
well as in the Cyrillic letters forcibly introduced in the 1940s. Schools offer 
night courses in the old script to young adults raised on Cyrillic. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers wonder if the government is encouraging traditionalism to divert 
attention from modern problems, such as economic stagnation and rising crime. 
</P>
<P>
A leading economist disclosed in April that more than half of Mongolia's 2 
million people earn only the minimum wage of 260 tugriks a month or less -- 
about U.S. $46. 
</P>
<P>
Industrial production fell early in the year as workers took advantage of the 
political thaw to stage slowdowns and illegal strikes. Housing, consumer goods 
and even meat, one of Mongolia's chief products, are perennially in short 
supply. 
</P>

"Sometimes in summer we can't get meat for two or three weeks," said Orig, a 
retired teacher in the tiny rural town of Hugar, southwest of Ulan Bator. He 
said the town hopes to open a free market soon, adding, "This will help solve 
the shortages." 
</P>
<P>
But even Ulan Bator's twice-weekly free market offers slim pickings to the 
thousands who visit it. They file hopefully past stalls that display small 
heaps of salvaged screws and bolts, rusty saws and screwdrivers, homemade 
picture frames and a broken television valuable for its parts. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the customers come from nearby settlements of shanties and gers -- 
traditional felt tents known better in the West by their Turkish name, yurts. 
Stark and colorless, the ger-towns stretch across treeless, grassless hills on 
Ulan Bator's fringes. 
</P>
<P>
Children play ball in the dirt. Residents carry buckets to communal faucets but 
dig their own toilets -- sometimes badly, as small rivulets of leaking sewage 
testify. 
</P>
<P>
Small wonder that the ger-towns are the cradle of youth gangs with names like 
the "Gray Wolves," that fight each other and are blamed for a recent surge in 
muggings and rapes. Foreign Ministry staff members warned me against walking 
alone at night, even in the city center. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the ruling party nor the half a dozen new opposition groups has offered 
a practical blueprint for dealing with these economic and social problems. 
</P>
<P>
Political wrangling has absorbed much of their energies. Already, the leading 
opposition group, the Mongolian Democratic Assn. and its affiliated party, has 
purged its top ranks twice amid charges of personal ambition. 
</P>
<P>
Rural dwellers make up only 37% of Mongolia's population, but in this summer's 
legislative elections they will have the decisive say. The ruling party, 
strongest in the countryside, recently gave them more legislative seats than 
city dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
How much they understand or care about the recent political changes remains to 
be seen. 
</P>
<P>
I asked Gonchig, a 61-year-old semi-nomadic herder in rural Uvurhangai 
province, what he thought of the opposition hunger strike in March that forced 
the Communists to give up their constitutional hold on power. 
</P>
<P>
"We understood that it wasn't that they didn't have enough to eat, that they 
were making political demands," Gonchig said chuckling. "Of course, to some 
extent they are crazy." 
</P>
<P>
He follows developments sketchily via radio reports and copies of Unen 
delivered to his ger once a week by pony express. 
</P>
<P>
Out in the rolling grasslands, away from Ulan Bator's incessant political 
debates, it is easy to share Gonchig's priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"The sight of white sheep against the green pasture is really quite lovely," 
said Orgil, city born and bred. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed it is lovely, even when seen from a Soviet jeep that is hurtling across 
the open steppe, bumping through ruts and rivers.

DEPRESSION-ERA TUNNEL PROJECT STILL TAKES TOLL ON WORKERS, MANY OF THEM BLACK

<TEXT>
<P>
Arthur Stull's every labored breath reminds him of the silica dust he inhaled 
60 years ago while working on the Hawks Nest Tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
Historians say up to 700 men, most of them black, died of silicosis and other 
lung problems after working on the aqueduct, bored through a deposit of nearly 
pure silica in Gauley Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Other men, like Stull, survived but still are suffering decades later from the 
effects of silica dust. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no protection from it," said the 78-year-old Stull, who lives in 
nearby Mt. Lookout. "Work was scarce then. You couldn't find work anywhere, 
hardly. You had to take what you could get." 
</P>
<P>
Work on the 3.8-mile aqueduct, about 40 miles east of Charleston, began 60 
years ago last month . Born in the bleak days of the Great Depression, the 
project proved to be one of the darkest moments of U.S. industrial history. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel was built by Union Carbide Corp. through a contractor, Rinehart 
&amp; Dennis Construction Co. of Charlottesville, Va. The purpose: Divert the 
New River to a power station used at a Union Carbide smelting plant in nearby 
Alloy. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Cherniack, a Yale University assistant professor of occupational 
medicine, studied the case and wrote "The Hawks Nest Incident" in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Crews blasted a 31-foot-wide tunnel through almost pure silica, a glassy 
substance found in sand and quartz. The tunnel's width was then nearly doubled 
to cash in on the silica, so pure that it could be used without refining at the 
alloy plant, according to Cherniack. The whole project took about two years. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after work began, many workers began complaining of hacking coughs and 
searing chest pains. The average worker stayed on the job just 15 to 16 weeks, 
Cherniack said. 
</P>
<P>
A company doctor at the time called the condition "tunnelitis" and gave the men 
tablets nicknamed "little black devils." 
</P>
<P>
Many didn't quit in time. An undertaker was paid $55 each to remove and bury 
bodies in a mass grave near Summersville. Congressional records say 169 men 
eventually were buried there. 
</P>
<P>
But with jobs hard to find, reports that workers were dying failed to deter 
others. Men who died or fell sick and refused to go back to work in the tunnel 
were easily replaced. 
</P>
<P>
The number who died while working on the tunnel or died later of lung diseases 
is only a guess because many of the more than 4,000 workers were migrants and 
left the area. Estimates range up to 700. 
</P>
<P>
Lengthy exposure to silica causes hard nodules to form in lungs until scar 
tissue replaces healthy tissue, leaving little room to breathe. Tuberculosis 
and pneumonia often develop. 
</P>
<P>
The hazards of silica dust were known to civil and mining engineers in the 
1930s, although company officials later claimed they did not know of the 
dangers. 
</P>
<P>
Cherniack concluded that racism was a factor in the deaths. More than 75% of 
the workers were black migrants who came from across the South. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote of "a widespread attitude of condescension, if not contempt, toward 
the blacks." Many whites believed that the workers were dying not because of 
silica dust but because of poor nutrition or a propensity to violence. 
</P>
<P>
"In spite of all the evidence to the contrary, some people still say that 
knifings, shootings, and beatings took the greatest toll," Cherniack wrote. 
"Gambling out of doors before open fires in the cold is another supposed cause 
of death." 
</P>
<P>
About 300 survivors and relatives filed lawsuits against Rinehart &amp; Dennis. 
They eventually received $130,000, half of which went to lawyers. Rinehart 
&amp; Dennis, now defunct, admitted no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
A 1936 House Labor Committee investigation into the deaths brought unwelcome 
notoriety to Gauley Bridge. It became known as "The Town of the Living Dead" 
because of the many disabled workers who remained there until they died. 
</P>
<P>
Townspeople resented outside interest in the tragedy. Researchers had 
difficulty finding cooperative sources and sometimes were threatened, Cherniack 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And in an unrelated dispute, federal authorities contended in a lawsuit that 
Union Carbide should have sought federal permission before diverting a 
navigable waterway. The U.S. Supreme Court eventually decided in favor of the 
government in that dispute. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel is now owned by Elkem Metals Co. of Pittsburgh, which bought it, 
along with the power plant and alloy factory, from Union Carbide in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Stull said he was lucky because he apparently was assigned to a part of the 
tunnel with the least amount of silica. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, the dust led to pneumonia and surgery to remove part of 
his lung shortly after he stopped working on the tunnel. Doctors blame the 
silica dust for his current lung problems. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the dust, tunnel workers coped with gas from vehicles that carried the 
rock and steel from the tunnel, he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"Some days the light would get awful red looking," Stull said. "You could tell 
there was gas. . . . We just went ahead and worked. You just got used to it and 
didn't pay much attention."

RUSSIA: THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE VIOLENT DEMISE OF THE COUNTRY'S LAST MONARCH 
ARE BEING QUESTIONED MORE INTENSELY.

<P>
A planned movie chronicles his tragic reign, a hit play depicts his brutal 
death at the hands of the Bolsheviks, and black marketeers hawk his portrait 
all over Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-three years after he abdicated, Czar Nicholas II is back in vogue. 
</P>
<P>
On May Day, monarchist backers even paraded a portrait of Nicholas II through 
Red Square in front of the disbelieving eyes of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Later in May, monarchist advocates sat beneath a portrait of the czar to 
officially found a Monarchist Party to compete in the country's new multiparty 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Nelli Milovanova, 30, a programmer and member of a club to perpetuate the 
memory of the czar, is helping prepare the platform of a Monarchist Party in an 
Orthodox Christian Russia. 
</P>
<P>
"The Russians are real Christians, believers in the Orthodox religion, they 
have the idea of monarchy in their souls," said Milovanova. 
</P>
<P>
"Russians are waiting for freedom," she said. "The party program is aimed at 
restoration of the monarchy by peaceful means, through achieving a majority in 
the Parliament and transition of the power to an Assembly of the Land, which is 
the only legal institution that can call the czar to the throne." 
</P>
<P>
There are 16 male descendants of the imperial Romanov dynasty scattered around 
the world. At present the monarchists' leading contender to the throne is Grand 
Duke Vladimir Kirolovich, great grandson of Alexander II, who lives in France. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Ogonek magazine, always on the cutting edge of the latest rage, 
carried an interview with the grand duke. 
</P>
<P>
One royal descendant has already visited Russia, with the gossipy yellow-press 
Trud newspaper supplying the details and even a picture of the blue-blooded 
personage. 
</P>
<P>
The visit this spring was by David Chevchavardze, a great grandson of Emperor 
Nicholas I, but now an American citizen who fought in the U.S. Army in World 
War II. The magazine Literaturnaya Gazeta said he then went to work for the 
CIA, enjoying a 25-year distinguished career there. 
</P>
<P>
The recent curiosity about Russia's last czar emerged when Gorbachev in 1985 
urged an end to all "blank spots" in the country's history that it had been 
forbidden to explore or write about. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like reading a detective story, and you never get to the end because 
there is always something unsaid -- like why was the czar killed, who ordered 
it," said Yuri, a young foreign ministry official. 
</P>
<P>
Zhenya, his friend, traces the intense interest and rediscovery to glasnost 
through Russian eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to understand our history was ripped out," he said. "People want to 
know who ordered this crime -- and it was a crime -- of murdering innocents. 
People are also rediscovering their past -- flags, symbols and the czar." 
</P>
<P>
Interest in the violent demise of Russia's last monarch surged after last 
April's sensational revelation in the Moscow News that his skull had been found 
in a pit near a swamp in Sverdlovsk in the Urals. 
</P>
<P>
That same pit yielded the bones of his wife, Czarina Alexandra, Crown Prince 
Czarevich Alexis and their four daughters. Nicholas II and his family were shot 
by Bolshevik gunmen in a basement of a merchant's house in Ekaterinenburg, now 
Sverdlovsk. 
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made by former policeman-turned-crime writer, Geli Ryabel, 
who said he found the gruesome remains 10 years earlier but was forbidden to 
publish the result of his find. 
</P>
<P>
"The times were different then and nobody would undertake to identify the 
skulls and bones," Ryabov said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, interest abounds. 
</P>
<P>
One of the country's most famous movie directors, Gleb Panfilov, is planning a 
film on Czar Nicholas Romanov's last days. 
</P>
<P>
On Moscow street corners, the czar's picture is sold along with copies of the 
new independent newspapers -- no more than leaflets in some cases -- that are 
popping up all over the country as part of Russia's political reawakening. 
</P>
<P>
A new play, "I Will Repay," re-creating the murder of the czar, is playing to 
full houses nightly in the Maly theater. 
</P>
<P>
Written by an obscure author Sergei Kuznetsov, the play is hardly a classical 
drama and features some wooden acting. 
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless," said the Moscow News, "for 2 1/2 hours, the audience follows 
the action with bated breath. The subject is really fascinating." 
</P>
<P>
Little wonder. It addresses such questions as whether the czar was killed 
because White Russian forces fighting the Bolsheviks were about to capture him 
and use him as a counterrevolutionary symbol to rally forces and bring down the 
communists. 
</P>
<P>
Even more volatile, it explores the question of whether local Jewish commissars 
carried out the killings without the knowledge of Soviet leader V. I. Lenin. 
The anti-Semitic Pamyat organization blames Jews for the czar's death and 
demands retribution. Soviet history books make no mention of a role by Lenin. 
</P>
<P>
Yuri Mitunov, a Moscow political activist who works for Radio Liberty, says 
interest in the czar and his death stems from growing anti-communist sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
"It is because it was the very first crime of the Bolsheviks and then the 
hypocrisy about it," he said. "That is why we are returning to the study of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
A picture published in Moscow News of the skull of imperial Russia's last 
monarch spawned a host of monarchist clubs and informal nationalist 
organizations, dedicated to finding the truth about how the czar and his family 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
"The aim of our society is to commemorate the memory of Nicholas II to clean 
his name of all the dirt which has been poured on it by Bolsheviks," said 
Milovanova, the Monarchist Party worker also active in a nationwide commission 
on the czar. 
</P>
<P>
The more rabidly nationalistic groups are demanding that the czar be given a 
decent burial in the St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Leningrad, which was 
formerly the imperial capital of St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
They also seek to build a cathedral on the site of the house where the imperial 
family was slaughtered. The house was ordered razed during the rule of Leonid 
Brezhnev. Boris Yeltsin, now a populist hero, was made to carry out the 
destruction when he was the Communist Party first secretary in Sverdlovsk. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas himself was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church because of his 
martyr's death, and Russian religious tradition calls for such a "cathedral in 
blood" at the site of martyrdom. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the more politically minded monarchist groups, claiming the support 
of as many as 22 million Russians, are gearing up to test the waters of the new 
multiparty pond. 
</P>
<P>
"Only the monarchy can make make Russia a great power," Milovanova said. "Ten 
percent of the population support us."

NEW TEST MAY TRACE SOURCE OF HARBOR'S PCB CONTAMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists studying PCB pollution of the sediment underlying Los Angeles Harbor 
are attempting to use a new type of chemical analysis to track down the sources 
of the contamination. 
</P>
<P>
Chemists with the Southern California Coastal Water Research Project are 
centering their efforts on harbor sediment near a giant Terminal Island 
metal-shredding facility, site of the worst PCB pollution found so far. 
</P>
<P>
The study employs a method of analysis that can identify different types of 
PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls. PCBs are toxic chemicals that were used in 
products ranging from lubricants to electric transformers until their 
manufacture was banned in 1979. They are suspected of causing cancer in humans. 
</P>
<P>
Now nearing completion, the study was commissioned in 1988 by the state 
Regional Water Quality Control Board. Board staffers say that although PCB 
pollution in the harbor has been known since the early 1970s, the new technique 
may for the first time allow them to pinpoint those who should be made 
responsible for cleaning it up. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of formulations of (PCBs)," said Robert Ghirelli, the 
board's staff director. "Without this fingerprinting technique, it is very 
difficult and in some cases impossible to show that the chemical in the water 
originated from a particular onshore location." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists applaud the effort. They admit that PCB pollution should be 
expected in water bodies like Los Angeles Harbor, for decades the site of 
intense waterfront industrial activity. But they point out that PCBs threaten 
to contaminate marine life there, some of which serves as a local food source. 
</P>
<P>
"Like it or not, there are subsistence fishermen who fish the harbor," said 
biologist Mark Gold of Save the Bay, a Santa Monica environmental group. "And 
fish don't stay in one place. They move around." 
</P>
<P>
The new technique of PCB analysis was developed by Robert Eganhouse, a chemist 
with the Coastal Water Research Project, a public marine research agency. It 
allows scientists to distinguish among PCBs, complex mixtures of 40 to 70 
distinct compounds, by identifying and measuring their chemical components. 
</P>
<P>
The research project is using the technique to analyze samples from more than a 
dozen harbor locations in hopes of determining whether pollution of the 
underlying sediment can be linked to contamination from facilities on the 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
But chemists are focusing most of their attention on the Hugo Neu-Proler Co., 
on the north side of Terminal Island, which shreds discarded metal products 
ranging from cars to refrigerators and loads the scrap onto ships for export. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the harbor's PCB contamination is believed to stem from 
pollution that occurred more than a decade ago, officials fear that PCBs could 
be entering the harbor today as discarded goods containing them are processed 
at Neu-Proler. 
</P>
<P>
In operation since 1962, the company says it grinds up more than 700 
automobiles and 3,000 household appliances daily to help fuel scrap exports 
amounting to more than 1 million tons a year. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor sediment near the scrap yard registered by far the highest PCB levels 
found in the study, in which samples were gathered at more than a dozen harbor 
locations. 
</P>
<P>
A sample of sediment taken near a conveyor that loads the scrap onto ships 
registered concentrations of 11.5 parts per million, well above the next 
highest level, 1.87 parts per million, detected near the former Todd Shipyards. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew there were high concentrations in the harbor, but we didn't know about 
Neu-Proler," said Richard Gossett, the chemist in charge of the study. "These 
levels (near) the conveyor area are about five times higher than what I've seen 
elsewhere in the harbor." 
</P>
<P>
The levels also outstrip those in an area of known PCB contamination outside 
the harbor: the ocean bottom near the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts' 
sewage outfalls off the Palos Verdes Peninsula. According to Gossett, the 
highest concentrations measured there recently were 1.5 million parts per 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Gossett says his analysis shows that the PCBs found off Neu-Proler are "very 
dissimilar" to samples his agency took from the other harbor sampling sites. 
But they exhibit strong similarities to the PCBs in debris collected on land 
directly under the loading conveyor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say (the connection) looks very strong," Gossett said last week. "They 
were very similar." In an interview, Eganhouse said he agrees with Gossett's 
appraisal. 
</P>
<P>
Shirley Birosik, a water board staff member monitoring the harbor study, takes 
a more conservative view, saying that a final test Gossett is conducting must 
be completed before her agency can begin to reach conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
The test will determine whether tiny particles on the water's surface near 
Neu-Proler carry the same type of PCBs found on the shore and in the underlying 
sediment. After that test, Gossett will submit a final report to the regional 
water board's staff, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"Our staff will evaluate their report," Ghirelli said. "If in fact the evidence 
does point to a linkage between what was found in the sediment and the material 
on shore, then the board would have evidence to go ahead and order a cleanup." 
</P>
<P>
Hugo Neu-Proler General Manager John Prudent said his company will not comment 
in detail on the PCB investigation until the study is finished. But he 
indicated that the company would be willing to take cleanup action if it is 
found to be causing the pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be ready to cooperate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say it is unclear whether funding will be available for tracing other 
possible sources of PCB contamination in the harbor once the Hugo Neu-Proler 
survey is complete. Even if such projects are funded, they would face serious 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, PCBs at many locations in the harbor are intermingled in a 
confusing jumble or are too degraded chemically to identify with precision. 
Still, officials are hopeful that further PCB sleuthing could establish links 
between underwater pollution and onshore sources. 
</P>
<P>
One possibility, for instance, would be to trace the origin of contamination 
that has apparently emanated from the Dominguez Channel. That would involve 
analyzing PCBs found in channel sediment and at polluted sites along the banks 
to see whether there is a connection. 
</P>
<P>
Ghirelli said that even if a suspected polluter is no longer in business, solid 
evidence of a link between sediment contamination and an onshore facility would 
give the water board grounds to take regulatory action against the former 
operator. 
</P>
<P>
Said Ghirelli: "We'd have the smoking gun." 
</P>
<P>
PCB LEVELS IN LOS ANGELES HARBOR 
</P>
<P>
A study of PCB pollution levels in the sediment underlying Los Angeles Harbor 
turned up extremely high concentrations of the chemical off the Hugo Neu-Proler 
metal shredding facility on Terminal Island. High PCB levels were also detected 
in sediment near the former Todd Shipyards and in the Consolidated Slip/East 
Basin area.

WYOMING RANCHER BATTLES STATE OVER PLANS FOR EXOTIC ANIMALS

<TEXT>
<P>
Millionaire rancher John T. Dorrance III is battling the state of Wyoming over 
the concept of exotic game ranching. 
</P>
<P>
Some wildlife managers predict that game ranching will be an issue of 
increasing controversy in Western states in the coming years, and so far the 
battle is not going well for Dorrance. 
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old Missouri native, whose share of the Campbell's Soup fortune is 
estimated at $660 million by Forbes Magazine, wants to bring to his ranch near 
Devils Tower National Monument about 100 animals from 15 exotic species and 24 
animals from four native Wyoming species. 
</P>
<P>
The species include arctic wolves; Russian boar; red, roe, sika, axis and 
fallow deer; ibex; muntjac; markhor; blackbuck; chamois, and Barbary, mouflon 
and Marco Polo sheep. The native species he seeks are moose, elk, pronghorn 
antelope and bighorn sheep. 
</P>
<P>
Dorrance wants to set aside about 4,200 acres of his 17,000-acre ranch for a 
drive-through wildlife park and to use the animals for hunting, meat production 
and research on controlling leafy spurge, a virulent weed crowding out natural 
vegetation on some western ranges. 
</P>
<P>
The Wyoming Game and Fish Commission, citing the threat to native wildlife, has 
rejected the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
But Dorrance -- one of the richest men in America -- gives every indication 
that he is not inclined to accept the decision unchallenged or give up his 
20-year dream of an exotic game ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got three or four options," he said. "We can accept it, we can take it 
into the court system, attack it legislatively to seek some changes in the 
Wyoming statutes or a combination of the last two." 
</P>
<P>
He also said he could pursue the ranch in South Dakota or another state with 
less restrictive laws. 
</P>
<P>
Dorrance stressed that he plans to fully evaluate the financial requirements of 
his game ranch options before taking further action. 
</P>
<P>
"If we pursue it and win we are still faced with the Wyoming Game and Fish 
Department," he said. "They might be very bitter and vindictive. They could 
make our life impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Game and Fish Commission President Don Scott said there was nothing personal in 
the decision, noting that Wyoming law specifically prohibits private 
importation or possession of native big game animals and bans import of a 
living wolf from any source. 
</P>
<P>
The permit request for importing the exotics was more controversial, Scott 
said, but the decision was still clear-cut because of the threats of disease, 
hybridization and competition for habitat. 
</P>
<P>
He said the commission's responsibility is to protect the state's wildlife, and 
his mail on the issue has run about 150 to 1 against Dorrance's plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We have wild and free-ranging herds that are truly a national treasure and we 
just don't believe that that treasure should be placed in jeopardy -- even a 
remote jeopardy," he said. "We don't want to turn Wyoming into Texas." 
</P>
<P>
Texas has the most widespread exotic game ranching in the nation, and Scott 
said discussions with wildlife managers in states that allow such ranching 
indicates "they wish they'd never let them in." 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the National Wildlife Federation and its Wyoming chapter said they 
share the Wyoming department's concerns and support its denial of the game 
ranching permits. 
</P>
<P>
"Those states that have it are quickly scrambling to see how they can undo what 
they've already done," said Tom Dougherty, the federation's regional executive 
for the Rocky Mountain region. "Colorado is actively pursing legislation and 
administrative changes relative to some portions of its exotic statutes." 
</P>
<P>
He said New Mexico has problems with exotics, some introduced by wildlife 
managers themselves, that are forcing native wildlife out of its habitat. 
</P>
<P>
In both states there is evidence of exotic species crossbreeding with the 
native wildlife, Dougherty said, and there is some indication that exotics 
might have spread disease in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"There are examples in every state that, no matter what means are used to 
contain them, the exotics always escape," Dougherty said. "When they hybridize 
with native species, the breakdown in the genetic integrity of both species 
causes them to become terribly vulnerable to disease." 
</P>
<P>
Rick Kahn, a wildlife biologist for the Colorado Division of Wildlife, said 
about 30 escaped mouflon sheep are crossbreeding with bighorn sheep in the 
Gunnison area, some 75 Barbary sheep are loose near Grand Junction and as many 
as 100 ibex, Barbary sheep and red deer have escaped from the William Cox ranch 
along the Colorado-Wyoming border. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced we have more (escaped exotics) than reported," Kahn said. "There 
are problems all over and I think exotic species are going to be a big topic 
for wildlife managers for years to come." 
</P>
<P>
Tory Taylor, president of the Wyoming Wildlife Federation, said he is concerned 
about exotics breeding not only with native wild animals but also domesticated 
farm animals. 
</P>
<P>
Although Dorrance has the resources to provide the best fencing available, 
Taylor said that's not enough because human error, vandalism, floods, drifting 
snow or fires all could lead to escapes. 
</P>
<P>
The Game and Fish Department estimates Wyoming's wildlife brings the state 
about $200 million from hunting and fishing annually and Taylor said it is 
obvious people who only observe or photograph the animals also contribute 
millions to the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"With the exception of wolves, Wyoming has every species we ever had," Taylor 
said. "Some, like the grizzly, the black-footed ferret are very low, but we 
hope to get them back. To think we run the risk of jeopardizing 100 years of 
successful game management for the concept of game ranching is just 
ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Dorrance questions the threat of disease and escapes, saying the animals would 
be certified disease-free and it would not be in his interest to allow escapes 
of animals that cost as much as $1,800 each. 
</P>
<P>
"If I wanted to bring in a new strain of cattle from Europe, I wouldn't have 
this problem," he said. "You can go buy untested goats that carry the same 
diseases and release them in the state." 
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the domestic livestock raised in Wyoming and some species of 
game birds are not native to the state, but he acknowledged that they were 
widespread in the state before there was any organized wildlife management. 
</P>
<P>
Wyoming Agriculture Commissioner Don Rolston and Wyoming Wool Growers Assn. 
Director Carol Paseneaux share Dorrance's skepticism about the threat of 
disease or hybridization, but neither has taken a position on the proposal yet. 
</P>
<P>
"If there is something that can economically benefit the state, I think we 
should look at it," Rolston said. "Health has to be considered, but nobody has 
said yet what diseases these animals would bring in." 
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the department has quarantine and inspection programs in 
place to deal with the disease threat.

2 CLEARED OF CHARGES IN MOBIL BLAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Criminal charges have been dismissed against two defendants in a trial stemming 
from a 1988 explosion at Mobil Oil's Torrance refinery. 
</P>
<P>
The dismissal leaves only Cal Cat Chemical Co., a Benicia-based contract 
company, and company President Paul Taylor as defendants in the trial, which 
finished a second week of testimony Friday. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Municipal Court Judge Josh Fredericks granted a defense motion 
Thursday afternoon to dismiss criminal charges of failing to provide safety 
instructions to workers against on-site supervisor James Hernandez and Cal Cat 
Vice President Frank Straw. Attorneys for the two men said the state labor 
codes under which the misdemeanor charges were filed applied only to employers, 
not to supervising employees. 
</P>
<P>
The case centers on the July 15, 1988, explosion of a tank at the refinery as 
three Cal Cat employees attempted to treat sludge on the tank's bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Cat employee Winston Jones, 30, was standing on top of the tank when it 
exploded. He died instantly. One of his co-workers, David Moustafi, suffered 
burns over three-quarters of his body. Another co-worker, Jerry Lekberg, lost 
hearing completely in one ear and, according to his doctors, has experienced 
frequent flashbacks to that day. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors charged that Cal Cat's supervisors and executives did not tell the 
workers about the dangers of the chemicals they were using and allowed them to 
create an explosive mix inside the tank. 
</P>
<P>
The trial is being conducted at a Redondo Beach hotel because of a shortage of 
courtrooms in the South Bay. Testimony is scheduled to continue Monday.

'BATTLE CRY ECHOES IN CANYONS' AS ECOLOGISTS FIGHT DEVELOPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A great, green bravo to Tammerlin Drummond for a thorough article that revealed 
the extent to which Southern California canyons have become battlegrounds 
between environmentalists and developers ("Battle Cry Echoes in Canyons," June 
23). 
</P>
<P>
Shopping malls and tract house developments along with their freeways (and now 
proposed toll roads) have concrete-ized the flatlands and polluted our air and 
water. Now they are threatening the region's last pristine frontiers -- our wet 
and green canyons. 
</P>
<P>
While abundant in peace and tranquility, Orange County's legendary canyons -- 
Laguna, Modjeska, Trabuco and Silverado -- are also important sanctuaries for 
endangered plants and animals. Here, native ecological diversity still 
prevails. 
</P>
<P>
If we do not resolve these battles, large mammals such as mule deer, bobcat and 
mountain lion, as well as endangered plants such as the Dudleya stolonifera 
(which grows nowhere else in the world but Laguna Canyon) will be gone before 
this year's kindergartners graduate from high school. 
</P>
<P>
While it may be true that "until our pants are on fire, we never bother to pay 
attention to what's going on," many in the South County have been fighting for 
open-space preservation for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the case with respect to Laguna Canyon. In early 1988, the Laguna 
Canyon Conservancy was formed and swiftly became Orange County's most 
demonstrative environmental organization. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, it galvanized 8,000 protesters to walk in Laguna Canyon. It 
looks like that act pulled the landowner, the Irvine Co., away from the 
bulldozer's drive stick and sent him walking to the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
But the Canyon Conservancy followed a group known as the Laguna Greenbelt Inc., 
which, since 1968, has negotiated with the developer and helped others secure 
15,000 preserved acres of native plant and animal habitat in the Laguna 
Greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
The last piece of the greenbelt lies in Laguna Canyon, and that is the piece 
the Irvine Co. would like to develop. It's the piece that links major 
open-space acquisitions together, forming one viable and sustainable Southern 
California greenbelt. If it is lost, from an ecological standpoint, the 
wildlife many not survive. 
</P>
<P>
According to The Times, Irvine Co. Vice President Larry Thomas asks if current 
efforts to secure the disputed land by a contemplated bond initiative are 
realistic. "Is the property so important," he asks, "that people will pay for 
it?" 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Mr. Thomas, the environment is that important! But, let me ask the Irvine 
Co. this: With respect to what the property is worth, is $70 million your 
realistic asking price?

BALANCING THE 'FAST-FORWARD CHILD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm glad The Times is allowing mental health professionals to express 
themselves in Commentary. Amy Stark's piece ("Bringing Balance Into the Life of 
Your 'Fast-Forward' Child" June 24) describes a problem that drives many 
children over the edge and into drugs and premature death. 
</P>
<P>
Typical, however, of the traditional mental health community, Stark limits her 
scope to the personal and interpersonal aspects of this problem, touches only 
briefly on the social aspect and ignores altogether the socioeconomic and 
geopolitical aspects that create the "fast-forward" adult. 
</P>
<P>
Children learn from and are overpowered by the behavior of their parents and 
authorities. Stark asks us to make our children slow down and smell the roses, 
but she doesn't tell us that they can't unless we adults begin to do the same 
in our own lives. We may tell our children one thing, but our hypocritical 
behavior speaks so loudly our kids can't hear a word we say.

REGISTERING TO VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the Alpha Beta supermarket in Irvine on April 14, a hot, bright California 
day, a fraud was committed in the guise of civic service. Two young women armed 
with a load of forms were approaching people and asking if said people were 
registered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
If not, here was a simple, expedient voter registration process. 
</P>
<P>
How wonderful! How truly innovative and helpful! I was foolishly going to go to 
a town hall to register, but this was so convenient. 
</P>
<P>
So many things are run differently here than in Connecticut that I assumed and 
was assured by the young women that I was registering to vote. I was most eager 
to participate in the primary, so I listed my party preference. 
</P>
<P>
Then, to my chagrin, on June 5, another hot, bright California day and primary 
voting day, cheerfully I dressed to go exercise my rights as an American 
citizen. At the polling place, there was no record of my being a registered 
voter. 
</P>
<P>
I called the registrar of voters. "Why didn't you call when you did not receive 
your confirmation in the mail?" 
</P>
<P>
Why? Because in the 20 years I've been registering to vote in the other states 
I have lived in, I was registered at point of registration. There was no 
explanation by the young women at the time I filled out that form that I should 
receive mailed confirmation or call the registrar of voters. They, in fact, led 
me to believe this was a legitimate procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe they didn't like my party choice. Maybe it was "lost in the mail." Maybe 
it should be a felony for political parties to canvass for voter registration 
since they might be tempted to circular file some voters. Maybe this method of 
registering is not well-conceived.

A CIVIC IMMIGRATION SCAPEGOAT -- AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Isn't this beginning to sound familiar in Orange County? A city becomes 
frustrated when its municipal services become overburdened. Then it reaches the 
conclusion that illegal immigrants are becoming such a problem that it must 
deputize itself to assume the task of stemming the tide. 
</P>
<P>
It happened recently in Costa Mesa, where efforts by the City Council to enlist 
local charities in the cause of immigration control brought confusion and 
embarrassment to almost everyone from City Hall to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Santa Ana's own architects of foreign policy emerged with a report 
urging local police to "gain control over the expanding illegal immigrant 
population in the city" by working more closely with federal immigration 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
From its title, you might think that the Mayor's Task Force on Neighborhood 
Standards and Preservation, the group issuing the report, had as its goal the 
protection of some local architectural and civic landmarks. But the 16-member 
panel had a more jingoistic message for the City Council, to which it delivered 
its findings. There were, it said, five key issues for the 1990s: neighborhood 
overcrowding, the impact of the non-English-speaking immigrant population, 
crime and gang activity, traffic congestion and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The report essentially laid these problems at the doorstep of illegal 
immigration -- which in turn opened a hornet's nest of protest from the Latino 
community and civil rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
The report complained that schools are overcrowded and negatively affected by 
illegal immigration. Its solution was a knee-jerk reaction, just as Costa 
Mesa's was. It suggested that the Police Department increase cooperation with 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service to enforce existing laws, and to 
reduce the number of undocumented people settling in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
The director of a local Latino-rights group cut through the euphemisms to 
outline the report's true message: "Conduct raids to reduce the number of 
immigrants in Santa Ana." To his credit, Police Chief Paul M. Walters said that 
his department already cooperates with the INS in arrests of illegal immigrants 
who have committed crimes but that it will continue a policy of not cooperating 
with INS agents on periodic neighborhood sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
What's really wrong in the picture is that immigration problems have to be 
controlled at the border, and cities should not be in the business of playing 
U.S. immigration authorities.

EX-PARTNER OF 'BEST NARC': DON'T LET HIS SACRIFICE BE IN VAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE KLEIN, Joe Klein is a sergeant in the Fullerton Police Department and De 
La Rosa's former partner. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I want to be the best narc in Orange County," Fullerton Police Narcotic 
Detective Tommy De La Rosa said in April, 1986, when he joined the Orange 
County Narcotic Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
For the next four years, De La Rosa unleashed a relentless attack on the 
narcotics violator, utilizing his exceptional undercover skills to arrest more 
than 1,000 offenders, and to seize millions of dollars worth of narcotics and 
illegally obtained assets. 
</P>
<P>
De La Rosa always wanted to be a narcotic detective. In 1986, his career dream 
came true when he became a narcotics investigator. He brought to the unit a 
special magic that formed a bond between partners that could not be broken -- 
even by death. 
</P>
<P>
With De La Rosa's investigative talents, his obsession with being the best and 
his love for his partners, he helped transform the Fullerton Police Department 
Narcotic Bureau into a highly successful major unit. 
</P>
<P>
De La Rosa was highly recognized and respected for his undercover talents. He 
specialized in negotiating large cocaine transactions with Colombian, Cuban and 
Mexican traffickers. Law enforcement agencies from all over the region would 
rely on De La Rosa to do their undercover work. His motto was, "I buy drugs, 
that's what I do!" 
</P>
<P>
De La Rosa's expertise was recognized throughout the criminal justice system. 
He was awarded numerous commendations and citations from other law enforcement 
agencies, judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys alike. In 1989, he was 
further recognized for his service to the community by being selected as the 
"Outstanding Latino Peace Officer of the Year." 
</P>
<P>
De La Rosa was a courageous and ferocious soldier on the battlefield against 
drugs. He fought this battle right up to the last minute of his life. 
</P>
<P>
On June 21, he was fatally wounded during an undercover narcotic transaction in 
Downey. The transaction was to be the culmination of a two-week investigation 
into a major cocaine trafficking organization operating out of Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
In a "reverse sting" operation involving 30 officers from the Fullerton, 
Anaheim, La Habra, Brea and Cypress police departments, De La Rosa was supposed 
to deliver 200 kilos of cocaine in exchange for $4 million in cash. Instead, he 
was fired upon by five people who were lying in wait for him. 
</P>
<P>
Despite being shot five times, with two bullets fired at point-blank range 
hitting him in the back, De La Rosa returned fire, killing one assailant. 
Heroic medical efforts couldn't save De La Rosa. He was killed when a bullet 
entered the side of his chest and pierced his heart. 
</P>
<P>
De La Rosa made the supreme sacrifice in the war on drugs. He left behind a 
beautiful wife, three precious daughters, the youngest only 18 months old, and 
a group of partners who loved him as a brother. He was a hero and the bravest 
man that I have known. 
</P>
<P>
De La Rosa's death saddens me, but it also angers me. In this day of drug 
czars, the use of the military in interdiction efforts and the emphasis on 
large regional narcotic task forces, the role of the individual narcotic 
investigator is often minimized. While politicians are declaring war on drugs 
and law enforcement executives are posing in front of large drug and cash 
seizures, it is the nameless and faceless "narc," living his life on the 
street, who is marching into battle against insurmountable odds, fighting -- 
and dying -- for a cause he believes in. That cause is a drug-free society. 
</P>
<P>
De La Rosa's death angers me because of the complacency of the American public 
to take a stand against narcotics in the community. This is not just a problem 
that can be solved in Washington; it must be addressed in our own 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
If the American public has declared war on drugs, then why is marijuana one of 
the top cash crops of California, and the entire country for that matter? Why 
is Southern California the country's largest producer of methamphetamine? Why 
is it that you can walk into any neighborhood liquor store or convenience 
market and purchase narcotic use and sales paraphernalia right over the 
counter? 
</P>
<P>
De La Rosa's death angers me because the American public has allowed fanatic 
civil libertarians and greedy criminal defense attorneys to cloud the issues of 
innocence or guilt, to hold the rights of the criminal in higher regard than 
the rights of the victim or society as a whole, and to bring the wheels of the 
criminal justice system to a near halt. 
</P>
<P>
De La Rosa's death angers me because Americans are unwilling to take action to 
relieve overcrowded courts and jails that result in narcotic offenders being 
routinely released back into the community. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a long trail of human misery, violence and death, drug dealers are 
often given lenient sentences and early jail releases. In Orange County, the 
average sentence for multiple street-level sales of narcotics (heroin, cocaine 
and methamphetamine) to an undercover officer is 60 to 90 days in County Jail. 
But in actuality, a drug dealer sentenced to 90 days in jail will only serve 
about 48 days. One can only wonder where the war on drugs is being fought! 
</P>
<P>
De La Rosa's death angers me because Americans have stood by, heads buried in 
the sand, thinking the narcotic problem was not ours. It has been easy to point 
our finger at other countries. It has been easy to blame the problem on gangs. 
It has been easy to ignore individual responsibility. But the problem is ours 
and it impacts every individual and institution in the country. 
</P>
<P>
De La Rosa's death angers me because of the hypocrisy that exists in our 
society. If you are one of those who heard of De La Rosa's death, shook your 
head and said, "Gee, that's really too bad," then rolled a marijuana cigarette 
to help you relax, or did a line of coke or speed just to help you get through 
the day, consider yourself the cause of his death. 
</P>
<P>
While you sleep in comfort tonight, secure behind locked doors, please remember 
Tommy De La Rosa, and the thousands of dedicated peace officers across this 
country, who are out on the streets willing to die for you each and every day. 
When somebody kills a police officer, he kills a piece of America. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy De La Rosa, born May 12, 1947, died June 21, 1990; executed by drug 
dealers. God bless him. He was the best there is, the best there has ever been 
and the best there will ever be. May he be at peace.

GARDEN GROVE SMOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Boo-hiss to Garden Grove's City Council, specifically Mayor W. E. (Walt) 
Donovan and Councilmen Frank Kessler and Ray Littrell, for once again striking 
down the possibility of establishing lifesaving no-smoking ordinances in their 
city's restaurants, businesses and public places. 
</P>
<P>
Deserving applause are Vice Mayor J. Tilman Williams and Councilman Robert F. 
Dinsen for attempting, although in vain, to persuade the three dissenters. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, governmental intervention is not always a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
But when lives are involved and the Environmental Protection Agency reports 
that second-hand smoke is responsible for more than 3,000 cases of lung cancer 
among nonsmokers each year, not to mention approximately 25,000 cases of heart 
disease annually, wouldn't one conclude that it's time to step in and protect 
the innocent? 
</P>
<P>
Hats off to over half of the county's cities which have established no-smoking 
ordinances -- poor Garden Grove is still in smoke.

GOVERNMENT AID FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS OUGHT TO BE STOPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Housing and Urban Development Department Secretary Jack Kemp is wrong. There 
will not be wide support for easing immigration restrictions in California. 
</P>
<P>
Enough is enough, and we are overcrowded with hordes of illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
Why should we provide any aid to illegal immigrants? If they are illegal, they 
are not U.S. citizens, they do not belong here and our money should not be 
spent assisting them. 
</P>
<P>
It only sends a message for more to come. Since when is California designated 
as the safe haven for illegals? 
</P>
<P>
Of course the civil liberties groups, immigration rights organizations and 
religious groups call us racist for wanting to restrict them; it is their job 
and money in their pocket to protect them. 
</P>
<P>
This is America, this is our country and we are trying to protect it. I believe 
it is more of an overcrowding problem than a racist one. We are running out of 
space, water, clean air, roads, dump sites, etc. 
</P>
<P>
The people in Oregon and Washington do not want Californians moving to their 
states, and they come right out and tell us so. We are not wanted. Stay home, 
they say. Is this racist?

LOVING AND LOSING A CHILD OF ADOPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two days ago a family was told they must give up their 17-month-old son to his 
birth mother. As a prospective adoptive mom, I can't imagine the horror this 
child's adoptive parents are going through. 
</P>
<P>
I am outraged. 
</P>
<P>
This is an issue that pro-choice and pro-life forces can join together on. It 
is also an issue on which birth parents and adoptive parents can agree. It is a 
matter of being pro-family and pro-child. 
</P>
<P>
Families, like my husband and I, who tried for years to have a child are so 
eager to love and cherish our adopted children. They are no different to us 
than any biological child. They are our children. 
</P>
<P>
Why, after struggling for so many years and suffering disappointment after 
disappointment, must we be afraid that a birth mother can after six months' 
time (or in this instance 17 months) take our child away from us? 
</P>
<P>
Think of the impact on the child. He is being ripped away from his loving 
parents to go live with someone he doesn't even know. 
</P>
<P>
The biological process of conception is not what makes you a parent. It is the 
wonderful hours rocking the baby to sleep, playing with the baby, feeding the 
baby, staying awake at night when the child has a cold, seeing the first smile. 
</P>
<P>
This issue is not anti-birth parents. We want to tell our children that their 
birth parents loved them and made a very difficult but loving choice. Loving 
their children, they should want their child to have the best that life has to 
offer.

RISK OF A BLAZE GOES WITH THE TERRITORY; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: HILLSIDE HOMES ATTRACT BUYERS DESPITE THE VULNERABILITY TO FIRE. 
LAST WEEK'S DESTRUCTION IN GLENDALE IS UNLIKELY TO SETTLE CONTROVERSY OVER 
BUILDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was an especially busy week for bulldozers in Glendale. On one hillside, 
they could be seen scraping up the charred debris of 46 homes destroyed in an 
arson fire while, just over a ridge, other bulldozers leveled dirt for yet 
another hillside development. 
</P>
<P>
And so it goes in Glendale, a city of 153,000 that sits at the base of two 
ranges, the Verdugo Mountains and the San Rafael Hills. Many people see these 
hills as the last, best hope for a house with a view. Others see them as 
vulnerable targets of overdevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
Although the fire last Wednesday provided fodder for those in Glendale who 
would stop the march to build on its hills, it is not likely to settle a 
long-running but escalating controversy over development. 
</P>
<P>
"Fire is always a problem, but Glendale is land-locked," said Mayor Larry 
Zarian. "The only area we can grow into is the hills. I don't condone that. I 
don't like that. But that's the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, pressured by homeowners who don't want hillside homes looming 
over their hillside homes, or blocking their views, last February instituted a 
moratorium that limited to 100 the number of houses that could be approved for 
construction on Glendale hills over the next 18 months. Already approved 
developments were not affected. 
</P>
<P>
Fire hazard has not been a major rallying point in the fight to check a flurry 
of hillside development in Glendale during the past decade. It might now 
receive more prominence in the debate. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, two days after the big blaze, charred shards filled the lot where 
Youngsuk Jun's eastern Glendale house used to stand. Even the moist aloe plants 
that once divided his back yard from a steep, brushy slope were crisp black. 
</P>
<P>
And the hills behind his home, which were scorched bald by the wildfire, remain 
the tentative site for at least 40 new houses. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been living here seven years," Jun said. "Even though I knew this was a 
fire area, it never happened to me. So I thought I was safe." 
</P>
<P>
Houses perched on hills are especially susceptible to fire because heat rises 
naturally, baking the slope in front of the fire and causing flames to leap up 
the hill, said Fire Chief John Montenero. Drafts build in the canyons below, 
fanning those flames higher and hotter. It is generally believed by 
firefighters that blazes burn uphill 16 times faster than they do downhill. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like an explosion," Montenero said. "Add the wind and it's like a whoosh 
-- the house is just gone." 
</P>
<P>
Such scenarios of doom hardly intrude upon new home-buyers scouting the hills 
above Glendale. Instead, what they see are views of meandering canyons and of 
city skylines, a little breathing room in a metropolitan region that is 
increasingly congested. 
</P>
<P>
"It's lovely, it's quiet, it's like being up in the mountains," said Margaret 
Ross, whose home of 27 years lost most of its roof in the fire and will have to 
be demolished. "On a full-moon night you see the big moon come peeking out over 
that ridge." 
</P>
<P>
The market created by that enthusiasm for hilly terrain, joined with improved 
grading equipment and inflated housing costs, created a construction boom in 
Glendale's foothills in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
From the massive Rancho San Rafael subdivision east of the Glendale Freeway, 
where 400 homes have been built in the past year and 150 more are to be 
completed this year, to a 43-home project beginning near La Crescenta, just 
north of the city, hillsides are hot properties in and around Glendale. The 
name of the game is elevation, as the Rancho San Rafael neighborhoods names 
make clear: Monteverde ("green mountain"), Las Colinas ("the hills") and Vista 
Cielo ("heaven view"). 
</P>
<P>
Said Gary Emsiek, a vice president for Homes by Polygon, which developed Rancho 
San Rafael: "It's a real strange dichotomy -- everybody wants to live on view 
property, and view property only comes about when you build on a hillside." 
</P>
<P>
Development proposals being brought before the City Council later this year 
include 25 houses in Glenoaks Canyon and between 47 and 61 sought by Polygon 
for the land behind Youngsuk Jun's property. 
</P>
<P>
Large hunks of undeveloped hills surround the city of Glendale, and their 
future depends largely on politics and the housing market, development 
opponents say. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, development detractors have fought new construction largely on 
grounds other than fire. They recited the familiar litany of homeowner 
complaints, saying the subdivisions would ruin their views, drag down their 
property values, bring more traffic to their streets and crowd their children's 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes they sprinkled in concerns about drainage and mudslides on the 
denuded slopes. Fire hazards only arose obliquely, they said -- What would be 
done to prevent fires during construction? What kind of roofs would the houses 
have? Sometimes they even found themselves opposing extra fire-access roads 
requested by the city because they saw them as more scars in their hills. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the moratorium, the true impact of which is a matter of debate, 
anti-development successes have been few. 
</P>
<P>
"We fought the development in the hills for a long time," said John Zachman, 
spokesman for the defunct Verdugo Highlands Homeowners Assn., which initially 
objected to the Rancho San Rafael project. "But most of us became more 
reasonable. We understood that there was going to be development and finally 
reached an agreement with the developers." 
</P>
<P>
That agreement included preservation of more than 200 acres of open space, 
which Zachman thinks was a pretty fair deal. 
</P>
<P>
Another anti-development success came when a 104-unit apartment complex 
proposed for three acres in Verdugo Canyon, in 1985, was blocked by the City 
Council after vigorous outcry from neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Less successful was homeowner opposition to removal of a ridge in the Verdugo 
Mountains. In April, bulldozers began slicing 250,000 cubic yards of earth to 
fill in a pit inadvertently created during construction of the 197-lot Oakmont 
View subdivision, which afforded views of the the Oakmont Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Although last week's fire is certain to add one more issue to the debate, 
developers and city officials contend that fire-prevention measures required in 
new construction drastically lessen the chances of involvement in a blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Emsiek, at Polygon, observed that the fire nearly circled the Rancho San Rafael 
project, but never slipped through its Mediterranean gates. "If you look at it 
from the air, it looks like the hole in the middle of a doughnut," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Zachman agreed that restrictions placed on new development may hinder the 
spread of fire, but he said: "If you push that logic to the extreme, it says 
take down the whole mountain and put in houses. . . . If you cut down the 
mountain, you have the San Fernando Valley, right?" 
</P>
<P>
Instead of hampering new development, the fire most likely will propel 
movements toward tougher safety laws. In interviews, council members said they 
may take more drastic action against wood roofs -- perhaps even forcing 
existing roofs to be changed. Councilman Dick Jutras said he plans to propose 
requiring outdoor sprinkler systems for homes with large lots. 
</P>
<P>
Those proposals may meet with resistance from a minority of hillside 
homeowners, who prefer to ignore the perils of their location. One resident of 
Foxkirk Drive, whose house survived unscathed while six neighbors' burned, was 
insistent: "We've never considered this a vulnerable area," said Louis 
Morreale. "This is NOT a brush area." 
</P>
<P>
Those who were burned out seemed hardly ready to abandon their prized hillside 
lots. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday was the second time Margaret Ross has had to evacuate her Foxkirk 
Drive house because of fire. Yet she, like all of the other fire victims 
interviewed, said she will rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been since '64 that we had the other big one and I'm 74," she said. "So, 
if it gives us another 20 years, that'll be all right."

IT'S NO CONTEST: VISITORS JUMP AT FREE CHANCE TO PLAY ALONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

For 21 points, can you name the television game shows that are hidden in this 
article? 
</P>
<P>
Being an out-of-towner unschooled in Hollywood trivia, North Dakota tourist Rob 
Volden probably can't. But then he didn't count on becoming a game show 
contestant, either, when he stopped to look at stars' footprints embedded in 
those Hollywood squares at Mann's Chinese Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
That was before Mike Wood approached him and said, "Let's make a deal." 
</P>
<P>
"Free tickets to a Hollywood show!" Wood promised Volden and other visitors 
milling about the courtyard. Take a chance, climb on the free bus and get in on 
"a live television taping," he urged. 
</P>
<P>
Game shows are as old as television. But of the 450 or so shows that have hit 
the airwaves since 1945, only a few have been blockbusters. Many have trouble 
attracting a viewing audience, much less a studio audience. 
</P>
<P>
That's where Wood comes in. He helps recruit studio audiences for more than a 
dozen television shows being produced in Hollywood. To give the shows an 
all-American look, producers like to fill their studios with out-of-towners. 
And the catch phrase for most budget-conscious tourists is "free tickets." 
</P>
<P>
Wood's gambit worked the other day with Volden and 40 other tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Volden, 22, a recent college graduate who is looking for a job, is not one of 
those high rollers. So instead of buying a tour bus ticket to see the stars' 
homes in Beverly Hills as he had planned, he took one of Wood's. 
</P>
<P>
"The price is right," he joked after climbing aboard the studio bus for a short 
ride to CBS Television City. 
</P>
<P>
At the studio, the visitors were met by veteran television producer-director 
Marty Pasetta. He explained they would have the chance of a lifetime to help 
test a new quiz show called "Everybody's Equal" that CBS has imported from 
England and plans to broadcast this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The game uses computerized answer buttons that are wired to every seat in the 
studio. That makes everyone in the place a player -- unlike other game shows 
that carefully prescreen contestants, Pasetta said. Everyone in the audience 
would have a chance to strike it rich by winning the top $10,000 game prize, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The button pushing began once all audience members' names were entered into the 
computer. At first, all they had to do was beat the clock by selecting the 
correct answer within 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, though, the computer began measuring audience members' response times to 
the split second as they answered such questions as, "What day of the week are 
American presidential elections held?" 
</P>
<P>
Veronica Lau, a tourist from Melbourne, Australia, immediately tumbled into 
that trivia trap. Saturdays, when voters are off work, make more sense than 
Tuesdays for elections, she decided. 
</P>
<P>
"This is fun," she said. But to tell the truth, "I wouldn't watch this show at 
home. I mostly watch documentaries." 
</P>
<P>
Louise Kilmurray of Bath, England, predicted CBS will hit the jackpot by 
picking up the British show. "I like it," she said. "Our shows are usually 
copied from America, not the other way around." 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Reynolds from Horseheads, N.Y., made a similar snap judgment. "I think 
it might be a hit," she said. "The show was fun. You don't get to do this on 
the East Coast." 
</P>
<P>
Visitor Aaron Medlock of Boston said free game show tickets let tourists have 
fun without putting their travel budget in jeopardy. "I'm finding out there are 
a lot of no-expense things to do in L.A.," he said. "This was complete fun." 
</P>
<P>
The producers of "Everybody's Equal" hope that network executives get the 
message. Nearly two-dozen stony faced officials in business suits filed into 
the studio during the show's test run and sat down in front of Volden to watch. 
</P>
<P>
But they never cheered or applauded. And they stood up as a group and marched 
silently out of the studio before the show ended. There was no give-and-take 
between them and the rest of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
It's anybody's guess what they thought about the show.

REFLECTIONS ON A THREE-'RING' CIRCUS; 
</P>
<P>
WAGNER'S EPIC CASTS ITS SPELL IN MANY GUISES, SOME OF THEM SERIOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hottest item around the War Memorial Opera House seemed to be a little 
button that proudly proclaimed the wearer's trendy malady: "RING FEVER." 
</P>
<P>
It was that time again. It was time for Wagnerian grandeur and Wagnerian 
pathos. It was time for Wagnerian delusion and Wagnerian sprawl. 
</P>
<P>
It also was time for a lot of long-delayed, ultimately uplifting Wagnerian 
climaxes. In some cases -- not all of them intentional -- it was time for a 
little Wagnerian silliness. 
</P>
<P>
After a five-year hiatus, the San Francisco Opera was reviving its properly 
gigantic, automatically controversial, somewhat battered and tattered, 
essentially conservative staging of "Der Ring des Nibelungen." The massive 
production -- a set of four interrelated super-operas that span a total of 17 
hours -- was to be staged four separate times between June 6 and today. 
</P>
<P>
The principals and conductor might change. No matter. The swollen, convoluted 
saga would cast its inevitable, uncanny spell, even for the odd, misplaced 
iconoclast. 
</P>
<P>
This, after all, was the ultimate Wagnerian experience: a durchkomponiert 
panorama involving feeble gods and fierce mortals, blustering giants and 
cringing dwarfs, singing dragons and hopping toads, specific magic and generic 
deceit, fatal greed and useless generosity, love and death, birth and rebirth, 
the whole damned thing. 
</P>
<P>
Thunderous ovations greeted the cadence as the curtain fell. Sometimes the 
ovations anticipated the cadence. Sooner or later -- preferably later -- Wagner 
always has his way. 
</P>
<P>
The hysterically devout would, in this instance, insist on spelling his with a 
capital H. Wagner attracts hordes of the hysterically devout. 
</P>
<P>
The local hordes were lucky this year. They didn't have to travel to Bayreuth, 
that mecca of German meccas, to witness the lingering revenge of Alberich, the 
pathetic baritonal gnome who forswears love (not to be confused with sex) in 
exchange for power. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Kupfer's unfortunate postmodern vision of the "Ring" was to be on view at 
the Bavarian shrine again this summer. American aficionados, however, could 
safely afford to stay home for once. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, they could stay home literally. Those in need of a "Ring" fix didn't 
even have to venture a pilgrimage to the 3,200-seat, quake-scarred opera house 
in Northern California's Bagdad by the Bay. Relatively lazy Wagnerites could 
experience an even more conventional version of their favorite epic in their 
own living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Opera -- having enlisted aid from recording and video 
companies, not to mention some private philanthropies -- had taped its 
emphatically reactionary production of the "Ring." It was presented by PBS on 
four consecutive, patently uncomfortable nights starting June 18. 
</P>

In San Francisco, it was possible -- confusing but possible -- for the 
blissfully afflicted to grab a waiting cab at the opera house as the rainbow 
bridge materialized at the close of "Das Rheingold." Ed Smiddy, that kindly, 
impeccably tuxedoed veteran of many "Rings" and other in-house wars, always 
stood guard at the exit, ready to aid patrons with tricky transportation 
maneuvers. If the responding taxi driver, often a Valhalla habitue himself, 
sped hotelward with cooperative dispatch, the insatiable traveler could still 
catch two hours of "Siegfried" on the tube. 
</P>
<P>
Overlapping performances should be enough to make even the most feverish of 
aficionados delirious. Still, some addicts cannot get enough of a habit-forming 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
Many patrons stayed around the War Memorial for weeks. They needed more than 
one four-part dose of Wagnerian exultation. Even with the top ticket costing as 
much as $500 per cycle, curiosity regarding repetitions proved vastly 
compelling. 
</P>
<P>
Insatiable Ringers simply had to be able to compare Gwyneth Jones' formidable 
though unsteady Brunnhilde (Cycles I and III) with Janis Martin's lyrical and 
poignant Brunnhilde (Cycle II) with Hildegard Behrens' intimate yet intense 
Brunnhilde (Cycle IV plus the Met telecast). Here was an embarrassment of 
heavyweight-soprano riches. 
</P>
<P>
The incorrigible habitues had to know whether Robert Hale, the taut and 
incisive Wotan of Cycle II, could compare with James Morris, the otherwise 
ubiquitous, possibly overpraised, chief of the gods. 
</P>
<P>
The insiders had to be able to discuss the relative merits of two conductors: 
Peter Schneider, the Austrian routinier who chugged rather hastily through the 
first two cycles, and Donald Runnicles, the Scottish newcomer who controlled 
both poetry and prose so memorably in the last two. 
</P>
<P>
This usually happy, increasingly weary observer sampled three "Rings" in June 
-- two in San Francisco and one on television -- plus numerous fringe events. A 
lot of Wagner, it was confirmed, goes a long way. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest problem at the opera house involved the man who wasn't there: 
Nikolaus 
</P>
<P>
Lehnhoff. The German director, who had staged the original production here in 
1985, found himself embroiled in a managerial disagreement with Lotfi Mansouri, 
the new general director of the company. Lehnhoff withdrew in a well-publicized 
huff, leaving his partly naturalistic, partly symbolic, partly stylized, often 
muddled theatrical concept in the well-meaning hands of junior assistants. 
Dramatic definition suffered accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
Musical matters remained uninspired under the generally competent, often hasty 
Schneider. Some orchestral sloppiness notwithstanding, the score sounded 
broader and more imaginative under Runnicles, who was conducting the full cycle 
for the first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
The casts fluctuated in quality, as all "Ring" casts must these days. Still, 
one could find much to admire: the sympathetic young Alberich of Tom Fox, the 
formidable old Alberich of Franz Mazura, the dramatically potent if strained 
Fricka of Helga Dernesch, the forceful if bland Siegmund of Gary Lakes, the 
sturdy Hunding of John Macurdy. 
</P>
<P>
One also could find contributions to regret: the vocally frayed Siegfried of 
Rene Kollo, the pallid Mime of Helmut Pampuch, the light-voiced Erda of 
Brigitta Svenden, the shrill Sieglinde of Rebecca Blankenship, the artificially 
darkened Hagen of Eric Halfvarson, the nicely acted, badly sung, oddly 
incestuous Gibichungs of Kathryn Day (formerly Bouleyn) and Michael Devlin. 
</P>
<P>
James Morris' top-heavy, bel-canto Wotan created the customary popular 
sensation. Unfortunately, dramatic impact concerned him only superficially. 
</P>
<P>
Hale managed to delineate the rage, the agony and the pathos of the tragic 
character more compellingly, despite less generous resources. Instead of 
concentrating on pearly tone for its own sensuous sake, he paid careful 
attention to the text and to the inherent dramatic conflicts. He has come a 
long way since his days as all-purpose basso with the New York City and San 
Diego Operas. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco offered its "Ring" patrons some intriguing bonus benefits. Also 
some that were not so intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
Academia got into the act. Distinguished scholars presented papers on the 
psychological problems of the work, the medical problems of its protagonists, 
the musical problems of its interpreters and the ethical problems of its 
creator. The Wagnerian calendar was crowded with panel discussions, exhibits, 
films, lectures, symposia, orgies of critical debate. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Plaut, M.D., talked about "Dwarfs, Giants, Dragons and Other Body 
Distortions." Gunter B. Risse, M.D., Ph.D., held forth on "Health, Race and 
Medicine: Wagner's Germany, 1850-1890." F. C. Redlich, M.D., discussed 
"Wagner's Impact on Adolf Hitler." Sherwin Sloan of the department of 
ophthalmology at UCLA explored one of Wotan's essential problems: "Seeing With 
Only One Eye." Hans Hotter, the definitive Wotan of his time, taught master 
classes. And so it went. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone took everything very seriously. The gospel according to Richard 
demands that. Well, almost everyone took everything very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Pippin's Pocket Opera company came up with a shoestring version of 
Wagner's all-but-forgotten semi-Shakespearean comedy "Das Liebesverbot," known 
here as "No Love Allowed." A group called Opera Bouffes mustered an 
off-off-off-Broadway revue called "The Merry Nibelungs." This series of 
parodistic skits and soggy in-jokes recalled nothing so much as the annual 
performance of the tipsy uncle who puts a lampshade on his head after 
Thanksgiving dinner, climbs atop the living-room sofa and regails the assembled 
relatives with unfunny stories. 
</P>
<P>
At Stern Grove, a wooded, sunny mirage on the outskirts of the city, Gwyneth 
Jones and some young members of the San Francisco Opera serenaded ecstatic 
picnickers with a free Wagner concert. The high-fidelity intentions were 
compromised, alas, by low-fidelity amplification. 
</P>
<P>
No one really understands the "Ring." Even with subtitles, the plot 
contradictions and convolutions cause dismay. 
</P>
<P>
This year, however, one could find a new crutch on the market, and it literally 
provided comic relief. DC Comics published its own pop version of the "Ring," 
recounting the story in precise, literal terms and splashing idealized 
illustrations across textually ballooned panels ($4.95 per opera). The inspired 
artist at work here was Gil Kane, the genius who gave us "Spider-Man." The deft 
writer was none other than Roy Thomas, author of "Conan the Barbarian." 
</P>
<P>
The language for these brightly colored comics turned out to be more archaic -- 
more Wagnerian, if you will -- than what one could read either on the PBS 
screen or above the San Francisco proscenium. 
</P>
<P>
"Look you, Mime," cries the muscular, loin-clothed Nature Boy as he splits the 
anvil. "Thus sunders 'Needful,' the sword of Siegfried." 
</P>
<P>
"Splanng," adds the dutiful weapon. 
</P>
<P>
A message printed on the glossy cover of each comic-book volume warns the 
reader that this "Ring" is "suggested for mature readers." The ploy prepares 
would-be voyeurs, no doubt, for the shock of some bare-breasted Rhinemaidens, 
not to mention a reasonably steamy love scene that unites the liberated Volsung 
twins. 
</P>
<P>
The comic-book "Ring" glorifies tacky kitsch, without shame and without 
apology. The Met production tries to validate, even to ennoble, the same vague 
vulgarities. Unfortunately, camp is less engaging when it emanates from high 
places. 
</P>
<P>
PBS has preserved for a dubiously grateful posterity the literal, let's 
pretend, cheap-postcard "Ring" staged at Lincoln Center by Otto Schenk, and 
designed by Gunther Schneider-Siemssen and Rolf Langenfass. The initial 
domestic telecasts here are to be followed by telecasts in at least 10 other 
countries. Integral CDs, laser discs and videotapes will not linger far behind. 
</P>
<P>
The Met officially estimates the potential viewing audience as "over 
100,000,000." The filming budget reportedly reached $1,250,000 per opera. It 
gives one pause. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, the rest of the world has been trying to re-create Wagner's 
tetralogy with some smattering of modern stagecraft, to imbue it with vital 
sociopolitical meaning for contemporary audiences. Meanwhile, the Met harks 
back to the naive ways of provincial German houses before World War II. It 
would be funny, if it weren't so sad, so myopic and so wasteful. 
</P>
<P>
Still, not all is lost. James Levine conducts with grandeur only occasionally 
compromised by stodginess. The mighty Met orchestra plays like an ensemble of 
bona-fide virtuosos. The cast includes such Wagnerian stalwarts as Behrens, 
Siegfried Jerusalem (performing Siegfried with masterly fervor despite 
indisposition), Lakes, Morris, Kurt Moll, the all-too matronly Jessye Norman, 
the impressively towering Matti Salminen and the wise if somewhat passe Christa 
Ludwig. These performances sound better than they look. 
</P>
<P>
The televisionary values are further compromised by close-ups that stress 
theatrical fakery and by cameras that often manage to look the other way during 
the most crucial bits of action. Illusion, in any case, is a sometime thing. 
Fafner, the loathsome dragon, resembles nothing so much as a growling crab 
cake. 
</P>
<P>
When PBS recorded Patrice Chereau's revolutionary and in many ways definitive 
Bayreuth "Ring" a decade ago, the telecasts were separated by weeks. This time, 
PBS made a lot of PR noise about the unprecedented plan to show the Met version 
on consecutive nights. This advantage was mitigated, however, by ridiculously 
late starting times -- in most markets -- and by the absence of life-sustaining 
intermissions. 
</P>
<P>
Compressing the most music into the shortest possible time frame also 
necessitated the omission of any enlightening narrative beyond F. Murray 
Abraham's minimal introductions. At least the erstwhile Salieri managed to 
pronounce the German words and names elegantly. 
</P>
<P>
The Met telecasts ended with the obligatory bravos and curtain calls, not all 
of them 100% authentic. Hildegard Behrens happened to sustain a minor injury 
when struck by a falling piece of scenery at the end of the final finale. The 
accident occurred off camera, after the soprano had finished the Immolation 
Scene. She was rushed to the hospital while the orchestra heralded benediction 
and redemption through love. 
</P>
<P>
No one took any post-performance bows that night. Undaunted, the PBS editors 
spliced in curtain-call footage from a previous performance. 
</P>
<P>
During Behrens' last televised bow, incidentally, an intriguing credit crawled 
down the screen. Following the obscure names of make-up artists, stage hands, 
lighting technicians, sound engineers, office assistants and caterers, PBS 
dutifully flashed the name of the Met's costume-shop head. 
</P>
<P>
That unsung artisan turned out to one Richard Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Wagner? Richard Wagner! 
</P>
<P>
Gotterdammerung, indeed.

<TEXT>
<P>
The morning after last month's Tony ceremonies, the artistic director of the 
Seattle Repertory Theatre headed home from New York with a Tony award for 
Outstanding Regional Theatre. But that wasn't all Daniel Sullivan brought back 
to Seattle. He also brought a couple of well-known Seattle Rep fans with him. 
</P>
<P>
Playwrights Wendy Wasserstein and Herb Gardner -- whose Tony-winning plays "The 
Heidi Chronicles" and "I'm Not Rappaport," respectively, started at the Rep -- 
were delighted to be enlisted by Sullivan. Both were perfectly willing to fly 
to Seattle, help Sullivan persuade his board to add another theater -- a 
smaller, versatile hall of about 280 seats -- and catch a plane home the next 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"Every playwright and director I know wants to come here to work," Wasserstein 
told the Rep's annual meeting. "The best time I ever had in the theater was at 
Seattle Rep," echoed Gardner. "Imagine thinking of the Tony not as completion 
but as a starting gun for this second theater." 
</P>
<P>
Why not? That's how people here think. "It's a frontier town," explains 
Sullivan. "There's an optimism about possibilities. We don't feel we're 
formed." 
</P>
<P>
All you have to do is look around. 
</P>
<P>
A few blocks from the waterfront, Robert Venturi's new $60-million home for the 
Seattle Art Museum is heading toward a 1991 completion. Security Pacific Corp. 
will open a 5,800-square-foot art gallery down the street later this year, 
while A Contemporary Theatre, one of the city's oldest theaters, is raising 
funds for its $10-million home nearby. The Pacific Northwest Ballet is adding 
new rehearsal and classroom space, and a blue-ribbon task force just concluded 
that the Seattle Symphony needs a new concert hall. 
</P>
<P>
And that's just expansion upon Seattle's existing cultural base. 
</P>
<P>
With the Goodwill Arts Festival set to start here Monday, thousands of visitors 
will soon learn what people here already know: Seattle has become one of the 
hottest arts centers in the country. The Emerald City isn't just bringing in 
terrific international fare for a few weeks. It is emerging as a year-round 
model arts community. 
</P>
<P>
Start with Seattle's gorgeous setting amid lakes and mountains. Add in two 
awards as the nation's most livable city, and new investments and attention 
from Pacific Rim nations. It was only a matter of time until a well-educated, 
sophisticated influx of new residents both prodded and profited from the city's 
long-term commitment to the arts. 
</P>
<P>
Art collectors Vivien and Richard Weisman moved here in February, invited 10 
people for dinner and spent the next two weeks honoring invitations to cultural 
activities from every person at the table. John Getzelman says that immediately 
after his arrival here as Security Pacific Northwest chairman, "chairmen of 
competitor banks and other senior business people came to see me personally to 
get me involved in the arts." After less than two years, Getzelman is on the 
symphony's executive committee, and his wife, Rita, is on the opera board. 
</P>
<P>
This is a city that makes arts a priority. Low-income housing and the Seattle 
Art Museum expansion were on the same 1986 ballot, and both passed. Murals, 
sculptures and other artworks grace police precincts, electrical substations, 
even manhole covers. And in a recent issue of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer's 
weekly entertainment guide, there were 28 auditions listed for everything from 
actors and choral singers to classical guitarists. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more season ticket holders to theater here than to the Seahawks," 
says Paul Schell, port commissioner, attorney and Goodwill Arts Festival 
co-chair. In the 25 years that he's been here, says Schell, "Seattle's become a 
city as opposed to a big town. It can hold its head up with some of the finest 
cities in the world. We're not the biggest, but we're certainly interesting. I 
think we marched to a little different drummer than the rest of the country 
because we've been isolated so long." 
</P>
<P>
They sure aren't isolated anymore. While the numbers of Southern Californians 
headed here may be exaggerated -- and Schell says the net gain here is very 
small once you subtract all the Seattlites headed south -- the area's lure is 
clearly apparent. Former agent and film executive Mary Alice Kier, who is now 
selling real estate here, says she is actively looking for homes for five 
Hollywood colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I lived the fast-lane life of a development executive in Hollywood," says 
Kier, starting her second screenplay since moving to a Seattle-area suburb last 
fall. "I ate out every night in wonderful restaurants and went to terrific 
parties. I was going to art galleries and plays, but I was just speeding 
through. I think the galleries and theater here are top-rate, and real basic 
people, not just Hollywood types, support them." 
</P>
<P>
Watch theaters fill here, suggests Peter Donnelly, director of the city's 
Corporate Council for the Arts. "You see people in black tie, but you also see 
people putting backpacks under their seats. The arts are what people in Seattle 
do. . . . The climate is cool and overcast, and people like to go out. Sitting 
in a concert hall or theater is like sitting around a campfire and telling 
stories." 
</P>
<P>
Most people trace Seattle's arts boom back to the 1962 World's Fair. Not only 
did the fair give people here a stronger sense of the world beyond, but it left 
behind an auditorium that became the opera house and a theater that first 
housed the Seattle Repertory Theatre. The public was so ready that when Seattle 
Rep opened in the fall of 
</P>
<P>
1963, about 9,000 season tickets were sold to performances by a theater company 
that had not yet presented a play. 
</P>
<P>
For decades now, the city's arts administrators have worked together to develop 
audiences and funding. "In the early days, we felt if we didn't hang together, 
we'd hang alone," says Donnelly, who landed here in 1964 as a Ford Foundation 
management intern, then helped lead Seattle Rep for 20 years. The city's arts 
leaders started meeting every Friday back in the '70s to share information, and 
a dozen of them -- running everything from the opera to the children's theater 
-- are still meeting regularly. 
</P>
<P>
People here believe in cooperation -- the words consensus and process punctuate 
nearly every conversation. In the early '70s, they worked together to push 
through a government-sponsored program allocating funds for public art that 
continues to be a model for cities and states around the country and even to 
help defeat a recall of pro-arts Mayor Wes Uhlman. More recently, arts people 
worked with other community activists to save the Pike Place Market near the 
waterfront, to keep billboards off the intrastate and to hold down the heights 
of downtown buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more (private) art collections between 59th and 72nd on Park Avenue 
than in all the Northwest," says Patterson Sims, Seattle Art Museum associate 
director and curator of modern art, who arrived here in late 1987 from New 
York's Whitney Museum of American Art. "But these (in Seattle) are collectors 
who feel very commited to this part of the country. They realize that the 
impact their holdings can have within public institutions is absolutely 
enormous." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the major patrons 25 years ago are still the arts' biggest backers 
today. But cultural founding father Bagley Wright, whose name graces the 
Seattle Rep's current home, says the newest financial players here are 
corporations. Even at the Center on Contemporary Art, a downtown avant-garde 
institution, executive director Katherine Marczuk reports that corporate 
contributions quadrupled last year and have doubled again this year. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone points to a strong, well-educated middle class, which provides 
patronage as well as audiences. The Seattle Opera had 5,000 donors last year, 
but only 615 of them gave 
</P>
<P>
more than $250. And for the 1,800 donors to the state's Artist Trust, an 
organization that gives away fellowships to artists, most gifts are in the 
$25-to-$35 range. 
</P>
<P>
The "typical" Seattlite, Donnelly says, "goes to Monday night symphony, stays 
home Tuesday, goes to theater on Wednesday and a restaurant on Thursday. On 
Friday, there's dance or opera and Saturday, the Pike Place Market. Sunday they 
sail or ski, and on Monday they start all over again." 
</P>
<P>
The rain doesn't hurt, of course. It stays light here until after 9 p.m. these 
days, and sunshine can apparently affect theater attendance. "We've had Sundays 
where it's cloudy in the morning, and the phone keeps ringing with people 
making reservations for that night," says Mark Murphy, program director of On 
the Boards performance space. "But if the sun comes out at 2 p.m., those same 
people call back around 5 p.m. canceling their reservations." 
</P>
<P>
It's obviously more than the weather, however. Seattle Arts and Lectures, which 
presents talks and interviews with authors, opened here two years ago and sold 
out 82% of its 1,200 seats its very first season. 
</P>
<P>
"There must be 300 software companies over in Bellevue," says Norman Langill, 
executive producer of the Goodwill Arts Festival, "and that's a lot of brain 
power. After 20 years here, I also think people just expect creative things to 
come out of the Northwest." 
</P>
<P>
These people are insatiable. Half the seats for an eight-hour seminar scheduled 
this weekend for the Seattle Opera's new production of "War and Peace" were 
gone by early June -- at $20 apiece. Donnelly says when he was in the dentist's 
chair recently, his dentist critiqued plays at the six theaters where he was a 
subscriber. "When I asked how come he didn't have subscriptions to (the other 
two major theaters)," Donnelly says with a laugh, "he said he had to leave time 
for music." 
</P>
<P>
As might be expected, audiences and patrons like that are very attractive to 
artists, writers, dancers and others. This is, after all, the region that 
spawned dancers Robert Joffrey and Mark Morris, artists Mark Tobey and Morris 
Graves. 
</P>
<P>
At Artist Trust, which has been handing out money to individual artists here 
since 1986, executive director David Mendoza says the greater Seattle area has 
the seventh-largest concentration of artists in a major metropolitan area, and 
the state of Washington has the 12th-largest concentration. 
</P>
<P>
While the picturesque Puget Sound area has always been attractive to visual 
artists, Mendoza says the region's pioneer public arts programs also "send a 
message that there is interest and support for artists in this part of the 
country." Seattle's Art in Public Places program manager Diane Shamash reports 
2,000 annual requests for information, and she shepherds tours for 50 groups of 
visitors each year (including, in May, a group from the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art). 
</P>
<P>
Consider the fate of a prominent Henry Moore sculpture here. A few years ago, 
new owners of a downtown office building sold the Moore sculpture out front to 
a collector in Japan. Word got out, and hundreds of people called both the 
Seattle Arts Commission and the mayor's office to lobby against the private 
sale. There was so much pressure on the U.S. companies involved that that they 
bought back the sculpture for considerably more than they sold it for. 
</P>
<P>
While housing has started to become more expensive here as elsewhere, the area 
is still economically hospitable to artists. "It isn't a center like Los 
Angeles or New York, but the life style and beauty are the trade-off," says 
Seattle-based ceramic artist and teacher Patti Warashina, a well-known sculptor 
who has shown work in Europe and Japan. "You can have a house and a yard and 
you don't have to be rich." 
</P>
<P>
Actors reflect similar sentiments. Glenn Mazen, featured in Kevin Kling's play 
"Lloyd's Prayer," closing today at A Contemporary Theatre, says that over the 
past 23 years he has raised five children here. "I couldn't raise a family and 
live and work in New York," says Mazen. "I have to supplement my income with 
commercials, voice-overs and film work, but we have a very good market here and 
it's beginning to expand." 
</P>
<P>
Episodes of ABC's "Twin Peaks" were shot in Snoqualmie, about half an hour out 
of town, and "The Fabulous Baker Boys" made the most of downtown Seattle as 
well as of Michele Pfeiffer. There are 322 Actor's Equity members here, and 
Sullivan says film and other work "is healthy -- it keeps them here." Adds 
Contemporary Theatre literary manager Steven Alter: "There's so much good 
talent here that actors think the street is paved with Equity contracts. I 
lived in Minneapolis, I lived in L.A., and it's happening here." 
</P>
<P>
Playwrights agree. Pulitzer Prize-winner Wasserstein came here, for instance, 
to nurture her play "The Heidi Chronicles" "in a safe environment for its 
beginning." And colleague Gardner says people coming to his play "I'm Not 
Rappaport" here "really looked like they wanted to be there. At the first two 
previews, I said, 'I remember these people. They're the people you write plays 
for.' " 
</P>
<P>
Funders ask how many theaters are enough, says Donnelly, "and I tell them it 
takes at least seven or eight theaters to keep (our professional actors) 
working. It takes the symphony, opera and ballet to keep 170 or 180 
professional musicians living here. And the benefit (of all that) just begins 
with their contributions to the symphony or theaters. They also live in 
neighborhoods and give music lessons, form chamber groups and otherwise 
influence people." 
</P>
<P>
Artists are good for Washington state, explains Artist Trust's Mendoza, who 
headed back home to Seattle after eight years in New York: "Their production 
doesn't pollute, and tourists seem to like them." 
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, recalls Seattle Symphony music director Gerard Schwarz, he 
and his counterparts at this city's other big cultural institutions were all 
participating in a panel discussion on the local arts scene. And one of the 
things they discovered is that every one of them had come from New York City. 
</P>
<P>
"We all came here for the cultural environment," says conductor Schwarz, 
formerly music director of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and still music 
director of the New York Chamber Symphony and Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart 
Festival. Acknowledging the incredible views of Puget Sound out his living room 
window, the maestro says, "We're all lucky to be in such a beautiful place. But 
quite frankly, I stay here because of the cultural environment." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's strong arts profile isn't entirely new, of course. The Seattle Opera, 
for instance, ranks as the nation's seventh-largest opera company and has long 
been well-known internationally as well as nationally. Its "Ring" cycle is 
reviewed regularly in London and Frankfurt, and the rest of its season has 
begun to get similar recognition. 
</P>
<P>
But snaring nationally recognized artists such as Schwarz can't hurt. Under 
Schwarz, for instance, the Seattle Symphony is turning out about 10 recordings 
a year, and in 1989 it received three Grammy nominations. 
</P>
<P>
The arrival of Seattle Art Museum curator Sims and big-league art collectors 
like the Weismans have also widened the sights here in the visual arts. While 
emphasis continues on regional art, and particularly glass art produced by 
students and teachers at the nearby Pilchuck Glass School, Seattle Art Museum 
President Virginia Wright expects more attention to international contemporary 
art once the new museum is complete. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders such as Schwarz or Sims also "provide a connection to a larger 
community," says veteran Seattle art dealer Linda Farris. "When you bring in 
world-class (leaders), it raises everybody's perceptions of an art form." 
</P>
<P>
Emigration isn't all at the top either. When On the Boards, a cutting-edge arts 
group, held its yearly artists meeting, half the artists, playwrights and 
choreographers in the room had been there less than six months. And at the 
similarly untraditional Center on Contemporary Art, 10 times as many artists 
came in looking for a place to show their work this past year as in the prior 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who moved here in the '60s would have been counterculture, and in 
the '70s and '80s, environmentalists and people wanting a more livable city," 
says Sims. "In the '90s, it's all that plus a thirst for a sophistication about 
culture." 
</P>
<P>
Already the newcomers are having an impact. Unlike many other cities, where 
half or more of an art dealer's sales may be to out-of-town collectors, Farris 
says that most galleries here make 80% of their sales to local or regional 
collectors. "While there are still just four or five major contemporary 
collections here, the big change is in the tier just below them, which was 
lacking before." 
</P>
<P>
The same is true at the opera. For the last "Ring" cycle, in '87, says Seattle 
Opera general director Speight Jenkins, 50% of the audience was from out of 
town. "But I expect that when we do it again in 1991, the audience will be 
60/40 from here because of all the new people. We are not now, nor will we ever 
be, the Seahawks, but if you bring in 100 newcomers, maybe 15 will have a 
passing interest in opera and five will be fanatics." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle is no New York or Los Angeles clone, however. Much patronage is done 
privately, and new residents point out the lack of "scene" restaurants, social 
coverage and indeed social-climbing. Sims says when he found out that Barney's 
in New York opened a store here, "I wondered where people would wear all those 
hyper-elegant clothes." And describing the hoped-for new concert hall, maestro 
Schwarz says quickly that "it won't be ostentatious. We want a beautiful hall 
that services the music brilliantly but we don't need a glitzy one." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will success spoil Seattle? 
</P>
<P>
The state's film and video office gets at least one call every single day from 
people across the country who are looking for jobs here, and increased 
Hollywood interest is expected to result in the opening of a city film office 
within a year or so. There is also discussion of a new performing arts center 
for the "East Side" -- the upscale communities of Bellevue, Kirkland and 
Redmond on the other side of Lake Washington -- as well as ongoing development 
of a theater district in nearby Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
Opera impresario Jenkins, for one, says three times in less than an hour that 
he readily welcomes new audiences and money from California and elsewhere. 
Opera board members even held a fund-raiser in February in Palm Springs where 
Jenkins spoke and gave 80 people a preview of "War and Peace," their big-budget 
entry in the Goodwill Arts Festival. 
</P>
<P>
But not everybody is pleased with all the change. Judy Malmgren, an 
epidemiologist who was born and raised here, questions whether A Contemporary 
Theatre's future downtown home amid skyscrapers could rival its current 
suburban setting where "in the summer you walk out to green trees and 
good-smelling warm air. They're going to a corporate setting and I don't like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
She also doesn't much like all the crowds at the monthly open houses at the art 
galleries. Looking around her at the people pouring into a Pioneer Square 
gallery on a recent Thursday evening, she complained that "it used to take me 
15 minutes to get here, but tonight it took 45 minutes to get here and find a 
parking place, and these people are all strangers. I liked it the way it was." 
</P>
<P>
At Seattle Rep, Sullivan says the Rep's success in sending plays to New York 
means he spends "a lot of time deflecting the interest of producers wanting to 
start plays here. Our workshops are also a little more tense -- now it's sort 
of make-or-break with playwrights and that's kind of a shame. " 
</P>
<P>
Some organizations have also expanded too fast. Pioneer Square Theatre went out 
of business last year not long after expanding from one to three theaters. 
Empty Space Theatre took over one of the Pioneer spots after being similarly 
undercapitalized and over-extended in its big, new home. And other mid-sized 
and smaller houses reportedly also sometimes encounter trouble meeting Equity 
payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
"We tend to do things a little slower," says Melissa Hines, managing director 
of the Empty Space. "We are being jostled by people with new money into 
accelerated growth and expansion that we would otherwise be more cautious about 
and scrutinize more." 
</P>
<P>
All the success is also putting incredible demands on existing institutions. At 
the opera house, for instance, conductor Schwarz says that despite subscriber 
preferences, there are not enough Saturday nights available for a subscription 
series. The orchestra can only do one of its rehearsals onstage rather than in 
a rehearsal hall, and it has to turn down major visiting orchestras because no 
opera house dates are available. 
</P>
<P>
Schwarz' new concert hall, budgeted at $54 million if built today, may profit 
from new monies offered by the National Arts Stabilization Fund. Seattle is one 
of five areas in which the nonprofit fund is operating a long-range financial 
program to stabilize 10 of the city's core arts organizations. The fund has 
already made million-dollar grants to the Pacific Northwest Ballet and Seattle 
Art Museum and will distribute $5.5 million more over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
While the 10 organizations that may qualify for the fund have budgets ranging 
from $634,000 at the Group Theatre to $8.7 million at the opera, most are 
fairly large organizations. Large organizations also get a big chunk of Seattle 
Arts Commission money, and here, as elsewhere, Seattle's large and small arts 
organizations don't always exist in perfect harmony. 
</P>
<P>
This is particularly true when funds are finite. Money may be coming in here 
from corporations and foundations, says Richard Andrews, director of the 
University of Washington's Henry Art Gallery, but the number of corporate 
headquarters and major foundations in Seattle is limited. "There's not an 
enormous well of money in Seattle that we can tap endlessly, and we have to 
confront that." 
</P>
<P>
One possibility, of course, is increased efforts to tap Pacific Rim 
corporations already fueling other segments of the Seattle economy. At the 
Seattle Art Museum, for instance, both president Wright and curator Sims say 
they plan to approach Japanese and Hong Kong collectors and others for support 
of their new Asian art museum. The museum's current home in Volunteer Park will 
be renovated as an Asian art center once the much-larger museum facility opens 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's favorable position in terms of Pacific Rim trading also counters the 
city's long-felt feelings of isolation. Arts people here readily acknowledge 
the problems of not being conveniently on the way to anywhere, nor in the 
artistic mainstream for artists needing to keep abreast of exhibitions or 
performances in their field. Although, says Andrews, "one of the strengths of 
the arts here has been that you're thrown on your own devices, and that 
challenge attracts a certain kind of person." 
</P>
<P>
Museum administrator Andrews, for instance, was raised in Los Angeles, later 
came here and ran the Seattle Arts Commission's public arts program, then left 
for Washington, D.C. to head the National Endowment for the Arts' visual arts 
program. But he came back again, he says, because "the assets in this community 
far outweigh the problems and challenges. I was offered a job I wanted in a 
city that is still in the process of defining itself, and where I could be part 
of a very active and progressive arts community. 
</P>
<P>
"The historic feeling here has been that a rising artistic tide will float all 
the ships," says Andrews. "In less than 30 years, we have developed the basic 
audience, the basic levels of support and the artistic staffs to achieve a high 
level of artistic quality. The Goodwill Arts Festival has us all stretching 
ourselves artistically, and our continued challenge is to sustain that stretch 
into the future."

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN NINE IMPORTANT AMERICAN SCREENWRITERS TRAVEL TO THE SOVIET 
UNION TO TALK SHOP WITH THEIR RUSSIAN COUNTERPARTS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
This spring, nine major American screenwriters converged in Amsterdam's 
Schiphol Airport, lugging cans of tuna, granola bars, coffee and other creature 
comforts of capitalism to buffer them against the bare-bones conditions that 
they had been warned about in the Soviet Union, where they were headed. Soon, 
they would add to their portable larders cartons of Marlboro cigarettes and 
packets of condoms, which tour leaders assured them would be useful for hailing 
down cabs and rewarding good service. 
</P>
<P>
The Americans were the visiting team on the first leg of an American-Soviet 
Screenwriters Festival set up by a pair of enterprising Americans to help boost 
the status of writers at home and to create a dialogue between writers from 
both countries in the era and spirit of glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
The group, selected from a list of 25 submitted by the Soviets, represented a 
broad cross-section in terms of age and genre. Each came bearing a film he or 
she had written. The writers: Julius Epstein, 80, "Casablanca"; Ernest Lehman, 
68, "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"; Frank Pierson, 65, "Dog Day Afternoon"; 
William Goldman, 58, "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"; Roger Simon, 46, 
"The Big Fix," adapted from his Moses Wine detective novel; Anna Hamilton 
Phelan, 46, "Mask"; Paul Schrader, 43, "Taxi Driver"; Lawrence Kasdan, 41, 
"Body Heat"; and John Patrick Shanley, 39, "Moonstruck." 
</P>
<P>
Next January, a contingent of Soviet writers will complete the program with a 
trip to the United States. That the program got off the ground at all is a 
testament to the perseverance of TV writer Linda Elstad who, after the Writers 
Guild of America had shot down the idea, enlisted the help of writer/producer 
Pamela Rosenberg. Together they secured financing from the U.S.-Soviet Film 
Initiative and the newly independent Soviet Screenwriters Guild and persuaded 
the WGA Foundation, an organization dedicated to promoting the image of the 
screenwriter, to give it a "go." 
</P>
<P>
The journey, a 17-day tour of Moscow, Leningrad and Tblisi (the capital of the 
Soviet republic of Georgia), shed light not only on the Soviet film scene, but 
on certain realities of Hollywood: the ongoing battle between art and commerce; 
the adversarial relationship between the writer and the rest of the Hollywood 
hierarchy; the impact of American films on the rest of the world. For a 
reporter, the trip also offered rare opportunity to observe a handful of 
top-notch American writers -- accustomed to solitude and affluence -- thrown 
together in an underdeveloped country for a relatively long stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Eye-opener No. 1: Glasnost, a seeming boon to the Soviet film industry, has 
created as many problems as it has solved. The new freedoms have proven 
problematic for Soviet filmmakers thrust into the commercial arena for the 
first time. "You've been spoiled since you never had to pass audience 
approval," Schrader told one Soviet colleague during a discussion at the 
Central Club of the People of the Arts. "Now you'll find out -- and it's a 
chilling realization -- that the audience can impose as much censorship as the 
government. I hope you'll try to give them what they need . . . not just what 
they want." 
</P>
<P>
Not likely. Art, in the minds of Soviet filmmakers these days, is evidently 
secondary to commerce. The thrust of the questions posed by the Soviets 
throughout the trip: the possibility of generating U.S.-Soviet co-productions 
to get a piece of the international pie (difficult, Roger Simon explained, 
because of the American aversion to subtitles and "all things foreign"); 
salaries paid for various kinds of work (as well as taxes paid on those sums); 
specifics of the Guild contract (a copy of which was left for them to peruse), 
and (1917 notwithstanding) how exactly one goes "on strike." 
</P>
<P>
"The writers were less interested in 'process' than in trading their lives for 
ours," noted Shanley. "Getting that house in Malibu, all that success in 
America brings. They want what we can't give them, which is not only 
frustrating but exhausting. The students were a different story, though. I saw 
young Raskolnikovs -- dark, dissatisfied, full of foreboding -- at every turn. 
Not one mention of money. When I lectured at NYU, all they cared about was the 
'back-end deal.' " 
</P>
<P>
A meeting with the newly elected minister of culture, a charismatic former 
actor, hit home the hard truth: Glasnost has left the Soviet feature-film scene 
at a virtual standstill. "We still have a slave mentality," he admitted. "It's 
like a hungry man coming to a table full of food and drink. We hardly know 
where to begin." Political upheaval further complicates the situation. 
"Meetings of the Supreme Soviet are much more gripping than a detective story," 
says Maria (Masha) Zvereva, a leading Moscow screenwriter and one of the 
primary organizers of the exchange. "Documentaries and television are much more 
interesting to the people. Glasnost has been a cold shower for a lot of us." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, but Soviet warmth radiated nonetheless. Moscow screenwriters, bucking 
food shortages themselves, pooled their money to buy produce for the 
"salad-loving Californians." (Three four-course meals a day kept the American 
stores of tuna cans and granola bars in the suitcases.) In Tblisi, where 
visitors are considered "gifts from God," American filmmakers were particularly 
welcomed. The Georgian national folk troupe was called back from vacation to 
perform for the group; local independence fighters postponed their disruption 
of the airwaves so a scheduled televised press conference with the writers 
could proceed. 
</P>
<P>
"American films provided the dreams on which these people lived for 
generations," said Elstad. "And these are the guys who wrote them. They don't 
want to hear about our problems. To the Georgians, we represent democracy, 
freedom." 
</P>
<P>
The films screened for the Soviets played to sell-out crowds, almost all of 
whom were seeing the movies for the first time. Watching the masses flock into 
"Casablanca" at Moscow's Oktober Theater, Ernest Lehman commented to the film's 
co-writer Julius Epstein, "Julie, Julie . . . your picture has legs." 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of subtitles or dubbing, a translator in the back row of the 
theater played each of the roles. "The theater had no air-conditioning and it 
must have been 95 degrees," recalls Anna Hamilton Phelan, who watched "Mask" 
being shown. "A woman, using a flashlight to scan the script, would imitate 
Cher, then Sam Elliott. The place was as quiet as a tomb. Bodies leaned toward 
the screen. It hit home the fact that, for an emotional experience in the 
theater, you don't need technology and special effects. All that's necessary is 
to pull that string of 'humanity.' " 
</P>
<P>
For the Americans, the emotional ice-breaker of the trip was triggered on the 
third day with a 65th-birthday party thrown for Frank Pierson at the Mali 
Theater Club. After several Soviet toasts were rendered, the Americans took the 
floor. Before the evening was over, they were quoting their favorite last lines 
from movies and singing film songs on the bus heading back to the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"There used to be a community of writers in Hollywood, writers' tables at every 
studio," said a nostalgic Pierson, later. "Now we all work at home and only get 
to meet each other in the caldron of immediate production. This evening we 
started talking about film writing as a career with value and meaning. It was a 
sense many of us had lost." 
</P>
<P>
Spirits flagged during the Leningrad leg. The cool, damp weather muted the 
beauty of the city and the moods of the Americans, many of whom had to load up 
on antibiotics to fight off sore throats. As food and tourism dominated the 
agenda, the writers talked of being "under-tapped and over-entertained," as 
Melville Shavelson, head of the WGA Foundation, put it. "I'm being used, but 
I'm not sure for what," said Lehman. "If this were a film, this would be called 
the 'soft underbelly' (Achilles heel)," Kasdan agreed. 
</P>
<P>
Tblisi revived them. Deep in the throes of independence fever, politics 
displaced movies as the topic of conversation. William Goldman was overwhelmed 
by the sound of a bullhorn at a demonstration outside the hall where "Butch 
Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" was being shown. "Before I came, I thought that 
going from Moscow to Tblisi would be like going from New York to L.A. Now I 
realize it's like going from France to Spain . . . different language, 
different alphabet. I think of myself as non-political, but this has been a 
radicalizing experience for me. It's so moving. All they want is to be left 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
Interaction with students at the Institute of Theater and Film proved equally 
enlightening. Goldman, assigned to an animation class ("a street cleaner knows 
more about the topic than I") marveled that no one had yet seen "Fantasia" and 
suggested that the next delegation come videocassettes in-hand. Kasdan gave an 
acting class an inspirational shot-in-the-arm. "If you're a doctor, you'll 
probably have a practice. If you're an actor, though, you may not have 
anything. People who give their lives to art are very brave. Everybody will be 
trying to push you off the road, encouraging you to do something 'reasonable.' 
Ignore their advice. You may grow old and never hit it. But only if you're on 
the road can you get lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Though participants said they found the trip personally rewarding, tallying up 
the impact proved difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"We came expecting our brains to be picked, but ended up more as goodwill 
ambassadors," said Lehman. 
</P>
<P>
Shanley was less pessimistic: "We were a repository of knowledge," he said. 
"The Soviets got from us a taste of what they didn't know . . . which turned 
out to be 'a lot.' I suspect the most important of the exchange is yet to come. 
When the Soviets come over to screen their films in January, it will be like 
excavating buried culture -- opening a sealed time capsule after so many years. 
The American public is totally ignorant of what they've done." 
</P>
<P>
The 17 days dragged on at times, but a sense of internal harmony prevailed. 
Pierson's theory: "Our bus consisted of the single smallest oppressed ethnic 
group. The thing that held us together was the sense that nobody understands us 
-- including our mothers. It was bizarre: no fights of any importance. My real 
family can't get through Thanksgiving without a fistfight in the yard. Those of 
us who are successful live like princes and princesses and tend to complain too 
much about the pea under the mattress. But that was all put aside in this 
case."

CULTURAL FESTIVAL SPRINGS FROM AN INTERNATIONAL SPORTS COMPETITION

When members of the Seattle Organizing Committee sat down to plan the 1990 
Goodwill Games here, they felt swimming, figure skating and gymnastics were 
just a start. They wanted Ted Turner's huge international sporting event to 
have a cultural side too. 
</P>
<P>
The result? The Goodwill Games themselves don't start until July 20, but 
beginning Monday is the Goodwill Arts Festival, four weeks of world-class 
productions and mini-festivals. Budgeted at $12.4 million, the festival 
includes performances by the Bolshoi Ballet and the Grand Kabuki Theatre, 
exhibitions of Soviet constructivist and conceptual art, Arab films and a 
National Gay and Lesbian Theatre Festival. 
</P>
<P>
"The arts are a strong component of everyday living in Seattle," explains 
Norman Langill, festival executive producer. "If you're planning a large-scale 
event here, sports or otherwise, it's very natural to include a cultural 
element. Nobody here said, 'Let's talk about it.' It was as normal as figuring 
out whether or not there was sufficient hotel space." 
</P>
<P>
Langill, who has been producing the huge, annual Bumbershoot arts festival at 
Seattle Center for years, apparently knew his audience. The Bolshoi and Kabuki 
sold out on mail order alone, says Langill, adding that Montreal's Cirque du 
Soleil reported "one of the hottest starts they've ever had on a first-time 
visit to any city." And when organizers added an extra performance of the 
Bolshoi a few weeks ago, all 3,000 tickets were sold in less than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
It's a massive undertaking. There are 33 programs on the official roster, 
involving at least 26 local arts organizations and more than 200 performances. 
Besides total attendance of about 500,000 people, festival organizers expect 
more than 1,300 artists from two dozen countries (although special attention is 
being given to the arts of the Soviet Union). Also planned is an exchange 
program that will involve 250 Soviet educators, scientists, lawyers and writers 
and an equal number of their American counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
Already open is "Moscow: Treasures &amp; Traditions," a sprawling exhibition of 
paintings, religious objects, costumes and other items spanning five centuries 
and generally not seen before in the United States, a show of modern Pacific 
Northwest art at the Seattle Art Museum, and Soviet conceptual art at the 
Tacoma Art Museum. Set to open this week is an exhibition of Soviet 
constructivism at the University of Washington's Henry Art Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
The Seattle Opera is presenting Prokofiev's "War and Peace" -- at $2 million 
the most expensive production in the opera's history -- with 200 Soviet and 
other artists. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle's Intiman Theatre Company is presenting "Into the Whirlwind," the 
Sovremennick Theatre of Moscow's new adaptation of Eugenia Ginzburg's 
long-suppressed memoir of life in a Stalinist prison camp. 
</P>
<P>
Things changed during the four-year course of festival planning. Consider, for 
instance, the Eastern Europe political climate then and now. "When we started 
this, the Department of Defense was appalled at the notion we'd be inviting all 
these people to Seattle," says attorney Paul Schell, festival co-chair and a 
member of the Seattle Organizing Committee. "We were still in the Cold War era, 
and for a long time, people organizing the Games had better access than the 
State Department did." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Northwest Ballet co-artistic director Francia Russell staged 
Balanchine's "Theme and Variations" for the Kirov two years ago, leading to a 
continuing relationship between the two organizations, and Schell says he hopes 
similar links will develop for Intiman and other groups after the festival. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a consistent feeling now of our destiny as an economic and cultural 
crossroads between Europe and Asia, " says Schell. "London is five minutes 
closer to us than Tokyo, and the vision of our being a crossroads city like 
Venice was in the Mediterranean era is increasingly shared by Seattle's 
economic and cultural communities. That's where we're going in the '90s, and 
the Goodwill Games and Arts Festival are our calling cards." 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket information at press time: The Bolshoi Ballet and Grand Kabuki are sold 
out, and seats are getting scarce for "War and Peace," "Into the Whirlwind" and 
Cirque du Soleil. Tickets are still available for all other events; contact 
Ticketmaster in Seattle at (206) 292-1990 or (206) 628-0888.

COVER STORY: SUMMER SOAP PLOTS HEAT UP FOR THE YOUNG AUDIENCE

Summertime, and the living is easy -- unless you happen to reside in Pine 
Valley, Port Charles or the other settings of the daytime soap operas. The 
weather isn't the only thing that heats up from mid-June to mid-September. So 
do the soaps' story lines, with sizzling romances and provocative issues. 
</P>
<P>
The soaps' summertime pace accelerates to counteract the season's real-life 
languor, when more viewers are apt to be on vacation or spending time outdoors. 
And the important influence on many of the shows' hot weather happenings is the 
influx of younger viewers -- teen-agers and college students -- for whom school 
vacation can mean more time in front of the TV. 
</P>
<P>
Consider, for instance, some 1989 figures provided for CBS' top-rated "The 
Young and the Restless." From Jan. 2 through May 28, viewers age 12 to 17 
numbered 260,000, but from May 29 through Sept. 3 the figure rose to 840,000 -- 
a whopping 223% increase. Women 18 and older -- the soaps' primary demographic 
target -- registered only a 2% increase. 
</P>
<P>
"It is to all of our best interests, in terms of ratings consistency, to appeal 
to young people during the summer, though never at the expense of the 
traditional audience," said Lucy Johnson, vice president of daytime programs 
for CBS Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"Soaps are such a flexible form, with lots of plots and characters at any given 
time, that you can bring to the forefront a plot that spotlights young 
characters and direct a story line to your added audience. And soaps as a form 
have a greater chance of hooking someone than do other daytime shows -- if you 
get someone intrigued, they will keep watching." 
</P>
<P>
Though it seems an obvious summer strategy, the practice of featuring younger 
characters alongside the older ones may have been stumbled upon inadvertently, 
according to Douglas Marland, head writer of CBS' "As the World Turns." He was 
responsible for the phenomenally popular early-1980s pairing of "General 
Hospital's" Luke and Laura when he was head writer for that ABC show. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a conscious decision (to bring in Luke during the summer); it 
happened because of the way the story was structured," he said. "But we had the 
young audience, and the ratings soared. Then everyone else said, 'That has to 
be the way to do it: do young stories in the summer.' " 
</P>
<P>
With romance as the soaps' bedrock, so to speak, it is no wonder that younger 
characters find new or existing relationships intensifying during the summer. 
"What you hope to inspire," Marland explained, "is a rooting section for the 
(couples) you want to see together, and people hissing and booing those who 
complicate that." 
</P>
<P>
On NBC's "Days of Our Lives," for example, Patch and Kayla will remarry this 
summer, and Roman and Isabella, who now face obstacles, will find the course of 
their true love running smoothly by summer's end. 
</P>
<P>
Summer is often the time when new characters are introduced, whether to provide 
romantic complications or figure in other steamy plots. On NBC's "Santa 
Barbara," senior executive producer John Conboy has introduced what he 
described as "three hot, attractive young characters," all around age 19. One 
mystery woman is even named "Flame." 
</P>
<P>
Or popular characters of the past may return, such as "Santa Barbara's" 
Lockridge family and Robert Barr -- in a dual role this summer as his twin 
brother Quinn -- and the two-years-absent heartthrob Holden Snyder on "As the 
World Turns." 
</P>
<P>
Some soap producers deliberately take advantage of their larger youthful 
audience to dramatize issues directly relating to that age group. "We are 
unquestionably aware of our young audience, and we want to do something that 
will have a positive impact on their lives," said William J. Bell Sr., 
co-creator with his wife, Lee Phillip Bell, and executive producer and head 
writer of "The Young and the Restless." He and his wife are also creators and 
executive producers of "The Bold and the Beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Last summer "Y and R" tackled the issue of date rape, which is still drawing 
viewer mail; other plots have dealt with teen-age drunken driving, runaways and 
baby selling. This summer's plan to spotlight sexual harassment on the job was 
jettisoned after Bell discovered that charges are usually difficult to prove, 
thereby creating a story line that would frustrate viewers. The show, instead, 
will deal with the environment, drugs and young people living together. 
</P>
<P>
On NBC's "Days of Our Lives," supervising executive producer Al Rabin recalls 
that three years ago he delayed a Jack-and-Jennifer story line on teen-age 
sexual responsibility until the summer, after learning from the Center for 
Population Options of the dire need to educate teens about birth control. 
</P>
<P>
"We had Jennifer's grandmother tell her, 'If you're going to do it, be 
protected,' and we did actual shots of her getting a diaphragm," he notes. As 
it turned out, the couple abstained from sex until late last month. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not all the soaps cater to their younger summertime audiences. 
Despite its title, ABC's "All My Children" shies away from the practice, 
according to Jozie Emmerich, senior vice president of daytime programs at the 
network. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been criticized by our viewers, gotten letters saying, 'We just don't 
want all these kids,' " she said. "We have a wide panorama of viewers, so we 
have something for everyone. We try to do something youth-oriented year-round." 
</P>
<P>
Still, as Douglas Marland of "As the World Turns" says, "We do have a strong 
young audience watching all year long, but I think they look to the summer 
months as 'their' months. They look to the soaps to feature more stories 
exclusively for them."

CONFESSIONS OF A PINE VALLEY GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lauren Lipton 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since I started watching "All My Children," I've begun to compare real 
life to life in mythical Pine Valley, U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
I knew it was hopeless when I began to subconsciously pattern my behavior after 
what I saw on screen from noon to 1 p.m. on ABC. For example, when Nina moved 
out of Pine Valley to "find herself," I moved into a new apartment. When Brooke 
and Adam called it quits, I broke up with the guy I'd been seeing. I've 
incorporated myself into the plot without realizing it -- and lately, I've felt 
trapped between the two worlds. I can't decide which one is better. 
</P>
<P>
Romantically, soap land wins hands down over the real world. In soap land, love 
is quite literally the stuff dreams are made of. Take Julie, for example, who 
used to have romantic fantasies that were anything but idle. For a while, she 
existed in a state of unrequited lust for Nico, a hot-blooded guy from the 
wrong side of the tracks. She spent the summer lapsing into daydream after 
daydream -- scenes that were always blurry around the edges and looked as if 
they had been shot through Kleenex. 
</P>
<P>
Julie's fantasies always had Nico leaping through the window, grabbing her and 
kissing her passionately. Afterward, she'd open her eyes and sigh. But here's 
the kicker: Who would inevitably be standing outside the window but Nico, in 
the flesh? 
</P>
<P>
That summer I tried it myself, and Tom Cruise never appeared at my bedroom 
window. 
</P>
<P>
In Pine Valley this kind of thing can go on because people are always just 
dropping by their friends' homes. It's as if nobody has a job. They don't 
bother using the phone, I guess, because the town is so small it takes only 
minutes to drive from one end to another (but did I mention that Pine Valley is 
large enough to support national magazines, a hospital, a university, a number 
of world-class restaurants and two of the richest men in the world?). It lets 
characters indulge in the kind of face-to-face interaction that makes for drama 
like this: 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy: "What kind of a game are you playing, Trevor?" 
</P>
<P>
 Trevor: "It's no game. I like the guy. We have a lot in common." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy: "That's what I'm afraid of." 
</P>
<P>
 Trevor: "He's a changed man." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy.: "But you're not. You're the same hustler you've always been." 
</P>
<P>
 In the real world, over the phone, it wouldn't be the same. 
</P>
<P>
Close on the heels of such interaction follows the consummate message of the 
soap world: "I'm here for you." If only people said this in real life. If only, 
whenever you had a crisis, your friends would pop by, take you to lunch at the 
Pine Valley Inn, listen while you rattled on about your troubles, and then 
utter those four little words. 
</P>
<P>
When Cindy found out she had AIDS, Angie was there for her. Cliff was there for 
Angie after her husband was killed. When Nina left Cliff, Travis was there for 
Nina. And when Travis nearly lost his entire fortune through mismanagement of 
his company, faked his own kidnaping and got dumped by his wife, the Martins 
said they were there for him -- and gave him a job as chief administrator at 
Pine Valley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The web of interpersonal relationships, the level of support in the soap world, 
is phenomenal. But then again, everyone in Pine Valley has slept with everyone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are some elements of real life in the soaps, though maybe to an 
extreme. For instance, only in Pine Valley would every woman in town get a 
drastically different hairstyle -- on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
Real life also shows up in the bloopers on the set, which the producers often 
don't bother to reshoot. Like when a scene opened with Barbara and Tom in bed 
with their hands hidden under the covers. "You need some help in there, honey?" 
Barbara cooed. It wasn't clear until some time later that by "in there," 
Barbara meant in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
I watch the soaps because these kind of moments make me take real life far less 
seriously. Sure, in Pine Valley you can replace someone in your life simply by 
hiring another actor to take his or her place. In Pine Valley, every Friday 
ends with a cliffhanger. And everybody always has the perfect clothes and 
makeup -- even when they wake up. 
</P>
<P>
Then again, real life never looks fuzzy around the edges, as if it has been 
shot through Kleenex. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, real life looks darn good.

Q &amp; A: SUSAN LACY: MASTER OF THE 'MASTERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan King 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PBS' "American Masters," the Emmy- and Oscar-winning documentary series 
celebrating America's native and adopted masters in the creative arts, kicks 
off its fifth season Monday (8 p.m. on Channel 50; 10 p.m. on Channel 28) with 
a portrait of filmmaker Preston Sturges. Susan King discussed "American 
Masters" with its creator and executive producer, Susan Lacy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How did you come up with the idea for "American Masters"? 
</P>
<P>
I used to be at WNET in New York. I was the deputy head of performance programs 
and we did "Great Performances." We had no place at that time on PBS -- and 
this was seven years ago -- to air a regular documentary series which dealt 
with biographies. 
</P>
<P>
I think there was a kind of prejudice against arts programming and that it 
wouldn't hold an audience in prime time. I was confident if we did them well, 
the audience would be there. I set about doing it. 
</P>
<P>
The funny thing is it hasn't gotten any easier (to finance). This series has a 
slot and it's a perennial, but the money still isn't there for it. Given its 
success and the quality of it, one would have thought it would be more securely 
established. It's unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
Do you spend most of your time raising funds for the series? 
</P>
<P>
When you are dealing with programs like this and particularly in a series that 
is not financed, if I waited until I had $6 million, I wouldn't have any 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
We are dealing with older people on the series. Now that (jazz saxophonist) 
Dexter Gordon just died and we were going to film him for the program about 
(band leader/bass virtuoso) Charlie Mingus, I am very aware of the need to 
move, even without the capital. That is considered a no-no, but that's the only 
way this series has survived. I spend money I don't have, and then I have to 
make it whole and have it before I go on the air. 
</P>
<P>
How do you plan a season? 
</P>
<P>
A lot of things go into it. We also are working on any given time on infinitely 
more documentaries than we air in one season. We have long, long lists of 
important people and important people who knew the important people. We have 
some stuff in this season which was shot a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
The other night we shot the 35th anniversary of the New York Shakespeare 
Festival for a film we are doing on (producer) Joseph Papp. I don't have all 
the money yet to do the film, but we knew it was an event that couldn't be 
missed. 
</P>
<P>
There is a great huge master plan in terms of putting a season together. We try 
to have a balance in the disciplines. I am very conscious of women and 
minorities. My series falls during a (ratings) sweeps period and the national 
public broadcasting pledge drive. 
</P>
<P>
There are certain needs the system has during that time, and you tend to have 
more of the broad-based subjects on then. I feel strongly, though, a series 
like this has to have integrity, and you can't do a series called "American 
Masters" and only do pop stars and filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
Had you completed your documentary on John Cassavetes before he died last year? 
</P>
<P>
That's the only acquisition in the season. We wanted to make a film on 
Cassavetes and had started conversations with him while he was alive and was 
very ill. He wanted to do it and then he didn't. When I heard the BBC had done 
a film that involved all the people we would have involved, I asked to see it 
and thought it was excellent and bought it. 
</P>
<P>
The major emphasis in this series is to have the programs American-made and be 
our production and from our point of view. If there is an excellent film that 
is made somewhere else and the chance of us doing it is no longer there, I 
think it should be in the series. 
</P>
<P>
Have you had problems with certain artists who don't want to discuss their work 
and lives? 
</P>
<P>
(American artist) Jasper Johns -- he delights in being elusive and the film was 
very elusive as well. I wanted to call it "Searching for Jasper Johns." 
</P>
<P>
Some don't want to be filmed at this stage in their lives. Martha Graham is an 
example. Here is one of the great legends of the 20th Century. She's 95 years 
old and she's not going to be around. 
</P>
<P>
That record won't be there because she is so reluctant to be filmed as an old 
woman and seen as she is today. There is a vanity on some level and you can 
completely understand that, but posterity will suffer because finally the film 
will be made and it will be what somebody else has to say about Martha Graham. 
</P>
<P>
When we are dealing with artists that are still living you need their complete 
cooperation to be able to make a film that gets to their soul. If they don't 
want to reveal that, it's pretty tough to do it, and then it becomes 
subjective. 
</P>
<P>
Would you like to see "American Masters" become a year-round series? 
</P>
<P>
I certainly would like to see that. It's going into its fifth season and I 
don't see it going away at all. I think we play a real important role in the 
public TV schedule. If it disappeared it would raise a lot of questions of the 
purpose of PBS. 
</P>
<P>
The people who are chosen for the series are chosen for a reason. They have 
made a very substantial contribution to our national heritage in some way. 
People should know about it. 
</P>
<P>
If they don't, we are making it publicly accessible. We have an obligation to 
our children to make sure that the legacy of these people who have formed their 
culture is something that they know about. It's not taught in schools and it's 
just as important to understand the milieu of a Cole Porter or a Duke Ellington 
as it is to learn who led a Civil War battle.

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: LADIES HOME PRISON; 
</P>
<P>
70-YEAR-OLD MAGAZINE PORTRAYS HOUSEWIVES' LIVES AS DREARY AND ISOLATED DRUDGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
IN CLEANING OUT our garage recently I found a Ladies Home Journal for September 
1920. I have no idea when I acquired it, or why. I thumbed through it. If 
anything would make an instant feminist out of a man that old magazine would do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Almost every page reflects the benign imprisonment that was the American 
woman's lot in 1920. Although the 19th Amendement, giving women the vote, was 
ratified the month before, the magazine does not mention this new political 
power. Woman's place was definitely in the home. 
</P>
<P>
The cover is an oil painting of a young woman flanked by two attentive young 
men at the seashore. Her skin is pink porcelain; her eyes are blue. Her sheer 
white dress is daringly decolette. Her blond hair peeks out from under a big 
hat and she carries a pink parasol. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the cover a full-page ad shows a young woman very much like her in a 
work dress and dust cap smiling into a mirror she has just polished with Bon 
Ami. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the ads promote some house cleaning machine or cleaning agent that is 
supposed to make housework easier, so the woman will have more time (ital). 
There are a dozen ads for vacuum sweepers. One, the Apex Electric Suction 
Cleaner, shows a young woman sitting at a sewing machine while her mother holds 
an Apex sweeper. The dialogue is typical: 
</P>
<P>
"Mother, think how we all profit from your Apex Cleaner. When I'm at school I 
worry about you and your old brooms and dust cloths. You'll have this place so 
orderly that the neighbors will wonder how you do it and yet have so much time 
to spare. You've already got Dad guessing how it is that you seem so well and 
carefree, while the house is cleaner than ever." 
</P>
<P>
One wonders if that young woman on the cover had time to go to the seashore 
because of her Apex. 
</P>
<P>
Two pages later the Crysatal Electric Washer &amp; Wringer is extolled not only 
for "the marvelous way it washes even the most delicate garments," but also 
because its "sound design and rugged construction" appeals to "the man of the 
house." 
</P>
<P>
Fels-Naptha soap is hailed as "a dirt-loosener of the highest order." "You can 
sit down and iron at the Simplex," says an ad for the Simplex Ironer. (Does 
curtains, aprons, lingerie, shirts, child's dresses, tablecloths, napkins, 
center pieces, doilies, dresser scarfs, sheets and bedspreads.) 
</P>
<P>
A poinant full-page ad shows a woman standing wistfully by a chair in which her 
husband is engrossed in his newspaper. "A brief 'Yes' or 'No' and he's back in 
his paper; thoughts a thousand miles away--apparently he has forgotten you are 
there. What is the matter?" 
</P>
<P>
The matter, the copy goes on to suggest, is that she's so busy housecleaning 
and cooking that she doesn't have time to get out in the world and find out 
what's happening. The solution, it suggests, is Libby's canned meats. 
</P>
<P>
A poem, written in the folksy style of Edgar A. Guest, is called "Thou Shalt 
Not Kill," and accuses a wife of killing her husband with fried foods. 
</P>
<P>
An ad for an oven heating regulator shows a modish woman drawing on her gloves 
to go out (ital) while the regulator watches the pot for her. "You can be gone 
all afternoon without giving a thought to your cooking." 
</P>
<P>
In an article, "How I Tamed My Housekeeping Job," the author seems to have 
solved her problem mainly by hiring a 15-year-old schoolgirl to serve and do 
the dishes and light housework for $2 a week and board. 
</P>
<P>
Another article was by a young housewife who enjoyed mending so much that she 
hit upon the idea of opening a mending shop, and taking in mending, mostly for 
men, poor dears, who would otherwise be quite helpless. She was of course 
recommending this entrepreneurial escape to other young women. 
</P>
<P>
An ad for Johnson's Prepared Wax shows a woman in an apron in five poses-- 
waxing a table top, the arms of a chair, a bannister, a hardwood floor, and 
down on her knees waxing the linoleum. However, a man is shown waxing the hood 
of his car and a wooden cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
A vacuum cleaner ad boasts that "man works from sun to sun, but woman's work at 
NOON is done--if, in her daily cleaning tasks as caretaker of the home, she 
does not rely upon her own frail strength but depends on the inexhaustible 
power and energy of the OHIO-TUAC Electric Vacuum Cleaner." 
</P>
<P>
This magazine, which is gravid with isolation and drudgery, was for decades the 
bible of the American housewife. 
</P>
<P>
My mother was a housewife in 1920; she always aspired to the arts, but she 
never escaped. In her old age she painted by the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder what she would be like if she were 30 today.

The grasses in the field have toppled, 
</P>
<P>
and in places it seems that a large, now

<P>
absent, animal must have passed the night. 
</P>
<P>
The hay will right itself if the day

I miss you steadily, painfully.

<P>
None of your blustering entrances 
</P>
<P>
or exits, doors, swinging wildly 
</P>
<P>
on their hinges, or your huge unconscious 
</P>
<P>
sighs when you read something sad, 
</P>
<P>
like Henry Adams's letters from Japan,

where he travelled after Clover died.

From "Let Evening Come: Poems" (Graywolf Press: $16.95, cloth; 1-55597-130-X;

THE PRACTICAL MIND: DIVORCING A PARENT BY BEVERLY ENGEL (LOWELL HOUSE: $19.95)

On the face of it, Beverly Engel's premise -- that some parents, like some 
spouses, are basically incorrigible -- is a relief. Who among us, hanging from 
particularly gnarled branches of a family tree, haven't squirmed uncomfortably 
at the legions of therapists who advise us to forgive and forget. 
Reconciliation may only be possible once one has done so -- but aren't there 
some family felonies we shouldn't have to grin and bear? 
</P>
<P>
Engel thinks there absolutely are, from the obvious ones such as child abuse 
and alcoholism to more subtle forms of psychological and emotional 
mistreatment. If your parent's behavior debilitates you, and if that parent is 
unwilling or unable to change, Engel suggests that separation is as appropriate 
a solution to the disunion as it is in marriage; blood is not thicker than a 
marriage certificate. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that her solutions are primarily external (figuring out how to 
split from a troublesome parent who denies your efforts and still expects you 
to show up for Sunday brunch) or simplistic (a list of physical expressions of 
anger, designed to help purge animosity). She does not sufficiently address the 
real dilemma of the captive child, which is that he or she has managed to 
internalize many parental messages. Not seeing Mom or Dad is a first step but 
not the last word: The lasting question is how to keep them from jabbering 
inside your brain. 
</P>
<P>
"Divorcing a Parent" may look like a lifesaver to the segment of Engel's 
readership that is drowning -- people whose parents crippled them, who bear 
lasting emotional and physical scars. In fact, it's only a start, and the title 
does that vulnerable reader something of a disservice by implying that the 
split is, in itself, sufficient. To give Engel credit, the book is worthwhile 
if one sexually abused adult can find the courage in its pages to make sure her 
children are kept safe from the relative who, statistics show, is likely to be 
abusive again. But this book is a primer, a place from which to begin to build 
a healthier life, not the last word on leaving the past behind.

THE PRACTICAL MIND: DAYDREAMING: YOUR HIDDEN RESOURCE FOR SELF-KNOWLEDGE AND 
CREATIVITY BY ERIC KLINGER (JEREMY TARCHER: $18.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN STABINER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is the most seductive kind of self-help book, because it talks about a 
shared secret, daydreaming, that as yet hasn't been exploited to death on the 
afternoon TV talk shows. We all daydream -- and, given the amount of time 
Angelenos spend trapped on one roadway or another, we probably have more time 
to do it than most people. Klinger's book appeals to the narcissist and the 
neurotic in all of us: He's prepared to talk about our personal fantasies as 
though they were the most important thing in the world; he's also quick to 
reassure us that other people have waking dreams, too. 
</P>
<P>
Klinger manages a nice balance between his research and the inherently amusing 
nature of his subject, so the book is a bit more accessible than a more 
academic treatise might be. He sets the tone with the daydream report that he 
quotes at the opening to Chapter 1: "I am married to Harrison Ford or William 
Hurt. We are both medical doctors. We have six gorgeous, talented and 
well-behaved children. We are filthy rich." 
</P>
<P>
Don't you feel less nuts already? From there, he tells us everything we ever 
wanted to know about our conscious fantasies but were afraid to ask -- what 
daydreams say about us, how we can use them to learn about ourselves, what the 
benefits are of a little mental meandering, and how to address obsesssive 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
And he is careful, always, to keep one foot firmly planted in reality. His 
section on sexual daydreams, and the minefield of rape fantasies, is cautionary 
and honest. Klinger acknowledges that such fantasies exist and tries to analyze 
their elements, while making clear at every opportunity that such thoughts are 
not a literal expression of the desire to commit, or experience, sexual 
violence. He offers insight for the recreational daydreamer, and, for the 
dreamer more troubled by the private world that he or she creates, he offers 
the best antidote to despair -- information.

THE PRACTICAL MIND: HOW TO SELL YOUR BUSINESS WITHOUT A BROKER &amp; SAVE BIG 
COMMISSION DOLLARS BY DAVID P. FRANCIS (JOHN WILEY &amp; SONS: $59.95) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN STABINER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To amend Calvin Coolidge's famous dictum, the business of America, especially 
in Southern California, is small business. Trump trickles down: We all would 
like to be our own boss. 
</P>
<P>
Which explains why a publisher would see a market for a book such as "How to 
Sell Your Business Without a Broker &amp; Save Big Commission Dollars." When 
it's time for the owner of the metal-plating shop or the travel agency to cash 
in his or her chips, why not spend $60 on this exceedingly slender volume (only 
66 pages of text; the rest of it is a reproduction of all the blank forms one 
needs to sell), rather than the thousands of dollars the author says that 
brokers charge? 
</P>
<P>
All of that is perfect marketing theory, but its practical execution is as 
depressing a treatise on American business as can be imagined. In Francis' 
world, the owners of small businesses are incapable of even the simplest 
negotiations, and so lacking in knowledge that he must explain how to prepare a 
cash- flow chart and a pro forma profit-and-loss statement, two chores one 
would imagine any businessman to have mastered. 
</P>
<P>
The book is the entrepreneurial equivalent of programs to instruct 
already-pregnant teen-age girls in reproduction and sexuality -- you wonder how 
they were allowed to get that old, and reproductively ready, without learning 
what sex was all about. 
</P>
<P>
One has to wonder whether, if Francis' assumptions are true, the small 
businessman is adequate to even the most rudimentary forms of commerce. It's 
hard to believe that someone backward enough to profit from Francis' book could 
start, or run, a business worth selling. Perhaps he's trying to create a 
market, a demand, where one doesn't quite exist.

RERUNS TO RE-WATCH: ENTERING 13 HOURS OF 'THE TWILIGHT ZONE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joan Fantazia, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Viewers of KTLA's semiannual The Twilight Zone marathon will find much to keep 
them chained to their sets during 13 hours-22 episodes-of the series that begin 
at 9 a.m. on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Classic "Twilight Zone" irony is dished out in: "To Serve Man" (7:30 p...), in 
which aliens want to do more than just chew the fat with earthlings; "I Shot an 
Arrow Into the Air" (4:30 p.m.) about the desperation of a trio of lost 
astronauts, and "People Are Alike All Over" (noon), with a title that proves 
all too accurate. 
</P>
<P>
Evil lives in: "It's a Good Life" (7 p.m.), starring cute little Billy Mumy as 
an unholy terror; "The Howling Man" (1 p.m.), whom good people have a devil of 
a time trying to keep locked up, and "He's Alive" (2 p.m.), with Dennis Hopper 
as a neo-Nazi. 
</P>
<P>
A step into the future provides answers to a World War I coward who gets a 
second chance in "The Last Flight" (1:30 p.m.) and a 19th-century man heading 
West in "A Hundred Yards Over the Rim" (10 a.m.). 
</P>
<P>
Soul-selling has unfortunate consequences for "Jess-Belle" (9 p.m.), a woman 
who makes a deal with a witch to win a man, and a newspaperman who hires a 
"Printer's Devil" (Burgess Meredith, 8 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
Other typically heavy episodes are "The Purple Testament" (10:30 a.m.), a 
moving story of an Army lieutenant with a rare gift of sight, and "The Masks" 
(6 p.m.), about a group of unenviable heirs. 
</P>
<P>
The marathon lightens up with "Mr. Dingle, the Strong" (5 p.m.), starring 
Burgess Meredith again as a loser who gets a chance to be a big shot.

A REACTIONARY SNEAKS UP ON THE TRUTH; 
</P>
<P>
CONFESSIONS OF AN ORIGINAL SINNER BY JOHN LUKACS (TICKNOR &amp; FIELDS: $18.95; 
331 PP.; 1-55584-143-0) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Paul Hernadi, Hernadi, a native of Budapest, teaches English and comparative 
literature and directs the Interdisciplinary Humanities Center at the 
University of California, Santa Barbara. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Do you recall the 1960s, when only radicals were entitled to full Liberal 
credentials? By now, the pendulum has swung the other way. To earn his stripes 
as a solid Conservative, the prolific historian John Lukacs is well-advised to 
claim the status of a Reactionary. 
</P>
<P>
All such labels are troublesome, of course. The "reactionary" Lukacs calls 
former Sen. Joseph McCarthy "a radical vulgarian" and dislikes (the 
insufficiently conservative?) Ronald Reagan "not because he was a Hollywood 
actor but because he never stopped being one." Now and again, Lukacs will sound 
like a concerned populist. For example, he remarks that in a democracy, "more 
and more people speak," while in our bureaucratic society, "fewer and fewer 
people listen." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Lukacs' deepest convictions are firmly rooted, should labels be used, in 
conservative soil. The Hungarian-born former president of the American Catholic 
Historical Assn. appears almost allergic to any trace of Marx, Darwin, Freud, 
ecumenism, church reform and "liberation theology" in contemporary culture. As 
an impassioned disciple of St. Augustine and Blaise Pascal, he even rejects 
such time-honored ideas of enlightened rationalism as the "Cartesian and 
Newtonian views of man and of the universe." 
</P>
<P>
What does it take to be a reactionary? Reactionaries, Lukacs says, believe in 
original sin and the "immutable essence of human nature." His "Confessions of 
an Original Sinner" tell the story of how he came to hold this view and many 
related opinions expressed in his 12 earlier books. Published by commercial 
rather than academic presses, these books address a wide range of topics and 
include "A History of the Cold War," "Historical Consciousness" and "Outgrowing 
Democracy: A History of the United States in the Twentieth-Century." 
</P>
<P>
Lukacs grew up in Budapest a generation after Georg Lukacs (no relation), whose 
Marxist philosophy and politics he dismisses in a spiteful, ad hominem 
paragraph. At age 21, he experienced Hungary's passing from the German into the 
Russian orbit as a very mixed blessing. Having seen that Hitler's National 
Socialism was more popular in Central Europe then Stalin's Communism, Lukacs 
concludes that the forceful rhetoric of nationalist dictatorships represents a 
greater ideological threat to Western-style democracy than the "hopelessly dull 
and outdated" writings of Karl Marx. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet military power is a different matter altogether. For Lukacs, it has 
always stood for the ominous geopolitical aspirations of the East against the 
West. He notes, for example, that the looting, burning, raping Red Army that 
came to occupy Budapest in 1945 included many "narrow-eyed Mongols." His early 
opposition to the Vietnam War seems to have stemmed from similar geopolitical 
considerations. As an "anti-anti-Communist," Lukacs thought that "all of 
Indochina, South and North, Vietnam, Minh, Cong, were not worth the bones of a 
single United States Marine." 
</P>
<P>
Statements like this make you realize that Lukacs, who has lived in 
Pennsylvania for more than 40 years, wants to redraw the Cold War boundaries 
between the superpowers for Euro-centric reasons. He engagingly says, "Europe 
is my mother, America is my wife." But he shows no awareness of having entered 
something like an interracial marriage. 
</P>
<P>
As a self-styled reactionary, Lukacs proposes to pit a now old-fashioned 
"common-sense way of thinking against the abstract projections of progressive 
nonthinking." For example, he maintains (contrary not only to Marx but to Adam 
Smith as well) that "Economic Man is a myth" because "vanity is so much more 
powerful, and so much more wide-spread than greed." He even insists that "what 
happens is inseparable from what people think happens and that therefore the 
worth or the price of anything, even of the crudest piece of matter, is what 
people think it is." 
</P>
<P>
Along similar lines, Lukacs points out that sexuality "is in abstraction when 
considered independent of the historical and social situation of the lovers." 
He argues that, in general, we should pay much less attention to motives than 
to purposes: What matters is "not where a person's thoughts come from but where 
they are going." According to the doctrine of original sin, our motives will 
always be mixed: "Man is born imperfect and stays imperfect." But purposeful 
hope and "faith in a loving and forgiving God" make it possible for a 
reactionary to "believe in progress -- of a certain kind." 
</P>
<P>
The kind of progress Lukacs has in mind is emphatically not the lock-step march 
of brain-washed masses toward some earthly paradise. Instead, he clearly favors 
the progressive approximation of truth by increasingly enlightened individual 
seekers. Oddly enough, Lukacs ascribes to Kierkegaard G. E. Lessing's memorable 
sentence about just this kind of progress: "If God held all truth concealed in 
his right hand, and in his left hand the persistent striving for truth, and 
while warning me against eternal error, should say: Choose! I should humbly bow 
before his left hand, and say: 'Father, give! The pure truth is for Thee 
alone!' " 
</P>
<P>
In some context or another, the 19th-Century Danish proponent of faith beyond 
knowledge may well have cited the enlightened German writer's words of 1778. 
But Lukacs' habitual failure to document his quotations makes it hard to find 
out whether this is indeed the case. Perhaps his distaste for bibliographical 
accuracy and other customs of the tribe of professional historians has kept 
Lukacs from overcoming his life-long academic isolation. With resentful 
memories of a few visiting professorships at prestigious graduate schools, he 
takes great pride in having remained on the faculty of a small Catholic women's 
college since 1947. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the apparent crumbling of the Soviet empire, the reactionary Lukacs is 
very displeased with most turns taken by the contemporary world under radical, 
liberal, and conservative governments alike. But the harsh tone of his testy 
"Confessions" will wax lyrical whenever he speaks of the Budapest of his 
parents and grandparents or the Pennsylvania of the parents and grandparents of 
his American friends and neighbors. Indeed, Lukacs' "Budapest 1900: A 
Historical Portrait of a City and Its Culture" is a loving, informative, and 
beautifully illustrated book. 
</P>
<P>
Issued by the same publisher earlier this year, it provides more satisfactory 
reading than the lively but self-righteous and self-indulgent confessions under 
present view.

THE SEVERED SOUL A PSYCHOANALYST'S HEROIC BATTLE TO HEAL THE MIND OF A

THE UNTOUCHED KEY TRACING CHILDHOOD TRAUMA IN CREATIVITY AND DESTRUCTIVENESS BY

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Nancy Mairs, Mairs' memoir, Remembering the Bone House was recenty issued in 
paperback by Harper &amp; Row. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With something like a thousand books a week being published in this country, 
readers are threatened with drowning in an indiscriminate sea of detective 
novels, cookbooks, Baedekers, self-help manuals, romances, celebrity 
biographies. . . . If publishers could refrain from glutting the market with 
everything they can lay their hands on in even one genre -- "pop psych" books 
like "The Severed Soul," say -- literary standards might be salvaged and vast 
tracts of woodland preserved to protect us from global warming and overheated 
imaginations alike. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Strean lost my sympathies in the first chapter of "The Severed Soul," 
co-authored with Lucy Freeman. (The exact nature of Freeman's contribution to 
the book is not made clear, but in view of the implausible dialogue, hackneyed 
imagery and disjointed syntax, it can't have been literary.) 
</P>
<P>
I bore up as Strean catalogued the tasteful accouterments of his office 
overlooking Central Park and even as he platitudinized that "all patients 
should make sure their analyst is qualified." But then, having agreed to accept 
for psychoanalysis Nancy, the "paranoid woman" who has been "raving" in his 
office, Strean reflects: "This is . . . a powerful challenge, like trying to 
make par on a long and winding hole where you cannot see the green as you tee 
off." Poor Nancy, I thought, "caught in a cross current of the wish to kill and 
the fear of being killed," with a guide who views the human dilemma in terms of 
a golf match. 
</P>
<P>
As his self-aggrandizing subtitle suggests, Strean envisions himself charging 
into the psychoanalytic fray on his white electric cart to rescue a fair damsel 
in distress. Whether a battleground is an appropriate site for healing is 
questionable, although Nancy's distress certainly is not. Having lost her 
mother to cancer when she was 6 and grown up a kind of shadow-wife to her cold 
but seductive father, she is suicidally depressed and convinced that the 
principal of the school where she teaches hates her enough to poison her soup. 
</P>
<P>
She is far more privileged, however, than the schizophrenics I know. The 
daughter of a prominent gynecologist and the wife of an advertising executive, 
she readily agrees to "pay over several hundred dollars to lie on the couch 45 
minutes four times a week," 11 months a year, for more than five years. 
Stretched out there in her "fashionable dark blue silk dress," free-associating 
articulately, she'd make a striking contrast to toothless, smelly D, who is 
given to pitching cigarettes and paper towels around the restroom of the 
neighborhood center she frequents. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout her analysis, Nancy continues to hold a teaching job, unlike M, 
another schizophrenic of my acquaintance, who is too preoccupied ducking death 
rays from the television screen to keep track of a two-way conversation, much 
less a roomful of ebullient second-graders. But then, people like D and M 
aren't likely to wander into an office on Central Park West. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Nancy doesn't seem like the most representative choice for the purpose 
Strean puts her to: a model for his generalizations about the proper treatment 
of all schizophrenic patients. His heart seems in the right place, however, as 
he argues that by listening to and accepting Nancy's utterances, acknowledging 
her strengths as well as her weaknesses, and seeing himself and Nancy as more 
similar than different, he serves her better than the doctors who have 
previously locked her up, drugged her and given her both insulin and 
electric-shock treatments. And fortunately, during analysis Nancy does appear 
to achieve the self-forgiveness and self-control she needs to function 
responsibly in the world without unbearable pain. 
</P>
<P>
The tale of this transformation lacks tension, however, since we never see 
Nancy in her world but only hear, at second hand, her not very distinctive 
voice within Strean's book-lined walls. Such is the nature of psychoanalysis, 
"the talking cure," and although analyst and patient may perceive the process 
as intensely dramatic, Strean never quite brings it alive for the 
reader/dropper/voyeur. 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, since the same issues arise repeatedly and provoke similar 
reflections each time, the effect is static. On returning to Nancy after one 
summer vacation, for instance, Strean reports his feelings in almost precisely 
the same words he used the year before, right down to the threat he recalls his 
mother making: "Herby, do what I say or you'll be in deep trouble!" "Oh dear, 
poor Herby," a reader is likely to sigh at this point, "he doesn't seem to be 
making much progress at all." 
</P>
<P>
A self-confessed "compulsive workhorse," Strean once asked his own analyst: 
"You mean if I don't write a book a year, you'll still respect me?" He confides 
that this year's book, "as I realized while writing it, is my way of holding on 
to the memory of Nancy." For a complex of reasons, then, Strean felt compelled 
to write "The Severed Soul." You need not, however, feel similarly compelled to 
read it. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, if you enjoy the psychoanalytic method, you might try Alice Miller's 
slender book of essays, "The Untouched Key." Miller's premise resembles 
Strean's: that trauma experienced in childhood, if not permitted free 
expression, will cause potentially deadly psychic pain. Rather than presenting 
a case study, however, Miller takes the more characteristically European 
approach of textual analysis. 
</P>
<P>
In the light of what biographical material she can find ("biographers are 
seldom interested in their subjects' childhood," she notes), she reads the work 
of a variety of literary and artistic figures in terms of their early traumatic 
experiences. Her subjects include painters Pablo Picasso, Kathe Kollwitz and 
Chaim Soutine, comedian Buster Keaton, and philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. 
Crucial to the individual's ability to turn painful experiences to creative 
rather than destructive ends, she finds, is the presence of "a sympathetic and 
helpful witness who confirmed the child's perceptions, thus making it possible 
for him to recognize that he had been wronged." 
</P>
<P>
The consequences of a child's feelings of powerlessness and guilt that most 
concern Miller are not individual but social. The repression of those feelings, 
in order to preserve "the illusion of a strong and wise and benevolent father," 
leads to quiescence in the face of the evils perpetuated by society's 
"fathers," that is, those in positions of power, who are intent on waging war. 
</P>
<P>
Through a rereading of the myth of Abraham and Isaac, Miller urges "children" 
to question these figures and reject their destructive behaviors: "The new 
Isaac -- with his questions, with his awareness, with his refusal to let 
himself be killed -- not only saves his own life but also saves his father from 
the fate of becoming the unthinking murderer of his child." 
</P>
<P>
The pieces in "The Untouched Key" are too sketchy to be fully satisfying, but 
they stimulate the reader to thicken their texture with her own reflections. 
It's refreshing to be released from the couch, from the office, from the need 
to make par on that tricky fourth hole, into a world that depends on our 
psychological and thus our moral health for its saving.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: IN OUR OWN IMAGE THE COMING REVOLUTION IN PHOTOGRAPHY BY 
FRED RITCHLIN (APERTURE: $15.95, ILLUSTRATED)

<P>
A timely collection of essays on how computer technology is being used to alter 
the "real" images in still photographs, motion pictures and videotape. A former 
director of photography for the New York Times Magazine, Fred Ritchlin argues 
that despite its apparent simplicity, photography consitutes "a rich and 
variegated language, capable . . . of subtlety, ambiguity, revelation, and 
distortion." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly sophisticated computer graphics systems are giving editors the 
ability to tamper with photographs in ways that suggest alternate realities: In 
1982, National Geographic repositioned the pyramids at Giza to fit their cover. 
This rapidly spreading technology may soon allow people to present "records" of 
events that never occurred. "In Our Own Image" should be read by anyone 
concerned with how governments and the news media can manipulate information 
that people accept as truth.

<P>
Harold and Maude (KCOP Sunday at 6 p.m.) is that irresistible 1972 cult classic 
written by Colin Higgins, directed by Hal Ashby and starring Bud Cort as a 
suicidal 20-year-old rescued by Ruth Gordon's 79-year-old swinger. 
</P>
<P>
Without the affecting setting of the last days of the Somoza dictatorship in 
Nicaragua, the 1983 Under Fire (KCAL Sunday at 8 p.m.) would simply be a weary 
old love triangle involving journalists Nick Nolte, Joanna Cassidy and Gene 
Hackman; there's an edge to Nolte's growing loss of objectivity, but the 
filmmakers tend to walk away from it. 
</P>
<P>
Network (KTLA Tuesday at 8 p.m.) returns with its all-out assault on the evils 
of commercial TV. At the heart of this savage 1976 satire is Peter Finch's 
fed-up elder statesman of TV newscasters. 
</P>
<P>
The memorable 1948 Howard Hawks classic Western, Red River (KCOP Wednesday at 
6:05 p.m., also TBS at 8:20 p.m.), stars John Wayne as a tyrannical Texas 
cattleman and Montgomery Clift, who leads a rebellion against him during a 
cattle run. 
</P>
<P>
Bonnie and Clyde (KCOP Wednesday at 8:20 p.m.) is that 1967 American cinematic 
landmark in which director Arthur Penn, writers Robert Benton and David Newman 
and producer-star Warren Beatty join to re-create a 1930 heartland 
landscape-and then blow it all to hell in an astonishing crescendo of violence. 
With Faye Dunaway as an unforgettable Bonnie. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Petrie's thoughtful, autobiographical 1984 film The Bay Boy (KCOP 
Thursday at 8 p.m., again on Saturday at 3 p.m.) is an exceptional, complex 
coming-of-age drama starring Kiefer Sutherland and Liv Ullmann. Marred-but not 
critically-by a melodramatic murder (an actual incident in Petrie's youth). 
</P>
<P>
William Friedkin's 1988 TV movie C.A.T. Squad: Python Wolf (KNBC Friday at 9 
p.m.) is an efficient action piece involving a counter-terrorist mission in 
South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Blake Edwards' vitriolic 1981 Valentine to Hollywood, S.O.B. (KCAL Saturday at 
8 p.m.) is always audacious, often hilarious but sometimes downright appalling. 
Producer Richard Mulligan and his wife Julie Andrews, America's G-rated 
sweetheart, sex up their latest film to save it from disaster. 
</P>
<P>
KCET offers a terrific, vintage British double feature Saturday: Joseph Losey's 
The Servant (at 9 p.m.) and Lindsay Anderson's This Sporting Life (at 11 p.m.).

I was deeply touched by the March 13 episode of "Who's the Boss?," especially 
the scene in which Mona is in the hospital and her deceased husband appears, 
telling her of his love. I recently lost my husband of 42 years, and those were 
his last words to me before passing away. My compliments to the writers for 
such sensitivity and to Katherine Helmond for her warm portrayal.

BILL WOULD END CONFIDENTIALITY IN ADOPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A national group is pushing legislation in California that would strip the 
confidentiality from adoption records, revealing the identities of thousands of 
parents who gave up their children between 1938 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also would help parents find children whom they relinquished long ago 
and would give adoptive parents the same access to confidential records that 
their adopted children would be entitled to. 
</P>
<P>
The measure is sponsored by the American Adoption Congress, a Washington-based 
group representing people who have been involved in all facets of adoption. 
Enjoying bipartisan support and little organized opposition, the bill has 
cleared the state Assembly and is pending in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Although the bill's provisions are controversial and its passage would be an 
important victory for a growing national movement to open adoption records, the 
measure has received little public attention and is probably unknown to the 
vast majority of parents who would be affected. 
</P>
<P>
But word of the bill is getting out and opposition is building. A group 
representing adoption agencies opposes the measure and dispatched an officer 
from Washington to lobby against it last month. 
</P>
<P>
"This is incredibly extreme," said Mary Beth Seader, vice president of the 
National Committee for Adoption, which represents 146 nonprofit agencies 
nationwide. "We think this is a horrible idea that would be devastating to 
adoption if it were to pass." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, California parents relinquishing their children have had the option 
at the time of the adoption of allowing their names and addresses to be 
disclosed after their children reach age 21. Adult adoptees also have the 
chance to approve the release of personal information to their natural parents. 
Otherwise, the documents remain secret. 
</P>
<P>
But for those adopted between 1938 and 1984, the birth certificates, court 
records and adoption agency files are automatically sealed. Limited information 
is available to those born before 1938. The sealed records can be opened only 
by a judge who finds that "exceptional circumstances," such as the adoptee's 
need for medical records, outweigh the parent's right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
For many adults who were adopted, tracing their roots can be a nearly 
impossible task. Adoptees have long complained about the closed records, but 
have never mounted a serious attempt to repeal the confidentiality statute. 
</P>
<P>
Kate Burke has changed that. A self-described "ex-Berkeley radical" from San 
Francisco, Burke was recently elected president of the American Adoption 
Congress. She has rallied the group to push legislation in several states, and 
the California bill -- authored by Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush 
(R-Saratoga) -- is the most far-reaching. 
</P>
<P>
Burke, who was adopted and grew up in Chicago, at age 28 searched and found her 
mother in the Los Angeles area. Resistant at first, Burke's mother finally 
agreed to meet her -- at Disneyland -- three years later. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we're best buddies," Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
Burke has been touring the of fices of California lawmakers in tandem with 
Cindy Shacklett, who gave up her daughter for adoption in 1966 and did not see 
her again for 21 years. When Shacklett reached her child, she discovered that 
her daughter had been trying unsuccessfully to find her. Now they see each 
other regularly. 
</P>
<P>
With Quackenbush, who last year adopted a baby, Burke and Shacklett represent 
the three sides of what is known in adoption circles as the triad: adoptees, 
birth parents and adoptive parents. Together, the three groups probably include 
more than 1 million people in California. 
</P>
<P>
Burke argues that all of the parties to adoption deserve access to information. 
But she speaks most forcefully for the rights and needs of adoptees. As a 
child, she said, she was troubled by the way she was different from her 
adoptive father, an accountant, and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
"Finding your birth parent allows you to become yourself, because it allows you 
to see where you come from," Burke said. "You grow up not liking the parts of 
yourself that aren't like your mom and dad." 
</P>
<P>
California judges have been reluctant to unseal adoption cases, even for 
medical reasons. As a result, Burke said, adoptees are destined to uncertainty 
about their genetic pasts and medical futures. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would make original birth certificates and court records open to the 
inspection of adoptees and their adoptive parents. It require the state 
Department of Social Services to release information on the marriages and 
married names of the birth parents and the names of siblings. 
</P>
<P>
Birth parents would gain access to the amended birth certificate and other 
records, which show the names and addresses of the adoptive parents. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents warn that the bill would allow an unwarranted intrusion into the 
lives of women and men who gave up their children years ago and do not intend 
to contact them. They add that many adopted children may not want to meet their 
biological parents. 
</P>
<P>
"There are people who gave up their children for adoption who assumed once they 
did that it was settled for life," Seader said. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento), the only lawmaker to speak against 
the measure when it was passed by the Assembly on June 14, said closed 
adoptions in the past were a way for many women to escape the "social stigma" 
that came with bearing children outside of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"Particularly for older women, to suddenly have that confidentiality removed, 
willy-nilly, seems to me to be a basic violation of decency," Isenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to this objection, supporters of the bill have added a provision 
requiring the state to conduct a 12-month advertising campaign warning birth 
parents to contact the state if they seek to shield their identity. Parents 
would be allowed to sign a "reverse waiver" keeping their names confidential. 
</P>
<P>
Burke said this protection should be sufficient. She said only a small number 
of parents located through searches under current law reject contact with their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no requirement in the bill that the advertising effort extend 
outside California. And in today's transient society, Seader contends that many 
parents would never get word that their identities were about to be revealed. 
</P>
<P>
"Are we expecting people to check with the states every year to make sure that 
the rights they thought they had are intact?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
If the California bill passes, it could have an impact on the nationwide 
movement to open adoption records. Ohio, Texas, Pennsylvania and Michigan are 
considering similar statutes. Only in Kansas and Alaska are all birth 
certificates public records, but those states do not allow routine access to 
court records on adoption cases and other background information. 
</P>
<P>
"This is dramatic, landmark legislation," Burke said. "It isn't radical to us, 
but it is to people who aren't into adoption. I think this is something whose 
time has come."

ONE CURRENCY CELEBRATED IN TWO GERMANYS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barely five months after the first political decision was made, the two 
Germanys today implemented a monetary union, marking the first giant step 
toward full unification. 
</P>
<P>
The currency union constitutes one of the most significant, unusual economic 
experiments of the post-World War II era. Literally overnight, it made the West 
German deutschemark, one of the West's premier currencies, the currency of the 
centrally planned, former Communist country, East Germany. 
</P>

In East Berlin's sprawling Alexanderplatz, thousands of people gathered for the 
midnight changeover. Fireworks shot into the summer night as people cheered, 
sang drinking songs and brushed away occasional tears. 
</P>
<P>
The midnight opening of a Deutsche Bank branch in the vast square drew throngs 
of eager East Germans who clutched their new deutschemarks and scattered 
worthless East German change in the street. 
</P>
<P>
West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper autographed small East German bills for 
admirers. "This is almost like Christmas," said Enrico Rohmann, an 18-year-old 
East Berlin cinema worker. "I heard about it on the radio and had to come here 
to see what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
"What a weekend!" declared the mass circulation West German daily Bild Zeitung 
in its Saturday editions. 
</P>
<P>
East German television, which devoted most of its evening news Saturday to the 
subject, was carrying extensive live coverage throughout the day today. 
</P>
<P>
The deutschemark comes as part of a package that effectively extends most West 
German economic and social legislation to East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Although adoption of the deutschemark is likely to bring a sharp rise in 
unemployment as heavily subsidized enterprises go under in the face of stiff 
Western competition, it also gives a freedom previously unknown to 16 million 
East Germans -- a freedom to travel and to shop with money that anyone would be 
glad to take. 
</P>
<P>
Banks throughout the country were opening today, violating near-sacred bans on 
Sunday commercial trading in both Germanys. 
</P>
<P>
The branch of West Germany's Deutsche Bank, opening at midnight, was the first 
of thousands of Western companies to officially begin business in East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
In a nationally televised speech Saturday, East Germany's Prime Minister Lothar 
de Maiziere tried to steady his people, telling them to stay optimistic, be 
patient and keep their nerve through the difficult initial period that most 
economists expect to be characterized by high unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
"What we need is self-confidence," he said. "Let's begin with courage. We 
shouldn't just concentrate on the problems but see the opportunities, for few 
will come (to invest) if they see us give up." 
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the West German Bundesbank, Karl-Otto Poehl, also spoke on East 
German television Saturday, underscoring the need to attract strong private 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
Political observers believe that it is essential for the success of unification 
to maintain public morale in East Germany and to hold West Germany's political 
commitment to the cause of unity if costs of supporting the East grow. 
</P>
<P>
That the currency union is also a major step toward unification was apparent in 
many parts of divided Berlin, the old German capital, as barriers and controls 
seemed to melt by the hour. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic was jammed on both sides of the vanished border in the heart of Berlin, 
and cars honked at midnight as if celebrating a wedding. Border guard stations 
were dark and abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
Roads severed 29 years ago on both sides of the former site of once-famous 
Checkpoint Charlie were open Saturday, and traffic passed freely across a strip 
a few hundred yards wide that until last fall was walled and heavily mined. 
</P>
<P>
One traveler passing from East to West Berlin late Saturday evening found the 
East Germanborder guards ignoring traffic while they gathered around a farewell 
barbecue nearby, discussing their future. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday editions of most East Berlin newspapers reflected the mounting 
anticipation as the countdown to the new era moved through its final hours. 
</P>
<P>
"From Sunday, the first violin finally begins," said the independent Berliner 
Zeitung's headline, set over the face of a 20-deutschemark note decorated with 
a violin and bow. 
</P>
<P>
Said the liberal newspaper Der Morgen, "July 1, the start of a future of 
adventure." 
</P>
<P>
Both papers offered extensive features on subjects that have dominated kitchen 
table conversations in the two countries since the prospect of getting the 
deutschemark in the East emerged last February: "Where should I put my money so 
it gets a favorable return? How safe are pensions? How is it possible to buy my 
own house?" 
</P>
<P>
For East Germans, as for others who lived for the better part of four decades 
in the Communist, centrally planned countries of Eastern Europe, actually 
owning one's own house or choosing among different kinds of automobile 
insurance are exciting, yet completely alien concepts. 
</P>
<P>
Some West Germans were jumping the gun Saturday in an attempt to speed the 
transition. 
</P>
<P>
Along East Berlin's Friedrichstrasse, about 400 yards from the former site of 
Checkpoint Charlie, where East German border guards only months ago confiscated 
Western newspapers and magazines as decadent influences, stylish West Berlin 
models passed out champagne and sandwiches to those interested in learning 
about Western-style insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a growth market and I'm in early," smiled Manfred Lange, a West Berlin 
independent insurance agent. Lange said it took six months to determine if a 
prime location opposite the Grand Hotel -- a place used for years to store 
scrap wood -- could be rented and another several weeks to negotiate a lease. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to auto and life insurance, Lange said he plans to set up an 
electronic equipment repair service. His son, Thomas, who employed the models 
as part of his own business, called Dance Maniacs, said he hopes to fill 
another gap in the East German market by staging fashion shows at downtown 
department stores. 
</P>
<P>
From a safe distance, two off-duty Soviet soldiers observed events -- and 
members of the Dance Maniacs -- with a look of disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
In East Berlin and elsewhere throughout the country, stores cleared the final 
pieces of old inventory and began stocking shelves with Western goods, which, 
without the deutschemark, were beyond the reach of the average East German. 
</P>
<P>
The West German central bank, the Bundesbank, and the major West German 
commercial lending institutions have approached the currency union with the 
precision of a military operation. 
</P>
<P>
The Deutsche Bank, for example, has established temporary branches in trailers 
and hastily erected prefab structures -- all equipped with satellite 
communications to connect them to the bank's systemwide computer system and 
automatic teller services. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning early in June, the Bundesbank distributed the equivalent of $15 
billion -- 600 tons of bills and 500 tons of coins -- to banks throughout East 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
The amount, roughly twice the total of cash now in circulation in East Germany, 
was purposely high to avoid any possibility of shortages in the first hectic 
days of withdrawals, Bundesbank officials said. 
</P>
<P>
East German bills, which will remain legal tender through Saturday, must be 
deposited in a personal bank account to be exchanged for deutschemarks. 
</P>
<P>
In one of the ironies of history, the central storage place for the West German 
money has been the cellar of the old Communist Party Central Committee 
building, which has some of the largest vaults in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
During Adolf Hitler's Third Reich, the building contained the German central 
bank, the Reichsbank. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Alexanderplatz, the crowd stood around a modernistic world clock, 
waiting for midnight to come. The clock shows dozens of cities around the globe 
-- places that just months ago East Germans could never dream of visiting. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, it was 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, it was 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, it was 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
And in Berlin, it was a new day.

<P>
In its most important decision of the term that ended last week, the Supreme 
Court upheld Missouri's limits on the so-called "right to die" in the case of a 
comatose young woman. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's leading decision, also in a Missouri case, upheld the state's limit 
on abortion in public hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, neither decision endorsed Missouri's "right to life" philosophy nor tried 
to set national rules for the termination of a life or the termination of a 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, in these cases and many others, the Supreme Court under Chief Justice 
William H. Rehnquist gave state and local authorities more freedom to determine 
their own policies. Unless a state policy violates the clear words of the 
Constitution -- which itself says nothing directly about privacy, abortion or a 
right to die -- the Rehnquist court is inclined to uphold the states. 
</P>
<P>
Although this is a conservative approach to constitutional law, the results may 
be liberal in most parts of the nation. California and most other states, 
following the wishes of the majority, have maintained liberal policies on 
abortion and the right to die. Nonetheless, Missouri is now free to move toward 
a "right to life" philosophy that seeks to protect and prolong life in nearly 
all instances. 
</P>
<P>
This year, like last, the court usually sided with legislatures, school boards, 
the police or Congress. Whether the issue was the death penalty, drug crimes, 
religion or abortion, the court generally upheld governmental authority over 
broad claims of individual rights. 
</P>
<P>
Civil libertarians complain that the court is abdicating its historic role of 
protecting individual rights against intrusions by the government. 
</P>
<P>
"Both this year and last, the Rehnquist court has shown a willingness to defer 
to majoritarian rule when basic constitutional rights are at stake," said 
Steven Shapiro of the American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, in a concurring opinion in the right to die 
case, summed up the prevailing conservative philosophy: 
</P>
<P>
"No national consensus has yet emerged" on how to decide, or who should decide, 
when medical treatment can be ended for the hopelessly ill, she said. "Today we 
decide only that one state's practice does not violate the Constitution. The 
more challenging task of crafting appropriate procedures . . . is entrusted to 
the 'laboratory' of the states." 
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist and O'Connor said it is better to rely on the "laboratory of the 
states" -- a phrase coined by Justice Louis D. Brandeis -- to work out the 
intricate rules for when life can end, rather than having federal judges set 
the rules for all. 
</P>
<P>
This standoffish approach prevailed in most of the court's major rulings. In 
its 1989-1990 term, for example, the court ruled that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Drug agents may operate freely outside of U.S. borders without the need for 
search warrants. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Police may force a driver to submit to a sobriety test even though they 
have no reason to suspect drunkenness. 
</P>
<P>
 -- States may require doctors to notify at least one parent of a teen-ager who 
wants an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 -- High school officials may allow students to meet on campus for Bible 
reading. 
</P>
<P>
 -- States may make it a crime to possess child pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Prison officials may forcibly medicate disturbed inmates. 
</P>
<P>
In these decisions and more, Rehnquist gained the support of the three 
appointees of former President Ronald Reagan -- O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and 
Anthony M. Kennedy -- plus Byron R. White, a 1962 appointee of John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Last term, the five conservatives voted as a bloc, not only narrowly defining 
constitutional rights but also restricting the scope of federal civil rights 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, White switched sides on several crucial constitutional cases, 
creating a majority for the court's 84-year-old liberal leader, Justice William 
J. Brennan Jr. These rulings declared: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Elected officials may not use politics as a basis for handing out routine 
government jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Federal judges may order city or state officials to raise taxes to pay for 
desegregation decrees. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Congress may order minority-preference policies in awarding federal 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Again this year, Brennan wrote a 5-4 opinion upholding flag burning as a form 
of protected free speech, a ruling joined by Scalia and Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
With this perplexing mix of decisions, commentators affixed conflicting labels 
to the Rehnquist court. 
</P>
<P>
Former federal appeals Judge Robert H. Bork, who was rejected by the Senate 
when Reagan nominated him to the Supreme Court, said that the rulings 
demonstrate that the Rehnquist court is "really a moderate-to-liberal court." 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU's Shapiro said that it is "still a conservative court, moving in a 
generally conservative direction." 
</P>
<P>
What most surprised many legal experts was the very unpredictability of the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
"The streak of conservative victories came to a sudden stop," said Northwestern 
University law professor Lawrence Marshall. "Last year was a slam dunk for the 
conseratives, so some of what we saw this year comes as a shock." 
</P>
<P>
Several recent rulings shocked conservatives. "It's clear there's no consensus 
on the major issues -- abortion, religion and civil rights. It's still very 
fluid," said Richard Samp, chief counsel of the Washington Legal Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
On abortion, the court still appears split 4 to 4 to 1. Rehnquist, White, 
Scalia and Kennedy are ready to overturn the constitutional right to abortion. 
Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens strongly 
support the right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle sits O'Connor, who says that the states may regulate abortion so 
long as they do not put an "undue burden" on a woman's right to end a 
pregnancy. So far, O'Connor has not been forced to decide a case in which a 
state has directly blocked a woman's choice to abort. 
</P>
<P>
On the role of religion in public life, the court lineup is much the same. The 
four liberals insist that the Constitution demands a "separation of church and 
state." The four conservatives say that religion in the public schools or 
elsewhere is not a problem unless the government favors one religion over the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor takes a middle position. She says that the government may not do 
anything -- such as putting a creche in city hall -- that appears to "endorse" 
a particular religion or religion in general. 
</P>
<P>
Affirmative action stands by a different 4-4-1 split. Four conservatives -- 
Rehnquist, O'Connor, Scalia and Kennedy -- say that the Constitution's 
guarantee of "equal protection of the laws" means that the government may not 
discriminate in favor of blacks and against whites. The four liberals -- 
Brennan, Marshall, Blackmun and Stevens -- say that the government may in some 
instances favor blacks over whites because of this nation's history of racial 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, White joined the conservatives in ruling that state and local 
governments may not use minority-preference policies. But last week, he voted 
with the liberal bloc to say that Congress and the federal government can give 
preferences to minorities. 
</P>
<P>
White, 73, did not explain why he switched sides on affirmative action, but 
legal experts noted that he generally upholds acts of Congress. "White has long 
had the view that Congress can do many things (under the Constitution) that 
states cannot do," said Georgetown University law professor Louis M. Seidman. 
</P>
<P>
Besides last week's affirmative action ruling, the most surprising and sweeping 
ruling of the term grew out of an unlikely case -- a dispute over whether 
Oregon could fire two drug counselors who chewed peyote as a part of religious 
ritual of Indians. 
</P>
<P>
The court had no trouble upholding Oregon's decision to dismiss the two 
counselors. But Scalia wrote a broad opinion declaring that religious adherents 
do not have a constitutional right to be exempt from general laws that conflict 
with their religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the court had said that Amish children may be exempted from 
compulsory school laws and Seventh Day Adventists may not be required to work 
on Saturdays. Only when the government had a "compelling interest" -- such as 
need to get medical care for the dying child of a Christian Scientist -- could 
government officials infringe on a person's deeply held religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Scalia announced a new approach. The court will no longer force the government 
to bend its policies or make an exception to a general rule to protect the 
beliefs or practices of a religious adherent. 
</P>
<P>
In dissent, O'Connor said that this rule "is incompatible with our nation's 
fundamental commitment to individual religious liberty." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SUPREME COURT HIGHLIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
 In its 1989-1990 term, the Supreme Court received nearly 5,500 appeals and

MANDELA ENDS TOUR BY PROMISING TO RETURN

Anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela ended his 11-day U.S. tour on Saturday 
with a promise to return as early as October, and high on his agenda will be 
discussions with Native Americans on ways he can "help in their struggle." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, seemingly buoyed by the warm and celebratory welcome on his final stop 
in the United States, nonetheless was forced to cancel an appearance at a 
fund-raising dinner Saturday night. His wife, Winnie, skipped an engagement in 
Berkeley as the Mandela entourage left at 6:24 p.m. for Ireland, roughly 12 
hours ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela took about 10 people with him on a charter flight out of the country. 
Others in his entourage were to leave on commercial flights. Word of his abrupt 
departure came as the staff at the Oakland Convention Center were setting up 
tables for what was to be his final appearance on the U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
"The (scheduling) conflict is that he promised to be in Ireland," explained 
Roger Wilkins, national coordinator of the U.S. tour. "He also promised to be 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving, Mandela addressed more than 60,000 people at the Oakland 
Coliseum and apologized to a delegation of Native Americans for being unable to 
meet with them. The Native Americans had been among roughly 200 people who 
greeted him at the Oakland airport. 
</P>
<P>
"I can assure the leaders of the Indian community that I will return in 
October," Mandela said, adding that they had given him letters describing their 
living conditions. "We will exchange views on what I could do to help in their 
struggle." 
</P>
<P>
On his stop here, Mandela repeated his central messages: that the United States 
should keep economic sanctions in place, and that funds are needed to continue 
the fight against the racist South African system of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged the strong support his struggle had received in the San 
Francisco Bay Area, going out of his way to thank Rep. Ronald V. Dellums 
(D-Berkeley), who introduced the first anti-apartheid resolution in Congress in 
1971. 
</P>
<P>
REST WAS UP IN THE AIR:About the only rest Mandela received during his tour was

A 72-year-old man, with a rumpled shirt and sleepy eyes stood on the lawn of 
City Hall Saturday, quietly reflecting on what had happened there the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
"It was inspiring," said Juan Hernandez, one among thousands Friday who watched 
anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela speak from the steps of City Hall. "They 
all came together, black white, brown and yellow. That shows you what one man 
can do." 
</P>
<P>
After weeks of planning, preparation, and anticipation, Nelson Mandela had come 
to Los Angeles. And in less than 24 hours, Mandela was gone, off to complete 
his whirlwind U.S. tour in Oakland, and then on to Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
But he left some lasting impressions. The morning after he addressed 70,000 
chanting, fist-waving fans in a speech at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, 
the 71-year-old activist took an early morning stroll around the Biltmore, 
surrounded by a phalanx of security officers. He chatted with a few homeless 
people along the way, according to hotel manager David Flack. And before 
heading to the airport, Mandela shook hands and waved at the crowds who had 
gathered in the hotel lobby to see him off. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, those gathered at the places near where he had stopped in Los Angeles 
-- from the homeless sleeping in a square across the street from his hotel, to 
a UCLA student working at the Coliseum -- talked about how his presence had 
made them feel, and what impact, if any, his historic visit would have on their 
city. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Brown, 30, said Mandela's impact was tangible. 
</P>
<P>
"I know South-Central Los Angeles, for one day, had a sense of pride," said 
Brown, the swimming pool manager at Rancho Cienega Park, the meeting place for 
hundreds of students who marched to the Coliseum Friday in honor of Mandela and 
the anti-apartheid struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"There were people in the park yesterday who traditionally don't get along but 
yesterday they weren't going to ruin that moment," said Brown, referring to 
different sets of gang members who came to the park. "They didn't have their 
jeans hanging down, their rags hanging out. For that day they had on Mandela 
shirts. You couldn't tell what set anybody was from." 
</P>
<P>
But the fact remained that a surprisingly small crowd -- estimated by some to 
be no more than 4,000 people -- turned out to greet Mandela in Los Angeles' 
Civic Center, less than the number of people who gathered to see him last week 
in a Brooklyn schoolyard. 
</P>
<P>
It's apathy, said 68-year-old James Thomas, a retired city employee. "Folks 
just don't care, and those who do often take care of strangers before they take 
care of home. 
</P>
<P>
"The people want to donate money for the cause over there quicker than they'll 
donate to a cause here," said Thomas, as he sat on a park bench near the 
Coliseum, musing and munching on an ice-cream cone. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela "is working for better conditions for his people in his homeland, see," 
said Brown, who added that he supported his efforts. But "the way I look at it, 
there ain't too much he can do for the people here." 
</P>
<P>
Kimberly Menefee, 30, sat on the City Hall lawn with her boyfriend and said she 
thought people would be inspired -- but only for an hour or two. "They ain't 
going to care after that. People can talk a lot of stuff but they don't always 
want to act on it when the time comes." 
</P>
<P>
But Deron Thompson, a 23-year-old UCLA student working at the Coliseum said he 
had never seen so many people inspired as he did sitting amid the assembled 
crowd that had come to hear Mandela speak. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something you can always look on and say 'I was there,' " said Thompson 
who attended Mandela's Coliseum speech with his sister and a group of friends. 
"You could feel the energy. I think it'll make people go out and do something, 
change things. It just lifted them to hear what he was saying." 
</P>
<P>
Yellow banners, soon to fade, still hung on the streets of downtown Saturday, 
announcing a day after the event that Mandela was coming to town.

MEDICAL WASTE: TOWN TACKLES ITS BURNING ISSUE;

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Hampton got its incinerator plant in the mid-1980s, residents welcomed the 
big green facility on the outskirts of town as a friendly beast that would eat 
up tons of garbage and save space in the local landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, the plant operators, citing a need for more revenue, decided 
to burn medical waste in addition to the municipal refuse. 
</P>
<P>
Many people in Hampton feel that decision transformed the friendly beast into a 
modern-day Grendel that belches foul smoke and ravages their health. Medical 
waste from faraway places, like New York and New Jersey, began descending on 
the little hamlet in southern South Carolina before being reduced to ashes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible," said Sadie Gamble, referring to the plant's residue. "It's 
going to get into our drinking water and cause cancer." 
</P>
<P>
Officials at Southland Exchange Joint Venture, the plant operator, maintain 
that the plant's three incinerators are safe. 
</P>
<P>
But Hamptonians, angry and fearful, are not assuaged. In the state Legislature 
session that just ended, lawmakers, feeling pressure, passed a measure that cut 
in half the amount of medical waste the plant can burn. The cut was to have 
taken effect today, but Southland Exchange succeeded in getting a court 
injunction and continues to burn 100 tons of waste daily. 
</P>
<P>
The developments here come amid continued illegal dumping of medical waste, and 
a national trend toward building more incinerators to get rid of the increasing 
needles, syringes, bottles, body parts, and other items generated by hospitals, 
doctors, dentists, undertakers and others. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, there are 6,000 existing 
medical waste incinerators nationwide, and 60 new ones are being built each 
year. The nation's 7,000 hospitals generate about 10,000 tons of medical waste 
daily -- 10% of it infectious -- and about 90% incinerate their own. But the 
EPA is only just beginning to formulate regulations to govern the technology. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, from Savannah, Ga., to Susanville, Calif., supporters and critics of 
the incinerators do battle over where, and whether, they should operate. The 
battles, highlighting issues of health, environment, money, regional animosity 
and aesthetics, are intensifying as regional incinerators replace small 
hospital facilities. The fights are further fueled as landfills reach their 
limits in many areas and fears of contracting diseases such as cancer, AIDS and 
hepatitis rise. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Savannah, Chatham County officials passed an ordinance prohibiting 
transportation of medical waste on county roads or across county lines, 
effectively killing plans to build an incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Susanville, the permitting process is "60% to 70% there" for an 
incinerator, said Alan Siemer, project manager for Susanville Resources Inc., 
affiliated with the same company that runs the plant in Hampton. However, 
Richard Holmes, a high school principal and member of Citizens Against Toxic 
Emissions, said his group has collected about 2,000 signatures on a petition 
against the plant and will continue fighting it. An environmental impact study 
is expected to be released in August. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Hospital Council of the Greater Milwaukee Area, despite heavy 
opposition from local environmentalists, is forging ahead with plans to develop 
a facility that would burn used tires and pathological waste to make steam. The 
project has been thwarted several times when environmentalists cited flaws in 
the state's permit procedure. "We think it is a good project," said Marvin 
Neely, council president, "but there are those who disagree with us. The point 
is perseverance." 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Baltimore, officials at Medical Waste Associates said they will begin 
testing in October a plant that will serve 19 area hospitals, despite stringent 
protests from local residents. "A number of them won't be mollified until they 
see that we have established a track record after we are up and running," said 
Mike Murphy, a company official. 
</P>
<P>
"The role of incineration is one of the most contentious issues in (waste) 
management," declared a 1989 report by the Office of Technology Assessment, an 
arm of the U.S. Congress. "Public opposition to incineration has grown 
dramatically in many communities because of concerns about the presence of 
undesired metals and organic chemicals in emissions and in the ash residues." 
</P>
<P>
The report, "Facing America's Trash," goes on to say: "At the same time, 
however, incineration is attractive because it . . . destroys pathogens, can be 
adapted to recover energy and greatly decreases the amount of material that 
must be land-filled." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), chairman of the Small Business Committee's 
subcommittee on regulation, business opportunities and energy, charged at a 
hearing last year that "the regulatory safety net which protects us from 
environmental and health harm caused by medical wastes has huge holes." 
</P>
<P>
Government studies have examined alternative technologies for disposing of 
medical waste, such as the steam sterilization process called autoclaving, but 
incineration remains the disposal method of choice because of effectiveness and 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
And the bottom line emerging from voluminous materials from the Office of 
Technology Assessment, the General Accounting Office and the EPA is that more 
studies need to be done before it is known how risky the incinerators are. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a GAO report in March said: "Although it is generally agreed that 
some medical waste contains infectious agents, a clear consensus on the amount 
of threat to the general public and on whether medical waste is any more 
infectious than ordinary garbage has not been reached." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Crowder, a federal EPA official in Research Triangle Park, N. C., said 
medical waste incinerators are not regulated under the Clean Air Act, but that 
the agency is working on air emission standards. However, the federal air 
standards would not apply to existing incinerators, only to those built after 
the regulations are proposed in perhaps August, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
As for whether the incinerators are dangerous, Crowder said the EPA is 
"involved in doing field testing. There are no results back yet." 
</P>
<P>
But others say the hazards are plentiful, and obvious. 
</P>
<P>
For example, hospitals and other health care professionals are increasingly 
turning to plastic, throwaway materials. "Certainly when you combust plastics, 
you produce dioxins," said Dr. Samuel Epstein, professor of occupational and 
environmental medicine at the University of Illinois school of public health in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested turning to fewer plastics and more laundering, but health care 
providers defend plastics as more efficient and sanitary and less expensive. 
</P>
<P>
While many incinerators burn the waste at about 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit, Dr. 
Epstein called that "on the low side" for destroying harmful bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Hampton, a town of some 3,300 people, such issues rage. 
</P>
<P>
"If you bring up Southland in a conversation, you will get a reaction," said 
Laura McKenzie, editor of the Hampton County Guardian. "Just the name. It has 
caused some splits. Some won't be happy until it closes. Others want to keep 
their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
The center of controversy, the Southland plant, is a huge green, hangar-like 
structure, containing municipal garbage heaped on the floor and boxes of 
medical waste. Three incinerators burn the material at temperatures ranging 
from 1,400 to 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the ashes are taken to a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, the plant has been authorized to burn 100 tons of medical waste a 
day, along with an equal amount of municipal garbage. If opponents are 
ultimately victorious in court, the amount of medical waste will be 50 tons. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Ritter is a lawyer who has represented clients in cases involving toxic 
chemicals and is a member of the local organization For a Cleaner Environment, 
which has lobbied heavily against the plant. Fifty tons, she said, "is still 
too much." 
</P>
<P>
Ritter, who lives within a mile of the plant, complains about the odor and said 
she and others fear toxic agents from both the smoke and from ashes that are 
buried in the landfill and can leach into ground water. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Crews, Southland spokesman, showing a visitor around the plant, said 
that the medical waste is less dangerous than municipal waste. "You don't know 
what's in kitchen garbage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The philosophy we're dealing with is when you're dealing with the environment, 
you're guilty until proven innocent," Crews declared. Referring to critics of 
the plant, he said: "Some of these people, if we close down this facility and 
make it a flower shop, still wouldn't like it." 
</P>
<P>
Some would. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish we could get rid of that thing," said Murphy Barnes, taking a break 
from inspecting his garden crop of corn, beans and squash the other day. "It 
just ain't right. It's all right to handle what's in South Carolina, but I 
think every state ought to take care of its own waste." 
</P>
<P>
But Crews argues that Southland contributes greatly to the area's economy, 
employing 85 workers, paying almost $765,000 in taxes and user fees last year, 
spending $2 million a year on goods and services and getting rid of the area's 
garbage. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the plant has come in for some hard times. In addition to 
legislation mandating a 50-ton cutback, it was fined $242,000 in April by the 
state Department of Health and Environmental Control for allegedly violating 
rules on air quality and solid waste disposal. Southland is appealing the 
matter and will pay no fines meanwhile. 
</P>
<P>
Several residents asserted that respiratory illnesses are rising because of the 
plant's emissions. Dorothy Lightsey, school nurse for 20 years, said there are 
more colds, sore throats and runny eyes among students but added: "I don't know 
whether to blame it on Southland." 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Peden McLeod, who represents this area and is chairman of the 
Committee on Medical Affairs, summed up the feelings of many around here. With 
the landfill filling up, he said, Southland's facility seemed "an ideal 
situation" until it started burning medical waste. 
</P>
<P>
"We have nuclear waste, hazardous waste, medical waste," McLeod said. "People 
are tired of being the dumping ground for everything around. This is an overall 
grand mess."

WEST GERMANS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT REUNIFICATION, POLL FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD E. MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the expense, West Germans are surprisingly optimistic about economic 
and social unity with East Germany. They want to stay in NATO, but they also 
have a strong desire to ban nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
They like Americans, but they tend to prefer that North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization troops stationed on German soil also include an array of Belgians, 
Italians, Germans and Britons. Finally, their main concern, even ahead of 
economic unity and its inherent uncertainties, is the environment and 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
These are the findings of a new Los Angeles Times/Economist magazine poll taken 
in West Germany and West Berlin just one week before Germans embark on their 
historic first step toward becoming a single, powerful, unified nation once 
again. That step took place today, when East and West Germany combined 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
What has experts worried about this initial step is that West Germans might get 
caught up in a curious, yet potentially powerful, undercurrent of pessimism. 
Some politicians are concerned about German self-doubt. Others worry about the 
practical cost of rebuilding East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts say it could cost more than 1 trillion marks ($600 billion) to 
lift East German standards to those in West Germany in areas such as 
transportation, telecommunications, social services and finance. West Germany 
will bear the brunt of those costs. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the poll shows that 63% of West Germans and West Berliners view 
the coming 12 months with hope. Only 17% view the coming year with skepticism 
and 14% with fear. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, asked to name their two biggest concerns, a larger percentage of West 
Germans (65%) cited environmental pollution than either immigration (44%) or 
the effect of fiscal union with East Germany on their standard of living (42%). 
</P>
<P>
Also, 42% said they had a generally good impression of their treaty on economic 
union, while only 28% said their impression was generally not good. 
</P>
<P>
I. A. Lewis, director of the Los Angeles Times Poll, explained the apparent 
optimism this way: "Most West Germans today seem to be caught up in a wave of 
enthusiasm over reunification." But he warned: "If that generous impulse ever 
subsides, it will probably be the result of some first-hand experience of lower 
living standards." 
</P>
<P>
The poll was taken for The Times and The Economist, a British newsweekly, by 
the Allensbach Institute, a private polling organization in West Germany. 
Between June 22 and June 25, Allensbach personally interviewed a representative 
sample of 840 people. A sample of that size gives the survey a margin of error 
of plus or minus five percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
By a sizable margin, respondents to the poll said a united Germany should be a 
member of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
About 51% said this statement came closest to matching their opinion: "We must 
remain in NATO so that our security will not be endangered." Only 34% said this 
statement came closest to their opinion: "Military alliances are crumbling and 
will soon be unimportant. Therefore Germany should be made neutral." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a majority of the respondents expressed a strong and persistent 
preference for a ban on nuclear weapons from a unified Germany. A solid 54% 
agreed that "nuclear weapons should be removed from German soil." And only 37% 
agreed that Germans "cannot renounce nuclear weapons." 
</P>
<P>
The percentage in favor of banning nuclear weapons was highest among those who 
said they followed disarmament negotiations closely (56%). Those interviewed 
split about evenly on whether nuclear weapons should be removed from Germany 
even if it means all American troops went with them. 
</P>
<P>
Where the respondents balked was at letting the Soviet Union force a nuclear 
ban in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Only 25% agreed with the statement: "If the Soviet Union is prepared to agree 
to German unity only if all nuclear weapons are withdrawn from Germany, I think 
we should do so." 
</P>
<P>
That contrasted with 65% who agreed with this statement: "I do not think we 
should let ourselves be pressured on German unity. What is to be done with the 
nuclear weapons will have to be decided at the disarmament negotiations. That 
is the only way to be sure that everyone cuts back on nuclear weapons, 
including the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Forty-four percent said they like Americans; only 28% said they do not -- while 
another 21% could not decide. 
</P>
<P>
But the respondents tended to prefer that NATO troops in Germany be a mixture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Views on German Unification 
</P>
<P>
840 West Germans were interviewed June 22 and 25. 
</P>
<P>
A United Germany should: 
</P>
<P>
Remain in NATO: 51% 
</P>
<P>
Become neutral: 34% 
</P>
<P>
Undecided: 15% 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Do you have a good impression of the treaty between East and West Germany 
creating a monetary, economic and social union? 
</P>
<P>
Good Impression: 42% 
</P>
<P>
Not a good impression: 28%

2 POLICE OFFICERS KILLED; IRA CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY

<P>
A gunman opened fire on police on a busy downtown shopping street Saturday, 
killing two officers. The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
As shoppers watched, the gunman shot the officers and then fled through the 
grounds of nearby St. Mary's Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
The officers had been on duty only yards from a security gate at the junction 
of Castle Street and Queen Street, one of the busiest shopping areas in 
Belfast. Witnesses said they heard five shots. 
</P>
<P>
An elderly woman, speaking on condition she not be identified, said: "I must 
have come on the scene minutes after it happened. People were feeling for a 
pulse on one policeman, but I don't think he was alive. He seemed to be very 
young and only starting out in life. 
</P>
<P>
"You see things like this on television, but it's hard to take in when you see 
it at firsthand. The people who did this are a disgrace to . . . the land they 
live in." 
</P>
<P>
The second policeman died later in a Belfast hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The IRA, which has targeted the security forces in its fight to end British 
rule in Northern Ireland, claimed responsibility for the attack in a phone call 
to the Belfast office of Britain's domestic news agency, Press Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The deaths brought to four the number of Royal Ulster Constabulary officers 
killed this year, and to 29 the number of people killed in sectarian and 
political violence in Northern Ireland, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The IRA wants to unite Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland with the 
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Amsterdam, a bomb exploded outside the British national tourist 
office late Saturday, breaking windows but causing no injuries, police said. 
The building also houses the offices of British Airways. 
</P>
<P>
No one claimed responsibility for the blast, but officials there noted that the 
IRA has frequently targeted British facilities on the Continent.

EXPERTS SAY GORBACHEV REFORMS WILL CONTINUE;

PERESTROIKA: EVEN IF HE LOSES POWER, CHANGE IS IN THE WORKS, THEY BELIEVE. FOR

<P>
As Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev prepares for the crucial Communist 
Party congress this week, most American experts in and out of government have 
concluded that his reforms will probably continue -- possibly at a headier pace 
-- if Gorbachev himself loses power. 
</P>
<P>
"He is father of the revolution," a senior Administration official said, "but 
the children of his revolution have moved beyond him. Other leaders might push 
things along faster, like democratization, market economy, withdrawal from 
foreign commitments." 
</P>
<P>
But to the United States, this official said, Gorbachev offers something that 
none of his adversaries can match: That something is stability, and for now the 
Bush Administration values stability more than accelerated reform. 
</P>
<P>
"The faster the change, the greater risk of instability" in the Soviet Union, 
this official said. The explosive caldron of change could bubble over, he said, 
with enormous and possibly disastrous consequences for Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Many outside analysts agree with this view. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev is less indispensable to reform than he was a year ago," said the 
RAND Corp.'s Arnold L. Horelick, a former senior CIA analyst of Soviet affairs. 
"Indeed, he may have become part of the problem. But he is also indispensable 
to reasonable stability in the short term. So the dilemma is whether it's 
riskier to accept stasis with Gorbachev or accept the risk of doing without 
him." 
</P>
<P>
"We are on the eve of momentous events," said Walter Laquer, a Soviet scholar 
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "Gorbachev is fighting 
for survival." 
</P>
<P>
How he will attempt to meet this challenge -- move left or right, quit as 
general secretary of the party but remain as Soviet president, retire 
altogether -- is anyone's guess. So are the consequences if he retires 
voluntarily or is forced out by his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviet Union, for so many years the most predictable country, is now the 
least predictable country," observed Laquer, author of a new book, "Soviet 
Union 2000: Reform or Revolution." 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration has decided to continue working with Gorbachev at least 
until it can complete arms reduction talks and German unification accords. It 
has formulated its policies so as not to jeopardize Gorbachev's political 
standing at home. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not betting that he succeeds or even that he'll be around in five 
years," a senior State Department official said, "only that he's the most 
efficacious way to get there (into the mid-1990s) without violence. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the democratic movement in Eastern Europe to continue, we want the 
Soviet forces out of Germany, and we want German unification, we want START and 
CFE," he added, referring to treaties under negotiation to reduce both nuclear 
and conventional military forces. "These goals could be endangered if he fell." 
</P>
<P>
Most European states, particularly Germany and France, are even more frightened 
of the possible effects of Gorbachev's departure than is the United States. To 
help Gorbachev, they are pushing for a multibillion-dollar economic aid program 
for the Soviet Union. Gorbachev's fall, they believe, would be catastrophic for 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
Some American scholars are equally concerned. Without Gorbachev, said Columbia 
University's Marshall Shulman, his reforms would be "put on hold" and "disorder 
and even chaos" could follow. "He's still the linchpin holding that polarized 
situation together," said Shulman, a professor emeritus of international 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
Not so, argued Allen Lynch, a colleague of Shulman, in the current issue of 
Foreign Affairs magazine. Gorbachev was the "right man at the right time" to 
create the breakthrough in East-West relations, he wrote. But fears that his 
domestic failures will force a reversal of Soviet foreign policy and even 
Gorbachev's downfall are misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
"The disappearance or marginalization of Gorbachev would have a detectable 
impact on Western international interests," Lynch acknowledged. But "it is now 
unlikely," he wrote, "that a change in Soviet leadership -- or a change in the 
pace, scope and character of reform -- would have a corresponding impact on 
East-West relations and the most vital geopolitical interests of the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets need a benign international environment to pursue their domestic 
reforms, Lynch said. Conservatives in the Soviet Union accept this fact. Also, 
Lynch maintained, Soviet leaders recognize that foreign aggressiveness, such as 
the invasion of Afghanistan, causes a backlash in the West that far outweighs 
whatever benefits are to be gained. 
</P>
<P>
These factors mean that Gorbachev's foreign policies would continue without 
Gorbachev, Lynch predicted. "The sooner the West relinquishes its fascination 
with Gorbachev, the sooner it can assume responsibilities of a sober, long-term 
analysis of the foundations of its relationship with the U.S.S.R. and their 
consequences for peace," he said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. policy toward Gorbachev reflects President Bush's generally cautious 
approach around the world, particularly in relations toward China. There, after 
last year's massacre of protesters in Beijing, the Administration refused to 
distance itself from the regime as far as U.S. and Chinese liberals urged. 
</P>
<P>
More radical reformers are challenging Gorbachev. But as in China, U.S. 
officials do not believe these Soviets are yet capable of running the country.

The U.S. Embassy said today that Communist rebels had kidnaped an American 
Peace Corps volunteer and were holding him on the central island of Negros. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the United States recalled the 261 Peace Corps volunteers in the 
Philippines after intelligence reports indicated that Communist rebels might 
try to kill or kidnap the volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
American authorities had said previously that all the volunteers were accounted 
for. The volunteers began leaving the Philippines on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials identified the missing man as Timothy Swanson, 26, of Cheyenne, 
Wyo., who had been in the Philippines since February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A retired Roman Catholic bishop said Swanson had been friendly with New 
People's Army guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager it was believed the volunteer was abducted 
June 13. He said the embassy had made unsuccessful attempts to contact Swanson 
when the withdrawal of the Peace Corps volunteers was announced. 
</P>
<P>
Father Antonio Fortich, the retired Roman Catholic bishop of Negros, said in a 
telephone interview that Swanson's Filipino wife told him rebels had taken the 
volunteer from his home in the village of Patag. She said she was told to say 
nothing about the matter, he said.

after landing in Stockholm, police said. Police spokesman Lennart Pettersson 
said the 19-year-old hijacker was taken to Stockholm police headquarters for 
questioning. No one on the plane was injured during the hijacking, although it

On the anniversary of the coup that brought it to power, Sudan's military 
government promised to convene a national conference in August to shape the 
country's political future. Military ruler Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir, who 
overthrew democratically elected Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi last year, gave few 
details of the proposed conference, saying only that it would reject individual 
dictatorship, one-party or sectarian rule. Later, hundreds of thousands of 
people in Khartoum demonstrated in support of Bashir's rule, according to the 
official Sudan News Agency.

HEADSTONE FOR JAPANESE GIRL FOUND 45 YEARS AFTER THEFT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A headstone that marked the grave of a 3-year-old girl, the daughter of 
Japanese immigrants, has been unearthed at a construction site 45 years after 
it was stolen in the bitter final days of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The marker, topped with a heart, vanished sometime in the summer of 1945. In 
August of that year, atomic bombs destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, ending the 
war against Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The family of little Yu Natsuhara, who died in 1911 when she was struck by a 
car on a downtown street, had been interned at camps in California and Idaho 
during the war. 
</P>
<P>
"I came back right at the end of the war, in September of 1945. I went over to 
the old Pioneer Cemetery, and the stone was missing," recalled Frank Natsuhara, 
79, who was about 5 months old when the child died. 
</P>
<P>
"My older sister knew her and still remembers her," Natsuhara said, referring 
to Mary Natsuhara Takemura, now in her 80s and living in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"She'll be real happy to hear it's been found." 
</P>
<P>
Their parents were dismayed by the theft, Natsuhara recalled, and his father 
poured a concrete slab at the grave site, inscribing it with the little girl's 
name. The desecration troubled some family members for many years. 
</P>
<P>
The stone is inscribed in Japanese on one side and English on the other. 
</P>
<P>
"Miss Iyu Natsuhara, Died Aug. 18, 1911, Age 3 Yrs," it says, though family 
records all refer to the toddler as "Yu." 
</P>
<P>
The backhoe that unearthed the marker left a few nicks, but "it's a pretty 
stone," Natsuhara said. "It's still a pretty stone." 
</P>
<P>
The marker will be restored to the grave site, he said -- nearly 80 years after 
his sister's death. 
</P>
<P>
Workers found the gravestone buried about seven feet below the surface after 
they tore up a driveway to make room for an addition behind Highline High 
School, built in 1924. 
</P>
<P>
A school gymnasium was completed in 1946, and the vandals who stole Yu's 
gravestone may have left it in a ditch or trench dug for that project, 
speculated Jerry Heigh, director of facilities for the Highline School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
"Or maybe it was left on a pile of dirt somewhere, then got bulldozed in," 
Height said. "We'll never know." 
</P>
<P>
A check of the local telephone directory led district officials to Frank 
Natsuhara, who was given the gravestone last week. 
</P>
<P>
He and his sister are among five survivors of the 11 children born to Sen and 
Chiyokichi (Charley) Natsuhara, who left Japan in the early 1900s for this city 
about 15 miles south of Seattle, which now has a population of about 32,000. 
</P>
<P>
The family opened a general merchandise and farm supply store in 1916, now the 
site of Natsuhara's, an Asian import and specialty grocery store owned by Frank 
Natsuhara.

PROPOSED FEES TO BALANCE BUDGET MAY SPOIL PICNICS;

<P>
If you are a camper, you may be asked to shell out $30 to stay overnight in a 
state park. Or pay $9 for a daytime picnic spot. 
</P>
<P>
If you want a copy of your birth certificate from the state, a charge of $15 
may await you. 
</P>
<P>
Or, if you have a home, barn or other building on state-owned wild lands, a new 
$12.50 yearly fee per structure for fire protection may be in your future. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, if you are a University of California or state university student, 
drinking-water provider, pesticide producer or mentally retarded Californian, 
new or higher levies might be heading your way. 
</P>
<P>
This smorgasbord of potential revenue hikes -- some in the form of taxes, some 
as new or increased fees -- has been offered up by Democratic and Republican 
legislators and their nonpartisan financial adviser as possible ways to help 
close the record $3.6-billion state budget gap. 
</P>
<P>
In varying forms, Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), Senate 
Republican floor leader Ken Maddy of Fresno and Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg 
(D-Sacramento) have separately advanced long lists of levies that could be 
increased or imposed for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Legislative Analyst Elizabeth G. Hill, whose office is nonpartisan, came up 
with her own list of programs that could be freed of support from general 
taxpayers and become entirely self-supporting. 
</P>
<P>
In seeking to balance the $56-billion budget, Gov. George Deukmejian and 
legislative leaders reached an impasse Wednesday, but agreed to restart 
negotiations Monday, one day after start of the new fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Deukmejian's first budget in 1983, which contained $450 million in 
similar revenue increases to achieve a balance, the current financial situation 
is far more serious. To what extent Deukmejian and legislative leaders will 
agree to enact new or increase old sources of revenues is far from decided. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, while stressing she is not recommending enactment of all the revenue 
sources she listed, offered about $393 million worth of "options" to the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
She said she tried to give legislators a broad range of alternatives for 
consideration. However, she stressed that some "severe" options would not be in 
the "best long-term interest of the state." 
</P>
<P>
One drastic option she advanced would close some or all components of 
California's prized state parks system and make $74.5 million available to 
balance the budget, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative, she advanced a whopping 200% increase in fees paid by state 
parks users. But she warned that tripling fees would likely cut back attendance 
and ultimately demand renewed support from taxpayers "to backfill for reduced 
visitation." 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, fees for picnic sites and other day use would generally 
increase from $3 to $9, overnight campsites from $10 to $30, recreational 
vehicle sites with full hookups from $16 to $48, and group campsites from $30 
and $150 a night to $90 and $450. 
</P>
<P>
Users of state parks in the South Coast area already pay slightly higher fees 
than those charged in other parts of the state and would pay proportionately 
higher fees. Park fees last were increased statewide in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Another option, Hill said, would be to establish an ability-to-pay test for 
mentally retarded Californians and their families who receive free diagnostic 
and treatment services from 21 regional centers statewide. This could raise $38 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Hill also suggested that general tax dollars to support regulation of the 
pesticide industry could be eliminated if current taxes paid by pesticide 
producers and distributors were increased by $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, she proposed extending to all fruits, vegetables, nuts and field 
crops the fees now imposed on certain commodities for research and promotional 
activities. The resulting $15.2 million would be earmarked for pest detection 
and eradication, such as the Southern California Medfly project.

A Los Angeles Fire Department firefighter was slightly injured Saturday when 
his belt buckle became caught on a vehicle door as a suspect tried to drive 
away from the scene of an investigation, authorities said.

The firefighter, who suffered minor abrasions in the incident, was dragged more 
than 100 feet by the suspect, who had been under investigation for allegedly 
selling illegal fireworks behind a convenience store in Reseda, said Fire 
Department spokesman Pat Marek. 
</P>

"It was a standard Fire Department leather belt with a 2-inch-wide metal 
buckle," Marek said. "He was dragged about 100 feet until the buckle broke."

MAN SLAIN NEAR MARINA DEL REY; POLICE BELIEVE ROBBERY WAS MOTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robbery was the apparent motive in the shooting death of a Mar Vista man found 
dead of multiple gunshot wounds near a Ballona Creek bicycle path Saturday 
morning, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
A passer-by discovered the man's body on an embankment in the largely 
undeveloped wetlands area near Marina del Rey at 6 a.m., about half a mile east 
of Lincoln Boulevard, said Sgt. Danny Graham, watch commander at the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
David Campbell, supervising investigator for the Los Angeles County coroner's 
office, identified the man as John Carl Jones, 46. 
</P>
<P>
"He was dead at the scene," Graham said. "He sustained multiple gunshot wounds 
and robbery is the apparent motive." 
</P>
<P>
Graham, who declined to give further details, said the investigation is 
continuing.

ELMER JONES; BANNER MAKER HELPED DESIGN L.A. CITY FLAG

<TEXT>
<P>
Elmer S. Jones, flag, banner and bunting maker to Southern California and the 
world, has died. He was 92. 
</P>
<P>
Jones died Wednesday at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital, where he was recently 
hospitalized. He had been bedridden for the last six months because of 
complications from a broken hip. 
</P>
<P>
Before his hip fracture, Jones had worked steadily five days a week at his 
Jones Decorating Co., 2807 Sunset Blvd., which he founded in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
"His work was his life," said Alfredo Rubalcava, Jones' stepson, who also works 
at the decorating concern. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Illinois, Jones moved to Los Angeles in the early 1920s, sleeping in 
the park or bunking with a friend until he found a job. 
</P>
<P>
He was hired at 35 cents an hour by a decorator to festoon a new Elks Club in 
Oxnard for its dedication, and decided there was enough money in the parade and 
event decorating business to make that his lifework. 
</P>
<P>
After his boss went bankrupt when a client failed to pay, Jones took over the 
business and set it up under his own name in 1926. He adopted the ambitious 
advertising slogan "Jones Does Everything," later refined to "Just the Best." 
</P>
<P>
Within a year Jones hit the big time when he was hired to festoon Los Angeles 
city streets for the visit of Charles Lindbergh after "Lucky Lindy's" historic 
flight across the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
That same year, Jones created electrical floats for a Boulder Dam parade in Los 
Angeles, and in 1928 he hung airplanes over the streets for the National 
Aeronautical Exposition and Air Races and decorated City Hall for its 
dedication.

<P>
In 1931, Jones helped design the current flag for the city of Los Angeles, 
incorporating its newly designed seal in a three-color background of yellow, 
green and red as part of its mammoth 150th anniversary celebration. 
</P>
<P>
In 1932, he decorated streets, buildings, stores, City Hall and the Coliseum 
for the Olympics. When the games returned to Los Angeles in 1984, Jones was the 
official purveyor of Olympic flags, pennants and other memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
Jones put the special decorating touches on Pasadena for the Tournament of 
Roses for 40 years (1932-72), and decorated for some of the Academy Awards 
presentations, the Orange Show in San Bernardino and the 1935 San Diego 
Exposition. 
</P>
<P>
Dabbling in politics, Jones festooned Gilmore Field for a speech by President 
Harry S Truman in 1948, hung the bunting for the 1960 Democratic National 
Convention in Los Angeles, and made British flags for the visit of Queen 
Elizabeth II in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, a World War I Navy veteran, manufactured 100,000 code flags for the Navy 
during World War II and decorated the scene of 100 Army and Navy award 
ceremonies. During the Vietnam War, he sent hundreds of California state flags 
to servicemen who requested them through Gov. Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
As the demand for parade decorating declined, Jones shifted part of his energy 
to a year-round Christmas store patronized primarily by film studios. The 
operation was a spinoff of his many years of decorating Broadway's flagship 
downtown store for Christmas and all of Hollywood for the annual Santa Claus 
Lane Parade. 
</P>
<P>
Despite failing eyesight, Jones personally continued to handle about 100 
decorating projects a year. 
</P>
<P>
Jones is survived by his wife, Mary, four stepchildren and two grandchildren.

A knife fight blamed on racial tension led to the fourth inmate lock-down this 
month at San Quentin prison, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 inmates were restricted to their cells on Thursday, and the 
institution was searched for homemade weapons. Inmate visits were restricted 
indefinitely to attorney visits and planned conjugal visits. A dozen inmates 
were slightly hurt in the exercise yard melee. Four inmates were stabbed, and 
guards confiscated 13 crude knives.

A hydrochloric acid spill on Interstate 15 near Baker closed several lanes of 
the highway from Los Angeles to Las Vegas for hours as road crews worked to 
remove the caustic chemical, authorities said Saturday. California Highway 
Patrol officials said the driver of a tank truck carrying the chemical found a 
crack in the tank when he stopped to check his brakes a mile north of the 
Halloran Springs exit and 11 miles north of Baker. 
</P>
<P>
About 600 gallons of acid leaked, authorities said. Road crews were draining 
the rest of the acidic cargo onto dirt beside the road and planned to transfer 
the dirt to another tank truck. In the interim, CHP officials advised travelers 
to take Interstate 40 east from Barstow to U.S. 95, north to the Nevada state 
line and then into Las Vegas.

San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos has announced that because a homeless shelter 
will open soon, the homeless will no longer be allowed to camp at Civic Center 
Plaza across from City Hall. Scores of indigents, mentally ill people and 
runaways have lived under the park's olive trees for more than two years. The 
mayor, who has come under criticism for not enforcing laws against spending the 
night in public parks, promised last year to begin moving the homeless off the

<P>
VENTUROPOLY: DOZENS OF LOCAL MERCHANTS BOUGHT GAME SPACE FOR ADVERTISING. SOME 
SAY THEY MADE A GREAT DECISION. OTHERS SAY THEY WASTED THEIR MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Life in Ventura County has its ups and downs for some people, but it's all just 
a game for others. 
</P>
<P>
And the name of the game is Venturopoly. For four years, a stylized version of 
the classic board game Monopoly with a local twist has been selling steadily 
throughout Ventura County in bookstores, toy shops and even a hairstyling 
salon. 
</P>
<P>
The theme of Venturopoly seems to be that the main activities of county 
residents are driving down the Ventura Freeway, selling their farms to shopping 
mall developers, fighting for the environment and getting hit with exorbitant 
parking tickets. 
</P>
<P>
In the game, there are winners and losers. And in the marketing of the game 
over the last four years, there have also been winners and losers: 
</P>
<P>
Among the dozens of local merchants who bought board space to advertise their 
products, some say they made a great decision, others that they wasted their 
money on a bad investment. 
</P>
<P>
"On your way to riches, you'll buy and subdivide large tracts of land, strike 
it rich in the oil fields, or get stung by the schemes of other wily 
speculators," warns an advertisement printed on every box of Venturopoly. 
</P>
<P>
The words of wisdom are meant for prospective players, but Venturopoly 
investors have found out since the introduction of the game in 1986 that the 
same principle applies in the real world. 
</P>
<P>
To have its name on one of the game board's 46 spaces, each business paid $700 
to Santa Barbara resident Frank Critchlow, who created and marketed the game. 
In return, they got 36 Venturopoly sets for free. Those who sold out the games 
at the recommended price of $20 a set recovered their investment, but many 
failed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Rhodes, owner of Standard Beauty Supply and Salon struck it rich. Her 
shop has sold over 100 games, which are discreetly displayed next to hair 
sprays and brushes and eye shadows. 
</P>
<P>
"People come in and pick it up because it is so unique and it makes a great 
gift," Rhodes said. "I knew I could market it because women are good shoppers 
and when they come here they're willing to spend money." 
</P>
<P>
John Holden, president of Century 21 County Center Realty, got stung. "We 
didn't get anything out of it," he said. "Nobody listed their home with us 
because they played Venturopoly, and we ended up giving the games away because 
we couldn't sell them." 
</P>
<P>
Like Monopoly, which is based on the entrepreneurial spirit embedded in the 
American Dream, the goal of Venturopoly is to become a millionaire, with the 
first player to make $1 million in cash the winner. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike Monopoly, financial greed in Venturopoly is tempered by concern for 
the environment, the region's history and even a shade of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
In the world of Venturopoly, the Save the Oaks Society can make you lose a 
turn, cars conk out on the freeway's Conejo Grade overpass, and Chumash Indian 
heads adorn dollar bills. The old family farm gets unscrupulously sold to 
"another shopping mall developer." 
</P>
<P>
It's a portrait of Ventura County that locals and tourists seem to relate to, 
if game sales are any indication -- more than 3,000 sets sold since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
For the people who play it, Venturopoly reminds them of what makes their county 
special. "It has to do with our folklore and our heritage," said Saticoy 
Elementary School Principal Nancy Bradford, a Venturopoly enthusiast who has 
sold dozens of games to raise money for her school's PTA. 
</P>
<P>
The Ojai Music Festival, the Conejo Valley Days and the Ventura County Fair are 
always a roll of the dice away. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like playing with your neighbors," said Hilda Cooper, who manages the 
Livery bookstore in downtown Ventura, which sells six to eight games a month, 
20 to 30 during the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
The game board, she said, "is like a shopping directory of Ventura County, and 
you know all the stores." 
</P>
<P>
In the Monopoly square belonging to, say, Park Place, Venturopoly has Santa 
Paula Savings. In place of Monopoly's Connecticut Avenue is Venturopoly's 
Andria's Seafood restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Venturopoly creator Critchlow, 36, is an unlikely entrepreneur. He barely makes 
enough money to split with his brother the $925 rent on a Santa Barbara house. 
The garage has headquartered his one-man toy company, Wizdom Games, since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Strange as it may sound, the man who puts millions of play dollars of 
Venturopoly money into every game swears he's perfectly content with his 
$25,000-a-year income and does not intend to get rich. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to make a huge profit I'd have to go national, and my philosophy is 
to reach a level of survival and not try to expand," Critchlow said. "Here in 
Santa Barbara we like to live within our means." 
</P>
<P>
Critchlow started out working for a San Francisco-based toy company, where he 
was responsible for designing Monopoly-type games for several cities, including 
Washington, New Orleans and Dallas-Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
"I got excited with the concept and decided to go out on my own," he said. In 
1984, he came out with Santa Barbopoly, featuring Nancy and Ronnie dollar bills 
and the well-known Moreton Bay Fig Tree homeless corner, where players go to 
beg money from their rivals when they become bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
More than 6,000 Santa Barbopoly games have been sold so far. "The tourists love 
it, especially the Japanese. They want something from Santa Barbara to take 
home," Critchlow said. 
</P>
<P>
Critchlow is currently at work designing SLOpoly, the San Luis Obispo version, 
in which the game ends suddenly and nobody wins if a player rolls a double and 
lands on the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant, precipitating a "nuclear meltdown." 
</P>
<P>
He said that SLOpoly will be Wizdom Games' last real estate game. The next 
project involves a "chess-type game with lasers and robots," Critchlow said. 
</P>
<P>
As for Venturopoly, Critchlow plans to update it once he sells out his first 
batch of 5,000 games. The next version, he promises, will acknowledge the 
re-emergence of the Oxnard Trolley.

JURY VERDICT MAY OPEN DOORS FOR THE MENTALLY ILL; 
</P>
<P>
DILEMMA: A $52,778 AWARD TO A PATIENT MAY BROADEN THE RIGHTS OF THE MENTALLY 
ILL. BUT MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WARN THAT IT WILL BE HARDER TO KEEP SICK PEOPLE 
FROM HARMING THEMSELVES AND OTHERS. 
</P>

<P>
Rosalie Crawford was found wandering around a men's bathroom at San Diego's 
Lindbergh Field last Aug. 8, saying that witches were after her. 
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old Long Beach grandmother was locked in the psychiatric unit at UC 
San Diego Medical Center, where doctors say she continued to be delusional for 
more than a month. Repeatedly, her attorney says, she asked to be released and 
refused to take medication. But she was kept locked up anyway, and was injected 
with psychotropic drugs when she wouldn't swallow them. 
</P>
<P>
A judge finally ordered her release Sept. 21, and she went home to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Nine months later, on June 15, a San Diego County Superior Court jury awarded 
Crawford $52,778. The jurors concluded that the hospital falsely imprisoned her 
and committed assault and battery when its employees forced medication on her 
during the last part of her stay there. 
</P>
<P>
The case has touched a sore point in the mental health community, and those 
familiar with the case are fiercely taking sides. The verdict is being lauded 
by some as a victory for the legal rights of the mentally ill in California. It 
is being lambasted for tying the hands of those who want to help the mentally 
ill. 
</P>
<P>
It could be years, lawyers say, before a clear answer emerges to a difficult 
question: Are there circumstances in which it is proper for doctors to keep a 
mentally ill person locked up, even after the law says the person must be 
released? 
</P>
<P>
"In a courtroom, 12 jurors said a mentally ill person does have stated wishes," 
said Evvy Garrett, a longtime San Diego activist for mental health rights. "To 
us it really signifies a slight turning in the thinking of the general 
population toward the mentally ill. And it's real significant." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Allan Adler, medical director at Alvarado Parkway Institute, a psychiatric 
hospital, is outraged by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"What it does is put the hospitals and the physicians in the position of really 
practicing with not looking at the interest of the patient, but looking at all 
these legal things," said Adler, who testified for the defense in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"Theoretically, if a patient says, 'I'm going to go kill someone,' you can't 
stop him because the 14 days (that he can be held in the hospital) are up." 
</P>
<P>
During the trial, UCSD had contended that, because of her paranoid 
schizophrenia, Crawford might be dangerous to other people as well as to 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
Even those who take a less dramatic view of the case acknowledge that it 
illuminates a dilemma in state mental health law that in recent years has 
caused hospitals to sometimes hold the mentally ill longer than is allowed by 
law. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not condoning this practice, nor am I saying it's commonplace. But I've 
certainly known it to occur," said Barbara Lurie, the head of the office in Los 
Angeles County that is charged with protecting the rights of mental health 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
"I think when facilities do it, they know they're on pretty shaky ground and 
they shouldn't be doing it, but it's like they have no real legal recourse, and 
it's a very unusual and compelling circumstance," Lurie said. 
</P>
<P>
When patients are detained longer than is legally permissible, part of the 
reason is concern for the patient and part is concern over a hospital's 
financial liability if the person is released and harms himself or others, 
those familiar with the case say. 
</P>
<P>
Lurie gives this reconstruction of what a hospital's lawyer might say: 
</P>
<P>
"Look at your liability in both directions. Let's say we release this guy and 
he kills five people. We get all the accompanying horrible headlines and then 
we get sued by the families of these people. Then look at the other side -- 
you'd be sued for false imprisonment. And how much is the jury going to award 
for that?" 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Crawford, it was $52,778.02 -- which neither she nor her 
attorney, San Diego lawyer Michael Coleman, will see until the case goes 
through what could be a long appeals process. Crawford could not be reached for 
comment, but her lawyer says she has made it clear she wants to pursue the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going after the money. I'm going after the principle of it," Coleman 
said. "It's frustrating that they still won't acknowledge that they did violate 
the law, and violated this woman's rights." 
</P>
<P>
Under mental health reforms passed in 1969, the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act, 
mentally ill people in California can be held against their wills for 31 days. 
</P>
<P>
This includes 72 hours on an initial emergency hold, followed by two 14-day 
periods that depend entirely on the person meeting specific legal definitions 
of being in grave need of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
During the 31 days, a court can order that a mentally ill person be given a 
conservator authorized for up to a year to consent to treatment for the 
patient. Conservatorships can only be granted for a person the court deems 
unable to provide food, clothing and shelter for himself; being suicidal is not 
included as a reason. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, a hospital will encounter a patient who has no conservator but 
who doctors feel should not leave the hospital, even though the 31-day 
involuntary treatment period has expired. Most commonly, it is because the 
patient is suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't often that someone reaches 31 days without having a conservator, 
though. In San Diego County there were only 16 cases in 1989 of people for whom 
courts authorized involuntary treatment for the full 31-day period. Statewide, 
the number was about 250, out of 90,000 instances a year in which mentally ill 
people are initially held. 
</P>
<P>
But, in such cases, hospitals and patient advocates acknowledge, a hospital may 
opt to keep the person beyond the 31 days and file a writ of habeas corpus on 
the patient's behalf -- asking a judge to tell the hospital whether to release 
the patient. 
</P>
<P>
During trial on the UCSD case, the county's chief patient advocate for the 
mentally ill, Richard Danford, was asked to sanction it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the counsel for the hospital wanted me to say that it's an accepted 
local practice to hold somebody without authority to do that, and then file a 
writ on their behalf. But I refused to say that," Danford recalls. 
</P>
<P>
Still, both Danford and Lurie say these legally questionable holds on patients 
do happen. 
</P>
<P>
"If the facility just can't let the person out on the street, their hands are 
tied, they feel bad about it, this is like a real unusual occurrence and the 
facility really has a record of protecting patients' rights and is trying to 
act in good faith, we won't jump down their throats," Lurie said. "However, if 
we find that this is more or less a pattern then, yes, certainly we'll do 
something about it." 
</P>
<P>
In Crawford's case, she was kept in a locked ward at UCSD Medical Center in 
Hillcrest, first on a 72-hour hold, then under a 14-day authorization. During 
that period, a temporary conservator was appointed until a hearing could be 
held on whether a one-year conservatorship should be granted. 
</P>
<P>
Because Crawford lived in Long Beach before her hospitalization, a court 
hearing on the permanent conservatorship was scheduled in Los Angeles County. 
But Crawford's UCSD doctors believed that she was too ill to go to the hearing 
Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
When she didn't appear for the hearing, the conservatorship proceeding was 
dismissed, and the hospital no longer had any authority to hold her, Coleman 
successfully contended in court. 
</P>
<P>
But the hospital kept Crawford while it filed for a writ of habeas corpus on 
her behalf. Judge J. Perry Langford granted the writ, ordering her release on 
Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
The judge "acknowledged plaintiff's need for hospitalization but lamented the 
lack of any further statutory basis for holding her," UCSD said in its trial 
brief. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman noted that his client returned to Long Beach after being released and 
did not require hospitalization again for about four months. She is now living 
independently, with her daughter as her guardian, in Long Beach, he said. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the six days between the time the conservatorship proceedings 
terminated and the time Langford ordered Crawford's release that she was 
confined illegally and made to take medication that she expressly refused, 
Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
The jury agreed. It named Dr. David Braff, Dr. Eve Dreyfus and the UC Regents 
responsible for assault and battery against her. Only Braff and the regents 
were judged responsible for the false imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's lawyers unsuccessfully contended that Crawford was so ill that she could 
not take care of herself. In addition, they said, hospital officials weren't 
notified of the end of the conservatorship and, in any event, they were immune 
from suit because of the hospital's government ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the verdict is in, the hospital is considering asking Superior Court 
Judge Alpha Montgomery to rule UCSD immune from the suit, order a new trial or 
to overturn the verdict, said attorney Robert Cosgrove. If those avenues fail, 
it might appeal to a higher court, he said. 
</P>
<P>
While Crawford's case appears to be a unique combination of red tape and muffed 
procedural steps, the issues it raises apply more broadly, mental health 
advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
Holding a patient beyond the legally prescribed time will occur most commonly 
with suicidal patients, Danford said. 
</P>
<P>
"The law allows for a suicidal person to be held against their will a grand 
total of 31 days," he said. "At the end of that time the law doesn't say what 
you're supposed to do. So, if you have someone who's on day 31 going to walk 
right out of the hospital and head right for the bridge, you've got a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Alvarado Parkway's Adler has another scenario. 
</P>
<P>
"From now on, when I have a case like this, I'll phone the court and say, 'This 
is my problem. You guys decide what I should do,' " Adler said. 
</P>
<P>
"And, if they tell me to let her go, I will document that in the chart, and I 
will cover myself legally that way. Because, if she leaves and kills her 
next-door neighbor, her next-door neighbor's lawyer, I guarantee you, will sue 
us. And they'll probably win, too." 
</P>
<P>
Danford said he thinks the UCSD case will make hospitals in San Diego, and 
perhaps elsewhere in the state, more cautious. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're going to pay closer attention to those situations where it 
doesn't appear that they have authority to continue to hold somebody -- whereas 
prior to this they might have been more willing to hold them to see what 
happens," Danford said. 
</P>
<P>
George Root, an attorney for many hospitals in the county, as well as for the 
county hospitals association, calls the case an unfortunate precedent. 
</P>
<P>
"The case dealt with the part of the law that there's just simply no answer 
to," Root said. "Most of the facilities in town would have done much the same 
as University did to try to protect the patient." 
</P>
<P>
UCSD spokeswoman Leslie Franz says doctors there are not operating under any 
new policies as a result of the case. They will continue to do what's best for 
patients, she said. 
</P>
<P>
A UC system lawyer, Andrea Resnick, suggested that the solution is for mental 
health law to be changed. The law now gives responsibility for a mentally ill 
person to the person's home county, even if the person is hospitalized 
elsewhere. If Crawford's conservatorship hearing had been in San Diego instead 
of Los Angeles, Resnick said, there wouldn't have been a problem. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, there will still be a few people doctors think belong in the 
hospital but who legally should be released, those involved say. 
</P>
<P>
"You can draw a parallel with the criminal justice system," Lurie muses. 
"Sometimes, criminals who are very dangerous get released on a technicality, 
and you know that they're going to harm somebody else, but the courts have no 
recourse because a law is a law is a law. And the question is, should that 
standard apply to mental health?" 
</P>

BUSH'S ACTION MAY PUT LAGOMARSINO IN HOT WATER; 
</P>
<P>
OFFSHORE: POLITICAL STRATEGISTS SAY THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION ON OIL DRILLING 
HAS ELEVATED THE ENVIRONMENT TO ISSUE STATUS IN THE 19TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
RACE. 
</P>

<P>
President Bush unwittingly ignited a congressional race last week by setting 
the entire California coast off-limits to oil drilling until the next decade 
except areas near the Santa Barbara and Ventura coastlines. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura), who does not oppose offshore drilling, 
said the President's decision realized his worst fears by concentrating all of 
California's offshore oil exploration within his congressional district. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino's Democratic challenger, Anita Perez Ferguson, wasted no time in 
trying to pin the blame on the 16-year incumbent who has never joined the rest 
of the state congressional delegation in seeking a statewide moratorium on 
offshore leasing to oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been the odd man out on this one," Ferguson said. "Lagomarsino just sat 
there and watched the whole thing go by. He didn't protect us when we needed 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Although Lagomarsino fiercely defends his environmental record, most political 
strategists agree that Bush has handed Ferguson a potent campaign issue in a 
coastal area that is increasingly concerned about the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"It is one of the top issues in the race and it can be used effectively against 
him," said Howard Schloss, a spokesman with the Democratic Congressional 
Campaign Committee, a fund-raising and strategy office that helps elect 
Democrats to the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Koops of the GOP's counterpart office, the National Republican 
Congressional Committee, said he does not yet view Lagomarsino in "political 
danger" over this issue. "Certainly, we will keep an eye on that district, 
given the kind of race he has had." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Lagomarsino squeaked by in one of the toughest and most expensive 
congressional races in the nation. He defeated his challenger, state Sen. Gary 
K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), by fewer than 4,000 votes in the 19th Congressional 
District, which includes Santa Barbara County and the northwestern portion of 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, a former aide to Hart, was widely believed by leaders of both parties 
to be holding a place in this election season for her former boss, a popular 
politician. 
</P>
<P>
But recent events have strengthened her chances, including having a woman, 
Dianne Feinstein, head the Democratic ticket in the race for governor. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions that have made abortion 
rights advocates more politically active could win more votes for Ferguson, who 
favors a woman's right to an abortion. Lagomarsino opposes abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Also, pollsters say incumbents across the country are measuring lower 
favorability ratings than they have had in decades. Polls show that the reduced 
communist threat makes some voters focus more sharply on quality-of-life issues 
such as education and the environment. Democrats traditionally score higher in 
polls than Republicans in handling these issues. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, President Bush elevated the environment to issue status in the area 
by announcing his long-awaited decision on the future of oil drilling in 
federal waters, which begin three miles off the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
The President banned new oil leases off 99% of the coast until the year 2000. 
But he excluded 87 tracts in the Santa Barbara Channel and the Santa Maria 
Basin because of their high potential for oil exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said these tracts, situated off the Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis 
Obispo county coastlines, would be available for leasing in 1996, provided that 
drilling could be done in an environmentally safe manner. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino said the decision left him feeling "a little bit" forsaken by the 
leader of his party. "I can understand why he did it. It is easy politically. 
Most other areas don't care as long as it doesn't affect them." 
</P>
<P>
At a White House barbecue held the same day as the announcement, Lagomarsino 
said he had a brief opportunity to express his displeasure to the President. "I 
told him it was unfair," Lagomarsino said. "Why should they pick on one area? 
If they want to go ahead with oil drilling there are plenty of places along the 
coast." 
</P>
<P>
The congressman said Bush appeared surprised he wasn't happy with the outcome. 
"My impression is that he thought everybody would be pleased with it." 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino has been one of the few coastal members of the California 
delegation who has not joined the annual rite in Congress of placing a yearlong 
moratorium on all leasing off the state's coastline. The ritual, repeated every 
year, began in the early 1980s after former Department of the Interior 
Secretary James Watt tried to open the whole coastline for offshore oil 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino said he considers it irresponsible to oppose all offshore oil 
drilling while the nation is importing more than 50% of its oil. But he said 
the burden should be spread around, not be focused solely on his district. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not necessarily against it, if it is in the right place and you have the 
proper safeguards and the air quality is taken care of," he said. "There are 
far greater safety hazards with tankers than drilling for oil and bringing it 
ashore with a pipeline." 
</P>
<P>
If elected, Ferguson said she would join other California Democrats in pushing 
for a permanent ban on oil drilling off the state's coast. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino, she said, has failed to protect his area of the coastline even 
though he claims to have the President's ear and is one of the ranking members 
of the House Interior Committee, which oversees offshore drilling. 
</P>
<P>
"He has tried to cultivate this environmental image," Ferguson said. "But when 
you look at his voting record, it doesn't really measure up." She cites various 
poor ratings from environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for instance, the League of Conservation Voters gave Lagomarsino a 
50% rating on what its coalition of environmental groups considered key votes. 
"We are happy that he has gone up from 38%, but 50% is still a failing grade," 
said Bennett Hinkley, a league spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Lagomarsino dismisses environmental ratings as political tools of the 
Democratic Party. As for the offshore oil debate, he cites three significant 
accomplishments in protecting this section of the coastline. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Congress approved his bill to turn the Channel Islands into a national 
park. Earlier this year, he persuaded oil companies to divert their tankers 
outside the Channel Islands as a precaution against spills such as those that 
occurred off Alaska and Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Last month he joined with two other California congressmen to amend the House 
version of the Clean Air Act so offshore oil rigs would have to comply with 
stricter air pollution standards enforced by the Environmental Protection 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never heard of anything that she has done," Lagomarsino said of his 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club and some state Democratic leaders have accused President Bush 
of timing and shaping the offshore oil announcement to help Republican Sen. 
Pete Wilson in his gubernatorial race against Feinstein, a Democrat and former 
mayor of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, a longtime foe of offshore drilling, has urged Bush to postpone all new 
leasing. "We have worked real hard to give the President the information to 
compel another look at the drilling program," said Otto Bos, Wilson's top 
campaign strategist. 
</P>
<P>
But just as the Republican White House's plan to protect 99% of the coast might 
help Wilson, the decision to leave open 1% could hurt Lagomarsino, said John 
Davies, a political consultant in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Club is considering endorsing Ferguson, and Bob Hattoy, the group's 
regional director in Los Angeles, said he expects an election issue to emerge 
from Bush turning the Santa Barbara Channel into a "national sacrifice area." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is fair to ask the question, 'Why is it that despite a 99% ban, the 
1% that is being drilled is in Lagomarsino's district?' " Hattoy said. "I've 
sat in many conference rooms where those who didn't object got drilling." 
</P>
<P>
One reason cited for singling out the Ventura and Santa Barbara coastlines is 
that these areas have more offshore rigs than anywhere else in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara County residents have been more vocal in objecting to drilling 
than those in Ventura County. "Oil drilling is just not compatible with the 
lifestyle of the central coast," Hattoy said. 
</P>
<P>
But demographics are changing in Ventura County, which 40 years ago was ruled 
by the oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
In the '40s and '50s, a majority of county residents had some connection to the 
oil industry. Last year, state statistics showed only 2,400 residents worked 
for firms extracting or producing gas, oil or other minerals. 
</P>
<P>
Big oil's political visibility has further diminished in recent years. In 1986, 
the industry organized a rally with 4,000 workers in Ventura County to greet 
Donald P. Hodel, then the secretary of the interior, on a statewide tour of 
prospective offshore oil fields. 
</P>
<P>
But last week, the President's decision to postpone leasing on 99% of these 
same tracts was met with near resignation by the industry. 
</P>
<P>
"The surprise was the extent of the ban," said Terry Covington, executive 
director of the California Coastal Operators Group, an industry association 
representing nine major oil companies from San Luis Obispo to Ventura County. 
"The industry overall is disappointed in how much land has been put out of 
reach." 
</P>
<P>
Ed Bedwell, a former Lagomarsino campaign manager who prides himself on being 
able to measure the pulse of the district, senses a "changing political climate 
in Ventura County." In the past year, he said, slow-growth candidates have won 
elections across the county with environmental messages.

SHOULD POUND ANIMALS BE USED FOR RESEARCH?;

COUNTIES HAVE BANNED THEIR LABORATORY USE.

<P>
Almost a quarter-century ago, the county of San Diego signed a contract with UC 
San Diego that is protested to this day. In 1967, shortly after UCSD opened its 
School of Medicine, the county agreed to sell university shelter animals for 
research. The pound seizure contract was quietly affirmed, then renewed over 
the years, and nothing more was heard of it until 1981. 
</P>
<P>
By then, opposition to pets in labs had arisen from animal lovers, humane 
societies, animal rights groups, professional shelter personnel, and even from 
researchers themselves. As early as 1972, Dr. Thomas Bowery, a director of the 
tax-funded National Institutes of Health, largest research institution in the 
world, testified before Congress that the house pet "is not a good or desirable 
research animal." Today, thousands of physicians and scientists agree with him. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the Humane Society of the United States polled 2,200 shelters 
nationwide, asking "Do you believe that release of animals for research 
undermines effective animal control programs and pet owner confidence in your 
shelter?" Ninety-three percent of those responding answered affirmatively. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, with a backdrop of growing opposition, the Board of Supervisors 
reluctantly held its one and only public hearing on the pet sales contract. 
When it became obvious to the several hundred citizens there in opposition that 
the county intended to continue the contract, their frustration burst into an 
angry verbal donnybrook. The contract was renewed. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors continued to accommodate UCSD and the "research" 
performed there on random pound animals whose genetic and health histories were 
unknown, even though many serious researchers considered the use of these 
animals bad science. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the pound seizure controversy is not a pro- or anti-research issue 
at all. It addresses only the source of the animals -- shelter pets -- and the 
undermining of a public shelter system that depends on people's trust for its 
very survival. 
</P>
<P>
Many people instinctively feel, and rightly, that humane shelters must not act 
as warehouses for research laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
If shelters are not seen by the public as safe havens for pets rather than a 
stop on the way to the lab, unwanted and stray pets will be abandoned to the 
streets, thereby increasing the already staggering pet overpopulation. UCSD 
does not have to worry about the added cost of rounding up those stray animals, 
however. The Board of Supervisors sends the tab to us taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Today it is clear that the county is swimming upstream on the pet seizure 
issue. Fifty-four of California's 58 counties ban it, as do 14 states and 
thousands of municipalities across the land. 
</P>
<P>
After S.T.O.P., or Stop Taking Our Pets, was formed in 1987, we soon found that 
we would be unable to influence the county. We directed our efforts at the 
cities that contract with the county for animal control services. 
</P>
<P>
We found much opposition to pound seizure in the city councils and resentment 
at having to participate in the county's side contract with UCSD, whether they 
liked it or not. 
</P>
<P>
This year, during the current contract renewal hearings, the county Animal 
Control Department is openly threatening contract cities with loss of service 
should they enact ordinances prohibiting pet sales to UCSD. (There were about 
530 last year.) Why is the county willing to jeopardize $2.1 million in annual 
revenues from city animal-control contracts to preserve a $38,000 yearly 
agreement with UCSD? 
</P>
<P>
So far, the threats have been effective. The cities have nowhere else to go for 
this essential service and can't afford to start their own programs. But sooner 
or later a city will refuse to be intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen whether the Board of Supervisors can legally withdraw a 
state-mandated service when it does not get its way. The Del Mar City Council 
is scheduled to debate the issue tomorrow night. UCSD and other pound seizure 
champions like to say that shelter animals "will die anyway," so why not use 
them? 
</P>
<P>
Take a good, long look at your beloved pet. It's no different from one on the 
pound's "research row." Which would you choose for him or her -- painless 
euthanasia or the stress, pain and unknown of the researcher's table? And there 
is pain. In some research, pain measurement is the experiment. 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure you made the humane choice. Now write the Board of Supervisors.

TRUCK ACCIDENT ROUSES CRITICS OF HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT; 
</P>
<P>
CONSTRUCTION: STUDIO CITY RIDGE HOMEOWNERS COMPLAIN THAT THE ROADS ARE TOO 
NARROW AND WEAK TO SUPPORT THE CURRENT BUILDING BOOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
To homeowners on Avenida del Sol, a serpentine street in the hills of Studio 
City, an accident last week in which a 30-ton concrete truck rolled off the 
edge of the road and onto a house below was frightening but not surprising. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been seeing this for a year and a half," resident Chip Worsinger said of 
the heavy construction traffic on his narrow hillside street. Last week's 
mishap was the most serious accident, but not the only one, involving 
construction vehicles on the road since a wave of building began two years ago, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of Avenida del Sol said Monday's accident proves that their street, 
built by a developer in the 1920s, is neither wide enough nor strong enough to 
support the large number of heavy trucks and other construction vehicles that 
have come with the recent building boom. 
</P>
<P>
Crowding on the 1.5-mile semicircular road will continue even when the 
construction stops, they charge, because developers are building houses so 
close to the edge of the pavement that future occupants will have no choice but 
to park their cars on the street. 
</P>
<P>
To the developers and contractors building high-priced houses on Avenida del 
Sol, the residents' anger is understandable but misplaced. Tom Posey, the 
general contractor to whom the truck was delivering concrete when the street 
collapsed under it, said he has addressed homeowners' complaints by removing 
his equipment from the street. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he has positioned the houses he is building so that they will have 
adequate off-street parking. 
</P>
<P>
"We've complied about as much as we can," Posey said. "They're being 
unreasonable with us. They just don't want to see development." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Michael Woo on Tuesday ordered an investigation of the cause of 
the truck accident. He said Friday that the city engineer had asked the 
Building and Safety Department to order Posey to stop construction work near 
the site of the mishap until the road is properly reinforced. The department is 
to issue the order early next week, Woo said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say that similar debates over hillside development are occurring 
throughout Los Angeles. The crux of the problem, said Woo aide Diana 
Brueggemann, is that construction is occurring "on sites that previously people 
thought were unbuildable." 
</P>
<P>
Many streets in the city's hills are narrow and steep, built when the areas 
were only sparsely populated, and are inadequate for carrying heavy traffic. In 
addition, Brueggemann said, the high cost of construction on steep hillsides 
encourages developers to build large houses that they can sell at high profits. 
</P>
<P>
Worsinger, president of the Hillside Homeowners Coalition, formed last year in 
response to residents' anger over congestion caused by construction traffic, 
said he worries that rescue vehicles would be unable to reach accident victims 
during an emergency. He said that on several occasions postal carriers have 
been unable to make deliveries because trucks have blocked the road. In 
addition, he said, parked cars have been damaged by construction materials that 
fall from passing trucks. 
</P>
<P>
The one point on which residents and builders seem to agree is that the city is 
not doing enough to regulate construction on steep hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
"Building and Safety should require developers to clear out land for parking," 
said Sion Shabo, a developer building two houses on Avenida del Sol. 
</P>
<P>
To residents' accusations that developers are building houses too close to the 
narrow streets, Posey responded, "They're not building any closer than 
anybody's letting them." 
</P>
<P>
"It's a disastrous situation up here that's not being acknowledged by city 
officials,' Worsinger said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's current general plan requires roads in hillside residential areas to 
be at least 28 feet wide and buildings to be at least four feet from the side 
of the road, Los Angeles Senior City Engineer Charles Jack said. But the 
requirement is unenforceable on Avenida del Sol because the road was built by a 
private developer and is still maintained by its residents, rather than by the 
city, he said. "The law doesn't give us any power to require anything," Jack 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Woo, whose district includes Avenida del Sol, said he is trying to strengthen 
hillside construction regulations. An ordinance he introduced to coordinate 
city departments' responses to complaints about construction site abuses and 
building code violations will go before the full council later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
He also has proposed a measure limiting the size and density of hillside houses 
and requiring off-street parking and minimum setbacks. That ordinance was 
introduced last year and still must go before the city Planning Commission.

State transportation officials are asking commuters who use California 118 
between Simi Valley and Moorpark to be patient the next several weeks as 
workers repave a section of the road. 
</P>
<P>
The $400,000 improvement project, which began last week, covers a half-mile 
section between Alamos Canyon Road and the Simi Valley Landfill, Caltrans 
engineer Robert Joe said. 
</P>
<P>
Moisture in the soil under the roadway has caused the pavement to bow and 
crack, Joe said. 
</P>
<P>
Only one lane of the four-lane highway will be closed at a time during the 
construction period, Joe said. The work is scheduled to be completed by Aug.

LAW ENFORCEMENT: FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS, SCOFFLAWS IN AVALON MAY BE LITERALLY 
CARTED OFF TO JAIL. SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES WILL TEST WHETHER A CUSTOMIZED GOLF 
VEHICLE SHOULD BE PERMANENTLY ADDED TO THEIR CRIME-FIGHTING ARSENAL.

<P>
It may not stir fear in the hearts of the bad guys, but Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's deputies on Santa Catalina Island swear by their newest anti-crime 
weapon: a golf cart. 
</P>
<P>
Decked out with flashing lights, a shotgun rack, high-speed transmission and 
radio equipment, the formidable Yamaha Sun Classic is probably the fastest cart 
on the island, said Lt. Tom Gahry, manager of the sheriff's Avalon station. 
</P>
<P>
The nine-foot-long cruiser, complete with a slick black-and-white paint job, 
was clocked at a top speed of 31 m.p.h. during its first day in service last 
week, Gahry said. 
</P>
<P>
But when you're pursuing someone in a 1.2-square-mile town on an island with a 
handful of roads and where the number of cars is restricted, speed isn't 
necessarily a critical element. "Where are they going to go?" Gahry asked. 
"We'll get them eventually." 
</P>
<P>
Maneuverability, however, can be a big plus. 
</P>
<P>
And the cart is great for navigating the narrow alleyways of Avalon, as well as 
threading through the packed crowds of the town's main drag, said Sgt. Bob 
Wachsmuth, who last week took the two-seater cart for a spin on his patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best thing about the cart is its price: free. 
</P>
<P>
Catalina Yamaha has loaned the vehicle to the Avalon sheriff's station for a 
six-month trial period. The company hopes that if the cart proves a successful 
crime buster, the Sheriff's Department will buy a number of the vehicles for 
their mainland operations, said John Regalado, service manager of the island's 
Yamaha dealership. 
</P>
<P>
Without all the police gadgets, the cart sells for about $8,000, Regalado said. 
The equipment and installation adds $4,000 to the price tag, police estimated. 
</P>
<P>
Even townspeople and tourists are enjoying Avalon's latest attraction. "The 
vehicle warms up our image a little and it's in keeping with the ambience of 
the island and its tourism," said Gahry, who dresses in shorts and a polo shirt 
while on duty. 
</P>
<P>
Kaya Brand, who was vacationing on Catalina far from his home in Switzerland, 
stared incredulously as he spied the cart last week. "It doesn't look serious, 
but I like it. It's cool."

SCHOOLS GO YEAR-ROUND TO EASE CROWDING; 
</P>
<P>
VISTA BECOMES COUNTY'S LARGEST DISTRICT TO USE NEW CALENDAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"Open house in July, what a thought," said Vista schools Supt. Rene Townsend as 
elementary and middle schools gear up for their first year on a year-round 
schedule and parent nights in the middle of summer. 
</P>
<P>
The trend toward year-round education in San Diego County schools takes a giant 
leap forward Monday when the 11 elementary and three middle schools in the 
Vista Unified School District all move to a year-round schedule, the largest 
San Diego County school district to make such a move. 
</P>
<P>
But an administrator from Escondido Union School District, the first and only 
other school district in California to have had all of its schools go on a 
year-round schedule, warns there are dangers ahead for those attempting to 
install that timetable districtwide. 
</P>
<P>
"Unless you absolutely have to, you should always have a certain number of 
schools on a traditional schedule, geographically placed so that parents would 
have a choice of transferring their children from a year-round school," said 
Elmer Cameron, retired associate superintendent for the Escondido district. He 
oversaw the administration of districtwide year-round education. 
</P>
<P>
Escondido Union put all of its 13 elementary and middle schools on a year-round 
schedule in 1975 after having piloted the program for three years. Six years 
later, amid parent and teacher unhappiness over not having a choice of 
schedules, the district returned to a traditional schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Vista Unified's move to year-round schools, together with six schools in South 
Bay and Cajon Valley school districts, brings to 112 the number of year-round 
schools in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Year-round education eases overcrowding by putting students and teachers in the 
same school on different calendars, in effect having more than one school on 
campus at a time. 
</P>
<P>
Vista's plan, for example, uses a three-track system in which three sets of 
students will go to class for two months and then have a one month vacation, 
each set of students alternating vacation months. One-third of the students are 
on vacation at any given time, thus increasing the capacity of the school by 
half. 
</P>
<P>
Year-round schools were first introduced to the county in 1971 when six 
year-round schools sprung up in the Chula Vista and La Mesa-Spring Valley 
school districts in response to a boom in population. Since then, new schools 
have been built and growth rates in those two school districts have eased, yet 
several schools opted to remain on a year-round, single-track schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Vista Unified schools undergoing a similar space crunch are already flooded 
with more than 300 relocatable classrooms, and some elementary schools are so 
crowded they have gone as far as installing portable restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
"I would visit schools where what used to be playground space is no longer 
playground space, there's a relocatable there," said Ron Riedberger, Vista 
Unified assistant superintendent in charge of coordinating the switch to 
year-round education. 
</P>
<P>
"Stop and think about a campus built for 600 kids, and now there's 1,000 kids 
there," Riedberger said. "What does that do to the cafeteria, what does that do 
to restroom facilities?" 
</P>
<P>
"I have heard many parents say they really don't think year-round is a great 
solution, but they also realize we don't have any other options," Riedberger 
said. "Our hands are tied." 
</P>
<P>
Riedberger concedes, however, that not all the schools in the district are 
overcrowded enough to warrant going to a year-round schedule, and there is hope 
that a new elementary school will be built in the district sometime in the next 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
Riedberger said the districtwide implementation of year-round scheduling is an 
effort to treat schools in the district equitably. 
</P>
<P>
"Year-round has been implemented in a lot of school districts because of 
overcrowding. And where has the overcrowding been taking place? Especially in 
districts such as Los Angeles and San Diego. It's taken place in those areas 
that (have) predominantly minority enrollments," Riedberger said. 
</P>
<P>
"So minority populations have said, 'You're picking on us.' . . . What's 
interesting is that in some of the other school districts, it was the more 
affluent people saying, 'Why can't we have year-round, we think it's a good 
thing.' " 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some schools that originally implemented year-round education in 
response to overcrowded schools have decided to keep the system even after the 
crisis had passed. 
</P>
<P>
"We found that most of our families enjoyed (the year-round schedule)," said 
John Vugrin, superintendent of Chula Vista city schools where nine schools have 
opted to remain on a single-track year-round schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents felt that the motivation of their children was increased and they 
enjoyed the variants in terms of vacation times other than summers," Vugrin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some Vista parents, although they don't like the idea of going to year-round, 
are resigned to the idea that this is what they have to do. 
</P>
<P>
"It's inevitable, particularly considering what's going on in this district," 
said Rich Beadle, a Vista parent who worked on the development of the 
year-round program on the parents' subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not pleased with the particular format that the district chose here, in 
particular this (calendar) which offers our children the minimum number of 
school days mandated by the state," said Beadle, whose son is a fourth-grader 
at Beaumont Elementary School. "I'd like to get as close to the maximum if we 
could." 
</P>
<P>
Beadle said parents were also concerned that all the tracks have equal access 
to special programs, such as those for the academically gifted and those 
needing bilingual services. So far, the district has agreed to provide a gifted 
program but is still debating whether bilingual services will be available on 
all three tracks. 
</P>
<P>
The new schedule's effect on day care and after-school activities that normally 
occur during the summer also concerned parents who now need to find activities 
for their children every third month, as opposed to three months in summer, 
Beadle said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this year it's going to be a lot of testing, and we're just going to 
have to find out what works and what doesn't work. If the community stays 
involved in it, I think it's going to work out," Beadle said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the district has responded well where they could, but I felt in some 
instances (the parents') participation was tolerated but not exactly welcomed," 
Beadle said. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers who are more than fed up with overcrowding have resigned themselves to 
the year-round plan, and are pleased that something is being done. 
</P>
<P>
"The year-round calendar will be a great help in the classroom in terms of 
giving the teachers really distinct blocks of teaching time and then having 
them become refreshed and rejuvenated to analyze things they've done (during 
the frequent breaks)," said Tamara Drean, president of the Vista Teacher's 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to allow for a higher level of intensity for teachers after eight 
weeks to sit back and reflect on what they've done," Drean said. 
</P>
<P>
But Drean also expressed concerns over teachers having to share classrooms and 
space, saying many teachers use instructional tools not easily moved from one 
classroom to another. Some of those tools, such as science equipment and nature 
displays, may not be used because of the effort needed to move them, Drean 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of year-round education, where vacations are spread out over the 
year instead of concentrated in the summer, say students are fresher, they 
retain more of their learning than they do with a three-month summer layoff, 
and that teachers keep better track of their students' progress. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids right now go to school when we tell them to on a traditional calendar. 
All of the concerns that we have are adult concerns, not child or student 
concerns," said Charles Ballinger, executive director of the National Assn. for 
Year-Round Education and coordinator of year-round education for the San Diego 
County Office of Education. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know of any schools whose scores have gone down because of year-round 
education," Ballinger said. 
</P>
<P>
Ballinger feels that year-round education makes better use of school facilities 
and, because of the shorter but more frequent breaks, students and teachers 
attend school at higher rates. The students' learning loss over the three 
months of summertime is lessened by the shorter breaks, Ballinger said. 
</P>
<P>
Ballinger admits, however, that year-round education demands more 
organizational skill on the part of the administration and places 
inconveniences on teachers who sometimes must share classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
The three-track system that Vista Unified plans to use fits more students into 
the schools, but it lengthens school days by 35 minutes. It also limits the 
schools' ability to lengthen the school year in the future, said Warren 
Hogarth, superintendent of the La Mesa-Spring Valley School District. 
</P>
<P>
Moving to a multitrack year-round schedule allows Vista Unified to put off 
building new schools for up to six years, Riedberger said, although some 
speculate that the shift gives Vista as little as two years of breathing room. 
</P>
<P>
Another of the advantages to year-round has been to give schools time to 
determine whether or not building a new school is even necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"We find that growth cycles are seven to nine years long, and then there's a 
decline in enrollment," Ballinger said. "Therefore the popular question is one 
of do we build schools on a straight line projection, or do we build to the 
nine-year cycle and use the current capacity to its fullest." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm almost positive that Vista will follow the usual cycle of growth," 
Ballinger said. 
</P>
<P>
La Mesa-Spring Valley School District was able to forgo unnecessarily building 
new schools in the 1970s after it went on a year-round schedule. An enrollment 
decline several years later forced the district to sell two schools over the 
next 10 years, and now it is again experiencing increased numbers of students. 
</P>
<P>
"To build too many schools at peak period of enrollments I don't think is wise 
until you see a concrete enrollment over a long period of time," Hogarth said. 
</P>
<P>
Hogarth said the district saved millions of dollars by going on the year-round 
schedule and not building new schools. 
</P>
<P>
But while deferring the construction of new schools saves the state and 
district money, year-round education also has its costs. 
</P>
<P>
Teachers, administrators and support staff generally have to be paid more for 
working a longer year, and utilities costs for keeping school buildings open 
all year also increase. 
</P>
<P>
In Vista Unified, some schools face the added problem of the sweltering summer 
heat, since only four of the 11 elementary schools in the district have air 
conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the schools can be very, very uncomfortable," Riedberger said. "The 
state says, 'Yes, we have money for air conditioning,' but we haven't seen any 
of it."

ARSONIST STRIKES AGAIN AT LANCASTER SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second time in a week, a fire was set Saturday afternoon at a Lancaster 
junior high school, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
An arsonist set a fire at the Parkview Middle School at the corner of Avenue J 
and Fig Avenue, Lt. Dan Reidder of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze, to which firefighters were sent at 4:50 p.m., caused $150,000 in 
property damage. No people were in the school during the fire and nobody was 
injured, Reidder said. 
</P>
<P>
An arsonist set fire to the Monte Vista Junior High School in Lancaster July 
23. Police are investigating the possibility that the same person set the two 
fires, Reidder said.

LAKE HENSHAW FIRE CLOSER TO CONTAINMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Firefighters reported progress Saturday in their battle to extinguish the huge 
arson fire that has consumed some 3,650 acres of desert, chaparral and other 
brush in the rural Lake Henshaw area of Northern San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
The blaze, known as the Morettis Fire after the small community near where it 
began, has been the largest to date during the county's brush-fire season. 
</P>
<P>
The intense blaze, which began at 2:15 p.m. Thursday, was expected to be 
contained by 7 a.m. today, said Audrey Hagen, a spokeswoman for the California 
Department of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
Containment means that firefighters have established a line around the blaze. 
The fire is not expected to be extinguished until Monday morning, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The only injuries reported thus far were 10 firefighters who suffered minor 
ailments such as smoke inhalation, various cuts, a dislocated shoulder and a 
broken finger, Hagen said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, 1,827 firefighters from throughout the area were attempting to 
extinguish the blaze, she said. 
</P>
<P>
No homes have been destroyed, although six structures -- sheds, bunkhouses and 
the like -- have burned, Hagen said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, residents of 20 homes in the nearby rural community of San 
Felipe were temporarily evacuated as a precaution. They later returned home on 
a standby basis. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have said that the fire was set deliberately, but no suspects have 
been named.

'CREDIT CRUNCH' FEARS GROWING; 
</P>
<P>
FINANCE: DESPITE FEDERAL ASSURANCES, TALES OF TIGHT MONEY HAVE EXPERTS 
CONCERNED THAT THE ECONOMY COULD BE PUSHED INTO A RECESSION. 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SPRINGFIELD, Vt. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Factory owner Craig Barrett says he had been faithfully meeting his payments on 
the $907,000 line of credit that he has had since 1988, so he was taken aback 
earlier this year when the Vermont Federal Bank abruptly called in his loan. 
</P>
<P>
Worse yet, Barrett says, the institution also froze his company's money-market 
account containing $133,000. Forced to order layoffs, Barrett eventually filed 
for bankruptcy -- "to protect my company, machinery and equipment." The case is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
"We are one of the victims of the nationwide credit crunch," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett is not alone in his perception that America is in the throes of a 
serious credit squeeze. All over New England -- and in other regions, from the 
Rust Belt to the Southwest -- business people are complaining that banks have 
begun to tighten the screws. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the perception is so widespread that some analysts fear the already 
weak economy could be pushed into a recession. Commerce Secretary Robert A. 
Mosbacher warned that the crunch is "serious, and . . . appears to be 
exacerbating." 
</P>
<P>
Federal regulators deny that there is any sort of across-the-board credit 
crunch or that legitimate crackdowns on some especially risky types of lending 
pose a threat of recession. And they cite recent studies that appear to support 
their claims. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, concern in the business community is widespread. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Barrett insists that his company will survive -- the speeded-up 
bankruptcy proceedings are to be completed as early as next month, he asserts 
-- but he maintains that Vermont Federal's decision to dun him was unnecessary 
and possibly even unfair. 
</P>
<P>
As usual in such instances, the bank refuses to comment. "That case is still in 
litigation," John Cobb, president of Eastern Bancorp, the holding company that 
owns Vermont Federal, says. But he asserts that Barrett's allegations are "not 
the facts in the case." 
</P>
<P>
Ostensibly, the credit crackdown is in reaction to the savings and loan 
scandal. Wary of seeing banks fall into the same bind as S&amp;Ls, federal 
banking regulators formally cautioned bankers to avoid making dubious loans and 
to tighten requirements for collateral. 
</P>
<P>
They also ordered the institutions to rebuild their capital reserves -- which 
had ebbed to an uncomfortably low level over the past few years -- as a hedge 
against soured ventures. New international lending safeguards call for higher 
capital requirements. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, banks -- and most other financial institutions -- have virtually 
stopped making loans in sectors that have proved risky for the S&amp;Ls, such 
as commercial real estate, leveraged buyouts and the like. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a tremendous reduction in the availability of funds to finance 
mergers and acquisitions," says Lyle Gramley, a former Fed governor and now 
chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Assn. Gramley says little of that has 
affected small business and housing. 
</P>
<P>
But critics of the industry charge that the bankers have overreacted, calling 
in "good" loans -- presumably like Barrett's -- along with the bad. And some 
suspect that the banks are using the federal warning as an excuse to weed out 
questionable loans that have begun to go bad. 
</P>
<P>
"The banks have certainly scapegoated the Comptroller of the Currency (one of 
the four major federal bank regulatory agencies) more than is deserved," a 
senior government official asserts. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is, apart from "anecdotal" complaints, such as Barrett's, neither 
federal authorities nor private economists can find any hard evidence that 
there really is a serious credit crunch across the nation -- or that it is 
pushing the economy into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide credit figures collected by the Federal Reserve Board and surveys by 
private industry groups show that, at worst, the "crunch" is limited, confined 
mainly to New England and a few visible problem sectors. 
</P>
<P>
And a fresh survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston -- published last 
Thursday -- showed that, even in New England, virtually all of a reported 
decline in lending figures for the first quarter reflects writeoffs or sales of 
old loans, not any cut in overall lending. 
</P>
<P>
"The actual availability of bank credit regionwide did not change significantly 
over the first quarter," says Richard Kopcke, the bank's vice president and 
chief economist, who compiled the figures. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, sounded a similar note, telling the Senate 
Banking Committee earlier this month that, while lenders "have tightened their 
standards in certain sectors and locales, . . . there has not been a 
broad-based squeeze." 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan also denied that the tightening that has occurred so far has been 
enough to push the economy into a recession. "Access to credit has not been 
reduced to an extent that has had a significant damping influence on the 
American economy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
David D. Hale, economist for Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, agrees. "To 
the extent that we depend heavily on small business for job creation in the 
economy, this may retard job growth, but it won't stop it," Hale says. "On the 
margin, some businesses are suffering." 
</P>
<P>
That hasn't prevented the businesses that are "on the margin" from complaining 
-- or from sounding a call for help from Congress. The Senate Banking Committee 
hearing was filled with dire warnings from lawmakers admonishing the regulators 
not to go overboard. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been barraged with letters and calls . . . mainly from real estate 
developers," Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.) told the regulators. "The people making 
these claims are not unreasonable people," Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D-Md.) said. 
</P>
<P>
But some analysts contend that not all the complaints are as serious as 
lawmakers make them out to be. "You hear some pretty grim stories, but when you 
follow up you hear they're not as bad as you would think from listening," 
asserts Gramley of the Mortgage Bankers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Murray Gerber, a Middletown, Conn., plastics maker, says his 100-worker plant 
has been enjoying the best five months in its 22 years of operation -- after an 
improvement in 1989. "Knock on plastic; I'm very happy," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Gerber says he has encountered visible resistance from bank loan officers 
on his plans to draw anew -- as he does each summer -- on part of a $200,000 
line of credit that he took out at Connecticut National Bank a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't actually refused me, but I get this attitude: 'We'd like you not 
to take the equipment loan this year,' " Gerber reports. He is working around 
that, but "it's a bit frustrating," he says. "They're painting us with the same 
brush." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Blair, director of the Massachusetts Industrial Finance Agency, a 
private-sector group, says there are hundreds of other such cases, but business 
people are reluctant to speak about them publicly because of the stigma 
involved in being refused a loan. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the part that Mr. Greenspan's numbers are missing," he says. 
</P>
<P>
There's no real question that bank regulators have been pressuring the industry 
to trim its sails a bit. Many analysts believe that the nation's financial 
system already is fragile as a result of the S&amp;L scandal -- and unusually 
vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
The Comptroller's office formally warned banks early this year to exercise more 
prudence in lending to "problem" sectors. And reports from areas such as New 
England and Texas indicate that bank examiners are a lot fussier these days -- 
and more ready to challenge dubious loans. 
</P>
<P>
The question is, have the regulators -- and the banks -- overdone it? Earlier 
this year, the Fed sought to quash the issue by inviting key bankers to 
Washington so the regulators could set the record straight on just how severe 
any cutbacks should be. Presumably, most got the word. 
</P>
<P>
Greenspan appears satisfied, for the moment, that the scare has been blunted in 
time -- though he and other regulators left no doubt that there still are some 
areas where a sharper crackdown is justified. 
</P>
<P>
"In our view, banks are to be applauded for tightening lending standards," 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. William L. Seidman told Congress in a 
statement. "Applying traditional prudent lending standards to this kind of 
borrower is a sound practice." 
</P>
<P>
But the jury still is out, and -- for better or worse -- the industry appears 
likely to be more "prudent" at least for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to respond to what we read is going on," says Eastern Bancorp's 
John Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not aggressively seeking new business. We are working with our existing 
customers to make sure that all the documentation is proper. And there are 
types of things we're not looking at -- speculative loans, commercial real 
estate -- until we see what the Fed is up to. 
</P>
<P>
But Cobb vehemently denies that his institution is overreacting on any loan. 
"Banks make money by lending money," he says, "and we wouldn't be arbitrarily 
cutting back on any good customer. There are two sides to every story." 
</P>
<P>
Still, even Greenspan concedes that the danger is not over and that the banks' 
new caution could get out of hand, as it did in 1980, when the Carter 
Administration coaxed the central bank into scaring consumers out of spending. 
It did, and the country plunged into a slump.

Despite the regulators' attempt to ward off a scare, "significant problems 
cannot be ruled out in the period ahead, and we will continue to devote close 
attention to credit conditions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Translated from the Fed jargon, that means simply: Watch this space. 
Springfield's Barrett may not have much company now, but when the 
second-quarter figures come in, they could well show that he is far from alone.

JAMES FLANIGAN: OF ALL PEOPLE, BUSH DRIVES STAKE THROUGH HEART OF REAGANOMICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush is reversing Reaganomics. Bush's statement last week that "tax 
revenue increases" will be needed to cut the budget deficit signals a return to 
the way things were before the 1986 tax reform lowered income tax rates, 
reduced the number of tax brackets and got more people to pay. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, the tax system will go back to more graduated brackets, with an 
offsetting increase in deductions, and capital gains will be taxed at a lower 
rate than ordinary income. Tax shelters will make a comeback, and new tax 
wrinkles will appear. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, nothing so dramatic was announced last week; the President merely 
conceded that more taxes would be needed to reach a budget agreement. 
</P>
<P>
But Bush also said he wants "entitlement reform" and "growth incentives." 
Translated into plain English -- "read my lips" -- that means new taxes on 
Social Security benefits and a differential rate for capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there will be months of political argument before such tax changes are 
imposed. But keep in mind that both parties want to change the tax system -- 
Bush's statement was drafted by both Democrats and Republicans, working over 
breakfast in the White House. You will be paying more taxes next year. 
</P>
<P>
Why is this happening? Because a slow economy made a mockery of the 
Administration's economic assumptions. Tax returns brought in $20 billion less 
than anticipated, and high interest rates cost the government at least $30 
billion more than planned in payments on the national debt. Budget chaos 
loomed. 
</P>
<P>
So the scramble is on to raise taxes, beginning with hikes on gasoline, alcohol 
and tobacco. Politicians regard such taxes as painless, although gasoline taxes 
hit Western states harder than Eastern states and are inherently unfair because 
the same burden is levied on rich and poor. Indeed, poorer people, with older 
cars, will pay more. 
</P>
<P>
Objections will arise. "There should be equity involved," says Professor Frank 
Levy of the University of Maryland, an expert on income distribution. "It's 
particularly unjust at a time of widening income inequality to try closing the 
budget deficit on the backs of those who've been less fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, the government's quest for revenues will lead to income taxes. A 
higher tax on the Social Security benefits of well-to-do retirees is probable. 
But the elderly will benefit from a new lower tax rate -- probably 20% or so -- 
on gains from investments in businesses, stocks and real estate. 
</P>
<P>
The marginal rate on the highest incomes will almost certainly be hiked to 33%, 
from 28% at present, as public opinion shifts against business executives and 
Wall Street deal makers who made big incomes in the 1980s -- and politicians 
say they'll close the deficit by taxing millionaires. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble is, there aren't that many millionaires -- the top 1% of taxpayers 
includes folks with less than $100,000 in annual adjusted gross income. And 
while the rich pay taxes, they also pay tax accountants $250 an hour to see 
they don't pay too much. 
</P>
<P>
So Congress will be reaching for new taxes down through the top 20% of 
taxpayers, to two-earner couples with income above $50,000. Those taxpayers 
can't afford $250 an hour, but they'll pay $50 to get tax help. 
</P>
<P>
And the result will be a return to the days of tax shelters, a reversal of the 
flat tax reform of 1986 that was praised by Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) for 
allowing people "to invest money to make money, not to lose money for tax 
purposes." 
</P>
<P>
That 1986 reform worked. More people paid up and federal tax receipts rose $50 
billion to 20% of the gross national product, from 19% and less in previous 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of my clients gave up tax shelters because the deals no longer made 
sense," says Philip Holthouse, a tax accountant in the Los Angeles firm of 
Parks, Palmer, Turner &amp; Yemenidjian. Now his clients will once again look 
for ways to shelter income. 
</P>
<P>
You have to wonder why tax law changes so much -- this will be the ninth tax 
change in 14 years -- when practically all taxpayers end up paying the same 20% 
to 25% of their income in federal taxes no matter what. 
</P>
<P>
The explanation for the changes, and the growth of the income tax, goes back 
about 100 years, according to UC Berkeley scholars Carolyn Webber and Aaron 
Wildavsky. In their massive "History of Taxation and Expenditure in the Western 
World," they write that "as governments in Europe and America assumed 
responsibility for citizens' personal welfare, by funding public roads and 
water supply as well as public insurance against unemployment and old age, the 
idea arose that in an industrial society -- where differences in wealth exist 
-- the fairest way to raise taxes was on the ability to pay" -- that is, 
through a graduated or progressive income tax. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since, the need for taxes has grown along with demands for social benefits 
-- to the point today that taxes and government budgets seem to grow 
continuously. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Ronald Reagan tried to stop that process -- lowering tax rates and 
limiting government in the belief that citizens were better off assuming more 
responsibility for their own welfare. It was a controversial position. 
Inevitably, some citizens suffered -- but public roads and water supplies 
suffered too. 
</P>
<P>
And now George Bush has signaled that he doesn't believe in Reagan's policies 
anyway. He believes government should meet increased needs, in education and 
the environment, in drug rehabilitation and aid to the Soviet Union -- read his 
"kinder, gentler" lips -- and he wants higher taxes to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
Is that wrong? "It's not a matter of right or wrong," says Wildavsky, "but of 
political philosophy. What kind of society do we want?" 
</P>
<P>
George Bush last week -- more than 10 years after he called Reagan's policies 
"voodoo economics" -- asked for the money to pay for the kind of society he 
wants.

WHY TRUMP'S TROUBLES ARE FAR FROM OVER; 
</P>
<P>
SHUTTLE: IT MAY BE HARD FOR HIM TO SELL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once upon a time a number of airlines bore the names of their owners or 
founders. Remember Muse? How about Laker? Or Braniff? 
</P>
<P>
They're all gone. And although the Trump Shuttle is in no danger of biting the 
dust, there's a good chance it won't bear the name of its flamboyant owner much 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
The Trump Shuttle, which operates on the busy corridor between New York and 
Washington and New York and Boston, is for sale. To help restructure his debts 
over the next few months, Donald Trump is hoping to sell the commuter airline, 
which he acquired in June, 1989, from bankrupt Eastern Airlines for $368 
million. He has said he wants $600 million for the operation, but airline 
observers say that's more than twice its worth. In fact, some say the line is 
worth less than Trump paid for it. 
</P>
<P>
But it won't be easy for the real estate and gambling magnate to dispose of the 
shuttle, even for a lot less than $600 million. For one thing, Pan Am Corp. has 
put its competing shuttle on the block, and for several reasons, it will likely 
sell first. 
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that Pan Am will be desperate for cash by the end of the 
summer, when it enters the unprofitable fall and winter flying season. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Pan Am's investment in its shuttle is said to be about $100 million, 
much lower than what Trump invested in his airline. (Beyond the purchase price, 
Trump is said to have spent $30 million to $40 million sprucing up the planes 
and terminals.) This will allow Pan Am to accept a lower price than Trump while 
still profiting. Finally, the Trump Shuttle carries more debt than Pan Am's. 
</P>
<P>
Edmund S. Greenslet, an airline analyst based in Ponte Verde Beach, Fla., says 
the value of all airline assets has slipped in the past year. When Trump bought 
the shuttle, Greenslet notes, there was a $300-a-share offer on the table for 
UAL Corp., the parent of United Airlines. The offer collapsed for lack of 
financing, and UAL's unions are struggling to arrange financing for a buyout of 
the airline for $201 a share. 
</P>
<P>
"All airline assets have declined by a third," he said. "The same would be true 
of the shuttle. In fact, all corporate assets are down" since the takeover boom 
has subsided. 
</P>
<P>
Greenslet today puts a price tag of $200 million to $250 million on the Trump 
Shuttle. Scott Hamilton, editor of Dallas-based Commercial Aviation Report, a 
highly regarded industry newsletter, estimates that it would fetch only $144 
million to $172 million, based on the value of the carrier's airport gates, its 
landing rights (also known as slots) and its 20 operating Boeing 727s, all of 
them old. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem is the downturn in the New England economy, which has greatly 
reduced shuttle patronage. Meanwhile, rail service between Boston and 
Washington is improving, boosting the train's share of travelers. The travel 
time from central city to central city is about the same for planes and trains. 
</P>
<P>
Greenslet concedes that the shuttle has unique values. He notes that the 
airline has gates and slots at Washington's National and New York's LaGuardia 
airports, both so congested that gates are in great demand and slots are 
rationed. Some observers maintain that an airline might purchase the shuttle 
not to run it but simply to acquire the slots for its other route operations -- 
or to prevent its competitors from getting the slots. 
</P>
<P>
"If you prevent someone else from getting it," said Prof. Frank Spencer of the 
Northwestern University Transportation Center in Evanston, Ill., "you have 
market domination for a number of years." But, he said, airlines that want the 
shuttle's gates and slots don't want its employees and pension obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Nobles, who was replaced Friday as Trump Shuttle president, said recently 
Trump "would rather not sell the shuttle. He loves the shuttle. It is not for 
sale at a bargain-basement price. The shuttle has tremendous potential, (but) 
at this point, if someone offers him a lot of money, he would sell. All of the 
assets owned by Mr. Trump would be for sale if someone offers the right price." 
</P>
<P>
Nobles noted that other airlines have expressed interest in the shuttle and 
that financial data had been supplied to a number of them. But he said no 
negotiations are under way, nor has any formal offer been made. American 
Airlines and America West Airlines are among the carriers reported to be 
interested. 
</P>
<P>
The airline is "cash positive," Nobles maintained. But according to a recent 
Trump report to the Transportation Department, the shuttle posted a net loss of 
$20 million for the three months ended March 31 and has lost $80 million in the 
nine months since the operation was bought from Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
Nobles says the airline was not expected to make a profit for at least a year, 
possibly two, and the Trump Organization said as much publicly a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is a troubling decline in the shuttle's market share since June 10 
last year, when Trump bought the carrier from Eastern. Shortly after Pan Am 
began to compete against the Eastern Shuttle a few years ago, Eastern held 70% 
of the market. Trump Shuttle now has an estimated 49% of the market compared to 
Pan Am's 51%. 
</P>
<P>
On top of his other troubles, Trump has had difficulties with banks that 
financed his shuttle purchase. According to Hamilton of Commercial Aviation 
Report, Trump recently negotiated a waiver from some terms of his loan, such as 
maintaining a $20-million cash balance. The shuttle needed the cash to pay its 
bills, Hamilton said. Trump's banks also agreed to let him defer principal 
payments on his loan until maturity. 
</P>
<P>
Some aviation industry experts contend that Trump had no business investing in 
an airline in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"Donald Trump is in deep kimchee with his shuttle, proving once again that 
amateurs, financial wizards, astronauts, Air Force generals, MBAs and other 
whiz kids from other walks of life make lousy airline presidents," says a 
monthly newsletter published by Avmark Inc., a respected Arlington, Va., 
aviation consulting firm. "Time and again people, often rich or with access to 
riches, have bought or started an airline. They have never succeeded. . . ."

WHY TRUMP'S TROUBLES ARE FAR FROM OVER;

<P>
ATLANTIC CITY: THIS IS NO LAS VEGAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM FURLONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Developer Donald J. Trump's financial problems are rooted deeply in the faded 
seaside resort of Atlantic City, N.J., where he has such a high profile that 
the town has gotten the nickname of "Trump City." 
</P>
<P>
Trump's extensive gambling operations there were once thought to be the cash 
machines that would sustain his financial empire, but it was not to be. The 
rest of Trump's empire has proved so expensive to run that his three 
casino-hotels, which have had their own problems, have not carried the load. 
</P>
<P>
Trump has close to $2 billion invested in Atlantic City, and the ultimate fate 
of his empire may well be decided by how his casinos do financially during the 
current tourist season that ends in September. 
</P>
<P>
Like all casino operators, Trump has been hurt by the singular maladies 
afflicting Atlantic City, a racially divided town of 35,000 that offers none of 
the glamour and excitement of its primary competitor, Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
While Las Vegas has thrived, the gambling industry in Atlantic City stumbled 
badly after hitting a peak in 1983, when it earned nearly $169 million. 
</P>
<P>
Hurt by rising promotion expenses and flat revenues, the casino-hotels lost 
more than $4 million in the first three months of 1990, according to the Casino 
Assn. of New Jersey, a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
The financial picture prompted Thomas D. Carver, the association's president, 
to suggest that Atlantic City may need "radical change" if it is to prosper 
once again. Seven of the city's casinos are losing money, Carver noted, while 
two others are marginally profitable. 
</P>
<P>
One problem is that many casinos are heavily in debt because they were financed 
with high-yield junk bonds, meaning they face huge interest expenses on top of 
their other operating costs. Trump has heavy junk bond debts on each of his 
casino-hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic City has high building and labor costs as well as pervasive poverty 
and a high crime rate. Its slums abut the seaside Boardwalk, along which 10 of 
the city's 12 casinos are situated. 
</P>
<P>
Whereas Las Vegas' gaudy Strip does not fully awaken until sundown, the 
Boardwalk is a virtual no man's land most nights. "It's generally pretty 
deserted except during the height of the tourist season," said Carl Zeitz, a 
casino industry consultant and a former member of the New Jersey Casino Control 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Zeitz said state lawmakers in New Jersey have ambivalent feelings about 
gambling, which has prevented casino gaming from expanding and flourishing as 
it has in Nevada. Atlantic City's first casino opened in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
"New Jersey has not come to terms with gambling," he said. "We keep holding our 
nose. Yes, we legalized gambling, but we seem to view it as offensive. You 
cannot have it both ways." 
</P>
<P>
Although intended to limit the influence of organized crime, tough state rules 
have snuffed out the liveliness that makes Las Vegas such a draw, according to 
Zeitz. There are prohibitions against round-the-clock gambling and curbs on the 
kinds of games played in the casinos. 
</P>
<P>
A requirement that new casino-hotels have at least 500 hotel rooms has also 
prevented the spread of smaller casino-hotels and meant that potential casino 
operators must invest at least $300 million to enter the market, Zeitz said. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantic City also does not have a major municipal airport, a critical 
shortcoming that prevents the town from attracting gamblers much beyond the 
middle part of the Eastern Seaboard. Most gamblers drive there from cities in 
New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
Other limitations include a shortage of first-class hotel rooms, a dearth of 
parking and inhospitable weather that limits the peak tourist season to May 
through September. Casino industry regulatory costs are also much higher than 
they are in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
On the plus side, Atlantic City is soon to get a new mayor, James Whelan, who 
many locals hope will usher in a era of honesty, racial harmony and better ties 
between the casino industry and the city's residents. 
</P>
<P>
A white man who ran with significant black support, Whelan soundly defeated 
James L. Usry, a former school teacher and semi-pro basketball player who was 
indicted in January on charges of bribery and official misconduct. Usry is 
black. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hopefully a new beginning," said Redenia Gilliam-Mosee, an executive with 
one of the casinos who grew up in Atlantic City and used to make $30 a week 
working as a chambermaid. 
</P>
<P>
Reached at his home, Whelan turned down an interview, saying he was too busy. 
"I'm swamped with paper work," he said. He takes office shortly. 
</P>
<P>
The Trump properties in Atlantic City today are a mixed bag of success, failure 
and question marks. 
</P>
<P>
Only Trump Plaza, at the center of the Boardwalk, has been a consistent 
moneymaker in recent years, and even it ran into bad luck in February when it 
lost more than more than $6 million at baccarat to a Tokyo real estate tycoon 
named Akio Kashiwagi. 
</P>
<P>
Using $200,000 chips, Kashiwagi lost more than $9 million at the casino-hotel 
in mid-May, though, so profits should rebound sharply in the second quarter, 
said one official in the Trump Organization. (The Trump Plaza's first-quarter 
loss was $3.67 million.) 
</P>
<P>
Trump Castle is clearly the weakest link. Situated on an inland marina well 
away from the Boardwalk, Trump has invested more than $400 million in the 
casino-hotel, which has lost money at mounting rates for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
Trump barely met $42.6 million in payments on the Trump Castle bonds last 
Tuesday, avoiding formal default only with an emergency $20-million bank loan 
hours before the midnight deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The Taj Mahal is the giant unknown, so expensive to build that already there 
are serious doubts about whether it will be able to meet the next interest 
payment on its bonds, due Nov. 15. The Taj opened in April at a cost of more 
than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The man originally chosen to run the Taj, Mark Grossinger Etess, was killed 
last fall in a helicopter crash, along with Stephen F. Hyde, who was Trump's 
top gaming executive. Some industry insiders believe Trump has never recovered 
from that blow. 
</P>
<P>
By some accounts, Trump has become unglued without Hyde, a popular and 
respected industry veteran who acted as a buffer between the volatile developer 
and the rest of the staff. Trump has since become increasingly active in the 
casino management, displaying a seat-of-the-pants style that has worn badly 
with some underlings. 
</P>
<P>
Jack O'Donnell, former president of the Trump Plaza, quit in May because he 
tired of Trump's style. O'Donnell was particularly disgusted by Trump's 
criticism of Hyde's business decisions after Hyde died. 
</P>
<P>
The grand opening of the Taj was marred by snafus and confusion, leading Trump 
to demote the general manager. Another executive, the chief financial officer, 
collapsed of exhaustion and was later let go. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Taj shattered all records in its first month of operation, raking in 
gambling winnings of $34.4 million -- the best monthly showing of any casino in 
the history of Atlantic City gambling. The Taj took in $36.5 million more in 
gambling winnings in May. 
</P>
<P>
The success, however, appears to have come at the expense of the weaker 
casinos, including the Trump Castle. Doubters also point out that Trump 
borrowered too much to build what is the world's most expensive casino. 
</P>
<P>
He raised $675 million in junk bonds in late 1988 at an interest rate of 14% to 
finish construction of the hotel, and even Moody's Investors Service, the 
debt-rating agency, has suggested that Trump is headed for a possible default 
on the Taj bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Outside experts believe the Taj needs to take in about $475 million a year -- 
and perhaps much more -- just to break even. Whether it will or not is a clear 
concern to New Jersey's casino regulators. 
</P>
<P>
"Some days (at the Taj) are fantastic and other days are not up to 
expectations," said Anthony J. Parrillo, head of the New Jersey Division of 
Gaming Enforcement. "It's still too early to tell."

MONEY TALK: NO EASY REWARDS FOR TURNING IN TAX CHEATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Q: Tell me about the Internal Revenue Service's tax tipster program. I think I 
know a man who is cheating on his taxes, and I bet the IRS would be interested 
in what I know. But, before proceeding, I need to be sure that the program is 
completely anonymous. Is there any way this guy could find out who tipped off 
the feds? Also, I've heard that informants get a reward. Is this true? -- A.R. 
</P>
<P>
A: The IRS has operated a confidential informant program for years to catch tax 
cheaters. The agency's tipster hot lines receive thousands of calls every 
month, and informants can receive rewards of up to $100,000 for providing 
information that leads to the successful recovery of back taxes. 
</P>
<P>
However, before you run for the closest telephone -- that toll free number is 
(800) 424-1040 and be sure to ask for the criminal investigations division -- 
you should know several things about the program. First, precise details are 
very important. In fact, the IRS determines the amount of your reward based on 
the level of details you provide and whether those details were important to 
any final recovery. 
</P>
<P>
The kinds of details IRS investigators are most interested in are: the tax 
years the violations occurred; any aliases used by the taxpayer; the address, 
social security number and employer identification number of the taxpayer; bank 
account data, and any documents you have to support the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Don't just call and say "John Doe cheated on his taxes last year." You have to 
explain how Doe operates his tax scam. Furthermore, tipping the IRS to an enemy 
just to make his life miserable won't do any good unless you really have the 
goods on the guy. The investigators who take the tips are seasoned and know a 
bogus tip when they hear one. 
</P>
<P>
You should also know that the IRS doesn't pay its tipsters until it actually 
gets the back taxes, and only then upon demand from the informant. 
</P>
<P>
Even after tipping the IRS to a cheater, you have to file a claim -- it's Form 
211 -- to get your share. 
</P>
<P>
"This isn't like the lottery," says William Gillian, chief of the criminal 
investigation division of the IRS' Los Angeles branch. "There's no easy 
payoff." Gillian notes that a successful prosecution can take years, and 
payment of back taxes can stretch on even longer. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, any rewards paid by the IRS are considered taxable income to the 
tipster. So, even if you get a reward, you could end up paying as much as a 
third of it -- at today's tax rates -- to the state and federal government. 
</P>
<P>
If you're still interested, here's what your tips could be worth. 
</P>
<P>
For specific information that caused the investigation and resulted in 
recovery, a tipster can receive 10% of the first $75,000 recovered (not 
including interest), 5% of the next $25,000 and 1% of anything more, up to a 
maximum reward of $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
According to our calculations, you would have to hand the IRS tips for a fairly 
iron-clad case that resulted in a payoff to the IRS of more than $9.2 million 
in order to receive the maximum reward of $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
For information that caused the investigation but was less valuable and less 
specific, the reward is 5% of the first $75,000, 2.5% of the next $25,000 and 
0.5% of the remainder, up to a maximum reward of $100,000. Simply tipping 
investigators to a suspected cheat can earn a reward of 1% of the first $75,000 
recovered and 0.5% of anything more, up to the same maximum reward of $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
How confidential is the informant program? The IRS says "very." Gillian says 
the names of tipsters are stored in IRS vaults away from prying eyes; in 
California, they are kept in the IRS facility in Fresno. Informants' names are 
not revealed to investigators working on the case. The tipster's identity is 
not matched with the case until payment is made at the informant's request. 
</P>
<P>
For more information about the program, Southern California residents may call 
these numbers: (213) 894-4151 for Los Angeles and Ventura counties; (714) 
836-2872 for Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, and (619) 557-6100 
for San Diego County. Ask for the criminal investigations division. Or you may 
obtain IRS Publication No. 733 at your local IRS office. 
</P>

Survivor Benefits from Pension Plans 
</P>
<P>
Q: My friend's husband took early retirement six years ago. He later died, and 
my friend was shocked to discover that his pension stopped with his death. Now 
my husband, who also took early retirement, has suffered a stroke and is not 
recovering. How can I find out whether his pension ends with his death? I think 
it is unfair to non-working wives to be left without at least some of their 
husbands' pensions. Shouldn't there be laws to protect women like me? Also, 
what if I divorce my husband? Could I get a part of his pension that way? -- 
M.A. 
</P>
<P>
A: First, there is a law that provides just the sort of spousal protection that 
you are talking about. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Retirement Equity Act, which became effective in 1985, a spouse must 
consent to the type and terms of the pension plan a worker elects to receive at 
retirement. The law was designed to prevent just the type of horror your friend 
undoubtedly experienced when she learned that her husband's pension did not 
continue, even at a reduced rate, after his death. 
</P>
<P>
It is entirely possible that this law became effective after your husband 
elected the terms of his pension. But you can still find out what those terms 
are. Simply contact the pension plan administrator at his former company. 
</P>
<P>
Also, our experts advise that it may be possible for your husband -- if he is 
not incompetent or completely incapacitated -- to change the terms of his 
pension payment. Again, you can check this through the company. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, what is this about a divorce? A divorce would do you absolutely no 
good in securing coverage under your husband's pension, and, quite possibly, it 
could harm your chances because you would no longer have any claim as a spouse. 
</P>
<P>
Again, our advisers say your best bet is to check the terms of the pension with 
the company and, if necessary, attempt to change them to suit your needs. 
</P>
<P>
Even if you're not at or near retirement, this is probably as good a time as 
any to check how your pension plan is structured. 
</P>
<P>
Do payments continue when you die? If so, at what level? Are you satisfied with 
the choices you made years ago, when retirement seemed as remote as the moon? 
If not, can you change them? Should you? 
</P>
<P>
This is not just an issue for older folks, so make sure you and your family are 
adequately protected.

MUTUAL FUNDS: SPOTTING CLUES THAT TELL WHEN IT'S TIME TO SELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES is editor of Personal Investor, a national 
consumer-finance magazine based in Irvine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sooner or later, even a good mutual fund will fall into a rut. That's normal. 
Sometimes the slump lasts for only a few months. On other occasions, things go 
from bad to worse. How can you tell when it's time to get out? 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, there are no easy answers. In many respects, it's more difficult 
to know when to sell than to buy. Professional advisers usually weigh several 
factors before recommending that investors bail out of a fund. They look for 
changes in the fund's performance, management, asset base and more. 
</P>
<P>
Of these danger signals, poor performance looms as the most critical. "This is 
the biggest flag," says Jack Walsh, editor of the United Mutual Fund Selector 
newsletter in Wellesley, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
However, it's not enough simply to spot a lagging fund. You've got to find out 
if there's a genuine problem. Sometimes the underperformance can be explained 
-- in fact, predicted -- by the fund's investment objectives. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, you can expect "defensive" or low-volatility stock portfolios to 
lag during market rallies. These funds aim to minimize losses, so they will 
forsake some upside potential to reduce risk. 
</P>
<P>
"You should watch the relative performance of your fund, but you need to 
compare it to that of similar types of funds," says Walter Rouleau, editor of 
the Growth Fund Guide newsletter in Rapid City, S.D. Defensive equity 
portfolios routinely hold cash and sometimes even bonds to guard against a 
possible stock market reversal. 
</P>
<P>
So don't panic if your fund lags the bellwether Standard &amp; Poor's 500 or 
other market indexes. But you should be concerned if it trails other funds in 
its group for several months or more. That's been the case lately with Mutual 
Shares and Vanguard Windsor, two growth-and-income portfolios with 
exceptionally good long-term records. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of 1989, these two legends were ranked No. 3 and No. 12, 
respectively, out of 361 mutual funds with 15-year records, according to Lipper 
Analytical Services. Since then, however, both Mutual Shares and Windsor have 
been beaten by the average growth-and-income fund, as well as by the S&amp;P 
500. 
</P>
<P>
After a year and a half of relatively poor numbers, should investors throw in 
the towel? No, says Craig Litman of Litman/Gregory &amp; Co., a San Francisco 
money management firm specializing in mutual funds. He cites the funds' 
excellent long-term records and notes that defensive portfolios of this type 
will typically underperform during bull markets. 
</P>
<P>
Litman also points out that the managers who chalked up the good long-term 
numbers -- John Neff of Windsor and Michael Price of Mutual Shares -- are still 
at the helm. If the funds had gotten new leadership and then started to falter, 
that would have been a danger signal, Litman says. "The most important reason 
to get out of a fund would be a change in managers." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh agrees that you need to watch a personnel transition closely. His 
newsletter downgraded Fidelity Magellan from a "buy" to a "hold" as a result of 
Peter Lynch's resignation as portfolio manager on May 31. Walsh concedes that 
Morris Smith, Lynch's successor, has a good track record of his own, yet he 
questions whether Smith can duplicate Lynch's performance. "With all due 
respect to Morris Smith, there are very few Peter Lynches," he says. "There are 
maybe 40 to 50 top managers out of 3,000 funds." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the only time you need not be concerned about the loss of a proven 
portfolio manager is when the fund follows a team approach. At Twentieth 
Century Investors in Kansas City, Mo., for example, five managers have a hand 
in running all seven equity funds, selecting stocks according to a rigid 
discipline that keys on accelerating earnings. Twentieth Century's funds could 
probably continue to perform as well as ever even if one or two managers left. 
</P>
<P>
The American Funds Group in Los Angeles also follows a team approach to 
investing. 
</P>
<P>
Many experts also would consider a radical drop in a fund's asset base as a 
possible sell signal. There's nothing unusual about a portfolio that shrinks 
during bearish phases. But be careful when assets fall significantly while the 
market is rising. 
</P>
<P>
That could indicate poor stock selection, inferior shareholder services or 
other problems. When assets decline, the fund's costs must be spread over a 
smaller base, which usually results in a greater burden for the remaining 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, when a fund adds an annual 12b-1 fee, that will tend to raise 
expenses for all shareholders and hurt performance. If the charge exceeds 1% or 
so a year, you might want to sell. 
</P>
<P>
And there are other red flags, such as a fund that radically departs from its 
stated investment policy. This would include a small-company portfolio that 
starts purchasing large stocks or a growth fund that buys bonds. Fund companies 
must put a significant policy change up for shareholder ratification. "A proxy 
vote to adopt new investment tactics might be a sell signal," Litman says. 
</P>
<P>
But even a new manager, a shrinking asset base or a change in investment policy 
will show up eventually in the performance numbers. For this reason, some 
advisers suggest that you worry about just one thing: a downward trend in the 
fund's price. 
</P>
<P>
Bert Dohmen, editor of the Wellington Letter in Honolulu, belongs to this camp. 
He believes that everything good or bad about a fund will already be reflected 
in its price trend, so there's no sense in trying to analyze much else. "I 
don't care what the bullish or bearish factors are -- just that they exist." 
</P>
<P>
Dohmen suggests using a "trailing stop loss" to determine when to sell. This is 
a simple system to follow. You merely decide to redeem your shares when the 
fund drops by a predetermined amount. For example, if the average weekly price 
declines until it's more than 10% below the high for the previous 12 months, 
you would sell. "This helps you avoid big trouble without forcing you out of 
the market during moderate corrections," he says. 
</P>
<P>
All you have to do is keep track of the current price in relation to the 
12-month high and figure out how big a decline you could stand to sustain. 
Dohmen recommends selling after a 10% drop, since a normal market correction 
would run 5% to 8%, he says. 
</P>
<P>
The hardest part about this approach is following it rigidly: You need to be 
sufficiently disciplined so that you don't do any second-guessing. "When I get 
a sell signal, I sell," Dohmen says. "I don't ask why." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A WAY TO CUT LOSSES 
</P>
<P>
While there's no foolproof way to know when to sell a mutual fund, a "trailing 
stop loss" can at least minimize the damage from a significant price drop. Bert 
Dohmen, editor of the Wellington Letter in Honolulu, suggests that you redeem 
shares as soon as a fund declines 10% below its high price for the previous 12 
months. In the following example, you would ride out all short-term 
fluctuations until the fund falls to $16.20, down 10% from its peak of $18. 
</P>
<P>
An automatic discipline such as this can help remove emotions and judgment 
calls from the sell decision. However, you will eventually face another key 
question: When to buy back in?

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: I am close to retirement and will receive 15,000 shares of Rockwell 
International stock when I leave that company. I see that in the past month or 
so Rockwell's stock has moved off its $22-$23 base and is around $27 a share. 
Since the recent events in Eastern Europe could bring hard times for the 
aerospace industry, should I hold on to the stock? -- Westminster 
</P>
<P>
A: Rockwell has problems, but not because of its defense business. 
</P>
<P>
The company isn't as dependent on military contracts as most people think. In 
fact, Thomas McNaugher, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, says work 
from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is far more important to 
Rockwell, "and NASA's budget is going up." 
</P>
<P>
McNaugher says Rockwell is one of the fortunate companies that saw the writing 
on the Berlin Wall in the mid-1980s and started weaning itself from defense 
contracts. The company now does lots of business with car makers and the 
publishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
But Rockwell has other worries. As you've probably read, neither the automotive 
industry nor the publishing business is doing particularly well. And the 
strength of Rockwell's stock has at least one Wall Street analyst concerned. 
Paul Nisbet of Prudential-Bache Inc. says the shares are "somewhat overpriced, 
given the flat earnings and revenue growth picture we see for the next three to 
four years." 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest problems the company has is that many newspapers have 
already purchased the big, expensive color presses that Rockwell develops. And 
those that haven't probably can't afford them in today's business environment. 
Nisbet is telling clients to hold on to their shares; don't sell, don't buy 
more. He thinks that Rockwell will earn $2.55 a share this year and $2.75 in 
1991. The company had a profit of $2.87 a share in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Institutional Brokers Estimate System computer shows that Nisbet's 
estimates for Rockwell's earnings aren't much different from those of his 
peers. The average estimate among analysts who follow Rockwell is $2.54 a share 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have two certificates from the registrar of the Land Office in St. Louis. 
One is signed by Franklin Pierce and dated June 10, 1856. The other is signed 
by Zachary Taylor and dated June 1, 1850. They should have some value. Whom 
could I contact to see how much they are worth? -- Hermann, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
A: Zachary Taylor was the 12th President of the United States. He was in office 
from his inauguration in 1849 until his death in early July, 1850. If it is 
authentic, President Taylor's signature is worth about $950, according to Haley 
Garrison, an expert in antique financial documents. There is a big "if" here 
that I will get back to in a moment. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin Pierce was the 14th President and was in office from 1853 to 1857. His 
signature is worth about $600, Garrison says. He apparently liked to sign his 
name a lot more than President Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
As happens today, Presidents don't always sign documents themselves, leaving 
that chore to secretaries and assistants. So the signatures on your 
certificates may not be authentic. Garrison says if you send him photostats, 
he'll try to determine if they are. He can be reached at (800) 451-4504. 
</P>
<P>
For all the other readers who wrote to me about antique financial documents 
that they want evaluated, you can call Garrison, R. M. Smythe &amp; Co. at 
(800) 622-1880 or Scott Winslow at (800) 225-6233. They do some types of 
evaluations for free but charge for others. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am 70, retired and living on a limited income. The few assets that I have 
are invested in Templeton Global Income Fund. I bought into it at $8.875 a 
share, and the price has moved to $7.50. Does fluctuation in interest rates 
have an influence on this type of fund? Is this fund a wise choice for the 
short and long haul? -- Sarasota, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
A: The Templeton Global Income fund is a closed-end bond fund that trades on 
the New York Stock Exchange. It is one of a number operated by John Templeton, 
considered one of the smartest investors around. The Global Income Fund invests 
in bonds of companies around the world. In 1989, the fund rose 5.2%. It's down 
about 0.2% this year. Neither performance would get the fund into the record 
books. 
</P>
<P>
Incidentally, it recently had a net asset value of $8.23 a share. The folks at 
Templeton say John Templeton is so sure that the fund will do well that he 
invested $1.4 million of his own money in it. But the truth is that a fund of 
this kind carries multiple risks. 
</P>
<P>
Norman Fosback, president of the Institute for Econometric Research, a 
newsletter publisher in Ft. Lauderdale, points out that not only does this fund 
react to changes in interest rates, but it also fluctuates on the value of the 
dollar. "If the U.S. dollar goes up 20%, all things being equal, you are going 
to lose 20%," Fosback says. 
</P>
<P>
Someone looking for less volatility in his investments should "leave the 
currency risk to professionals," Fosback says. "There is no reason for a 
70-year-old to get involved in this," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I read in a newsletter that an investor could purchase stock without dealing 
with a broker. I would appreciate knowing if you have heard of this method. -- 
Kenmore, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
A: "Theoretically, you can do it," says Enno Hobbing, a spokesman for the 
National Assn. of Securities Dealers, the self-regulatory brokerage industry 
group. "But I've hardly heard of it" being done. 
</P>
<P>
If a friend owns a share of AT&amp;T and wants to sell it to you, all you have 
to do is give him an agreed-upon price, and he can sign the stock certificate 
over to you. Then you'd have to contact the stock's transfer agent, which is 
usually listed on the certificate, so the company knows that you are the new 
owner and are entitled to dividends. 
</P>
<P>
Now suppose you met a stranger on a street corner. "Psst," he says. "Ya wanna 
buy some AT&amp;T stock?" You could, theoretically, also do this transaction 
without a broker. Handle it in the same way as with your friend. But, of 
course, you have no way of knowing whether the stock is valid. The stranger 
could have printed it in his basement, or it could be stolen. "You don't know 
what you are getting," says Hobbing. JOHN CRUDELE

DONALD TRUMP'S WOES ARE NO LAUGHING MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Allan Sloan seems to think that it is fun to watch a man go down the tubes. His 
immature delight over Donald J. Trump's financial problems only sheds light to 
me of the columnist's sadism and the fact that he probably should be writing 
for one of the scandal tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
The reporting of information was as shallow as his attitude, and it is 
fortunate that he was not writing an article on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
While he was rolling in the aisles he forgot to let us know about the effects 
of the Trump default on bondholders and the shareholders, the market, the 
economy in the areas of Trump holdings, the position the lawyers involved in 
the Trump divorce are now taking and probably a multitude of other 
ramifications that a good reporter would look into in a situation like this. 
</P>
<P>
I am sure your readers, including this one, would not delight in the fact that 
Mr. Sloan lost his job even though we would rather read about business in the 
Business section.

DONALD TRUMP'S WOES ARE NO LAUGHING MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I thought Allan Sloan's "Trump-In-A-Jam Show to Be Top Entertainment," (June 
18) about Donald J. Trump was excellent up to a point. But the last paragraph, 
"Stay tuned to The Perils of The Donald. 
</P>
<P>
It's going to be a lot of fun," was, I think, a "below the belt" kind of 
remark. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, Trump overextended himself and I'm sure he deserves whatever he may 
experience in the future, but he wasn't in these schemes all by himself. The 
bankers and lending institutions had an obligation to rein in Donald's 
extravagance. 
</P>
<P>
If Donald, albeit a self-centered egotistical person, really is financially 
dying, then why can't we let him die with as much dignity as he can muster, not 
reach down and twist the knife a little for our own gratification?

EDBERG, CHANG RALLY TO PREVAIL IN FIVE SETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
How does Stefan Edberg play Wimbledon? 
</P>
<P>
Very quietly. It seems as though the only sound he makes here comes from the 
ball meeting the strings of his racket. But this is routine stuff for the 
silent Swede, who is once again slipping almost unnoticed through the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
On a blustery Saturday, Edberg blew both hot and cold, yet arrived in the 
quarterfinals relatively unscathed with a 6-4, 5-7, 3-6, 6-2, 9-7 victory over 
Amos Mansdorf of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Edberg's opponent in the next round is Michael Chang, who also took the long 
road in his third-round match. Chang came from two sets down to defeat Mark 
Kratzmann of Australia, 3-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Chang, who is 6-1 in five-set matches, explained how he does it: "You never 
know." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg was able to shine some light on his ability to creep through the draw 
without drawing much attention. There are two reasons why he can do this, 
Edberg said. They are Ivan Lendl and Boris Becker. 
</P>
<P>
Although the majority of the attention has been reserved for Lendl, seeking his 
first Wimbledon title, and Becker, a three-time winner, Edberg cruises along at 
his own pace. 
</P>
<P>
He drives from his home across the Thames in Kensington, beats somebody, then 
goes out to dinner with his Swedish girlfriend, Annette Olsen, and coach Tony 
Pickard.

In the last three years, Edberg has reached at least the semifinals, winning it 
all in 1988 and losing in the finals in 1989. In that period, neither Lendl nor 
Becker has a better record at Wimbledon, although they both are always more 
publicized. 
</P>
<P>
"That's always the case, isn't it," Edberg said. "It's not a big surprise. I 
guess that's the way I like it. I just take it as it is. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are talking about Lendl because he has put in a big effort to 
win this one," he said. "Becker, of course, there is always a lot of talk about 
him when Wimbledon comes up. I'm sort of somewhere behind there. 
</P>
<P>
"It is sort of a good position to be in," he said. "I don't feel I've got too 
much pressure. Now I'm in the second week and I know that if I play well, I can 
go all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Darkness prevented Lendl from getting a step closer to his goal. His match with 
Bryan Shelton of Huntsville, Ala., was halted at one set apiece at about 7:15 
p.m., English time. 
</P>
<P>
That was about a half hour after police evacuated about 10,000 people from 
Centre Court because of a bomb scare. No bomb was found, but police have been 
extra vigilant because a terrorist bomb exploded Monday at a posh London club, 
injuring nine people. Saturday's bomb scare forced the suspension of a doubles 
match in which Jim Grabb and Patrick McEnroe led Ken Flach and Robert Seguso, 
6-1, 3-4. 
</P>
<P>
During the bomb scare, the Lendl-Shelton match continued on Court 1 with Lendl 
winning the first set, 7-6 (7-2), and Shelton taking the second, 7-6 (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
Both will be completed Monday, as today is an off-day. 
</P>
<P>
In other action, Brad Pearce of Provo, Utah, who had never won three matches in 
one pro tournament, chose a good time to do it. Pearce, 24, a 5-foot-9 former 
UCLA star, defeated 6-8 Milan Srjeber of Czechoslovakia, 6-3, 6-3, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
Pearce's Wimbledon experience has not always been so glowing. He lost in the 
first round of 1986 and failed to qualify the last three years. To celebrate 
his victory, he plans to take today off and spend time with his wife, Cindi, 
and 18-month-old daughter, Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe a little picnic, Kentucky Fried Chicken," Pearce said. 
</P>
<P>
But if Pearce emerged in the fourth round, the hopes of three other Americans 
were deep-fried. 
</P>
<P>
Ninth-seeded Jim Courier of Plant City, Fla., lost to Mark Woodforde of 
Australia, 7-5, 5-7, 7-5, 6-4, Jim Grabb of Tucson lost to Christian Bergstrom 
of Sweden, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-2, and Alex Antonitsch of Austria defeated David 
Pate of Las Vegas, 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5). 
</P>
<P>
For a while, Edberg's progression was interrupted by Mansdorf, who scored a 
service break in the first game of the third set. Edberg drilled an easy volley 
into the net and kept running to his chair, where he threw his racket to the 
ground in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
Mansdorf's one-set lead didn't last. His serve was broken twice in the fourth 
set, which Edberg won quickly. But in the fifth set, Mansdorf's serve returned. 
</P>
<P>
At 7-7, Mansdorf speeded his own downfall by double-faulting, and then Edberg 
made the most of a single break-point opportunity. Mansdorf looked at a softly 
hit volley right at him, nudged it into the net, then buried his head in a 
towel. 
</P>
<P>
Pickard pumped his fists. "It was brilliant," he said. "He had only one chance 
and he took it." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg quickly closed out the 3-hour 3-minute match on his serve. Then he 
pronounced the match a complete, if quiet, success. 
</P>
<P>
"I think a match like this is probably going to do me a lot of good," Edberg 
said. "It's good to get one of these matches out of the way, where you really 
have to fight. He gave me only one chance and I was lucky to take it."

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
West German soccer Coach Franz Beckenbauer was right: The World Cup began with 
the second round. 
</P>
<P>
The games picked up in intensity and left millions of fans of this most human 
of games reflecting upon how destiny is, after all, imponderable. 
</P>
<P>
The team that dominated a match did not always win it. These, many fans who 
consider soccer not just a game but a test of national resolve and ingenuity, 
were left, as so often in soccer, to face the unappealable consequences of what 
often seemed random chance. 
</P>
<P>
The second round did not, however, bring a sudden conversion to offensive 
soccer from the defensive style of play that marred the first round. The scores 
tended to remain low, and the differences narrow. 
</P>
<P>
But as most of the games in the second round progressed, they gathered force 
from surges of national pride and the fear of extinction. 
</P>
<P>
Here, on a warm and sunny summer afternoon, in Verona's agreeably middle-sized 
but modern stadium -- a nice complement to the little city's large Roman arena, 
still handsome after 1,900 years -- Spain and Yugoslavia fought through a 
competent but scoreless first half. Had it been the first round, each would 
probably have settled for a scoreless tie and slowed the game to a crawl. 
</P>
<P>
In the first-round game between the Netherlands and Ireland, with each team 
having one point under its belt, they coasted to a tie that guaranteed both of 
them a place in the second round. Watching them play, an observer noted that 
they acted as if they were contending not for the World Cup, but the Nobel 
Peace Prize. 
</P>
<P>
But Spain and Yugoslavia were going not for peace, but for victory, and as the 
game progressed so did the intensity of play. Tied at the end of regulation, 
the game went to Yugoslavia with a goal in the 93rd minute on a wickedly 
powerful and cleverly placed penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
A similar urgency drove the games between West Germany and the Netherlands, and 
England and Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
The stormy German-Dutch match, perhaps the best of the tournament through the 
second round, pitted the Germans' muscular efficiency against the great 
technical skill of the Dutch. 
</P>
<P>
A strategic curiosity contributed to the West Germans' 2-1 victory. With each 
side down one player because of hotly disputed penalties, the 10-man teams 
opened gaps in the field and gave opportunities to the disciplined Germans. 
</P>
<P>
If victory always went to the insistent and skillful aggressor, however, 
Belgium would have beaten England in Bologna. As it was, the Belgians had some 
bad luck -- their ball hit the goal post twice, a feat hard to achieve if you 
tried -- and the English played their traditionally stolid English game: strong 
defense with veteran goalkeeper Peter Shilton, solid conditioning, little 
passing and the long ball. 
</P>
<P>
It was the long ball that brought Belgium down, 1-0. The score came at the 
119th minute, or one minute before overtime would have ended and the game would 
have had to be decided by penalty kicks, as it was when Ireland beat Romania 
entirely by penalty kicks, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was not bad luck alone that stalked Brazil and brought it to its 
painful 1-0 loss to Argentina in the dazzling high-tech stadium at Turin. 
Playing less defensively than it had in the first round, Brazil dominated the 
game but never brought it off. Brazil hit the goal post not twice but three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Argentina had one chance, opened by Diego Maradona, and took it to score. 
</P>
<P>
Brazil, the team everyone loves to watch, has now missed the final since 1970. 
In the last three World Cups, Brazil was eliminated after thrilling but 
heartbreaking games. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps soccer has become too tough a game to be won by virtuosity alone. 
Perhaps the fact that only three of Brazil's World Cup players came from 
Brazilian clubs means that the distinctive panache has been engulfed by the 
European clubs' tactical game. Most of the Brazilian players are obliged for 
financial reasons to play abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the adulation of its fans, 20,000 of whom came to Italy, is alone not 
enough to keep Brazilian soccer going in the style the whole world had come to 
love. The general affection for Brazilian soccer may even have been an 
obstacle, for it may have raised impossible expectations. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface, there was no reason for such long thoughts to haunt the 
Italians as the second round ended. Their team had won every game. It was the 
only team to have had no goal scored against it. And it has been playing at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
Home is not merely Italy, this exuberantly soccer-mad nation. Home is Rome, 
where the green, white and red Italian colors hang from the balconies of the 
flats of the rich and poor alike, where work stops when soccer starts, and 
where, after an Italian victory, the streets of the center of the city are 
filled until well after midnight with cheerful people carrying Italian flags 
and singing in the soft Roman night under a new moon. 
</P>
<P>
Home is in particular and most especially Olympic Stadium, rebuilt on the 
post-World War II Olympic Stadium, which was in turn erected upon the tawdry 
mock-Empire Stadium for Mussolini. 
</P>
<P>
There is nothing the least imitative about the new one, except that in its 
style it reflects the assertively competent and functionally beautiful 
engineering of its ancient ancestors. To hear the roar of the crowd of 70,000 
or more when the blue-shirted Azzurri come on the field, to see the sea of 
waving Italian flags, to experience the intensity of expectation and sheer 
noise as the Italian team builds toward a shot at the goal, is to feel in your 
ears, your teeth and your bones that in the late 20th Century, nationalism is 
not dead. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it is, at least in Italy, the most palpably benign kind of nationalism, the 
joy of country without the anger of those English hooligans who discredit their 
country by working out their frustrations on foreign soil. The cheerfulness and 
goodness of most of the English fans inside the stadiums, however, added much 
to the atmosphere of the games. 
</P>
<P>
Two other nations' fans have shown this quality: the Irish, who are well liked 
for their good humor, and the Brazilians. 
</P>
<P>
Twice in a decade we have seen towns in mourning when the Brazilians had to 
leave the tournament prematurely. This year, it is Turin th for that mourns. 
</P>
<P>
As the quarterfinals began, the Italian hosts of this World Cup were asking 
themselves the nagging question: Just how good are their Blues, the Azzurri? 
When, for instance, in a swamp of humidity and a drizzle of tiny gnats in 
Olympic Stadium, they beat the plucky Uruguayans, 2-0 -- or earlier, the weak 
Americans, 1-0 -- were they doing just enough to win, or did they have it in 
themselves to prevail all the way to the end? 
</P>
<P>
The Italian fans ardently hoped for, and we think deserved, a positive 
response.

<P>
Mike Port can coexist with the concept of free agency, and he can buy the farm, 
but after five years on the job, the Angels' general manager remains 
uncomfortable with one aspect of his trade: Trades. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there are some people who are inclined, by nature or personality or 
whatever, to wheel and deal," Port says. "But with all due respect, Mike Port 
is not the story. If we could go all year without one mention of Mike Port in 
the papers, and without us making one deal, and then have us come away with the 
world's championship, that would be the ideal situation." 
</P>
<P>
Port also says: "Your first priority is to put the best club you can on the 
field. If we could do that through our developmental system only, we would 
stick with that." 
</P>
<P>
And: "We will not make trades for the sake of making trades." 
</P>
<P>
And: "We don't get 10 runs' credit for making a deal." 
</P>
<P>
This would help to explain a lot. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, why Port refused to make an in-season trade during 1988 and '89 
and attempted to patch gaping holes with organizational tape named Junior 
Noboa, Chico Walker, Jack Lazorko and Terry Clark. 
</P>
<P>
Or why Port remained on the sidelines in the middle of a tight American League 
West race while the Oakland Athletics seized the moment and Rickey Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Or why Port backed off potential deals for Tim Raines, Lenny Dykstra and Ellis 
Burks, and settled on Luis Polonia as the man who would bat leadoff. 
</P>
<P>
Or why Port has refused to break up the Dick Schofield-Jack Howell-Devon White 
axis and why he held on to Gary Pettis and Mike Witt long after their market 
values peaked. 
</P>
<P>
Let's make a deal? Given a choice, Port would rather not. To make a trade is to 
engage a risk -- and Port has never been big on the unknown. Back him into a 
corner, leave him with no other options, and Port will deal. But usually as a 
last resort, generally for limited stakes and always after he has consulted his 
manager, his assistant general manager, his advance scout, his scouting 
director, his minor league director, Baseball America, the Sporting News and 
the Solunar Tables. 
</P>
<P>
"He is meticulous," says Bill Bavasi, the Angels' director of minor league 
operations. "He's a detail guy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I know he's got the reputation for being cautious, but I don't think it's 
caution as much as it's the aggressiveness to make the right trade. 'Don't hurt 
the club, do what's right for the club.' With Mike there's a certain 
aggressiveness to always make, if not the perfect deal, then the right deal." 
</P>
<P>
This makes any analysis of Port's trademanship difficult. Does Port make bad 
trades? It depends on your definition. Port's trades almost never hurt the 
Angels. Because he operates in low-risk territory -- little ventured, little 
gained -- his maneuvers usually show a profit. He acquires Bert Blyleven for 
three minor leaguers. He picks up Johnny Ray for two minor leaguers. He gets 
Polonia for Claudell Washington and Rich Monteleone. 
</P>
<P>
But does Port make impact trades? Or enough of them? Look at the American 
League West standings. 
</P>
<P>
Since replacing Buzzie Bavasi as Angel general manager after the 1984 season, 
Port has made one trade that involved a member of his starting lineup -- Gary 
Pettis, after the 1987 season. He has not traded away a starting pitcher, 
unless you count John Candelaria, who took himself out of the rotation in 1987 
and then burned the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Port deals with what he calls "developmental surplus" -- utility infielders, 
long relievers, marginal minor leaguers, Angels on the fringe. That can bring 
in Lance Parrish and Dan Petry, but it won't get you Rickey Henderson or Joe 
Carter. 
</P>
<P>
Port's most significant player moves and free-agent signings have included: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1985 
</P>
<P>
Signed Donnie Moore as a free agent. Port had barely settled into the chair 
behind Buzzie Bavasi's old desk when relief ace Don Aase and outfielder Fred 
Lynn announced they were both jumping to Baltimore. All Port was left with was 
a selection in the pre-1985 compensation draft, which he used to pluck Moore 
off the Atlanta Braves' roster. 
</P>
<P>
Forget Dave Henderson and the disintegration that followed. For two seasons, 
Moore set new standards in Angel relief pitching -- saving a club-record 31 
games in 1985 and 21 in '86, including the AL West championship clincher. 
</P>
<P>
If only the book had shut then. Grade: A- 
</P>
<P>
Signed Ruppert Jones as a free agent. A spare part on the 1984 World Series 
champion Detroit Tigers, Jones was the $330,000 solution to Lynn's departure. 
Jones lived life on his own private space shuttle -- and in his orange 
jumpsuits and tinted goggles, he was dressed for the part -- but during those 
occasional earthbound stretches, he could be a productive player. Jones hit 21 
home runs in 1985 and added 17 in a platoon shift with George Hendrick in '86. 
Grade: B 
</P>
<P>
Traded Mike Brown, Pat Clements and Bob Kipper to Pittsburgh for John 
Candelaria, George Hendrick and Al Holland. Port's first trade was also his 
biggest, which illustrates just how badly he wanted Candelaria in August of 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
Ink on paper says this was a three-for-three deal. Reality pegs it closer to 
five-for-one. Not only did Port have to part with three prospects to get his 
man, he had to agree to absorb the bloated contracts of Holland and Hendrick, 
which was Pittsburgh's main incentive for making the trade. 
</P>
<P>
Candelaria paid off with a divisional title in 1986, Holland lasted barely two 
months, and Hendrick played out the remainder of his contract with the Angels 
-- three long, expensive and exasperating seasons. Joggin' George, you could've 
been someone, but hustling was just too uncool. 
</P>
<P>
Of the players Pittsburgh obtained, only Kipper remains in the major leagues. 
Grade: B+ 
</P>
<P>
Traded Jerome Nelson to Oakland for Don Sutton and Robert Sharpnack. If the 
Angels don't develop Hall of Famers, they do a pretty fair job of renting them. 
Rod Carew got his 3,000th hit as an Angel. Reggie Jackson hit his 500th home 
run as an Angel. And Don Sutton became a 300-game winner as an Angel, 10 months 
after this trade with Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
For the price of a Class A outfielder, the Angels bought Sutton's last good 
season -- he was 15-11 in 1986 -- which proved instrumental in the Angels' last 
division championship. It also bought new secrets into the world of baseball 
arts and crafts. Angel pitchers never knew sandpaper could be so versatile. 
Grade: A 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1986 
</P>
<P>
Traded Luis Sanchez to Montreal for Gary Lucas. Two sour footnotes from Angel 
playoff history: Sanchez served up Cecil Cooper's pennant-winning single in 
Game 5 of the 1982 playoffs, and Lucas had to pick Game 5 of the 1986 playoffs 
to hit his first batter in more than 400 innings. That was Rich Gedman. The 
next batter was Dave Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Angel timing, in a nutshell. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas played two seasons with the Angels, spending nearly as much time on the 
disabled list as on the mound. But the Angels did get five victories and five 
saves from him. Sanchez gave the Expos nothing. He took a left turn at 
Montreal, landed in Japan, played a season and was never heard from again. 
Grade: B 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1987 
</P>
<P>
Traded Bill Merrifield and Miguel Garcia to Pittsburgh for Johnny Ray. Mark 
McLemore casts a dissenting vote, but this ranks among Port's finest moves. 
Merrifield, an infielder of limited skills, wasn't going anywhere in the Angel 
organization, and Garcia was at best a long-range pitching prospect. In return, 
the Angels acquired their 1988 co-MVP and their first .300-hitting regular 
since Carew. 
</P>
<P>
But the deal is docked half a grade for those times Ray is forced to wear a 
fielder's glove. Grade: A- 
</P>
<P>
Traded John Candelaria to the New York Mets for Shane Young and Jeff 
Richardson. When Port dumps a player, watch out below. Candelaria's act pushed 
Port to the brink in 1987 -- the pitcher was arrested twice on suspicion of 
driving while intoxicated, spent a month in a substance-abuse clinic and was 
poison in the clubhouse. He had to go, but Port could have received something 
in return. Young is no longer in the Angel organization, Richardson remains 
mired in the minors and Candelaria, having bounced from the Mets to the Yankees 
to the Expos, has resurfaced in Minnesota, startling even the Twins with his 
7-1 start. Grade: C- 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1988 
</P>
<P>
Traded Gary Pettis to Detroit for Dan Petry. Another dumping. Pettis' 1987 
season was a 133-game horror -- 17 runs batted in, 124 strikeouts and a .208 
batting average in 394 at-bats. Pettis blamed a bad hand; the Angels blamed a 
hard-headed hitting approach. Either way, this relationship was a goner, and 
Port was so eager to unload Pettis, he settled for damaged goods in return. 
Coming off arm surgery, Petry wrenched his back in spring training, missed two 
months of the regular season because of a sprained ankle and finished 3-9. 
Banished to long relief in 1989, Petry was released at season's end and then 
re-upped with Detroit, where he is starting -- and winning -- again. Grade: C 
</P>
<P>
Signed Chili Davis as a free agent. Enough outfield jokes. Name the most 
productive hitter in the Angel lineup since 1988. Name the only Angel to take 
consecutive 90-RBI seasons into 1990. Name the only Angel to take consecutive 
20-home run seasons into 1990. 
</P>
<P>
He isn't named Wally. Grade: A- 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1989 
</P>
<P>
Traded David Holdridge to Philadelphia for Lance Parrish. Some potential for 
long-term repercussions here. Holdridge was a first-round draft choice in 1987 
and, according to Bavasi, "one of the top arms in the organization, certainly." 
Parrish was 32 when the trade was made, coming off his poorest (.215) big 
league season. And there's always the back. 
</P>
<P>
"You hate to lose a kid like Holdridge, but he was drafted the same year as 
John Orton," Bavasi said. "Basically, you could say we drafted both of our 
catchers, Lance Parrish and his backup, in the same draft. How often does that 
happen? And we didn't have to wait three years to develop Parrish." Grade: B+ 
</P>
<P>
Traded Mike Cook, Rob Wassenaar and Paul Sorrento to Minnesota for Bert 
Blyleven. Port's finest hour? 
</P>
<P>
Not all the returns are in -- Sorrento is regarded as one of the Twins' top 
power-hitting prospects -- but for one season, Angel shoelaces weren't the only 
things burned by Blyleven. Besides Sorrento, who had 27 homers and 112 RBIs 
with double-A Orlando, Fla., in 1989, the Twins got a fringe major league 
reliever in Cook and a marginal pitching prospect in Wassenaar. The Angels 
received the American League's comeback player of the year -- 17-5, 2.73 ERA, 
five shutouts and some sorely needed clubhouse leadership, to boot. 
</P>
<P>
Until Sorrento pans out, if and when . . . Grade: A- 
</P>
<P>
Lost Bob Boone as a free agent to Kansas City. Port's worst hour, no question. 
</P>
<P>
Two years of protracted contract hassles, followed by the Parrish trade, 
alienated Boone to the point of no return. He waited for the first offer to 
better his 1988 Angel salary of $883,000, and when Kansas City came in at 
$883,001, Boone was gone, without so much as a phone call to Port or Autry. 
</P>
<P>
This public relations disaster, which prompted the reorganization of the Angel 
front office and the eventual hiring of Dan O'Brien as Port's assistant, was 
salvaged only when Parrish came through with a sound first season as Boone's 
successor. Grade: D- 
</P>
<P>
Signed Claudell Washington as a free agent. The Angels approached their 1989 
season in need of a right fielder. But Washington? For three years? For $2.65 
million? 
</P>
<P>
At 34, Washington was easing into his role as a part-time starter. Too bad the 
Angels needed a full-timer. Washington appeared in only 110 games in 1989 and 
left the team stranded in early September when he bolted a pivotal East Coast 
trip to return home for "personal reasons." (Translation: marital dispute.) The 
Angels went 4-11 on the trip and never recovered. Neither did Washington. After 
two charges of spousal battery in early 1990, Washington took his problems back 
to New York last month. Grade: C- 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
1990 
</P>
<P>
Signed Mark Langston as a free agent. He struck out with Nolan Ryan. He struck 
out with Bruce Hurst. One winter later, Port was scrambling for a free-agent 
score -- and Langston was it, cost be damned. 
</P>
<P>
For $16 million, Port got the best pitcher on the free-agent board. Never mind 
Langston's so-so start in 1990; it was the right move at the time. It was 
designed to give the Angels the deepest starting rotation in the division and 
give Port the wherewithal to swing another deal and correct the club's more 
pressing needs on offense. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the rotation still looks good. Grade: A- 
</P>
<P>
Traded Jeff Manto and Colin Charland to Cleveland for Scott Bailes. And for 
Port's next trick . . . 
</P>
<P>
This wasn't the move the Angels needed, or expected, after Langston, but it has 
helped sustain the bullpen during the disablement of Greg Minton and Bob 
McClure. Charland, 5-10 at Edmonton in 1989, never showed much in two trips to 
the Angels' spring camp, and Manto, who had 23 homers and nearly as many errors 
at Edmonton, was a young designated hitter in a system that has cornered the 
market on old ones. Grade: B 
</P>
<P>
Traded Claudell Washington and Rich Monteleone to the New York Yankees for Luis 
Polonia. Because Port wouldn't part with Kirk McCaskill -- the reported asking 
price for Raines, Dykstra, Burks or Von Hayes -- Polonia became the temporary 
solution in the Angels' never-ending search for a leadoff hitter. Polonia is 
about as close to Rickey Henderson as the Angels are likely to get; he was one 
of the three players Oakland traded to the Yankees for Henderson last June. 
Grade: B 
</P>
<P>
Traded Mike Witt to the Yankees for Dave Winfield. Looking better each day Witt 
spends on the disabled list, but this may be the ultimate case of too little 
too late. By the time Winfield became an Angel, he was 38, recovering from back 
surgery and no longer an All-Star force in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Port had to wait six extra days before Winfield agreed to the deal, resulting 
in Port's recent filing of a grievance over the Yankees' alleged mishandling of 
the transaction. Among George Steinbrenner's reported sins: Trying to talk Port 
out of Winfield and into accepting Roberto Kelly instead. 
</P>
<P>
So what's wrong with Roberto Kelly? Grade: B 
</P>
<P>
And from Port, a self-assessment: 
</P>
<P>
"I don't regret any of them," he said. "I believe each of them was the right 
thing to do at the time, for the good of the California Angel organization. I 
think we came out with a fair return on every trade we made. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And I submit that the scorecard would read much differently if we hadn't taken 
as much care and just started casting names about. I could have made 110 deals. 
But when you proceed at too great a speed, accidents happen." 
</P>
<P>
And when you proceed too slowly, you get passed by Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
In the game of body bartering, a game Port does not enjoy, he has played it 
safe. He has played not to lose, and at that he has succeeded. Seldom does Port 
hurt the Angels when he makes a trade. Sometimes, he even helps them. 
</P>
<P>
Port's overall grade is a B.

NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
* Hurting Hurst: Left-hander Bruce Hurst of the San Diego Padres has averaged 
16 victories over the last three years and was 15-11 with a 2.89 earned-run 
average last year, but he is now 4-7 with a 4.67 ERA, has totalled only 5 1/3 
innings in his last two starts and has a 6.11 ERA for nine starts since 
pitching his only complete game May 12. 
</P>
<P>
"He gets down on himself very easily and has lost his confidence," pitching 
coach Pat Dobson said. "You put pressure on yourself and it becomes a domino 
effect. Before you know it, you're fried before you start." 
</P>
<P>
* Another Frying: Alan Anderson of the Minnesota Twins is experiencing a 
similar siege. Anderson was the American League's ERA leader at 2.45 in 1988, 
won 17 games last year and is now 2-10, has won only once since April 14 and 
has allowed nine or more hits in each of his last five starts. 
</P>
<P>
Said outfielder Dan Gladden, a frustrated pitching coach: "Maybe Alan Anderson 
should try a little Vaseline." 
</P>
<P>
* Back in Stride: Matt Nokes hit 32 home runs as a Detroit Tiger rookie in 
1987, then slipped to 16 in '88 and nine last year when his season ended in 
early June because of a knee injury. Nokes was recently traded to the New York 
Yankees and hit four home runs in his first 48 at-bats after hitting three with 
the Tigers in 111. Nokes credited the Yankees' hiring of former Detroit 
teammate Darrell Evans as batting coach, explaining that Evans quickly saw that 
he was overstriding. 
</P>
<P>
"In '87, when I hit all those home runs, he hit in front of me," Nokes said. 
"It's hard to explain, but it was like we were on the same wave length. He 
would hit a home run and I could see how he did it, then more often than not 
I'd hit one." 
</P>
<P>
* St. Louis Blues: The Cardinals arrived in Los Angeles 11th in the National 
League in team batting, 12th in runs and home runs, 10th in team pitching and 
12th and last in number of times being hit by pitch.

LETTING PARKER GET AWAY WAS A MISTAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reflecting the market and a commitment to retaining the nucleus of their 
championship team, the Oakland Athletics' player payroll has risen from $11.5 
million in 1988 to almost $21 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
And, adding in only the increased guarantees to the recently signed Jose 
Canseco, Rickey Henderson, Dave Stewart, Dennis Eckersley, Rick Honeycutt and 
Gene Nelson, the 1991 payroll is certain to approach a record $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
But with all of that, the A's might have been penny safe and 230 pounds foolish 
last winter when they refused to meet the multiyear demands of Dave Parker, who 
left as a free agent and got a two-year guarantee of $2,625,000 from the 
Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
Parker, at 39, is in the midst of a most-valuable-player-type season. 
</P>
<P>
He was fourth in the American League with a .330 batting average through 
Thursday, tied for fourth in runs batted in with 50, had nine home runs and had 
proven to be a catalytic influence on Gary Sheffield, a rookie disappointment 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Parker's roll included a second inning single off the New York Yankees' Jimmy 
Jones Tuesday night, his 2,500th hit. Robin Yount and George Brett are the only 
other active players with that many, and Parker said he is confident that he 
will be able to play three more years and reach 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I've sort of come full circle," he said. "Early in my career I was 
controversial and called a rebel. Now they say I'm a father figure, a positive 
influence. Three thousand hits would make all the statements that need to be 
made about Dave Parker." 
</P>
<P>
Parker batted .264, hit 22 homers and drove in 97 runs as the A's designated 
hitter last year. Through Thursday, Oakland designated hitters, primarily Felix 
Jose, Doug Jennings and Ken Phelps, who was recently sold to the Cleveland 
Indians, were batting .223 with six home runs and 37 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got all those right-handed hitters and thought they could get along 
without me," said Parker, who bats left-handed. "Maybe they're finding out that 
they can't." 
</P>
<P>
The predominantly right-handed hitting A's are third in the league in runs 
scored and 35-22 against right-handed pitching. When Canseco is in the lineup 
and they are at full strength physically, it generally doesn't matter from 
which side the pitcher throws. But when Canseco is sidelined, when the lineup 
is less than 100%, the A's have been vulnerable to right-handed pitching, a 
situation compounded by the absence of a left-handed DH with reliable power. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sandy Alderson, the A's general manager: "A healthy Jose alleviates 
whatever worry we have about the DH, but without him it creates more pressure 
on the rest of the lineup, meaning we can't afford weakness in the fifth and 
sixth position, where the DH is normally found. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see more production out of our designated hitters, but when you're 
third or fourth in the league in runs, I wouldn't say it's a terrible problem." 
</P>
<P>
Neither would he say that he was surprised by Parker's performance or that the 
A's had erred in allowing him to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes a change of scenery helps, and in Dave's case he seems to thrive on 
it," Alderson said. "He responded when he came to Oakland and he has responded 
in Milwaukee. Would he be having the same season if he was still with us? Who 
knows? 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, it's easy to say, 'I wish we had done this or that,' but we were faced 
with three choices, not one, and it's still not clear to me which of the three 
I would change if I could." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Parker, pitcher Storm Davis and infielder Tony Phillips were allowed to 
leave as free agents. At the time, Alderson said, the A's considered Davis the 
most critical loss. In spring training, he said, some made it seem as if the 
A's would miss the versatile Phillips the most. Now, he added, "the 
revisionists say we should have signed Parker." 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line, Alderson said, was the bottom line. The A's, realizing what 
they would have to give their superstars, had to make economic decisions that 
left room for the development of young players, such as Felix Jose and his 
comparatively modest salary. 
</P>
<P>
"The thought of a $30-million payroll is real scary, particularly in a market 
of our size," Alderson said. "It represents our limit, a squeeze on our ability 
to continue to field a competitive team. The way the economics are, you have to 
develop young players. I mean, I used to say that we could no longer afford a 
million-dollar player at every position. Now I have to say that we can no 
longer afford a $3-million player at every position." 
</P>
<P>
The A's ledger still isn't complete. Bob Welch, having his best season, is 
eligible for free agency when it ends and will be looking for more than his 
current $1-million salary. Mark McGwire, now earning $1.5 million, is bound to 
go to $2 million, and Henderson, who agreed to $12 million for four years in 
November and has since seen 10 players sign contracts for average annual 
salaries of more than $3 million, can be counted on to renegotiate. 
</P>
<P>
How long will Canseco's five-year, $23.5-million package stay the biggest? 
Canseco thinks it will stand for the life of the contract, although three top 
players -- Len Dykstra, Bobby Bonilla and Darryl Strawberry -- opened 
negotiations with their clubs this week: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dykstra, agent Alan Meersand said, is seeking a four-year deal with the 
Philadelphia Phillies that would put him on a par with Henderson and other top 
leadoff hitters and center fielders, a category in which management has said 
Dykstra belongs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bonilla, agent Dennis Gilbert implied, is looking for a Will Clark-type 
contract, four years at $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Bobby means to Pittsburgh what Clark means to San Francisco, but he doesn't 
have the luxury of Kevin Mitchell batting behind him," said Gilbert, who also 
represents Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert flew to Pittsburgh the other day at the Pirates' invitation, but when 
he was not even given a proposal by the club, Bonilla asked to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
The situation probably can be resolved, although Bonilla, back at his original 
position in the outfield, carries the memory of a bitter defeat in arbitration, 
where he heard the club castigate his fielding at third base. That was an alien 
position but he had moved there as a favor to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Strawberry, through agent Eric Goldschmidt, is pursuing a five-year 
contract "similar to Canseco's." The timing was right for an initial contact 
with New York Met Vice President Al Harazin. The Mets are playing to their 
potential under Bud Harrelson, no one more so than Strawberry, who had a 
17-game hitting streak through Thursday and had hit 11 home runs and driven in 
29 over his last 27 games. 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry, rebounding from his rehabilitation for alcoholism, said he is at 
peace with the idea of remaining in New York. He can build a case for matching 
Canseco around their similar home run and RBI career ratios. Canseco has a home 
run every 16 at-bats and an RBI every 4.98. Strawberry has a home run every 
15.6 at-bats and an RBI every 5.38. 
</P>
<P>
"What's Canseco done that some of us others haven't?" Strawberry said. "He's a 
great player, I agree. He had that 40-40 (steals and home runs) year, but I had 
a 30-30, and I'm on my way to another great year. You'd have to put us in the 
same category."

<TEXT>
<P>
Call it the Hand of God, or call it a twist of fate -- by any name there has 
been something unearthly guiding Argentina to the semifinals of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The defending champions overcame heat, humidity and their own failings for a 
0-0 (3-2) victory over Yugoslavia on penalty kicks Saturday before 38,971 at 
Florence Municipal Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The near-100 degree heat, coupled with about 50% humidity, sapped any hope that 
the game would produce the creative, explosive soccer the teams are capable of 
exhibiting. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, after playing to a draw through 90 minutes of regulation and two 
15-minute overtime periods, the players seemed to have difficulty summoning 
enough energy to kick the ball past the goalkeepers during the penalty kicks. 
While under normal circumstances a penalty kick is virtually certain to go in, 
in Saturday's match only half of the 10 shots found the back of the net. 
</P>
<P>
Argentina prevailed, again almost inexplicably. The team got into this game by 
beating Brazil in overtime, a game in which Brazil clearly was superior. 
Argentina will play Italy, a 1-0 winner over Ireland, in Naples on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Argentine players had only 20 days together to prepare for the World Cup. 
No sooner did they assemble than most key players suffered injuries. The whole 
of Argentina was held at rapt attention until it was determined that a blister 
on a toe of star Diego Maradona would not keep their national treasure from 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the dramatic script the South Americans have written for 
themselves, the hero of Saturday's game, goalkeeper Sergio Goycochea, was 
himself the backhanded beneficiary of his team's bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
After losing their first game to Cameroon, Argentina played the Soviet Union. 
Barely a few minutes into that game Argentine goalkeeper Nery Pumpido suffered 
a broken leg. Goycochea replaced him and has given up only one goal since. 
</P>
<P>
Goycochea's diving saves of Yugoslavia's last two penalty kicks gave Argentina 
the victory, rendering irrelevant the misses of teammates: Maradona's muffed 
left-footed chip shot and Pedro Troglio's hard shot that hit the right post. 
</P>
<P>
Maradona should have gained an advantage when the player marking him, Refik 
Sabanadzovic, was expelled from the match in the 31st minute. Sabanadzovic, who 
pledged to play Maradona closely but cleanly, was given a yellow card for a 
rough tackle and then another for dissent. 
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslavs pulled a midfielder off the attack to mark Maradona, but even 
playing a man short the rest of the game they hardly slacked their pace. 
Yugoslavia, which had the best qualifying record of any of the 13 European 
teams in the tournament, had three clear scoring chances in the first half to 
Argentina's none. 
</P>
<P>
The man busily creating Yugoslavia's chances was midfielder Dragan Stojkovic. 
Stojkovic is called the Maradona of the Carpathians because of his mastery of 
the ball and his deceptive moves. To these comparisons Stojkovic has always 
demurred. 
</P>
<P>
After Saturday's game, future comparisons will not be far-fetched. Stojkovic, 
who will play in the French first division next season, was simply the best 
player on the field. 
</P>
<P>
Stojkovic further resembled Maradona when he, too, missed his penalty kick by 
banging a shot off the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
But it is his hard work that is most impressive. While Stojkovic raced up the 
wings to jump-start Yugoslavia's swift counterattack, Argentina seemed content 
to slog away in the midfield. The Argentines held to this conservative approach 
even with the man advantage. It created few chances, although Maradona did get 
his second shot on goal of the tournament in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Maradona, as has been the norm in the tournament, was the game's most-fouled 
player with six, further hampering his ability to maneuver. Maradona's 
predicament is made worse by his teammate's listless play. Argentina's coach, 
Carlos Bilardo, has characterized his team as being "Maradona and 10 others;" 
it appears that Bilardo's harsh assessment is stinging in its accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Argentina wins, and that counts for far more than the fitfully brilliant 
play of teams such as Brazil, Yugoslavia and the Netherlands -- all of which 
have been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Often, how Argentina wins is bizarre. Toward the end of the second overtime it 
appeared that Argentina scored a goal. In the midst of its celebration, the 
referee ruled a hand ball by Jorge Luis Burruchaga. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the advantage of a televised replay, it was difficult to determine 
exactly where the ball hit the Argentine player. Yugoslav goalkeeper Tomislav 
Ivkovic made a diving save and tipped the ball, appearing to hit Burruchaga in 
the upper chest. The ball dribbled into the goal. 
</P>
<P>
Argentina made up for that with its superior penalty kicks, which the Yugoslav 
coach attributed to nothing more than good luck. 
</P>
<P>
Maradona, who is at once a superstitious and deeply religious man, agrees that 
luck is with his limping, fading, come-from-behind team. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I think (luck) has been with us," Maradona said, his swollen left ankle 
swathed in ice bags and his head encircled with a red headband. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) it is not as if any gifts have been given away. We want to show that 
Argentina is doing its best. We've got to win."

<P>
The World Cup soccer extravaganza called Italia '90 is roaring toward its 
climax here to rapt international attention and a television audience on five 
continents measured in the billions. 
</P>
<P>
A willing but unable American team, making the first United States Cup 
appearance in 40 years, has long since departed. The Americans, though, had the 
only team already qualified to play in the next edition of the world's most 
popular sports tournament. As host country of the 1994 World Cup, the United 
States qualifies automatically as one of the final 24 teams. 
</P>
<P>
As Italy is discovering this summer, amid some travail but mostly triumph, the 
coveted Cup sponsor's role is a unique opportunity. More than just a sporting 
event and commercial bonanza, the 1994 World Cup will be a chance to offer a 
broad, revealing glimpse of the real America to an international audience 
weaned on Hollywood superficiality. 
</P>
<P>
Success, directly involving the cream of American business and at least a dozen 
of the more than 30 cities vying to be 1994 game sites, ought to become a 
national commitment. 
</P>
<P>
The ability of the United States to effectively stage the next Cup is 
unquestioned. The danger, though, is that the 1994 Cup will be technically 
perfect but artistically empty when the American team steps onto the field. 
There is every prospect, alas, that the United States again will be the doormat 
of Cup play. 
</P>
<P>
As their performance here demonstrated, the Americans are a generation behind 
the rest of the world in competitive professional soccer. There is skill, and 
there is will among the young American players. But there is no way they can 
catch up in a country such as the United States without a professional league 
in which to hone and extend their talents. 
</P>
<P>
They have already gone about as far as the anemic structure of American 
professional soccer will allow. Even if -- against all odds -- a high-quality 
soccer league were to spring full blown in the United States tomorrow, there is 
no way it could be good enough soon enough to make the American team 
competitive in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
It will take prompt initiative, more than a dash of audacity -- and a little 
help from our friends -- to avoid a sad-sack replay. But it can be done. 
</P>
<P>
America's dedicated young players deserve a chance to show us, themselves, and 
the world in 1994, how good they could become. 
</P>
<P>
If there is nowhere for young Americans to grow at home, then Mohammed must go 
to the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
Two mountains, in fact, both soccer-tall, both friendly, both with a lot to 
teach. 
</P>
<P>
One is Italy, the other is Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
They play some of the world's best soccer, as different as samba and opera in 
their purest forms, but winsome in either. 
</P>
<P>
They are also special friends of the United States of whom we could unabashedly 
ask a favor in our interest, and theirs. Both are bound to be major characters 
in the USA '94, both are likely to be pleased by the compliment implied by the 
request, and the pride of authorship of its potential result. 
</P>
<P>
Here's what we should do: 
</P>
<P>
Let the United States enroll one team of America's most promising players, the 
kernel of the 1994 Cup team, as an exhibition squad in the Italian second 
division, and another in a Brazilian second division. That is not asking to be 
admitted without credentials to the major league -- the first division -- but 
to the high minors, where the quality of soccer is good and American all-star 
teams would be immediately competitive. 
</P>
<P>
Players on the teams would be paid honorable salaries by the U.S. Soccer 
Federation in collaboration with the corporate sponsors of the 1994 cup. 
U.S.-based multinationals are prominent among the Italia '90 sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
The American teams, led by two world-class coaches, and based, say, at a soccer 
ranch in Sao Paulo state, and a soccer farm in Umbria, would play a regular 
league schedule, two tough games a week. The results would not count in league 
play. 
</P>
<P>
Any money the games generated would go to the local clubs, or to their leagues. 
Besides the novelty of having soccer-hungry Americans in their midst, that 
would help make it worthwhile for the teaching teams to play an extra game or 
two a season. 
</P>
<P>
The American teams would abide by all rules of the league with the exception of 
having total control of their rosters. If an American player drew an offer from 
a European or South American club, he would be immediately released and his 
spot filled by a fresh recruit from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
When the Americans were not playing league games, they would be playing 
intra-squad at a facility dedicated to soccer and stocked with new talent as 
some players left and others arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Between times, if they became good enough, the overseas Americans could 
barnstorm through the European and South American heartland of professional 
soccer. There are many games to be lost, and perhaps some to be won, but every 
one would be a positive step toward 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Who knows? When the "Brazilians" and the "Italians" came back to the United 
States to play against down-home teams and one another, Americans might even go 
out to watch the results of such an provocative experiment. 
</P>
<P>
Let's get moving now. Letting a friendly international connection help make 
America competitive on the field in 1994 will take dynamism, organization, and 
a sure diplomatic hand to overcome the murmur of lawyers and the whining of the 
it's-never-been-tried-befores. 
</P>
<P>
Who could get the ball rolling? 
</P>
<P>
Henry Kissinger could. 
</P>
<P>
Kissinger is a to-his-roots soccer fan, a columnist for this newspaper at 
Italia '90, and a major reason that the United States will be the host country 
for the 1994 tournament. A guest of FIFA, the international soccer federation, 
Kissinger is hopscotching his way through Italian stadiums en route to the Cup 
final in Rome July 8. 
</P>
<P>
Kissinger has the access. He has the know-how. The iron will never be hotter. 
Just as Italia '90 is this summer, USA '94 should be a great show for the 
world. But who wants to come to a party at which the hosts are inept?

ENGLISH ARE CONFIDENT DESPITE THEIR INJURIES; 
</P>
<P>
QUARTERFINALS: CAMEROON APPEARS TO BE IN EVEN DEEPER TROUBLE BECAUSE OF 
SUSPENSIONS OF FOUR OF ITS STARTERS.

<TEXT>
<P>
English striker Gary Lineker, the top scorer in the 1986 tournament in Mexico, 
has only one goal in this World Cup and is hobbled by an injured toe. 
</P>
<P>
Winger John Barnes, England's player of the year, has a strained groin muscle. 
Defender Des Walker has injuries to both his left calf and ankle. Defender Paul 
Parker is nursing a shin injury. 
</P>
<P>
So why is England Coach Bobby Robson so confident that tonight's quarterfinal 
match at San Paolo Stadium is nothing more than a formality on the road to the 
semifinals? 
</P>
<P>
Because, unlike 1986, when England lost to Argentina in the quarterfinals, 
tonight's opponent is Cameroon, a team whose Siberian coach, Valery 
Nepomnyachy, has more than a few problems of his own. 
</P>
<P>
Nepomnyachy has lost four of his 11 starters to suspension. Making matters 
worse, Roger Milla, the scorer of four of Cameroon's five goals in the World 
Cup, injured his right shoulder in training Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I still feel stiff down my right side," Milla, 38, said, "but I'll be able to 
play." 
</P>
<P>
Nepomnyachy said earlier that the bench was not Cameroon's strong suit and that 
it would be difficult to replace the missing starters. 
</P>
<P>
"We must not let England play as it wants to. We must impose our game, at our 
pace," he said. "It's important to wait until they (the English players) make a 
mistake. Everyone makes mistakes during a match. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually say my team has a 50-50 chance of winning, but it has a 40-60 chance 
against England." 
</P>
<P>
Robson, meanwhile, talked about "a wave of optimism" in the English camp, a 
belief that both the injuries and Cameroon can be overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Lineker, however, remains cautious. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no foregone conclusions in this World Cup," he said. "That's been 
shown from day one." 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, was when Cameroon upset Argentina, the reigning world 
champion. Already, Cameroon has done better than any previous African team in 
the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
En route to the quarterfinals, Cameroon defeated Argentina, Romania and 
Colombia and lost to the Soviet Union. It has scored five goals and given up 
six. England, by contrast, tied Ireland and the Netherlands and defeated Egypt 
and Belgium. It has scored three goals and given up only one. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from Milla, who is unlikely to start but will come off the bench when 
needed, Cameroon's most dangerous player is Omam Biyik, whose speed could cause 
the English defense problems. England has struggled to find the net in this 
tournament and the player charged with creating the openings, midfielder Paul 
Gascoigne, has been inconsistent. He has also received a yellow card, meaning 
that one more will knock him out of the semifinal should England advance. 
</P>
<P>
Two other English players, winger Peter Beardsley and midfielder Steve McMahon, 
face a similar situation. For Cameroon, Milla and goalkeeper Thomas Nkono have 
yellow cards. 
</P>
<P>
On the English hooligan front, meanwhile, Naples has taken several steps to 
cope with any potential problems. The sale of alcohol has been banned from 3 
p.m. Saturday until 7 a.m. Monday, not just in the city but throughout the 
surrounding province. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, 2,000 police and soldiers will be on duty at the stadium tonight 
and another 3,000 throughout the city, especially at such gathering spots as 
Capodichino Airport, the four railways stations and the ferry port. 
</P>
<P>
Fans of Napoli, the Italian League champion, have said they would welcome true 
English supporters and accompany them to the stadium, and police have supported 
the idea.

CZECHS NEXT HURDLE FOR WEST GERMANS;

VICTORY IN TODAY'S MATCHUP.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Castle Caseglia is a 13th-Century fortress near Lake Como in the Lombardy 
region of Italy that was built as protection against Germany's Frederick the 
Great. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, it has served as shelter for another imposing invader from the 
north, West Germany's soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a lapse of concentration in a 1-1 first-round tie against Colombia, 
a game that was significant only for the Colombians, the West Germans have been 
one of the World Cup's two most impressive teams. 
</P>
<P>
The other is Italy. All but ignoring today's quarterfinal game here at Giuseppi 
Meazza Stadium against Czechoslovakia, West German Coach Franz Beckenbauer 
boldly predicted last week that his team will meet the Italians in the July 8 
final in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
It could be a perfect match of strength against strength. While Italy has 
dominated with its defense, having given up no goals in five games. West 
Germany has been overpowering with its offense. 
</P>
<P>
In a tournament that has produced an average of 2.27 goals a game, the West 
Germans have averaged three goals a game. Their 12 goals lead the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Czechs have not received as much attention as the Germans, they 
have quietly unleashed an attack that is almost as potent with 10 goals. 
</P>
<P>
They also have the tournament's leading scorer, striker Tomas Skuhravy, who has 
five goals. For that, his teammates have nicknamed him "Rambo." 
</P>
<P>
His bank account also more closely resembles Sylvester Stallone's than it did 
before the tournament. He became Czechoslovakia's first million-dollar player 
last week by signing a contract with an Italian League team in Genoa. 
</P>
<P>
The West Germans are more balanced in both Italian League millionaires and 
scorers. Forwards Rudi Voeller of AC Roma and Juergen Klinsmann of Inter-Milan 
each have three goals, and midfielder Lothar Matthaeus of Inter-Milan has two. 
</P>
<P>
Together, the West Germans and Czechs have scored 22 goals, the same as the 
other six quarterfinalists combined scored in the first and second rounds. 
</P>
<P>
That, however, does not necessarily guarantee that today's game will be high 
scoring. When these teams met the last week of May in an exhibition game, the 
West Germans won, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
The intensity of the World Cup playoffs also is such that every goal is 
precious. Teams that score first often tend to collapse into defensive shells 
to protect leads. 
</P>
<P>
There also is the possibility that the Czechs are not as overpowering as their 
results indicate. They scored nine goals against two teams, the United States 
and Costa Rica, that are from the world's least-respected region. Skuhravy 
scored all of his goals in those games. 
</P>
<P>
In games against better teams, Italy and Austria, the Czechs had more 
difficulty finding the net. They beat Austria, 1-0, and lost to Italy, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
The West Germans will play today without Voeller, who received an automatic 
one-game suspension along with the red card he was handed in the 2-1 
second-round victory over the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
However, the West German depth is evident. Beckenbauer is expected to replace 
Voeller with Karl Heinz Riedle of Werder Bremen, the leading scorer in this 
year's European Union of Assn. Football Cup. No wonder the West German coach 
seems confident.

The first time 21-year-old Karin Kschwendt met Martina Navratilova was shortly 
before they went out on the court Saturday to play their third-round match. 
</P>
<P>
"My heart was booming," said Kschwendt, the first player from Luxembourg to 
compete at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova won, 6-1, 6-1, and advanced to the quarterfinals against Judith 
Weisner of Austria, who defeated Laura Gildemeister of Peru, 6-2, 7-6 (7-5). 
</P>
<P>
Kschwendt went quickly, in 44 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good my parents did not come," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova scouted Kschwendt's second-round match so she knew what Kschwendt 
looked like. Kschwendt already knew what Navratilova looked like, but she 
wasn't prepared for how she felt to see her in person. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew her so well from TV, but to meet her in real life, it's really scary," 
Kschwendt said. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth-seeded Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina received no scares in her 
third-round match with France's Catherine Tanvier, 6-4, 6-2. THOMAS BONK

TEMPEST CLOUD SCORES $37.40 UPSET TO GIVE SHOEMAKER HIS FIRST VICTORY AS A 
TRAINER

<P>
Seven starters into his training career, Bill Shoemaker picked up his first 
victory Saturday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Tempest Cloud, a 2-year-old daughter of Temperence Hill making her career 
debut, drew away in the stetch in the fourth race, beating favored Nice Assay 
by nearly three lengths. A 17-1 shot ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye, she returned 
$37.40, the same price Ferdinand paid when he gave Shoemaker his final Kentucky 
Derby victory in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"They tell me the first one is the toughest," Shoemaker said. "Now, we can go 
on from here. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew she could run. She had a 59 1/5 work that didn't show in the (Daily 
Racing) Form. But, I didn't know if she would break because she'd been kind of 
mediocre coming out of the gate. I was just hoping she would run a good race 
and she ran big." 
</P>
<P>
By rights, Shoemaker's first training victory should have come 15 days earlier. 
Barton Dene, who was making his first U.S. start, was third, barely beaten 
despite a troubled trip. Baldomero, also from Europe, had finished second in 
both of her outings. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured if they kept running well, that one of these days they're going to 
get there," he said. "This has to be as big a thrill as any of the big wins I 
had as a rider." 
</P>
<P>
Tempest Cloud, who was purchased in March for $60,000 at the California 
Thoroughbred Sale at Del Mar, is owned by a group that includes Shoemaker's 
wife, Cindy. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Mandella couldn't have asked for a better ending to the $214,600 
Beverly Hills Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Beautiful Melody and Reluctant Guest, the trainer's two entrants, finished in a 
dead heat. "It might be the one thing (Wayne) Lukas hasn't done," Mandella said 
jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
There had been six previous stakes dead heats at Hollywood Park, but never had 
the two horses involved been trained by the same person. 
</P>
<P>
To most observers, it looked as if Reluctant Guest had moved up to edge 
pacesetter Beautiful Melody, but the camera couldn't separate them. 
</P>
<P>
Covering the 1 1/8 miles on turf in 1:47, they finished almost two lengths in 
front of Stylish Star, the longest shot in the field at 12-1. Double Wedge, the 
2-1 favorite, was fourth, then came Coolawin and Nikishka. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive stakes victory for Reluctant Guest, a 4-year-old 
Hostage filly who obviously does her best work when she has plenty of time 
between her races. She had won the Wilshire Handicap at 17-1 May 6. 
</P>
<P>
Beautiful Melody, the beaten favorite in the Gamely, was earning her first 
added-money victory and she hasn't finished off the board in five grass 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"When it first happened, I thought Reluctant Guest had gotten up," Mandella 
said. "Watching the rerun, their heads were bobbing up and down so fast, I 
couldn't tell. 
</P>
<P>
"They both ran great. I couldn't be prouder of them. I did this to try to get 
back in the top of the trainer standings. I was starting to slip a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Both Robbie Davis, the rider of Reluctant Guest, and Kent Desormeaux, Beautiful 
Melody's companion, thought they had gotten beat. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping for a dead heat because I thought I was beat," Desormeaux said. 
"Mr. Mandella asked me to come away with my reins loose and my tail in the air 
to get her to slow down as much as possible. She's such a natural speed filly 
it was just a matter of nursing her home. I thought the wire would never come." 
</P>
<P>
Davis has now won three races in six tries with Reluctant Guest. "I thought I 
won it, but when I stood up, Kent's filly was right with me and I thought I had 
gotten beat." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to Stalwart Charger, confidence is something trainer Pico Perdomo 
isn't lacking. 
</P>
<P>
Perdomo has been singing the praises of the 3-year-old Stalwart gelding for 
several months and he feels good going into today's $160,100 Silver Screen 
Handicap at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Stalwart Charger hasn't let his trainer down. He has won three of four 
starts -- he was third, beaten by a neck in the other -- and was impressive 
winning the California Derby in his last start April 21 at Golden Gate Fields. 
</P>
<P>
After being pressed through some extremely fast splits -- 44 4/5 for the 
half-mile and 1:08 3/5 for six furlongs -- he kept finding more and won by a 
bit more than two lengths in 1:46 4/5 for the 1 1/8 miles. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any horse in the country could have beaten him that day," said 
Perdomo while watching Stalwart Charger school in the paddock Saturday 
afternoon. "He was at his peak that day. 
</P>
<P>
"He's doing super and he's fit as he can be for this race, but there's no 
question that he'll be even better for the Swaps (July 22). 
</P>
<P>
"I was confident from the first time I breezed him that he was different from 
any horse I've ever been around. He showed me right from the start he was 
something special and you know when you have something good." 
</P>
<P>
Laffit Pincay, who has been working owner Sidney Factor's horse recently, will 
be his rider for the first time in the Silver Screen, at 1 1/8 miles. Alex 
Solis rode Stalwart Charger in his first two races, then Roberto Gonzalez was 
aboard for his two victories up north. 
</P>
<P>
The other entrants in the Grade III race are Music Prospector, who was second 
in the California Derby before finishing a distant fourth in the Preakness; 
Kentucky Jazz; Big Bass, who will be adding blinkers; Toby Jug, and Warcraft, 
who returns to the dirt after disappointing as the favorite in the Cinema 
Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Might Be Right, who lost 20 of his first 21 races, turned things around in a 
big way in his first outing for trainer Bill Spawr. Claimed for $20,000 May 26, 
the 4-year-old Herculean colt beat allowance rivals while covering six furlongs 
in 1:08 4/5. The margin was 1 1/4 lengths over favored Candyman Bee and he was 
geared down in the final yards by Pat Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
Considering Might Be Right hadn't won since 1988, it seemed a strange claim by 
Spawr. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he had more ability than he'd shown, so I thought I'd take a shot," 
he said. "I think he'll improve off this race. I think he's a pretty good 
horse." 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Turn Tothe Past, a 3-year-old maiden making his second start, equaled the track 
record for seven furlongs when he won the sixth race in 1:20 4/5. A son of Turn

TREATS: FOR A TASTY WAY TO COOL DOWN, TRY A TAIWANESE SLUSH. THE PYRAMIDS OF 
SHAVED ICE ARE EXOTICALLY FLAVORED.

<P>
The iciest treat in town may be Shau May's Taiwanese slush. This small Chinese 
restaurant in Alhambra is named for a leading ice cream company in Taipei. The 
slush is a sort of Chinese sundae, except that a pyramid of finely shaved ice 
replaces the ice cream, and the "toppings" go on the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
These goodies are far removed from the nuts, cherries and whipped cream of the 
usual American sundae. Take your choice of sweet red or green beans, cooked 
oats, taro, boiled peanuts and tapioca pearls. Then move on to exotic jellies 
such as pale almond curd, dark grass jelly and shimmery, pale-yellow ai yu 
jelly, which Shau May has retitled "love jade." Fruits include longans and 
lychees along with peaches, pineapple and fruit cocktail. 
</P>
<P>
The woman behind the counter spoons your choices into a shallow dish, showers 
them with ice from a tall grinder and sweetens them with a ladle of syrup. For 
an extra 25 cents, she'll swirl condensed milk over the top. 
</P>
<P>
Shau May offers about 16 toppings, but owner-manager Charles Hu says you can 
find as many as 100 in Taiwan -- although not usually all in the same place. 
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan, this cool sweet is available all year, although its popularity 
increases in the summer. Its Chinese name, pao bin, means shaved ice. There is 
also a variation called honey bean ice, which consists of yellow beans cooked 
in honey or syrup and combined with fruits and ice. 
</P>
<P>
How would a Taiwanese compose a slush? Customer Carol Cho, a Taipei native 
working in Los Angeles, was spooning up a combination of red beans, oats, taro 
and rice balls. Another of her favorites is green beans, peanuts and rice balls 
or tapioca. The novice could ease into these exotic substances by combining red 
beans and almond curd with peaches and fruit cocktail. Pineapple, lychees and 
grass jelly is another possibility. And Asians sometimes opt for a simple dish 
of red beans, condensed milk and ice. 
</P>
<P>
Shau May gives customers a choice of any three "toppings" for $1.50 or four for 
$1.75. Open daily from 11 a.m. to midnight, the restaurant is located at 15 E. 
Valley Blvd., next to the Garfield Theater. 
</P>
<P>
If you can't get there, it's easy to make a Taiwanese slush at home. Pick up 
the common canned fruits in a supermarket, then go to a Chinese market for cans 
of longans, lychees, ai yu and grass jellies. Some markets even carry dry mixes 
for almond curd. The crucial equipment is an ice shaver that will produce fine, 
snow-like ice rather than granules. These are available in some Asian markets. 
</P>
<P>
The following recipe suggests suitable canned toppings and provides 
instructions for cooking the beans, making almond curd and sugar syrup. Place 
the ingredients in separate bowls, let guests make a choice, then pile on 
plenty of ice, add the syrup and milk. It's a formula guaranteed to send 
shivers up your spine.

BOUILLABAISSE: SOME LIKE IT COLD; 
</P>
<P>
FISH SOUP: THIS CHILLY VERSION IS MOLDED LIKE A SALAD. 
</P>

<P>
It's never too hot for bouillabaisse. When the temperature gets out of hand, 
you simply eat it cold. The idea comes from Michael Hutchings of Michael's 
Waterside in Santa Barbara, who makes a chilly version that is molded like a 
salad. 
</P>
<P>
Hutching's soup is not for quick-and-easy cooks. The procedures aren't 
difficult, but they require time and patience. An expert like Hutchings can 
prepare a rich fish aspic that sets naturally or with a little help from leaf 
gelatin, which most of us can't obtain. We've taken the frustration out of that 
step by adding enough ordinary gelatin to guarantee a perfect result. 
</P>
<P>
Hutchings sets off the mold with a vibrant tomato relish seasoned with 
licorice-tasting fennel. An infusion of saffron and white wine finishes off the 
rouille, the mayonnaise-like sauce that traditionally accompanies bouillabaisse 
along with crisp slices of French bread. 
</P>
<P>
WATERSIDE BOUILLABAISSE 
</P>
<P>
1 pound salmon fillet 
</P>
<P>
1 pound white sea bass 
</P>
<P>
1 pound snapper fillet 
</P>
<P>
1 pound choice of other fresh fish 
</P>
<P>
1 cup julienned carrots 
</P>
<P>
1 cup julienned leek 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
30 shrimp 
</P>
<P>
30 medium black mussels 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons lightly chopped fennel fronds 
</P>
<P>
Tomato Relish 
</P>
<P>
Sauce Rouille 
</P>
<P>
Lightly toasted sliced French bread 
</P>
<P>
Cut salmon, sea bass, snapper and selected fresh fish into 2-ounce portions. 
Steam each fish until just done, 3 to 6 minutes. Chill until completely cold. 
Blanch carrots, leek and fennel in salted water until crisp-tender. Drain and 
chill. 
</P>
<P>
Place layer of melted Fish Gelee in bottom of 3-quart bowl. Refrigerate until 
set. Arrange some of shrimp, mussels and fennel fronds in attractive pattern 
that will show when bouillabaisse is unmolded. Add another layer of gelee and 
chill until firm. Continue layering fish, shrimp, mussels, fennel, julienned 
vegetables and gelee until bowl is filled. Chill several hours or overnight. 
</P>
<P>
To serve, invert bowl on large chilled platter. Place hot cloth on bowl to 
release gelee, then remove bowl. Garnish with Tomato Relish. Pass Sauce Rouille 
and French bread. Makes 10 servings. 
</P>
<P>
Fish Gelee 
</P>
<P>
1/2 pound sea bass trimmings 
</P>

chopped. Add egg whites, basil, saffron and orange zest. Set aside 2 cups 
cooled Basic Fish Fumet. Combine chopped mixture with remaining fish fumet in 
large heavy bottomed saucepan. 
</P>
<P>
Season to taste with salt. Heat to slow boil. Reduce heat to slow simmer and 
cook at edge of burner 45 minutes. Skim as needed. Liquid should be clear. 
Carefully strain through cheesecloth. Soften gelatin in reserved fish fumet, 
then heat until dissolved. Stir into strained mixture. Makes 2 1/2 quarts.

cook, covered, until tender and transparent. Drain fish bones, chop in chunks 
and add to pot. Cook until no longer transparent. Add cold water, bring to boil 
and allow to boil vigorously. Skim off all foam until clear. 
</P>
<P>
Add garlic, thyme, bay leaf, parsley, peppercorns and vermouth. Reduce heat to 
medium simmer. Cook 20 to 30 minutes, skimming as needed. Strain by carefully 
ladling through fine sieve or tea towel. Makes about 3 quarts.

coffin of 16-year-old Jesus E. Diaz, an Artesia youth who was shot to death at 
a graduation party in Norwalk on June 22, at a funeral Thursday at Holy Family 
Roman Catholic Church in Artesia. More than 400 mourners attended, including 
longtime friend George Andrade, right, who wore a T-shirt that read "In Loving

latest incident between the Chivas and Barrio Norwalk gangs that feud across 
the Norwalk-Artesia border. "I know you have in your hearts remorse and

STATE GRANTS MONEY TO REBUILD AVALON'S ONLY SCHOOL GYM; 
</P>
<P>
CONSTRUCTION: PROJECT MONEY WILL COME OUT OF THE $80 MILLION IN BONDS APPROVED 
BY PRIMARY VOTERS. THE FACILITY WILL ALSO SERVE AS A COMMUNITY CENTER.

<TEXT>
<P>
After nearly two years of battling the bureaucracy, officials from Long Beach 
Unified School District and the city won state approval this week to rebuild 
Avalon's only gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
The city's old school gym was shut down in the fall of 1988 and eventually 
razed because of asbestos contamination. 
</P>
<P>
A state board Wednesday qualified a new gym for emergency funding out of an 
$80-million bond issue approved by voters in the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the gym, expected to cost $2.5 million, is scheduled to begin 
in late summer. The facility is to be ready for use for the 1991-92 school 
year, said Ron Bennett, assistant business manager for the Long Beach district, 
which includes the Avalon schools. 
</P>
<P>
Without a gym, school basketball team players last season had to practice 
outside, occasionally in the rain, and had to travel each weekend to the 
mainland for games. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of us got sick during the season. I hope they can get (the new gym) up 
before I graduate," said Angel Campbell, a high school sophomore who plays 
guard for the girls' varsity basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
The new gym will primarily serve students of Avalon Senior High School and 
Middle School, although younger children will also use it, said Jon Meyer, 
principal of all the Avalon schools. 
</P>
<P>
Replacing the gym has been a burning issue in this town of 2,700, where the 
facility served as a community gathering place. "In a city this small, 
everybody comes to a home basketball game," Meyer said. "It's a centerpiece for 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
The old gym was also host to varied social and cultural events, such as square 
dances, musical productions and local club meetings. 
</P>
<P>
More than a quarter of the city's population recently signed a petition asking 
that a gym be built, City Councilwoman Barbara Doutt said. She joined other 
city leaders in delivering the petition to key legislators and administrators 
in Sacramento this week. 
</P>
<P>
The project to build the gym has been plagued by delays since the California 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration ordered the old facility shut in 
1988. At first, the state agreed to pay for a gym that would have been smaller 
than the original. 
</P>
<P>
The plans approved this week, however, call for a 9,000-square-foot building, 
slightly larger than the old one, Meyer said. The structure is to be built on 
part of what is now a playground, not far from the old site, Meyer said. An 
outdoor basketball court exists on the grounds of the former gym. 
</P>
<P>
After the state approved the larger size, the project ran into more trouble 
this spring after the state received more school construction funding requests 
than it expected. The gym request initially was ranked low on the state's 
priority list. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to influence state officials, Avalon civic leaders and Long Beach school 
district officials traveled to Sacramento this week on behalf of the project. 
</P>
<P>
After the lobbying, the State Allocation Board voted to place the Avalon gym 
project on an emergency funding priority listing, despite a staff 
recommendation against the move, said Bruce Hancock, field service manager for 
the Office of Local Assistance, General Services. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is unusual for city officials to get involved with the internal 
business of a school district, the gym's prominence in town life prompted them 
to take an active role, Doutt said. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the city even offered to put up money for the gym, but the 
district declined the offer. 
</P>
<P>
The state decided to grant the project emergency funding because of Avalon's 
unique situation, said state Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael), who is on the 
allocation board. 
</P>
<P>
With another district, the state might have chosen to bus students to a nearby 
gym for practice and games, officials said. Avalon's isolation was the factor 
that swayed the board's decision, Greene said.

He was a big man, sprawled limply across a bed in a tiny back bedroom on 
Mentone Avenue. He just couldn't seem to stand up, he said. "When I lay down 
and tried to get up again, I couldn't," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The man looked at the two paramedics with bewilderment. Someone had pulled his 
T-shirt up over his stomach and loosened his belt, and his beefy arms lay 
lifelessly at his sides. "I can't move my legs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Thompson, a 15-year veteran of Pasadena's corps of paramedics, bent over 
the man, peering into his face like a detective searching for clues. Thompson's 
partner, Todd Witt, slapped some adhesive patches onto the man's chest. 
One-two-three-four-five, each patch was connected to a wire. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to check your heart now," Witt said. He switched on the Lifepak, a 
portable life-support machine. It began to beep regularly, and a graph of the 
patient's heartbeat began to unroll on a little screen. 
</P>
<P>
It was a fairly routine case, in the middle of the paramedics' hectic Wednesday 
shift. "We get many, many cases like it every week," Witt said, shortly after 
the ambulance had taken the man to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
By 8 Thursday morning, the end of their 24-hour shift, the two paramedics had 
handled 11 cases, charging along city streets in Rescue Ambulance 36, siren 
wailing and lights flashing, all over Northwest Pasadena. They had treated and 
transported, among others, two police officers hurt in a traffic accident, a 
man with a knife wound to the scalp, a child trapped in the chimney of a brick 
barbecue pit and a man knocked off his bicycle by a passing car. 
</P>
<P>
The Mentone Avenue patient was 64, had had three heart attacks and a stroke 
since 1972, and appeared to have lost some motor function on his left side. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably some sort of stroke," said Witt. "Maybe his pressure built up so 
high he burst a blood vessel in his head." 
</P>
<P>
Until recent years, paramedics were considered the city's heart attack team, 
equipped with hypodermics and portable defibrillators, racing to revive people 
in cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
"When I started with the city in 1975, the only thing we were expected to do 
was go out and take care of acute myocardial infarctions," said Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, paramedics handle almost any medical problem imaginable, including a 
lot of nuisance calls -- all of which they must hastily respond to. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city's three rescue ambulances, each staffed 24 hours a day by 
two paramedics, responded to almost 9,500 calls for help. That was about 700 
more than Glendale's privately contracted paramedic service, which has one more 
ambulance than Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
So fast and furious has become the pace of trauma and illness in Pasadena that, 
on an average of once a day, dispatchers must scour the region for private 
ambulances to answer calls because all three city paramedic units are tied up. 
</P>
<P>
Private ambulances aren't always immediately available, said Fire Chief Kaya 
Pekerol, whose department has been in charge of paramedics for five years. And 
when private ambulances do respond, they're not necessarily staffed by 
paramedics, who are trained to administer intravenous medicines or to operate 
such sophisticated equipment as the Lifepak. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like going back to the old scoop-and-run," said Pekerol, referring to a 
time when ambulances just picked up patients and raced them to emergency room 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
The city's Board of Directors this month will consider a Fire Department 
request for a fourth rescue ambulance. In a year when budget demands appear to 
be outpacing revenue, the board must consider whether to find an extra $300,000 
to $500,000 to staff the ambulance or risk further overburdening the city's 30 
paramedics. Three-quarters of the calls to the Fire Department for assistance 
are medical calls, a department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
But ambulance service is fast becoming one of the city's biggest uncollected 
bills. Last year, the city billed patients for almost $2 million worth of 
paramedic services but collected less than half of that amount. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that, as are other cities, Pasadena is feeling the effects of a 
gradual breakdown of the nation's health care system, said Director Rick Cole. 
"There's been a wave, a crushing wave, of people with no health insurance or 
inadequate health insurance showing up in hospital emergency rooms," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics no longer just provide emergency treatment, Cole added. They are now 
"the doctors of last resort" for a medically neglected segment of the 
population, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Rescue Ambulance 36, a red-and-white 1987 Chevrolet Silverado with 110,000 
miles on its odometer, operates out of a down-at-the-heels fire station on 
North Raymond Avenue. "Ft. Raymond," firefighters call the station, because of 
its isolation on the wild and woolly side of Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The ambulance is a marvel of modern medical technology, equipped with all of 
the latest life saving devices: defibrillator, laryngoscope, an array of heart 
medications and painkillers, and a radio to keep the paramedics in contact with 
doctors at Huntington Memorial Hospital emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics complain that the ambulance is often used just to take mildly ill 
people to hospitals. "Some people just see it as a red and white taxi with 
lights on it," said paramedic Mike Barilla, who staffed the ambulance on a 
recent Monday along with his partner Myron Cooper and trainee Robert Culhane. 
</P>
<P>
During their shift, an unusually tranquil one, the trio responded to a call for 
assistance to a woman with a "head injury." The paramedics found she had fallen 
in the hallway of her apartment building, bruising her knee. She elected not to 
go to the hospital after the paramedics examined her. 
</P>
<P>
Then they raced to a "stabbing" victim, a woman who had been jabbed in the arm 
with a table fork by her sister. They cleansed her small puncture wounds and 
returned to the station house. 
</P>
<P>
Such calls could represent an abuse of the system, Fire Capt. Lloyd Wade said. 
"Ten years ago, if a child broke his arm, his mother put him in the car and 
drove him to the hospital," Wade said. "Now, people call an ambulance." 
</P>
<P>
All paramedics have tales of wasted trips, which they can't refuse because of 
the possibility of exposing the city to lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a report of someone with difficulty breathing," said Wade. "You get to 
the place and there's a guy sitting on the edge of his bed, smoking a 
cigarette. You may have tied up two paramedics and three or four men from an 
engine company. Meanwhile, you've got an accident on the freeway or a shooting 
somewhere, and you've lost valuable time." 
</P>
<P>
Barilla told of responding to a "difficulty breathing" call recently and 
finding a woman with a head cold. "She said: 'Yeah, I have trouble. When I try 
to breathe through my nose, I have trouble breathing.' " 
</P>
<P>
But the life-and-death calls come frequently enough. Culhane, on just the third 
of 20 round-the-clock shifts he must complete to qualify as a paramedic, 
delivered a baby. Later, he and the two paramedics revived an elderly woman 
whose heart had stopped while she was being bathed in a nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
"That's when you really feel good," said Barilla, describing the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson and Witt felt similar gratification after they delivered the stroke 
victim to St. Luke Medical Center. It was one of those cases that had been 
mined with unpredictables. 
</P>
<P>
Unable to get their gurney into the patient's house, the two paramedics had to 
carry the man, a bulky 270-pounder, to the front yard. Thompson, who prides 
himself on being able to insert a hypodermic intravenously on a bumpy street at 
40 m.p.h., couldn't find a vein in the man's fleshy arm. Then, as Witt drove 
around a sharp curve, Thompson almost went sprawling across the patient. 
</P>
<P>
When the patient was safely in the care of emergency room physicians, the two 
paramedics headed back to the relative tranquillity of the fire station. When 
would they get the next in that endless succession of emergency calls? 
</P>
<P>
"The rule of thumb," Witt said cheerfully, "is that you expect it to come 
during lunch, during dinner or sometime after midnight." 
</P>

SAFE AND SANE FOURTH OF JULY PLANNED FOR WESTSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From arts and crafts and pony rides in Beverly Hills to body building and 
fireworks on the beaches, Westsiders will find a variety of safe and sane ways 
to celebrate the nation's 214th Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
In Culver City, the Fourth of July will be an international civic celebration 
of community service as well as a national day of patriotism. During the 
two-hour program beginning at 7:30 p.m. on Culver City High School's Helms 
Field, city officials will welcome the mayor of Lethbridge, Canada, the 
community's latest sister city. The Canadian and American flags will fly side 
by side as the Paul Bowman Million Dollar Country Western Band plays the 
national anthems of both countries to an expected 15,000 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
A 30-minute fireworks display at 9 p.m. will cap the program. Parking will be 
available in the high school parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
For those looking for something a little different, the Venice Beach Recreation 
Center will sponsor its annual open muscle contest starting at 11 a.m. at the 
site of the recently closed "Muscle Beach." 
</P>
<P>
A Dixieland jazz concert starts at 2 p.m., and a fireworks display will start 
at 9 p.m. Recommended for ideal viewing are sites along the beach as far north 
as Venice. 
</P>
<P>
In Pacific Palisades, more than 30,000 spectators are expected for the annual 
Fourth of July Parade. The parade, complete with floats and marching bands, 
will begin at 2 p.m. at Via De La Paz and Sunset Boulevard to Drummond Street 
and the Palisades Park. 
</P>
<P>
Later, at 7:30 p.m., there will be a fireworks display at the Palisades High 
School Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
There will not be a fireworks show in Beverly Hills, but there will be an 
activities fair with art and crafts for children and music from two Dixieland 
bands at Roxbury Park. The program runs from noon to 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
And for those who just can't wait for the Fourth, there are the Hollywood Bowl 
and Santa Monica's celebration. 
</P>
<P>
On July 2, 3 and 5, there will be music under the stars and a host of Walt 
Disney cartoon characters as part of Fourth of July celebrations at the 
Hollywood Bowl. The Los Angeles Philharmonic and other visiting bands and 
choirs will perform beginning at 8 each night. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, more than 200,000 early risers and patriots are expected for 
the 4:45 a.m. Dawn's Early Light Fourth of July Celebration. 
</P>
<P>
After a 30-minute fireworks show north of the pier, the 71-member L.A. Pops 
orchestra will give a concert at the end of the Pleasure Pier featuring 
traditional American marches and anthems, including selections from Aaron 
Copeland's "Rodeo" and John William's score from "Born on the Fourth of July." 
</P>
<P>
But for all the variety of celebrations, these events have one thing in common: 
They are legal and safe. All fireworks, including the Safe &amp; Sane brand, 
are illegal in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, Culver City and Santa Monica unless 
they are being used by professional pyrotechnists with a city permit.

GLENDORA JOINS INSURANCE POOL, ENDING TIES TO MAYOR'S FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The City Council voted last week to acquire insurance coverage through a 
26-city insurance pool, terminating policies obtained through brokerage firms 
co-owned by Mayor Bob Kuhn and a business partner. 
</P>
<P>
With its 3-0 vote to place worker's compensation and property insurance 
coverage with the Independent Cities Risk Management Authority, the council 
reversed an earlier decision to seek bids from different brokers. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Director Larry Schroeder already had requested bids from Independent 
Cities and Glendale Insurance Agency Inc. when the council voted May 23 to open 
the process to other brokers. 
</P>
<P>
The policies expired today, but since there was just over a month between the 
May vote and expiration, the council had decided to continue with the current 
brokers and get new bids effective in October. 
</P>
<P>
But the council voted Tuesday to go with the risk pool before any other bid 
requests were sent out to brokers. Councilwoman Molly MacLeod said the city 
would be penalized if it switched insurance carriers in October, the middle of 
a coverage year. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said the pool's rates are hard to beat. He likened them to volume 
discounts because several cities are seeking coverage together. Besides, he 
said, it takes a long time to get new quotes. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman David Bodley, who had made the motion to put the insurance out to 
bid, was on vacation and absent from Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The city's insurance practices and Kuhn's involvement are under review by the 
district attorney's office. The California Fair Political Practices Commission 
found no evidence of impropriety after an investigation in May. 
</P>
<P>
Kuhn, who co-owns Alandale Insurance Agency, a broker for the city since the 
1960s, abstained from voting in May and on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A Parks and Recreation Department policy brokered by Alandale will be canceled 
and placed with the insurance pool beginning today. Schroeder did not seek any 
new quotes from Alandale "to avoid any possible conflict of interest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city's policies, covering workers compensation and property, have been 
brokered through Glendale Insurance Agency Inc. Glendale is co-owned by Cleve 
Traughber, a co-owner of Alandale. 
</P>
<P>
But the 26-city pool submitted lower quotes to the city last month and will be 
taking over those coverages, also effective today. Schroeder said three other 
firms had expressed an interest in brokering the policies. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, the bulk of the city's insurance has been acquired through the 
pool.

TAX ISSUE RAISED IN CHABAD DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Turf wars" going public (Times, June 10) reach more members of the Jewish 
community than all the weekly Anglo-Jewish papers. It can prove to be an 
effective means of involving the overwhelming majority who are not affiliated 
with any Jewish organization or institution. (It's estimated there are 600,000 
Jews in greater Los Angeles.) Unless they know what's happening in "private" 
debates, they will remain passive when passion is needed to secure greater 
commitments. 
</P>
<P>
As to the Bayit-Chabad housing dispute, the legal question of ownership is 
secondary to community interests, organization and values. 
</P>
<P>
Bayit was created to serve the needs of college students who wanted to live on 
campus in an orthodox housing situation. The Jewish community, through private 
or its organizational instrumentalities, must help fund such programs. 
</P>
<P>
What's disturbing about the Chabad move is that their prime purpose is to 
secure commitments to their way of practicing and living Jewish life. Meeting 
the needs of those on drugs or homeless is not a distinctive "Jewish" problem. 
For those who look to Jewish sources for assistance, there is the Jewish Family 
Service. It crosses "religious" differences and practices, and does what Chabad 
and others must do if any public funding is involved, provide services to 
whomever comes to their door(s) for help. 
</P>
<P>
It's the latter (public funding from taxpayer dollars) that needs greater 
"public airing." 
</P>
<P>
Social welfare agencies must make their funding programs public; religious 
institutions do not. The exception is where public funds are given for a 
specific non-religious, social purpose. 
</P>
<P>
What is disturbing and potentially dangerous in terms of protection of minority 
interests and rights, is the growth of sectarian, religious agencies seeking 
taxpayer dollars, often masking their private interests by claiming the service 
provided is public. These nongovernmental expenses are a good part of our 
budget deficits and prone to excesses as there is not enough staff to 
adequately monitor these gifts and grants. 
</P>
<P>
As to the issue revealed in the June 10 story, I would hope Chabad will step 
aside and leave student housing with the campus authorities and the agencies 
created to handle the physical and spiritual needs of students.

JUDGE'S REMAP RULING PUTS 1ST DISTRICT RACE IN LIMBO; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: SARAH FLORES AND GREG O'BRIEN KNOW THEY'RE RUNNING FOR THE BOARD OF 
SUPERVISORS. WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW IS JUST WHAT THE DISTRICT THEY'RE SEEKING 
WILL CONTAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine running for office in a district whose boundaries are unclear, on an 
election day that could change, against opponents who remain unknown. 
</P>
<P>
That is the daunting prospect facing Sarah Flores and Greg O'Brien, candidates 
for the 1st District seat on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Flores, a former deputy to Supervisor Pete Schabarum, and O'Brien, a Superior 
Court judge, were the two top vote-getters in the June 5 election to replace 
the retiring Schabarum. Under normal circumstances, they would be preparing for 
a November runoff to see who would represent a district that includes much of 
the San Gabriel Valley and the southeast part of the county. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon threw their election plans into limbo a 
day before the primary when he ruled that the current supervisorial districts 
violate the federal Voting Rights Act by unfairly diluting the strength of 
Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Kenyon will preside over a hearing Thursday to review an alternative map of the 
supervisorial districts that was submitted last week by the county. If he 
doesn't like that plan, he could accept districts drawn by the American Civil 
Liberties Union and Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Or the 
judge could draw a map of his own. He must also decide whether to invalidate 
the primary and order a new election. 
</P>
<P>
Established politicians such as Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) and Los 
Angeles City Council members Gloria Molina and Richard Alatorre have said they 
are considering a run for supervisor in a new, predominantly Latino district. 
As conceived by the supervisors, that would be the 3rd District. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Kenyon could redraw the boundaries to place a majority of Latinos in 
the 1st District, which would, theoretically, make the race appealing to the 
powerful Latino politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Both Flores and O'Brien -- who live just 12 doors apart in Glendora, at the 
foot of the San Gabriel Mountains -- say they intend to run regardless of how 
the 1st District is redrawn. But sometimes they must struggle to buck up their 
spirits and to build enthusiasm for their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"If I sound down, I guess what is dominating my thoughts right now is that we 
may well be back into a primary," O'Brien said. "And then it would be April of 
1991 for the general election. . . . Good grief!" 
</P>
<P>
Flores said: "The hardest part is not knowing, trying to strategize and make 
several plans based on assumption and not knowledge. We will have to regroup 
and perhaps focus on cities we haven't focused on before." 
</P>
<P>
Flores finished on top of a 10-candidate primary field, with 34.69% of the 
vote, while O'Brien finished second with 20.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Both agreed that fund raising has been nearly impossible since Kenyon threw the 
validity of the primary result into doubt. 
</P>
<P>
With the backing of Supervisors Deane Dana and Mike Antonovich, Flores 
collected more than $400,000 before the primary, to top all other candidates. 
"We expected to raise another $100,000 from June 5, 1990, through June 19, 
1990," Flores wrote in a declaration to Kenyon. "Instead, we raised only $500." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, who raised about $300,000 in the primary, said he is collecting 
previous pledges but has temporarily stopped soliciting new contributions. 
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting because all the contributors are waiting to see what is 
happening," O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said in a declaration to Kenyon that the uncertainty surrounding the 
election has also "made it impossible for me to . . . generate enthusiasm among 
volunteers and voters." 
</P>
<P>
She wrote the judge that he should not invalidate the primary, because she is 
"within striking distance" of becoming the first Latino ever elected to the 
Board of Supervisors." 
</P>
<P>
Flores said she is seeking to consolidate her support with endorsements from 
local city officials.

DOO DAH BECOMING A SERIOUS BUSINESS FOR PARADE ORGANIZER 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In his office on the third floor of the YWCA, Peter Apanel is talking business. 
</P>
<P>
Profit margins. Corporate sponsorship. Advertising revenue. These are concepts 
to which the Apanel of 13 years ago, when he started the Doo Dah Parade, paid 
scant attention. 
</P>
<P>
But now, the self-proclaimed czar of the annual spoof of the Tournament of 
Roses is bowing to economic pressure. Disappointed after a lower-than-expected 
turnout at last November's event and weary of eking out a living on slim parade 
profits, Apanel has made a couple of business decisions. 
</P>
<P>
He's signed a three-year exclusive contract with KCOP Channel 13 to televise 
Doo Dah, a deal Apanel says will bring him $10,000 this November and $2,500 
more the two subsequent years. 
</P>
<P>
He also has found a corporate sponsor for the parade, which runs the Sunday 
after Thanksgiving. GTE California Inc. will pay for the $175-a-page cost of 
printing the Doo Dah program in exchange for advertising space and exposure of 
the company logo. Twenty percent of the ad revenue will go to a local nonprofit 
arts organization. 
</P>
<P>
This all may seem out of character for Doo Dah, which since its 1978 birth has 
been everything that the multimillion-dollar New Year's Day extravaganza isn't: 
eccentric, ridiculous, racy, anti-Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
Will going electronic and enlisting corporate sponsorship spoil Doo Dah's 
offbeat character? "Everybody's going to think I totally sold out," the 
39-year-old Apanel conceded, "but I can't do this for nothing anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Apanel estimates that Doo Dah parade-goers pour $100,000 into city businesses 
each year, assuming there are about 50,000 spectators who spend about $2 each. 
Gail Thompson, executive director of the Pasadena Convention &amp; Visitors 
Bureau, said her organization doesn't keep track of Doo Dah Parade-generated 
business, and Apanel's figures are probably conservative. 
</P>
<P>
But Apanel must pay the city for law enforcement, health department 
inspections, cleanup, and portable toilets. Last year's bill came to $11,747, 
said Cissy Schreiner, a senior accountant in Pasadena's Finance Department. 
</P>
<P>
Apanel said he ended up netting $12,000 from the $10 each participant pays and 
sales of T-shirts and other items. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, Doo Dah itself has become an establishment, inspiring people from 
New Jersey, Florida, Texas, and Pismo Beach to start their own spoof parades. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, people didn't like the Doo Dah Parade. Now, they love it," said Tom 
Behrens, a drummer for Snotty Scotty and the Hankies, a local band that has 
appeared in all 13 Pasadena Doo Dahs. "The Doo Dah will grow up and be like the 
Rose Parade, get established. A whole Tournament of Doo Dah, you know? Then we 
can do a spoof on that."

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: RENEWING LISTING WITH GOOD AGENT MAKES SENSE IN THIS 
SLOW MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BRUSS, Robert J. Bruss is a San Francisco-area lawyer, author and 
real estate broker. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: Starting in February, I tried to sell my home without an agent. That 
was a big mistake. But a friendly real estate agent kept bugging me, in a nice 
way, so I listed my home for sale with her for 30 days. She heavily advertised 
the house and held open houses almost every weekend, so I renewed the listing 
for 90 days. The agent tells me home sales are slow in our town and there are 
many listings. As my listing is about to expire, do you think I should renew? 
Also, what can I do to get my home sold? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Renew your listing. You need all the help you can get to sell your home 
in the slow buyer's market that prevails in most cities. That means there are 
more listings of homes for sale than there are qualified buyers. If your agent 
is doing a good job, stick with that agent. 
</P>
<P>
Please remember there is a buyer for every home. But that buyer will only 
purchase at his price and terms. 
</P>
<P>
To make your home stand out from the crowd of other homes in the multiple 
listing book, you've got to make your home especially attractive. One way is to 
offer it on a lease with option to purchase. Another way is to offer attractive 
seller financing terms. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, I am presuming your home is already in tiptop physical condition. If 
not, be sure to clean, paint and repair as necessary. Then price your home 
correctly. Please don't make the mistake of overpricing your home in hope a 
fool will overpay for it. That rarely happens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seller Liable If Home Isn't Up to Code 
</P>
<P>
Q: We contracted to buy what we thought was a three-bedroom home. But last week 
my husband went to city hall to learn what would be required to add a family 
room and a second bathroom. To his surprise he learned the third bedroom was 
added illegally without a building permit. 
</P>
<P>
To legalize the addition, the city will require complete inspection and 
possibly removing some of the walls to check the wiring. Do we have to go ahead 
with the purchase? If so, can we get the seller to pay for legalizing the 
addition? 
</P>
<P>
A: If the seller did not disclose the illegal addition -- and because you 
learned about it before the sale closed -- you need not complete the purchase 
because the property was misrepresented to you. The seller must refund your 
earnest money deposit if you elect to cancel the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Another alternative is to require the seller to either reduce the price by the 
amount of your damages or pay the costs of having the room addition legalized. 
</P>
<P>
Home improvements constructed without proper building permits and inspections 
can not only be dangerous, but they hurt the value and resale potential of the 
home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$175 Lien Holds Up Sale of $325,000 Home 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have contracted to buy a house for $325,000. Everything was going well 
until the title insurance company discovered a $175 judgment lien from a small 
claims court recorded against the seller. 
</P>
<P>
She claims the lien is not hers, but her name is very unusual, so I think the 
judgment is correct. Is there any way to close the sale while awaiting 
settlement of this little claim? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. It is usually possible to close the sale by having the closing 
settlement agent hold back an amount double the lien from the sales proceeds 
until the dispute is settled. Please consult the person who will be closing the 
sale, so a reasonable solution can be agreed upon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seller Not Moved Out on Closing Day 
</P>
<P>
Q: We were supposed to close the purchase of our home last Tuesday, but the 
seller had not yet moved out. The realty agent felt we should close the sale 
anyway. But my wife said we shouldn't start paying on our mortgage interest 
until we can move in. Now the real estate agent says we are in breach of 
contract if we don't close the sale. What do you advise we do? 
</P>
<P>
A: If the seller has a legitimate reason for not moving out of the house yet, 
you could close the sale, but hold back from the seller's proceeds for a 
month's rent at some outrageous rate, such as $100 per day. However, if the 
seller is just stalling and does not have a valid reason for delaying the 
closing, you may want to consult a real estate attorney about filing a lawsuit 
for specific performance of the purchase contract. In addition, the attorney 
will probably recommend recording a lis pendens against the property to prevent 
a sale to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Owner Should Get Security Deposit 
</P>
<P>
Q: I live in an apartment building that was recently sold. The new owner 
verified my rent and lease, but did not say anything about my $500 security 
deposit. I didn't lose my deposit when the building was sold, did I? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Sellers of buildings in which the tenants have security deposits are 
required to transfer those deposits to the new owner. However, just to be sure 
there is no misunderstanding as to the amount of your deposit, today would be a 
good time to write a certified letter with a return receipt to the new owner 
explaining you want to verify that your full $500 security deposit was 
transferred. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Prepay Loans When Interest Low 
</P>
<P>
Q: We have a first and second mortgage on our home. The first is a 7.5% 
interest rate. The second mortgage is at 9% and is held by the woman who sold 
the house to us. We can afford to prepay either mortgage. Which one should we 
pay off? 
</P>
<P>
A: Don't pay off that first mortgage, because of its low interest rate. As for 
the second mortgage, I wouldn't pay it off either, unless the lender will give 
you a discount for early payment. When you prepay a mortgage you are investing 
money at the loan's interest rate. Neither the 7.5% nor the 9% interest rate is 
a good investment. Instead of prepaying either loan, conserve your cash for 
emergencies or other investments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Seller Deduct VA Mortgage Fee? 
</P>
<P>
Q: That new $184,000 maximum VA mortgage amount is a mixed blessing. As a home 
seller, I was thrilled when a buyer offered me my full price for my home. 
However, then I learned it is my "privilege" to either pay the buyer's VA loan 
fee or reject that buyer. The realtor tells me it is against the law for the 
veteran to pay his loan fee. How stupid. But I decided it is worthwhile to me 
to get an all-cash sale, so I agreed to pay the loan fee. Can I deduct this fee 
on my tax returns? 
</P>
<P>
A: As the home seller, you can subtract the VA loan fee from the gross sales 
price of your home. I agree it is a stupid federal law that prohibits veterans 
from paying their own loan fee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interest Deduction Only If You Own Home 
</P>
<P>
Q: Since February I have been paying my father's mortgage payment because he is 
unable to work. It looks like he won't be able to return to work soon. Can I 
deduct the mortgage interest on my income tax returns? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Sorry, you cannot deduct the interest you pay on your father's mortgage 
unless you also are a co-owner of the property. If you hold title to the 
property and risk losing the property if you don't pay the mortgage, then you 
can deduct the mortgage interest you pay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agent Should Help Arrange Financing 
</P>
<P>
Q: About two weeks ago, our offer to buy a home was accepted by the seller. 
Then we asked the real estate agent for recommendations as to which mortgage 
companies are best for getting our home loan. He was not very helpful and acted 
as if it is our job to find a loan. Shouldn't the real estate agent help us 
obtain the best loan? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Smart agents know they can't sell a home unless they can finance it. 
Most realty agents are only too eager to recommend local real estate lenders 
who currently are offering the best home loan terms. Perhaps you can talk to 
the manager of the agent's office for assistance in obtaining the best 
available mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Equity Sharing Not Always a Good Move 
</P>
<P>
Q: I would like to invest in real estate, but don't have the time to deal with 
tenants. A local real estate broker has a plan whereby she will match an 
investor (such as me) who puts up the down payment with a resident who will 
make the monthly payments. We will split the profit in five years when the 
house is sold or refinanced. It sounds too good to be true. Is it? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Home equity sharing is authorized by Internal Revenue Code 280A. Both 
the non-resident investor and the resident co-owner must be on the title if 
they are to receive income tax deductions. 
</P>
<P>
The non-resident rents his share of the home to the resident who gets to deduct 
their portion of mortgage interest and property taxes on their share of the 
home. The co-owners agree after five or 10 years the property will be sold or 
refinanced with a split of the profits. 
</P>
<P>
This sounds like a good deal for both parties. It usually works very well 
between parents and their adult children where everyone knows and trusts each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
However, among strangers, equity sharing can lead to trouble. For example, 
suppose the resident co-owner quits making payments due to unemployment, 
illness, or divorce. How do you, the non-resident co-owner, get rid of a 
deadbeat co-owner? 
</P>
<P>
Since you can't evict them, if they resist, you will wind up in court. Some 
equity-sharing companies recommend pre-signed quit claim deeds or other 
devices, but they won't work if the resident co-owner gets a lawyer and fights 
to claim part of the equity. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to be more positive about equity sharing. But I've heard too many 
horror stories to be enthusiastic except between parents and their adult 
children where everyone has a family obligation to perform the equity-sharing 
contract as agreed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Protect Rights When Co-Owning Property 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am thinking of buying a house with my best friend. We were in college 
together, both are bachelors and have no immediate prospects of marriage. But 
we realize it is stupid to waste money on rent. We can each put up $20,000 for 
a down payment on a house we will buy together. It will be a very nice 
"bachelor pad." However, if one of us should get married or have an out-of-town 
job transfer, how should we provide for either selling the house or the 
remaining co-owner to buy the other out? 
</P>
<P>
A: Taking title as tenants in common is not enough. In addition, you need a 
contract which provides for contingencies such as a buyout agreement or the 
possibility that one co-owner must sell, but the other cannot afford to buy him 
out. Please consult an experienced real estate attorney who will draw up a 
co-ownership agreement which will provide for the possible problems which might 
arise.

No Time Limit on VA Mortgage Eligibility 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am a Korean War veteran who has never obtained a VA home loan. Am I still 
eligible for a VA mortgage? If so, can I use my eligibility to buy a vacation 
second home? What is the maximum VA mortgage? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. No. $184,000. There is no time limit for eligible veterans to obtain a 
VA home mortgage. However, the home must be the veteran's primary residence. 
The VA loan limit was recently raised to $184,000. For further details, please 
consult a local VA-approved lender such as a bank, S&amp;L or mortgage broker.

CONDO Q &amp; A: DO RESIDENTS HAVE TO PAY FOR TERMITE CONTROL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

QUESTION: We recently discovered that termites are present in our townhouse and 
other townhouses adjoining it. When we contacted the management company, we 
were told that we live in a "planned unit development" (PUD) and the homeowners 
association is not responsible for termite treatment in a PUD. 
</P>
<P>
We bought this townhouse in 1978 thinking that the common areas and structure 
of the buildings were the maintenance responsibility of the association. 
</P>
<P>
If the association is not responsible for the termite control, how do we get 
the cooperation of the adjoining unit owners to allow the treatment and share 
in the cost? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Read your association's legal documents. Even if your association is 
described as a planned development or a PUD, the association documents may 
state that the association is responsible for abatement of wood-destroying 
pests. In a condominium, cooperative or "own-your-own" community apartment 
project, the association is responsible for the termites unless the legal 
documents of the association state otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
If the association's documents state that the association is a PUD but there is 
no mention of the association's responsibility for termite treatment, then it 
is the individual owners who must pay for the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Meet with the other owners in your building to talk about the necessity for 
treatment and the cost. If your building has four or five units, it may be easy 
to reach an agreement on the type of treatment and sharing the cost. 
</P>
<P>
California law states that planned unit developments can take over the 
responsibility for wood-destroying pests by getting the approval of a majority 
of the members of the association. The association is then entitled to recover 
the cost of the treatment and repairs from the individual owners as a special 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
When a Unit Owner Wants to Double Space 
</P>
<P>
Q: A unit owner in our condominium is considering purchasing the adjacent unit 
and expanding to make his unit larger. Our association's legal documents state 
that there are a certain number of units in the condominium. Is changing the 
number of owners subject to the consent of all the owners? 
</P>
<P>
If the two units are combined into one, would the owner have to pay assessments 
for one unit or two? 
</P>
<P>
A: Before the association addresses the issues that you have raised, I 
recommend that the board require the owner to hire an architect and a 
structural engineer to determine whether fire barriers and load-bearing walls 
will be affected. The cost of these consultants should be paid by the owner who 
wants to combine the units. 
</P>
<P>
The percentage of ownership and assessment amount are legal issues that should 
be referred to the association's attorney. I am aware of several condominiums 
where an owner has combined units. In most instances, the owner simply owns two 
units, pays assessments for two units and votes accordingly. Changing the 
percentage of ownership for the whole complex would require a vote of the 
entire membership to amend the association's legal documents. In my opinion, 
this would be unnecessary and unfair to the other owners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Tenants Should Get Copies of the Rules 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our condominium board of directors has not been successful in getting the 
cooperation of a unit owner whose tenant refuses to obey rules and regulations 
of the association. The owner of the unit says that it is not his problem. 
</P>
<P>
When a condominium owner rents the unit to a tenant, who is responsible for 
problems arising from rule violations? Who pays the fines? Can the association 
evict the tenant? 
</P>
<P>
A: How convenient for the owner to say "It's not my problem!" Some owners think 
that as long as they pay their monthly assessment, they have fulfilled their 
obligation to the association. Not true. 
</P>
<P>
Owners who rent their units should provide the tenant with a copy of the 
association rules. In my opinion, the tenant's requirement to comply with the 
rules should be stated in the rental agreement and repeated failure to comply 
with rules should be grounds for eviction. 
</P>
<P>
By virtue of ownership, the unit owner agrees to comply with the association's 
legal documents and rules. However, the association does not have this type of 
agreement with the tenant. Therefore, when the tenant disobeys a rule, the 
association's recourse is against the owner. The association does not have the 
right to evict the tenant unless the association's legal documents and the 
rental agreement have a provision for tenant eviction. 
</P>
<P>
It is wise for the board or management company to send copies of rules to new 
tenants. Then if a violation occurs, the board can assume that the tenant knows 
about the rule. Sometimes a neighborly verbal reminder to the tenant will 
resolve the matter. 
</P>
<P>
If the violation is serious enough to warrant a written notice, the notice 
should be sent to the owner. It is a good idea to send a copy of the notice to 
the tenant, also. Fines should be levied against the unit owner because the 
association is limited in its ability to collect from the tenant.

CO-SIGNING LOAN PUTS CREDIT ON THE LINE;

MAILBAG: A PARENT WANTS TO KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF CO-SIGNING HER DAUGHTER'S 
HOME LOAN. ANOTHER READER ASKS IF NOW IS THE TIME TO REFINANCE. 
</P>

<P>
Recent columns about co-signing loan applications and putting together 
equity-sharing deals have generated lots of questions from readers, while 
others are asking whether it's a good time to refinance their mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
Like so many parents, Barbara Johnson of Orange wants to help her daughter and 
son-in-law buy their first home by co-signing for the loan. 
</P>
<P>
"What are the legal ramifications of this?" she asks. "If they don't make their 
payments, can the lender come after me?" 
</P>
<P>
Yes, folks who co-sign for their kids can be liable if the children don't keep 
up their end of the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
"Co-signing for anybody is a serious step that you can't afford to take 
lightly," said Bob O'Toole, a lending expert with the Mortgage Bankers Assn. of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
If the children defaulted on the loan, O'Toole said, the lender would likely 
foreclose on the property. 
</P>
<P>
But if the home couldn't be sold for an amount high enough to pay the loan in 
full, both the children and their parents could be tapped to make up the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
"Mom and dad's credit rating would get a black-eye, too," O'Toole said. "It's 
OK to co-sign for your kids, but just make sure you know what you're getting 
into." 
</P>
<P>
With prices in so many of the nation's housing markets sky-high, a growing 
number of people are teaming up to buy homes through equity-sharing. 
</P>
<P>
In a typical equity-sharing deal, one person -- the "owner/investor" -- puts up 
most or all of the down payment. The other person, known as the 
"owner/occupant," makes some or all of the monthly mortgage payments. 
</P>
<P>
Profits and mortgage-interest deductions are split according to their wishes. 
The investor might also be able to take depreciation deductions on his half of 
the house because a portion of it could be considered rental property. 
</P>
<P>
John Phillips, who reads this column in the Indianapolis Star, is pondering an 
equity-sharing venture with his brother. He asks: "What are the tax rules that 
guide this type of transaction?" 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most important tax rules concerning equity-sharing agreements are 
contained in provision 280A of the Internal Revenue Service code. 
</P>
<P>
For either party to qualify for deductions, 280A mandates that the 
equity-sharing agreement must be in writing and that at least one of the 
parties must use the home as his primary residence. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS also says that each party must have an ownership interest in the home 
that will last for 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
You don't actually have to keep the property for half a century: It's just that 
the term of the contract must be for at least 50 years in order for both 
parties to take all their deductions. 
</P>
<P>
The trickiest part of 280A is that the person who lives in the home must pay 
the owner/investor "fair-market rent" for the portion of the house that the 
owner/investor owns. If you don't meet this test, some of your deductions can 
be disallowed. 
</P>
<P>
Since equity-sharing involves important tax and legal issues, it's a good idea 
to get the help of both a tax expert and a real estate attorney before you 
enter such an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gonzalez of Los Angeles says he's got a $155,000 adjustable-rate mortgage 
that currently has an 11% rate. "My bank is offering me a 10% fixed-rate loan," 
he writes. "Would it be a good idea to refinance now?" 
</P>
<P>
From a financial point-of-view, it probably doesn't make sense to refinance 
now. 
</P>
<P>
As a general rule, it usually only pays to refinance if the rate on the new 
loan is at least two percentage points below the rate that you're currently 
paying. 
</P>
<P>
That's largely because refinancing often entails thousands of dollars in 
up-front fees -- for points, an appraisal, processing charges and the like. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, if you plan on living in 
the home for several more years, the money you'd save each month by refinancing 
at the lower rate could offset the cost of setting the new mortgage up. 
</P>
<P>
Or, if you have a "convertible" adjustable-rate mortgage that will let you 
switch to a fixed-rate loan for just a few hundred dollars, now might be a good 
time to do it. 
</P>
<P>
You might also want to refinance if you're simply tired of having your payments 
change every time the ARM is adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
"I think rates are going to drop another quarter-point to half a point between 
now and the start of next year," said Fred Flick, an economist with the 
National Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
"But waiting for those lower rates doesn't make sense if you can't sleep at 
night knowing that your current payment is subject to change." 
</P>
<P>
For a more detailed explanation of how to figure if it's time to refinance, see 
Page K2. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Moreno of San Diego is a veteran looking for a mortgage, but he doesn't 
like the 10% rate his banker wants to charge for a Veteran's Administration 
loan. Instead, he's seeking one of the 8% fixed-rate loans offered by the 
California Department of Veterans Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"However, I need a loan of $165,000, but the maximum Cal Vet loan is $125,000," 
he writes. "Can you think of anything that I can do?" 
</P>
<P>
Assuming that you don't have enough cash to make up the $40,000 difference 
between the loan you need and the Cal Vet loan you can get, your best bet is 
probably to take out the $125,000 loan from Cal Vet and get a conventional 
second mortgage for the rest of the needed financing. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you got a 30-year Cal-Vet loan for $125,000 at the current rate 
of 8%, your monthly payment for principal and interest would be about $917. 
</P>
<P>
If you got the remaining $40,000 in financing with the help of a second 
mortgage at the going rate of about 11 1/4%, your monthly payments on the 
second would be $461. So, your total payment on both the first and the second 
mortgages each month would be $1,378. 
</P>
<P>
If you instead opted to take out a VA loan for $165,000 at the current rate of 
10%, your monthly payment for principal and interest would be $1,448. That's 
$50 a month more than you'd pay through a combination of a Cal-Vet first 
mortgage and a conventional second. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, you'd save hundreds or even thousands of dollars in up-front fees 
because the cost of setting up the Cal Vet loan and the second mortgage may be 
well below the costs involved in taking out the VA loan.

QUESTION: My wife and I are both 23 years young. A year and a half ago we 
purchased a town house with a 30-year mortgage. We are thinking of moving in 
approximately three years. Would you consider it wise to accelerate payments in 
this case? In the event of a sale would my wife and I accrue profits reflecting 
these additional "principal only" payments? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: I don't have the sort of crystal ball that can tell me whether you are 
going to have any profit in the sale of this town house or not. After all, 
we're looking about three years into the future when, presumably, "Rambo IX" 
will be ready for release. But we can work out a "what if?" scenario that might 
help. 
</P>
<P>
Let's say that you have a 30-year, $50,000 mortgage on your town house at 10% 
that calls for monthly payments of $438.79 (principal and interest only). Down 
the street, your neighbors, the Hatfields, have exactly the same mortgage. The 
difference is that, with the first payment, you started adding $100 extra to 
your monthly payment to principal. Not so with the Hatfields. 
</P>
<P>
After five years (you've been there a year and a half and are planning to spend 
another three, so that's close enough) you sell -- as do the Hatfields. How 
much "profit" either of you end up with is determined by subtracting from the 
sales price your selling expenses and how much you still owe your lender, 
right? Let's say that both your town house and the Hatfields' have appreciated 
to $60,000 and sell for that. Ignoring the selling costs, the Hatfields will 
walk away with $11,714 because they still owe their lender $48,286 of the 
original $50,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
And you? You'll walk away with $19,457 because you only owe your lender 
$40,543. That's makes you $7,743 better off than the Hatfields in just five 
years -- during which time you will also have paid your lender $1,744 less in 
interest than the Hatfields have. 
</P>
<P>
It's a hard way to build up a nest egg -- paying out a cool $438.79 a month on 
your mortgage and seeing a fat $23 of it building up your equity in the home. 
That's the average reduction of principal in the first year of a 30-year, 10% 
mortgage on a $50,000 home. By painlessly accelerating principal payments you 
can save thousands in mortgage interest, build up equity quickly and lop years 
off your payoff time. Our leaflet, "Free and Clear: Getting the Mortgage Monkey 
Off Your Back," explains how. Send a long, stamped, self-addressed envelope and 
$2 to cover costs to Don Campbell, P.O. Box 80260, Phoenix, Ariz. 85060

<TEXT>
<P>
Cecil Fielder is walking through yet another bizarre afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The sports announcer for Japanese-based Fuji Television is trying his best not 
to crack while interviewing Fielder. Displaying patience in the face of 
technical adversity, the announcer presses on, mumbling a question in Japanese 
that is passed on by a translator to Fielder, who leans forward in a chair. 
</P>
<P>
A choral group is rehearsing the national anthem, and amplified voices in 
perfect harmony bounce off the seats at the Oakland Coliseum. It is like a 
sound check for the Rolling Stones' Steel Wheels Tour. 
</P>
<P>
The technicians are going berserk. The announcer is growing furious. But 
Fielder is smiling, gulping for air, trying to suppress laughter while 
completing the interview. 
</P>
<P>
And why shouldn't he be laughing? 
</P>
<P>
Fielder, born in the U.S.A., rejected in Canada and rejuvenated in Japan, is in 
the most charmed summer of his baseball life. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder has emerged as perhaps the most compelling and unbelievable figure of 
this baseball season, materializing like some samurai Roy Hobbs after a year's 
stay in Japan and finding his way back to a new home with the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Before Saturday night's game at the the Kansas City Royals, Fielder was the 
American League leader in home runs (25), was second in RBI (63) and was 
batting .295 (79 for 268). He also was third among American League first 
basemen in fan balloting for the All-Star Game, July 10 at Chicago's Wrigley 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
Despite not hitting a home run since June 17, Fielder is threatening to become 
the sixth American Leaguer to hit more than 50 in a season, joining the 
exclusive group of Roger Maris, Babe Ruth, Jimmie Foxx, Hank Greenberg and 
Mickey Mantle. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit batting coach Vada Pinson calls Fielder "an angel in disguise." 
All-Star shortstop Alan Trammell says Fielder has carried the Tigers "like no 
player I've ever seen." And Manager Sparky Anderson says, "No one could have 
predicted what Cecil has done." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Fielder remains a mystery, a man drafted by the Baltimore Orioles, signed 
by the Royals, developed by the Toronto Blue Jays and given a second baseball 
life in Japan with the Hanshin Tigers. Fielder is a power hitter who learned 
patience and a labeled failure who discovered success. In short, he embodies 
the baseball belief that what separates the ordinary from the extraordinary is 
sometimes nothing more, or less, than opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"I just needed a chance," Fielder said. "My career was almost over before it 
began." 
</P>
<P>
The raw numbers say Fielder is 26, stands 6-foot-3 and weighs 230 pounds. He is 
big. George Foreman big. If polyester could talk, it would shriek each time 
Fielder slips his uniform on. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder also is playful and soft-spoken. Invariably, he can be found in the 
Tigers' clubhouse wrestling a teammate to the floor and laughing with delight. 
</P>
<P>
So how on earth did someone so large, with a joyous personality to match, slip 
through baseball's cracks and fall all the way to Japan? And then come back 
again? 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy," said Oakland Athletics General Manager Sandy Alderson. "Things 
like that happen all the time. That's how the Baltimore Orioles come up with a 
Mickey Tettleton or the Oakland Athletics pick up a Dave Stewart. This game is 
full of surprises." 
</P>
<P>
But this goes beyond surprise. Twice this season, Fielder has hit three home 
runs in a game. He is as powerful pulling the ball to left field with a wicked 
wave of his 35-inch bat as he is driving the ball the opposite way. 
</P>
<P>
"With Cecil, you throw the ball, and then you pray," said Oakland's Stewart. 
"The man hits everything." 
</P>
<P>
Even Oakland's Jose Canseco, baseball's first $5 million a year player and one 
of the game's most feared home-run hitters, is a Fielder fan. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the power hitters who barely hit home runs," Canseco said. "Spare 
me the grief. But Cecil, he not only hits it, but he hits it a long way." 
</P>
<P>
The moral to the story: Never give up on a big man with pride. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder was a three-sport star at Nogales High School in La Puente, a 
melting-pot community near Los Angeles. Basketball was his first love. He was a 
starting point guard as a 14-year-old freshman and led the team to a state 
playoff semifinal during his senior season in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
In football, Fielder played linebacker and was used as a quarterback on long 
passing downs. Baseball was just something Fielder played to occupy time during 
the spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
John Romano, the Nogales' baseball coach, recalls Fielder's hitting 
tape-measure home runs that sent balls bouncing onto golf courses, skipping 
down streets and soaring over houses. 
</P>
<P>
"He really wanted to play basketball in college," Romano said. "But basketball 
coaches didn't like his body. He was 6 feet 2 and 218 pounds. It was his 
father, Edson, who convinced him to play baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Hailed as a possible heir to Willie Upshaw at first base or Cliff Johnson at 
designated hitter, Fielder failed to meet the expectations of the Blue Jays. In 
parts of four fitful seasons, Fielder hit 31 home runs and drove in 84 runs in 
506 at-bats, but he became lost in the shuffle as the Blue Jays developed Fred 
McGriff. 
</P>
<P>
"The Blue Jays didn't have any room for me," Fielder said. "I was the odd man 
out. I never complained. I never said I wanted to get out of here. I'm glad 
they gave me the opportunity to go elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
What the Blue Jays gave Fielder was a chance to play for Hanshin in Japan for 
$1 million, plus perks that included a furnished apartment for his family, a 
satellite-television dish to pick up American baseball games and a personal 
translator. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder terrorized Japanese Central League pitchers in 1989, hitting .302 with 
38 home runs. His first homer was a 500-foot shot that slammed into a King Kong 
poster at the Tokyo Dome. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit the monkey in the leg," he said. "I thought they were going to give me a 
watch. Some of my teammates even thought I might get a car. But I didn't get 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Fielder received only polite encouragement from his teammates, who consider 
foreign domination foul play. Although he was prepared to remain in Japan for 
another season, Fielder feared for his security when another American, Larry 
Parrish, was released after leading the Yakult Swallows in home runs. Fielder 
exercised an option, received his release and auctioned his services to the 
highest American bidder. 
</P>
<P>
There was no war. The Tigers were the only team to show an interest in Fielder, 
signing him for $3 million for two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't look at it as a gamble," Detroit general manager Bill Lajoie said. "I 
knew he could hit and hit with power. He had better statistics than any 
Triple-A minor-league player in this country." 
</P>
<P>
For a time, Fielder put up numbers that, if generated throughout the season, 
would have given him a 68-homer pace. Inevitably, he cooled off. But, with a 
power hitter, another streak may be around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
"When Cecil goes 0-for-4, people think he's slipping," Tigers outfielder Lloyd 
Moseby said. "But he'll be OK. This man is going to be the Most Valuable Player 
of the American League." 
</P>
<P>
Fielder will hear none of that. Comparisons to Maris and Ruth are useless. MVP 
talk is silly. 
</P>
<P>
"All I wanted was a chance," he said.

STARTING OVER: GIANTS' JOE MORRIS HAS A LOT TO PROVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
You might say Joe Morris is a rookie again -- a rookie in spirit and 
anticipation. He is the possessor of a burning desire to prove to everyone that 
he still belongs among the National Football League's elite running backs. 
</P>
<P>
In less than a month, the New York Giants will open training camp at Farleigh 
Dickinson-Madison, and Morris, who missed all of last season with a broken 
right foot, faces the unfamiliar task of having to fight for a roster spot. 
</P>
<P>
"There is not a lot I can do about what's gone on in the past," Morris said 
recently. "Right now, I live for each day. When I train I live for that. I look 
forward to every day of training camp. Every day will be a new challenge. I'm 
ready for those challenges." 
</P>
<P>
Just four years since leading the Giants to the Super Bowl XXI championship, 
Morris' career is in a precarious state. Here are some reasons why the club's 
all-time leading rusher (5,296 career yards) may not be on the Giants' opening 
day roster: 
</P>
<P>
 -- His health. The Giants want to see how soundly the foot has mended, though 
Morris has been running full speed since November. Experience has made the club 
cautious. George Adams missed the 1986 season with a chipped pelvis and never 
was productive again. Karl Nelson missed the 1987 season with Hodgkins disease 
and was never the right tackle he was in 1986. Morris says he is fine, but the 
Giants will not be convinced until they see him in full gear. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The competition. Rodney Hampton, the third-most productive runner ever at 
Georgia, was the Giants' first selection in April's NFL draft. He is one of 
nine running backs on the roster. Only five or six figure to make the team. 
Morris will likely have to unseat Ottis Anderson (1,023 yards in 1989), a 
favorite of Coach Bill Parcells, or versatile Lee Rouson for a spot. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Cold War. This may be the biggest obstacle Morris must overcome. During 
his previous eight seasons with the Giants, Morris has had a love-hate 
relationship with Parcells and the club's brass. In 1986, he held out of 
training camp in a sometimes bitter contract dispute that did not end until he 
signed the day of the season opener at Dallas. In 1987, he was one of the more 
vocal supporters of the players' strike and was angry when the players returned 
to work without a contract. 
</P>
<P>
Morris and Parcells are hardly speaking after the events of the past year. 
First, Morris was placed on injured reserve for the season after failing to 
convince Parcells he would heal from the broken foot in six to eight weeks. In 
February, Morris was left unprotected during Plan B, an indication the Giants 
did not have him in their plans for 1990. More recently, Morris grudgingly 
agreed to a one-year contract for about $500,000, the same salary he made in 
1989. There was no raise even though he is the club's all-time rushing leader 
and gained at least 1,000 yards in three of the last four years he is played. 
</P>
<P>
There is also the matter of those rumors. Morris was not actively pursued 
during Plan B in part because most teams thought he wanted $1 million and 
because, according to Morris, the Giants spread rumors about him being a 
"psychotic" and "paranoid." The Giants have denied making such remarks. 
</P>
<P>
Morris, who turns 30 in September, would like to believe his clashes with the 
Giants will not have any bearing on whether the club decides to release him, 
trade him or start him this fall. "I'm not a yes man. I have my own opinions 
and own thoughts," he said. "But I've never been disruptive. I've always been 
supportive. Basically, I'm a good person. But when it affects me from a 
business standpoint, I'm going to do what's smart for Joe Morris. And I'll 
always say what I believe to be the truth. I think people have to respect you. 
I respect them (Giants brass) and I think they should respect me for my views 
and my thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
Respect and loyalty, according to former Giants linebacker Harry Carson, are 
two words that have little meaning in the business world of the NFL. In fact, 
he says Morris' past run-ins with the club have made a comeback this year 
improbable. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it did not go over very well with him holding out of camp (in 1986). 
Then during the players' strike, Joe Morris was very militant," Carson said. 
"If you make the team look bad, and sometimes that's what contract situations 
do, the team has a very long memory." 
</P>
<P>
"Quite frankly, I'm surprised that he is still there. My own personal opinion 
is that Joe Morris probably will not be a Giant this year. He'll probably be in 
some other uniform. I think they (Giants) signed him and I think they're going 
to try to get something for him, probably a draft pick or something. I hope I'm 
wrong. I hope he can finish out his career with the team he started with, but 
when you look at things that have happened with the veteran ballplayers on that 
team, you cannot help but think that Joe's next in line." 
</P>
<P>
Carson holds some bitterness over the way his stellar career ended with Giants. 
After announcing earlier in the year that the 1988 season would be his last, 
Carson was put on injured reserve for four of the final five games, just when 
the Giants were in the thick of a playoff chase. Carson had undergone 
arthroscopic knee surgery but vowed he would miss one game at most. Instead, 
Parcells put him on IR and acquired Robb White from the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
There is also the case of Jim Burt, the fiery nose tackle who spearheaded the 
Super Bowl team's defensive line. The Giants forced Burt to retire in July 
after he had turned down a Plan B offer from the Green Bay Packers to stay in 
the Meadowlands. He later hooked up with the San Francisco 49ers and won 
another Super Bowl ring. Kenny Hill, the strong safety on the Giants' Super 
Bowl team, was released early in training camp last year while he was still an 
unsigned free agent. 
</P>
<P>
Said Carson: "People look at pro football as being glamorous. But pro football 
is a business. The players know that. That's why you have very little loyalty. 
When the oldtimers say, 'what happened to the loyalty?' that's where the 
loyalty has gone. That's why players go out and get as much (money) as they can 
get. When you have injured players who played when they should not have played, 
but did so for the sake of their team, and then the team turns around and does 
that to you, there is no loyalty there. Players learn from the experience of 
other players. Jim Burt once told me, 'I should have learned from what happened 
to you.' I think Joe Morris might feel the same way." 
</P>
<P>
General Manager George Young understands how some players can get bitter when 
the end is near. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it is tough to walk away from the money and most of them think they can 
still play," Young said. "If they do not want to make a decision, I do not mind 
making it for them. But they should accept it." 
</P>
<P>
With training camp approaching, Morris' spirits are upbeat. He certainly feels 
better than he did in August when his foot was broken on his second carry in 
the preseason finale against the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
In previous years, Morris would have been placed on injured reserve and been 
eligible to return in six weeks. But in a rule change passed before the 1989 
season, players on IR and not included on the 47-man roster are ineligible for 
the regular and postseason. 
</P>
<P>
Parcells could have included Morris on the 47-man roster then placed him on 
injured reserve and activated someone healthy. That way Morris could have been 
activated in a minimum of six weeks. But the early prognosis from the Giants' 
medical staff was that Morris would be out for two to three months and Parcells 
was reluctant to cut another player in hopes Morris would be ready by November. 
</P>
<P>
The coach broke the news to Morris during a private meeting the day after the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not happy about it and let him know that," Morris said. "I worked too 
hard during the offseason to let it all go that easily. I wanted to compete." 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, Morris backed the Giants' decision. "I feel I could be ready in six 
to eight weeks. But I support their decision," he told reporters in September. 
Privately, the running back felt betrayed. 
</P>
<P>
As the Giants went on to a 12-4 season and a National Football Conference East 
championship, Morris withdrew from the team. He attended only three team 
functions during the year, one a union meeting that Morris -- one of the 
Giants' co-player representatives -- presided over. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt out of place there," he said. "I know how I was about distractions 
when I was getting ready for a game. I thought I'd be a distraction if I came 
around. Plus, when I was on my crutches I did not want anybody to see me and 
feel sorry for me." 
</P>
<P>
The cast was removed after seven weeks and by late November Morris was playing 
basketball twice a week. While he contends that proves he could have played the 
final third of the season, the Giants are not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
"With all the things that a running back has to do, it is hard to say if he 
could have played," Giants trainer Ronnie Barnes said. "We'll never know for 
sure. But we doubt it. Eric Dorsey broke his foot (in the second game of the 
regular season) and was still favoring it in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
Said Morris: "I thank the Giants for being concerned about my foot and not 
wanting to rush me back. But I would have liked for them to have given me a 
shot last year." 
</P>
<P>
Whether he earns a shot this year will largely depend on his performance in 
training camp. One theory is that the Giants will work him hard through the 
first two preseason games then test his trade value. If he looks too good, the 
Giants could keep him. 
</P>
<P>
"If I'm going to leave, I'd like to leave under good circumstances where I can 
say I've given it everything I've got and things just did not work out," he 
said. "I still feel I can play. I can help a team do some things. You've got to 
feel that way about yourself and you cannot let anybody deter you from that."

MARTINEZ DOING WHAT GOODEN DID IN 1984

<P>
The Los Angeles Dodgers began the year with two Cy Young Award winners and a 
returning 15-game winner who led the major leagues with eight shutouts last 
season. But neither Orel Hershiser, who is out for the season because of 
rotator cuff surgery, nor Fernando Valenzuela, who has been ordinary, nor Tim 
Belcher, who is hurting, has emerged as the ace of the staff. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, that title has been seized by a skinny, 22-year-old Dominican with a 
soft voice and a childlike smile. The Dodgers and the rest of the National 
League are discovering that, appearances aside, Ramon Martinez is one mean 
pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"He always has this smile on his face and when he's out there on the mound he's 
just like a kid having fun," Dodgers pitching coach Ron Perranoski said. "I 
told him, 'Ramon, don't you ever change.' He's a real nice kid." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez has made a practice of throwing the game ball into the stands whenever 
he pitches a complete-game win. But when he beat Atlanta, 5-2, Monday night, he 
handed the ball to a boy near the Dodgers' dugout. 
</P>
<P>
"He was cute. Why not?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
The victory improved Martinez' record to 9-3. He struck out nine batters 
without walking one. He leads the major leagues with 121 strikeouts and is on a 
pace to finish with 282. In Dodgers history, only Sandy Koufax has struck out 
more than 262 batters in a season. And Martinez already tied Koufax' club 
record for strikeouts in a game when he whiffed 18 Braves on June 4. His 
fastball was regularly clocked at 96 mph in that game. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez' velocity is unusual considering he is 6-4 and 175 pounds -- not much 
thicker than when the Dodgers signed him when he was 16. "I don't know where he 
gets it from," Perranoski said. Martinez throws two fastballs: a sinking 
fastball and another that breaks away from right-handers with the action of a 
slider. He is just beginning to develop a good feel for a curveball. 
</P>
<P>
"Once he gets the consistency with his curveball, then he'll really be 
something," Perranoski said. "He's so deceptive because he's long and gangly. 
When he starts to warm up, I don't even want to look at him ... he throws from 
around the hip and throws the ball eight feet high. But he gets it together in 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Not since Dwight Gooden in 1984 has such a pitching prospect arrived at such a 
young age and with such good stuff. And, like Gooden, Martinez has been 
immediately comfortable with the responsibilities of being an ace. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he doesn't even know who Hershiser is," Perranoski said. "There's just 
this aura about him. Deep down, I'm sure he knows who Orel is. But he doesn't 
show any signs of any of this bothering him." 
</P>
<P>
One warning here: the Dodgers ought to be very careful about letting Martinez 
throw so many innings at such a young age. (He threw 399 pitches in his past 
three starts over 10 days, he leads the league with five complete games, and he 
is pitching in a four-man rotation.) They have seen Valenzuela and Hershiser 
blow out their shoulders and now Belcher's shoulder is ailing. 
</P>
<P>
"(Belcher) just doesn't feel right," Perranoski said. "He just doesn't have his 
consistent zip. So far, we haven't been able to pinpoint it." 
</P>
<P>
Belcher said he hasn't felt right all year and thinks it goes back to the 
lockout. Remember, Belcher threw a complete-game, three-hitter his first time 
out after the short spring. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, the owners can take the lockout and shove it," he told Los Angeles 
writers. "It was the worst mistake the owners have ever made in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
Padres looking ahead: The disappointing Padres dropped a hint about their 
chances of catching the Reds Monday when Manager Jack McKeon told shortstop 
Garry Templeton on Monday that he was being replaced by Roberto Alomar, who had 
been playing second base. Bip Roberts will play second base. 
</P>
<P>
Templeton was hitting .264 with 28 runs batted in, but he is 34 and has 
troublesome knees that limit his range. McKeon, who said he hoped the changes 
would be "forever," thought it was time to look beyond this one-sided pennant 
race. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to look down the line," he said. "It's not like we're a half-game up 
or a half-game down. We're 10 games out. We have to face reality." 
</P>
<P>
In his first game as the second baseman of the future, Roberts botched a sure 
double-play ball that helped put San Diego down, 4-0, in a game won by Houston, 
5-3. 
</P>
<P>
Musical chairs: George Steinbrenner fires managers so often that it has become 
a trivial event. So consider these managerial minutiae: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Steinbrenner has changed managers 18 times in 18 seasons of owning the 
Yankees. The Dodgers franchise has changed managers 15 times since 1899. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bucky Dent became the first manager Steinbrenner fired on a Wednesday. The 
scorecard: Sunday 6, Monday 4, Tuesday 2, Wednesday 1, Thursday 1 and Friday 4. 
Saturday has been his day of rest. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dent's 89-game tenure dropped the average length of service of a 
Steinbrenner manager to 144 games. Since the Yankees last won anything, in 
1981, it is 122 games. 
</P>
<P>
One Yankee came up with an interesting theory about Steinbrenner's latest 
change in managers and his subsequent commitment to young players: "He knows 
what he's doing. Look what he's done to this team. He's made sure it can't win 
in case he's suspended (by Commissioner Fay Vincent). That way, when he comes 
back, he can say that the team needs him running things." 
</P>
<P>
Around the league: Yes, Mark Langston is 4-8 and, as expected, has not been 
worth the Angels' $16-million investment. But in his eight losses California 
has scored a total of five runs while he's been on the mound. In Langston's 
past four starts, the Angels have lost 2-1, 2-1, 2-1 and 2-0. Langston took the 
loss in three of those games. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Tibbs, though only 28, is pitching with his sixth organization. He is not 
the answer to Pittsburgh's pitching problems. The Pirates should make a run for 
Tim Leary. 
</P>
<P>
Why is it that the Cardinals can just disappear every other year and nobody 
questions Whitey Herzog? Since 1985, St. Louis is 282-204 (.580) in 
odd-numbered years and 184-209 (.468) in even-numbered years. 
</P>
<P>
Gooden is 106-44 and has pitched 1,390 innings in 192 career games. Roger 
Clemens is 106-48 and has pitched 1,399 2-3 innings in 191 career games.

GLENDALE GAINS FROM ERRORS BY PANORAMA CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VITTORIO TAFUR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each time American Legion District 20 opponents Glendale and Panorama City 
meet, it turns out to be an exercise in baseball eccentricity. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks ago, Panorama City used three Glendale errors to win, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday at Monroe High, it was Panorama City's turn to prove that misses 
are at least as important as hits in determining the final score. 
</P>
<P>
Despite belting 12 hits, four for extra bases, Panorama City also dished out 
four errors. The final miscue, a three-base error by center fielder Robert 
Kite, was more than enough to allow Glendale to win, 6-4, and tie the season 
series. Glendale improved to 10-5 and Eastern Division opponent Panorama City 
dropped to 11-5. 
</P>
<P>
"They hit us, we win the game," Panorama City Coach Scott Smith said 
matter-of-factly. "We hit them, they win the game. Errors have been the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Despite a solo home run by Panorama City's Russell Ortiz in the fifth inning 
and two triples by pitcher Sean Henson, Glendale entered the seventh with a 3-2 
lead. Shane Cowsill opened with a walk and promptly stole second. After 
advancing to third on a ground out, Cowsill tried to score on Brent Overfelt's 
suicide squeeze. Panorama City first baseman Roland De La Maza pounced on the 
ball and fired home, getting Cowsill and ending the rally. Or so it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
Overfelt stole second and scored on Dan Evans' base hit for the first run in 
the two-out rally. John Aquilar then followed with a line single to center that 
should not have scored Evans, let alone Aquilar. Both scored, however, when 
Kite swiped futilely at the ball, which rolled to the center-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
Those runs turned out to be the difference in the game after Panorama City 
scored twice in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
Overfelt relieved starter and winner Daniel Gray in the eighth, retiring four 
of the last five Panorama City batters to earn the save. 
</P>
<P>
Henson, who was relieved by Ortiz in the sixth, allowed only four hits and 
three runs, including one earned run. 
</P>
<P>
"Our pitchers did a really good job -- they are in no way responsible for 
today's loss," Smith said. "There are a lot of good teams in the Eastern 
Division. A couple of errors to anyone will mean a loss."

AUSTIN'S NEW CITY LIMITS; 
</P>
<P>
FORMER SOUTH TORRANCE FOOTBALL COACH TAKES JOB AT RIVAL NORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Say it ain't so, Joe. 
</P>
<P>
 That undoubtedly was the reaction of South Torrance High football fans when 
Joe Austin, coach of the Spartans for 17 years, was named coach of rival North 
Torrance High two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Austin's son, Brett, a former football standout for South, was one of those 
initially disturbed by the news. 
</P>
<P>
"My son and his friends see it as a loyalty thing," Kathie Austin said. "At 
first, it was, 'Oh no, how can you do this to the Spartans?' 
</P>
<P>
"It's a funny feeling. Who would have ever thought he'd coach at North?" 
</P>
<P>
Not Joe Austin, that's for sure. 
</P>
<P>
"I really couldn't picture myself coaching here at first," he said. "I said, 
'God, what am I doing here?' " 
</P>
<P>
Austin didn't end up at North by design. 
</P>
<P>
When he left teaching in January of 1989 to go into private business with his 
brother, Jeff, Austin was excited about embarking on a new career. "The 
possibility to make a lot of money was there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But 14 months later, Austin, 47, was faced with a mid-life crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine-based computer company he worked for was strapped financially, and 
the owner informed all the sales representatives, including Austin, that they 
would no longer receive a salary. They would only be paid on commission. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the worst day of my life," Austin said. "My brother had to tell me, 
too. It was the worst day of his life." 
</P>
<P>
Unable to support his family under those terms, Austin left the company. 
</P>
<P>
That was in March. Today, he is teaching science and coaching football at 
North. And he couldn't be happier. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where I belong, by far," he said. "I wasn't dealing with what I really 
like to do at the computer company. Because, a lot of times, adults are not a 
whole lot of fun to work with, and the kids are great." 
</P>
<P>
Austin has always enjoyed working with kids, whether they are at South or 
North. He realizes that more than ever after his ill-fated experience in the 
business world. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know how much I missed coaching until I got back in coaching," he 
said. "A lot of times when you leave, all you remember is the bad stuff. Then 
when you get back, you remember the good stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"The reward at the computer company was money. The reward in education is 
seeing the kids get better and learn." 
</P>
<P>
Austin recovered quickly after he left the computer company late in March. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, he was on the phone with John Conway, director of personnel for 
the Torrance Unified School District. He learned there was an opening in the 
science department at North and set up an interview with Principal Peggy 
Tremayne. 
</P>
<P>
Once hired, Austin looked into rejoining the coaching ranks. 
</P>
<P>
Regaining his old job at South was out of the question because Don Morrow had 
established himself during his rookie season last year, guiding the team to a 
second-place finish in the Ocean League and a CIF playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
Austin thought about returning to South as an assistant coach and possibly 
coaching the Spartan baseball team, but what he really wanted was another head 
coaching job in football. 
</P>
<P>
The opportunity arose in May, when Don Bohannon resigned after four years as 
North's coach. According to a source, Bohannon was pressured to resign by 
Tremayne, the principal, after he purchased new uniforms without permission. 
</P>
<P>
"If he wouldn't have resigned, (Tremayne) would have fired him," said the 
source, who requested anonymity. "He made one mistake and she jumped all over 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bohannon: "Let's just say there were disagreements. I promised her I 
wouldn't get into it." 
</P>
<P>
Tremayne said she would not have fired Bohannon. She declined to comment on the 
allegation that Bohannon violated school policy by purchasing new uniforms 
without getting the money up front. 
</P>
<P>
Austin, worried that Bohannon might suspect he had something to do with the 
coach's removal, tried to smooth over any hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as he resigned, I went over to his classroom and said, 'Hey, I don't 
know if it's a coincidence or what, but I haven't talked to (Tremayne) about 
the head job and I hope you don't think it's me that made you have to resign.' 
It really made me feel bad." 
</P>
<P>
Athletic Director Steve Schmitz, who coached North for 10 seasons before 
becoming an assistant at El Camino College in 1986, took over the Saxons in 
spring football and persuaded Austin to help out. A few weeks later, Austin was 
chosen over four other finalists to become North's coach. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fate," Austin said. "I remember when I walked on the field with Steve 
Schmitz. I said, 'Steve, I would have bet you a million dollars that I'd never 
walk on this field as the coach.' " 
</P>
<P>
When Austin was at South and Schmitz was coaching at North, they met 10 times 
on the gridiron. Now they are working together, trying to help North return to 
prominence after a 2-8 season in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Austin is coaching the offense and Schmitz has taken the defense in the Saxons' 
passing-league games. But Austin said he doesn't know if Schmitz's commitments 
to El Camino will allow him to coach at North in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"If Steve could stay, that would really be great," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly two decades, Austin's name was synonymous with South Torrance 
football. 
</P>
<P>
His teams compiled a record of 108-63-2 and won league titles in 1981, '86 and 
'87. Among the players who blossomed under Austin were linemen Brian Kelly and 
Wes Jordan (both UCLA recruits), wide receivers Johnnie Morton (USC), Rich 
Harger and Derek Sholl, linebacker Paul Hill (Oregon State), running back Steve 
Kujawa and two members of his own family -- brother Jeff, a quarterback who 
played at El Camino and Colorado, and his son Brett, a tight end who played at 
El Camino before giving up football after a neck injury. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Austin was a standout athlete himself at South, excelling in football, 
basketball and baseball. He went on to play baseball at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have a lot of loyalties at South," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He grew up in the South Torrance area and now resides in nearby Redondo Beach. 
If ever there was a man who appeared entrenched in his job, it was Austin. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, did he give up a secure teaching position for a sales job he knew 
virtually nothing about? 
</P>
<P>
"It was the excitement, the money," he said. "It sounded so neat. The company 
was growing so much. We had a chance to really make it big. It just didn't work 
out." 
</P>
<P>
As a sales rep, Austin's job was to find buyers for the company's line of 
computer systems. He left home at 7 a.m. and usually didn't return until 7 p.m. 
Most of his day was spent on the freeway or on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
When the business was flourishing, he had no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think about football," he said. "I didn't even think about education. 
All I thought about was selling computers and learning how to be a good 
salesman. That's how you've got to be, because if you're not, you won't be able 
to do it." 
</P>
<P>
In time, though, Austin began to grow weary of the long drive to Orange County. 
And, he began to miss the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we realized how much he missed teaching and coaching," Kathie 
Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Austin said he would have stuck with it if the company had not 
encountered a financial crunch. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they said they couldn't pay me, I said, 'Hey, that's it.' But I would 
have stayed with it. I would have given it another year." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Austin returned to the classroom with no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"I would do it all over again," he said. "It was a hell of a good experience. I 
learned a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Austin begins his second coaching stint with renewed enthusiasm and new 
objectives. 
</P>
<P>
"When I left South, I wrote down all the things I wanted to do but never did," 
he said. "I made a promise to myself that if I ever came back, I'd do certain 
things differently." 
</P>
<P>
They include taking more interest in players on the underclass levels and 
spending more time working with the varsity quarterback in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
Austin said North quarterback Brian Jurado doesn't need much work. The senior, 
beginning his third year as the varsity starter, led the South Bay with 1,943 
yards passing in 10 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
"He's as good as any of the quarterbacks I've ever coached," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the L.A. Games last weekend, the Saxons defeated Chatsworth and Verbum Dei 
before losing to Canyon of Santa Clarita. Austin expects the winning ways to 
continue next fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're capable of winning the (Pioneer League) title," he said. "These 
kids are good." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bohannon: "I expect them to do very well next year." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the relative closeness of North and South, which are about five miles 
apart, Austin said there are differences in the programs. He said more students 
come out for football at North because the school has a higher enrollment. And 
he said the North players are generally tougher. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of them come from neighborhoods which are tougher, which is neat, 
especially for football," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That comment probably won't endear Austin to his old friends at South, but it 
is an indication he's beginning to feel at home at North. 
</P>
<P>
His wife has noticed the change. 
</P>
<P>
"He's so excited," Kathie Austin said. "He loves to put in a long day. It's 
nice to get that feeling of starting over again."

ERICKSON PROVIDES LATE SPARK TO IGNITE GLENDALE TO 14-7 ALL-STAR FOOTBALL WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
Aaron Erickson of Crescenta Valley High caught only two passes Saturday night 
in the second Glendale-Burbank All-Star Football Game at La Canada High, but 
they were key receptions. 
</P>
<P>
Erickson, running a post pattern, hauled in a seven-yard touchdown toss from 
Chris Bisgaard of Flintridge Prep late in the third quarter to lift Glendale to 
a 14-7 win. 
</P>
<P>
"I was telling them that I could beat them on the play," said Erickson, who was 
named the Glendale team's most valuable player, "and it ended up working." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the seven-play drive, the Glendale College-bound Erickson pulled 
down a Bisgaard pass to complete a 40-yard play that moved the ball to the 
Burbank nine. Two plays later, Erickson caught what proved to be the deciding 
score. 
</P>
<P>
"(Erickson) showed a lot of determination to make those catches," Bisgaard 
said. "He really did a job and ran some great patterns. There's not much more 
you can ask for." 
</P>
<P>
Bisgaard, playing in his first 11-man game, completed only three of eight 
passes, the other being a 27-yard pass to Flintridge Prep teammate David Swayne 
(two receptions, 47 yards). 
</P>
<P>
"The field is wider and there are more options (in 11-man football)," Bisgaard 
said. "It makes it a lot easier to hit receivers." 
</P>
<P>
Bisgaard and Swayne, who is bound for Duke, helped lead Flintridge Prep to the 
Eight-Man Southern Section Large-Schools title last fall. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Traughber of La Canada led the Glendale ground game, picking up 50 yards 
in 12 carries, including two five-yard runs with less than two minutes to play 
to help preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Montclair Prep's Greg Coile, playing for Burbank, led all rushers with 62 yards 
in 10 carries. He had runs of 29 and 23 yards in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
After a scoreless first quarter, Greg Andrachick of Notre Dame gave Burbank a 
7-0 lead early in the second period with a 1-yard quarterback sneak to 
culminate an 11-play, four-and-a-half minute drive. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Afarian of Notre Dame kicked the extra point. 
</P>
<P>
Di'Allo Frazier of Van Nuys set up Andrachick's run with a seven-yard scamper. 
</P>
<P>
After being stopped at the line of scrimmage, Frazier broke away from the grasp 
of several defenders to make his way to the Glendale two. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Hurley of St. Francis set up the Glendale's first score with a 51-yard 
punt return to the Burbank 16. 
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Santiago Alvarez of Franklin scored on a five-yard run down 
the left sideline with 2 minutes 51 seconds left before intermission. Ross 
Allan of La Canada added the extra point. 
</P>
<P>
The game featured seniors from 26 area high schools. 
</P>
<P>
The inaugural game ended in a 19-19 tie.

RESEDA'S GUNNARSON STORMS TO WIN IN HOBBY STOCK MAIN AT SAUGUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yellow was the color of the night in the 25-lap Hobby Stock main event Saturday 
night at Saugus Speedway as four caution flags slowed matters considerably. 
</P>
<P>
But from his back-of-the-pack starting position, all Jim Gunnarson of Reseda 
wanted to see was the coveted black-and-white flag. 
</P>
<P>
After several skillful passes, Gunnarson, who started 22nd in a field of 27 
cars, bumped and burned his way to the victory in front of 3,882 to celebrate 
his 44th birthday in style. 
</P>
<P>
In the 40-lap Sportsman main event, Larry Krieger of Reseda restored a recent 
Saugus trend by starting on the pole and leading all the way for his second 
main-event win of the season. Keith Spangler of Northridge took second. 
</P>
<P>
"I was worried," the 24-year-old Krieger said of Spangler. "But Keith Spangler 
drives the fairest race I've ever seen from anybody behind me. And if anybody 
would pass me, Keith would do it, but if so, he'd do it fair and square." 
</P>
<P>
There would be no lead changes, though, as Pat Mintey Jr. of Quartz Hill took 
third and Craig Rayburn of Simi Valley, also celebrating a birthday, took 
fourth. John Cran of Reseda took fifth. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of passing was unlike the Hobby Stock race, during which Gunnarson 
weaved his car in and out of traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"It is pretty tough (starting in the back)," Gunnarson said. 
</P>
<P>
"Except that the guys in front seem to make a lot of mistakes. So the first 15 
laps, until the field settles down, you keep an eye on 'em and then try to push 
'em off." 
</P>
<P>
On Lap 20, Gunnarson executed a forceful pass of leader Joe Barreras Sr. of 
Canyon Country and coasted the final five laps for the win. 
</P>
<P>
"I was passing out out there," Gunnarson said of the repeated delays. "But when 
they turn off that caution light, it keys you up again." 
</P>
<P>
Gunnarson wasn't the only fast qualifier to overcome the inverted Hobby Stock 
field. James Kusch of Sepulveda, who started 19th, finished second overall, and 
Bob Vigil of Lancaster, who started 23rd, finished third behind Gunnarson and 
Kusch. 
</P>
<P>
Bad luck continued to befall Gerald Gledhill of Reseda, who won a trophy dash 
earlier in the evening, then sustained heavy damage to his car's front and back 
ends in a Lap 18 crash. 
</P>
<P>
The same scenario occurred the last time the Hobby Stocks ran at Saugus on May 
26, when Gledhill won a trophy dash, then sustained serious damage in the 
figure-eight main event. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time," Gunnarson 
said of Gledhill. 
</P>
<P>
In the Hobby Stock figure-eight main event, Shannon Slavin of West Hills 
pleased a fan club of about 100 by overtaking Oliver Aguilar of Sun Valley on 
Lap 9 for the win. 
</P>
<P>
Starting in the seventh position of an inverted field of 19 cars in the Jalopy 
main event, Andrew Debasio of Van Nuys took the lead on Lap 3 to win the 15-lap 
race.

AMERICAN LEGION ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
ENCINO-CRESPI FALLS SHORT AGAIN, 5-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Encino-Crespi's American Legion baseball team has struggled this season, 
failing to capitalize on its opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Encino-Crespi came up short again Saturday, failing to produce with the game on 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
Western Division-leading Woodland Hills East rallied for three runs in the 
eighth to win, 5-3, in the District 20 game at Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the same old story," Encino-Crespi Coach Scott Muckey said. 
</P>
<P>
After East (14-1) took a 5-2 lead in the top of the eighth, Encino-Crespi 
rallied for a run off reliever Chris Brown in the bottom of the inning. 
Encino-Crespi left the bases loaded, however, which served as a prelude to the 
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
With runners at first and third in the ninth, Vic Seper sent a shot down the 
line at first, but East's John Erganian gloved the ball for the final out. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 2-2, East shortstop Benji Belfield started the 
eighth-inning rally with a one-out triple off reliever Brett Farlow (0-1). 
After a pair of walks loaded the bases, Erganian gave East a 3-2 lead with a 
run-scoring ground out to first. Carey Wilbur then delivered a two-run single 
for a 5-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Casey Snow was two for three and stole two bases for Encino-Crespi (4-10). 
Belfield had two hits for East. 
</P>
<P>
In other District 20 games: 
</P>
<P>
Woodland Hills West 6, Granada Hills 1 -- Catcher Bobby Kim (two for four) 
slammed a two-run homer to spark a three-run first inning for West at El Camino 
Real. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Terry Morrow (3-0) allowed six hits, struck out 10 and walked 
three for West, which won for the eighth time in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
West improved to 12-5, 9-4 in district play. Granada Hills is 4-11. 
</P>
<P>
Sun Valley 3, Verdugo Hills 2 -- Roy Lozano's single in the ninth drove in Sef 
Carlin from third to win it at Poly. 
</P>
<P>
Right-hander Jake Loveridge (3-1) allowed one earned run on three hits, walked 
five and struck out two for Sun Valley (13-1). 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, Carlin beat out a bunt and took third on an errant pickoff. After 
Jonathan Campbell walked, Lozano punched a game-wining looper into right-center 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Lozano, Carlin and Marlon McKinney each had two hits for Sun Valley. Verdugo 
Hills is 6-8. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda 4, Las Virgenes 3 -- Reseda turned three double plays to back the 
six-hit pitching of Louis Vanacore at Reseda High. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 3-3, and two out in the fifth, Ari Jacobs (three hits) 
singled and scored on a double by Jeff Taylor. Jesse Yeomans had two hits for 
Reseda (8-7). Tom Lynch and Tom Hoover each had two hits for Las Virgenes 
(9-6). 
</P>
<P>
Chatsworth 10, Agoura 8 -- Chatsworth catcher Mike Mancuso nailed down the game 
and bailed out his batterymate with three innings of relief at Agoura High. 
</P>
<P>
With Chatsworth ahead, 10-7, Mancuso allowed a lone run in the eighth to earn 
his first save. Starter Danny Rodriguez (2-2) earned the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Mancuso was two for three and drove in two runs for Chatsworth (6-7). Bob 
Kazmirski and pitcher Joey Medaglia (1-2) each had two hits and drove in two 
runs for Agoura (7-9).

VALLEY RANGERS WIN AFTER A SLOW START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Valley Rangers survived three errors and five San Luis Obispo runs in the 
first inning en route to a 9-7 win in a consolation-bracket game of the 
National Baseball Congress state tournament Saturday in Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
After the first inning, right-hander Lance Gibson retired 15 of the next 17 
batters he faced, and Valley crawled back into the game with a run in the 
first, three in the third and another in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
With the score tied, 5-5, in the seventh, Valley shortstop Donnie Erickson 
slammed a three-run home run to make a winner of reliever Tim DeGrasse (1-0). 
</P>
<P>
J. P. Des Enfants and Kris Kaelin each went three for five for Valley (14-4), 
which will play at 1 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
In six innings, Gibson allowed one earned run, struck out five and walked none. 
</P>
<P>
Valley is 1-1 in the double-elimination event that serves as a qualifier for 
the NBC World Series in Wichita, Kan., this month.

VALLEY'S CLARKE FINISHES STRONGLY TO WIN HEPTATHLON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Valley College's Melanie Clarke turned in a torrid second-day performance to 
post a come-from-behind victory in the heptathlon in The Athletics Congress 
junior championships in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke totaled 5,080 points to outdistance Edwina Ammonds (4,958) of Kings 
River College, Kalleen Madden (4,931) of Texas A &amp; M, and pre-meet favorite 
Tish Milligan (4,821) of the Knoxville Track Club. 
</P>
<P>
Third after the first four events Thursday with 3,026 points, Clarke maintained 
that position with a mark of 17 feet 9 1/4 inches in the long jump to start 
Friday's final three events, then took the lead for good with a personal-best 
121-1 in the javelin. 
</P>
<P>
She capped the day with a time of 2 minutes 24.11 seconds in the 800. Clarke's 
marks in the javelin and the 800 were the best in the 14-woman field. 
</P>
<P>
Although Clarke won, she fell short of the qualifying standard (5,300 points) 
for the World Junior Championships in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, Aug. 8-12.

L.A. GAMES ROUNDUP;

<P>
GOALKEEPER THOMPSON LEADS ROYAL INTO SOCCER FINAL AGAINST ORANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Royal High soccer Coach Peter Schraml said he was "a bit nervous" when starting 
goalkeeper Steven Hambly set out for an Olympic development soccer camp at 
Stanford University, leaving the Highlander skipper with incoming freshman 
Brent Thompson to tend the cages. 
</P>
<P>
Any doubts about Thompson's ability vanished when he and Royal posted 
consecutive shutouts in the quarterfinal and semifinal rounds of the L.A. Games 
on Saturday at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson made one save in a 3-0 quarterfinal win over North Torrance and had 
three stops against Bell Gardens to help spark a 2-0 semifinal victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a bit nervous because I hadn't seen Brent play at all," Schraml said. 
"He practiced with us in one practice before the tournament. It seemed to work 
out well." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson also kept alive Royal's perfect defensive record in the 64-team 
tournament. The Highlanders have not allowed a goal in five matches. 
</P>
<P>
In today's final Royal will meet Orange, which defeated Pasadena Muir, 3-2, in 
a semifinal shootout. The championship at El Camino College will be a rematch 
of the 1989 title game, which ended in a 1-1 tie. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a very skillful team," Schraml said of Orange, which won the Southern 
Section 2-A Division title last year. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Dan Morris led Royal's attack Saturday, scoring twice against North 
Torrance and once against Bell Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Troy Burley and forward Ryan Campbell also added goals for Royal. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TRACK AND FIELD 
</P>
<P>
Howard Schrier of Birmingham High cleared 13 feet 8 inches to win the pole 
vault at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
Schrier's mark was just off his personal best of 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Wiley of Monroe and Robin Heidt of Canyon posted comfortable wins in 
their 1,500-meter finals. Wiley timed 4 minutes 23.3 seconds. Heidt ran away 
from Locke's Brenda Stewart.

ADDING EXTRA COOLING UNIT CAN SAVE MONEY 
</P>

QUESTION: Are there any super high-efficiency window air conditioners made? My 
family room does not always stay cool. Does it make sense to use a window unit 
even if I have central air conditioning? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: It makes a lot of sense to use a window air conditioner even though you 
have central air conditioning. It can dramatically lower your summertime 
electric bills and improve your comfort. 
</P>
<P>
There are some new super energy-efficient window air conditioners available 
with Energy Efficiency Ratios (EER) as high as 11. They are quiet and have many 
special convenience features. Many new window air conditioners are 
significantly more efficient than your present central air conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of making a major expenditure for a new, more efficient central air 
conditioner, buying a relatively inexpensive, high-efficiency window or 
through-the-wall air conditioner is sometimes a better investment. I use a 
small window unit in the study where I write my column. 
</P>
<P>
If a typical 3-ton (36,000 BTUs per hour) central air conditioner has an EER of 
eight, it costs about 36 cents (at an electric rate of 8 cents per kilowatt 
hour) per hour it runs. A super high-efficiency 5,000 BTU-per-hour window unit 
costs about 4 cents per hour. 
</P>
<P>
By setting your central air conditioner's thermostat five degrees higher, you 
can cut your electric bills up to 25%, depending on your climate. Then you can 
run a small window unit to keep one or two rooms cooler. Since it runs less, 
your central air conditioner should require fewer service calls. 
</P>
<P>
Super high-efficiency window air conditioners use special coil and fin designs 
to improve heat transfer and efficiency. Some have special controls to 
automatically de-ice. 
</P>
<P>
Some models have an energy-saving option that cycles the blower on and off 
(instead of running continuously.) This is also convenient, especially at 
night. As your bedroom cools off, the blower stops automatically, so you don't 
have to get up to turn it off. 
</P>
<P>
The high-efficiency window units are usually the most quiet too. They are 
designed with well-insulated large blower compartments. The insulation reduces 
heat entry and blocks the sound. Rotary compressors contribute to efficiency 
and quiet operation. 
</P>
<P>
Select a high-efficiency unit with five blower speeds and many adjustable 
outlet louvers. These features improve the cool air distribution throughout the 
room or rooms and improve your comfort. 
</P>
<P>
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 396 listing manufacturers, 
model numbers and EER of the 100 highest-efficiency window air conditioners (12 
in each size range) from 5,000 to 14,000 BTU per hour cooling capacity, and a 
detailed work sheet to determine the proper unit for your home. Please include 
$1 and a self-addressed business envelope. Send your requests to James Dulley,

How to Check for Energy-Saving Glass 
</P>
<P>
Q: I recently had new replacement windows installed and I requested and paid 
extra for energy-saving low-E (low emissivity) glass. How can I tell if it 
really is low-E glass and not standard glass? 
</P>
<P>
A: When you are indoors and looking outdoors in the daytime, low-E glass 
appears perfectly clear. If you stand outdoors and look indoors, low-E glass 
often has a slight bluish appearance. If some sunlight reflects from it on to a 
light-colored sidewalk or car, you can sometimes detect the bluish cast. It 
also looks slightly more reflective when you try to look outdoors at night from 
a lighted room.

LEAKY EXHAUST DUCTS WASTE HOT, COLD AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MORRIS CAREY and JAMES CAREY, The Careys are syndicated columnists and 
general contractors in the San Francisco Bay area. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I read in the paper that air infiltration accounts for 40% to 50% of 
the energy wasted on home heating and cooling. How can I close off the fan 
ducts in the bathroom and still have them operational? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Actually, there is a very good chance that your exhaust fans are 
already infiltration controlled. This is usually accomplished in the fan 
housing with an exhaust-air-pressure controlled "flapper" type damper that 
opens when the fan is operating and closes when the fan is off. Air flow coming 
from the exterior end of the exhaust duct helps the keep the damper closed. 
</P>
<P>
To find out if a damper exists, remove the exhaust fan cover, dismount the fan 
motor from the housing (usually one or two screws) and inspect the exhaust port 
of the housing. The damper should be located in the first few inches of the 
exhaust port. 
</P>
<P>
If no damper is found at the fan housing exhaust port or at the exterior of the 
home where the duct for the fan terminates, then certainly one should be added. 
This can usually be accomplished most easily by inserting a damper between the 
exhaust fan housing and the exhaust duct. Dampers are available in various 
diameters from heating and sheet metal products supply stores such as AMFAC 
Mechanical. 
</P>
<P>
Although duct dampers are an important part of infiltration control, there is 
far more to consider. The potential for leaks between the outside and inside of 
your home is quite high and they can occur in many locations. 
</P>
<P>
Gaskets can be installed behind electrical plug and switch covers on exterior 
walls for about 15 cents per location. 
</P>
<P>
Gaskets at doors and windows have a tendency to wear out. Replacements can 
substantially reduce air infiltration. As our home shifts so does the door shoe 
at the bottom of exterior doors. When this shoe is out of adjustment or worn, 
tremendous amounts of unconditioned air can pass unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
If your home has a wood floor or an attic, an inspection of these areas should 
be made. Holes in these areas are invisible from within the house and can allow 
air to pass far too freely. Sewer lines, water pipes and heat ducts penetrating 
through wood floors and ceilings are all candidates for spray foam insulation 
at the point of penetration. 
</P>
<P>
Even if your walls, attic and sub-floors are all completely insulated 
infiltration control is still an extremely important part of making your home 
more energy efficient. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric has a wonderful book out called "30 Simple Energy 
Things You Can Do to Save the Earth." On Page 33 it says heating experts 
estimate that 99% of all houses in America with central furnaces or air 
conditioners have duct leaks. The book explains that up to 10% of heating or 
cooling costs can be saved by insulating and tightening up ducts. It lists 35 
other free PG&amp;E publications that deal with energy saving subjects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Whom to Call When Screens Need Mending 
</P>
<P>
Q: Thirty years ago we added a family room with sliding glass door and matching 
screen. Recently, the latch on the screen door broke. I can't find anyone to 
come to my home to install a new latch and lock. Help! I'm tired of batting 
flies and bugs -- not to mention dogs who use their noses to open the screen 
door. 
</P>
<P>
A: A simple devise such as a broken screen door latch can turn a home into 
something akin to the San Diego Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
The same company that you call to repair broken windows, replace torn screens 
and adjust or repair sliding glass door rollers, can be hired to fix the latch 
on a sliding (or swinging) screen door. Look under "Screens" in the Yellow 
Pages. Looking under the glass section might confuse the issue, but should be 
kept in mind as an alternative. Many glass companies do not work on screens. 
</P>
<P>
Or why not call on a local handyman? The cost of the repair is unquestionably 
less than $300, and for that reason a licensed contractor is not required to do 
the work. Check with friends and neighbors for a referral. 
</P>
<P>

2 Tests Recommended For Smoking Chimney 
</P>
<P>
Q: We would like your help with a problem fireplace before we re-roof our 
16-year-old one-story house. The chimney is clean, but it smokes. We think it 
isn't drawing properly. The problem has to be the design. It has never worked 
properly. Can it be made taller, or should it be redesigned and rebuilt? Should 
we have a designer take a look at it? 
</P>
<P>
A: You could make the chimney taller, and it may help, but that's an expensive 
proposition. And, yes you can redesign and rebuild, but doing that would be 
even more expensive. What we need to do here is some testing to find out what 
the flaw in the design is. By the way -- your problem is not at all uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
You are right. If the chimney is clean (we are assuming that you have checked 
the spark arrester -- and that it is also clean), and the fireplace has always 
smoked, there is undoubtedly a design flaw. We occasionally see unusual weather 
conditions causing smoking at the fireplace, but apparently your problem is 
ongoing, so the weather can't be the snag. 
</P>
<P>
Two tests will help you determine the source of the problem. Clean the bottom 
of your firebox and place a layer of fire bricks on the bottom. (No mortar is 
needed for the test.) The bricks will effectively raise the base of the 
fireplace nearer to the chimney throat, and may in itself solve the problem. We 
wouldn't suggest trying this with more than two layers unless you have an 
unusually high opening (36 inches or more). 
</P>
<P>
Don't place and test the second layer of fire brick until you have tested the 
fireplace with the first one. Be sure not to try this test on an extremely 
windy day. High winds will cause even the best of fireplaces to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
If two layers work better than one, but the problem still isn't completely 
solved, then try the other test. Leave the floor of the firebox at its newly 
elevated level (whichever worked best -- one or two layers), and go up on the 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
Chip away the mortar at the spark arrester to expose the chimney flue liner. 
The flue liner is cement-like usually oval. Make a template of the liner with a 
sheet of tinfoil or cardboard. Take the template to a brick yard and get enough 
matching flue liner to increase the height of the chimney two feet. 
</P>
<P>
Stack the new flue liners on top of the fireplace (or one at a time if you wish 
to do two tests), and place a wire mesh screen on top to prevent sparks from 
escaping into your neighborhood.

If you're eyeing your garage to use for storage and/or work space, there are 
several ways to find the space you need within your available space. 
</P>
<P>
Before you start installing shelves, cabinets and work tables, make a list of 
exactly what you'll be storing. Bear in mind as you make the list that the 
garage was never meant to house unused furniture and personal belongings that 
won't hold up under the elements. 
</P>
<P>
Some things are correctly stored in the garage (such as gardening equipment, 
hardware, tools, paint, and some sports equipment), but other things should 
never be put in the garage at all. Even in the cleanest garage, dirt, dust, 
dampness, bugs and rodents can be prevalent. 
</P>
<P>
If you are already storing things such as clothes, books, papers, and unused 
furniture in the garage and you want extra space to store even more things, you 
should first go through what you already have stored in the garage. Chances are 
that a good portion of it will be ruined, and you'll have to throw much of it 
away (particularly if the items have been in the garage for some time). You may 
decide too, that much of what is stored in the garage is no longer used or 
needed, and can therefore be given away. 
</P>
<P>
If you are committed to storing personal things in the garage, pack everything 
in clean boxes and label the boxes on all sides. If you must keep papers in the 
garage, they are best stored either in Transfile boxes (available at office 
supply stores) or in a sturdy filing cabinet (you can probably pick up a 
second-hand cabinet for this). 
</P>
<P>
You'll want to store everything off the floor on shelves or in cabinets. 
Inexpensive metal shelving is available at building supply and variety stores. 
These shelves can be assembled and placed along the walls of the garage for 
instant organized storage space. 
</P>
<P>
When you shop for the metal shelves, also look for some strong hooks that can 
be attached to the wall or ceiling beams of the garage. These can be used to 
hang anything that has a loop or open space that could conceivably be draped 
over a hook. 
</P>
<P>
For example, you can hang your lawn furniture, some long garden tools, large 
extension cords and garden hose on these hooks. You can even hang your bicycle 
on hooks (available at bicycle shops). 
</P>
<P>
To establish an immediate work area, a trip to a discount office furniture 
store can net you a very sturdy 4- to 6-foot table for less than $50. These 
tables provide work space for gardening, hobby or fix-it projects, and can be 
collapsed to store flat or to be moved as needed. 
</P>
<P>
Tools and supplies can be stored in an old dresser or cabinet, or from a 
Pegboard and hook system attached to the wall over the table. The Pegboard and 
hooks can be purchased at hardware or building supply stores. 
</P>
<P>
Another way to store tools is to buy tool organizers made by Rubbermaid. These 
tool organizers snap onto a tool center Wall Strip (also made by Rubbermaid) or 
can be mounted on Pegboard with adapters or brackets, or directly onto a wall 
with screws. 
</P>
<P>
These tool organizers include a screwdriver rack, wrench rack, hooks that can 
hold a variety of tools and accessories, parts bins for nails, nuts, bolts and 
small parts, clip hooks that hold notes or instructions, and a tool rack 
designed to hold wrenches, putty knives, pencils, punches, shears, pliers and 
other small tools. 
</P>
<P>
Rubbermaid also makes recycling containers for used automotive batteries, as 
well as heavy-duty weather resistant storage containers with lids that fit 
tightly to keep moisture out. These containers come in 3-, 10-, 14- and 
18-gallon sizes and can hold everything from small tools to larger tools such 
as a skill saw or a piece of bulky gardening equipment. 
</P>
<P>
For a sleek, clean look, you may want to have closed cabinetry installed in 
your garage. These modular cabinets come in a range of colors, styles and 
materials, and usually feature interior shelves that are adjustable, some 
drawer space and a countertop that provides work space with an area above it 
for a Pegboard and hook system for tools. 
</P>
<P>
While these cabinets help keep things cleaner because they are behind closed 
doors, you'll need to take the door clearance factor into consideration before 
you have them installed. Make sure that even with your car in the garage, you 
will have enough room to open the cabinet doors so that you access to the 
contents without moving the car. 
</P>
<P>
Firms specializing in closet systems often also install these garage cabinet 
systems to maximize the organization and storage capacity in the garage.

COMMERCIAL SCENE: L.A.'S BIG CONVENTION BUSINESS IS MOVING ON; 
</P>
<P>
TOURISM: ONCE RANKED AS A LEADING SITE FOR THE LUCRATIVE CONVENTION INDUSTRY, 
LOS ANGELES IS TAKING A BACK SEAT TO OTHER CITIES, INCLUDING NEARBY ANAHEIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON GALPERIN, Galperin is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer who has 
covered the commercial real estate scene for several years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles is losing out to other cities across the United States in the 
lucrative convention and tourism business. No longer is the city ranked as a 
top U.S. convention site, and Anaheim's more spacious facilities have more than 
four times as many national conventions booked through 1994 as Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons are many. City officials, downtown landowners and convention 
organizers all agree that the major problems include an acute shortage of hotel 
rooms and continued delays in city plans to expand and upgrade the aging 
Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
Some already-booked L.A. conventions are looking to pull out of their 
commitments as they get word of all the foot-dragging that seems to be going 
on. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the city issued $350 million in bonds to finance a Convention Center 
expansion that was to be done this year. That prediction was later changed to 
1992, then 1993, and now there is talk of completion in perhaps 1994. 
</P>
<P>
While the City Council in 1988 approved an original engineering estimate of 
$243 million, the lowest bid submitted this year was for $287 million. After 
plenty of debate over how to handle the escalating costs, the Convention Center 
Authority decided June 21 to award the construction to low bidders George Hyman 
Construction Co. of Baltimore and M. A. Mortensen Co. of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Now the City Council must approve a plan of finance that essentially allows the 
project to go over budget. The council is expected to take the issues up within 
the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 28 acres of land cleared over a year ago for a 
350,000-square-foot exhibition hall stand idle. 
</P>
<P>
Things aren't much better across the street on the east side of Figueroa Street 
at Pico Boulevard, site of the planned Pacific Basin Plaza hotel project. 
</P>
<P>
The Community Redevelopment Agency, which is responsible for finding a 
developer for the project, spent more than nine months negotiating with Calmark 
Commercial Development Inc. The negotiations finally broke down this spring and 
on May 25, the CRA sent out a new request for proposals (RFP) to the five 
owners of the block bounded by Figueroa, Pico, Flower Street and 12th Street. 
</P>
<P>
The 1.9 million square-foot hotel/office/retail complex is considered an 
important part of the Convention Center's expansion plans and city officials 
are anxious too see the projects 1,781 guest rooms become a reality. 
</P>
<P>
Northview Corp., a subsidiary of Uri Sheinbaum's Calmark Holding Corp., filed 
for bankruptcy protection in March. His company still has an interest in the 
Pride Partnership, which is one of several owners of the proposed Pacific Basin 
hotel site. Other owners include the Waxman Family Trust, investor Chit Young, 
the City of Los Angeles and Ohbayashi America Corp. Ohbayashi controls more 
than two-thirds of the site and reports that its agreement to let Calmark 
negotiate on its behalf with the CRA has expired. 
</P>
<P>
Ohbayashi is now shopping for a joint venture partner to help build Pacific 
Basin -- preferably, executives say, an American company. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its involvement in several U.S. projects, said executive vice president 
Kuni Aoto, "We have no expertise to develop by ourselves in the United States. 
We have to rely on other people." As for the company's search for a new 
partner, he said negotiations are "very sensitive . . . I still do not have any 
conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
Ohbayashi is expected to pick a joint venture partner sometime in July. The CRA 
will then review Ohbayashi's development proposal plus any alternative 
proposals that may surface from other owners on the block. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Downtown L.A. First in Permits 
</P>
<P>
Look for abundant construction activity this year in downtown Los Angeles, the 
Simi Valley, Rancho Cucamonga, Newhall and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
These areas posted the highest dollar amount in building permits issued in 1989 
throughout the five-county megalopolis we call Los Angeles. Western Economic 
Research Co. Inc. of Van Nuys collected this building permit data by ZIP codes 
and L.A. Area Chamber of Commerce chief economist Jack Kyser organized the 
numbers into a report. 
</P>
<P>
Among the findings: Downtown Los Angeles rated tops with a total of $445.4 
million in recorded permits last year for commercial, residential and municipal 
development in ZIP codes 90015 and 90014. The total for six downtown ZIP codes 
posting significant new building permits in 1989 was $683.1 million compared to 
$326.9 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley ZIP code 93064 was right behind downtown Los Angeles with $167.1 
million in mostly residential and industrial construction planned. Rancho 
Cucamonga was next with $140.5 million in planned development within ZIP code 
zone 91730. Irvine ZIPs 92714, 92718 and 92715 are slated for a total of $272.2 
million in mostly commercial construction activity and Anaheim is slated for 
another $178.2 million in mostly residential development within two ZIP code 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
Turning back to Los Angeles County, it took less planned activity in 1989 to 
make the top of the list than the year before -- indicating a slowdown in many 
areas. Newhall (91350) was number three on the L.A. County list with $131.6 
million in planned construction activity in 1989 compared to $165.4 the year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
Calabasas (91302) was fourth on the L.A. County list with $106.8 in development 
planned last year, almost all of it residential, compared to $247.8 million the 
year before. 
</P>
<P>
Other areas worthy of note include Brentwood (90049) with $94.5 million in 
permitted construction, West L.A. (90025) which posted $89.7 million in planned 
projects, LAX (90045) with $74.9 million, Westwood (90024) with $73.8 million 
and El Segundo (90245) with $73.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Areas with less activity than expected include Lancaster/Palmdale, Long Beach 
and South Orange County. As it has for years, South Central Los Angeles remains 
inactive. 
</P>
<P>
Most permitted projects, reported Kyser, get built within about two years of 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SALES: USC Converts May Co. Structures to Garages 
</P>
<P>
USC has acquired three May Co. warehouses on 4.4 acres south of downtown Los 
Angeles, and the university plans to convert the structures into a 2,000-car 
parking facility. 
</P>
<P>
USC is paying $15.5 million for the property, which has been valued in excess 
of $29 million. May Co., in turn, will get a hefty tax deduction for the 
difference and recognition as the biggest corporate donor to the institution's 
six-year fund-raising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The warehouses -- six stories high and totaling 1.1 million square feet -- are 
located just east of the Harbor Freeway along Jefferson Boulevard. The need for 
campus parking has grown acute in recent years and the university projects a 
total of 4,000 current parking spaces will be lost over the next 20 years to 
make way for more campus construction. 
</P>
<P>
The new USC Parking Center is less than two blocks from USC and less than a 
block away from USC Plaza, a large hotel and office project being planned by 
USC's Real Estate Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Ruby Construction Co. of Los Angeles and Turner Development Co. of 
Montclair have acquired 35 acres in Montclair and plan to begin construction in 
July on the $42.4-million Turner Montclair Center, a mixed-use, multi-tenant 
business park. 
</P>
<P>
SDC Development of Newport Beach has acquired 31 acres in Ontario from Los 
Angeles-based BKY Investments Inc. and plans to build a $40-million business 
park just off the Pomona (60) Freeway. The project will include 156,000 square 
feet of industrial space and 206,000 square feet of showroom space, anchored by 
a 40,000-square-foot Levitz Furniture Store. 
</P>
<P>
The Koll Co. of Newport Beach and Ohbayashi America Corp. have purchased 297 
acres of land for $32 million from Union Pacific Realty in the Mira Loma 
section of Riverside County; a new business park is planned. The two developers 
are already cooperating on the $200-million 550 South Hope building project in 
downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, Boise Cascade Corp. has purchased 27 acres in the 190-acre Empire 
Business Center from developer Mira Loma Ventures. Plans call for construction 
of a 200,000-square-foot facility at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West Ontario Associates has purchased 577,000 square feet of industrial 
space comprising the Etiwanda Distribution Center for $11.4 million. One of the 
two buildings involved in the deal is completed and leased. A second building 
is set for completion in September. 
</P>
<P>
TCW Realty Advisors has bought 11812 San Vicente Blvd. in Brentwood for more 
than $20 million from Coral Plaza Ltd. The 68,000-square-foot building is 88% 
occupied but has a ground-floor bank branch standing empty. Brokers involved in 
the deal include Auerbach Financial Ltd., the Klabin Co., Lowe Associates and 
Jack Shanfeld Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate broker Fred Sands has acquired the Wilbur Medical Plaza in Tarzana 
for $9 million from the Resolution Trust Corp. The three-story, 52,264 office 
building is located at 5620 Wilbur Ave. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LEASES: Law Firm Renews at South Coast Plaza 
</P>
<P>
Law firm Rutan &amp; Tucker renewed its lease for five floors of office space 
at South Coast Plaza Town Center's Central Bank Tower in a deal worth an 
aggregate of $25 million. Since locating at South Coast Plaza in 1981, the firm 
has doubled in size and will now fill 90,000 square feet.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Professional baseball has not held many surprises for Roger Salkeld. 
</P>
<P>
Although just 19, the big right-hander from Saugus High already has completed 
overpowering stints in a rookie league dominated by former college players and 
an instructional league full of some of baseball's top prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Chosen by the Seattle Mariners with the third pick overall in the 1989 draft, 
Salkeld is ascending as expected toward the Kingdome and the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
This season, he is pitching for the San Bernardino Spirit, the Mariners' 
affiliate in the Class-A California League. 
</P>
<P>
Sitting in the bullpen last week before a game against the Bakersfield Dodgers, 
Salkeld cast his Mariner blue eyes upon the diamond and spoke matter-of-factly 
about his station. 
</P>
<P>
"The playing conditions got better and the competition got better, that's about 
what I expected," Salkeld said of his promotion to the California League. "I 
haven't been real surprised by anything that's happened since I signed. You 
show up and you play. You're here to have fun and move up as fast as you can." 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld, 6-foot-5, 215 pounds, has been moving through the Mariners' system 
about as quickly as one of his 90-m.p.h. fastballs closes in on a batter. 
</P>
<P>
Last July, after concluding a high school career in which he was 30-7 with 404 
strikeouts in 266 1/3 innings, Salkeld signed a contract that included a cash 
bonus of $225,000. 
</P>
<P>
His first stop was Bellingham, Wash., in the Northwest League where he started 
six games. He finished 2-2 with a 1.29 earned-run average and 55 strikeouts in 
42 innings. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners were not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, any time you take a guy No. 1 and give him the money we gave him, we 
expect good things," said Roger Jongewaard, the Mariners' vice president of 
scouting and player development. 
</P>
<P>
After an impressive performance in an Arizona instructional league last fall, 
Salkeld is 4-4 with a 3.93 ERA and 80 strikeouts in 75 2/3 innings this season. 
Despite being sidelined almost all of April because of an ankle injury, Salkeld 
was selected to play in the California League All-Star game that was held June 
19. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got better command of pitches this year," Salkeld said. "I've got a 
better breaking ball and better changeup. 
</P>
<P>
"My fastball right now isn't as good as it was last year, but I'm slowly 
getting it back." 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld is happy to be working out the kinks in baseball-mad San Bernardino, to 
which his parents Bill and Elaine can drive from Saugus to see him pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great place to play," Salkeld said. "You get support every night." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, not even 100-degree heat and occasional throat-choking smog deter 
Spirit fans who regularly pack Fiscalini Field and have made the 4-year-old San 
Bernardino operation one of the most successful Class-A franchises in the minor 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to Spirit Land read billboards that dot the area around the 3,600-seat 
stadium. The franchise, owned in part by actor Mark Harmon, has flourished 
since it was moved from Ventura and has gained as much notoriety for its 
stadium cuisine as for the performance of its players. 
</P>
<P>
Just beyond the bleachers along the right-field line sits Cafe Spirit, an 
outdoor dining area resplendent with white chairs and colorful umbrellas. 
</P>
<P>
Fans catch the Spirit while munching on barbecued steaks, chicken and ribs. 
Reservations are required and the 170-seat cafe is sold out more than 90% of 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
Down the left-field line are more tables and umbrellas, an all-you-can-eat 
Mexican buffet, a bar serving beer and wine, and a pool table. 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld has been a source of entertainment for Spirit fans hungering for the 
kind of excitement that Ken Griffey Jr. provided when he played in San 
Bernardino in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Griffey's name and number (24) are posted on the center-field fence with those 
of former Baltimore Orioles second baseman Rich Dauer, a San Bernardino native 
who managed the Spirit in its inaugural season. 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld's name and the number 22 also might grace the fence one day. 
</P>
<P>
Regular visitors to the stadium's E section already have deigned him worthy of 
consideration. Every time Salkeld starts, they bring cards emblazoned with 
capital Ks and wave them wildly whenever Salkeld notches a strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
"The crowds are bigger and more people who know baseball seem to come out when 
Roger pitches," said Dean Edmonds, a stadium employee. 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld's best outings this season include an appearance against San Jose in 
which he allowed one run and four hits in seven innings. In a start against 
Visalia he gave up a run and four hits in six innings and had 10 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
For all of his popularity, however, Salkeld has not been totally free from 
problems this season. 
</P>
<P>
The ankle injury that forced him to miss much of spring training and the first 
month of the season was sustained not while Salkeld worked on his curve but on 
his turnaround jump shot while playing basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"His agent called us the day before he was supposed to report (for spring 
training) and he said Roger had been to the doctor and was on crutches. As you 
can imagine, that made us very happy," Jongewaard recalled, tongue in cheek. 
</P>
<P>
After rehabilitating the ankle and rejoining the Spirit, Salkeld suffered 
through a slow start. He had four consecutive no-decisions, lost two games in a 
row and had to leave another after two innings when a blister developed on his 
finger. 
</P>
<P>
And as the second half of the season began two weeks ago, Salkeld was still 
battling to regain the control he displayed last season when he walked 10 
batters in 42 innings. This season, he has issued 44 walks in 75 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a ways to go before I feel really comfortable on the mound," Salkeld 
said. "I'm struggling a little throwing strikes and have a few more walks than 
I'd like to have. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's just mental. When I have to make pitches, I'll make them and when 
I don't have to I usually don't. I have to concentrate from start to end." 
</P>
<P>
Spirit Manager Keith Bodie attributes some of Salkeld's struggles to the level 
of competition in the California League. 
</P>
<P>
"He's never had trouble throwing strikes because people probably used to swing 
at everything he threw," Bodie said. "He's facing better hitters and they're 
not swinging at some of the same pitches." 
</P>
<P>
Bodie said Salkeld is certain to overcome his control problems as he improves 
his mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like when you're a kid and the teacher asks you to rub your belly 
and your head at the same time in different directions," Bodie said. "It's 
difficult to work on mechanical things and throw strikes at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a process that takes time." 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld said he is in no hurry to reach the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"I just take it day by day," he said. "I've always been that way." 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners say they will not rush Salkeld to the big leagues before he is 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
But they also think the day is not far when Salkeld will be pitching against 
the Oakland A's instead of the Modesto A's. 
</P>
<P>
"Next year, with another instructional league and another spring training, 
he'll easily pitch double-A, maybe triple-A," Jongewaard said. "It just depends 
on him, really, and maybe not his arm but his maturity. 
</P>
<P>
"If he seems like he can handle it, he might be in the big leagues."

SANTA CLARITA VALLEY: WITH THE COMPLETION OF FREEWAYS, AREA HAS SEEN RAPID 
POPULATION INCREASES. DESPITE TRAFFIC SNARLS, IT RETAINS SOME OF ITS RUSTIC 
PAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON ROSE, Sharon Rose is a free-lance writer and a former Santa Clarita 
resident who nows lives in Bishop, Calif. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1875, an auctioneer from Saugus, Mass., bought a 48,000-acre ranch for about 
$98,000 in the next valley north of the San Fernando Mission. Ravaged by the 
1857 earthquake and the 1862 drought, the land was bereft. Cattle ranching and 
farming had ceased. 
</P>
<P>
More than a century later, commuters ease off freeway exits onto tree-lined 
parkways, past billboards that beckon, "Come home to Valencia." Today, the 
$98,000 that pioneer Henry Mayo Newhall paid for his ranch, would just about 
buy a condo in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Mary and Dick Ellefson paid just under $300,000 for their townhome in the 
Stratford Collection, built by Warmington Homes in the Valencia Summit 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"We just love the openness of Santa Clarita," said Mary Ellefson, an 
advertising secretary at a local newspaper whose husband works for Department 
of Water and Power in Los Angeles. "There are so many things to do outdoors -- 
there's tennis, swimming, Jacuzzi." 
</P>
<P>
Their townhome was a move-up buy for the Ellefsons, who purchased their first 
Valencia home for about $60,000 in 1977, when they moved from Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
"We had outgrown our home," Mary Ellefson said. "And bussing was about to 
begin. We didn't want our daughter bussed to Los Angeles. We started looking 
out here and fell in love with it." 
</P>
<P>
While many Santa Clarita residents complain about traffic, she thinks the 
problem is solvable. 
</P>
<P>
"The traffic is unfortunate, but we're already seeing improvements with new 
roads that are going in. This is still a great place to raise children. It's 
such a relaxed atmosphere. I really wouldn't want to live anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Nestled between Interstate 5, the Antelope Valley (14) Freeway and the Angeles 
National Forest, the Santa Clarita Valley encompasses Saugus, Newhall, 
Valencia, Canyon Country, Castaic, Agua Dulce and Val Verde. The city of Santa 
Clarita, incorporated two years ago, includes most of Newhall, Saugus, Valencia 
and Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
Although Newhall and Saugus had existed since the late 1800s, it was the 
opening of master-planned Valencia in the 1960s that put the Santa Clarita 
Valley on the affordable-housing map. Valencia's carefully planned 
neighborhoods, linked to parks, pools, business and schools by a system of 
lighted pathways known as paseos, have become a model for the home building 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
But up until the mid-1960s and construction of Interstate 5 and the Antelope 
Valley (14) Freeway, the Santa Clarita Valley remained a sleepy little 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Some Angelenos may remember taking a Sunday drive out to Saugus or Newhall and 
lunch at the Saugus Cafe. The area was a place to ride motorcycles or horses, 
to buy vegetables, to target shoot or just smell the sagebrush. 
</P>
<P>
But live there? Maybe, if you had a job at Thatcher Glass, Bermite or Newhall 
Land &amp; Farming. 
</P>
<P>
The postwar housing boom in the San Fernando Valley stopped just north of 
Granada Hills. But developers, aware that the Valley would one day fill to 
capacity, envisioned houses "over the hill." Throughout the 1950s and '60s, ads 
announced new homes in Saugus and Newhall, priced from $15,000 to $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
The North Oaks tract appeared in Canyon Country. The first American Beauty 
Homes went in. Then in 1967, coinciding with the opening of northbound 
Interstate 5 and the Antelope Valley Freeway, Newhall Land &amp; Farming opened 
Valencia, and the valley began changing rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember riding through there as a little boy," says Jerry Reynolds, author 
and curator of the Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents had stopped for Cokes at the Saugus Cafe. I was sitting in the back 
seat of the car, looking out the window and thinking how desolate it was. 
People were milling about in bib overalls." 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, Reynolds and his wife, Myrna, bought a home in Newhall for $23,000. It 
was quiet. People were riding horses around and walking everywhere. They'd stop 
and say hello. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it has mushroomed into a monstrosity not fit to live in," he said. 
"Developers have built a nightmare. You can't get anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Between 1960 and 1970, the Santa Clarita Valley's population leaped from 15,000 
to 50,000. By 1980, the count had reached 79,000. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1980s, as the possibility of incorporation loomed, growth quickened. 
Wary that cityhood might bring limits on growth, developers filled in the 
landscape at a rapid rate. By 1990, population estimates hovered at around 
135,000. 
</P>
<P>
As the San Fernando Valley matured, employment opportunities increased. 
Scarcely a 15-minute drive from the San Fernando Valley, Santa Clarita became 
an ideally located bedroom community. 
</P>
<P>
Named by the Spaniards who visited it in 1769 on the feast day of St. Clare, 
the Santa Clarita Valley existed for almost 200 years in relative isolation. 
</P>
<P>
Wedged between three mountain ranges, the Sierra Pelona to the north, the San 
Gabriels to the east and the Santa Susanas to the south, the history of the 
90-square mile valley is a Reader's Digest of the American West. 
</P>
<P>
Here beside the Santa Clara River, the cultural light of the Tatavium Indians 
faded, only to be replaced by the metallic glint of barbed wire, missionary 
crosses and gold. Here in Placerita Canyon, California's first placer gold was 
discovered in 1842. Later came railroads and the discovery of oil, all 
contributing to the growth of the little pueblo to the south known as Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Early Hollywood filmmakers also were attracted to Santa Clarita's gently 
folded, golden, oaken hills, its rugged canyons and purple sunsets. It was 
perfect for Western landscape photography. 
</P>
<P>
As early as 1914, William S. Hart used Newhall and Placerita Canyon for 
location shooting. Actor Harry Carey had a ranch and trading post in San 
Francisquito Canyon. Hoot Gibson bought a rodeo arena named Baker Ranch Stadium 
(now Saugus Speedway). Tom Mix, John Wayne and Clark Gable all appeared there. 
John Ford directed films in Newhall and Saugus, using Beale's Cut, a trail for 
wagon trains, as a set. 
</P>
<P>
When Hart died, his beautiful Spanish adobe mansion and land was bequeathed to 
the county as a park, which today features areas for picnic and play and a 
petting zoo, and is neighbor to historic Heritage Junction park and the old 
Saugus Train Station/Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The valley retained its ranching and farming identity well into the middle of 
this century. But as Los Angeles became urbanized, the growth spread northward 
in the 1950s and 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time, the county tax assessor began to tax ranches as residential," 
said Carol Maglione, a spokesperson for Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co. The 
Newhall family, as the valley's largest landholder, would pay higher taxes and 
see their agricultural operations surrounded by residential development. 
</P>
<P>
"They decided to build a master-planned community," Maglione said. "They wanted 
it to be a self-contained community, complete with infrastructure, industrial 
parks, recreation and shopping." 
</P>
<P>
Named for the oranges grown on the Newhall ranch, Valencia is the result of a 
master plan for 10,500 acres. According to Maglione, about 5,000 acres have 
been developed, with 600 acres now under development in the North River 
planning area. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, many Southland home builders have brought projects to the Santa 
Clarita Valley, including Brock, Pardee, American Beauty, Warmington, Larwin, 
Griffin Homes, Shapell, Valencia Co. (owned by Newhall Land) and Dale Poe 
Development. 
</P>
<P>
The median-priced new home in the Santa Clarita Valley is $240,000, according 
to Eric C. Brown, a vice president at the Meyers Group, a real estate 
consulting firm. The average price for new condos and townhomes is $149,000. 
</P>
<P>
Resale prices vary, due to the range of differences in communities -- from 
large ranch-style properties with room for horses, to modern suburban tracts. 
</P>
<P>
For example, average prices range from $145,500 and $195,500 in Val Verde and 
Canyon Country, respectively, to $227,000 in Saugus to $274,900 in Valencia. In 
Agua Dulce, where parcels frequently run to a few acres, the average price for 
existing detached homes is $409,000. 
</P>
<P>
Resales in prestigious Valencia Summit, built by Warmington Homes, range from 
$300,000 to $900,000. Condominiums average from $128,900 in Newhall to $300,000 
in Valencia Summit. 
</P>
<P>
Primarily escapees from the San Fernando Valley, most Santa Clarita home buyers 
are two-income families. Many are in the child-rearing years; they come in 
search of good schools, safe neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Linda and Steve Kassel, professionals in their early 30s, are move-ups from a 
condominium. After searching Los Angeles for an affordable new home, they came 
to the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the only place we could afford to buy a new house without moving out 
of the area away from our jobs and families," said Linda Kassel, mother of 
18-month-old Sasha and a high school English teacher. 
</P>
<P>
During their house hunt, the Kassels came upon Stevenson Ranch, built by Dale 
Poe Development. They fell in love with a house in a neighborhood called The 
Arts. 
</P>
<P>
"We saw the model in early 1989," Linda Kassel said. "Then we had to be on a 
waiting list and be chosen in a lottery." The Kassels purchased their 
two-bedroom plus convertible den home for $188,000 in early 1989. By October, 
it was ready for occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Kassel, a biofeedback therapist and counselor, said the couple wanted to 
live closer to the city, but couldn't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to this area as a film student at CalArts (California Institute of the 
Arts), and always expected I'd return to West L.A. near my family," he said. 
"But it's too expensive there now. And too congested. After a while, I started 
to like it here. There's a bigger sky." 
</P>
<P>
The Kassels say they're happy with their home purchase. They like the 
community. They love the house, the yard, the view of rolling hills out front. 
But there are a few concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"We may have to pay about $4,000 in taxes for schools and roads that we were 
not prepared for," said Steve Kassel, who doesn't think it's fair. "Developers 
appear to be wriggling out of their obligations." 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Clarita, everyone talks about roads. Everyone talks about traffic. And 
just about everyone blames developers. 
</P>
<P>
"People have to live somewhere," said Jack Shine, president of First Financial 
Group in Encino and builder of American Beauty homes in Santa Clarita for more 
than 20 years. "Developers have responded to a market demand for housing." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Santa Clarita's growth problems, people want to live there. What looks 
bad to those who knew the valley "in the good old days," looks good to pilgrims 
from Van Nuys, Burbank and Sylmar -- weary of thickening densities of 
buildings, people and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
An Easterner, seeing Santa Clarita for the first time, might chuckle at this 
vision of "Western City," sprawled over 40 square miles, with not a high-rise 
in sight and parking spaces galore. Generic modern shopping centers stand 
beside old adobe buildings, with aging wooden hitching posts out front. 
</P>
<P>
In some parts of town, kids ride ponies around the block like Big Wheels. This 
is Santa Clarita, a clash of Wild West and ultramodern, a place where status 
means having no sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita's identification with Hollywood and the West is real. Downtown, 
in old Newhall, sidewalks are etched with stars containing the names of Western 
movie greats. Over at the Way Station, breakfast is served amid posters and 
memorabilia from the early days. Biscuits and gravy are still a staple at the 
Saugus Cafe, where James Dean is said to have eaten his last meal. 
</P>
<P>
Every autumn around harvest time, a three-day rodeo and Western Frontier Days 
is sponsored by the Canyon Country Chamber of Commerce, complete with parade 
and beauty pageant selecting a Frontier Belle. 
</P>
<P>
It was Placerita Canyon that gave birth to Monogram Studios, which later became 
Gene Autry's Melody Ranch. Today, the Disney film lot is an enchanting view 
from the road. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the stuntmen and animal trainers who came to the valley for film work, 
later settled to raise kids and horses on small ranchettes. Lassie, Arnold the 
Pig, and even a horse from the Spuds McKenzie Budweiser commercials are among 
the famous animal stars trained in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime valley observer Ruth Newhall said roads and schools are crowded 
because "the county supervisors allowed developers to do anything they wanted 
out here." For 25 years, Ruth and Scott Newhall, a member of the pioneer 
family, published the Newhall Signal (and later the short-lived Citizen), 
documenting and criticizing the development of their cherished valley. 
</P>
<P>
It was largely perceptions of overdevelopment that led to incorporation of the 
city of Santa Clarita in December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"People may be expecting too much too soon from the new city," says City 
Councilman Carl Boyer. "The city has had to live with a lot of county planning 
and zoning entitlements that were handed out in a rush just prior to 
incorporation." 
</P>
<P>
Traffic, Boyer said, will cease to be a problem when there is less commuting 
and more people working in the valley where they live. 
</P>
<P>
"As a new city, I think we should work with industry and employers to find ways 
to get people into owner-occupied housing. Maybe people who work here should 
get first choice on homes." 
</P>
<P>
The councilman is concerned about the growing number of renters who cannot 
afford to buy in Santa Clarita. "I'd like to see our city require some kind of 
affordable housing so people don't have to drive to Los Angeles for big-paying 
jobs." 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Clarita is gaining jobs as it grows," notes Jim Lewis, executive vice 
president of the Santa Clarita Board of Realtors. "The people who voted for 
cityhood wanted to make sure we have the infrastructure to provide the things 
people move here for, like good schools and open space. They didn't want the 
county making decisions for them, some 40 miles away. They wanted controlled 
growth." 
</P>
<P>
Since incorporation, Santa Clarita had begun work on a general plan, negotiated 
a settlement with Arco for no additional co-generation plants in Placerita 
Canyon, and adopted an oak tree ordinance to protect the trees. The city is 
also working with Los Angeles County on a system of trails for walking, 
bicycling and equestrians. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita's greatest achievement since cityhood, according to parks 
commissioner Laurene Weste, "is the establishment of Towsley Canyon Park at our 
doorstep. This was the first purchase for the proposed Santa Clarita Woodlands 
Park. If we get this park, we'll have a forested buffer zone between the Santa 
Clarita and San Fernando valleys. We're going to need it." 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the 6,000-acre Woodlands park would be larger than Griffith Park, 
and provide camping, hiking and other recreational uses for the burgeoning 
populations of two fast-growing valleys. "We have to set aside these areas 
now," Weste says. "before the developers and dumps get them. In the future, the 
land will become unaffordable. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been truly rural since 1972, but this is still a good place to 
live. You can't get away from growth. The answer is planning. Had Valencia not 
been planned, we would look like the San Fernando Valley. I think we've done a 
better job."

ARTS, RIDES AND SUN -- IT'S FESTIVAL TIME; 
</P>
<P>
FAIRS: THOUSANDS VISIT LAGUNA BEACH'S SAWDUST EXHIBITS AND THE FOUNTAIN VALLEY 
FIESTA, BOTH WARMED BY PLEASANT WEATHER.

<P>
In Laguna Beach, people trampled through sawdust while perusing ceramics and 
paintings. About 20 miles to the north, fair-goers passed by a twirling Ferris 
wheel and barking carnival vendors. 
</P>
<P>
Both outdoor festivals -- Laguna Beach's Sawdust Festival and the Fountain 
Valley Fiesta -- offered county residents Saturday a chance to enjoy music, 
arts and crafts and other entertainment while relishing the bright skies and 
pleasant temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Under the shade of several eucalyptus trees, hundreds of people tramped over 
the fine wood chips that have become the trademark of the Sawdust Festival and 
browsed through the original works of more than 250 artists. 
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old festival showcases the talents of the local artists by 
exhibiting their work for two months each summer. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying out this year's theme, "The Magic of Art," were such items as pottery, 
handcrafted wood, stained glass, clothing of all types, jewelry, paintings and 
photography. 
</P>
<P>
Although the opening-day crowd was sparse, organizers are confident that the 
festival will be a success. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first week is always slow," said Tina Arana, director of media relations. 
Last year, 257,000 attended the festival's run, and Arana said she expects at 
least that many people to pass through the gates before the event closes Aug. 
26. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to provide an opportunity for the public to participate in the arts and 
culture," Arana said, noting that demonstration booths featuring glass-blowing 
and sculpting, clay art, face-painting, watercolors and painting are scattered 
throughout the 2 1/2-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, free arts and crafts lessons are offered to children 6 and older 
six times daily on Saturdays and Sundays. During the 45-minute sessions, 
children can work with watercolor paints, clay and construction paper. On 
weekday mornings, 3- to 5-year-olds receive half-hour art lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"I just love working with the children," said Linda Clemence, 44, a preschool 
teacher who has been a fair exhibitor for six years. 
</P>
<P>
The festival also features daily juggling, mime and animal and musical acts. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is $4 for adults, $3 for seniors and free for children under 12 when 
accompanied by an adult. Passes for the duration of the event may be bought for 
$15. Hours are 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sunday through Thursday, and until 11 p.m. 
Friday and Saturday. On Wednesday, the festival will be closed for July 4 until 
5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In Fountain Valley, the Chamber of Commerce's Fiesta got off to its best start 
ever Friday as more than 4,500 people poured through the carnival gates. 
Organizers expect that 50,000 people will visit the grounds at Mile Square Park 
before the event closes Wednesday, Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
"I came out to check out the girls, go on the rides and get away from my 
parents," said one 12-year-old youth who was roaming the grounds with two 
school friends. 
</P>
<P>
Among the main attractions are fair rides, games of chance and assorted vendors 
and booths. Highlights include an appearance Sunday by characters from "The 
Simpsons" TV show; a battle of the bands Monday and a Laser Magic and Fourth of 
July fireworks extravaganza on the final night. 
</P>
<P>
"The chamber started doing it to support its other events and donations to the 
community," said Fiesta coordinator Joel Vest, noting that the chamber has 
donated more than $50,000 in scholarships during the fair's eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Daily general admission is $3 for adults, $1 for children ages 6 to 10 and free 
for children 5 and younger. Hours are 11 a.m. to midnight Sunday through 
Tuesday and 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Wednesday.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: IMMIGRANTS MUST TRAVERSE PAPER JUNGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIA NEWMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pedro Zamora was on the line, calling from a pay phone at Costa Mesa's 
Placentia Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
He had lost his mica, he said -- his identification card from the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service authorizing him to live and work in this country 
legally. And he needed to go down to the nearest INS office to get a new one. 
Could I take him? 
</P>
<P>
Pedro had been one of three people we had profiled in March in a story entitled 
"Life After Amnesty." A recent immigrant from Mexico, Pedro, 23, gained legal 
status two years ago under the 1986 federal amnesty act along with about 
186,000 other immigrants in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
When I met him, he worked as a day laborer, and I had taken up his time by 
following him around as he tried to get jobs through a hiring hall in Costa 
Mesa. I had met his roommates at the tiny apartment on 19th Street that he 
shared with seven other men. Pedro had no telephone and no car. Most of the 
money he earned he sent back to his family in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
The last time we had talked, he was going to Bakersfield to look for work in 
the farm fields, because work for a day laborer in Costa Mesa was scarce. Now 
he was back. 
</P>
<P>
When I was profiling him for the story, I once offered to drive him to the 
Social Security office to apply for a number, he reminded me. For various 
reasons, we had never made it there. But now, when he asked about a ride to the 
INS office, I figured I owed him. 
</P>
<P>
The trip was a chance to catch up with this itinerant farm worker-cum-day 
laborer who lives a life much different from the average Orange County worker. 
Accompanying him as he inquired about his lost card also afforded me an 
opportunity to see how the vast machinery of federal immigration bureaucracy 
treats the hundreds of thousands of people it must keep track of constantly. 
</P>
<P>
We drove into the crowded parking lot, and already the place took on the air of 
a government office in Latin America. Under a blazing sun, a line of people 
streamed out the door and into the parking lot of the INS office, housed in a 
one-story building in a warehouse district. A vendor was selling Paletas de 
Michoacan, ice pops reminiscent of those from the Mexican state of Michoacan, 
famous for its fruit crops. 
</P>
<P>
Some men and women, perhaps waiting for friends or relatives in the line, stood 
under a few trees near the street, watching their small children play among 
parked cars. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of men lingered near the end of the line, handing newcomers flyers for 
vocational schools that offered English language instruction and other skills. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro looked dismayed at what he could tell would be a long wait. We peered 
past the people, and noticed that everyone was waiting to speak to one clerk 
who manned a booth that said "Information." 
</P>
<P>
The Ritchey Street office is one of 10 INS legalization centers throughout the 
Orange-Los Angeles-Ventura county area. The offices are set up to serve the 
needs of those going through the long and complex amnesty process. Many of 
those in line were coming to arrange the last phase of amnesty, the step that 
would get them their permanent residency papers. 
</P>
<P>
Very little of the amnesty paper work can be completed by mail; a personal 
appearance is almost always required. Pedro himself said he has visited INS 
offices at least 10 times in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Because he has no phone, and speaks very little English, Pedro did not call his 
nearest INS office first to see what he would need to apply for a duplicate ID 
card, as I might have. In fact, this trip was precisely for that purpose, just 
to see what it would take. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in the car, he had shown me the documents he had brought with him to 
prove his identity. On a worn bit of paper he had jotted down the ID number 
from the INS card he had lost. He also had a copy of a fake Social Security 
card that he had paid hundreds of dollars for several years ago, back when he 
was still an illegal alien. 
</P>
<P>
I asked him if he thought it would be wise to show INS officials that once he 
had used a fake ID. 
</P>
<P>
"They already know," he said. "They said to keep using the number until I 
applied for a new Social Security card." 
</P>
<P>
He had brought pay stubs from the last regular job he had held, as a laborer 
with a grower in the Bakersfield area. 
</P>
<P>
An INS official hurried past, asking in Spanish if anyone had appointments. She 
told those who said they did that they would be called when they got to the 
front. 
</P>
<P>
Pedro began to ask her about his situation. 
</P>
<P>
She cut him off and told him to wait in line and ask the clerk at the 
information booth. 
</P>
<P>
Thinking I was more savvy in the ways of American bureaucracy, I approached the 
official. In my most businesslike way, and in English, I explained to her that 
he only needed to know what he would have to do to obtain his duplicate ID. Was 
there a form somewhere that he could pick up? 
</P>
<P>
"Wait in this line and ask the clerk when you get to the front," she said, not

Pedro waited in line about a half-hour. When he got to the clerk, she pushed a 
blank form toward him. She listed the types of identification he would need, 
and told him he would need a money order for $15 to pay for the duplicate ID. 
</P>
<P>
And when he had all that, she said, he would need to come in person to submit 
the form.

<P>
As the curtain rose on the Pirate Road Production of "Murder! She Mumbled," a 
mysterious host was preparing to welcome several equally mysterious guests to 
his eerie and mysterious mansion in a Godforsaken and mysterious place called 
Pirate Road. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the curtain lowered on the final act, two dead bodies had been 
discovered, the murderer had been revealed and the residents on the real Pirate 
Road in Newport Beach had savored yet another outstanding production by 
neighbors Joe and Mary Robinson, in what is becoming an annual tradition in 
this Back Bay community. 
</P>
<P>
More than 175 people crowded into the Robinson's front yard Saturday to see 10 
neighborhood youngsters ham their way through two acts of a musical whodunit, 
featuring everybody's favorite sleuth, Agatha Crusty. 
</P>
<P>
It is the third year that the Robinsons, both former schoolteachers, have put 
on a show featuring neighborhood children. And each year the crowds have grown 
larger and more appreciative of the surprisingly polished productions. 
</P>
<P>
The first show two years ago was a lark to give bored neighborhood youngsters, 
newly released from school, something to do. Now the kids and their parents 
won't let the Robinsons quit. 
</P>
<P>
"After the first year, everyone had so much fun we couldn't not do it," said 
Mary, who usually directs the productions. 
</P>
<P>
The Robinsons were also eager to help their own two children develop a healthy 
sense of self-esteem and confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, I would get kids who would come up in front of the class and they 
were so shy," said Joe, who has authored all three productions. "We wanted our 
own kids to grow up and not be shy. I think that's the main purpose of this." 
</P>
<P>
No hint of bashfulness was evident Saturday afternoon as the young thespians, 
who range from 7 to 12 years old, completed their final rehearsal. Most of them 
have performed in all three productions and all say they have been bitten by 
the acting bug. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so much fun, it's something I want to do when I grow up," said Katie 
Dunne, 9, who played the vampish Lola in "Mumbled," but in real life is a star 
soccer player. 
</P>
<P>
Sara, the Robinsons' 12-year-old daughter, whose credits include a South Coast 
Repertory production of "A Christmas Carol," described the hazards of trying to 
perform with the driveway as a stage. 
</P>
<P>
"The heat!" she exclaimed. "And it's kind of hard when the airplanes and cars 
go by. But this year's is the hardest so far because we have more lines to 
learn, and accents too." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, this year's production featured a veddy proper English butler, a French 
maid who is not quite what she seems, a hard-of-hearing count, his upper-crust 
daughter and a Texas tycoon who goes by the improbable name of Rico Verdi. 
</P>
<P>
The plot had something to do with a bankrupt savings and loan, a Nevada ranch 
polluted with toxic waste and the selling of illegal mustard gas to the Irish 
Republican Army. By the end, though, the formidable Crusty had nabbed the 
murderer (it was Lola, after all), the audience had learned a few valuable 
environmental lessons (not recycling the garbage proved to be the cook's 
undoing) and the kids were already clamoring for next year's production. 
</P>
<P>
The Robinsons aren't sure what next year's plot twists will be, but they are 
determined to retain what they call the "quaint, amateur" nature of the popular 
shows. (The Newport Beach Police Department this year gave the family 
permission to block off the street in anticipation of the crowd.) 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we think it would be so much easier being in a building, but we have 
such a great time out here," Mary Robinson said. "The whole neighborhood 
pitches in. I don't know if we want to trade the kind of freedom we have with 
it now."

POLICE TO LIGHT UP REVELERS EXPLODING FIREWORKS ILLEGALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last Fourth of July, fire marshals caught people shooting off fireworks in 
unexpected and illegal places: large parking lots, entrances to housing tracts, 
even in the middle of major intersections. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, these places were all in cities where the sale and use of fireworks 
approved by the state are still legal: Buena Park, Costa Mesa, Fullerton, 
Garden Grove, Orange, Santa Ana and Westminster. But even in these cities, 
shooting fireworks off anywhere but on private property with the owner's 
permission is illegal. A sole exception is in Buena Park, where state-approved 
fireworks can be shot off in city parks. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in Westminster approved a ban on fireworks last month, but the law will 
take effect after this July 4. It is illegal to sell or use any fireworks on 
unincorporated county land. 
</P>
<P>
Fireworks will go on sale today in the seven cities where they are legal. 
</P>
<P>
And with fewer places left where fireworks can be set off legally, fire 
officials have noticed an increasing number of people crossing into those seven 
cities, looking for a handy place to use their fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, we had a tremendous influx on all our borders with cities that 
don't allow fireworks," Fullerton Fire Marshal Marc Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
The northeastern part of the city, where Fullerton shares a large border with 
Brea, had the largest influx of out-of-town residents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it was a trend, but we don't know what it will be like this year," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Revelers often illegally use public parks and school grounds for fireworks, 
creating an increased fire and safety danger, fire marshals said. 
</P>
<P>
"The more people you have coming into town, that just increases the level of 
fireworks activity," Buena Park Fire Marshal Donald Tully said. "And as the 
activity levels go up, that increases the chances of injury and property 
damage." 
</P>
<P>
For the last few Independence Days, Westminster Deputy Fire Marshal Elvis 
Easley has noticed people parking at the entrances to housing developments and 
lighting fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
One place in Fullerton where people with fireworks have gathered for the last 
two years is along Laurel Avenue, a small street that begins in Brea, where 
fireworks are illegal, and ends in Fullerton, where they're legal. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, a huge group of people shot off fireworks in the parking lot of 
Lark Ellen Christian Church on Laurel and "literally trashed" the parking lot, 
the Rev. Robert O. Weitzeil complained to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Weitzeil barricaded the parking lot -- which prompted revelers to 
shoot off fireworks in the street in front of the church, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Cities allowing fireworks typically receive inquiries from out-of-town 
residents in early July. "I've had people from other cities call me on the 
phone and ask me where they can shoot off fireworks in Costa Mesa," Fire 
Marshal Thomas Macduff said. "So I know they think about this." 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton, which informally kept track of the calls last year, got about 50 
requests for a list of places where neighboring residents could light 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials in Costa Mesa, Garden Grove and Santa Ana said they suspect 
people from outside the area come to their cities to shoot off fireworks, but 
their fire inspectors have not reported problems. 
</P>
<P>
In Garden Grove, fire inspector Valerie Bottrell said she has answered about 
three such calls this year from people making early plans. 
</P>
<P>
"And those are the people trying to do the right thing," she said. "Most people 
will just come into the city and find a place to shoot them off." 
</P>
<P>
Callers looking for a good location in one of the seven cities get, almost 
unvariably, the same answer: "Nowhere." 
</P>
<P>
"It is against the municipal code to discharge fireworks in our parks," Santa 
Ana Fire Marshal James Montgomery said. "And the school districts don't allow 
them to be discharged on school property." 
</P>
<P>
With city laws also prohibiting fireworks to be lighted in the street -- 
although fire inspectors said they leave residents alone when using fireworks 
on the street in front of their own homes -- people have almost nowhere left to 
light fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Only Buena Park allows fireworks in its parks, but none will be permitted this 
year in Bellis Park, where Buena Park will sponsor a professional fireworks 
display Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Except for Costa Mesa, cities where fireworks are legal will have special teams 
of police and fire inspectors patrolling the streets Wednesday night, looking 
for illegal fireworks and fireworks being shot off in improper places. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa used to have special patrols but found them ineffective, Macduff 
said, so regular police officers now answer fireworks-related complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Sharing a border with cities where fireworks are legal also creates problems on 
the side where fireworks are outlawed. Anaheim, which bars fireworks, is 
surrounded by cities allowing fireworks. So residents living near the borders 
go down the street to the stands in Fullerton, Buena Park, Garden Grove and 
Orange, buy their fireworks and then bring them back into the city, Anaheim 
Fire Marshal Michael Doty said. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of our (fireworks) problems now are in the fringe areas, where 
surrounding cities sell fireworks," Doty said. "They are problem areas, because 
the kids can walk to the neighborhood stand, purchase fireworks and shoot them 
off. And unfortunately, it's in Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
The problem of being a fireworks city in an increasingly anti-fireworks county 
creates its problems, Fullerton City Councilman Chris Norby said. In October, 
Norby voted in the 3-2 council majority to keep them legal. 
</P>
<P>
"I like (fireworks), and I want to keep them legal," Norby said. "On the other 
hand, it's like if you were the only town that sold alcohol -- your city would 
have everybody at its bars on Saturday night."

A man walking down the middle of a traffic lane on Irvine Center Drive was 
struck from behind and killed Friday night in concert traffic departing nearby 
Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified the dead man as Michael Rubio, 19, of Sylmar. Officers said 
he was struck by a car driven by Patricia Maureen Feldt, 18, of Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
Police said it did not appear that Feldt had been speeding. They said that 
"alcohol may be a factor" in the accident but provided no details.

ANGELS KNUCKLE UNDER; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: THEY CAN'T GET AHEAD OF INDIANS' CANDIOTTI AND SUFFER THEIR FIFTH 
LOSS IN SEVEN GAMES.

<P>
In theory, Tom Candiotti is beatable. Wait until he misses the strike zone a 
couple of times with his knuckleball and gets behind in the count, then he will 
have to throw a breaking ball. "I told every one of them to lay off the 
knuckleball and try to be patient, then he'll throw you a curve," Angel Manager 
Doug Rader said of the advice he gave his players before they faced Candiotti 
Saturday. "I don't think we did a very good job of it." 
</P>
<P>
In practice, Candiotti's knuckler kept him ahead of hitters and forced the 
Angels to go after that maddening pitch. After their 4-1 loss to the Indians at 
Cleveland Stadium, the Angels could do nothing but shrug as helplessly as they 
batted against the Cleveland right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
"You try to get ahead, but he was getting the ball over the plate. If he throws 
two knuckleballs over for strikes, what do you do?" Lance Parrish said after 
Candiotti (9-3) limited the Angels to six hits and one unearned run in seven 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always maintained that if he gives you a good pitch to hit, you hit it," 
Parrish said. "I understand the philosophy behind waiting, but if everybody 
goes up there and swings at the first pitch and hits line drives, you can throw 
that philosophy out the window. He pitched well tonight, that's the bottom 
line." 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line for the Angels was their fifth loss in seven games, dropping 
them 10 1/2 games behind the Oakland Athletics. The bottom line for Angel 
starter Kirk McCaskill was his fourth loss in 10 decisions. McCaskill also was 
displeased by his errant pickoff throw to first in the third inning and the 
resulting unearned run that gave Cleveland a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians had scored in the second on a single by Candy Maldonado, a walk to 
Brook Jacoby and Cory Snyder's single. In the third, Jerry Browne drew a 
leadoff walk -- one of five walks issued by McCaskill -- and drew a throw to 
first with Chris James at bat. McCaskill's throw went beyond the reach of first 
baseman Wally Joyner and rolled down the right-field line, Browne going to 
third. He scored on James' sinking liner to left. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to go out and pitch well every time," McCaskill said. "There are 
times you don't feel good and don't have your rhythm and you've got to not make 
stupid mistakes like that." 
</P>
<P>
McCaskill committed a similar error in his last start last Sunday against 
Detroit, but the Angels won that game, 10-2. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't do a very good job and I'm not happy with the way I went about it," 
McCaskill said. "It's hard to pinpoint why. A lot of things happened. . . . Me 
making a mistake like that cost me a run and it was a different ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps nothing could have changed the outcome because Candiotti -- who 
defeated the Angels, 4-2, May 30 at Anaheim Stadium -- was pitching well enough 
to have made one run stand up. Doug Jones pitched well enough in two relief 
innings to earn his 22nd save of the season and the 100th of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Said Cleveland Manager John McNamara: "The key is Candiotti getting his 
knuckleball over for strikes. He gets it over and they're in trouble. He's 
pitched very consistently. He's had only one bad game where he's been wild with 
(the knuckleball)." 
</P>
<P>
Good as the knuckler was, the Angels still had runners on base in six of the 
first seven innings. Dante Bichette struck out with Devon White at second and 
two outs in the second, and with men on second and third in the third, Chili 
Davis grounded out. They scored in the seventh on a walk to Davis, a single by 
Dave Winfield, a passed ball and White's grounder to the right side. 
</P>
<P>
Donnie Hill made it to third on an infield single followed by two groundouts, 
but shortstop Felix Fermin made a leaping catch on a liner by Joyner to end the 
inning. An eighth-inning leadoff double by Davis -- extending his hitting 
streak to 10 games -- and a single by Parrish put runners at second and third 
with one out, but White struck out on three pitches and pinch-hitter Max 
Venable took a third strike. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels left 10 men on base, seven in scoring position. They have left 96 in 
their last 12 games and 557 this season, among the top totals in the American 
League. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't get anything going, that's for sure," Rader said. "Their ballclub 
was opportunistic. . . . We had chances in the seventh and again in the eighth. 
Had we scored those runs it would have been a much different ballgame, but it 
wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
Rader also fretted that hitting against Candiotti could ruin the Angels' timing 
for days. "Not only does (a knuckleballer) screw you up in the game you're 
playing, but in the next couple," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But that theory also doesn't always hold up. : After losing to Candiotti May 
30, the Angels won their next game. They defeated him May 22 and won the 
following next five games. They also defeated Texas' Charlie Hough. 
</P>
<P>
Theories apparently can be as fickle as knuckleballs. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Second baseman Johnny Ray, who was placed on the 15-day disabled list June 8 
because of a strained right shoulder, was activated Saturday. To make room on 
the 25-man roster, infielder Kent Anderson was optioned to triple-A Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Anderson hit .280 in 31 games and was on the disabled list from May 20 to June 
11 because of shoulder problems. He played mostly at shortstop but had played 
at second base recently. "We as an organization thought it was proper thing to 
do for our roster," Manager Doug Rader said. 
</P>
<P>
Rader altered the pitching rotation to give Chuck Finley a better chance of 
pitching in the All-Star Game, moving Finley up a day to start Monday in 
Cleveland and pushing Bert Blyleven back to Tuesday at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Finley, who ranks among the AL leaders with 10 wins victories and a 2.62 
earned-run average, will pitch again next Saturday and could pitch in the July 
10 All-Star Game on two days' rest. Finley was named voted to last year's 
season's team but didn't pitch. Blyleven, who will get six days' rest between 
starts, didn't mind the switch. "I'm pulling for Chuck to start the All-Star 
Game since I can't make it," he said.

BLYLEVEN CHOOSES TITANS OVER PRO CONTRACT

Bert Blyleven hasn't given up his dream of having his son Todd as an Angel 
teammate, but the Angel pitcher happily postponed it when Todd decided to 
accept a scholarship to Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Blyleven, 18, pitched for Villa Park High School and was selected by the 
Angels in the 39th round of last month's free agent amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
He opted to take a college scholarship instead of turning professional, and he 
did it with his father's blessings. 
</P>
<P>
"Being around the game, seeing guys going up and coming down and not making it 
to the big leagues affected him," Bert Blyleven said. "I'm very proud of him 
for making this decision. He's going to a great program. Vern Ruhle is the 
pitching coach and I played with Vern (in Cleveland in 1985). Vern's a very 
highly qualified pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
"(Todd) got a very nice offer from the Angels. They did offer him schooling and 
a nice signing bonus, but he decided he wanted schooling. I think he's going to 
get just as much out of school." 
</P>
<P>
Blyleven, who has signed a contract extension through next season with options 
for 1992 and '93, still wants to play in the big leagues with his son even 
though he's 39 and Todd may be five years from making it. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm upset I signed for three years," he said, jokingly. "This gives me more 
incentive to play 10 more years."

VOLLEYBALL LAGUNA BEACH OPEN;

<P>
BACK TO THE BEACH, AND WINNING WAYS, FOR HANLEY

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Linda Hanley has returned to the women's pro beach volleyball circuit 
full-time, but she's finding a few changes in the sport she once dominated. 
</P>
<P>
Hanley, who grew up in Laguna Beach and now lives in Pacific Palisades, has 
played in only two or three tournaments a year since 1986, when she was 
undefeated on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
She and Nina Matthies of Oxnard, who now teams with Elaine Roque of Santa 
Barbara, were the top team on the circuit in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
But Hanley said after her matches Saturday at the Laguna Beach Open that the 
tour offers different challenges than it did four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Every single game and every single point I have to try as hard as I can," 
Hanley said. "Unfortunately, in the old days, other players were so intimidated 
by Nina and I that they made mistakes on their own. But now everyone is so 
good, that we have to work harder." 
</P>
<P>
Hanley left the tour to concentrate on a job as a sales representative with a 
beachwear company. But she's back this season, with a new attitude and a new 
partner, Linda Chisholm-Carrillo of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing full-time on the tour is one of the best ways to stay in shape," 
Hanley said. "There's more and more money on the tour now too. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of switching around with partners earlier this year and I 
ended up with (Chisholm-Carrillo). And if that's not enough to get fired up 
about . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Hanley and Chisholm-Carrillo, seeded sixth, lost in the second round Friday, 
but worked their way through the losers' bracket of the double-elimination 
tournament Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
They defeated fourth-seeded Gail Castro of Carlsbad and Lori Kotas of Cardiff, 
15-10, to advance to the losers' bracket semifinal Sunday against 
seventh-seeded Rita Crockett-Royster of Costa Mesa and Dennie Knoop of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Jackie Silva of Redondo Beach and Karolyn Kirby of San Diego will 
play third-seeded Janice Opalinski of San Juan Capistrano and Lisa Strand of 
Pacific Palisades in the winners' bracket final at 10 a.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's competition, top-seeded Shawn Davis of Los Angeles and Mike 
Whitmarsh of San Diego defeated fifth-seeded Andy Fishburn of Los Angeles and 
Dane Selznick of Santa Monica, 15-9, to advance to the winners' bracket final 
at 8 a.m. today. 
</P>

They will play third-seeded Pete Aronchick of Culver City and Mike Boehle of 
Santa Monica, who rallied from an 11-7 deficit to beat second-seeded Bob Chavez 
of Los Angeles and Steve Rottman of Santa Monica, 15-12, in the other 
semifinal.

The Laguna Open was a homecoming for Hanley, who led Laguna Beach High School 
to the Southern Section title in 1976, its only girls' volleyball championship. 
"This is one of the toughest spots for me to play," said Hanley, a three-time 
All-America at UCLA. "I'm distracted because I see a lot of old friends and I'm 
talking with them and not thinking about the matches." 
</P>
<P>
She said her thoughts also wandered to the Manhattan Beach Open, where her 
husband, John, was playing this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Distractions have been few for Hanley and Chisholm-Carrillo this season. 
Partners only for the last month, they won their first tournament together last 
week, defeating Silva and Opalinski in the finals of the Fresno Open. 
</P>
<P>
"That tournament just validated our feelings that we had great chemistry," 
Hanley said. "It was only our third week together and we're starting to play 
well. 
</P>
<P>
"We keep each other relaxed out there. Linda's a great blocker and I'm working 
on my defense to try and back her up." 
</P>

Pete Aronchick is closing on a possible second-consecutive Laguna Open 
championship. He and Mark Eller won the tournament last year. The last men to 
win consecutive titles were Sinjin Smith and Randy Stoklos (1984-86) . . . The 
women's championship final is scheduled for 2 p.m. today and the men's final 
will follow. . . . The winning men's and women's teams will each split $6,300 . 
. . The final for the four-player, co-ed tournament is scheduled for 1 p.m. 
today.

FOR THOSE OF US who don't have enough aggravation in our lives, Laguna Mountain 
Toys showcases manipulative puzzle packs (the Teaser, the Mind Bender) and 
original puzzles (the Temptation, the Creature). Handmade configurations of 
wood, rope, rings and beads, the inventions promise hours of fussing and 
twisting. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Kucera, a high school math teacher, began making and selling these puzzles 
at the local Sawdust Festival (now going on) to encourage "mental aerobics." 
Several years later, her husband, Don, joined her in business. One favorite, 
the party-pleaser People Puzzle ($8), consists of nothing more than nylon cord 
and wooden beads that intertwine and attach to the wrists of two people. The 
object is to separate the two cords without removing it from the wrists, and 
the result is instant entertainment for onlookers as well as participants. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Mountain Toys' puzzles stock is ever-evolving; some are phased out, 
while others are added. The most popular are the simpler brain twisters ($5 to 
$10), which take up to four moves to complete and come with solutions. Puzzle 
aficionados are more likely to go for the advanced models ("the more artsy, 
more heirloom-like pieces," says Don), which may require as many as 500 moves 
and come without even the slightest clue (for as much as $35). Laguna Mountain 
Toys also sells a few games and toys, and instead of the standard rocking 
horse, the Kuceras create giraffes, elephants and dinosaurs.

DELICATE WAVES of dots, diamonds, leaves, flowers and abstract designs weave 
their way around a Lydia Pollard bracelet. A face peers out from behind a 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
One color flows into another. At first, the work is puzzling. Is it made of 
fabric? Is it hand-painted? Plastic? Actually, Pollard's wearable collages are 
made of dozens of tiny bits of paper, adhered to a wooden bangle. 
</P>
<P>
"I love paper," says Pollard, who collects basketfuls of wrapping paper, 
magazine illustrations, calendars and catalogues. She painstakingly tears these 
papers and her own hand-dyed papers into strips, mixing and matching the 
pieces. The bangles are finished with a matte lacquer that adds to the subtle, 
Oriental quality of the work. Barrettes, earrings and pins are constructed a 
bit differently. Pollard approaches these more like miniatures, often using 
faces as the center of a composition with other related forms or items 
surrounding it. (Prices for the various items range from about $22 to $32.) 
</P>
<P>
Although she keeps busy supplying a number of museum shops around the country 
-- including the Smithsonian Institution -- Pollard does accept commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Lydia Pollard can be reached at LSP Designs, (213) 472-6077. Her pieces can be 
found at the Craft &amp; Folk Art Museum, May Company, 4th floor, 6067 Wilshire 
Blvd., Los Angeles, (213) 937-5544; Freehand Gallery, 8413 W. 3rd St., Los 
Angeles, (213) 655-2607; Art Options, 2507 Main St., Santa Monica, (213)

A DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE DIRECTOR; 
</P>
<P>
DEBORAH LAVINE'S 'OBSESSION' WITH THE HOLOCAUST IS WHAT ATTRACTED HER TO THE 
OBIE-WINNING DRAMA, 'A SHAYNA MAIDEL' 
</P>

<P>
On her honeymoon, Deborah LaVine made a point to stop at Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any family who are survivors, but I have such an obsession with 
the Holocaust," said the director. "I guess because it's such a clear evil -- 
and my people's history. I've always identified with the feeling of loss, the 6 
million. And it was such a dramatic time: the world being catapulted into this 
turmoil, otherwise civilized people sent to the edge of prejudice. It's just so 
. . . theatrical." 
</P>
<P>
So it's no wonder that LaVine jumped at the chance to direct the West Coast 
premiere of Barbara Lebow's Obie-winning drama, "A Shayna Maidel" (which opened 
this weekend at the Tiffany Theatre in West Hollywood), the story of a Polish 
family's reunion in the shadow of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes place in 1946," she said. "The father and youngest daughter have been 
in New York for the last 16 years. Originally, the mother stayed behind because 
the older daughter had scarlet fever. Then war broke out; the borders were 
locked. At one time, the father had the option to bring them over; someone 
offered him money for it, but he refused out of pride. The mother died in the 
camps; the daughter came through them and is a survivor. Now the father's 
bringing her to New York." 
</P>
<P>
"It touched me, as a mother, daughter and sister," said co-producer Sheryl 
Levine Guterman, who saw the production last year in New York. Guterman, whose 
Manna Company presented the story of Israeli martyr "Hannah Senesh" locally at 
the Zephyr in '87, feels the material "plays on many different levels," both 
Holocaust-specific and universal. Within that painful framework, both she and 
LaVine emphasize that the piece is not a downer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very cathartic, very hopeful," said LaVine, 38. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there are difficult moments. But it's also very positive, very uplifting. 
I've done plays that were about the Holocaust," LaVine said. In 1978 at North 
Hollywood's Theatre Exchange she staged Bertolt Brecht's "The Resistable Rise 
of Arturo Ui," based on Hitler's ascent to power. "This is not about that. It's 
about recovery and family, about survival and the will to live: two sisters who 
find each other and grow together, and a father who learns to open up to his 
daughters." 
</P>
<P>
Mind you, it's not just any play that would get LaVine, the mother of a 
7-month-old baby, into the director's seat these days. "I was not going to work 
in June," she said. "My husband's taking the bar in July, and I'd been working 
almost nonstop since the baby -- and before the baby. But when this play became 
available, I couldn't not do it. It wasn't even a choice. I know that sounds 
gushy, but it's true. That's how much this play means to me." 
</P>
<P>
In spite of the painful maternal separations (when her son was an infant, 
LaVine often brought him to rehearsals, cuddling him on breaks; "but now he 
needs to play, he needs his space; he needs to yell and scream"), the director 
clearly prefers working to sitting on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
"In a business like this, even though I consider myself blessed -- I work a 
lot, I get great choices -- I'm really nervous that if I break a link in the 
chain, nobody will put it back," she said. Actually, LaVine may have little to 
worry about: a veteran of more than 90 regional productions (including, 
locally, "The Jail Diary of Albie Sachs" at the Odyssey and the recent "Night 
Owls" at the Cast), she heads the play development series at Long Beach's 
International City Theatre and teaches acting at Long Beach City College. 
</P>
<P>
LaVine, a Cleveland native, started out as an actress (income supplements then 
included selling sandwiches door-to-door and packaging jockstraps at 
Frederick's of Hollywood) and got an early break as a regular on TV's "General 
Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
"It was during the days of Luke and Laura," she said with an apologetic 
grimace. "Laura had three friends. I was the white, middle-class one. Her name 
was Betty. Totally inconsequential and unnecessary." Worst of all, she said, "I 
didn't like doing it. And the truth is, I wasn't a very good actress. I like to 
do things well; I got no satisfaction knowing I wasn't very good. I didn't 
enjoy the business side, I don't like all the Hollywood-schmollywood stuff." 
</P>
<P>
A late '70s foray into directing quickly put her on the right course. "I kind 
of grew into it; it was a natural progression," she said. "And I've been very 
lucky, you know: All my life I knew I wanted to be in this world. I love what I 
do. I get paid for it. I get scripts that make me tingle. But sure, it's a 
tough career. It's not something where I can pick and choose, sit back and wait 
for the phone to ring with a good job." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe due to that, the workaholic spirit rarely flags. "Recently, there was a 
theater project I said no to," she said. "So I'm learning. I'm getting better." 
</P>

A BREATH OF FRESH PRINCE; 
</P>
<P>
WHY NBC HAS HIGH HOPES ON A RAPPER FROM PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Daniel Cerone, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Will Smith, a 21-year-old rapper known as the Fresh Prince, just got a job with 
NBC. His job expectations, as implied by his boss, NBC Entertainment President 
Brandon Tartikoff, are threefold: 
</P>
<P>
* To bring the black street world of hip-hop to American TV audiences. 
</P>
<P>
* To star in a sitcom bearing his name that will be the network's first 
"hit-the-ground running hit" since "The Golden Girls" five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
* To be a "big, breakout star" along the lines of, oh, say Eddie Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
"Brandon Tartikoff is making me nervous, comparing me to Eddie Murphy and stuff 
like that," Smith said after Tartikoff made the comments. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, hey, slow down a little bit." He chuckled. "Let me practice first. This 
has all happened so fast my head's spinning a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Smith sounded exhausted, speaking on a telephone from a hotel room in 
Washington, D.C., where he was meeting affiliates to promote his new fall show, 
"The Fresh Prince of Bel Air." 
</P>
<P>
The sitcom is backed by first-time TV producer Quincy Jones. It's about a funky 
byproduct of Philadelphia's gang-infested streets who is sent out West to live 
with his wealthy upper-crust cousins, whose plush lifestyle has buried their 
black roots. 
</P>
<P>
Smith quickly points out that the sitcom is not about rapping. It took me a 
while to make NBC understand-and they understand now- they don't want rap. They 
think they want rap performers, but no. What they want is a hip show. 
</P>
<P>
"Rap music-which a lot of white America doesn't understand-rap music is not 
just a music. Rap music is a subculture: hip-hop. It's a style of dress, an 
attitude, a look, a language. It's more than just music. 
</P>
<P>
For a middle-class kid from Philadelphia who never acted before, Smith is being 
asked to shoulder a load that might wobble the knees of Murphy himself. He's 
network televisson's first embodiment of a fresh generation. He's a prime-time 
tap into the urban street market, which is pumping rap music, loud new fashions 
and an Afrocentric political consciousness into mainstream society faster than 
the booming bass tracks of a def jam. 
</P>
<P>
Warren Littlefield, Tartikoff's right-man hand at NBC, said the network had 
been searching for a way to catch the wild rap tiger by the tail for some time. 
</P>
<P>
"We were all looking at Newsweek and Time and seeing these cover stories (about 
rap music)," he explained. "I was personally watching 'Yo! MTV Raps' and just 
feeling waves of something new and contemporary running through various streams 
of culture in America. We felt there was a drum beat going on out there, and we 
looked at our development (schedule) and said, 'It's not represented.' " 
</P>
<P>
Smith, one-half of D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince, endeared himself to 
kids everywhere in 1988 with the sympathetic rap hit "Parents Just Don't 
Understand," about a shopping trip he takes with his mother for back-to-school 
clothes. Although the duo's record sales have slipped since then, the 
bubble-gum rappers are still hopping. Their 900-number hotline, which will be 
used to promote an upcoming album, has set a music industry precedent by 
grossing a reported $10 million since its debut two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Will's a star," said Jones, a celebrated music producer/composer with 
19 Grammys to his credit. "He really makes it pop. He's got this magical sense 
of timing that's unbelievable. Right now he's not even thinking about it; he's 
just doing his own thing. He's going to be dangerous when he finds out where 
the cameras are." 
</P>
<P>
The real-life inspiration for "Fresh Prince" came from co-producer Benny 
Medina. "It was partially based upon the way I was brought up, a juxtaposition 
I was thrown into at an early age," Medina said. "I came from a broken home in 
Watts, and I was in and out of juvenile detention facilities and foster homes." 
</P>
<P>
Medina was living at St. Elmo Village, a Los Angeles community home center, 
when Jack Elliot, a white TV film composer living in Beverly Hills with a wife 
and three kids, decided to give Medina a chance. "They let me move in with 
them," he said. "I fixed up their garage in the back of the house and became 
part of the family. The deal was I had to keep a job, keep the grades up and be 
respectful of household rules." 
</P>
<P>
Medina wound up at Beverly Hills High School with the children of Motown 
kingpin Barry Gordy and eventually started working for Gordy as a junior 
executive at Motown. Today, Medina is head of black music at Warner Bros. When 
he and partner Jeff Pollack recently began developing TV projects, including an 
animated series that may go to Fox called "Hip-Hop Junior High," Medina 
instantly thought back to his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"One problem I found growing up in a ghetto (is) you have a very limited 
perspective of what you think the world is. Moving from one extreme to the 
other gave me a real clear picture of how people get held back on the basis of 
their situation. 
</P>
<P>
"We adjusted the premise of the sitcom to fit Will. My upbringing didn't have 
much comedy in it. Most of the kids I grew up with, if they're still alive, 
they're in Watts right now. Four of the six cats I grew up with are dead. I'm 
30." 
</P>
<P>
Medina met Smith in December at "The Arsenio Hall Show," which was celebrating 
Jones' acclaimed comeback album "Back on the Block," when Smith asked Medina 
for directions to a Lakers game. Soon after, Pollack began hearing second-hand 
raves about Smith after the rapper's performance on Disney's 35th anniversary 
TV special for NBC. Director John Landis cast Smith in the special based on his 
energetic performance in the music video for "Parents Just Don't Understand." 
</P>
<P>
"Disney wanted to do a musical number," Landis said, Rand they gave me a list 
of the same old boring names and said, 'Choose one.' I said, 'Gee, the Disney 
song catalogue is so marvelous, let's get somebody fresh.' I suggested Fresh 
Prince and D.J. Jazzy Jeff, and Disney basically said, 'Who? What?' 
</P>
<P>
"But you should have heard them. They rapped 'Supercalifragilistic.' " Landis 
broke into a brief rap-'Let's take an umdiddly break...' -and started laughing. 
"I was raving about them." 
</P>
<P>
Medina and Pollack contacted Smith, who joined the project immediately. "It was 
real," Smith said. "That's what everyone's missing on TV. You've probably seen 
that Tide commercial where the kid stands up on the washing machine and starts 
rapping, 'Mom my clothes are dirty/Gotta get some Tide/Go get some.' America 
needs to see that there are intelligent, articulate black people, and what 
better place to see them than on television?" 
</P>
<P>
The producers took their idea to -uincy Jones, who they knew was in meetings 
with NBC to develop TV projects. "I'm not a big fan of TV at all," said Jones, 
who is also working on a syndicated talk show with Jesse Jackson. "But blacks 
have been repressed on TV for so long. When I was young, there was nothing on 
the radio for blacks. It was like black people didn't exist. 
</P>
<P>
"Now there's such a vibrant new culture, in all its different hues, that has 
never been dealt with before. Everyone always thought of blacks in a 
sharecropper situation. A white person isolated in Iowa sees blacks on the TV 
set and thinks that's what black people are like, and they're always wrong. I 
want to change that."

"Quincy understands rap music," Smith said. "You know, he was pretty much there 
for the past 30 years of music. His input is valuable, because he understands, 
where someone else, you know, his age, wouldn't. Whereas I can't communicate 
what I'm trying to say to an executive, or someone I can't explain what hip is 
to- they think hip is rap music-Quincy can. He's a good mediator." 
</P>
<P>
"Fresh Prince" was in line with NBC's fall goal of more youth-oriented 
programming. But by this time it was mid-March-late to get a new fall show 
going-and there was no script, no cast and no Fresh Prince. Their future star 
was in Indiana on a concert tour. 
</P>
<P>
NBC wanted to see Smith "now" to find out if he could act. So Smith traveled 17 
hours straight by bus and plane to make it to Los Angeles. A screen test was 
arranged at Jones' home on his 57th birthday, the same night he received a 
lifetime achievement award from "Soul Train." 
</P>
<P>
"I went straight home from the show," Jones said. "It was about 10 p.m., and 20 
NBC cars were lined up at my house. They all wanted to see Fresh Prince." 
</P>
<P>
Smith emerged from an upstairs bedroom where he was studying a scene from an 
old sitcom pilot that was developed for singer Morris Day. NBC's Littlefield 
described the scene: "You gotta know, if you're a network programmer and it's 
late in the pilot season game and you're looking for a hit show, my heart 
starts to pound at this point. Will says, 'OK, so I'm just going to, like, read 
this scene, huh? Now, who are the guys from the network?' 
</P>
<P>
"Then he did a couple of little scenes from this failed sitcom script, and he 
just hit it. If he's a ball player, he hit a home run. We stood up, hugged him. 
I kissed Quincy and said, 'Thank you. Let's go to work.' " 
</P>
<P>
NBC brought in veteran writers Andy and Susan Borowitz to write the pilot (he 
was co-creator, executive producer and head writer of "Day by Day" and she was 
producer and writer for "Family Ties"). Smith was given the freedom to adapt 
his dialogue to suit his hip-hop lingo. Tartikoff even got in on the act, 
writing two jokes for the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
Littlefield said the pilot tested at record-breaking levels with kids and 
teens, better than "The Cosby Show" did. NBC ordered 12 episodes to premiere in 
September on Monday nights. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's rare in television or in film to find an actor and a character 
who leaps out at you," Littlefield said. "As broadcasters we've been saying to 
ourselves for years, "Where's the next Eddie Murphy?" What we found with Will 
is someone unique and distinctive unto himself. We took a contemporary musical 
artist and crafted a character who is a perfect fit. In no way is this an 
effort to put a rap show on the air. This is an effort to put Will Smith on the 
air. That's who we're banking on."

PLUMMER LAUNCHES A 'COUNTERSTRIKE' 
</P>

<BYLINE>

Sun.

"Doing a TV series is bad news, I think, for someone like me. You get so 
terribly identified with only one role you can't be taken seriously as an 
actor. I think when IUm old and gray and with my career behind me, maybe that's 
the time to do a series." 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Plummer laughed good-naturedly as those words, uttered years before 
he even considered doing something called "Counterstrike," were flung, 
unceremoniously, back at him. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I am getting gray, I suppose," said the actor best known for playing 
Capt. Von Trapp in "The Sound of Music." "I am 60, so I guess 60 is OK for 
this. But I don't know that my whole career is behind me just yet. There's 
still a bit more to do." 
</P>
<P>
However, Plummer, whose first TV series premieres Sunday at 10 p.m. on the USA 
Network, recalls making the statement and the reason for it. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone had asked me several years back if I would do a TV series. I 
remembered doing a play with old friend Raymond Massey in 1958 in New York. At 
the end, he went off to do Dr. Kildare and became a series actor. It was a big 
success for Pappy (Massey). But he was pushing 70 so it was OK. And that's 
where I got the idea from for that quote." 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that neither age nor a dwindling career-which is anything 
but-played heavily upon Plummer's decision to take up regular residence on the 
small box. It was the deal, plain and simple. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a wonderful deal. I work only 40 days a year. Forty days! I still have 
time to do a play or movies or whatever I want. With this kind of a situation I 
can't say IUm lumbered with a series. 
</P>
<P>
"The producers were very generous to me both financially and in time. 
Initially, I didn't want to do it. But they kept after me and kept bettering 
the deal. They wound up cutting it down in time for the same money, which is 
fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
But Plummer said there were other factors. "I didn't just do it for the money 
or the schedule. I liked the concept very much. I knew potentially it had some 
interesting possibilities. I'm a baby in the field of TV series, but I could 
tell this one was very promising.' 
</P>
<P>
"Counterstrike," produced by a Toronto compay, follows the exploits of an elite 
crime-fighting trio headed by a brilliant, eccentric billionaire (Plummer). His 
co-stars are Simon MacCorkindale ("Falcon Crest"), Cyrielle Claire ("Sword Of 
Gideon") and Stephen Shellen ("Casual Sex"). 
</P>
<P>
Plummer says he likes his character very much for its colors and the texture he 
may be able to bring to it. 
</P>
<P>
"He's an eccentric, sort of a rich tycoon who gives up his burning desire for 
money and power after his wife is kidnapped. He begins bringing terrorists and 
criminals to justice, often by taking the law into his own hands. During it 
all, he still wants desperately to find his wife, whom he believes is still 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a new story, of course. But I knew I could bring a different sort of 
creature to the screen than you usually see. I can give him a kind of 
overbearing authority that has a lot of energy to it. Also, his humor is 
cryptic and edgy, which could be fun." 
</P>
<P>
His co-stars will jet off to Paris to shoot additional sequences, but Plummer 
says he will remain behind. "This is convenient for me, but it's good they're 
going to Europe. Unlike most series, this one will have an international flavor 
to it." 
</P>
<P>
The script wasn't changed to accommodate him. The original story had his 
character as a man who was crippled in an accident and worked primarily out of 
his high-tech headquarters aboard a plane. 
</P>
<P>
"Since you only see him in his office or on a TV screen from the other end, it 
would have been foolish to send me all around the world." 
</P>
<P>
Plummer says he has no intentions of being idle while his cohorts are abroad. 
"I have several things I want to do, including a miniseries I'm co-producing 
("no details; bad luck') and there are several plays I want to do (one of which 
is a new London stage version of 'Moby Dick')." 
</P>
<P>
And he says he would like one day to do a project with his actress-daughter, 
Amanda Plummer (most recently Benny's girlfriend Alice on "L.A. Law"). "I was 
against acting with her when she was first becoming a hot star, after 'Agnes of 
God' (on Broadway). I thought it would be exploitive and awful at that time. 
But years have passed and I would love to do something with her now if we could 
find the right property." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Plummer, who has resisted being typecast as a Hollywood romantic 
lead by taking on a wide assortment of roles, says people always have been 
after him to do a series. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that I was against doing television, but I always felt a big hit 
series could hurt one's career. Think of someone like Telly Savalas, who had 
big talent but had a successful show. If he wanted to play Lear, he would still 
be seen as Kojak." 
</P>
<P>
Plummer, who has done much theater, says he had to be particularly careful. 
"You didn't want to get tied into something where it's bye-bye to the freedom 
you need for a varied career like mine. You want to go on challenging yourself 
in the kinds of roles television doesn't offer." 
</P>
<P>
The Toronto-born actor, who recently completed shooting a TNT movie, "Catherine 
The Young," in Leningrad, says his career plate is still fairly full and he'd 
like to keep it that way as long as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"There is tons of stuff I still want to do. You hope you do get them in before 
you're too old or you run out of energy and ambition." 
</P>
<P>
Then, smiling mischievously, he added: "And then, of course, you just do 
another television series."

<P>
AFTER 34 YEARS, ROBERT WARK, THE CURATOR OF THE HUNTINGTON'S ART COLLECTION, IS 
CALLING IT A CAREER, BUT YOU WOULDN'T CALL IT RETIREMENT 
</P>

Imagine "Masterpiece Theatre" getting the notion of doing one of its leisurely, 
humane series here in Lotusland. Somehow a city that only slows down for 
gummed-up freeways doesn't quite fit the bill. On the other hand, there are 
places hereabouts that do approximate the program's sense of the past existing 
in the present and chief among them is the Huntington Library and Art Gallery 
in San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
In this blessed Camelot anybody can bask in the illusion of being a character 
in "Brideshead Revisited" or a Henry James novel, strolling its rolling 200 
acres of barbered grounds, browsing its famous library or standing in agreeable 
awe before masterpieces of British art like the affectionate favorites "The 
Blue Boy" and "Pinkie." Actually you can't see the boy at the moment as he's 
off the wall for some minor touch-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Anybody can also wonder -- as pleasant as this all is -- if it is still 
culturally relevant in a city increasingly dominated by ethnic diversity and a 
cultural climate grown dubious of the hegemony of Anglo privilege. If anybody 
has the answer then it must be Robert Wark who has wandered the place and 
puttered its inner sanctums for decades as if it were his very own. He's just 
retired at 65 after 34 years as curator of the art collections and has 
witnessed every alteration visited on the Huntington by both history and 
changing times. He says the Huntington has not escaped the exigencies of the 
real world. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks the most dramatic change has been in education. The major symbol of 
this is the big James Irvine Foundation orientation building which opened in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first came here what we mainly did for the public was to open the doors 
at 1 o'clock and close them at 4:30. But we have become increasingly concerned 
with making our holdings interesting to the general public. We could do more. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is based on a theme of Anglo-American civilization in an area more 
and more dominated by ethnic minorities who are not part of that or necessarily 
sympathetic to it. The Anglo-American axis was once axiomatic as a cultural 
standard; today the assumption that Anglo culture is automatically blessed is 
no longer accepted. All the more reason to reach out and help people understand 
it as a historical phenomenon. We need to show today's real world that this 
civilization was capable of aspiring to serenity, stability and peace." 
</P>
<P>
He is troubled about the current controversy over the National Endowment for 
the Arts, calling it "a tragic business. If the government is to support the 
arts it should be without strings attached. But I'm more equivocal about it 
than some of my colleagues. Maybe expecting that degree of support from a 
government body is just too much to ask." 
</P>
<P>
Wark retired officially Saturday covered with honors including a lecture series 
created in his name, an acquisitions fund and a ceremonial publication in his 
honor with laudatory essays by colleagues stretching from London's Tate Gallery 
and Victoria and Albert Museum to the Yale's Paul Mellon Centre for British 
art. Former Huntington director James Thorpe said, "No one else has ever made 
such a profound and far-reaching contribution to the progress of art at the 
Huntington since the death of its founders." 
</P>
<P>
It all adds up to the scholarly sphere's equivalent of an Academy Award for 
lifetime achievement. Of course it's not exactly the same thing and thank 
goodness. Oscars are for obvious fame. Wark's encomiums are for quiet 
dedication, careful work and the slow advance of human knowledge. If they have 
any symbolic dimension, they honor the virtues of dignity, self-effacement and 
real accomplishment. In his time, Wark has organized some 100 scholarly 
exhibitions, written a dozen books and catalogues and literally doubled the 
size of the art collection, loading in everything from decorative arts to study 
collections for a total of some 6,000 objects added to the holdings. 
</P>
<P>
But on the eve of his retirement he had a black eye. 
</P>
<P>
Wark strolled the Shakespeare garden the other day talking about his tenure. He 
was wryly witty, vaguely rumpled and unself-consciously elegant as usual, but 
under his half-glasses there was a noticeable shiner. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a collision with a packing crate yesterday. There was something 
significant about it. It occured to me I hadn't had such a mishap since I first 
came here, ran into a crate and broke my toe. There is a certain symmetry in 
that as there was in connection with my first task of conservation, fixing some 
tiny spots on 'The Blue Boy.' At the time I was told it was a natural problem 
that would probably recur in about 30 years. Now it has and the painting is 
down again. A circle seems to have been closed." 
</P>
<P>
He points out that his retirement, while quite real, will not involve him in 
much more that moving about 500 yards from his office in the still-new Virginia 
Steele Scott wing for American art to another office in the library building 
where he will be a senior research associate. 
</P>
<P>
Wark came to the Huntington in 1956 with a joint appointment as curator and 
senior researcher. It was possible for him to pursue both tasks until the late 
'70s when a series of programs he politely calls "exhilarating" ate up more and 
more of his scholarly time, a minus factor in the idyllic column, an add to the 
harried real world quotient. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, the collection began to expand with a gift from the estate of Judge 
Lucius Peyton Green. It included a brace of French paintings that put the 
Huntington on the continental art map for the first time. Then came 50 American 
pictures from the Virginia Steele Scott foundation and a new pavilion to house 
them. At the moment, Wark is overseeing his final project -- the permanent 
installation of a dining room by the legendary Pasadena craftsman-style 
architects Greene and Greene, plus a gallery of pictures from their collection 
done in collaboration with Randell Makinson, director of the Gamble house. It 
is slated to open in September. 
</P>
<P>
In between, Wark was embroiled in what would certainly be the great crisis in a 
fiction-version of the Huntington -- the disastrous fire of 1985 which singed 
irreplaceable pictures and kept the gallery closed for a year. The 
ever-gentlemanly Wark termed it "a blessing in disguise" because it 
precipitated a long-awaited cleaning of the collection. Wark praised assistance 
lent by the J. Paul Getty Museum's conservation team who came immediately to 
the rescue. They wound up applying their advanced research on 
earthquake-proofing art installations. "The Getty tells us we two are the best 
prepared in case of a temblor," said Wark proudly. 
</P>
<P>
He has witnessed epochal change in Los Angeles' museum world. 
</P>
<P>
"The Norton Simon collections are certainly the most dramatic. He was ambitious 
from the word go. Everyone said it was impossible to form a major collection in 
these times and he simply proved us wrong. It's a staggering achievement for 
one man. 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways he and J. Paul Getty ran on parallel tracks. What Getty left 
forms an interesting contrast." 
</P>
<P>
He would not characterize the higgledy-piggledy confusion of bad Roman 
sculpture and kitschy salon painting that Getty collected personally other than 
to say that, "Well, he was known to be interested in bargains. 
</P>
<P>
"The future rests with that institution and they have splendid opportunities. 
It's an awesome responsibility to live in a fish bowl constantly scrutinized by 
the rest of the art world. I think they always try to act responsibly but it is 
true that witnessing that much power in the hands of a single institution is 
vaguely unsettling on the face of it." 
</P>
<P>
He mused on how the Getty initially established its various institutes, 
educational and conservation programs because they assumed they would never be 
able to spend all their vast income on works of art. Now, with 
multimillion-dollar prices for art becoming commonplace, Wark sees the 
possibility of even the mighty Getty one day being shut out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be the fate of all endowed institutions that operating expenses 
eventually catch up with income. In some ways the Huntington was the Getty of 
the 1920s. For a half-century it managed. I could buy things regularly for the 
first 10 years I was here. Sometimes I go and look at the prices on the old 
invoices when I want to cheer myself up. 
</P>
<P>
"But by 1970, income no longer met the operating budget and now we are heading 
into a major development campaign led by our new director Robert Skotheim. I 
hope the campaign can achieve its ends without changing what people admire in 
the Huntington. It's a very special place. Its basic mission as a specialized 
research center gives it a scholarly direction others can't afford to indulge. 
</P>
<P>
"Other institutions need blockbuster shows to keep people coming. Curators have 
no chance to do scholarship because they are too busy organizing special 
exhibitions. Our attendance stays steady at about a half-million a year. 
Curators ask me how we do it and I say we have a built-in blockbuster in the 
cactus garden alone. The total ambiance is more than the sum of its parts. It 
is a work of art in itself. You don't tinker lightly with the Huntington." 
</P>
<P>
Wark was born in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in 1924 when it was an attractive 
small city of 75,000. His father was a grain inspector and the family was more 
conscious of the ravages of the Depression than he realized at the time. 
Describing himself as a quiet child, he grew up loving music and still plays 
the piano, admitting that, "My personal artistic commitment leans more strongly 
to music than to art." 
</P>
<P>
He attended the University of Alberta which turned out to be a classic 
provincial British college where professors taught in academic robes. "No one 
thought art history needed to be taught. It was the sort of thing a gentleman 
picked up on his own. I studied English literature and history." 
</P>
<P>
He moved to Harvard for graduate study. At age 24, he had never seen a real art 
museum. One look a the university's fabled Fogg Museum and "I was bowled over. 
I knew instantly this was what I wanted to study." 
</P>
<P>
The art history department was at a peak moment, crammed with legendary faculty 
members like the renowned connoisseur Jakob Rosenberg. 
</P>
<P>
"I was greatly influenced by Wilhelm Koehler an expert in Carolingian 
miniatures. In those days, unlike now, the basic introductory course was taught 
by the most senior and eminent faculty member and Koehler taught that course. 
He could lecture for an hour on a single slide and told the teaching assistants 
that if they had more than three slides for a lecture it was an indication of 
being unprepared." 
</P>
<P>
The Ph.D program was rigorously formal and so tough that Wark's class halved in 
size each semester for two years. "Art history is not taught like that anywhere 
anymore. In fact, it's been so long it is probably time for it to come back." 
</P>
<P>
He mused on the state of present scholarship with its heavy emphasis on reading 
the social, political and economic significance of works of art. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course it's not my dish of tea but I've lived long enough to see various 
forms of art-historical investigation come and go. Each one, as they pass along 
leaves behind something permanent and important. The Marxist approach leaves an 
awareness of social context. I was brought up with the feeling that art was 
self-contained and evolved internally so I was missing a lot that art could 
tell me about society. But I think a formalist approach still comes closest to 
the basic appeal of art and I'm troubled by an approach that leaves out the 
issue of quality. If you want to look at art for its socio-economic 
significance, ordinary artifacts are more revealing. The decorative arts 
closely reflect social reality while the fine artist tends to transcend his 
times." 
</P>
<P>
Wark's Harvard mentors nagged him to give up his specialization in British art 
which was considered a minor genre, but he stuck to his convictions and the 
realization that if he wanted to work in this country, the Huntington was about 
his only option. When its then-director John Pomfret invited Wark to visit in 
1955, he took one look and said, "This is it." 
</P>
<P>
"I've never looked back despite some fairly handsome offers to move. I've had 
an incredibly happy career getting paid for doing what I most enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
He's a self-confessed workaholic who never married. He's close to a surviving 
sister whom he visits in summer at a cabin on Pigeon Lake near Edmonton. He 
walks and hikes for recreation, going regularly to a piece of land he owns at 
the foot of Mt. Palomar. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing on it but a magnificent oak tree and a stream. I plant things 
there. Sometimes I think I should have been a forest ranger." 
</P>
<P>
Now back to scholarship, Wark plans to concentrate on finishing cataloguing the 
Huntington's British drawings. 
</P>
<P>
"I've found 13,000 already and suspect there are two or three thousand more in 
books and folios in the library. As Kenneth Clark once said, I take more 
pleasure and satisfaction in adding one piece of factual knowledge than in all 
the interpretative writing in the world. Connoisseurship has a bad name now, 
but it does try to get the facts straight. When you find an accurate date for a 
drawing you add something concrete to history."
