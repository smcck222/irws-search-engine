INTO THE NIGHT: ALL EARS TRAINED ON 'REAL MEN . . . ' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN ALLMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: "Listening Party," Thursday night at the China Club. On the 
turntable was the new album "Real Men . . . Wear Black" by the three-man funk 
group Cameo, and several hundred people, including 66.6% of the band, showed up 
to lend an ear. 
</P>
<P>
The Entertainment: For those who have never been to one, a listening party for 
a rock album isn't quite like an evening at the symphony, with guests listening 
quietly and applauding between movements. In fact, it's not much different than 
a regular party, with guys scamming on girls (and vice versa). And other guests 
queuing at the bar for sophisticated adult refreshments while the record plays 
over and over. And over. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: Larry Blackmon and Tomi Jenkins of Cameo, along with celebrity 
guests Priscilla "Three's Company" Barnes and Sally "Oscar nominee for 'Anna' " 
Kirkland. Robert and Rosemarie Stack were among the later arrivals. 2 Live 
Crew's lead singer, Luther Campbell, was thought to be coming, but he 
apparently stayed home to wash his hair. Or his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Code: The title of the album dictated the dress code, though L.A.'s club 
hoppers hardly need a reason to drag out the black raiment. Some men wore sharp 
suits that would have looked right at home on Arsenio Hall, while women went 
for the time-tested, tight fashion model look. ("They looked like hookers," 
exclaimed one guest from New York, who was the only one in the room wearing a 
knee-length, floral-print dress.) 
</P>
<P>
Fashion Statements: Sally Kirkland wore one of her trademark tight dresses 
accented with pink and yellow flowers in her hair. One man wore shiny, 
skin-tight black vinyl pants that looked like hip huggers made out of hip 
waders. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: Asked if he was a big Cameo fan, Robert Stack replied, "I dig them. 
They're part of MTV, which is the motion pictures of today." Stack also 
revealed that he used to be a musician, to which his wife, Rosemarie, 
commented, "Now he just sings in the shower." 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: Video crews began to annoy on their 800th pass through the crowd. One 
man at the bar reached over, pretended to disconnect a few dangling wires from 
a camera positioned precisely three millimeters from his head, and said with a 
sneer, "Bon soir." 
</P>
<P>
Photo Op of the Night: What photographer or media crew could resist Robert and 
Rosemarie Stack cutting a rug on the dance floor.

DR. NEIL SOLOMON: ACNE AND WASHING UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NEIL SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: If a teen-ager has an acne condition, how important is it that the 
face be washed? I have known adolescents who were far from clean and who were 
never bothered with acne, and I have known others who appeared to be very clean 
who had a bad condition. How important is cleanliness in this? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: I recommend patients with acne wash two or three times day, using a 
mild soap and water; however, scrubbing the skin is not recommended. Acne is 
not caused by dirt. Scrubbing the skin will not improve the condition, and may 
even tend to aggravate it. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a medical question, write to Dr. Solomon, P.O. Box 36184, 
Baltimore, Md. 21285-6184. Solomon cannot give personal replies but will answer 
as many questions as possible in his column.

REPAP 1990 MEDIA GUIDE: A CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE MEDIA'S RECENT COVERAGE OF THE 
WORLD POLITICAL ECONOMY EDITED BY JUDE WANNISKI POLYCONOMICS/REPAP ENTERPRISES 
$19.95, PAPERBACK; 540 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MILES, TIMES BOOK EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "Repap Media Guide," now in its fifth edition, is not a guide to all the 
media. It deals overwhelmingly with print media. Only 10 of its 540 pages deal 
with broadcast media. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is Repap a guide to all the print media. It deals only with American print 
media. The Canadian press is covered in eight pages. The British Press per se 
is not covered at all, although the Financial Times and The Economist are 
included. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it a guide to all the American print media. Newspapers are covered much 
more heavily than magazines, and the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal 
and the Washington Post more heavily than other newspapers. On Repap's list of 
90 "Highest Rated Journalists of 1989," 45 come from those three newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it a guide even to all that those three newspapers do. The limitation 
concealed by its title is revealed by its subtitle: "A Critical Review of the 
Media's Recent Coverage of the World Political Economy." 
</P>
<P>
Have you won a Pulitzer Prize for drama criticism? Don't expect to find your 
name in Repap. The arts have no place here. Neither does cultural coverage in 
the broader sense. And neither, to name a more surprising omission in a guide 
with money and power on its mind, does science. The guide has something of the 
same labeling problem as one of Jude Wanniski's books does. Titled "The Way the 
World Works," that book turns out to be a primer in supply-side economics. 
</P>
<P>
For one-third of its length, Repap is an "Overview of the Print Media" with 
separate entries on individual newspapers and magazines. As a brief statement 
of the state of each publication, the guide is clear, concise and informative. 
Any working journalist who had received a job offer from one of the listed 
publications could read the relevant entry and show up for an interview 
basically in the know. 
</P>
<P>
For two-thirds of its length, however, Repap descends to personalities with a 
vengeance. It offers free-wheeling, tendentious capsule evaluations of the work 
of individual reporters and editors in the areas it cares most about; namely, 
"Commentators, Financial Reporters and Columnists, National Security/Diplomatic 
Correspondents and Social/Political Reporters." Like restaurants, journalists 
in these categories are awarded one, two, three or four stars. 
</P>
<P>
The markedly conservative slant of the editors means that reporters critical of 
the Bush Administration tend to be taxed as tendentious or -- a favorite tag -- 
"fashionable." Writing of Joseph Lelyveld, whom it names as the likely next 
editor of the New York Times, Repap opines: "Lelyveld's journalistic weakness, 
we suspect, is a personal commitment to 'human rights,' as he understands the 
term, in a way that may engage him emotionally." Distressing indeed. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters supportive of the Administration, by contrast, tend to be praised as 
objective and independent. Conservative journalists are, in general, watched a 
bit more closely than liberal ones are. Last year, observing that Michael Novak 
hadn't written much lately, Repap ventured to hope that he might pick up the 
pace a bit in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
The most outspoken liberal journalists, however, never go unnoticed. Alexander 
Cockburn of The Nation receives three stars and an entry in which he is coyly 
praised for "the street fighter's tendency to go for the most vulnerable spot 
of an opponent other than the jugular." Hit 'em high, hit 'em low, hit 'em 
where. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Not all entries are animated by the editors' conservative bias, but, in a way, 
most of the best entries are. The way to lose the Repap editors may not be to 
hold liberal views but, whatever your journalistic ability, to forgo 
immediately identifiable political plumage. Politics arouses Repap as nothing 
else. 
</P>
<P>
It was Mike Wallace, if I recall correctly, who remarked after years of 
interviewing that interesting people talk about three things: politics, sex and 
religion. Repap, omitting the latter two, is energetic but narrow in the way 
that people who care only about money and power often are. Still, no one in or 
near the print media will fail to find something of interest in this volume, 
and people who find Capitol Hill and Wall Street the only really interesting 
parts of the country may find it the last media guide they'll ever need. 
</P>
<P>
I do not suggest any increase in Repap's coverage of culture and the arts, 
since I doubt that the Polyconomics/Repap team could really do the job even if 
it tried. I do suggest, however, that even on its own terms, the guide could do 
a better job with science and technology. 
</P>
<P>
It claims that the major stories of 1989 were "Communism's Crackup and 
Crackdown," "Drugs and Crime" and "Planet of the Year," meaning 
environmentalism and, in particular, the Greenhouse Effect, on which, "taken as 
a whole, the news media did its worst work this year." But if a science story 
can be judged one of the three stories of the year, why do science journalists 
not rate a category of their own in Repap? 
</P>
<P>
The world political economy of Repap's subtitle will change profoundly if the 
environment, the carrier of life, becomes the bringer of death. Next year, will 
Repap mock Earth Day as the non-story of the year, and will it again ignore 
science journalists as a group? One fears it will, but given the fact that this 
guide has, for the moment, no serious competition, one can only hope it won't.

'DEAR YELENA': SOVIET MENACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The most important fact to remember about Ludmila Rasumovskaya's "Dear Yelena 
Sergievna" is that it was written in 1980, when Brezhnev was in power and 
Afghanistan was becoming the Soviet Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
This is crucial information. Bear it in mind while watching Moscow's Theatre on 
Spartacus Square production of this Soviet play during its all-too-brief 
sojourn at Cal State Dominguez Hills. The context single-handedly lifts the 
events from the realm of social to political speculation. Or, rather, it 
combines the two. 
</P>
<P>
It also explains why this play was banned in the U.S.S.R. for nearly 10 years. 
The piece -- which is performed in Russian, assisted by a clear synopsis and 
low-key (sometimes too low-key), simultaneous translation conveyed over 
earphones -- is about an impromptu birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
Four students arrive one evening at the apartment of their math teacher, Yelena 
Sergievna (Oksana Moysina). They bring champagne, a cake and a gift of 
expensive wineglasses. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine her surprise. 
</P>
<P>
These are warm, energetic, enthusiastic young people. They sing songs, play 
music, dance and draw the teacher into their merriment, making her feel valued 
and important. 
</P>
<P>
But while Sergievna is in the kitchen for a moment, we begin to discover that 
things might not be quite what they seem. The student Vitya (Sergei Pinegin) 
reveals that he stole the wineglasses from his parents' home. And there's a 
still more troubling hidden agenda for the visit. Vitya and his companions -- 
including Lilya (Irina Manulova), her fiance, Pasha (Viktor Mosienko) and the 
blond, enigmatic Volodya (Oleg Horitonov) -- are really there to get the key to 
a safe that holds the results of their math tests. 
</P>
<P>
A case of prankishness? Guess again. The students turn out to be a selfish, 
privileged bunch who need the grades to get into university (and avoid 
Afghanistan?). They'll stop at nothing to persuade Sergievna to hand them the 
fateful key. When the teacher demurs, the evening degenerates first into 
drunken debauchery, later into full-blown hooliganism. The more she resists and 
they fail, the more they perversely redirect the by-now senseless violence upon 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
It is a gripping, exhausting, at times breathtaking piece, written in five 
arias: Sergievna's eloquent speech of resistance and morality, pitting her own 
idealism in the front lines of World War II against the students' self-serving 
vandalism -- and the arias of each of the four students, who reveal themselves 
chillingly more like fascist than communist youth. 
</P>
<P>
Volodya emerges as the demonic leader of the pack, who, in his mounting 
frustration, eventually gives in to that bankrupt masculine last resort: rape. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartacus production of "Dear Yelena" is not for the squeamish. Nor is it 
the first since the ban on the play was lifted. In May 1989, Atlanta's Alliance 
Theatre imported a well-acted but much tamer theatre verite version of this 
play, produced by Moscow's Mossoviet Theatre. The Spartacus actors, with 
director Svetlana Vragova and designer Nikita Tkachuk, are into a far more 
stylized theater of menace. 
</P>
<P>
Pinteresque might have been the word for this production, except that it is 
excessively verbal, even strident at points in the second act, and that the 
make-up and action become more and more ritualized as events get more and more 
out of hand. The rancor and bile bring it closer to Albee in "Who's Afraid of 
Virginia Woolf?" 
</P>
<P>
There are items that remain open to question. Is it logical that at the height 
of the violence, Sergievna, who has staunchly resisted all along, would 
suddenly give the arrogant Volodya the key? It is a curiously unmotivated 
gesture -- a Pyrrhic victory as well, since by then the game has been lost by 
pretty much everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Rasumovskaya's rationale for these developments is murky at best, as if the 
frenzied symbolism has by then run away with the play -- it stops more than it 
ends. But a lot up to then is intoxicating stuff, and director Vragova's 
sizzling production at the hands of this vigorous four-year-old company packs 
one heckuva wallop. 
</P>
<P>
"Dear Yelena Sergievna" is being presented at the University Theatre on campus 
by the spunky Pacific Theatre Ensemble, Cal State Dominguez Hills and the city 
of Carson. On its own, as part of a cultural exchange, the ensemble hopes to 
send "Aliens," Steven Morris' new contemporary adaptation of Pushkin's "Eugene 
Onegin," to Moscow. (A reading of "Aliens" will be held on campus Saturday and 
Sunday to help raise funds for the trip; for information, call 213-516-3588.) 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, and with no lack of gratitude for what we got, the only 
regrettable aspect of all this is the brevity of "Dear Yelena Sergievna's " 
run. It is being performed only three more times but deserves a much longer 
run, preferably in a more centrally located venue. Theater anyone . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
At Cal State Dominguez Hills, Victoria and Tamcliff in Carson. Friday and 
Saturday, 8 p.m., with a final performance Sunday, 7 p.m. $12.50-$17.50; (213)

DOWNTOWN L.A. AREA FACES ROUND OF MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a three-week reprieve from malathion applications over Los Angeles 
County, state officials announced Monday that downtown Los Angeles and numerous 
surrounding neighborhoods must be sprayed for Mediterranean fruit flies. 
</P>
<P>
A 14-square-mile sector will be visited weekly by malathion-bearing helicopters 
for at least three weeks, beginning Thursday night, the officials said. The 
decision to spray followed the trapping last week of a lone Medfly in a 
back-yard peach tree near Echo Park, just west of downtown -- and less than a 
mile from where an infestation that eventually spread throughout the region was 
first detected last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The treatment zone is bounded roughly by the Golden State Freeway and Hyperion 
Avenue on the north, Vermont Avenue on the west, Olympic Boulevard on the South 
and the Los Angeles River on the east. In addition to Echo Park, it encompasses 
Silver Lake, Chinatown, parts of Koreatown and downtown's Bunker Hill and Skid 
Row. Many of these neighborhoods had not been sprayed before. 
</P>
<P>
Plans have been laid to bus homeless people to indoor shelters for the night. 
The Dodgers also are scheduled to play a home game Thursday night at their 
stadium within the treatment zone, but the spraying is expected to begin well 
after the contest is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The development marked a discouraging turn for the Medfly eradicators, who had 
been buoyed by a two-month hiatus in new discoveries of the crop-destroying 
pest. They had cut back the spray zone from more than 500 square miles at the 
infestation's height to just 34 square miles in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, every new fly is a disappointment," said Roy Cunningham, a U.S. 
Department of Agriculture entomologist and one of five scientists serving on 
the state's Medfly Science Advisory Panel. "I was hoping things were coming to 
an end." 
</P>
<P>
The pesticide applications will be followed by release of millions of 
sterilized fruit flies, which are intended to breed the fertile population out 
of existence over the span of three mating cycles. Should the sometimes 
troublesome supply of sterile flies run short, officials warned, it could 
necessitate several additional pesticide applications. 
</P>
<P>
In El Cajon, where malathion has been sprayed three times to eradicate an 
infestation of Mexican fruit flies, no new flies have been found since May 5, 
when two egg-bearing females were trapped, said Connie Smith, a spokeswoman for 
the California Department of Food and Agriculture. A mature male Mexfly was 
trapped near the same site April 25. 
</P>
<P>
Trapping was intensified before three aerial applications of malathion in June 
over 16 square miles of El Cajon, and trapping will be reintensified at the end 
of the summer, after the last batch of sterile Mexflies is released, Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
No wild Mediterranean fruit flies have been found in the San Diego area since 
one was trapped in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The crucial question now is whether the Medfly found in Echo Park is the first 
of a summer onslaught or an isolated find that represents the last remnants of 
the old infestation. 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said he believes that the long period between the new discovery and 
the last Medfly trapping on May 1 is an encouraging sign that the tide has 
turned against the pest. 
</P>
<P>
"By this time we should be finding lots of flies if we had made serious 
errors," Cunningham said. "It looks like we're doing the right thing because 
we're not finding oodles of flies." 
</P>
<P>
He noted that eradication officials had expected to trap a few flies in the 
summer months, when the hot weather and abundance of ripe fruit offers ideal 
breeding conditions for the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not unexpected," he said. "We all knew that we hadn't reached the point 
of celebrating yet. We really have to get through August for that." 
</P>
<P>
James R. Carey, a UC Davis entomologist who also serves on the Medfly Science 
Advisory Panel, has long warned that the summer could bring a resurgence of the 
Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
Carey has plotted the dates of all Medfly discoveries in California since 1975, 
when the first infestation in the state occurred, and found that the vast 
majority of Medflies were trapped in July, August and September. 
</P>
<P>
According to Carey's figures, only 9% of Medflies had been trapped from January 
to July over the last 15 years, while 69% were trapped in August, September and 
October. 
</P>
<P>
It is Carey's belief, based on his statistical research, that the Medfly has 
never been fully eradicated from the state, but that a porous system of 
trapping makes it seem as though the pest has vanished. 
</P>
<P>
The Medfly -- which lays its eggs in a variety of fruits and vegetables -- is 
considered a major threat to the state's $17-billion farm industry. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the aerial pesticide applications were upset by Monday's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Adelaide Nimitz, president of the community group Families Opposed to Chemical 
Urban Spraying, said the discovery of a Medfly so near a previous treatment 
zone reinforced her belief that the eradication campaign is failing. 
</P>
<P>
"No, it's not over yet," Nimitz said. "It's exactly what we knew would happen." 
</P>
<P>
Joel Reynolds, senior staff attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, 
an environmental group, said the new spraying may cause serious problems 
because it will encompass the large homeless population downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a huge area with one of the largest concentrations of homeless in the 
country," Reynolds said. "We are very concerned." 
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles announced plans late Monday to notify the homeless 
throughout downtown of the spraying and provide them temporary shelter. Sue 
Flores, director of human services for the city, said the city will pick up 
homeless people downtown and bus them to temporary shelters. 
</P>
<P>
The city has moved homeless residents before because of malathion spraying that 
touched fringes of downtown. She said only a few dozen of the estimated 1,000 
homeless in Skid Row took advantage of the service. 
</P>
<P>
Alice Callaghan, director of Las Familias del Pueblo, a community center in 
Skid Row, said the biggest problem would not be moving the homeless, but 
getting the word out to them that spraying will occur. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you find over 1,000 homeless adults?" she asked. "It's an absurd 
notion. They're spread everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Agricultural Commissioner E. Leon Spaugy, a co-director of 
the eradication project, expressed confidence that, despite the setback, the 
campaign, overall, is succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're still on course," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Spaugy said there should be few problems in handling the new outbreak, but he 
is concerned about two potential difficulties: locating an airport from which 
to launch the squadron of malathion-spraying helicopters, and securing a 
sufficient supply of sterile flies to phase out spraying in Echo Park after 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout most of the eradication campaign, the helicopters flew out of El 
Monte Airport and then Riverside Airport. Los Angeles County officials, 
however, complained that El Monte has carried too much of the burden and have 
opposed efforts to use the airport to stage flights to spray zones far from El 
Monte. The Los Angeles City Council also has been discussing a ban on using 
city airports for malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
Spaugy said the state intends to launch from Riverside Airport for the first 
spraying on July 5. After that, however, he is not sure which facility will be 
used. Under emergency powers given to the eradication campaign by the governor, 
the campaign technically can fly its helicopters from wherever it wants. 
Officials, however, have shown a sensitivity to the political nuances of the 
controversial program, especially in its latter stages. 
</P>
<P>
The eradication campaign has suffered occasionally from shortfalls in the 
number of sterile flies from breeding facilities in Hawaii. The shortfalls have 
been blamed on pesticide contamination in the food used to rear the sterile 
insects. 
</P>
<P>
The shortage, which at one point left the eradication project with a third less 
sterile flies than scientists had recommended, has resulted in a dilution of 
the treatment program -- a move that some of the state's scientific advisers 
have warned could open a "window of opportunity" for the pest to breed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MALATHION SPRAYING 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Food and Agriculture has announced plans to conduct 
aerial spraying of malathion in a 14-square-mile area including downtown Los 
Angeles and numerous surrounding neighborhoods. Three aerial applications of 
malathion will be made, followed by the release of sterile Medflies. If sterile 
Medflies are unavailable, additional malathion spraying will be conducted. The 
first spraying is scheduled for Thursday, to be conducted between 9 p.m. and 3 
a.m., weather permitting. 
</P>
<P>
Precautions: Stay indoors; keep animals indoors; wash animal dishes and toys 
left outside; cover cars; keep doors and windows closed. 
</P>
<P>
Information: Toll-free numbers for the Agricultural Commissioner: (800)

VENTURA WATER SAVINGS DOWN SLIGHTLY IN JUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Ventura has cut back water use by more than 25% since conservation 
became mandatory two months ago, official figures show. But those same 
statistics show that residents have slipped a bit with the arrival of hot 
summer days. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura posted a 26.1% reduction in water use in June contrasted with the same 
month last year. City residents consumed 1,621 acre-feet of water in June this 
year, down from 2,195 acre-feet in June last year, said Carol Green, a 
spokeswoman for the city Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
But Ventura residents saved less water in June than they had the month before, 
according to the statistics released Friday. City residents used 1,558 
acre-feet in May, contrasted with 2,144 acre-feet in May, 1989 -- a 27.4% 
reduction. 
</P>
<P>
One acre-foot of water equals 325,851.43 gallons, a typical yearly supply for a 
family of four. 
</P>
<P>
The four-year drought has created a water shortfall equivalent to roughly 
one-fourth of what the city normally consumes. For that reason, city officials 
have set a goal of reducing water consumption by 30% to more than compensate 
for the dry spell. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they were not concerned with the small increase in water 
consumption last month and that they were optimistic that Ventura would reach 
its goal of a 30% reduction sometime soon. 
</P>
<P>
"June is a hotter period and it is more difficult to save water," Green said, 
"But if you look at the overall picture, it is clear that we're headed in the 
right direction." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Richard Francis was equally pleased. "The people are responding," he 
said. "They realize we are in a serious crunch and they are willing to do their 
part." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura adopted a mandatory conservation ordinance in April after the drought 
depleted the city's aquifers and dried up the Ventura River. River water had 
been the main water source for the city's west end. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, which went into effect April 12, residents living in 
apartments, condominiums and mobile homes are limited to 196 gallons a day for 
each household. Single family homes are limited to 294 gallons a day. 
Businesses, farms and government offices must reduce consumption by 15% to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Large families, fruit-tree growers and other customers who can prove the water 
restrictions would cause them undue hardship are eligible for extra 
allocations. Green said that since the ordinance went into effect almost 2,500 
customers have requested extra water and the city has approved more than 2,300 
requests. 
</P>
<P>
Although mandatory conservation began April 12, city officials consider the 
first two months an "adjustment period." For that reason, the city had not been 
penalizing customers who exceeded their allotments. But since June 12, 
violators are being charged up to 10 times the normal water rate for excess 
use. 
</P>
<P>
The first bimonthly bills with penalties assessed for excess use will be mailed 
Aug. 12, Green said. To make its paper work more manageable, the city has 
divided its water customers into eight billing groups, with bills staggered 
over an eight-week period. The last group on the rotation will not be charged 
for excess use until Oct. 12, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
Francis said residents' civic awareness -- and not the threat of penalties -- 
was the driving force behind the city's conservation drive. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always a segment of the population that needs to be hit by the 
proverbial 4-by-4 to face up to reality, but I think most residents understand 
the need to conserve," he said.

COUNTY WINS TIME TO CUT JAIL POPULATION; 
</P>
<P>
COURT: JUDGE PRAISES COUNTY'S EFFORT TO CUT NUMBER OF INMATES AT CROWDED JAILS 
BUT SAYS IT MUST COME UP WITH A PLAN FOR EVEN MORE REDUCTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge Monday commended San Diego County for lowering the 
number of inmates jammed into the county's outlying jails but said the county 
will soon have to bring the count at the downtown jail lower still. 
</P>
<P>
El Cajon Superior Court Judge James Malkus, however, denied an ACLU request to 
order the county to immediately reduce the inmate total at the aging downtown 
jail, which another judge ruled 10 years ago was so crowded that living there 
was cruel and unusual punishment. Immediate cuts, Malkus said, are unworkable. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the judge, charged with monitoring the population at the county's 
jails under two lawsuits brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, 
including the one that resulted in the 1980 ruling, permitted jail officials to 
abide temporarily by a more generous inmate limit. But he also directed jail 
officials to report back Aug. 20 with a plan to cut the downtown inmate 
population -- somehow. 
</P>
<P>
Malkus's ruling was the most recent order issued by a line of judges presiding 
over the two major court cases, each filed to protest crowding at the jails. 
The county had been ordered to meet court-imposed population caps at the jails 
by Sunday, which it told Malkus Monday it had done at outlying facilities but 
not at the downtown jail. 
</P>
<P>
The county's lawyer at Monday's hearing indicated that it would be hard-pressed 
to come up with a new plan by the Aug. 20 hearing. The county, which depends 
largely on state funding, has not received enough cash to build new jails and 
has so little money that it is not even ready to staff a new jail now being 
built, said deputy county counsel Nathan C. Northup. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real bang your head against the wall kind of case," Northup said. "It's 
been that way from the start." 
</P>
<P>
It was evident, however, that Malkus' decision relieved county officials, who 
have been fighting the ACLU in court for 13 years over conditions at the county 
jails. "I think we dodged another bullet," said Sheriff's Cmdr. Mel Nichols, 
who directs the jails' daily operations. 
</P>
<P>
ACLU lawyers said they were pleased that the county had lowered totals at the 
outlying jails but disappointed that the situation at the downtown jail was 
left unresolved. "I quote Nelson Mandela: 'Keep the pressure on,' " said ACLU 
attorney Betty Wheeler, referring to the black nationalist leader from South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
According to recent surveys, the San Diego County jails consistently have 
ranked among the nation's most crowded. According to the ACLU's suits, the 
crowded conditions lead to violence and inhumane conditions at the jails. 
</P>
<P>
The first suit was filed in 1977. After a lengthy trial, San Diego Superior 
Court Judge James Focht ruled in 1980 that any count above 750 inmates at the 
downtown jail violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition against cruel and 
unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
The second suit was filed in 1987, again alleging crowding, this time at the 
five jails that the county had since built. Those jails include men's 
facilities in Vista, Descanso, Chula Vista and El Cajon, as well as a women's 
jail in Santee. 
</P>
<P>
Since the second suit was filed, the county has built another temporary men's 
jail in Santee. It is building another jail on East Mesa but has not allocated 
money to staff it upon its scheduled completion next spring. The ACLU suits do 
not include either of those facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The second suit came to an end in December, 1988, when San Diego Superior Court 
Judge Barbara T. Gamer approved a settlement calling for the county to meet 
certain caps by July 1, 1990. The settlement established caps of 937 inmates at 
the Vista jail, 440 at Descanso, 373 at Chula Vista, 251 at El Cajon and 478 at 
the women's jail in Santee. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ACLU agreed in May, 1988, to a temporary cap of 1,250 at the 
downtown jail while the facility in Vista was being emptied for renovation. At 
a hearing last month, with Vista again fully operational, Malkus ordered the 
downtown cap lowered to 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Though the county was a total of 230 inmates over the caps at last month's 
hearing, on June 11, Northup reported Monday that each of the outlying jails 
had complied with the limits by last Sunday's deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The county met the goals, Northup said, through a variety of methods, including 
the deportation last week of 63 illegal aliens convicted of crimes, the 
transfer of 30 inmates to probation department camps and the addition of bunks 
at the Vista and Descanso jails for the transfer of inmates from downtown. 
</P>
<P>
It also made use of a system that Malkus approved at last month's hearing that 
allows jail officials to exclude from the count inmates in medical beds and 
those awaiting release. Those categories amounted Monday to 113 inmates, jail 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied at this point that everything that had to be done has been done 
to bring the county into compliance," Malkus said. "I commend the county." 
</P>
<P>
ACLU attorneys, however, said they are bothered that the county met the caps 
only under the threat of fines or contempt-of-court citations, which Malkus 
issued this year. For instance, not counting inmates who, regardless of the 
circumstances, are in custody is a misleading "shell game," lawyer Alex Landon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
ACLU lawyer Wheeler said she was especially distressed at Malkus' refusal to 
order an immediate return from the current inmate cap of 1,000 at the downtown 
jail to 750. The downtown jail held 1,008 inmates Monday, only 836 of whom had 
to be officially counted, according to jail officials. 
</P>
<P>
Because conditions at the downtown jail remain cruel and unusual, "in essence 
the Constitution has been suspended for those people, with the approval of the 
court, and I find it very disappointing," Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
Malkus said he could not order immediate cuts at the downtown jail because that 
would "be unmanageable and would create a public safety concern." 
</P>
<P>
But he added that he also was "not about to undo" the lengthy 1980 trial at 
which the cap of 750 was set. He ordered Northup to prepare for the Aug. 21 
hearing "concrete proposals" detailing methods and a timetable for achieving 
cuts to 750 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer the county delays, the more exacerbated the situation becomes," 
Malkus said.

POLICE INVESTIGATING STUN-GUN INCIDENT; 
</P>
<P>
VENTURA: AN OFFICER'S USE OF THE 50,000-VOLT DEVICE ON AN EPILEPTIC DRIVER 
LEADS TO A CRIMINAL INQUIRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura Police Department, responding to witnesses' accounts of a traffic 
officer's use of a stun gun on an epileptic driver, announced Monday that it 
has begun a criminal investigation into the June 23 incident. 
</P>
<P>
The department, which already was conducting a review to see whether the 
officer acted within police policy, began its criminal probe Friday after 
witnesses confirmed newspaper reports of the incident, Lt. Pat Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney would not say specifically what witnesses told investigators or what 
laws the officer might have broken. However, state law requires that officers 
use only reasonable and necessary force when dealing with citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran motorcycle Officer Steven Mosconi acknowledged in a report last week 
that he jolted a 26-year-old Ventura man up to nine times with a stun gun after 
the man -- still groggy and disoriented from a seizure -- refused to get out of 
his truck. 
</P>
<P>
The officer said he was told when he arrived that the driver, Donn Christensen 
Jr., was still recovering from an epileptic seizure. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen and two witnesses have told The Times that Mosconi not only used 
his 50,000-volt Nova gun to force Christensen out of his truck but also shocked 
him at least twice after he was standing passively beside the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
One of the witnesses said Mosconi appeared berserk at the time. Another said 
the officer cursed and threatened him. A third said the officer called him a 
liar. 
</P>
<P>
"After verifying some of the reported accounts, it was decided that we needed 
to talk to all of the witnesses," Rooney said. "It's in our interest to 
maintain public confidence in our department. If there is the slightest 
possibility that there was a violation of criminal law, then we need to 
investigate it." 
</P>
<P>
Mosconi, a 14-year veteran of the Ventura force, remained on duty as a traffic 
patrolman on Monday, the lieutenant said. The officer could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
Rooney said that five investigators have been assigned to the Christensen case 
and that they had questioned more than a dozen witnesses by working through the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Although the investigation is focused on the conduct of Mosconi, investigators 
are also analyzing the actions of four other officers, Rooney said. The 
officers are Tammie MacInnes, Ronald Rojo, Dennis Ward and Cpl. Gary McCaskill, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
All five responded to two minor car accidents that occurred when Christensen 
swerved in front of oncoming traffic on Thompson Boulevard while having a 
seizure, Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
The other officers were preoccupied with the accidents while Mosconi dealt with 
Christensen, witnesses have said. Rooney said the inquiry will determine if the 
other officers had any role in the Christensen incident. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department's findings, expected in about two weeks, will be 
forwarded to the district attorney's office, county prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll get copies of all their reports," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. 
Kossoris, who interviewed Christensen last week. 
</P>
<P>
Kossoris is conducting a separate criminal inquiry into the death of 
psychiatric patient Duane Johnson, an Oxnard man with heart disease who died in 
February after Ventura police shocked him repeatedly with stun guns while he 
was tethered to a bed. The county coroner found the stun gun to be one of three 
primary causes of the death. 
</P>
<P>
Kossoris said he interviewed Christensen because the Ventura department's 
continued use of stun guns to gain compliance from crime suspects is relevant 
to the Johnson case. The prosecutor said he had noticed a similarity between 
the two cases. 
</P>
<P>
"In both cases, it appears the officer used the weapon a number of times over 
and above what he reported," Kossoris said. 
</P>
<P>
Kossoris said his interest in the Christensen incident had not reached the 
status of a criminal investigation by his office. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually we don't do an investigation on our own except in cases of death," he 
said. "Typically, the police would investigate, and if they thought there was a 
possibility that a crime was committed, then we would consider whether to go 
forward with it." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Kossoris nor Kevin McGee, acting chief deputy district attorney, could 
say Monday how many brutality cases involving Ventura police officers the 
district attorney has prosecuted in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Police Department policy allows officers to use stun guns -- which are 
considered a nonlethal alternative to nightsticks and firearms -- to control 
people who pose a threat to officers or the public. 
</P>
<P>
The weapons also can be used to force crime suspects to comply with officers' 
orders. The department found that officers had acted within policy in the 
Johnson death case.

GRAND JURY URGES LOOK AT TRUSTEES' OPERATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
RECOMMENDATIONS: A REPORT TO THE COUNTY SAYS A FIRM SHOULD BE HIRED TO EXAMINE 
HOW THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT BOARD IS BEING MANAGED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Grand Jury ended its yearlong investigation of county 
government Monday with a recommendation that the embattled County Community 
College District undergo a management audit. 
</P>
<P>
District Trustee James T. (Tom) Ely has been under investigation for three 
months by the district attorney's office because of allegations that he charged 
thousands of dollars of personal expenses to the district. 
</P>
<P>
Although the grand jury report does not mention Ely by name, it urges the 
county to hire an outside auditing firm to examine the way the Board of 
Trustees does business -- focusing on the board's Operations and Procedures 
Manual, which Ely wrote last year. The trustees voted Dec. 5 to put the manual 
into use. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury report said that recent developments involving the district 
Board of Trustees "might be interpreted as internal problems. Financial and 
management accountability is an absolute must to keep the respect of the 
students and community." 
</P>
<P>
Greg Kampf, chairman of the district board, and Trustee Greg Cole said that 
language refers to Ely's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ely said the report refers not to him, but to the disappearance of 
travel records and expense receipts that he turned in to the district. "The 
district office is in turmoil," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Cole said that some rules in the trustees' manual may be improper, including a 
rule that allows trustees to seek reimbursement for car expenses incurred while 
driving between their homes and board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
But Ely said such reimbursement "has been the practice and procedure and policy 
in the district and in every district in the state." 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, we're going to go over that procedures manual with a fine-tooth 
comb," Cole said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind the trustees being audited; that's absolutely no problem at all," 
Kampf said. "Most of our financial accounts have been audited. . . . The 
district attorney has done quite a bit of that already." 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury also recommended that the county: 
</P>
<P>
* Expand night court hours and locate municipal courts in cities around Ventura 
County to ease congestion in the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
* Establish a gang-control committee of police, school, probation and parole 
officials to curtail gang activities. 
</P>
<P>
* Install video cameras in police booking areas to provide information during 
trials about behavior of mentally ill defendants at the time of their arrest. 
</P>
<P>
* Make the county agricultural commissioner's office a full-blown agency 
instead of a one-man office to improve crop quality and consumer protection. 
</P>
<P>
* Allocate money generated by county sales taxes to each city based on its 
population instead of on the amount of money collected in its retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
* Assemble a task force to establish soil and ground-water pollution standards 
that would govern cleanup operations. 
</P>
<P>
The grand jury formally presented its 123-page report to Judge Edwin M. 
Osborne, presiding judge of the Ventura County Superior Court, who thanked the 
jurors and excused them from their task. 
</P>
<P>
County Clerk Richard Dean then picked the 1990-91 grand jury, choosing 19 names 
at random from 30 names locked in a barrel. Osborne appointed one of those 
chosen, Lyle Wray, a 49-year-old retired corporate executive who lives in 
Thousand Oaks, as grand jury foreman. 
</P>
<P>
The other grand jurors include 11 men and seven women, and range in age from a 
20-year-old Oxnard College student to a 79-year-old retired Teamsters Union 
business agent. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office already is preparing to send cases to the grand 
jury for indictment, which California voters decided to allow when they 
approved the Proposition 115 Crime Initiative bill June 5. The county may have 
to impanel a second grand jury just for criminal cases, said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Donald D. Coleman, special legal adviser to the grand jury. The Legislature 
would have to approve such a move first, as it did in Los Angeles County, 
Coleman said.

TRAFFIC RISE PROMPTS HIGHWAY USE STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Concerned about a sharp rise in traffic along California 126, the Fillmore City 
Council has authorized a $45,000 traffic study of the portion of the highway 
that passes through the city. 
</P>
<P>
According to a city staff report, traffic on the highway near A Street 
increased from an average of 17,000 daily trips in April, 1988, to about 25,000 
trips in May, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Roy Payne said Fillmore must differentiate between locally 
generated and "pass-through" traffic to better determine whether future 
development is a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
Payne said pollution caused by local traffic was considered to be within the 
limits set by state and county standards, but increased use of California 126 
would affect the overall picture. 
</P>
<P>
The study, which the city hopes to complete in four months, will serve as a 
necessary part of environmental analysis required by the city's proposed 
development of the North Fillmore Industrial Park. It will also speed decisions 
on future residential developments and on commercial uses proposed along the 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
Solutions for congestion problems along the highway could include improvements 
at intersections or increasing the number of signals on California 126 as it 
passes through the city, Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the city has no control over the amount of traffic originating outside 
the city limits, the study may indicate problems that cannot be mitigated, 
Payne said. Although this would not necessarily call a halt to growth in 
Fillmore, the city would have to address traffic and air quality issues, and 
"development could be affected," Payne said. JANET BERGAMO

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL PANEL BACKS SPECIAL FUND FOR 
REWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A City Council panel on Monday endorsed the establishment of a $10,000 fund 
from which police could offer rewards of up to $500 for information leading to 
the arrest of suspects in so-called "hate crimes." "This fund will enable us to 
conduct a form of psychological warfare to help stop these crimes of bigotry," 
Deputy Police Chief Ron Frankle said. 
</P>
<P>
Police have found an average of 300 hate crimes committed in the city each 
year, with about half of those taking place in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of this measure is deterrence, and the more it's publicized the 
more likely that these kinds of crimes will diminish," said Councilman Richard 
Alatorre, chairman of the Public Safety Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"The kind of person we're after is someone who commits the crime so he can talk 
about it," Alatorre said. "If he knows someone will report him, he will be less 
likely to commit it." 
</P>
<P>
Frankle said the fund would be just "one tool" in a wide-ranging program.

COW'S WANDERLUST NO SOMETIME THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A rancher has claimed a Black Angus that wandered into an Ojai pasture more 
than a week ago, but he'll have to wait till the cow comes home. 
</P>
<P>
The cow's owner, Art Balchen of Ojai, said Monday that the cow's name is Multa 
and she is 2 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Multa strayed from Balchen's Chuhuichupa Ranch and wandered along San Antonio 
Creek to the Lion Mountain Ranch, about 3 1/2 miles east. 
</P>
<P>
Carolie Jensen, who leases a pasture at Lion Mountain, looked after the cow and 
ran a "found" ad in a local newspaper all last week. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone, I don't know who, cut out the 'found' ad and left it on my kitchen 
table Friday," Balchen said. He said he proved his ownership of the cow and is 
trying to entice her onto a trailer with her favorite food, alfalfa cubes. The 
process will probably take a couple of days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Balchen said it's not the first time that Multa, which he described as a 
"squirrelly, impatient" beast, has strayed from home. 
</P>
<P>
"My son and I have watched her from the window before and we've seen her jump 
over our fences, even a six-foot chain-link one. It's hard to believe that such 
a big old cow can jump just like a deer." 
</P>
<P>
He said Multa, a breeding cow, has to get home soon because she has a date with 
a bull named Cadwaleder. MAJA RADEVICH

BILL TO REGULATE USE OF ELSMERE CANYON AS LANDFILL REVIVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Assembly Natural Resources Committee on Monday revived a watered-down 
version of a bill sought by the city of Santa Clarita to guarantee that the 
city and county of Los Angeles comply with a new state law regulating dump 
locations if they create the proposed Elsmere Canyon Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Under a compromise, the legislation by Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa Clarita) would 
take effect only if another more sweeping proposal -- which would apply to the 
location of all new dumps in the state -- fails to be signed into law. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, which last week rejected the Davis bill, approved the compromise 
version on an 8-1 vote and sent it to the Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
The lone dissenter was Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles), who 
represents parts of the San Fernando Valley. He described the bill as "special 
treatment" for Elsmere Canyon, which could increase pressure to place dumps in 
the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area, which he opposes. 
</P>
<P>
One legislative staff member, who asked not to be identified, said that linking 
the Davis bill with the fate of the statewide proposal, by Assemblyman Dominic 
L. Cortese (D-San Jose), is unusual. But, he said, "This is a special situation 
because concurrent with the Elsmere controversy is a controversy over siting of 
landfills throughout the state." 
</P>
<P>
Lobbyists for Santa Clarita described the compromise as a backstop for the city 
in case the Cortese proposal stalls in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
The city and county of Los Angeles are considering building a landfill in 
Elsmere Canyon next to Santa Clarita, sparking protests from local residents. 
It would hold millions of tons of waste, dumped over the next 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
At issue in the Legislature is what kind of environmental rules the state 
should apply to the location of new garbage dumps. 
</P>
<P>
Under a law that took effect this year, local governments have four years to 
develop a waste management plan spelling out how they will meet goals of the 
law, which is aimed at reducing the amount of trash allowed into dumps and at 
increasing recycling. In the meantime, Los Angeles County is prevented from 
approving the creation of landfills unless the state determines they are needed 
to ensure public health. 
</P>
<P>
But a dispute has arisen over when the state will apply the tough, new 
standards as it phases in the new law over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita officials said that either the Cortese bill, in its present form, 
or the Davis bill if the Cortese bill does not pass, would provide adequate 
safeguards by imposing immediate conditions on any Elsmere Canyon dump. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County officials have opposed the Davis proposal as unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
Davis denied that his bill merely restates existing law and dismissed 
suggestions that he is pushing it as a face-saving device. He said he would 
have fought for a tougher bill but Santa Clarita officials told him they 
believe there are adequate safeguards in the Cortese bill. 
</P>
<P>
"If my city is satisfied they are being protected, that's fine," Davis said. If 
the Cortese bill "turns out to be a turkey . . . we'll fight it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita City Councilwoman Jill Klajic said that Monday's action provides 
the city with a vehicle to argue its position in Sacramento. "If we need to 
come back, we have a bill we can work on," she said.

WEEKEND THEFTS OF AVOCADOS REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Avocado thieves struck three times during the weekend at Ventura County 
orchards, sheriff's officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The first theft was reported late Friday at the Teague McKevett Ranch east of 
Santa Paula, said Sgt. Chris Godfrey of the Ventura County Sheriff's 
Department. Four or five thieves entered the orchard through the Santa Paula 
Creek bed, stuffed about 200 pounds of the fruit into bags and fled on foot, 
Godfrey said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, about 600 pounds of avocados were stolen from the Broome Ranch 
near Point Mugu, said Sheriff's Cmdr. Merwyn Dowd, who heads the county's 
avocado task force. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies arrested Luis Juarez, 32, and Martin Ortega, 19, both of Oxnard, on 
suspicion of grand theft. Officers later found a load of avocados in a van that 
had been abandoned near Camarillo State Hospital, Dowd said. 
</P>
<P>
Late Sunday, thieves conducted another midnight raid on the Teague McKevett 
Ranch, stealing an undetermined amount of avocados. Sheriff's officials believe 
that the thieves again entered through the creek bed. 
</P>
<P>
Godfrey said the same thieves may be responsible for both thefts, as well as 
for earlier thefts this year. 
</P>
<P>
Avocados generate more thefts than any other fruit because of the high prices 
thieves can get for the Hass variety of avocado. Growers are getting about 
$1.45 a pound for Hass avocados, according to the California Avocado 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The rash of thefts has activated the county's avocado task force, a group made 
up of sheriff's deputies, avocado growers and shippers, and the district 
attorney's office, Dowd said. The task force has been watching orchards where 
avocados are about to be harvested. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the thefts are being reported in the Santa Clara Valley and in the 
Santa Rosa Valley near Camarillo, Dowd said. Thieves have hit farms around the 
county on 16 other occasions, usually on nocturnal raids. PSYCHE PASCUAL

Fireworks can scare animals. The Humane Society and animal control officers are 
especially busy around Independence Day because many pets run away. Some are 
injured.

Animal enthusiasts recommend keeping pets in a house or garage during this 
time. A radio or television can be left on to drown out the noise of fireworks. 
When pets are taken outdoors, they should be on a substantial leash and wear an 
identification tag. 
</P>
<P>
To locate a lost pet, contact the Department of Animal Regulation at 654-5000

COALITION MAY FORM TO EASE LOCKHEED LOSS; 
</P>
<P>
BURBANK: THE LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCIL NEXT WEEK WILL CONSIDER A PROPOSAL FOR 
SEVERAL GROUPS AND AGENCIES TO JOIN FORCES TO BLUNT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE 
AIRCRAFT FIRM'S DEPARTURE. 
</P>

<P>
Los Angeles City Councilman Robert Farrell on Monday proposed formation of a 
coalition of business groups, labor organizations and city agencies to soften 
the expected economic blow of Lockheed Corp.'s planned departure from Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
The coalition measure, expected to be presented to the City Council next week, 
would pull together local private industry councils, chambers of commerce, 
labor groups and the city's Community Development Department. It would focus on 
retraining former Lockheed workers and keeping alive smaller businesses that 
depended on the aerospace giant for business, Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the organizing device of the '90s for social justice, economic justice 
in this city," Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal came after a special meeting of the City Council's Community and 
Economic Development Committee in Sun Valley to consider ways of softening the 
impact of Lockheed's departure. Representatives from Lockheed, labor 
organizations and private business groups offered their perspectives on the 
move during the two-hour meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed announced May 8 that it was relocating much of its Burbank operation 
to newer facilities in Palmdale and Marietta, Ga., by the mid-1990s. 
Approximately 6,000 Lockheed workers are expected to lose their jobs -- either 
through layoffs or forced retirement -- by December, Lockheed spokesman Ross B. 
Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Burbank and business groups in the southeast Valley already have 
begun programs to ease the transition. But because the impact of the company's 
move is expected to be felt beyond the borders of Burbank, Farrell said a 
larger coalition is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are doing things, but no one has put it all together yet," 
Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
The Burbank City Council next week will consider an ordinance that would 
control development on the nearly 300 acres expected to be left vacant by 
Lockheed. But Hopkins said he feared that such an ordinance might have a 
devastating effect on the company's ability to sell the land. He said the key 
to economic recovery after Lockheed leaves is to return the land to productive 
use as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The Burbank Chamber of Commerce last week held a job fair for Lockheed 
employees, and the Verdugo Private Industry Council -- which includes Burbank, 
Glendale and Pasadena -- has been providing job training since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the land. We have the employees. We have the training," said Brian 
Bowman, a commissioner on the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority and a 
member of the Verdugo Private Industry Council. "What we really need is the 
appropriate environment to nurture the basics that are there." 
</P>
<P>
Don Nakamoto, spokesman for the International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace 
Workers AFL-CIO -- the union that represents many Lockheed workers -- said he 
was encouraged by Farrell's proposal. "I think it's critical for our people 
that this program gets off to a good start," he said.

ANIMAL-RIGHTS ACTIVISTS PROTEST AT SHELTER; 
</P>
<P>
DEMONSTRATION: AN EMPLOYEE OF THE WEST VALLEY FACILITY IS ACCUSED OF KILLING 
PROSPECTIVE PETS UNNECESSARILY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Carrying signs reading "Animal Slaughterhouse" and chanting "This Shelter 
Kills," 24 animal-rights activists rallied Monday outside the West Valley 
Animal Shelter in Chatsworth to protest what they called the unnecessary 
killing of dogs and other pets at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, many of whom belong to a local animal-rights group called 
Citizens to Save Our Pets, called on the city to fire a an employee of the 
shelter whom they dubbed "the executioner" and to investigate the deaths of 
animals at shelters throughout Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Animal Regulation General Manager Robert I. Rush, the official in 
charge of the city's six animal shelters, said that protesters' charges of 
unnecessary destruction of animals throughout the Los Angeles shelter system 
were unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
"If somebody's done something wrong, we'll drop the house on them," he said. 
"This is the best animal-control agency in the world. Period." 
</P>
<P>
Protesters charged that Dwayne Stinson, the shelter's animal-care technician 
supervisor, repeatedly authorized the destruction of animals before those 
interested in adopting them as pets had time to visit the shelter. Although 
protesters did not accuse Stinson of violating any law, they assailed him as 
lacking compassion toward animals and called for his immediate ouster. 
</P>
<P>
"The man is cruel and inhumane, and everybody who is in the movement knows Mr. 
Stinson," protest organizer Carol Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
Stinson declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
Among Stinson's harshest critics Monday was protester Jay Tell, a Canoga Park 
resident who charged that Stinson improperly permitted the killing of a stray 
dog Tell brought to the shelter in early May. 
</P>
<P>
Tell said he brought the dog to the facility because, three weeks after his 
daughter found the otherwise docile animal in their yard, the dog bit a 
neighbor while the man was mowing his lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Tell's wife sought the advice of animal-control authorities, who told them that 
by law they had to bring any stray dog to the shelter, Tell said. Tell left the 
dog at the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 10-day quarantine period mandated by city law for animals 
which have bitten people, he visited the dog and was told by shelter officials 
that his application for adoption was proceeding normally, Tell said.

<P>
Two days later, Tell received a telephone call from Stinson, who said he had 
mistakenly authorized the destruction of the dog and apologized for his action, 
Tell said. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Olsen, the Department of Animal Regulation official in charge of the West 
Valley shelter and Stinson's supervisor, said the department was investigating 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
He said the department acted legally in destroying the dog, because Tell had 
waited three weeks to bring the stray to the shelter and because the animal had 
bitten someone. But he said Stinson should have contacted Tell before he 
authorized the dog's death. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lack of communication, and something was done about it 
immediately," Olsen said. "We made sure that that will never happen again." 
</P>
<P>
He said shelter officials had not fired Stinson or forced him to change jobs, 
but he declined to comment on whether Stinson had been disciplined in any other 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators said they will continue to protest daily outside the West Valley 
shelter until the city fires Stinson.

A fire caused $400,000 in damage to three stores late Sunday night, but no one 
was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Three fire companies answered the 10 p.m. call at a small shopping mall in the 
3400 block of East Plaza Boulevard. It took about 30 minutes to bring the fire 
under control, said Nancy Ruland of the National City Fire Department.

PEOPLE: LISTEN, NOW, TO A STORYTELLER'S TALE OF WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT J. VIDA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ed R. Dobyns, 55, believes he was born to be a professional storyteller but 
took the long way around getting there. 
</P>
<P>
"I originally set out to be an engineer and became a good one," said the San 
Onofre Nuclear Generating Station worker who lives in San Clemente. "It took me 
until I was 40 years old to discover I was also supposed to be a storyteller." 
</P>
<P>
It began with stories for his three daughters. Then "their teachers asked me to 
tell stories at school to the other children," he said. "I liked that." 
</P>
<P>
So much, in fact, that he's still telling stories before school groups and 
others, and charging money for it. For an hourlong "gig," as he calls a 
storytelling assignment, he charges anywhere from $300 to $500. The school 
visits, which are usually paid for by parent-teacher groups, are less. 
</P>
<P>
He has a number of oral histories in his repertoire, he said, but it's sagas 
about the sea that give him the most pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a close relationship with the sea," he said. "I love to sail and love 
the sea." 
</P>
<P>
"Storytelling belongs as part of every young person's education," he says, 
pointing out that being a storyteller is one way of being a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact of life is that any performing artist who brings out anything of 
substance to an audience is a teacher," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Although he enjoys performing for students of all ages, he finds that those 
between 12 and 18 are the most challenging. 
</P>
<P>
"Adolescents are in a period of growing up and experiencing autonomy and 
becoming rather demanding of the world around them," he said. "They won't take 
pap." 
</P>
<P>
One of his stories is about a young girl in the middle of the 19th Century who 
worked in a coal mine and had an extremely tough life. 
</P>
<P>
In listening to the story, he says, "kids experience the same life and 
experience the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, not from the facts, but 
from the feeling about that time." 
</P>
<P>
For adults, he says, storytelling is more an entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
He performed recently at a formal event for the Festival of Whales in Dana 
Point. For that date, he wrote "The Ballad of Moby Dick," a 28-verse story 
based on the Melville novel. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was in (formal clothes) except me," he said. "I was in dungarees, sea 
boots, a turtleneck sweater and a sailor's hat." 
</P>
<P>
The performance was to have been his first accompanied by music from a symphony 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately," he said, "the conductor who was writing the music for it died 
a couple of weeks before the show, so we had to cancel the music part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Dobyns hopes, though, that he will get another chance at something like that. 
</P>
<P>
Although he prefers concert settings for his storytelling, he said, he can be 
found performing in several kinds of environments. 
</P>
<P>
"Some fellow just asked me to do a gig for his daughter's wedding -- to tell 
stories at the reception," Dobyns said. Dobyns said he plans to talk about the 
joys of marriage -- no doubt a reflection of his own life. He has been married 
25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Dobyns is a member of the National Assn. for the Preservation and Perpetuation 
of Story Tellers based in Tennessee. He also makes yearly trips to the Mystic 
Sea Festival in Mystic, Conn., where storytellers from all over the world meet 
to listen to one another's yarns. 
</P>
<P>
Dobyns, however, said his best times are performing at schools. 
</P>
<P>
"The most thrilling experience is to sit in front of a classroom and look at 
their faces and see that they are someplace else because of the story I'm 
telling them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledgments -- James Leyva, a third grade pupil at Las Positas Elementary 
School in La Habra, received a Merit Citation from the American Automobile 
Assn. for his poster in the association's 46th Annual School Traffic Safety 
Poster program. His poster was chosen from among 68,219 entries nationwide. The 
contest is designed to encourage children to learn traffic safety behavior.

A woman who left her twin daughters in the mall at Fashion Valley to avoid an 
arrest for shoplifting pleaded guilty Monday to child abandonment and petty 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
Della May Youngblood, 20, of La Mesa, who is also known as Delia Washington, 
entered her pleas before San Diego Municipal Judge Allan Preckel. 
</P>
<P>
She faces one year in jail when she is sentenced July 30. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-year-old girls were taken to Hillcrest Receiving Home on June 19 after 
the incident occurred. They are now living in a temporary foster home, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Sickles, and further hearings are expected in 
Juvenile Court concerning their custody. 
</P>
<P>
Youngblood is pregnant and was in custody Monday at the County Jail at Las 
Colinas in lieu of $15,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Security guards tried to arrest her on suspicion of stealing three dresses from 
the J.C. Penney store. Youngblood left her daughters in a stroller and took off 
in her car, said the prosecutor.

DOCTOR IS UNSAFE TO PRACTICE, BOARD CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State medical authorities are seeking to revoke or suspend the license of a 
Woodland Hills doctor they charge has a mental disorder that may render him 
unable to safely practice medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Edward V. Madey suffers from borderline personality disorder and has shown 
"impaired judgment . . . that may affect his ability to practice medicine in a 
way that would ensure safety to those to whom he administers as well as to 
himself," the Medical Board of California said in a complaint made public 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Madey could not be reached for comment. Deputy Atty. Gen. Nancy Ann Stoner, who 
prepared the complaint for the board, said Madey has filed a notice that he 
intends to defend himself against the charges, brought in May. No hearing date 
has been set. 
</P>
<P>
Medical board executive director Kenneth Wagstaff said in the complaint that 
Madey twice tried to kill himself in 1982 and was twice hospitalized for "a 
major depressive syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
Wagstaff said that in a series of letters in 1985 and 1986 to his ex-wife, her 
family and attorney, Madey also threatened repeatedly to commit suicide "if his 
financial demands were not met." 
</P>
<P>
Stoner said she was not aware that any of Madey's patients had experienced 
problems with him. She also said she could not elaborate on the content of his 
letters. 
</P>
<P>
Madey voluntarily underwent a psychiatric evaluation in 1988 and was determined 
to be suffering from borderline personality disorder, said Stoner. She said the 
American Psychiatric Assn. defines the disorder as a "pervasive pattern of 
instability of self-image, interpersonal relationships and mood, beginning by 
early adulthood." 
</P>
<P>
An APA diagnostic manual said those suffering from the disorder often make 
repeated suicide threats and have trouble controlling their anger. 
</P>
<P>
Vern Leeper, the medical board's enforcement chief, said the board files 
charges against doctors with psychiatric problems about once a month.

TRANSIENT DROWNS AFTER DRUG OVERDOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The body of an apparent drowning victim was found Monday in the Los Angeles 
River south of White Oak Avenue and Victory Boulevard, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old man, a transient whose identity was withheld pending 
notification of his relatives, appeared to have drowned accidentally in the 
five-inch deep, six-foot-wide wash that runs down the middle of the concrete 
riverbed, said Detective Phil Quartararo. 
</P>
<P>
The man was reportedly disoriented due to an overdose of sleeping pills he took 
after being told he could no longer live in a nearby house where he had been 
staying, Quartararo said. The overdose was not fatal in itself, but the man 
staggered into the riverbed and collapsed face-down in the water, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The body was spotted by passers-by from an overpass about 6 a.m. Monday, police 
said.

Although the military government of Myanmar now officially recognizes that the 
opposition won recent elections, it has shown few signs of turning over real 
power, diplomats in Yangon, the capital of what was formerly Burma, said. On 
Sunday, the regime announced the last result in the May 27 election for a new 
national assembly, confirming a landslide victory for the opposition National 
League for Democracy. The junta had promised to hand over power after the 
multi-party elections, but "the military is proceeding as if the elections 
never took place," said one diplomat.

U.S. ADMINISTRATION SUSPENDS DIALOGUE WITH ARAFAT'S PLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is difficult to understand the omissions in The Times' coverage of President 
Bush's decision to end talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization (front 
page, June 21). Your story did not mention that the U.S. cut off the dialogue 
because the PLO did not live up to the dialogue agreement. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, when the Reagan Administration opened the dialogue, U.N. Ambassador 
Thomas Pickering made clear that there were conditions to the continuation of 
the talks. "In the event of a terrorist action by any element of the PLO, we 
expect that you not only condemn this action publicly, but also discipline 
those responsible for it, at least expelling them from the PLO." 
</P>
<P>
When the PLO failed to speak out against the May 30 beach attacks in Tel Aviv 
or reprimand Abul Abbas, the Palestine Liberation Front mastermind, the Bush 
Administration simply acted on previously articulated policy. 
</P>
<P>
Your coverage was misleading in that it made Abbas seem like a PLO outsider by 
referring to the PLF as a "splinter group." The PLF has never separated itself 
from the PLO; in fact, Abbas, who was also responsible for the death of 
American Leon Klinghoffer, holds a seat on the elite PLO executive committee.

Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi ordered members of the youth wing of his 
opposition Congress-I party to physically stop Amnesty International officials 
from entering India to investigate alleged human rights abuses. The government 
last week lifted a six-month ban on the London-based organization's entry to 
India after members of the U.S. Congress urged New Delhi to allow it to visit 
Punjab and Kashmir to investigate alleged excesses by security forces battling 
separatist militants.

U.S. ADMINISTRATION SUSPENDS DIALOGUE WITH ARAFAT'S PLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decision to suspend talks with the PLO as announced by President Bush is 
commendable. How can we continue to communicate with an organization that does 
not denounce terrorism enacted by a faction of its movement? 
</P>
<P>
Now to be fair and equitable, courageous and objective, the President has to 
suspend diplomatic relations with the government in Tel Aviv until Israel stops 
shooting teen-agers, tear-gassing infants, breaking stone-throwers bones, 
blowing up houses, deporting residents, silencing poets, starving villages, 
financing illegal acquisitions and settling refugees in the occupied 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
The President knows that statehood does not legitimize terrorism. Stop the flow 
of U.S. funds to Israel and see if Israeli officials will be motivated to call 
the White House for peace talks.

Researchers said manufacturers of mini-vans and light trucks should voluntarily 
implement safety regulations that already are mandatory for passenger cars. If 
they don't, the California Public Interest Research Group said in a report, 
thousands more lives will be lost in the next six years until the federal 
government orders their use. The report said such safety features as front-seat 
passive restraints, head rests, shoulder restraints, crush-resistant roofs and 
reinforced side-door strength are urgently needed for mini-vans and light 
trucks.

MILLION-DOLLAR VIEW COMES CHEAP IN CITY-OWNED OCEAN BLUFF HOUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The term subsidized housing has taken on a new meaning in upscale Palos Verdes 
Estates. 
</P>
<P>
Just ask Jim Hendrickson, who became the community's city manager last fall 
with a contract that allows him to live rent-free in a bluff-top house with 
post-card views of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just amazing to sit in the living room and all you see is the ocean," 
Hendrickson said. 
</P>
<P>
If Hendrickson stumbled onto a good deal, so did two city police officers who 
live on the same street. Their houses also are on the bluffs and have ocean 
views. The officers don't get free rent, but their contract with the city calls 
for them to make only $400 worth of improvements to their houses each month. 
</P>
<P>
The good housing deals have come about because of a dozen lawsuits filed 
against the city over the past decade. Residents of Palos Verdes Drive West, in 
an area known as Bluff Cove, contended that their properties were undermined by 
water from a faulty city storm drain. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city has vigorously defended itself, it has nevertheless found 
itself the reluctant owner of six houses. Three are occupied by the city 
employees. The city later will take possession of the other three under the 
terms of various legal settlements. 
</P>
<P>
Of the remaining six houses involved in the lawsuits, the city could wind up 
owning two more, depending on the outcome of litigation. Three were razed 
because they were uninhabitable, and another was kept by the owners as part of 
their legal settlement. 
</P>
<P>
City officials maintain that the three houses occupied by the employees are 
safe to live in, even though 20 to 30 feet of Hendrickson's back yard long ago 
fell over a cliff and into the ocean. The city's assurances notwithstanding, 
the houses sat vacant and became popular hangouts for transients and revelers 
until four years ago. That's when the two police officers inquired about living 
in them. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members, seeing a way to upgrade, maintain and provide security 
for the houses -- and provide housing for employees who otherwise could not 
afford to live in the city -- went along with the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"We're making the best out of a bad situation," Councilwoman Ruth Gralow said. 
</P>
<P>
In Hendrickson's case, the city evicted a police officer who had lived in the 
house for two years and offered it to him rent-free, providing he would accept 
a salary lower than he would make elsewhere. Hendrickson agreed to accept 
$65,000 a year, a good $15,000 to $20,000 less than the city would have had to 
pay otherwise, Gralow said. 
</P>
<P>
Hendrickson said he has put $11,800 of his money into fixing up the house, 
installing new plumbing, carpets, blinds and wallpaper. With the rent-free 
house came a clause in his contract requiring him to be available around the 
clock. A direct telephone line to the Police Department has been installed in 
the house, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've told a number of people I am never going to live in as nice a home 
again," said Hendrickson, who was formerly San Clemente's city manager. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Black, one of the two police officers who initially approached the city 
about living in the residences, said his house was a "basic fixer-upper" when 
he moved into it. Because he was a construction worker before he became a 
police officer, he had the skills to do the work himself, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Darin Kasten, who lives next door to Black, said his house sat vacant 
for seven years before he moved in. The windows had all been broken and the 
floors destroyed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just like an open shell," Kasten said. 
</P>
<P>
Under their contracts with the city, Hendrickson and the officers have agreed 
not to hold the city liable should the land become unstable. All three said 
they do not worry about that happening. 
</P>
<P>
And although Hendrickson will not be forced to move as long as he is city 
manager, no such security is offered to the police officers. Their housing 
contracts with the city can be canceled any month. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some city officials have suggested that the houses, situated in a 
neighborhood where dwellings easily sell for seven figures, could be used to 
entice other top administrators to the city. But if that happens, Black said, 
he will have no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
"If they asked me to leave tomorrow, I would be happy because I have had four 
good years."

<P>
A dialogue that achieved nothing was suspended because of a military raid that 
achieved nothing. It is amazing how non-events make the news these days. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension did show U.S. double standards (non-killing of Israelis was 
"punished" while actual killing of Palestinians is constantly financed).

POLICE DEPARTMENT 'FIRES' A BAD DOG

<TEXT>
<P>
After 2 1/2 years on the job and $6,000 in training, Marko the police dog was 
deemed a flop and "fired" from the Sunnyvale Public Safety Department, a police 
spokesman said. "It's hard to say why the dog wasn't a good police dog," Capt. 
Steve Pigott said. 
</P>
<P>
"His performance just was not very productive." Marko, a German shepherd who 
joined the force in January, 1987, was replaced by a young upstart named 
Gauner. Three hours into his first job, Gauner made his first "find" -- a 
suspect in hiding. Since then, he has detected two other suspects trying to 
hide from officers, Pigott said. In his more than than two years on the force, 
Marko made only "four or five finds," the captain said. Although Marko is out 
of police work, his life hasn't gone to the dogs. He will live out his 
retirement at the home of his officer-handler, Pigott said.

<P>
What an excellent idea. I can't believe how blind our human race is. "Terminate 
pregnancy" -- please, just state the facts. To kill an unborn human being 
because of his or her place of residence, the mother's womb. 
</P>
<P>
Women do have rights -- not to have sex, and not to get pregnant via 
contraceptives. But should we really have the right to take another's unborn 
life? 
</P>
<P>
These unborn children are alive. Can we really continue to deny what is 
happening -- killing. Whether you "want" a child or not is a moot point. You 
have the child already. Letting the child live or die is the issue. We don't 
always get what we "want." But to kill a human being unborn isn't a "right" for 
anyone to have. Go Louisiana!

COUNCIL CUTS TIES TO EVENTS ADVERTISING LIQUOR FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the behest of Mayor Brad Parton, who has criticized the city for appearing 
to condone the use of alcohol, the Redondo Beach City Council has unanimously 
passed two measures distancing the city from major civic events sponsored by 
beer and liquor companies. 
</P>
<P>
The council reiterated an earlier decision to prohibit the city's fledgling 
Visitors Bureau from promoting Redondo Beach to tourists through advertisements 
for alcohol-sponsored events. 
</P>
<P>
The action would, for example, prevent the bureau from advertising the city as 
"the home of the Miller Lite Super Bowl Sunday 10K" race. It is an 
internationally known competition that, for nearly a decade, has drawn tens of 
thousands of runners and spectators to the beach city. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the council took back a longstanding financial break for such 
events, voting for the first time in recent years not to waive fees for the use 
of police and other city services for two festivals where beer is advertised 
and served. 
</P>
<P>
The annual Springfest and the city's Frontier Days, two fund-raisers for 
neighborhood divisions of the Chamber of Commerce, will have to pay about 
$5,000 each in extra fees next year unless they find nonalcoholic sponsors and 
stop serving beer, the council decided. 
</P>
<P>
The decision came despite protests from the local Chamber of Commerce director, 
who warned that the events would fail without the waiver and the promise of 
cold beer for thirsty revelers. 
</P>
<P>
"These are good community events," chamber Executive Director Ernie O'Dell 
said. "I understand where you're coming from regarding alcohol, but some of 
these events are as popular as they are only because of the alcohol." 
</P>
<P>
A council majority agreed with O'Dell and first voted to waive all the fees. 
But Parton vetoed the decision moments later, setting up the second vote. 
</P>
<P>
Parton suggested that if the groups involved were unable to find a dry sponsor, 
they should ask the city to make up the financial difference. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what the mayor is saying is, let's start promoting events not having 
to do with alcohol," said Councilwoman Barbara Doerr, who eventually voted for 
the measures, despite initial opposition to the Visitors Bureau restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
After Parton threatened to veto funding for the planned bureau unless its 
promotions were restricted to non-alcohol-related events, Doerr criticized 
Parton, a "born-again" Christian, saying that it was inappropriate for him "to 
impose his personal beliefs on people." 
</P>
<P>
Later, however, Doerr was more supportive. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it would be better to see a yogurt company something, instead of a 
Budweiser something," she said, smiling, " -- although I like Budweiser." 
</P>
<P>
Parton said his position on the motions had less to do with his religion than 
with a political philosophy that the city should not spend money on events 
promoting alcohol at the same time that it is paying for social programs to 
discourage alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's not city money, they can promote marijuana if they want to," the 
30-year-old mayor joked.

A BRUSH WITH THE GHOSTS OF ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA BLANDFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On days that the city crowds in, that the eye tires of the Los Angeles door 
(bigger than the house), or the wretchedness of the street, there is a longing 
to be elsewhere. The spirit pines for noises that are not man-made, for 
yesteryear's language with its space between words. 
</P>
<P>
In such a mood, one is drawn to the highway, and, as chance would have it, to 
Sunland. 
</P>
<P>
Others' corners, others' lives: how rarely we cross, shut into our cars, 
blindly crawling, like ants, along our narrow paths. And, indeed, at first in 
Sunland there is no sense of having traveled anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Bob's Big Boy, McDonald's, Sizzler, Thrifty, Payless: man's plastic logos 
stretch mile upon mile. But St. Gabriel's mountains rise right behind the main 
street. On clear days in downtown Los Angeles, they are distant, postcard 
mountains. Here they are fierce outposts of prehistory. They defy man's 
franchises and conformity. 
</P>
<P>
How could it have been for the early settlers, arriving dusty and frightened by 
train in Los Angeles from far away? Heavy-faced farmers with sickly wives, 
slight, uncertain businessmen with motherless children, spinsters who had 
toiled too long in offices and bachelors who had taken to hiding from life. 
Their savings tied in purses hung around their necks, their hopes quickened for 
finding a friendly land, a friendly climate. 
</P>
<P>
Looking up at the implacable mountains, the familiarity of McDonalds and 
Jack-in-the-Box makes more sense. How much it must have meant to those early 
landsmen to find flying in this valley the same comforting Stars and Stripes 
that flew in Kansas and Michigan. It is too easy to forget that in this huge 
country, our memories are of traveling far and anxiously, looking always for 
signs of welcome. 
</P>
<P>
All that was here then -- all that God had left -- were rocks and a stubborn 
soil, brush and rattlesnakes. Fires that burned for seven days. Floods that 
poured boulders and stones down through the canyons. What courage the newcomers 
had to bring to life vineyards and orchards here. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of those old-timers are few, on the surface: some olive trees survive 
down by the Big Tujunga wash where, for years, a famous olive bottling factory 
stood. There is a home or two built of rocks carried from the wash, the smell 
of sage, the sound of wind blowing, of bird calls carrying far out by the 
canyon; slowly the past takes shape. 
</P>
<P>
Along the back streets of Sunland, there is an ease that most of us have 
forgotten. Chickens scratch, children run from yard to yard; the notices are 
for dogs found, not dogs lost. In the bar of Sterlings restaurant, old and worn 
with bald red plush and deep, mid-day darkness, the men and women drinking at 
the bar do not even turn a head as the stranger enters. Few in the city have 
such confidence. 
</P>
<P>
In the Salvation Army thrift shop, 30 and 40 years of history lie in bins and 
hang on racks. In this enormous cave are familiar old plastic cups and saucers, 
fussy lamps and desks, forgotten records, china puppies, teddy bears and dolls, 
squirrel boleros and spindly tables. It is as though 1959 had been frozen here 
-- as though each of the old TVs, if turned on, would show President Eisenhower 
at peace. 
</P>
<P>
Next door is another thrift shop, an Aladdin's cave of vintage clothing. Out 
front are the '50s and '60s, lovingly preserved and pressed. Poodle skirts, 
straw hats with veils, long white gloves. Sandra Dee prom frocks. Jackie 
Kennedy pillboxes to perch on beehives. Petticoats and taffeta, crepe and net. 
</P>
<P>
On weekends, they come here from the city to put together fashion outfits, club 
costumes -- the world of dazzle and lightly tended money. During the week, 
locals come in -- fingering the chiffon shyly, smiling wistfully at 
narrow-waisted strapless dresses, hearts fluttering under shapeless 2X shirts 
at reminders of young and slender days. 
</P>
<P>
In a back room, behind a beaded curtain, a "museum" has been created. The 
finest outfits on sale, from a century and half a century ago: top hats, rich 
velvets, boa jackets, feather-light silk knickers, flapper hats with peacock 
feathers, flowing crepe tea gowns. Costume museums show less than this. 
</P>
<P>
It is the old clothes, the very old ones, that work the strongest spell. 
Visiting outfits from the turn of the century, white lace summertime dresses, 
handmade with lace trimmings saved from dress to dress, a poke bonnet of 
velvet, a black-beaded dress covered with tucks and pleats, topped with ruched 
balloon sleeves. Who sewed these perfect, minute stitches? Whose hands turned 
the seams by kerosene lamplight in the nights of those hot, hard summers? The 
clothes are small -- how short and fragile were these women who held themselves 
upright through heat, despair, temptation. Their spirits linger here, for these 
are the clothes they saved, the ones they laid away in dried flowers and 
memories. 
</P>
<P>
We do not have to travel far; we simply have to pay attention.

GENETIC ENGINEERING ACHIEVES 'MAJOR STEP' TOWARD HEMOPHILIA CURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Implants of genetically engineered skin cells in dogs with hemophilia B, a rare 
bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly, can bring the 
symptoms under control for short periods, according to researchers from the 
Salk Institute in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Although the researchers have many technical obstacles to overcome before the 
new approach can produce a cure in the animals, their research, reported Monday 
in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, represents 
a bold new approach to this genetic disorder, which is now treated with an 
expensive protein isolated from concentrated blood plasma. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major step forward toward a cure for hemophilia," said hematologist 
Frederick Rickles of the University of Connecticut School of Medicine. "I think 
it's just terribly exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Hemophilia afflicts as many as 20,000 males in the United States. Women can 
carry the gene for the disorder, but generally do not develop it. 
</P>
<P>
It is caused by a defective gene that would normally serve as a blueprint for a 
protein that plays a crucial role in the clotting process that prevents people 
from bleeding to death after being cut or wounded. It exists in two main forms, 
called A and B. 
</P>
<P>
Hemophilia A, the more common form and the type which is associated with 
European royalty, is caused by a defect in a protein called Factor VIII. 
Hemophilia B, also known as Christmas disease after the surname of the first 
two people diagnosed with it, is caused by a defect in a protein called Factor 
IX. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the only treatment for either type is injections of either Factor 
VIII or Factor IX isolated from the blood of healthy individuals. Because the 
proteins are present in blood in only very small quantities, large volumes of 
blood must be pooled for the isolation procedure, greatly increasing the risk 
that the material will be contaminated with the viruses that cause hepatitis or 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 90% to 95% of the nation's 7,000 to 9,000 hemophiliacs with the 
most severe cases of the disease are thought to be infected with the AIDS 
virus. Among moderate hemophiliacs, who require fewer injections, the infection 
rate is thought to be 40% to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have developed techniques to cleanse blood products of viruses, but 
the isolated protein is very expensive. A year's treatment may cost as much as 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative to collecting Factor VIII from blood, researchers have 
produced it in the laboratory using genetic engineering techniques. This 
product has been successfully tested in humans, but the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration has not approved it for marketing. Genetically engineered Factor 
IX has not yet been tested in humans. 
</P>
<P>
The new research reported Monday opens the door to a technique by which 
hemophiliacs would produce the protein in their own body. 
</P>
<P>
The research was conducted using dogs that suffer from hemophilia B. They are 
maintained in a unique colony at the University of North Carolina in Chapel 
Hill by pathologists Marjorie S. Read and Kenneth M. Brinkhous. Called keagles, 
the animals arose from a cross between a cairn terrier and a beagle, and the 
colony has been maintained for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Salk Institute molecular biologists Jonathan H. Axelrod and Inder M. Verma took 
skin cells from keagles and used a specially designed virus to introduce a 
healthy gene for Factor IX into them. Their paper reports that the cells 
produce and secrete Factor IX. 
</P>
<P>
Axelrod and Verma have constructed mini-organs with the engineered cells and 
implanted them under the skin of the keagles. The implant produces Factor IX 
for at least a few weeks, and the animals' blood will clot normally, Axelrod 
said. But the clotting time gets longer and longer, indicating failure of the 
implant. 
</P>
<P>
So far, he said, "we can't pinpoint a specific problem." It may be that the 
cells are dying or that they stop producing Factor IX. The researchers are 
trying to isolate and correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not discouraged by that," said Rickles, vice president of medical affairs 
for the National Hemophilia Foundation. "While it may take some time, we are on 
the right track."

An off-duty county security officer shot and critically wounded a man in an 
early-morning traffic dispute Monday on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, 
sheriff's deputies said. The Los Angeles County safety officer was questioned 
but not arrested following the incident, which occurred about 12:45 a.m in the 
19500 block, Deputy Hal Grant said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer's name was not released. Wounded was Fred Inouye, 25, of 
Chatsworth, who was hit once in the chest by one of four shots fired by the 
officer. He was in critical condition at UCLA Medical Center. Grant said the 
officer had suddenly swerved while driving, causing Inouye to take evasive 
action. The two vehicles stopped, and Inouye got out of his car and walked up 
to the officer's truck. As the men began arguing, the officer allegedly fired a 
gun and hit Inouye in the chest. When Inouye retreated to the back of the 
truck, the officer fired three more shots but missed.

BELCHER EMPHATICALLY REFUTES CRITICS AS DODGERS BEAT CUBS, 3-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Belcher, last year the exclamation point to the Dodgers' pitching staff but 
more recently a question mark, quieted some doubts Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Before a Dodger Stadium crowd of 32,600, Belcher ended the Chicago Cubs' 
five-game winning streak with a 3-1 complete-game victory. 
</P>
<P>
Relying on breaking balls, Belcher gave up only five singles in a tidy 2 hours 
8 minutes -- the Dodgers' fastest game of the season -- and was only tested 
once, when the Cubs scored in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
It was Belcher's first complete game since May 1 and with any luck it could 
have been his first shutout since early April. One oddity of Belcher's 
110-pitch performance was he had only one strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
But the pitcher who battled for the National League strikeout lead and had 
eight shutouts a year ago was 1-4 in his last five starts, and was happy to 
improve to 6-6. 
</P>
<P>
"My fastball is just not there yet. I'm working on my arm strength," Belcher 
said. "Location, location, location -- that more than anything. I had good 
control, I stayed ahead of the hitters. I made good pitches to their good 
hitters." 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers took a 3-0 lead after three innings against Jeff Pico (4-1), but 
didn't make the most of their scoring opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Lenny Harris, Chris Gwynn and Kal Daniels led off the Dodger first inning with 
consecutive, hard-hit singles to score one run, and with one out Hubie Brooks 
singled to score another. But Rick Dempsey grounded into a double play to end 
the inning. 
</P>
<P>
The third inning started similarly, Gwynn opening with another line-drive 
single and Eddie Murray hitting a one-out double to put runners on second and 
third. Brooks was walked intentionally to load the bases, and Dempsey followed 
with a broken-bat grounder to first baseman Mark Grace. Grace bobbled the ball 
and any chance for a double play, getting the out at first while Gwynn scored 
what turned out to be the Dodgers' last run. 
</P>
<P>
"They were getting good hacks," Pico said. "I was trying to keep 3-0 from 
becoming 5-0. The way Belcher was throwing, three was enough for him." 
</P>
<P>
Belcher, who has acknowledged having a tired arm lately, came into the game 
with a 4.28 earned-run average -- the highest in the rotation. But he breezed 
through the early innings, facing the minimum through four and not giving up a 
hit until Luis Salazar singled with two out in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a real pitcher," Cub shortstop Shawon Dunston said. "I know they say he's 
not throwing hard, but it looked like 95 (m.p.h.) to me. We were sitting on the 
bench saying, 'Damn.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs mounted a minor threat in the seventh. With one out, Grace and Dawson 
reached on a walk and a single, moving into scoring position on a groundout to 
first. But Belcher got Salazar on a popup to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
Belcher survived a tougher test in the eighth. Dunston led off with a grounder 
that third baseman Lenny Harris, who made several excellent fielding plays, 
speared. But this time Harris pulled Murray off the bag with an off-balance 
throw and Dunston had an infield single. Girardi followed with a grounder that 
skipped past Harris. 
</P>
<P>
Belcher walked Dwight Smith to load the bases. That brought up Ryne Sandberg, 
and resulted in a mound consultation with pitching coach Ron Perranoski. 
Sandberg ended the shutout with a sacrifice fly, but Belcher retired Grace to 
escape with minimal damage. 
</P>
<P>
"For (Perranoski) to let me stay out there was really a confidence builder," 
Belcher said. 
</P>
<P>
Said catcher Rick Dempsey of Belcher: "He was real sharp. He made a great pitch 
to Sandberg. Tonight was a good indicator we might have him back to his form of 
last year." 
</P>
<P>
Belcher worked a perfect ninth. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked to me like he got stronger as the game went on," Sandberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
As expected, the Dodgers activated left-handed reliever Ray Searage and 
optioned Jim Poole to double-A San Antonio. Another spot on the staff opened 
when reliever Don Aase was placed on the 21-day disabled list because of 
rotator cuff tendinitis. In his place, the Dodgers called up left-hander Terry 
Wells, who was acquired from Houston for Franklin Stubbs April 1. Wells, 26, 
was 7-3 at triple-A Albuquerque after a spotty six-year minor league career and 
is the latest contender for the fifth starting spot. The 6-foot-3, 205-pound 
Wells will start tonight against the Cubs, pushing Fernando Valenzuela to 
Wednesday and Ramon Martinez to Thursday. That makes it unlikely Martinez will 
pitch again before the All-Star break, making him a candidate to pitch in 
Tuesday's All-Star game in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president, said of the rotation change: "It 
had absolutely nothing to do with the All-Star game. We wanted to get out of 
(the four-man rotation) as soon as possible. We were considering starting Tim 
Crews, but when Aase couldn't pitch (Sunday) we had to use Tim in that game. 
Wells has pitched well his last two starts." 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Kirk Gibson and catcher Mike Scioscia were out of Monday's lineup 
because of sore legs. Stan Javier was sidelined with a jammed left index 
finger.

WESTLAKE'S HESS JOINS CLU BASKETBALL STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Hess, who coached the Westlake High basketball team to three consecutive 
Southern Section playoff appearances, resigned as Westlake coach Monday to join 
the Cal Lutheran staff as a junior varsity coach and varsity assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Hess, 34, said that he had been looking for an opportunity to combine graduate 
studies with college coaching when he approached CLU Coach Mike Dunlap, who 
told him to consider the newly created coaching position at Cal Lutheran. 
</P>
<P>
Hess was selected from among 10 candidates and will be in effect a graduate 
assistant, combining coaching with work in Cal Lutheran's MBA program. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that for my long-range plans," Hess said, "it's the right move to 
make." 
</P>
<P>
CLU is beginning the JV program in order to fulfill one of the requirements for 
the school's move into the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Fisher, Westlake athletic director, said he will meet Thursday with school 
principal Curt Luft to outline a strategy for hiring Hess's replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Hess, a 1978 graduate of the University of Calgary, had a 44-31 record (22-14 
in the Marmonte League play) in three seasons.

SDSU RAISES $1 MILLION FOR ATHLETIC DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego State President Tom Day announced Monday that local residents and 
businesses have donated or pledged a total of $1 million over the next seven 
years in an effort to eliminate the $518,000 budget deficit facing the Aztec 
athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement puts a successful end to the school's nine-week fund drive 
designed to aid a department that has been operating in the red for nearly a 
decade. But, it doesn't mean that the deficit is immediately eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Turner, a 1954 SDSU graduate who led the fund drive, said his group has 
collected $300,000 in cash -- the remaining $700,000 is in pledges. And, of the 
cash in hand, $125,000 is committed to a marketing campaign for Aztec 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
The department also faces the probability that the deficit has increased after 
the 1989-90 fiscal year, which ended Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Herrick, SDSU associate athletic director for business affairs, is in the 
process of finishing the paperwork but said he expects the athletic department 
will once again wind up owing money -- although he said he didn't yet know how 
much. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be much, though," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Garretson, California State University system controller, said that in 
Nov., 1989, the chancellor's office and SDSU agreed the school was committed to 
reducing the deficit on the state books to $375,000 by June 30, 1990, and then 
reduce the deficit by $125,000 in each of the next three years so that the 
deficit would be eliminated by June 30, 1993. Garretson said the state 
considers SDSU's debt to be $500,000. By obtaining the $300,000 in cash, SDSU 
will be able pay the $125,000 owed the state. 
</P>
<P>
"From our standpoint, that was the contract and they've met that goal," 
Garretson said. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Miller, SDSU athletic director, said SDSU plans to continue covering what 
is left of the deficit by borrowing against the pledged money. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that SDSU isn't obligated to pay off its financial debt to the 
state until 1993, school officials were happy and relieved Monday as they 
talked about the $1 million they raised. The elimination of the deficit was one 
aspect of a three-part plan introduced by Day in April -- better marketing of 
SDSU athletics and an investigation into conference affiliations other than the 
Western Athletic Conference were the other two. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we're very pleased to announce that we've had a successful completion of 
a key part of our effort -- the elimination of the deficit that for years has 
been sapping the image and the strength of our intercollegiate athletics," Day 
said. "It's really a tremendous achievement, particularly since we've been 
doing this in a very short period of time. We announced that we intended to do 
it in April, and we're announcing at the beginning of July that we've done it." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Turner nor Miller said they were concerned that some of the money 
pledged to the SDSU athletic deparment would not arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"The caliber of people and pledges are such that you really are not nervous 
about any collection problem," Turner said. "The experiences that the athletic 
department has had with Golden Aztec Ring and other significant contributions 
or pledges have identified very little collection problems. The 39 persons or 
companies are all substantial individuals, otherwise they wouldn't be pledging 
this money." 
</P>
<P>
Turner said that there is not much overlap between the people his group 
contacted and people who normally contribute to SDSU via groups such as the 
Golden Aztec Ring or Aztec Athletic Foundation. Of the 39 people who will be 
donating money, Turner said, only between six and eight would overlap. 
</P>
<P>
"That would not really amount to that much (money) each year," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
Turner added that a potentially large area was left relatively untapped in his 
group's effort -- SDSU alumni. 
</P>
<P>
"A good portion of the people who made the commitment were people who were not 
SDSU alumni, but were individuals within the community who felt San Diego 
deserved a strong collegiate athletic program," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
One, Rod Wells of Arthur Andersen, said his company donated $25,000 -- to be 
paid over seven years -- because of its community standing. 
</P>
<P>
"As a public accounting firm, we see SDSU as a major resource for us," he said. 
"We didn't like the fact that SDSU is not a major player."

PAIR OF TITLES IN THE CARDS FOR ROYAL; 
</P>
<P>
L.A. GAMES: HIGHLANDERS GET A CONFIDENCE BOOST WITH CHAMPIONSHIPS IN 
VOLLEYBALL, SOCCER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADAM BENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A royal flush is the ultimate poker hand, but a Royal pair proved unbeatable in 
the recently concluded L. A. Games. 
</P>
<P>
Royal High was one of only two schools in the competition to win two titles, 
prevailing in boys' volleyball -- beating Marshall, 15-5 -- and boys' soccer -- 
2-1 over Orange. Morningside won championships in football and girls' 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
The Highlander soccer team trailed Southern Section 2-A Division champion 
Orange, 1-0, in the second half of the championship game, having given up its 
only goal in six tournament matches. 
</P>
<P>
But midway through the final half, Royal's Dan Morris knotted the score on a 
penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
Then, with 10 minutes left and overtime becoming more of a possibility, 
midfielder Marco Todesco lured several Orange defenders toward him and passed 
to teammate Ryan Campbell, who scored into the left side of the net from 10 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"After I got by the first guy, more (Orange defenders) came on," Todesco said. 
"I was close, so I could have tried to score, but I was surrounded and I saw 
Ryan Campbell coming down and I passed it off." 
</P>
<P>
The match-winner was Campbell's second goal of the tournament. Freshman goalie 
Brent Thompson, who replaced Steve Hambly after Hambly departed for the Olympic 
development training camp, turned away three Orange shots on goal in Royal's 
win. 
</P>
<P>
Todesco scored one goal and assisted on four others to earn the tournament's 
MVP award. 
</P>
<P>
"Marco is a powerful and skillful player who can do almost anything," Royal 
Coach Peter Schraml said. "He can score, defend and set other players up. He 
did that throughout the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the performance of his star player, Schraml applauded his team's rally 
against one of Orange County's most successful squads. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the first time we were scored on, yet we were able to come back," 
Schraml said. "Orange played physical, but we were able to adjust and play 
physical with them. I liked the comeback. This was a real confidence builder." 
</P>
<P>
The morale booster could serve Schraml's team well as it prepares for the 
upcoming season against archrival and defending Southern Section 4-A Division 
champion Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Royal's volleyball team got a confidence boost from its title as well, even 
though Coach Bob Ferguson's squad has won the Southern Section 4-A Division 
championship each of the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Royal scored a pair of dramatic wins to advance to the final, beating Mira 
Costa, 16-14, in the quarterfinals and University, 15-12, in the semifinals. 
Travis Ferguson, the coach's son, was named the tournament MVP. 
</P>
<P>
Several schools from the region advanced to the later rounds in other sports. 
</P>
<P>
Buena fell to Morningside, 61-47, in the girls' basketball championship game 
but the Bulldogs' Lianne Ishikawa was named the tournament MVP. Ishikawa was 
held scoreless against Morningside but she had 14 assists and nine steals. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the final she was averaging about 13 points, 11 assists and six steals 
for the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside's football team also edged a school from the region in winning the 
football championship, defeating Canyon, 27-20. Canyon had advanced to the 
final with a 13-12 win over archrival Hart.

The Saddest Muppet Show: Fozzie Bear, Gonzo and Oscar the Grouch went to St. 
Paul's Cathedral in London on Monday for a memorial service for Muppet creator 
Jim Henson, who died in May in New York. But Kermit the Frog, whose voice was 
that of the puppet master, was not there. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Big Bird, Henson's 7-foot-tall creation from "Sesame Street," walked 
past the choir in the 17th-Century cathedral and sang Kermit's theme song, 
"Bein' Green." He was followed by a recording of Henson singing Kermit's 
"Rainbow Connection." 
</P>
<P>
Well-wishers were asked not to wear black to the service. Henson's family said 
the event would be as much a celebration and thanksgiving for the puppeteer's 
life as a traditional memorial service. A death-bed message from Henson, read 
by his son Brian, urged people to be good to each other and enjoy life: "It 
feels strange writing this while I am alive, but it sure would be hard after I 
go." GREG BRAXTON

Second City Looks for New West Coast Home: The comedy improvisational troupe 
Second City will give its last Santa Monica performance at the renovated 
Mayfair Theatre on Sunday and has begun looking for a new local home. Andrew 
Alexander, Second City president and executive producer, blamed the closing on 
declining attendance, an earthquake-proposal requirement and alleged 
deteriorating conditions in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"The ongoing problems of the homeless and crime in the beach area have served 
to create a depressed atmosphere, which in turn keeps the night business away," 
said Alexander. Responding to the comment, Santa Monica Mayor Dennis Zane said, 
"I'm very surprised to hear that assessment. . . ." He said the Third Street 
Promenade area was revitalized with the success of several new movie theaters 
and restaurants. "The Improv is doing well," he added. "The scene on the street 
weekends is lively, with many people around." Alexander said that the closing 
does not mean an end to the performance wing of Second City. He's scouting 
locations in Hollywood and West Los Angeles. Meanwhile, after Sunday the 
Mayfair will be dark. GREG BRAXTON

STICK TO REFORM PATH, GORBACHEV URGES PARTY; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: HE DEFENDS HIS PERESTROIKA POLICY. 'DARK TIMES' ARE AHEAD IF 
CONSERVATIVES PREVAIL, HE SAYS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, opening a crucial congress of the Soviet 
Union's ruling Communist Party, defended his program of political and economic 
reforms Monday and appealed for support to prevent a conservative takeover of 
the party leadership that would end perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
"Either Soviet society goes forward along the path of the profound changes that 
have begun," Gorbachev warned, "or forces opposed to perestroika will gain the 
upper hand, and then -- to be honest -- dark times are ahead for the country 
and the people." 
</P>
<P>
In a speech that defended as much as it advanced his reforms, Gorbachev 
attempted to fend off an expected conservative assault on his reform program 
and to consolidate his support at the outset of the 10-day congress. 
</P>
<P>
"There are voices now -- in fact, more than that, an opposition has formed -- 
that says in all our failures, perestroika is to blame," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
This is "simply nonsense," he continued, blaming in turn "the extremely grim 
legacy we inherited" from previous Soviet leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the nearly 4,700 delegates sat in stony silence, however, as Gorbachev 
delivered his three-hour report, all but confirming that they are his critics, 
making up the opposition against whom he was warning the nation in such caustic 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who has come under increasing conservative criticism for the 
political philosophy underlying perestroika as well as for its practical 
failures, also warned his critics on the left that the five-year reform effort 
could be upset "if someone manages to split the democratic forces committed to 
its principles." 
</P>
<P>
"We must act even more resolutely because any delay is sure to aggravate the 
situation in the country," the Soviet leader declared. "One of the serious 
reasons for the difficulties we are encountering in many fields is the 
resistance to change put up by the bureaucratic stratum in the managerial 
structures and by the social forces associated with it." 
</P>
<P>
This political showdown between Gorbachev and his conservative critics had been 
building for weeks before the congress, and at the end of the first day, Vadim 
A. Medvedev, the chief party ideologist and a close Gorbachev adviser, 
portrayed the meeting as perhaps crucial for the forces of perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
"We are living through a critical phase of perestroika," Medvedev told 
reporters. "We are faced with the main issue of where the country will go, 
whether the country will progress or recoil backward. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The danger of a conservative backlash or crackdown is looming larger. This is 
the major problem we are facing here; it is the monumental threat that the 
party congress faces." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Yegor K. Ligachev, the foremost conservative in the present leadership, 
and Ivan K. Polozkov, the new first secretary of the Russian Communist Party 
and an avowed conservative, both reiterated their support of Gorbachev as the 
party's top commander. 
</P>
<P>
And Alexander N. Yakovlev, the leading liberal in the Politburo, drew 
thunderous applause -- far more than any other speaker Monday -- apparently 
with the pure passion of his defense of perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
"Dogmas can be saved for the time being, but history cannot be stopped," 
Yakovlev told the delegates. "Only a renovated, rejuvenated and 
shifted-to-the-left party can lead the country ahead along the way of serious 
changes. This movement is irreversible. It will proceed with the party, or 
without it." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Democratic Platform, a faction in the party that has proposed 
broader and faster reforms, said they feel that Gorbachev had tried to 
accommodate their views in his report and they might reconsider their threat to 
break with the party and establish their own after the congress. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev is trying to define a position for himself between conservatives and 
radicals," Tamara Alaiba, a Democratic Platform delegate from the industrial 
center of Sverdlovsk in the Ural Mountains, said. "But there was not an idea 
that could unite the hall, this party. . . . You must have a great central idea 
or proposal to do that." 
</P>
<P>
But Polozkov, whose election last month as the first secretary of the Russian 
Communist Party makes him one of the country's most powerful conservative 
politicians, was even more dismissive of Gorbachev's report and the ideas in 
it, though still pledging his support to Gorbachev for the party leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"To calm the people would have been the greatest accomplishment," Polozkov said 
after the lengthy speech. "We have talked a lot about things, but done little. 
If people felt that something real was being done, they might respond. 
</P>
<P>
"But there is no food, no gas, no clothing, no nothing, and we sit around 
arguing about power." 
</P>
<P>
In what may prove an important compromise with the conservatives, Gorbachev 
appeared ready Monday to give up his proposal for the restructuring of the 
party leadership to elect a chairman and one or two deputies and a presidium 
made up largely of republican leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Party traditionalists, who probably constitute a majority of the congress, have 
argued in favor of maintaining the party's general secretary, perhaps with a 
deputy, and the Politburo, a longstanding institution. 
</P>
<P>
The change to a presidium headed by a chairman would be more than symbolic 
since it would enforce the decentralization of the political leadership and end 
the concentration of power that the Politburo has always represented. 
</P>
<P>
This issue and others are expected to be debated later this week when delegates 
discuss Gorbachev's report, the proposed party platform and the party's 
reorganization. Originally scheduled to run a week, the congress was extended 
to 10 days within an hour of its opening, and some political commentators 
suggested it could go to 12. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, reminding delegates of how far the country has come in five years, 
catalogued the changes in politics, in the economy, in the way that people 
live, all to rebut conservatives' charges that perestroika is destroying the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"The Stalinist model of socialism is being replaced by a civil society of free 
men and women," Gorbachev said. "The political system is being radically 
transformed, genuine democracy is being established with free elections, a 
multi-party system and human rights, and real government by the people is being 
revived. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The changes were pressing because the country was gathering speed in lapsing 
into a second-rate state," he continued. "By the early 1980s, it had become 
clear that our apparent well-being rested on a savage, wasteful use of natural 
and human resources." 
</P>
<P>
Arguing strongly for political pluralism and a market economy, Gorbachev asked 
for a mandate to broaden and accelerate his reforms despite the conservative 
opposition and the widespread apprehension about the impact of the changes. 
</P>
<P>
Past mistakes and hesitancy "dictate the imperative need to accelerate and 
radicalize the economic reform," he said. "We can no longer tolerate the 
managerial system that rejects scientific and technological progress and new 
technologies, that is committed to cost-ineffectiveness and that generates 
squandering and waste. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The very logic of perestroika and the dramatic social and economic situation 
in the country brings us face to face with the need for fundamental changes in 
the economic system." 
</P>
<P>
He sketched plans for further reforms aimed at transforming what is now largely 
a state-owned, centrally planned economy to one that will be driven by the 
market forces of supply and demand and where entrepreneurship and private 
ownership will be encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
"We regard the market not as a goal in itself, but as a means of making the 
economy more effective and improving the standard of living," Gorbachev said, 
replying to frequent conservative criticism of the plan. "By moving toward a 
market, we are not swerving from the road to socialism, but are advancing 
toward a fuller realization of society's potential." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union will move soon, he said, to permit private ownership in almost 
all areas of the economy, to establish equity and commodity markets, to make 
its currency convertible with Western currencies, to pull the government out of 
industrial management and to reshape central planning to focus on the overall 
strategy for the country's development. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev criticized the government of Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and 
his own Politburo for failing to take a comprehensive approach to economic 
reform earlier and buckling under to the managers of the country's giant 
industries. The leadership had also ignored for too long the growing shortages 
of foodstuffs and consumer goods of all types, he said, and this had compounded 
the crises here. 
</P>
<P>
But he promised that the next reforms would not start with price increases, as 
widely feared, and said that the government would first take steps to ensure 
that workers do not suffer. 
</P>
<P>
"The transition to a market economy cannot start with price hikes -- that is 
absurd," he declared.

WHAT GORBACHEV SAID 
</P>
<P>
Excerpts from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's speech to the 28th Communist 
Party Congress. 
</P>
<P>
On perestroika and party failures: 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet citizen of today no longer accepts what he meekly tolerated in the 
past. He reacts with understandable alarm and anger to the negative phenomena 
that, like foam on the surface, accompany the turbulent and basically healthy 
process of perestroika. . . . 
</P>
<P>
We have inherited a heavy legacy. The deplorable state of our lands and economy 
and the disastrous state of the energy sector . . . are not the result of 
recent years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Politburo does not deny its responsibility for these errors. 
</P>
<P>
We must analyze the situation, and we must see what revolutionary 
transformations will be made, because the U.S.S.R. is rapidly becoming a 
second-rate power. 
</P>
<P>
On human rights: 
</P>
<P>
Human rights will retain priority over the interests of national sovereignty 
and autonomy. This must be entrenched in the constitutional fabric of the union 
and each of the republics. Nor must we depart even an inch from this principle, 
which guides us on the international plane as well. 
</P>
<P>
On chronic shortages: 
</P>
<P>
I would subscribe here to everything that is said on this subject and express 
solidarity with the most scathing criticism. But just fanning emotions won't 
increase the amount of goods. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In any case -- and this should be admitted -- the consequences could have been 
less painful if the government had approached the economic reform 
comprehensively, and had managed to stand up to the pressure of various 
industries and the old managerial structures that sought to keep their position 
and maintain command of administration. 
</P>
<P>
On ethnic strife: 
</P>
<P>
At present, as we embark on a succession of deep-going changes in our 
multinational state, we need tranquillity, peace and cooperation in the 
interests of all nations. I hope that this appeal of our congress will be heard 
in all parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
On Eastern Europe: 
</P>
<P>
Big changes are under way in Eastern Europe. When somebody says that this is 
the "collapse of socialism," we counter it with the question: What socialism? 
That which had been, in point of fact, a variation of Stalin's authoritarian 
bureaucratic system -- which we have ourselves discarded?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PARTY CONGRESS: DAY ONE 
</P>
<P>
Highlights of Monday's session of the 28th Communist Party Congress: 
</P>
<P>
Starting the session: Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet president and party 
leader, opened the congress in the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses to elect a 
party leader and a Central Committee and approve new party rules and platform. 
It is scheduled to last until July 12. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's defense: Gorbachev attacked bureaucrats for hindering his reforms. 
He admitted the party leadership made mistakes during his tenure but also 
blamed the "heavy legacy" of previous leaders dating back to Stalin for food 
and housing shortages, ecological and industrial disasters and ethnic 
conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
Resignation call: Nine minutes after the session started, coal miner Vladimir 
Bludov criticized the leadership for not improving living standards and 
proposed that the Central Committee and Politburo resign. Delegates voted to 
postpone discussion of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Best-received speech: Politburo member and close Gorbachev adviser Alexander N. 
Yakovlev delivered a stirring defense of the Soviet leader and his policies, 
saying they should have come decades sooner. He won over deputies with his 
uncompromising views and clear pride at having helped create perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
Party unity: Outside the session, reformer Sergei Stankevich said the radical 
Democratic Platform faction has scrapped its plans to leave the party at the 
congress. 
</P>
<P>
Party structure: Gorbachev said delegates told him they are against his 
proposal to revamp top party organs and break up the job of party chief -- 
which he holds -- into a chairman, deputy chairman and first secretary.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
East Germany went shopping in the dazzling wonderland of Western consumerism 
Monday, but the orgy of buying that many had predicted failed to occur. 
</P>
<P>
In part overwhelmed by the spectacle itself, East Germans crowded into 
department stores and shops in record numbers but seemed reluctant to part with 
the spanking new deutschemarks they received Sunday as part of the German 
economic, social and currency union. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, many appeared content to stare, then touch and price the thousands of 
Western items appearing in East Germany's retail stores for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people will hang onto their money for a while," predicted an East 
Berlin woman, Luzie Conrad. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that East Germans have an ingrained habit of treating the West German 
mark as a precious commodity to be used only with care. 
</P>
<P>
The absence of a consumer scramble was greeted with a collective sigh of relief 
by policy- makers in Bonn, the West German capital. They had been concerned 
about the inflationary pressures an avalanche of East German consumer buying 
might bring. 
</P>
<P>
Prices on the Frankfurt stock exchange rose sharply on news of the low-keyed 
East German consumer reaction, and the deutschemark rose in European trading. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm impressed by the mood of the people and the mood in the stores," West 
German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann told an East German television 
interviewer during a visit to Dresden. "They are waiting." 
</P>
<P>
Added West German government spokesman Dieter Vogel, "With the D-mark, they 
have won their freedom as consumers. They'll be discerning consumers." 
</P>
<P>
Initial figures from the West German Bundesbank also indicated that East 
Germans withdrew only the equivalent of $2.8 billion from banks on Sunday, the 
first day of the currency union. That figure was nearly a third less than the 
expected amount of about $3.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
To head off any possible spending stampede, East Germans have been limited 
under terms of the currency union to withdrawals totaling no more than the 
equivalent of $1,250 each during the first week. 
</P>
<P>
Several thousand East German workers in the Berlin area, mainly in the 
important metalworking sector, staged brief work stoppages Monday to press 
their demands for higher pay and fewer working hours. 
</P>
<P>
Any major industrial unrest or sharp jump in East German wages in the coming 
months could endanger East Germany's economic recovery and add significantly to 
the cost of German unification, political and economic observers believe. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's events came as one result of the state treaty between East and West 
Germany that effectively united the two German economies by extending West 
German business, financial and social laws, plus the deutschemark, to East 
Germany. The treaty also ended border controls between the two states and set 
them on the road to full political unification. 
</P>
<P>
Like stagehands changing sets between acts of a play, East German retailers 
spent last weekend in a frenzy of remodeling and restocking in advance of the 
start of the country's new commercial era. 
</P>
<P>
By the time stores opened Monday, the country had gone through a collective 
face-lift, with bright Western packaging, creative window displays and colorful 
products ranging from Reebok shoes to Christian Dior cosmetics that only hard 
Western currency can buy. 
</P>
<P>
Most retailers in East Berlin seemed to carry stocks consisting of 60% to 80% 
of Western goods. 
</P>
<P>
At a large stand in East Berlin's central Alexanderplatz, a young couple 
wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the Lucky Strike logo handed out packs of the 
American cigarettes along with a leaflet carrying the words, "Born in the USA." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, a van sold Western soft porn magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer caution seems to have been bolstered by uncertainty over jobs, as East 
Germany's overmanned industry now will begin to slim down to compete with the 
West. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, however, East Germans were also curious and occasionally confused as 
they came to grips with a completely new set of consumer goods most had seen 
only on television or during brief visits to the West. 
</P>
<P>
At a consumer electronics store in the Alexanderplatz, potential customers 
seemed to spend most of their energies trying to understand how to operate 
sophisticated Western television sets and come to grips with items such as a 
Sony Walkman for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
One customer who had come to buy an electric razor was unable to decide after 
being confronted with a choice of several brands. 
</P>
<P>
Only at supermarkets and food stores, where East German goods had gradually 
disappeared in the days before the currency union, were there long lines of 
active buyers as customers waited to restock their refrigerators. 
</P>
<P>
Here, too, the choices were much greater than the food shoppers were used to, 
but many of them complained bitterly about the fourfold to sixfold increases in 
the price of some commodities, the result of the abolition of subsidies for 
staple products such as bread, sugar and meat. 
</P>
<P>
East German television news Monday night showed a young couple in Leipzig 
intently discussing for nearly a full minute the pros and cons of buying a 
single cup of yogurt at a supermarket.

ROOF COLLAPSES AT CAMPUS HALL IN LONG BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE and BETTINA BOXALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The roof of an 8-year-old recital hall at Cal State Long Beach mysteriously 
collapsed Monday morning, flattening two grand pianos and slamming tons of 
concrete and steel onto a seating area that can hold as many as 210 people. 
</P>
<P>
No one was inside the Gerald R. Daniels Recital Hall -- a theater used almost 
daily for concerts and lectures when classes are in session -- when 90% of the 
concrete-reinforced ceiling caved in at midmorning. 
</P>
<P>
Just hours earlier, a group of five high school students had gathered at the 
theater for a Sunday evening music rehearsal. They were ushered away when a 
professor and sound engineer observed half-inch cracks in the plaster and heard 
strange creaks coming from the walls. 
</P>
<P>
Police and firefighters who surveyed the damage said anyone sitting in the 
audience or performing on stage would have been crushed. 
</P>
<P>
"People in the first three rows might have survived. Everyone else would have 
been history," Long Beach firefighter Craig Vestermark said after emerging from 
the theater on the north end of the campus. 
</P>
<P>
Campus officials shut down two adjacent buildings that were constructed in the 
same style by the same architect and contractor. Administrators said they were 
also studying whether other buildings on campus might pose a danger. 
</P>
<P>
"If we find some factor that gives us reason to think there's a flaw in the 
method, we'll do whatever necessary to protect people," said William H. 
Griffith, vice president of administration and finance. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators could not immediately determine how many buildings were 
constructed in a similar style across the California State University system. 
</P>
<P>
The contractor who built the collapsed theater also constructed several other 
buildings in the state university system, including an addition to the art 
building on the Fullerton campus and a student union at Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Campus police were borrowed from nearby universities Monday to stand watch over 
the buckled building. Heavy trucks were diverted off adjacent Atherton Street 
for fear that the slightest vibration would send the walls tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
Administrators said hundreds of lives might have been saved by the timing of 
the collapse. The hall is used for lectures, rehearsals and about 250 musical 
performances a year. During a semester, as many as 800 to 1,000 people pass 
through on an average day. 
</P>
<P>
Classes recessed in mid-May for the summer; the theater's last major event was 
a June 23 fund-raising performance put on by a local arts group that drew about 
20 performers and 100 spectators, campus officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"At 10:30 on a Monday morning during the semester, we would have had a lecture 
class of about 100 people in there. We're all grateful no one was hurt," said 
Donald Para, chairman of the 325-student music department. 
</P>
<P>
A team of inspectors -- including the architect who designed the building and 
the structural engineer who helped erect it -- examined the leaning structure 
from every angle Monday afternoon. They were at a loss, however, to explain why 
a building that opened its doors in April, 1982, would suddenly just fold. 
</P>
<P>
A check of campus inspection records revealed no reported code violations of 
any kind. University officials said all campus buildings undergo annual 
inspections, although they could not say exactly when the theater was last 
reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
"The trusses failed," Don Erb, the structural engineer, said after touring the 
building. He would not elaborate on the cause, however. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite an unfortunate thing. First time any building has fallen down that 
we've done," said Donald Gibbs, co-owner of the Hugh Gibbs &amp; Donald Gibbs 
architectural firm in Long Beach. The firm designed the recital hall as part of 
a $6.3-million office and theater complex built with state funds. 
</P>
<P>
The Gibbs firm also designed the campus's psychology building and is under 
contract as the architect for a new performing arts center scheduled for 
ground-breaking in October, said university spokeswoman Toni Beron. 
</P>
<P>
The building's contractor, Shirley Brothers Inc. of Pasadena, has "a good 
reputation," said Colleen Bentley-Adler, a spokeswoman for the state university 
system. 
</P>
<P>
The contractor could not be reached for comment late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs called the building's construction a conventional "tilt-up" style in 
which the concrete walls are poured, then hoisted into standing position. He 
said the roof was made of wood and steel and reinforced with a three-inch slab 
of concrete for acoustical quality because the theater sits in the flight path 
of the Long Beach Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was said to be of top acoustical caliber and was a welcome addition 
to the music department, faculty members and campus workers said it and other 
buildings in the complex were plagued by leaking roofs. 
</P>
<P>
"As I understand it, we've had some leakage problems but nothing that would be 
indicative of a structural problem," Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no significant damage to other buildings in the office and theater 
complex, which were to be closed and inspected, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Although no one expected such a dramatic collapse, several campus officials 
heeded warning signs of falling plaster and groaning walls throughout the 
weekend and alerted campus police. A music professor and a pupil were 
practicing Sunday when they noticed cracks and decided to leave the building. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday night, sound engineer Martin Brenner was there with about five high 
school students when he noticed the cracks had spread. He sent the youngsters 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
A campus building superintendent who was dispatched to inspect the building 
Monday morning climbed onto the roof but left in a hurry when he heard more 
creaking. Technicians were called out and, within seconds, the roof came 
crashing down, pancaking two nine-foot Steinway grand pianos valued at $75,000 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse triggered the sprinkler system, which soaked several timpani, bass 
drums and other instruments stored offstage, campus President Curtis McCray 
said. 
</P>
<P>
McCray said the walls of the recital hall would be shored up so the debris 
could be removed and the building tested to determine the cause of the 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"Trucks rolls by, airplanes fly over. . . . I don't think the strains of 
Beethoven could have done this," McCray said. 
</P>
<P>
Campus officials were uncertain whether the building could be saved; some fire 
officials seemed certain it was a total loss. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wholesale," firefighter Vestermark said. "That building is going to the 
ground."

IMELDA MARCOS FOUND NOT GUILTY; 
</P>
<P>
PHILIPPINES: THE FORMER FIRST LADY'S LATE HUSBAND WAS THE CULPABLE PARTY, SOME 
JURORS FEEL. KHASHOGGI IS ALSO CLEARED.

<TEXT>
<P>
Former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos was acquitted Monday of all federal 
fraud and racketeering charges stemming from allegations that she helped loot 
her country. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors called the government's case inadequate, and some were apparently 
convinced that political factors influenced the prosecution. The case was tried 
"on the wrong side of the ocean," one said. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi businessman Adnan Khashoggi, a co-defendant on fraud and obstruction of 
justice charges, also was acquitted on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
A courtroom packed with Marcos loyalists erupted in cheers and tears as the 
three-month trial of the dictator's widow came to a dramatic end on her 61st 
birthday. She stood crying as the jury forewoman answered "not guilty" to each 
of the four counts. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Marcos said that she was grateful to the American jury system "for my 
vindication." She left immediately for St. Patrick's Cathedral, where she 
walked on her knees down the center aisle to the altar, bowed her head to the 
floor and prayed. 
</P>
<P>
She had hoped that the verdict also would indicate vindication of her late 
husband, ousted Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
But some members of the jury told reporters after the verdict was announced 
that there was little sympathy for the former Philippine dictator in the jury 
room. 
</P>
<P>
"If Ferdinand Marcos was present in this trial, the jury would have convicted 
him," said juror Theodore Kutzy. And juror Sandra Albert, a paralegal, said 
that the government "had nothing on her and everything on her husband. He 
should have been the one on trial." 
</P>
<P>
The former President, who was accused of looting his nation and indicted along 
with his wife in 1988, died last fall. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Philippine government expressed regret about the verdict 
but said the trial had "clearly established before the world . . . what the 
Marcos regime was all about -- unbridled corruption and total abuse of power." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Mrs. Marcos' innocent verdict came as a blow to the U.S. and Philippine 
governments, which had worked closely in prosecuting the unprecedented case. 
Her acquittal also posed potentially serious political difficulties for the 
Administration of President Corazon Aquino. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately there were calls from Marcos supporters -- even in the courthouse 
hallways -- to let her return to the Philippines to bury her dead husband who 
lies entombed in Hawaii. However, the Philippine government said that she would 
not be allowed to return. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Aquino's Presidential Commission on Good Government, created to help 
track down billions of dollars in wealth believed stolen from the Philippines 
by Marcos, worked on the federal prosecution as legal advisers, auditors and 
liaison with the Manila government. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Marcos still faces a number of major court challenges, including the 
massive civil suit filed by the Philippine government in Los Angeles federal 
court. That suit, which was expected to go to trial as soon as the criminal 
case ended, seeks to recover some of the estimated $5 billion that the Manila 
government claims was looted from its treasury by the Marcos regime. 
</P>
<P>
Additional civil suits involving Mrs. Marcos and Philippine efforts to recover 
assets also are pending in New York and Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys criticized the criminal case as "a political prosecution." 
Gerry Spence, an attorney for Mrs. Marcos, said the Justice Department pressed 
the criminal charges to curry favor with the Manila government to protect the 
U.S. interest in military bases there. 
</P>
<P>
He argued before jurors that Aquino may have forced the indictment by 
insisting: "No prosecution, no bases." 
</P>
<P>
Such claims seemed to trouble some members of the jury panel, which was 
composed of seven women and five men. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not big brothers to people overseas," said juror Thomas O'Rourke. He 
said the case was tried "on the wrong side of the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
Several jurors said they thought the case should have been dropped after Marcos 
became ill and died. 
</P>
<P>
"They have made his poor wife miserable," said O'Rourke, expressing a degree of 
sympathy that turned out to be common among the panel. 
</P>
<P>
The Marcos and Khashoggi verdicts came during the fifth day of jury 
deliberations, shortly after Mrs. Marcos returned from noon Mass at the nearby 
St. Andrew's Catholic Church, where she had prayed daily since the jury began 
considering her case. 
</P>
<P>
Two of her children, Ferdinand Jr. (Bongbong) and Irene Araneta, sat in the 
audience surrounded by well-wishers. They were instantly wrapped in joyful 
embraces when the first "not guilty" was read. 
</P>
<P>
As the jury filed out, the audience began to cheer again despite Judge John 
Keenan's admonitions not to demonstrate. And the chamber burst into 
unrestrained applause when defense attorney Spence raised both arms high over 
his head in a triumphant salute to the departing jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Marcos, whose health had been a source of constant concern to Keenan, was 
ushered into a back room where she conferred privately with family members, 
close aides and her attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Then Mrs. Marcos descended the courthouse steps for the last time, saying: 
</P>
<P>
"A great burden is lifted. I'm glad it's over . . . God bless America." 
</P>
<P>
A beaming Khashoggi, surrounded by many members of his family, close friends 
and aides, walked from the courthouse clutching the Koran. 
</P>
<P>
The prominent financier, a key figure three years ago in the controversial 
White House arms initiative with Iran, said he will return to his native Saudi 
Arabia in a few days to join the holy pilgrimage to Mecca. 
</P>
<P>
"I have now permission to go and give my respects to my country, my God and my 
king," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lead prosecutor Charles LaBella, who had directed the Marcos investigation 
since its earliest days in 1987, declined to discuss the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
One clear failing of the government's case was its inability to satisfy the 
jury that Mrs. Marcos was directly involved in the graft and corruption 
committed by her husband and the business associates who claimed to represent 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The central allegation of the racketeering charges was that Mrs. Marcos used 
stolen funds to purchase art, jewelry and Manhattan real estate. She and 
Khashoggi were also accused of attempting to hide ownership of the New York 
buildings and some paintings after a court order in a civil lawsuit filed by 
the Aquino government froze all Marcos assets. 
</P>
<P>
Not one witness testified directly that Mrs. Marcos engaged in coercion, 
bribery and kickback schemes. Nor was the jury persuaded by government 
arguments that Mrs. Marcos "had to know" the vast amounts of money she was 
spending on art, jewels and real estate came from corrupt sources. That 
evidence was almost exclusively circumstantial. 
</P>
<P>
Spence conceded that Mrs. Marcos was "a world-class shopper," but he said she 
did not know the sources of her husband's wealth. 
</P>
<P>
The trial was an emotional and physical ordeal for the former Philippine first 
lady. 
</P>
<P>
Through more than 10 weeks of testimony from 95 witnesses the most intimate 
details of her personal and financial affairs were explored before a packed 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Former friends and close associates testified about the graft and corruption of 
the Marcos regime, about siphoning money for the couple's personal use from 
such sources as Japanese war reparations payments and from the nation's food 
program. Bribery, kickback and coercion schemes were linked to her late husband 
with incontrovertible detail. 
</P>
<P>
Almost daily, documents were entered into the voluminous public record showing 
how much she spent on jewelry, facials, sun glasses and special "soft toilet 
paper" for the President. 
</P>
<P>
One New York newspaper published a daily picture of the shoes she wore to 
court. 
</P>
<P>
As the trial neared its end she confided to friends that it was the most 
humiliating experience of her life. 
</P>
<P>
The stress began to show physically about midway into the government's case. 
Suitcases filled with jewelry and business documents and cartons filled with 
millions of dollars in freshly minted Philippine pesos were stacked in the 
courtroom as a U.S. customs agent described what the Marcoses brought with them 
into exile in Hawaii in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
She started crying after the agent described finding 24 bricks of gold (valued 
at about $300,000 today) in a case inscribed: "To my husband on our 24th 
wedding anniversary." 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, with the jury excused, Mrs. Marcos broke into loud sobs and had 
to be escorted to the courthouse nursing chamber when her blood pressure 
soared. 
</P>
<P>
For several weeks thereafter Mrs. Marcos wore a portable blood pressure monitor 
strapped to her arm that buzzed loudly whenever her blood pressure climbed. 
</P>
<P>
Twice the trial had to be interrupted because her blood pressure rose to what 
her doctors regarded as dangerous levels. Then late in May, she coughed up 
blood and fainted on the defense table as jurors gasped. 
</P>
<P>
When the trial resumed after a week's delay, her private physician with a 
portable oxygen tank and other emergency medical supplies was given a front row 
seat just outside the court railing. 
</P>
<P>
Dissension among her defense team reportedly contributed to the stress. But 
there were no outward signs of dissension among the lawyers Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Spence, a noted Wyoming defense attorney, lauded the jury, calling it a "jewel 
of the American justice system."

Daily Inquirer, Times staff writer Jim Mann and intern Tien Lee.

FATHER OF INMATE KILLED ON FIRE LINES SAYS SON SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AT SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The distraught father of an inmate killed last week while fighting a Riverside 
County blaze said Monday he does not understand why his son was at the scene in 
the first place and demanded efforts by the state "to make sure this doesn't 
happen again." 
</P>
<P>
Victor Ferrera, 22, was one of two people killed in last week's rash of 
Southern California fires. Fifteen fellow inmate-firefighters from the Bautista 
state correctional camp in Hemet and a state fire supervisor were also injured, 
three of them seriously, when a sudden change in winds trapped them briefly in 
a sea of fire about 20 miles from their Riverside camp. 
</P>
<P>
State forestry and corrections officials said the Riverside accident -- 
responsible for more injuries than any of the other fires last week -- is under 
investigation, with a full report expected this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Why did they send those guys up there, with little shovels and those big 
flames, and tell these kids to put out the fire?" asked Jim Ferrera, the 
victim's father. "There are no dwellings there, nothing to save." 
</P>
<P>
But state officials defended the program that now allows 3,600 low-risk inmates 
around California to volunteer for firefighting duty at $1 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
"This program is one of the most effective we have," said Christine May, a 
spokeswoman for the state Department of Corrections in Sacramento. "The inmates 
are well trained and well supervised, and they do work that would normally cost 
local governments far more than the cost of the program." 
</P>
<P>
Ferrera was the second inmate to die fighting a fire since the program was 
instituted in 1946, state officials said. Another inmate died battling a blaze 
near Big Sur last year, they said. Inmates who volunteer for the program must 
take two weeks of basic firefighting training, and receive one day off their 
sentences for each day spent on the fire lines or engaged in other conservation 
work. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Ferrera, who lives in Fullerton and works at the Long Beach-Los Angeles 
harbor, said he is not convinced that the program provides adequate training 
and supervision for the inmates. He and his attorney said they are considering 
a wrongful-death action against the state. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Ferrera is to be buried today. Flags at state corrections conservation 
camps will be flown at half staff, but his father said the family declined an 
offer by the state to escort them to a memorial service at the Bautista camp, 
where Victor Ferrera had been held since last year after a parole violation. He 
was scheduled for release in four months. 
</P>
<P>
According to state corrections officials, he was initially incarcerated in 1988 
for assault with a deadly weapon after he tried to steal a car from its driver 
at knifepoint. 
</P>
<P>
On the state's offer, Ferrera said: "I don't want that. It just didn't set 
right with me. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a good kid," Ferrera added in a brief telephone interview. "My family's 
pretty well shook up. We're going through hell right now, and I don't imagine 
we'll ever get over it." 
</P>
<P>
State officials said the Ferreras will be eligible for financial compensation 
to cover the cost of the funeral.

With legislators and the governor making no progress toward closing the state's 
$3.6-billion budget gap, Controller Gray Davis said Monday that about $114 
million in Medi-Cal payments have been stalled because the state's 
check-writers lack the legal authority to pay the bills. 
</P>
<P>
Davis also said the state, as of Monday, had spent $2.2 billion more than it 
took in during the 1989-1990 fiscal year. He predicted that when all the bills 
are paid and all the checks are counted, the government will finish the year 
with a deficit -- perhaps as high as $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
An emergency funding bill passed by the Legislature last week and signed Monday 
by Gov. George Deukmejian will allow the state to issue checks for renters' tax 
credits and pay other bills that had been delayed. But Davis said the measure 
will not resolve the Medi-Cal problem because state law does not allow the 
controller to charge those payments back to the last fiscal year, which ended 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the doctors, hospitals and nursing homes that care for 
California's poor will not be paid until a new budget is enacted. That could be 
days or even weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The delay is forcing hospitals throughout California to borrow money to tide 
them over until the Medi-Cal payments arrive. Lori Aldrete, a spokeswoman for 
the California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems, said the blow is 
particularly hard for the hospitals to absorb because the state pays them an 
average of only 61 cents on the dollar for the care they render to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a double-whammy," Aldrete said. "It's a very bad situation for the 
hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian Administration officials, however, disputed the controller's 
assessment on the Medi-Cal issue and said he was exaggerating the problems with 
the state's overall fiscal health. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Director Jesse R. Huff said the Administration believes the stop-gap 
bill Deukmejian signed Monday gives Davis all the authority he needs to pay the 
Medi-Cal providers. Huff added that the Legislature may soon pass another bill 
to straighten out the confusion. 
</P>
<P>
"Our view of life is that the bills should be paid and he could pay them," Huff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Huff accused Davis of trying to "confuse people" with his comments on the 
possibility of a deficit. Two years ago, Davis, a Democrat, and several other 
official state sources said Republican Deukmejian had ended the year in the 
red, but Deukmejian insisted that the year had ended with a small surplus. It 
appears that deficit dance might be repeated this year. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be in the black," Huff said, adding: "Not by very much." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who once was chief of staff to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., seemed 
to take delight in dissecting Deukmejian's fiscal difficulties. Deukmejian, 
referring to the financial crisis Brown handed to him when he took office in 
1983, has often said that he took the state from "IOU to A-OK." 
</P>
<P>
Standing in the office where his employees cut the checks to the people owed 
money by the state, Davis said the state is "definitely not A-OK. Financially 
speaking, we are rapidly approaching the 'ICU' -- intensive care unit." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the state has "nothing left in its checking account." He said he is 
borrowing from special funds, such as the Highway Trust Account, to pay some 
bills. Without a new budget, he said, those funds will be exhausted around July 
27 and he will be forced to issue warrants -- IOUs -- redeemable at a later 
date. 
</P>
<P>
The two-house conference committee drafting a $56-billion budget for the 
1990-91 fiscal year recessed Monday after coming up $2.9 billion short of what 
it will take to produce a balanced spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
"We have made virtually no progress," said Assemblyman William P. Baker 
(R-Danville). 
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the committee, Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-San Jose), 
brushed off criticism from Republicans who said Democrats are too unwilling to 
cut deeply into state services. He said the proposed budget, even though it 
contains a deficit, is "more responsible than cutting people's food supply, or 
health supply, or education supply." 
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, about 100 disabled demonstrators crowded into Deukmejian's 
office and tried to chain their wheelchairs together to protest proposed budget 
cuts. One of the governor's cuts is $5.5 million for Independent Living 
Centers, a program that helps the disabled prepare for entering "mainstream" 
society. 
</P>
<P>
State police with bolt cutters prevented the demonstrators from forming a 
barrier to Deukmejian's office. Four protesters were arrested and cited for 
blocking a public building. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Dardick, president of the Coalition to Save Independent Living Centers, 
said the proposed budget cutback could close 28 of the centers.

BILL WOULD REVERSE RULING ON MENTALLY ILL; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: PATIENTS WHO ARE CONFINED AGAINST THEIR WILL WOULD LOSE THE RIGHT TO 
REFUSE CERTAIN DRUGS PRESCRIBED BY THEIR PSYCHIATRISTS. THE MEASURE HAS PASSED 
THE SENATE AND IS PENDING IN THE ASSEMBLY.

<P>
State lawmakers are close to overturning a landmark court decision that gave 
mentally ill patients confined against their will the right to refuse 
antipsychotic drugs ordered by their psychiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
The court decision required psychiatrists to receive the informed consent of 
their patients before medicating them. Except in an emergency, doctors must 
obtain a judge's order declaring the patient incompetent to participate in his 
own medical decisions. 
</P>
<P>
But legislation that has cleared the Senate and is pending in the Assembly 
would require only a second opinion from a fellow doctor before psychiatrists 
could force the drugs on their patients. 
</P>
<P>
The measure is sponsored by the California Alliance for the Mentally Ill, a 
group representing families of the mentally ill. Alliance members, backed by 
psychiatrists and mental hospitals, say that many patients will be left in 
shackles or returned to the streets untreated if their doctors cannot medicate 
them immediately. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents, including advocates for former patients who say they were 
drugged unnecessarily, contend that the court decision has prompted a healthy 
change in the way psychiatrists relate to their patients. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is a 1987 appellate court decision that was made final by the state 
Supreme Court last year. 
</P>
<P>
The case stemmed from the experience of Eleanor Riese, a Bay Area woman who, 
suffering from chronic schizophrenia, admitted herself to St. Mary's Hospital 
and Medical Center in San Francisco in 1985 and agreed to take antipsychotic 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
After several days in the hospital, Riese complained about the effect of the 
drugs and refused to take any more. At that point, five hospital staff members 
held her down while she was injected with the drug Mellaril. Riese was then 
declared an involuntary patient and forced to take medication until she was 
discharged. 
</P>
<P>
Riese was the plaintiff in the successful class-action suit filed by patients' 
rights advocates in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Writing for the state Court of Appeal, Justice J. Anthony Kline said the 
forcible use of powerful mind-altering drugs involves "moral and ethical 
considerations" outside the purview of the medical profession. 
</P>
<P>
To exempt these decisions from outside review, Kline wrote, would "invest 
physicians with a degree of power over others that cannot be squared with the 
intent of our Legislature and with the great value our society places on the 
autonomy of the individual." 
</P>
<P>
Hospitals and psychiatrists predicted that the decision would cause chaos as 
patients engaged in a wholesale boycott of medication. But only a relative 
handful of patients around the state who otherwise would have been drugged 
against their will have objected and been found by the courts to be competent 
to resist the medication. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles County, of more than 10,000 people ordered held in mental 
hospitals since last August, only 233 have filed petitions objecting to their 
medications, according to the county's patients' rights office. Of those, 123 
were found to be competent to make their own decisions. The numbers are similar 
in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
But supporters and opponents of the Riese decision say that statistics alone do 
not tell the whole story. 
</P>
<P>
Grace McAndrews, executive director of the California Alliance for the Mentally 
Ill, said that, for the sake of due process, some patients who need medication 
but object to it are being restrained in seclusion while they await their 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
"What we are doing is condemning these people to a fate equally as awful or 
worse than what was occurring in the back wards of the state hospitals in the 
'40s and '50s," McAndrews said. "This is terrible. It is inhumane and cruel." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation, introduced by Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), would return 
to psychiatrists almost the same latitude to administer drugs as they had 
before the Riese decision. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would allow the forcible use of drugs whenever a second psychiatrist 
concurred that the patient lacked the capacity to make his own decisions. Even 
if the patient had the capacity, medication could still be administered if the 
person had been admitted to the hospital as a danger to himself or others. 
</P>
<P>
Patients who continued to resist drug treatment would be entitled to a judicial 
hearing but could be medicated in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, which passed the Senate on a 23-7 vote, is scheduled for a key 
hearing today in the Assembly Health Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Presley, the powerful chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and 
Assemblyman Bruce Bronzan (D-Fresno), head of the Health Committee, present a 
formidable team backing the bill. The Alliance for the Mentally Ill, whose 
members tell heart-rending stories about their family members' experiences, 
also carries great weight in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not trying to coerce," said Dan Weisburd, president of the Alliance, 
whose son has been in and out of 20 mental hospitals in the last 10 years. 
"What we are trying to do is rescue, to free from their psychosis people who 
are in desperate need." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents argue that the evidence suggests few patients in need of medication 
are being deprived. The vast majority either accept the drugs or are medicated 
without their consent in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision has not proven to be disruptive," said Robert Bunker, a San 
Francisco lawyer who represents patients. "Why gut it before it has had a 
chance to fulfill its promise?" 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles), the bill's chief opponent in the 
Legislature, said too many hospitals and doctors use drugs as a substitute for 
the time-consuming individual attention that their patients deserve. 
</P>
<P>
"What these hospitals are essentially telling us is that they can't afford to 
spend the time with the patient," Margolin said. "They want a quick-fix, 
rubber-stamp, involuntary medication procedure because they don't have the 
resources to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Patient advocates contend that the decision's greatest effect has been on those 
patients whose cases never reach the courts. To get their informed consent, 
doctors are talking to them and explaining the need for medication. When they 
leave the hospital, these advocates argue, the patients are more likely to 
continue treatment because they have participated in the decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"Before Riese, many involuntary patients came in and they were just zapped with 
medication," said Barbara Lurie, director of the patients' rights office in Los 
Angeles County. "Nobody really worked with them. Most patients are very savvy 
about their medication. They know which ones work and which ones don't. But 
often their preferences weren't even listened to." 
</P>
<P>
The proponents of the Presley bill acknowledge that there were occasional 
abuses before the Riese decision. But they say the pendulum now has swung too 
far in the other direction, taking too much authority away from the doctors who 
are closest to the patient. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the safeguards there to protect them," Weisburd said. "But the second 
opinion of a psychiatrist is better than the billable hours of an attorney."

Mentally Ill -- The Times in Tuesday's editions incorrectly reported the number 
of mentally ill patients in Los Angeles County who had been ruled competent to 
participate in their own medical care. According to the county Mental Health 
Department, 140 patients had court hearings after resisting antipsychotic drugs 
between August, 1989 and May, 1990, and 17 were found to have the capacity to 
make their own medical decisions.

SANTA BARBARA FIRE FLARES ANEW; 
</P>
<P>
SETBACK: AN UNEXPECTED RISE IN TEMPERATURES AND GUSTING WINDS HAMPER THE FIGHT 
TO CONTROL THE BLAZE. BUT FULL CONTROL IS STILL EXPECTED TODAY.

Firefighters, hampered by an unexpected rise in temperatures and gusting winds, 
suffered a setback Monday in combating the stubborn blaze that has blackened 
4,900 acres and destroyed more than 400 homes here, but said they still 
expected the fire to be under full control today. 
</P>
<P>
Aided by cool, moist ocean breezes over the weekend, firefighters were able to 
surround the fire. But early Monday morning 35-m.p.h. gusts flared up without 
warning and temperatures climbed into the 80s. 
</P>
<P>
"The crews are always dependent on the weather," U.S. Forest Service spokesman 
Maeton Freel said. "If the cooler weather had held, everything would have gone 
as planned. We'll still get control. It'll just take a little longer." 
</P>
<P>
The sudden change in conditions and drop in humidity "caused some edginess" 
among the fire crews because "they didn't expect it," said Santa Barbara County 
Fire Capt. Charles Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still confident about gaining control pretty soon," said Susan 
Mockenhaupt, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service. "The hot spots are 
within the fire perimeter . . . so everything still looks pretty good out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Damage from the fire was estimated by the U.S. Forest Service at about $500 
million. 
</P>
<P>
By Monday, more than 75 people had been cited for "sightseeing at the scene of 
an emergency," a misdemeanor, after they were caught combing though the rubble 
in burned-out neighborhoods, said Tim Gracey, spokesman for the Santa Barbara 
County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
Gracey said most of the homes were leveled by the fire, "so there's not a whole 
lot left to take. . . . But after losing a $500,000 house, the last thing I'd 
want is to find some yahoo looking through my rubble." 
</P>
<P>
The firefighters spent most of Monday battling two "stubborn hot spots," 
Mockenhaupt said, both in rugged terrain, several miles from residential areas. 
In addition to the ground crews, helicopters continued to drop water and fire 
retardant on smoldering areas. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night the fire was contained, which means a fire line around the 
blaze was completed. Control means that there are no flames within about 300 
feet of the fire lines. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in San Diego County, firefighters battling the Lake Henshaw blaze 
predicted it would be extinguished by 6 a.m. today. As of 1 p.m. Monday, it had 
been entirely contained and was 60% extinguished, said Audrey Hagan, 
spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry. Authorities believe the 
blaze, like the Santa Barbara fire, was set by an arsonist. Officials in both 
areas have offered rewards for any information leading to an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Just as firefighters were taming the Lake Henshaw fire that has raged since 
last Thursday, 330 of them were called out to battle a new fire just north of 
Lake Wohlford, east of Escondido. Hagan said the fire started at 2:45 p.m. and 
had engulfed 100 acres by 4:30 p.m.

THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT REVENGE IN TURIN; 
</P>
<P>
SOCCER: FANS REMEMBER 1985 RIOT IN BRUSSELS. MAYOR HAD ASKED TO HAVE 
ENGLAND-WEST GERMANY GAME MOVED TO NAPLES.

TURIN, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While attending the 1985 European Cup soccer final in Brussels, Dante Grassi 
witnessed one of sport's most tragic incidents. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-nine persons, all but seven of them Italian supporters of Juventus of 
Turin, were killed and hundreds injured in a riot that Belgium's courts ruled 
was instigated by England's Liverpool fans. 
</P>
<P>
Five years later, England's national team will play a World Cup semifinal 
Wednesday against West Germany in Turin's new Comunale Stadium, Juventus' home. 
</P>
<P>
Grassi, an architect who is the coordinator of Juventus' fan club, was asked 
Monday how he believes the members feel about the presence here of the English 
and their supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"Completely indifferent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone in Turin, a northern Italian city of 1.3 million, is reacting 
so complacently. Afraid that English fans again will start trouble in the 
stadium, Grassi's two young sons asked him not to attend the game. 
</P>
<P>
Some city government officials, however, are equally fearful of local agitators 
who have indicated a desire for revenge against the English for the deaths at 
Heyfel Stadium in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
Warnings have been spray-painted on stone walls in the city: "Hooligans Beware: 
We Have Not Forgotten Heyfel," and "Juventus Comrades, We Will Avenge You." 
</P>
<P>
Turin's mayor, Maria Magnani Noya, was concerned enough that she appealed 
through the media to FIFA, soccer's world governing body, and the Italia '90 
organizing committee to change the tournament draw so that the English would 
play their semifinal game against the West Germans in Naples. 
</P>
<P>
That is the site of the semifinal game today between Italy and Argentina. Noya 
preferred that game for Turin. 
</P>
<P>
In a television interview, she said: "The events involving hooligans in recent 
days show the danger linked to the presence of these characters in Turin . . . 
the memory of the tragedy of Heyfel which hit our city could aggravate the 
danger of the hooligans and unleash a mass reaction." 
</P>
<P>
La Republica, an Italian newspaper, quoted her as saying: "I am terrified. If 
FIFA does not do something, it will be war. Nobody here has forgotten Heyfel." 
She has since softened her position, but her concern is clear. 
</P>
<P>
A FIFA spokesman, Guido Tognoni, said Monday that the mayor had not contacted 
FIFA or the organizing committee. He said the sites for the semifinal games 
would have been switched if a request had been made by the police. 
</P>
<P>
"But the police felt there was no reason to intervene," he said. "Inside the 
stadium, we expect no problem whatsoever. Outside, we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Giuseppe Emilio, an aide to the city's police chief, said Monday that the focus 
of those involved in security -- about 6,000 local, state and military 
policemen -- has been on areas outside the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
He said he does not anticipate a repeat of the Heyfel Stadium tragedy or even 
of a 1980 incident in Turin involving English and Belgian fans. A European 
Championship game between their teams was interrupted when police broke up 
fighting in the stands with tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
There have been no significant disturbances inside stadiums during the World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Emilio said that police were aware of a meeting between some supporters of 
Turin's two Italian League teams -- Juventus and Torino -- to plan attacks on 
English fans. But he downplayed the possibility of an organized assault, saying 
that the meeting was poorly attended. 
</P>
<P>
He said police believe the greatest potential for confrontation is during the 
hours immediately after tonight's Italy-Argentina game in Naples. 
</P>
<P>
Italian victories in the World Cup have led to spontaneous, raucous 
celebrations in the streets of cities throughout the country. If drunken 
Italian and English fans mix during such a celebration in Turin, Emilio said, 
violence could result. 
</P>
<P>
That was the case last week in the coastal resort of Rimini, where English and 
Italian fans clashed after Italy's 2-0 second-round victory over Uruguay in 
Rome. Police arrested 246 English fans, who were deported. 
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of a similar eruption here, government officials here and in 
surrounding towns have extended the ban on the sale of alcoholic beverages to 
48 hours to cover both days of the semifinals. The ban usually lasts 24 hours 
and applies only to the city in which a game is being played. 
</P>
<P>
Emilio said additional security will be employed around the parks that are 
serving as campsites for English fans who do not have hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we have anticipated all the problems," Emilio said. "We will use all 
measures at our disposal to guarantee order and security. Personally, I am not 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Except for the incident at Rimini, the Italian police have been able to control 
the small minority of English fans who came to create havoc. There were some 
arrests last month on Sardinia, where England played its first-round games, but 
the island did not turn into the battleground that was expected. 
</P>
<P>
Tognoni was quoted in a London newspaper as saying that FIFA officials would 
meet after the tournament to consider whether England should be banned from the 
1994 World Cup in the United States because of its fans' behavior, but he later 
said he was misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
Other FIFA officials said they are not as irritated by the English fans as they 
are by the security measures that seem necessary whenever they are present. 
</P>
<P>
With a security force of 5,000, there were no incidents last weekend in Naples, 
where the English beat Cameroon Sunday in a quarterfinal game, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
"All was quiet in Naples," said Kay Coombs, a spokeswoman for the British 
embassy. "We expect the same in Turin." 
</P>
<P>
So much attention has been focused on English and Juventus fans that it has 
virtually been forgotten that the most damaging incident at the World Cup was 
instigated by West German supporters June 10 in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that an estimated 1,000 drunken West Germans were involved in 
rioting as they chased Yugoslav fans through the street near the Gothic 
Cathedral and the luxury shopping district. Forty-three West Germans were 
deported, including two who were sentenced to a year in jail upon returning 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"The organizers here are as much afraid of the Germans as they are the 
English," Grassi said. "We are all afraid of what will happen when they meet."

NBC said Monday that it will not bid for U.S. television rights for the 1994 
World Cup, the first world soccer championship to be played in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Ebersol, president of NBC Sports, also predicted that ABC and CBS would 
decline to bid for rights to the monthlong tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the ratings, I don't think anyone will go for it," Ebersol said while at 
Wimbledon to watch the tennis championships. 
</P>
<P>
Turner Broadcasting's TNT cable network is showing this year's World Cup in the 
United States. Fewer than 2% of U.S. viewers who receive the network watched 
the three games involving the United States, which played in the World Cup for 
the first time in 40 years. 
</P>

Turner, televising the World Cup for the first time, paid about $7.5 million 
for U.S. broadcast rights and said it will evaluate the final ratings before 
deciding whether to bid for the 1994 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
NBC and the U.S. Soccer Federation last year agreed to a contract for the 1994 
tournament, but the contract was rejected by FIFA because it was tied to a deal 
for rights to exhibition games involving the U.S. team. FIFA has said it will 
entertain bids for U.S. rights later this year. Since then, NBC agreed to a 
four-year deal with the NBA that begins this fall.

U.S. CUTS THE FIELD AND COSTS FOR AMERICA'S CUP 
</P>

<P>
The five syndicates eliminated last Friday from consideration for the America's 
Cup trials probably don't realize what a favor was done them by San Diego's 
America's Cup Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, the act smacked of the arrogance of the old days, when the New 
York Yacht Club was running the Cup. After watching the potential defenders 
sail a few races among themselves, the race committee, wearing traditional blue 
blazers, straw hats and red pants, would cruise over and politely inform a 
luckless skipper that he was excused from further competition. 
</P>
<P>
The late Tom Blackaller, who was inevitably excused, railed at the system, 
which was scrapped when the Royal Perth Yacht Club, as host of the 1986-87 
defense for Australia, switched to the innovative method of picking the 
survivors on victories and defeats. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Yacht Club never thought of that. 
</P>
<P>
The ACOC, which is managing the 1992 defense for the San Diego Yacht Club, 
simply refined the New York system by excusing apparent non-contenders before 
they could waste money they didn't have building boats they wouldn't sail as 
well as some others in the fight. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not the old straw hats, red pants routine," said Tom Ehman, the ACOC 
chief. "This is a much sounder process. We've borrowed a page from both New 
York and Royal Perth." 
</P>
<P>
Ehman said he talked to Stan Reid, who was commodore of the Royal Perth during 
the '86-87 defense. 
</P>
<P>
"Stan said, 'You have significantly strengthened your defense. We should have 
done the same. And you've done the (five) a favor.' " 
</P>
<P>
Reid always felt that Australia's cause was hurt by allowing too many weak 
syndicates to clutter up the defense program for too long, diluting the 
competition and available sponsorship funds. 
</P>
<P>
Of the five excused syndicates -- Advance America, Betsy Ross, Christina, U.S. 
Women's and Yankee -- only two were able to meet the deadline for posting a 
$150,000 performance bond for programs that will cost about $15 million each. 
They also were asked to show evidence that they could raise $6 million to build 
boats by the end of the year. Some still lacked design plans or sailing 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
"But in the financial area, none of them had developed the $6 million 
capability," Ehman said. 
</P>
<P>
Ehman added: "I hope you'll print that each of the five was serious and spent a 
lot of time trying to make it happen. There weren't any T-shirt salesmen or 
shoe clerks." 
</P>
<P>
The four syndicates remaining -- Team Dennis Conner, (Peter) Isler Sailing 
International, Larry Klein's Triumph America and Beach Boys America -- will 
continue to share in the Partnership for America's Cup Technology (PACT) to cut 
costs for all by pooling research and design -- up to a point. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Ives, long a respected international racing judge, now merits respect as a 
sailor, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Ives, of Long Beach, swept the field in the recent Audi/North Sails Race Week. 
</P>
<P>
Sailing Ravage, his modified Newport 30 turned 33, he won Class G, along with 
the Quattro Trophy for winning the most competitive class, the Lydia Kent 
Trophy for the best family-sailed boat (minimum of three members) and led the 
Long Beach Yacht Club to the three-boat team trophy. 
</P>
<P>
Sailing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Ulander, 20, of Costa Mesa, has been added to the U.S. sailing team in 
the Olympic Yachting Committee's program designed to fund and train the top 
five sailors in each class for the '92 Games at Barcelona. Ulander, a graduate 
of Newport Harbor High School who attends Connecticut College, won the spot 
recently by placing third in the new Europe dinghy class of the U.S. women's 
single-handed championships at Marblehead, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Although the America's Cup Organizing Committee has eliminated both women's 
syndicates from the defense competition, J.J. Isler says there are some 
individuals who would qualify as crew members. She is one, of course, but is 
going to concentrate on another Olympic campaign for '92. Two women who should 
be considered are Martha McKechnie, a regular in major events, and Dory Vogel, 
who was Isler's backup navigator with Dennis Conner in '87. There will be a 
crew weight limit of about 195 pounds a person in the new America's Cup class. 
"The teams are going to have to go with smaller people (to bring the average 
down)," Isler said. "The grinders will be bigger than that." 
</P>
<P>
The Cabrillo Beach Yacht Club will hold the CBYC-Texaco Starport Regatta July 
14-15, with five races in one-design and three PHRF classes. . . . John 
MacLaurin of Los Angeles, second and first in the first two Ultimate series pro 
events at Hawaii and San Francisco, will compete next at Corpus Christi, Tex., 
this weekend. . . . An exhibit of Geri Conser's sailboat racing photography is 
being featured at the Maritime Museum in San Pedro through Sept. 30.

CHALLENGE TO GORBACHEV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's comrades in the Communist Party are expected 
to submit his five-year record as Soviet leader to days of bruising criticism 
as a national party congress charts the future of both the party and society at 
a time of plummeting economic performance and spreading discontent. 
</P>
<P>
The congress has the power to name the party leadership, and conservatives may 
nominate their own candidate to challenge Gorbachev, the party's general 
secretary since 1985. He has made it clear that he wants to retain the No. 1 
party job along with the Soviet presidency. 
</P>
<P>
The congress, the first since 1986, will also debate to what degree the 
Communist Party should democratize its internal procedures.

MORE AID FOR EASTERN EUROPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foreign ministers of 24 of the world's richest nations are expected to expand 
their program of economic aid for the democratizing regimes of eastern Europe 
during a meeting on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Originally, the so-called Group of 24 -- including the nations of Western 
Europe plus Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Canada, and the United States -- 
planned to assist only Hungary and Poland. But now Czechoslovakia almost 
certainly will be added to the list, and Romania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia may 
also get help. 
</P>
<P>
East Germany, now under Bonn's economic wing, will not figure in the talks. But 
Western aid for Moscow -- advocated by France and West Germany while so far 
opposed in Washington -- may come up.

PAST THE INTIFADA: AREA FOCUS SHIFTS; 
</P>
<P>
WARLIKE RHETORIC, A REGIONAL ARMS BUILDUP AND A NEW SURGE IN ISLAMIC 
FUNDAMENTALISM HAVE BROUGHT THE MIDDLE EAST SITUATION FULL CIRCLE.

NABLUS, Israeli-Occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a rough stone wall in the old market area of Nablus, someone has scrawled 
the invitation, "Welcome, Saddam Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
No one expects the bellicose leader from Iraq to come soon, if ever. But the 
small message underscores an accelerating change of focus in the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. After more than two years of holding center stage 
in the Middle East, the Palestinian uprising is giving way to fast-moving 
events in the outside Arab world. At the same time, Palestinians are wondering 
whether the revolt may have reached the limit of its ability to move events. 
</P>
<P>
Besides warlike rhetoric, a regional Arab arms buildup and a new surge of 
Islamic fundamentalism have helped shift attention away from the continuing 
struggle over the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, the change brings the Middle East situation full circle. The 
intifada was considered a turning point precisely because it redefined what had 
long been termed the Arab-Israeli conflict. When Palestinians in the 
territories rose up starting in December, 1987, their action served to refocus 
the debate on its original, Palestinian-Israeli dimension. 
</P>
<P>
Returning to the more diffuse "Arab world versus Israel" context has 
implications for all the players. 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government is urging Palestinians to take the opportunity to 
discuss its offer of limited self-rule and not hitch their aspirations to 
pan-Arab militancy or the Palestine Liberation Organization, which Israel views 
as an outside force. 
</P>
<P>
For the United States, the change in focus challenges its policy of 
concentrating on first resolving the Palestinian issue as a step to wider 
regional stability. Should the old quest for a comprehensive, multi-partner 
peace effort be revived, with the Palestinians merely a part of a larger 
constellation? 
</P>
<P>
Palestinians, meanwhile, are just beginning to feel the new climate and are 
undecided on what to do. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a certain diffusion of interest in the current stalemated situation," 
said Sari Nusseibeh, a public spokesman for the intifada. "There is a lack of 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
"We are at a stalemate. Our activities have not been exploited properly to 
bring peace," added Said Kanaan, a prominent PLO contact in Nablus. 
</P>
<P>
There is heated discussion on which way to go with the revolt in order to 
regain the initiative. Palestinians speak of taking up arms, although they are 
not likely to have enough to dent the overwhelming strength of the Israeli 
army. Meanwhile, small-scale terror attacks have become more numerous, 
including a series of pipe bombings in Jerusalem. In one incident, three 
bystanders at a bus stop were lightly wounded. 
</P>
<P>
"The talk about escalation is an expression of pure anger," commented 
Nusseibeh. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the spectrum, public leaders speak of setting up a 
provisional Palestinian government in the territories in order to organize 
peaceful protest and funnel resources to activists. But the effort runs against 
the trend toward fragmentation of the revolt. 
</P>
<P>
Not only do PLO factions vie for support from the mother organization, but the 
PLO is at odds with groups outside its control in the West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
In Nablus, considered one of the core cities of the intifada, a factional 
dispute between Fatah, the main PLO faction, and Hamas, a Muslim group opposed 
to the PLO's dominance, recently burst into the open. Fatah activists 
circulated a leaflet implying that a Hamas official is homosexual. In 
retaliation, two Hamas militants raided a house, stabbing and badly wounding 
two Fatah supporters who were asleep inside. 
</P>
<P>
Both Palestinian views of what to do next are aimed at breathing life into the 
intifada, which sometimes appears to be running on automatic pilot. The 
throwing of stones is still its main expression, but other modes of rebellion 
compete, sometimes at cross-purposes. The unabated killing of collaborators, 
for instance, contrasts with leadership pleas for peaceful civil disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
It is not only the ebb and flow of the always loosely run uprising that has 
changed, but its international context. 
</P>
<P>
When the intifada began nearly 31 months ago, the wider Arab-Israeli conflict 
appeared to be on hold. Israel's main enemies were occupied elsewhere or were 
recovering from the fatigue of other wars. 
</P>
<P>
The bloody conflict between Iraq and Iran was just ending. Syria was tied up in 
Lebanon. Jordan, never the most independently aggressive of Israel's 
adversaries, was eager to court the Western world. It was one of several Arab 
states that appeared to be willing to live with Israel once some breakthrough 
toward peace could be made. Egypt maintained its decade-old peace treaty with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an illusion created that nothing was going on in the Arab world. No 
one paid attention to military buildups. Everything was focused on the 
intifada," said Dore Gold, an analyst at the Jaffee Center for Strategic 
Studies in Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
That all has changed. A massive wave of immigration from the Soviet Union to 
Israel is building and, in the Arab view, can only mean fuel for what they see 
as Israeli expansionism. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir only encouraged their 
concerns by proclaiming that a big immigration required a big Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of the Soviet Bloc in Eastern Europe marked the end of moral and 
military support for Arab nations at odds with the United States and Israel, so 
they have begun to draw together in a renewal of defunct alliances. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan's King Hussein appears especially nervous over right-wing rumblings from 
Israel that he should be overthrown and his country, which already has a 
Palestinian majority, turned into the much-discussed Palestinian state. The 
monarch has turned to Iraq for backing. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, fundamentalist Muslims made strong electoral showings in Jordan and 
Algeria, offering a source of inspiration to Palestinian Islamic movements 
already competing with the PLO for leadership in the West Bank and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a sense that the world is collapsing beneath the feet of the Arabs," 
said Mark Heller, an analyst at the Jaffee Center. 
</P>
<P>
The surge in fundamentalist politics is a particular wild card, Heller added. 
"There is some question whether the fundamentalists calculate the costs and 
risks of their actions," he said, noting Iran's unpredictable course. 
</P>
<P>
Into this climate of nervousness steps Saddam Hussein. This spring he turned 
heads by threatening to wipe out half of Israel if Israel attacked him, and he 
revealed a store of chemical weapons. Indications are that he is searching for 
a variety of means to deliver them -- rockets, jets, cannons. 
</P>
<P>
In his bid for Arab world leadership, Saddam Hussein is well placed. He came 
out of the war against Iran with the region's biggest army and has oil revenue 
to sustain it. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO, having failed to get peace talks with Israel under way and now once 
more cut off from dialogue with the United States, has sidled up to Iraq. 
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza have begun to cry for help from Arab 
governments, even to the point of invasion. Palestinians praise efforts by PLO 
guerrillas to attack Israel by sea, even though the attacks have historically 
produced little but bad publicity for the Palestinian cause. Psychologically, 
at least, this suggests a change from the go-it-alone Palestinian attitude that 
was so strongly reinforced in the early months of the intifada; a change back 
to relying more on the outside Arab world as their only hope. 
</P>
<P>
Israel responds by reminding Saddam Hussein that it can defend itself and by 
trying to direct its diplomacy -- and that of its main ally, the United States 
-- away from the present Palestinian issue and toward resolving the looming 
conflict with the Arab world. In a letter to President Bush last week, Shamir 
pointed to the hostile Arab world as Israel's main preoccupation, not the 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
"Israel has always said the real danger is from the Arab states," said analyst 
Heller. "It wants to be reassured by the Arab world that there will be peace 
before dealing with the Palestinians." 
</P>
<P>
Which way will the United States direct its efforts? The Bush Administration 
has been trying to remove the Palestinian-Israeli conflict from the broader 
Middle East equation. It has repeatedly -- but unsuccessfully -- pressed Shamir 
to take steps toward peace talks with Palestinians as a first move toward 
reducing regional tensions. 
</P>
<P>
Some Israeli analysts wonder if now is not the time for Washington to try a 
dual approach: Continue to press Shamir to take up talks with Palestinians, but 
also open avenues with the Arabs over urgent issues, notably arms control. 
</P>
<P>
The goal would be to keep events from getting unintentionally out of hand. 
"There is danger in miscalculations and misperceptions in this kind of heated 
climate," Heller notes. 
</P>
<P>
Concluded Sari Nusseibeh: "Sometimes an atmosphere of danger can be created and 
leaders can become captive of it. And war can be the result."

THE CHANGING FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not only are families becoming smaller in the world's developed countries -- 
the traditional "nuclear family," with husband, wife and children forming the 
typical household, is changing. Scandinavian countries are the pacesetters in 
adopting non-traditional forms of households, especially with their relatively 
high numbers of births outside of wedlock and cohabitation outside of legal 
marriage. Japan is the most traditional. But the United States has the highest 
incidence of divorce and single-parent households. 
</P>
<P>
In the Face of Declining Birth Rates...Births to Unmarried Women on the Rise 
</P>
<P>
Birth rates throughout the industrialized world have trended steadily downward. 
But births to unmarried women are on the rise. In the U.S. and Britain, about 
one-third of such births are to teen-agers, while in Sweden half are to women 
aged 25-34.

What Makes a Household? The Rules are Changing 
</P>
<P>
Households consisting of a married couple, with or without children, still 
predominate. But their share of the total is in steady decline everywhere 
except Japan. 
</P>
<P>
* The one-person household has become the fastest growing household type except 
in Japan, where nearly two-thirds of the elderly still live with their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
* Unmarried couples living together as a percentage of all couples living 
together grew in the United States from 1.2% in 1970 to nearly 5% by 1988. 
</P>
<P>
* So-called "consensual unions" of unmarried couples are higher in Canada and 
most of Europe than in the U.S., and in Sweden and Denmark they represent about 
20% of all cohabiting couples 
</P>
<P>
* Sweden has the oldest population among 10 industrialized nations studied, 
with 17.7% aged 65 years and over; the United States has the youngest 
population, with 21.8% under age 14.

HOW MANDELA'S TOUR IS PLAYING IN SOUTH AFRICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT and MORNA CORNELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nelson Mandela's trip to the United States, where he argued successfully for 
maintenance of sanctions against South Africa and collected more than $6 
million for the African National Congress' fight against apartheid, generated 
plenty of discussion -- both favorable and critical -- in an array of 
newspapers back home. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the country's largest-circulation daily newspapers are in Johannesburg 
-- the Star, which strongly supports reform but opposes the ANC position on 
sanctions and the armed liberation struggle, and the Citizen, a conservative 
paper that supports the government. 
</P>
<P>
The Star and the Citizen traded editorials on everything from Winnie Mandela's 
warm reception by American civil rights leaders to Nelson Mandela's support for 
Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat and Libyan leader 
Moammar Kadafi. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 In an editorial headlined "The View From The ANC's Side" on June 25, the Star 
said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Perspective plays curious tricks. This newspaper has criticized Mr. Mandela 
for demanding sustained sanctions; it has argued that the move from apartheid 
is irreversible and has felt something of the irritation displayed by 
government at what seems to be foot dragging by the ANC. But it is important to 
note that ANC leaders are not simply being bloody minded. The view from their 
side of the fence is decidedly different -- and nervous whites ought to be 
aware that black politicians feel nervous too. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Apartheid, we have argued, is mortally wounded. But it is not yet dead. Like 
Dracula, it still needs that final stake. People are still being hounded 
because they are living in an area reserved for whites. . . . Race 
classification and discrimination are still facts of life. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"No wonder black liberationists nurse their fears. They know the pressures on 
President (Frederik W.) de Klerk not to give away ultimate white power will be 
enormous. 
</P>
<P>
"But of course there is no going back. Which brings the country to a great 
irony. Sanctions are harmful, undoubtedly. But the ANC determination to have 
sanctions sustained provides daily reminder of economic disaster ahead. And 
that "ghastly" alternative may just help the president to persuade most whites 
that reform cannot be resisted, no matter how vicious the far right gets." 
</P>
<P>
In a June 26 editorial headlined "Winnie," the Citizen said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Nelson Mandela, the ANC deputy president, never talks like a racist. He 
tries to reassure whites that they have a safe future if the ANC takes over. He 
never utters a word of recrimination about the past. He is, as we have said 
often enough, the bland face of the ANC, and to that extent he is persuasive 
overseas about the organization's intentions, even if he is not always 
convincing at home. 
</P>
<P>
"Not so smooth is his wife, Winnie. She of the highly controversial past has 
been a silent and dutiful wife since he was released. But now surprisingly, she 
has been allowed by her husband and ANC tacticians to address several rallies. 
</P>
<P>
"And the Winnie of old has come out from behind the mask of Winnie, the demure 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
"Last Thursday, at a Harlem rally, Mrs. Mandela told a crowd of . . . mostly 
black New Yorkers, 'We want to count on you . . . that if things go wrong on 
that negotiating table . . . we know you will be there with us when we go back 
to the bush to fight the white man.' 
</P>
<P>
" . . . What we find most deplorable is her reference to fighting the white 
man. Isn't that blatant racialism? 
</P>
<P>
"What would Mrs. Mandela think if the state president (de Klerk) said that if 
the negotiations went wrong he would fight the black man? 
</P>
<P>
"Are all whites bad? Are all blacks bad? We certainly don't think so . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We believe Mrs. Mandela should go back to being the silent wife. Making 
threats like the kind she made in New York is unbecoming and a great disservice 
to the cause Mr. Mandela represents." 
</P>
<P>
The Star, in a June 28 editorial titled simply, "Winnie:" 
</P>
<P>
 "Astute politician that he is, Nelson Mandela is pussyfooting his way through 
the media minefields of America, largely without mishap and seemingly oblivious 
to the series of background explosions detonated by wife Winnie. 
</P>
<P>
"In a renaissance of her old fiery ways, belying the demure image of recent 
months, Mrs. Mandela has taken to forceful, emotional oratory which evokes an 
enthusiastic response everywhere she goes. Trouble is, the louder the applause, 
the more she seemingly gets carried away by her own passion. As a result, her 
utterances become extravagant and putting it mildly, undiplomatic. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Mandela would do himself, the ANC and his country a service if he borrowed 
a phrase from his American hosts and advised his wife to cool it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In a June 29 editorial headlined "Amazing," the Citizen considers Mandela's 
hero's embrace in the United States: 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . Even allowing for the fact that America's mainly deprived blacks need 
to find a black man to hero worship, someone who reflects their own strivings, 
their own need for acknowledgement, their own frustrations, the adulation 
appears overdone. 
</P>
<P>
"Even allowing for the fact that American legislators want black votes and Mr. 
Mandela's visit to the U.S. gives them the opportunity to identify themselves 
with him, and through him with their own blacks, we cannot believe that Mr. 
Mandela deserves the heroic, almost godlike status with which he has been 
invested. 
</P>
<P>
"It is assumed, wrongly, that he was a prisoner of conscience, that he was 
thrown into jail by a white racist regime because he dared stand up, like 
Martin Luther King, to demand civil rights for the blacks, that he was kept in 
jail 27 years for his views rather than his actions. The fact of the matter is 
that he went to jail because . . . he planned to overthrow the state. 
</P>
<P>
"And the plan was not one of civil disobedience but of violence. Mr. Mandela 
therefore is not a Martin Luther King who preached nonviolence; he was a black 
revolutionary . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"That the American legislators can give Mr. Mandela an ovation suggests that 
they either do not know his or the ANC's background, or that it doesn't matter. 
. . . They have turned him into a star, in the Hollywood tradition, and star he 
will remain. Mr. Mandela has won the battle of sanctions, in Europe and the 
U.S., and he will continue to wield a tremendous influence over the decisions 
of foreign governments in the months to come. 
</P>
<P>
". . . When the heady days of hero worship are over, Mr. Mandela will have to 
get down to the less exultant process of negotiating, with others, the future 
of South Africa. The time then will not be for heroics but for hard, tough 
negotiations -- and Mr. Mandela, in that respect, will be a leader among other 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
"And there is nothing godlike about that."

Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani sent messages Monday to 98 world leaders 
thanking them for helping the victims of last month's earthquake -- but he left 
out the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government provided $760,000 in aid for the earthquake survivors, 
according to the State Department, with private American groups sending $4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Also missing from the list were Saudi Arabia and Iraq, both of which sent aid.

MEXICO ARRESTS 4 IN KILLING OF HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: THE LAWYER WAS SLAIN MAY 21. HER DEATH PROMPTED THE CREATION OF A 
NATIONAL PANEL TO PROBE ABUSES.

<P>
Two former state police officers and two other alleged gunmen have been 
arrested for the murder of a prominent human rights activist whose death 
brought Mexico international condemnation, Sinaloa state officials announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects gunned down Norma Corona Sapien, a lawyer and president of the 
independent Human Right Commission of Sinaloa, in downtown Culiacan on May 21, 
officials said. But they conceded that the so-called intellectual authors of 
the crime have not been found. 
</P>
<P>
State police indicated Corona's death was ordered by a drug kingpin because she 
had uncovered information connecting him to the murders of three Venezuelans 
and a Mexican lawyer last February. 
</P>
<P>
"She had touched powerful interests," Fernando Torres Gomez, an investigator 
for the state attorney general's office, told reporters at a press conference 
here. 
</P>
<P>
But Jorge Higuera, Corona's colleague in a Sinaloa lawyers association, said 
the motive for and the mastermind of the killing were still unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
"There is great uncertainty about who and why. We have the material authors, 
but we want the intellectual authors, the ones who paid. The motive has not 
been established," Higuera said. 
</P>
<P>
He noted afterward that Corona had told her colleagues she was "very concerned 
and afraid" of the Federal Judicial Police, whom she suspected in the four 
earlier killings. 
</P>
<P>
In response to national and international pressure, President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari created a national human rights commission last month to pursue this 
case and other alleged abuses. His government's human rights record has come 
under sharp attack from the U.S.-based Americas Watch and other rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to show progress, the federal attorney general's office flew dozens of 
reporters to this northwestern farming state for the press conference with Gov. 
Francisco Labastida Ochoa and state police officials. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the suspects -- Jacobo Chavez Lafarga, alias "The Horse," and Jorge 
Rosario Quintero -- are former police officers. The other suspects are Camilo 
Beltran Gastelum and Fermin Beltran Murillo. 
</P>
<P>
A fifth suspect, Santos Arellano Bazan, also a former state police officer, was 
killed in a shoot-out in Tijuana last Friday, police said. Higuera said he 
believes that Santos was slain when police tried to capture him. 
</P>
<P>
Several other suspects remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the charges are based on the suspects' confessions but that they 
do not have the murder weapons or evidence such as ballistics tests connecting 
them to the killing. Police said they have found the blue pickup truck that 
witness said was used by the gunmen and that police uniforms were found in a 
safehouse used by the suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities assert that alleged drug trafficker Luis (El Guero) Palmas is 
behind the four killings in February and Corona's murder. 
</P>
<P>
The victims of the February killings were abducted from their homes at 
gunpoint, and their tortured bodies were discovered nearly three weeks later. 
Family members said the kidnapers identified themselves as Federal Judicial 
Police. 
</P>
<P>
No one has been arrested in connection with those killings. 
</P>
<P>
Corona had been investigating the murders. She was gunned down in the street as 
she tried to flee from gunmen who followed her when she left her office.

MANDELA SUGGESTS PEACEFUL SOLUTION FOR IRA, BRITAIN;

<P>
Black leader Nelson Mandela on Monday urged Britain and the Irish Republican 
Army to follow the example of his African National Congress and the South 
African government and begin to negotiate an end to 20 years of bloodshed in 
Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
"People are slaughtering one another when they could sit down and address the 
problems in a peaceful manner," Mandela, who is on a worldwide tour to boost 
his anti-apartheid campaign, told a Dublin news conference. 
</P>
<P>
Almost 3,000 people have died and 30,000 have been hurt in the 20-year-long 
fight by IRA guerrillas to oust Britain from Northern Ireland and unite the 
province with the Irish Republic. 
</P>
<P>
"What we would like to see is that the British government and the IRA should 
adopt the precise line we have taken," Mandela said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 71-year-old Mandela was freed from prison in February, the ANC has 
begun tentative talks with South Africa's white minority government about the 
country's future. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela flew to Dublin on Sunday from an eight-city tour of the United States, 
where he was criticized for praising Cuban President Fidel Castro, Libyan 
leader Moammar Kadafi and Palestine Liberation Organization chief Yasser 
Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
Choosing his words carefully when asked if he supports the IRA, Mandela said: 
"The issue is that differences have arisen. As a result of those differences, 
many people have died. What is the sense in continuing with that mutual 
slaughter when they could sit down and discuss peace?" 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who is deputy president of the ANC, denied that his group had ever had 
contact with the IRA. 
</P>
<P>
"We have certainly had no meetings with the IRA," he said. "We are an 
organization committed to peace, and if we resorted to violence (it was 
because) we had no alternative." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela will meet with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in London on Wednesday.

KREMLIN CHIEF UNFLAPPABLE UNDER FIRE

<TEXT>
<P>
The only hint of pressure on Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Monday 
was the soft, southern Russian accent that kept slipping into his rich 
baritone. 
</P>
<P>
During a three-hour speech that made no apologies to increasingly critical 
party conservatives, Gorbachev entered the reputed lion's den of the 28th 
Communist Party Congress exuding confidence and well-choreographed 
congeniality. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and his perestroika reform program are under fire at the congress 
that some worry could be his last stand. A Siberian delegate from the gulag 
city of Magadan leaped up at the very start to demand that Gorbachev and his 
Politburo resign. 
</P>
<P>
Unflinchingly all-business, Gorbachev nodded thoughtfully, pushed back his 
steel-rimmed spectacles and called on the next man wanting to speak. 
</P>
<P>
Despite fears that he would be intimidated by a recent upsurge in 
anti-perestroika conservatism that was evident at last month's congress to 
re-establish a separate Communist Party for the Russian Republic, Gorbachev 
gave no ground to the right. 
</P>
<P>
He chatted and chortled throughout the day with embattled Prime Minister 
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who some thought he might use as a fall guy. Gorbachev's 
sharpest words were aimed at the prime minister's ill-considered price reform 
plan, but he made a show of solidarity with his government chief by taking him 
along for a seemingly impromptu walkabout on Red Square to collect accolades 
and accusations from the Soviet public. 
</P>
<P>
Between shouts of "Good luck" and "We are with you," the Soviet leader heard 
laments about inadequate food and wretched living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"My son is sick, and I can get no help," one tearful woman shouted to Gorbachev 
as he approached the cordoned-off crowd to press the flesh. Immediately 
concerned and paternal, he asked her to write to him and dispatched two aides 
to explain how to get in touch. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by Western journalists if he would lose heart and leave the leadership, 
he replied it was the people's call if they wanted to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not raise my own ambitions here," he stated nonchalantly. 
</P>
<P>
He put off another journalist's question with a smile and a daring joke about 
the need to wait in line, a sore subject in a crowd of frustrated Soviet 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's economic woes are at the root of Gorbachev's political troubles, 
and reminders of persistent shortages have poked through the veneer of progress 
at the party conference. 
</P>
<P>
Vinyl briefcases were doled out to delegates to provide them with party 
documents as well as souvenir notebooks and shiny pen-and-pencil sets -- minus 
the ink and lead cartridges to make the instruments functional. 
</P>
<P>
Spare parts are hard to come by -- even for the elite. 
</P>
<P>
For those on the other side of the Kremlin's crenelated red walls, life is even 
tougher with so many movers and shakers in town. Public transport is 
commandeered to shuttle the nearly 4,700 delegates between the congress hall 
and the Moscow hotels they have filled to overflowing. Traffic is halted for 
the seemingly endless motorcades, and pedestrians are shooed from their usual 
routes to ease crowding around the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
The few desirable foods and consumer goods will become even scarcer by the end 
of the congress, as delegates from distant regions cart off the capital's 
comparative wealth. 
</P>
<P>
There was never much need for precise counting of votes at past congresses, 
when virtually every measure was approved unanimously with a simultaneous wave 
of red party cards. But democracy creates new demands, and the cavernous 
meeting hall of the Palace of Congresses has been outfitted with new electronic 
voting machines and a flashy multicolored tote board. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates clucked with impressed interest and toyed with the new gadgets built 
into the back of each red-upholstered seat. Apparently unavailable from the 
assembly lines of this nation just getting acquainted with pluralism, the new 
system was provided by the Philips electronics firm based in the Netherlands.

It shouldn't have come as news to most Soviet people that the status of women 
in their country leaves much to be desired. 
</P>
<P>
But President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's sharp denunciation of the overwork and 
under-appreciation accorded the female population curiously created the biggest 
stir during his three-hour address to the 28th Communist Party Congress on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we should be ashamed of ourselves now that we see women take an active 
part in big politics in many countries," Gorbachev lamented toward the end of 
his all-encompassing report on Soviet life. "Just take a look at this assembly 
-- how many women are there among the delegates?" 
</P>
<P>
No official statistics were released Monday on the composition of the congress, 
but women appeared to make up far less than 10% of the nearly 4,700 delegates. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a matter of men's honor to do their utmost to ease the situation of 
women, though much can be done by the women themselves, if they manage to 
organize themselves," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all Soviet women work at full-time jobs, and a tenaciously traditional 
social atmosphere compels them to carry the burden of child-rearing, shopping 
and housework as well. 
</P>
<P>
About 30% of the party's 18 million members are women, but the leading ranks 
are dominated by men. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps we should take real steps at this very congress to have women 
represented in the Central Committee, at the Politburo and the Central 
Committee Secretariat," the Kremlin leader suggested. 
</P>
<P>
But one female delegate complained that the party gets too bogged down in 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of more women, but more clever women," said Tamara Alaiba, 
a medical institute director from Sverdlovsk. "It's not a resolution of the 
women's question simply to change the numbers."

NO ONE 'LOST' EAST EUROPE, GORBACHEV SAYS;

CONGRESS: THE FREEDOM OF FOREIGN NATIONS IS NOT OUR BUSINESS, THE PRESIDENT 
TELLS PARTY LEADERS.

Weighing in on the recent Kremlin debate over "who lost Eastern Europe," 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev contended Monday that the freedom of foreign 
nations is not the Soviet Union's to give or take away. 
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the opening session of the 28th Communist Party Congress, 
Gorbachev rejected the imposition of ideology on former allies as a remnant of 
the Stalinist past that he has been trying to exorcise with perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
"When somebody says that this is the 'collapse of socialism,' we counter it 
with the question: What socialism?" Gorbachev said, discussing Soviet foreign 
relations. "That which had been, in point of fact, a variation of Stalin's 
authoritarian bureaucratic system -- which we have ourselves discarded?" 
</P>
<P>
His defense of the Kremlin's recent go-your-own-way doctrine in Eastern Europe 
served both to assure the neighboring nations that their revolutions are safe 
from Soviet interference and to tie his own flagging reform program to the 
efforts that have brought freely elected governments to power and begun the 
transition to market economies there. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov 
squared off in the press last week with opposing views on whether last year's 
overthrow of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe was a blow to Soviet security 
or a boost to the forces of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Yazov argued that the democratic upheavals in once-fraternal nations have 
undermined the Warsaw Pact defense alliance, while rival NATO has made no 
attempt to change its military posture. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary has vowed to pull out of the Warsaw Pact next year, with Czechoslovakia 
indicating similar interest and East Germany merging economically with the NATO 
front-line state of West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Comecon, the 10-nation socialist trading alliance dominated by the Soviet 
Union, has begun unraveling as the new democracies look for business ties to 
the West. Moscow said last week that in the future, it will conduct all its 
trade with Comecon members in U.S. dollars rather than Soviet rubles. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Communist Party daily Pravda, Shevardnadze last week 
dismissed the claims of a security setback, arguing that "neither socialism nor 
friendship, neither respect nor good relations can rest on bayonets, tanks or 
bloodshed." 
</P>
<P>
Invading Soviet tanks crushed attempts to throw off communism in Hungary in 
1956 and efforts at reforming it in Czechoslovakia in 1968, drawing 
condemnation in the West and sowing resentment throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev made clear during his three-hour speech that he sides with his 
foreign minister, praising the restoration of freedom in the Eastern European 
nations forced into the Communist fold after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"We are even reproached with 'leaving the field without fighting,' " Gorbachev 
said in apparent reference to comments that Yazov made in an interview with the 
newspaper Workers' Tribune. "It comes out that we are advised to resort just to 
what we resorted before and what we have unequivocally broken with and 
emphatically denounced." 
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin leader reiterated his promise to stay out of the decisions of 
sovereign nations about what kind of governments they choose to create.

PREGNANT WOMEN WARNED ON ASPIRIN

The Food and Drug Administration on Monday announced stronger warnings against 
the use of over-the-counter aspirin products by women in the last three months 
of pregnancy unless directed by a physician. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said the stronger warning on labels is being required because 
aspirin can affect fetal circulation and uterine contraction. 
</P>
<P>
The new warning must immediately follow a more general caution telling pregnant 
women and nursing mothers to check with a health professional before using 
aspirin or any other drug. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA said manufacturers have 12 months to implement the label changes, 
recommended by an advisory panel of non-government medical experts. The 
regulation will be published Thursday in the Federal Register. 
</P>
<P>
A similar warning is already required on non-prescription products containing 
ibuprofen, another pain-relieving ingredient. Aspirin and ibuprofen have 
similar pharmacologic effects. 
</P>
<P>
The new warning must read: 
</P>
<P>
"It is especially important not to use aspirin during the last three months of 
pregnancy unless specifically directed to do so by a doctor because it may 
cause problems in the unborn child or complications during delivery."

INCOME TAX INCREASE NOT RULED OUT, BUSH AIDE SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: A STATEMENT BY SEN. DOLE IS DISAVOWED. EVERYTHING IS STILL ON THE 
DEFICIT NEGOTIATING TABLE, THE WHITE HOUSE CONTENDS.

<P>
The White House on Monday disavowed an influential Senate Republican's 
statement that President Bush has ruled out income tax increases as part of a 
deficit reduction deal. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not made any assurances on anything. Everything is on the table and open 
for discussion," White House Deputy Press Secretary Alixe Glen said, responding 
to questions about a statement made by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
Dole had said on a television interview program Sunday that Bush is "not going 
to raise personal income tax rates . . . . He's not going to go along with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
When asked if that statement reflected Bush's views, Glen said: "No. I think 
that's Sen. Dole's personal prediction . . . . Right now, there is nothing that 
is ruled out or ruled in." 
</P>
<P>
Bush is at his vacation home here preparing for back-to-back meetings that 
begin Thursday in London when North Atlantic Treaty Organization leaders 
convene and continue Monday in Houston with the heads of the major industrial 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
The back-and-forth on income taxes is part of the continued political posturing 
that began last week when Bush formally abandoned his campaign pledge of "no 
new taxes" and conceded that "tax revenue increases" are needed to narrow the 
government's growing deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Many Democratic leaders have insisted that, if taxes are going to be raised, 
the bulk of the new revenues should come from upper-income taxpayers who 
benefited most from the tax cuts of the Ronald Reagan years. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats' chief target has been a quirk of the tax laws known in 
legislative jargon as the "bubble," under which many middle-income taxpayers 
face a top marginal tax rate of 33%, while the richest Americans pay only 28% 
on income that exceeds the bracket covered by the "bubble." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, conservative Republicans, in revolt since Bush abandoned his 
anti-tax promise, have declared that they will oppose any move to change income 
tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
The White House and GOP leaders have been trying to placate both groups, 
tossing hints to the conservatives that income tax rates are off limits but 
assuring Democrats that everything is up for negotiation. The theory behind the 
strategy is that, if Bush is forced to accept an income tax hike, his aides 
will be able to tell conservatives that they tried to fend off the increase 
but, in the end, had to give in. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, government accountants expect the deficit for the fiscal year 
beginning Oct. 1 to be roughly $160 billion, not counting the cost of the 
savings and loan bailout. If those costs are included, the deficit would be 
well over $200 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Unless current budget-balancing laws are changed, Bush will be required to 
order across-the-board cuts of $100 billion or more in government programs. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid those cuts, Bush and Democratic leaders will have to reach a deal to 
change existing law. Both sides say that the deal envisioned probably would 
reduce the deficit by about $50 billion, roughly half from tax increases, the 
other half from spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Such a deal would still leave a substantial deficit, but officials say that any 
larger cut would throw the economy into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous proposals for tax increases and spending cuts have been circulating 
around Washington for weeks, but White House aides and congressional staff 
members say that budget negotiators still are weeks away from reaching 
agreement.

EX-MODEL TELLS JURY BARRY HAD A 'DESIRE' FOR COCAINE; 
</P>
<P>
DRUGS: RASHEEDA MOORE ADMITS INITIATING DISCUSSION OF SMOKING CRACK. 
CROSS-EXAMINATION DOES LITTLE TO BOLSTER DEFENSE POSITION.

The woman who invited Marion Barry into the undercover sting that videotaped 
him smoking crack cocaine testified Monday that the Washington mayor seemed 
suspicious, but smoked the cocaine pipe anyway "because he had a desire to." 
</P>
<P>
During intense cross-examination by Barry's defense lawyer, R. Kenneth Mundy, 
former model Rasheeda Moore conceded little to strengthen Mundy's claim that 
Barry was improperly trapped into a crime that he did not intend. However, she 
did admit reintroducing the subject of cocaine after Barry repeatedly declined 
interest and Mundy pointed to what he said were seven declarations by Barry 
that he wanted no cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union on Monday 
appealed a decision by Federal Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to bar two black 
activist leaders invited by Barry to attend the trial last week. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring that Barry's constitutional rights to a public trial were infringed, 
the ACLU asked the Federal Court of Appeals to open the courtroom to Louis 
Farrakhan, Nation of Islam leader, and Father George A. Stallings Jr., a 
dissident priest and founder of the African-American Catholic Congregation. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Jackson barred both men on grounds that their presence would be 
"potentially disruptive" and "very likely intimidating." They each had been 
invited by the defense to attend the trial, using one of four observer passes 
given to the defense team. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Farrakhan's group stood silently outside court holding placards 
calling for Jackson to prove that Farrakhan would be disruptive. "For which of 
his good acts do you condemn him?" read one placard. "Mayor Barry has a right 
to a public trial, not a press trial," read another. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the courtroom, Mundy continued to prod Moore into conceding that she, 
not Barry, repeatedly initiated discussions of cocaine. Noting that Barry 
several times asked how to use a crack pipe Moore supplied, Mundy demanded: 
"How could he say that if he had been doing it (smoking crack cocaine) as 
regularly as you say?" Moore had testified that she and Barry had used cocaine 
"over 100 times" during a three-year period beginning in mid-1986. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure Mr. Barry has been in situations before in hotels," Moore said. "He's 
an intelligent man." 
</P>
<P>
"If he was so cautious and guarded in his speech as you say," Mundy asked, "why 
did he go on a few minutes later and hit the pipe?" 
</P>
<P>
"Because he had a desire to," Moore replied. 
</P>
<P>
Moore noted that at the time Barry had already become enmeshed in problems 
because of his visits to drug dealer Charles Lewis at the Ramada Inn. The 
mayor, she said, knew "how to handle himself in a hotel situation." 
</P>
<P>
"I have no reason to say anything that is not true," she added. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll see," retorted Mundy. 
</P>
<P>
Moore provided the "pipe . . . the light . . . the know-how . . . the liquor . 
. . the room and the encouragement by bringing the subject up ad nauseum," said 
Mundy. 
</P>
<P>
Moore did not respond, because the judge sustained objections by assistant U.S. 
Atty. Judith Retchin.

MISALIGNMENT OF SHUTTLES' FUEL TANKS STUDIED

NASA engineers are focusing on a small misalignment of fuel tanks and 
spacecraft on two space shuttles as they search for the cause of hydrogen leaks 
that have grounded the shuttle fleet. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is throwing the shuttle schedule into disarray and threatens to 
postpone at least two missions this summer, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 35 orbiter-tank combinations flown so far have had some 
misalignments, but the two found in the shuttles with the leaks are the largest 
to date, spaceflight director William B. Lenoir said. 
</P>
<P>
Lenoir said the leak problem -- which shows up while the tank is being filled 
with supercold liquid hydrogen a few hours before flight -- must be fixed 
within a few weeks to keep NASA anywhere near its ambitious flight schedule. 
</P>
<P>
NASA's science chief, Lennard Fisk, sought to put a brighter view on NASA's 
other headache, the faulty mirror on the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope 
that prevents the accurate focusing that scientists need. 
</P>
<P>
NASA is consulting with experts in image processing -- using technology to 
enhance pictures received from the telescope. 
</P>
<P>
"There is growing optimism that we will be successful," Fisk said. "Six months 
from now, a year from now, I expect you all to ooh and aah over the picture 
that Hubble is going to produce."

ALFRED WOODFORD; GEOLOGY TEACHER AT POMONA COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alfred O. Woodford, founding director of the Pomona College geology department 
nearly 70 years ago and a teacher who trained many of the best-known geologists 
on the West Coast, has died at a retirement community in Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
Don Pattison, a spokesman for the college, said Woodford, known to his 
colleagues and students as "Woody," was 100 when he died Friday. He had retired 
in 1955 after an affiliation with Pomona that began in 1909 as a student. 
</P>
<P>
A native of Upland, his father, Butler A. Woodford, was manager of the Sunkist 
Orange Assn., while his grandfather, Alfred P. Harwood, was a member of the 
Chaffey Land Co., which began developing the area that today is Ontario and 
Upland. The Harwoods were among the earliest supporters of Pomona College. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred Woodford, who graduated from Pomona in 1913, enrolled there to become a 
soil scientist. But the embryonic oil boom then under way led him into geology. 
He began teaching geology in 1919 while taking graduate classes at UC Berkeley. 
After receiving his doctorate three years later he founded a one-man 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years its students came to include Rollin Eckis, former executive 
chairman of the board of the Atlantic Richfield Co., Roger Revelle, former 
director of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography for whom UC San Diego's 
Revelle College is named, and C. A. Anderson, former head of the U.S. 
Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
Woodford's special field of study included the rocks and minerals of Southern 
and Baja California, stream hydraulics and the history of geology. 
</P>
<P>
When he retired he was given the Neil A. Miner Award, the highest award of the 
National Assn. of Geology Teachers. In 1963, to commemorate the 75th 
anniversary of the Geological Society of America, Woodford and some of his 
former students wrote "The Fabric of Geology." 
</P>
<P>
A widower, Woodford is survived by two daughters, six grandchildren and five 
great-grandchildren.

GENETIC ENGINEERING ACHIEVES 'MAJOR STEP' TOWARD HEMOPHILIA CURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Implants of genetically engineered skin cells in dogs with hemophilia B, a rare 
bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly, can bring the 
symptoms under control for short periods, according to researchers from the 
Salk Institute in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Although the researchers have many technical obstacles to overcome before the 
new approach can produce a cure in the animals, their research, reported Monday 
in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, represents 
a bold new approach to this genetic disorder, which is presently treated with 
an expensive protein isolated from concentrated blood plasma. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a major step forward toward a cure for hemophilia," said hematologist 
Frederick Rickles of the University of Connecticut School of Medicine. "I think 
it's just terribly exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Hemophilia afflicts as many as 20,000 males in the United States. Women can 
carry the gene for the disorder, but generally do not develop it. 
</P>
<P>
It is caused by a defective gene that would normally serve as a blueprint for a 
protein that plays a crucial role in the clotting process that prevents people 
from bleeding to death after being cut or wounded. It exists in two main forms, 
called A and B. 
</P>
<P>
Hemophilia A, the more common form and the type which is associated with 
European royalty, is caused by a defect in a protein called Factor VIII. 
Hemophilia B, also known as Christmas disease after the surname of the first 
two people diagnosed with it, is caused by a defect in a protein called Factor 
IX. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the only treatment for either type is injections of either Factor 
VIII or Factor IX isolated from the blood of healthy individuals. Because the 
proteins are present in blood in only very small quantities, large volumes of 
blood must be pooled for the isolation procedure, greatly increasing the risk 
that the material will be contaminated with the viruses that cause hepatitis or 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 90% to 95% of the nation's 7,000 to 9,000 hemophiliacs with the 
most severe cases of the disease are thought to be infected with the AIDS 
virus. Among moderate hemophiliacs, who require fewer injections, the infection 
rate is thought to be between 40% and 50%. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers have developed techniques to cleanse blood products of viruses, but 
the isolated protein is very expensive. A year's treatment may cost as much as 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative to collecting Factor VIII from blood, researchers have 
produced it in the laboratory using genetic engineering techniques. This 
product has been successfully tested in humans, but the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration has not approved it for marketing. Genetically engineered Factor 
IX has not yet been tested in humans. 
</P>
<P>
The new research reported Monday opens the door to a technique by which 
hemophiliacs would produce the protein in their own body. 
</P>
<P>
The research was conducted using dogs which suffer from hemophilia B. They are 
maintained in a unique colony at the University of North Carolina in Chapel 
Hill by pathologists Marjorie S. Read and Kenneth M. Brinkhous. Called keagles, 
the animals arose from a cross between a cairn terrier and a beagle, and the 
colony has been maintained for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
Salk Institute molecular biologists Jonathan H. Axelrod and Inder M. Verma took 
skin cells from keagles and used a specially designed virus to introduce a 
healthy gene for Factor IX into them. Their paper reports that the cells 
produce and secrete Factor IX. 
</P>
<P>
Axelrod and Verma have constructed mini-organs with the engineered cells and 
implanted them under the skin of the keagles. The implant produces Factor IX 
for at least a few weeks and the animals' blood will clot normally, Axelrod 
said. But the clotting time gets longer and longer, indicating failure of the 
implant. 
</P>
<P>
So far, he said, "we can't pinpoint a specific problem." It may be that the 
cells are dying or that they stop producing Factor IX. The researchers are 
trying to isolate and correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not discouraged by that," said Rickles, vice president of medical affairs 
for the National Hemophilia Foundation. "While it may take some time, we are on 
the right track."

ASIANS PROTEST CENSUS FOLLOW-UP PROCEDURES; 
</P>
<P>
MINORITIES: A PLAN TO LUMP THEM WITH WHITES IN A DOOR-TO-DOOR POST-EMUNERATION 
SURVEY IS UNDER REVIEW, OFFICIALS SAY.

<P>
Census officials, reacting to criticism from Asian community leaders, said 
Monday that they will consider modifying a post-census survey in hopes of more 
accurately tabulating the nation's Asian population. 
</P>
<P>
Asian leaders from the San Francisco Bay Area to Los Angeles have decried the 
so-called "post-enumeration survey," saying it will ignore their community at a 
time when Asians are the fastest-growing ethnic group in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The post-enumeration survey, scheduled to begin this month, is designed to 
assure that minority groups and the poor are not undercounted in the nearly 
completed U.S. census. 
</P>
<P>
The study is to be based on door-to-door interviews with 150,000 households, 
the results of which will be compared to completed census forms for those same 
households. Discrepancies will be noted and used to determine if members of 
minority groups or those who fall within certain income levels were 
undercounted. 
</P>
<P>
The criticism arose because Asians, while listed separately on the survey 
forms, were to be grouped together with whites in the study. Los Angeles 
officials have estimated that Asians were undercounted by 7.3% in the 1980 
census. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last decade Asian-Americans have fought two presidential 
administrations to ensure a correct count," Secretary of State March Fong Eu 
said Monday at a press conference in Los Angeles. "Now the Asian community is 
back at ground zero." 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park Mayor Judy Chu, who joined Eu at the press conference, said: 
"There's absolutely no justification to exclude Asians. In fact, there's even 
more justification to include us. Immigrants are not familiar with the 
census-taking process and may have undercounted family members." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert Matsui (D-Sacramento) and Rep. Norman Mineta (D-San Jose) also have 
criticized the study and, last week, joined with about a dozen other members of 
Congress to sign a letter of protest directed at the Commerce Department and 
the Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Before their announcement Monday, census officials had defended their policy, 
claiming that Asians are such a small percentage of the U.S. population that 
the post-census count cannot determine if they have been undercounted. Under 
the bureau's current plan, blacks and Latinos would be included in separate 
categories in the count. Anglos, Asians, Pacific Islanders and American Indians 
who do not live on reservations would be in a third category. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Charles Jones, associate director of the Census Bureau, said the 
bureau would "look at" changing its study as the result of telephone calls and 
letters demanding that Asians be counted accurately. "I can't promise anything 
right now . . . but it's certainly feasible to look at that and see if we can 
(count Asians) separately" in the post-census count, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Asian community has burgeoned with an influx of Chinese, Vietnamese and 
Cambodian immigrants to the San Gabriel Valley, Orange County and the San 
Francisco Bay Area. Asians and Pacific Islanders make up 12.6% of Los Angeles 
County's population, according to 1990 estimates by the county Department of 
Health Services. They make up about 9.5% of California's 29 million residents, 
according to 1989 Department of Finance estimates. Blacks comprise 7.5%, and 
Latinos 24.2%, of the state population. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Census Bureau agrees to change its way of conducting the 
post-census count, it is unclear whether the results will be used to adjust 
final census figures. Census officials said they have made no decision on how 
and whether the count will be used despite demands by officials in Los Angeles, 
California, Chicago, Houston, New York and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
City and state officials charge that the Commerce Department failed to live up 
to a court-sanctioned agreement that spells out the conditions under which the 
census would be adjusted to correct for undercounted populations. 
</P>
<P>
The cities and states argued in a 1988 lawsuit that they stand to lose millions 
of dollars in federal funds as a result of undercounted minorities and the 
poor. These critics contend that many members of minority groups and the poor 
avoid the census because of language barriers, ignorance or distrust of 
authorities. Latino and black civil rights organizations also were plaintiffs 
in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
In the settlement with the Commerce Department last year, Los Angeles officials 
assumed Asians would be counted as a separate group in the post-enumeration 
survey, said Deputy City Atty. Jessica Heinz.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 AGENTS CHARGED IN INSURANCE SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two San Fernando Valley insurance agents have been charged with grand theft for 
allegedly bilking thousands of dollars from elderly victims by overcharging 
them for health insurance and persuading them to invest in a bogus company, 
investigators said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The agents -- Eric P. Jacobs, 43, of Burbank, and Mitchell S. Horowitz, 39, of 
Northridge -- preyed on elderly, often frail and lonely women, investigators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The yearlong investigation by state Department of Insurance investigators and 
the LAPD fraud unit indicates Jacobs and Horowitz may have bilked up to 
$400,000 from as many as nine clients over the last five years, investigators 
said. But some of the alleged victims have died, making it impossible to file 
charges in those cases. Jacobs has been charged with five counts of grand theft 
and Horowitz with four counts in connection with five victims who lost a total 
of about $80,000, said Dennis Ward, chief investigator for the state insurance 
department.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BUSINESSMAN SLAIN IN CLASH WITH LOITERERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Atwater Village business owner who armed himself with a rifle to chase away 
a group of loitering men was shot to death with his own weapon and his friend 
was seriously wounded, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The businessman, whose name was withheld until relatives could be notified, was 
shot during an argument with four or five men at A.Z. Sheet Metal in the 3500 
block of Hollydale Drive about 11:50 p.m. Sunday, Lt. Rob Watters said. 
</P>
<P>
The man was pronounced dead on arrival at Glendale Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Officers discovered a second victim inside the closed business. That man, whose 
name also was withheld, was in guarded condition at County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Watters said a dispute between the men escalated into a fight and the business 
owner armed himself with a rifle. The suspects wrested the gun from the victim 
and shot both victims.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY URGES EMPHASIS ON PREVENTING DRUG 
ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying anti-drug efforts should begin in kindergarten, Mayor Tom Bradley on 
Monday told a congressional subcommittee meeting in Los Angeles that the 
federal war on drugs should include more emphasis on prevention and 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley complained that President Bush's $10.6-billion anti-drug program 
concentrates too heavily on law enforcement efforts and fails to attack the 
socioeconomic factors that lead to drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
Repeating a complaint he made in Washington last fall, Bradley told the 
subcommittee that Los Angeles does not get its fair share of drug money.

SPRAY PAINT BAN PROPOSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City and state officials Monday announced a legislative proposal calling for a 
ban on selling spray-paint cans to all but commercial users. 
</P>
<P>
Officials say the bill, being drafted by state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), 
is necessary because police have been unable to arrest graffiti vandals, many 
of whom work in late-night teams. 
</P>
<P>
If the bill passes, sellers could sell spray paint to customers 18 years and 
older, but, beginning Jan. 1, 1991, would have to lock cans away. 
</P>
<P>
By January, 1992, spray cans would be available only to commercial businesses. 
</P>
<P>
The bill also calls for sellers who violate the restrictions to pay fines of 
$50 per can or $1,000, whichever is greater.

IMPERILED UCLA CHICANO STUDIES MAJOR TO BE SAVED; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: LOW FUNDING AND ENROLLMENT HURT THE PROGRAM. AN INFUSION OF MONEY 
AND STAFF IS ANNOUNCED.

The Chicano studies major at UCLA, which was in danger of being suspended, has 
been bolstered with new funding and support from Chancellor Charles E. Young. 
</P>
<P>
The Committee to Administer the Chicano Studies Major will be given one staff 
member, one researcher, office space and supplies, university officials said. 
In addition, the committee will receive funds to increase faculty, reorganize 
the major and develop more introductory courses, which have been taught by 
instructors in various departments, including history, sociology, Spanish and 
Portuguese. 
</P>
<P>
Officials put the cost of those services at between $150,000 and $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We ought to have a very good, high-quality Chicano studies program," Young 
said Monday after a meeting to discuss ways to improve the major. 
</P>
<P>
While interdisciplinary Chicano studies courses have been popular on the campus 
over the last 21 years, only 12 students majored in the field during the last 
school year, and no Chicano studies courses were offered last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Students and Latino faculty members said basic problems included inadequate 
funding and administrative structure. The major has been handled by a committee 
operating on an annual budget of $1,500 and is not part of an academic 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond L. Orbach, provost of the College of Letters and Science, said a 
faculty Senate committee recommended last spring that admissions into the 
program be halted. "We felt that there was not a strong faculty oversight and 
that many of the courses were not offered on a regular basis," Orbach said. 
</P>
<P>
But those plans were dropped after Latino students, including members of the 
Chicano/Latino student group Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Atzlan, held 
rallies to protest the proposed suspension. 
</P>
<P>
"The students were very helpful in seeing that this issue got more attention 
more quickly than it would have otherwise," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
The closed-door meeting with faculty members, including Latinos and vice 
chancellors, was called by Young to seek their opinions, according to David 
Hayes-Bautista, director of the UCLA Chicano Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of members of the student group protested because they were not 
invited to participate. "This meeting is a deviation from the process we began 
ourselves," said sophomore Mark Aguilar, educational coordinator for the 
student group. 
</P>
<P>
Some Latino faculty said they felt uncomfortable participating in a meeting 
that had no ties to the Chicano studies committee, chaired by sociology 
professor Vilma Ortiz and history professor George Sanchez. Neither attended 
the meeting, and they were not available for comment Monday.

CAL RIPKEN SETS RECORD STRAIGHT ON HIS DEFENSE; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: ORIOLE SHORTSTOP DOESN'T WIN GOLD GLOVES, BUT AS FOCUS SHIFTS FROM 
OFFENSE TO DEFENSE, HE HAS SHOWN HE KNOWS HOW TO PLAY THE GAME.

<P>
Cal Ripken Jr. has never been flashy enough at shortstop to win a Gold Glove, 
but he has been steady enough to play 73 consecutive games without an error. 
Needless to say, the American League record he set Sunday night should be 
enough to translate into defensive recognition. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think it's tremendous," said Ripken's brother Bill, the Orioles' second 
baseman. "I don't think he's ever been recognized for being a good shortstop. 
All people want to say is he's too big to play shortstop. He doesn't have the 
range of others. 
</P>
<P>
"Be serious. He's led the league in assists five times. He goes out there every 
day. The only thing he doesn't do is get on the highlight reels. He makes all 
the plays look routine. It's about time people realize that." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Ripken made spectacular plays on his only two chances Sunday night to 
break the record set by the Detroit Tigers' Ed Brinkman in 1972. The plays were 
so difficult, they probably would have been scored hits instead of errors if 
they had been flubbed by Ripken. 
</P>
<P>
The first was a backhand in the hole on a grounder by the Minnesota Twins' Gary 
Gaetti in the second inning. The second was a diving stop on another sharply 
hit ball by Gaetti up the middle with two on, none out and the score tied in 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
Ripken lost his cap on the play but flipped to second baseman Tim Hulett for 
the forceout. The Orioles fell, 4-3, when reliever Gregg Olson allowed a single 
to the next hitter, Brian Harper. Ripken said he would have been more elated 
about his record had the score been reversed. 
</P>
<P>
Still, he acknowledged, "It's a little more special because of the fact that 
I've always been considered an offensive shortstop. No one ever focuses on the 
job I do defensively, or how I have to do the job. I'm a little bigger than 
most people. I have to rely on positioning." 
</P>
<P>
At 6-foot-4, Ripken is the tallest everyday shortstop in major league history, 
and one of the most accomplished. He set an American League record with 583 
assists in 1984, and also handled 880 successful chances. Since World War II, 
only the St. Louis Cardinals' Ozzie Smith has handled more in one season (909). 
</P>
<P>
But Ripken, 29, is essentially correct in his belief that he is perceived 
mainly as an offensive player. He was booed at Memorial Stadium last month, 
even while pursuing Brinkman's record, even while moving into second place on 
the all-time consecutive games list. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, of course, was his prolonged batting slump, which he has since 
ended in dramatic fashion. Ripken went three for five Sunday night, pulling the 
Orioles within 3-2 with his ninth home run in the sixth inning, then tying the 
score with an RBI single in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
He has 20 hits in his last 40 at-bats, raising his average from .221 to .257, 
its highest point since April 21. He had hit only two home runs his 45 previous 
games, but is now on pace to finish with 19. He is the only shortstop in 
major-league history to hit 20 for eight consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to evaluate my (offensive) performance," Ripken said. "I would 
just like to stay in a pretty good groove, just try to go in the direction I 
have without saying why I came out of it or how I came out of it. I just want 
to continue going in the right direction, the right way." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the most amazing thing about his record might be the way it has 
shifted attention from his offense to his defense. Ripken has handled 322 
chances during his streak, which began April 14 in Detroit. The major league 
record for one season is 331, set by Brinkman in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
"He's like a hitter right now, in a good groove," Oriole Manager Frank Robinson 
said before Sunday night's game. "The balls are hit to him, he makes the plays. 
He makes it look effortless, easy. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't have the range, per se, of an Ozzie Smith or (Tony Fernandez). But 
he positions himself so he doesn't have to move 20 or 30 feet to get to a ball. 
He doesn't do it in a fashion that draws attention. But he covers the ground a 
shortstop has to cover. And he makes the plays." 
</P>
<P>
Ripken's only error this season came on a Friday the 13th. He must again play 
on that unlucky day this month to continue his pursuit of the major-league 
record for consecutive games by a shortstop without an error -- 88, set by the 
New York Mets' Kevin Elster in 1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
Others might be superstitious. Not Ripken. 
</P>
<P>
"I was married on Friday the 13th," he said.

Digital Sound Stock Plummets: The Santa Barbara maker of voice-mail equipment 
for businesses lost 46% of its stock market value after disclosing that it 
probably will record a second-quarter loss. 
</P>
<P>
The stock plunged $4.25 to $5 on volume of 490,900 shares. The company said the 
expected loss will stem from slower than anticipated orders from some major 
customers. Digital has been wracked with problems since its initial public 
stock offering on Feb. 26, at $8.50 a share. Digital said its second-quarter 
order problems were compounded by grass fires last week in Santa Barbara 
because many employees were unable to get to work.

MCI's Credit Rating Lowered: Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., a major credit-rating 
agency, downgraded its rating on some of MCI Communication Corp.'s debt. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;P said it lowered by one notch its ratings on MCI's senior unsecured debt 
and subordinated debt due to MCI's acquisition of Telecom USA Inc., another 
long-distance phone company. "The acquisition, which will likely be financed 
with borrowings of up to $1.5 billion, should initially result in a sharp 
deterioration in the capital structure (of MCI) and correspondingly higher 
fixed charges," S&amp;P said. Kathleen Keegan, a spokeswoman for MCI, said the 
company was disappointed by the rating change.

Venezuela to Remain in OPEC: Venezuelan officials denied rumors that Venezuela 
would leave the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries but 
expressed concern about the cartel's overproduction and its depressing effect 
on world prices. "The report that Venezuela is considering leaving OPEC is 
false," said Gonzalo Barrios, president of the Democratic Action Party. "But we 
must protest the noncompliance with production quotas that have generated a new 
crisis in the organization."

UNIVERSAL TO BUY 18-SCREEN THEATER COMPLEX; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: THE STUDIO HAS AGREED TO PAY AILING CINEPLEX ODEON $45 MILLION 
FOR THE FACILITY, WHICH OVERLOOKS ITS BACK LOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Universal Studios has agreed to buy the luxurious, 18-screen Universal City 
Cinemas complex from the debt-ridden Cineplex Odeon Corp. for $45 million, the 
exhibitor announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The state-of-the-art facility, which sits on a hill overlooking the 
MCA/Universal headquarters and the popular Universal Studios tour, would be 
acquired by Universal by Sept. 26 under the terms of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Cineplex Odeon would continue to manage the theater complex through its 
subsidiary, Plitt Theatres Inc. Proceeds from the sale would go to reduce the 
debt load of the Toronto-based exhibitor, which has been actively selling off 
theaters in an effort to regain its financial footing. 
</P>
<P>
"This transaction reflects Cineplex Odeon's previously stated intention to 
reduce debt, while protecting our strategic position in major markets," company 
President and Chief Executive Allen Karp said in a prepared statement. "Our 
continuing management of Universal City Cinemas preserves . . . our strong 
participation in the Los Angeles market." 
</P>
<P>
Cineplex Odeon continues to operate several theaters in the Los Angeles area, 
including the Cineplex in the Beverly Center, the Cineplex Odeon Broadway 
Cinemas in Santa Monica, the Century Plaza Cinemas, the Fairfax Cinema, the 
Marina/Marketplace Cinema, the Odeon Cinema in Westwood and the Cineplex Odeon 
Showcase on La Brea Avenue near Melrose Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
MCA Inc., Universal's parent company, owns a 50% stake in Cineplex Odeon. 
MCA/Universal executives declined comment on the sale Monday. But Los Angeles 
securities analyst Jeffrey Logsdon of Crowell Weedon &amp; Co. called the 
purchase a wise move. Logsdon said MCA/Universal can use the 6,000-seat 
complex, which features multicolored marble tiles, marble pillars, a grand 
staircase and 47-foot-high ceilings, as a showcase for its films. 
</P>
<P>
"Within some kind of reasonable financial parameters it makes great sense for 
MCA/Universal to own the theaters on their lot," Logsdon said. "It's part of 
the attraction of Universal City, and it's a way to highlight what are 
inarguably some of the better screens in the marketplace with their own 
product. Plus, it's another way to take advantage of their competitors. When 
you own the theaters, you don't have to play everyone else's movies." 
</P>
<P>
MCA/Universal also appears to be getting a good deal in the purchase of the 
complex. When Cineplex founder and former chairman Garth H. Drabinsky tried to 
take the company private last year, MCA and another major investor considered 
buying the Universal City Cinemas for $57 million. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, the glamorous complex remains a reflection of Drabinsky, whose 
lavish spending habits left the company on the brink of economic ruin and 
eventually cost him his job. Drabinsky repeatedly clashed with MCA and the 
wealthy Bronfman family of Canada, another major partner, before his ouster. 
</P>
<P>
The sale of Universal City Cinemas would leave Cineplex Odeon with 1,530 
screens in 390 locations in the United States and Canada. The company, which 
carries about $530 million in long-term debt, recently announced that two of 
its major shareholders, MCA and the Bronfmans' Claridge Investments, might be 
asked to put up $50 million each to help pay off long-terms debts if the 
company cannot comply with its bankers' requirements to sell off $200 million 
in assets by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
Logsdon speculated that MCA/Universal's purchase of the theater complex might 
be a way of helping to pay down Cineplex Odeon's debt without having to make 
the $50-million payment. 
</P>
<P>
Universal City Cinemas was built in 1988 at a cost of $16.5 million. Cineplex 
Odeon is entitled to consider competing offers for the theater complex for the 
next 60 days under the agreement, and MCA/Universal has the option of matching 
a competing offer or leasing its land to a new theater tenant. The sale of the 
complex is also subject to governmental review.

LABOR: DRUG TESTING SAFEGUARDS NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shamefully, the use of illicit drugs in this country supports a 
multibillion-dollar criminal empire ruled by drug lords, and that generally 
accepted fact is bad enough. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bush Administration, in its zeal to attack the problem, has repeatedly 
exaggerated and misused statistics about drug use in the workplace and its 
financial impact. 
</P>
<P>
The hype is leading to a major increase in testing that is not highly reliable. 
That can cause serious problems for workers, who can be fired, or not hired, 
because tests erroneously indicate that they use drugs. Also, testing is 
expensive for employers who pay for it and who can face costly legal action by 
workers falsely accused of taking drugs. 
</P>
<P>
There are ways that testing can be used to combat the problem, but not nearly 
enough is being done to safeguard workers who are tested. 
</P>
<P>
The rush to test workers stems in part from badly flawed studies that were used 
to provide President Bush and federal drug czar William J. Bennett with the 
widely disseminated statistic that drug abuse costs American industry at least 
$60 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
John Horgan, an editor of the authoritative publication, Scientific American, 
ridicules the basic study used to get the estimate, saying it was statistically 
illogical. 
</P>
<P>
The study surveyed 3,700 households in 1982, asking if any member at any time 
had used marijuana daily for at least 20 days in any 30-day period. Households 
with a heavy marijuana user earned 28% less than families with no heavy users. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the big jump to the conclusion that the income difference was caused 
solely by the families' "reduced productivity due to daily marijuana use" at 
some time by at least one family member. 
</P>
<P>
Horgan noted that the difference could have been caused by many other factors, 
such as family size. The more family members, the greater the odds that one may 
have used marijuana, and large families often have low incomes. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which developed the figure, 
acknowledges that it really only showed the potential loss of income to 
families with a drug-using member, not a real loss to American industry. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, to dramatize the extent of the problem, the Administration 
extrapolated the family sample to get a national figure and proclaimed that 
workplace drug use was costing all of American industry $27 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Then that figure was inflated by adding estimated costs of drug-related crimes 
and inflation and population growth since 1982. Up came the frightening 
estimate that workplace drugs today cost American companies $60 billion a year. 
Bush at times rounds the figure off to a neat $100 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Strangely, the same 1982 survey included a question about current drug use. The 
answer, mostly ignored, showed no significant difference between the incomes of 
households with current users of marijuana, cocaine or heroin and incomes of 
households that had no users. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Administration's politically potent scare tactics to increase drug 
testing, we cannot act as though there is no real drug problem. There is. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble comes in the slapdash way that many worried companies try to cope with 
the problem. Finally, however, some -- but not enough -- curbs are being 
applied on the rush to testing. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative California Supreme Court recently let stand lower court 
rulings that, under California's constitutionally protected right of privacy, 
employers cannot fire or otherwise punish workers who refuse to submit to 
random drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
We should hope that other states will follow California's lead, as they often 
do. 
</P>
<P>
As important as the court ruling was, it still allows companies to continue 
giving drug tests to job applicants and those in safety-related jobs. And that 
leaves a large number of workers vulnerable to rejection or dismissal because 
of false test results. 
</P>
<P>
Also, workers can be labeled drug users if they take a legally prescribed 
medicine -- or even a poppy-seed bagel -- that can produce the same test result 
as an illegal substance. 
</P>
<P>
Few employers bother or can afford to offer a second test to check for 
mistakes, although responsible companies avoid those pitfalls by offering 
repeat tests and using only certified, reliable testing companies. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Greenberg at American Management Assn. says 51.5% of all medium-sized and 
large companies already do some kind of testing, and that means that it is more 
urgent than ever for Congress to enact strict safeguards to protect workers 
from abuse by testing. 
</P>
<P>
Limited, non-random testing can assist the war on drugs. But it must be done 
with great care, and government-mandated counseling and drug rehabilitation 
must be offered, with the help of federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
One system that seems sensible, especially for dangerous occupations, was 
negotiated recently by four building trades unions representing 100,000 workers 
and four Southern California construction associations. It provides fairly 
strong safeguards for workers' rights. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, no random testing is allowed, and tests can be required 
only for "reasonable cause" based on evidence of suspicious on-the-job behavior 
observed by a supervisor and a worker or union representative. 
</P>
<P>
Workers who test positive must be given a second test and, if they still 
contend that there has been a mistake, they can appeal through the 
industry-union grievance procedure. 
</P>
<P>
Those who must take the test get it at a facility agreed on by the company and 
union. Those who pass, including job applicants, must be paid for any lost 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Current employees who fail the test can go through a rehabilitation program; if 
they complete it successfully, they are rehired. 
</P>
<P>
Controlled testing is often approved of by workers who can be endangered by 
drug users. Douglas McCarron, head of the carpenters district council, who 
helped negotiate the construction industry testing system for this area, says 
his members overwhelmingly voted for it. 
</P>
<P>
That system, and probably no other, is going to eliminate drug use in the 
workplace. But then the problem isn't nearly as horrendous as the Bush 
Administration contends.

MARKETING: IMAGE CAMPAIGNS TRY TO WIN HEARTS BY SHOWING ANOTHER SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

When the agency that creates ads for Penthouse asked to sit in on some of the 
magazine's story conferences last year, editors were baffled. After all, 
everyone knows what Penthouse is: a magazine filled with pictures of women in 
kinky poses. Who cares what stories are squeezed in between the pictures? 
</P>
<P>
Well, the New York ad agency Smith/Greenland did. 
</P>
<P>
"Penthouse had a problem," said Leo Greenland, chairman of the firm that also 
creates those provocative billboard ads for Johnnie Walker Scotch. "The problem 
wasn't just one of misconception, it was also one of recognition." 
</P>
<P>
Recognition by whom? Advertisers. Ad sales were way off. And scores of major 
advertisers refused to be associated with the magazine. How to change its 
image? Penthouse wasn't about to mess around with its content. But its agency 
decided to promote, in trade journals, the message that Penthouse was also 
doing some investigative journalism. 
</P>
<P>
One print ad about its investigation into the Ku Klux Klan pictured two hooded 
Klan members above the headline "Not everyone under a sheet in Penthouse is in 
the mood for love." Another ad, about its story on the war on drugs, featured a 
picture of a drug bust. The headline: "Some of the biggest busts Penthouse 
uncovers aren't the kind you think they are." 
</P>
<P>
Can an advertising campaign successfully change -- or improve -- the image of a 
product? 
</P>
<P>
"First, there must be credibility with the product itself," said Jeffrey B. 
Hirsch, president of Venice-based Hirsch Marketing. "If the product cannot 
deliver on the new image that the advertiser is trying to communicate, it will 
be doomed to failure." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Penthouse, plenty of other companies have recently unleashed campaigns 
that try to improve their images. Last week, the Wall Street Journal began a 
print campaign in the advertising trade magazines in an effort to convince 
advertisers that its readers aren't just on Wall Street. And for nearly five 
years, Rolling Stone has spent heavily on a tongue-in-cheek campaign that 
relies on contrasting images to convey the message that its readers who once 
made purchases with pockets full of change now flash American Express cards. 
</P>
<P>
During the past year, E&amp;J Gallo Wineries has spent millions on a campaign 
to convince consumers that it can make fine wines. And Club Med is pumping 
millions of dollars into a campaign to inform aging baby boomers that it is no 
longer just a place for swinging singles. 
</P>
<P>
Can these efforts work? Penthouse hasn't done half bad. Its ad campaign is 
about a year old. Although most magazines are seeing substantial dips in ad 
sales, Penthouse linage is up 5.1% for the first half of 1990, compared to the 
same period in 1989. Bear in mind that Playboy has seen an 11.4% drop during 
the same period. 
</P>
<P>
It's a long way from Penthouse to the Wall Street Journal, but the financial 
newspaper has also begun to run ads in which it refers to itself in bold print 
as "the wild and crazy Wall Street Journal." How wild? Well, the ads point out 
that 83% of its subscribers don't even work in the financial field. The ads 
also note that 42% of its subscribers are under age 45. 
</P>
<P>
Since the stock market crash of October, 1987, the Journal has seen a big drop 
in its financial services advertising. And for the first five months of 1990, 
overall ad sales were down 4.6%, compared to the same period in 1989, said 
Kenneth Burenga, senior vice president at Dow Jones. "The campaign says there's 
more to the Wall Street Journal than financial statistics and numbers," said 
Burenga. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the most successful recent image-changing campaign is the one that 
Gallo introduced about a year ago. Using the slogan "It will change the way you 
think about Gallo," the company has invested millions of dollars to convince 
baby boomers that it's no embarrassment to serve Gallo wine. 
</P>
<P>
"The challenge was to convey that message," said Dan Solomon, Gallo's 
communications director. 
</P>
<P>
How to do it? "We had to be believable," said Clifford Einstein, president of 
the Los Angeles agency Dailey &amp; Associates. "It was necessary for us to 
construct our message in a way that showed we understood that this may not have 
been the way people perceived Gallo." 
</P>
<P>
The ads show upwardly mobile couples who, at first, show surprise when Gallo 
wine is served at a gathering. The campaign appears to have succeeded. Gallo 
has quickly become the nation's largest seller of varietal wines. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of advertising is not something we invented," Einstein said. "It's 
classical stuff. The trick is to be consistent, and to do it for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

Carl's Jr. Prepares to Grill Ad Agencies 
</P>
<P>
Carl's Jr. is giving West Coast agencies the chance to swallow its estimated 
$20-million advertising business. 
</P>
<P>
For five years, the Los Angeles office of Della Femina, McNamee WCRS has 
created ads for the Anaheim fast-food chain. Although Della Femina will still 
be part of the review, the company has sent letters announcing the search to a 
number of Southern California agencies, said a Carl's spokeswoman, who declined 
to state a reason for the review. Peter Stranger, president of Della Femina's 
Los Angeles office was unavailable for comment late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dreyfus Campaign Won't Tax Bush 
</P>
<P>
Dreyfus has read George Bush's lips. But it's still not about to poke fun of 
him in its print ad campaign that features photos of Presidents above their 
comments about keeping taxes down. 
</P>
<P>
Some Presidents have succeeded in their promises about taxes -- while others 
failed. And even though Bush last week indicated that the size of the federal 
deficit may require additional taxes, Dreyfus has no plans to add his picture 
to the ad. "It wouldn't be appropriate," said a Dreyfus spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"We created tax-free funds. Then again, we had a lot of inspiration," says the 
headline above the long-running Dreyfus ad that shows mugs of Presidents from 
Dwight Eisenhower to Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Medical Center Picks a New Ad Doctor 
</P>
<P>
When Rick Colby was treated for cancer at UCLA Medical Center, the farthest 
thing from his mind was creating advertising for the center. 
</P>
<P>
Now, 13 years later -- and with his cancer apparently cured -- Colby's Los 
Angeles agency, Larsen Colby Koralek/LHS&amp;B, has won the medical center's ad 
business, which is valued at less than $1 million annually. "When we first went 
over there to pitch the business," Colby said, "they knew I was intimately 
familiar with their facility." 
</P>
<P>
The print campaign is an attempt to change a common misconception that the 
highly regarded medical center is open only to the elite. One new print ad 
shows a stack of medical school textbooks. "Getting to be a UCLA doctor isn't 
easy," the ad says. "Getting an appointment to see one is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Silo Hires Saatchi for L.A. Invasion 
</P>
<P>
Few people in Los Angeles are familiar with the Silo home electronics chain. 
But they soon will be, if the Los Angeles agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi 
DFS/Pacific does its job. 
</P>
<P>
The agency last week won the estimated $5-million advertising business for the 
giant electronics retailer Silo Inc., which plans to open 16 stores in Los 
Angeles during the next year. "By the time we're done with the campaign," said 
Joe Cronin, president of the agency, "we hope as many people know Silo as 
Circuit City." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Schroffel Checks In With Aston Hotels 
</P>
<P>
Schroffel &amp; Associates doesn't offer room service yet, but last week the 
Los Angeles agency picked up its third -- and largest -- hotel client. It won 
the estimated $2-million business for the five Mexican hotel properties of 
Aston Hotels and Resorts. 
</P>
<P>
Schroffel already creates ads for Biltmore and the Lake Arrowhead Hilton. 
Aston, which is best-known for operating condominiums in Hawaii, recently 
expanded into the Mexican cities of Cancun, Cabo San Lucas and Puerto Vallarta. 
</P>
<P>
How big could the account grow? Said Bruce Schroffel, agency president, "They 
plan to eventually be in every resort market in Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Absolut Vodka Puts Own Stamp on Ads 
</P>
<P>
The makers of Absolut Vodka may soon be taking their licks for a new ad. The 
company has inserted a series of stickers -- closely resembling postage stamps 
-- into 400,000 issues of the current issue of New Yorker magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of pictures of famous people, however, these stamps have drawings by 
famous artists of Absolut Vodka bottles. The stamps appear over the headline 
"Absolut First Class." 
</P>
<P>
The key question: Will some people attempt to use these stamps in place of 
legitimate postage? 
</P>
<P>
"To save 25 cents, some people will try anything," said Richard Costello, 
president of the New York agency behind the campaign, TBWA Advertising. "Others 
will probably try it just to see if they can get something past the post 
office."

NATIONAL EDUCATION SETTLES WITH EX-CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
National Education Corp. has agreed to pay H. David Bright, its former chairman 
and chief executive ousted in a management shake-up last year, about $5 million 
in cash and future pension benefits to settle a claim that he was wrongfully 
terminated last year. 
</P>
<P>
The company said Monday that the award, which it would not specify, will all 
but erase a $5.5-million payment National Education will receive from an 
insurance carrier as reimbursement for settlements of several unrelated 
shareholder suits against it. 
</P>
<P>
National Education, the nation's largest provider of vocational education 
services, announced with its insurance carrier the settlements to end 
speculation about the payment to Bright, which has weakened the company's stock 
price. 
</P>
<P>
In light trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, National Education's 
stock closed down 12.5 cents at $5.50 a share. It traded as high as $28 in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Some stock analysts had said that resolving the Bright case could cost the 
ailing company as much as $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
National Education would not discuss the actual value of the severance package, 
calling that a private matter. But Jeffrey Brill, the company's general 
counsel, said the settlement -- part of which will be paid as an increase in 
Bright's pension payments when he reaches age 60 -- will almost nullify the 
effect of the unrelated insurance payment. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate net impact on the company, Brill said, will be a "small positive 
contribution" to National Education's as-yet-unreleased second-quarter results 
because of the insurance payment. The company had already charged the lawsuit 
settlement against its income. 
</P>
<P>
Brill said the company is happy to have resolved the uncertainty over the 
amount of the Bright settlement. "Now we can get back to business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bright, who resides in Newport Beach, could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
National Education operates a nationwide chain of vocational education 
programs, offering both classroom and in-home study. 
</P>
<P>
The company also has textbook and consulting subsidiaries.

NV PHILIPS SEES $1-BILLION LOSS, MAJOR LAYOFFS

<P>
Dutch electronics giant NV Philips, hit by a slump in its worldwide business, 
said Monday that it expects to suffer a huge loss this year and will cut 10,000 
jobs as part of a radical restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
The world's second-largest consumer electronics concern, Philips forecast that 
it will report a net loss of $1.075 billion (2 billion guilders) in calendar 
1990, in contrast with a profit last year of $740 million (1.37 billion 
guilders). 
</P>
<P>
The predicted loss stunned analysts, who had expected NV Philips 
Gloeilampenfabrieken to make a small profit this year in line with the 
company's earlier forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
Its share price slumped nearly 7% to $16.56 (30.80 guilders) on the Amsterdam 
bourse in 30 minutes of hectic trading after the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Timmer, who was formally elected president of Philips on Monday, told an 
extraordinary meeting of shareholders that the company would drastically 
restructure its business by making deep cuts in the total work force of 
290,000. 
</P>
<P>
The company, second only to Japan's Matsushita among global consumer 
electronics concern, has been struggling to make its vast array of products 
profitable. 
</P>
<P>
Although its consumer products, ranging from light bulbs to compact disc 
players, have held up relatively well, some ventures in computers and other 
high-tech areas have done poorly, analysts said.

Executives of Japanese building firms have disbanded a social club to help meet 
U.S. demands for an end to bid rigging in the local construction industry, 
company spokesmen said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-member club had met monthly since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials had voiced suspicions that the meetings, which were closed to 
outsiders, may have included discussions to assign projects to specific 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
The club was disbanded after seven leading members decided to withdraw, the 
Asahi Shimbun national daily reported.

CALARTS MAY TURN DOWN NEA MONEY; 
</P>
<P>
GRANTS: THE VALENCIA ARTS COLLEGE IS CONSIDERING A REJECTION OF FUNDS BECAUSE 
OF THE NO-OBSCENITY PLEDGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deans and the trustees of CalArts ordered a series of what they called 
"emergency meetings" on Monday to decide whether the Valencia arts school 
should reject as much as $250,000 in anticipated grants from the National 
Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by CalArts President Steven Levine, the college said 
the meetings, which began Monday with a gathering of the college's deans, were 
ordered to review the school's posture in the growing protest over the NEA. The 
situation escalated significantly on Friday, when NEA Chairman John E. 
Frohnmayer rejected recommendations for fellowships to four performance artists 
in a move that was widely perceived as an attempt to appease the NEA's 
political critics in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
CalArts said the immediate reason for the review was the offer of a $5,500 
grant from the endowment, but the college said it has pending or anticipated 
grant awards this year totalling $250,000. The arts endowment said Calarts 
received a total of $69,200 last year. 
</P>
<P>
In making the announcement, the Valencia arts college with an enrollment of 
about 900 became the third major academic institution to publicly challenge the 
arts endowment in the growing controversy over restrictions on the kind of work 
the NEA will support. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, UCLA and the University of California system disclosed that they had 
begun active discussions of complete rejection of NEA funding this year -- a 
decision that would affect $1.1 million in grants. Several weeks ago, the New 
School for Social Research in New York City filed a lawsuit to try to block NEA 
use of an anti-obscenity certification required of all grantees. The New School 
turned down $45,000 in NEA grants. 
</P>
<P>
CalArts disclosed its action three days after Frohnmayer overturned grants to 
four politically controversial performance artists that a peer review panel had 
recommended. Levine said deans met for nearly three hours Monday afternoon 
afternoon to discuss possible options in the NEA grant controversy. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, however, Levine said CalArts had "certainly not" signed any 
NEA grant documents that included the anti-obscenity pledge, which critics of 
the NEA and its conservative opponents in Congress have likened to an 
anti-pornography loyalty oath. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three artists caught up in the controversy -- including two whose 
grants were among those rescinded by Frohnmayer -- held a press conference in 
Santa Monica to present an "artist's Declaration of Independence." 
</P>
<P>
The news conference was organized by Tim Miller and John Fleck, who were denied 
grants. It was also attended by performance artist Rachel Rosenthal, who 
received an $11,250 fellowship and then turned the money down over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The Miller declaration characterized Frohnmayer as a "sleazeball appointee" of 
"King George Bush." It asserted that Bush "has conspired to make gay artists, 
artists who are people of color, feminist artists, artists who are dealing with 
AIDS, anyone who speaks their mind in an outraged and clear voice, to be 
considered unsuitable for the cultural support that any democracy should 
provide." 
</P>
<P>
Frohnmayer was said to be in Seattle on Monday to attend a performance of the 
Bolshoi Ballet. Arts groups in the Northwest said they planned to picket the 
performance to focus attention on Frohnmayer's role in the controversy. The 
Bolshoi is performing as part of an arts festival tied to the opening of the 
Goodwill Games in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
In other developments in the arts protest Monday: 
</P>
<P>
* A coalition of arts groups scheduled meetings in New York to discuss a 
proposal by one of the 14 artists who received fellowships on Friday. New York 
performance artist Richard Elovich, who received a $5,000 fellowship, suggested 
that artists who received funding transfer some of the grant money to a pool 
for the four who were rejected. 
</P>
<P>
* A key Republican congressman in the NEA controversy said Frohnmayer's action 
may have taken some of the momentum away from a drive by conservatives to write 
statutory language sharply restricting the NEA. Rep. Tom Coleman (R-Mo.), the 
ranking member of a House subcommittee charged with drafting a bill to extend 
the NEA's legal lifetime, said Frohnmayer's action "will probably soothe some 
of the criticism." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it probably says that those who have been very critical of the 
endowment are finally saying that the old song, 'Anything Goes,' is over at the 
NEA," Coleman said. But he said he did not believe the Frohnmayer action would 
mean the demise of two proposals in Congress specifying restrictive language. 
</P>
<P>
* The director of the New York-based Theater Communications Group, an alliance 
of stage organizations, charged that the NEA crisis had worsened to the point 
that artists' reputations were being tarred en masse in a growing conservative 
campaign that could seriously injure the creative careers of artists in a 
variety of media. Peter Zeisler, the group's director, condemned what he 
characterized as a return, in earnest, to the McCarthy era. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems perfectly clear that, if we continue on this path, we're setting up 
another blacklist," Zeisler said. 
</P>
<P>
The turmoil is a continuation of the NEA controversy that first surfaced in 
April, 1989, in a dispute over endowment support of two controversial 
photography exhibits. The 1989 controversy led to imposition of an 
anti-obscenity clause in the endowment's appropriation bill for this year -- 
the provision that the endowment claims led it to require an anti-obscenity 
certification for each individual grant. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica press conference included statements by Miller and John Fleck, 
a Los Angeles artist who was also among grantees rejected on Friday by 
Frohnmayer. Also attending was Rachel Rosenthal, an internationally acclaimed 
performance soloist who was among the 14 announced fellowship winners but who 
announced over the weekend that she was turning the $11,250 grant down. 
</P>
<P>
The event was also attended by Kedric Wolfe, a performance artist also selected 
for a $6,500 fellowship but who said he is considering rejecting the money, as 
well. Wolfe spoke briefly at the press conference attired in a loincloth 
fashioned from two American flags, carrying a briefcase with a large red button 
on it and with a replica of an atomic bomb suspended from a metal bracket above 
his head. 
</P>
<P>
He described his costume as "the flag, the button and the bomb" and made a 
short speech condemning as more relevant manifestations of obscenity American

REVOLVING DOOR AT KTTV TO SPIN OFF 2 ANCHORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

The revolving door to the Fox-owned KTTV Channel 11 newsroom is spinning once 
again. Both anchors of the station's 10 p.m. news, Dennis Morgino and Pat 
Lalama, will be removed from their positions to make way for new news 
personalities in the next month or two, the station confirmed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
A KTTV spokeswoman said that both Morgino and Lalama, who served as reporters 
at the station before moving "temporarily" to the anchor desk, will be asked to 
stay on at the station. She said KTTV has been shopping around for new anchors 
and hopes to announce at least one new hire by the end of the week. The station 
also plans to make several other on-air changes in coming months, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Since Fox bought KTTV four years ago, change has been nothing new to the 
Channel 11 newsroom. Longtime local anchors Marcia Brandwynne and Tony Cox left 
in the summer of 1987. Network news reporters Bill Redeker and Andrea Naversen 
replaced them; Naversen's contract was bought out after only six months. KNBC 
Channel 4 anchor Kirstie Wilde was lured to KTTV in 1988; she left the station 
on a maternity leave about a year later but did not return. Lalama took over in 
her absence. Then Redeker decided to return to network news last fall. Karl 
Brown held down the weekday job for a few months before giving way to Morgino 
last December. 
</P>
<P>
Changes in news management at the Fox station have also been frequent during 
the last several years. The station has had five news directors since 1987, 
including Joe Saitta, former KCBS Channel 2 news boss Erik Sorenson, Steve 
Blue, Joseph Barnes and Dick Tuininga, who has held the job since May. There 
have also been several managing editors and executive producers during the same 
time period as well as three station chiefs -- Bill White, Robert Morse and 
current chief Greg Nathanson, who has been on the job since October, 1988. Joel 
Cheatwood, KTTV vice president of news and programming, was hired to oversee 
the news operation last February. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Fox takeover, despite the reported active involvement of Fox chairman 
Barry Diller, the station has failed to achieve Diller's stated goal of 
becoming the No. 1 news operation in the Los Angeles market. In the most recent 
ratings period last May, Channel 11 finished a distant second at 10 p.m., a 
good 115,000 homes a night behind longtime independent news champ KTLA Channel 
5. 
</P>
<P>
The ongoing instability at the station has caused newsroom morale to sink, some 
station employees said. Other recent changes include the departures of weekend 
sports anchor Tom Nettles, executive producer Tom Moo, planning director Betsy 
Bates and field producer Stephanie Seldin. A new weatherman, Mark Thompson, is 
scheduled to begin work in about a month. Last summer, in a controversial move, 
the station bought out the contracts of 11 veteran news writers, producers and 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
Tuininga held a recent staff meeting to assure current news staffers that there 
would be no further dismissals, but since then two more news employees have 
lost their jobs, said a KTTV news employee, who asked not to be identified. 
Some staffers are also unhappy with recent directions in the station's news 
content. 
</P>
<P>
"No one feels particularly safe," the employee said. "Everybody's been told to 
take a step back to a kind of keep-it-simple, stupid attitude about (our 
newscasts), which has got everyone feeling offended. The place has been a 
beacon of instability and remains so."

DIRECTORS TACKLE STUDIOS, MEDIA GIANTS OVER CREATIVE RIGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: GENEVA COPYRIGHT CONFERENCE PITS TOP CREATORS AGAINST BIG CORPORATIONS 
AND THE UNITED STATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Proponents of artists' rights in Hollywood are making their case abroad this 
week, in the scenic town of Geneva, Switzerland, where an international 
copyright conference convened Monday. The debate positions some of filmdom's 
biggest creative names against many of the nation's biggest media and 
entertainment corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Directors Guild of America delivered a statement Monday 
that argues for "the right to object" to any defacement of their work -- a 
right they contend that U.S. law does not allow. The directors, as well as 
other members of the creative community, feel they lack the means to challenge 
colorization, editing and other new technological factors that alter the movies 
they created. 
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. government took the position in Geneva that the country already is 
in basic compliance with the Berne Treaty of the World Intellectual Property 
Organization that governs the rights of artists worldwide. According to Dorothy 
Schrader, general counsel for the U.S. Copyright Office, when the Senate 
ratified joining the Berne Treaty in 1988, it acknowledged that existing state 
and federal laws and statutes already provided safeguards for the "moral" 
rights that other nations grant to creators. Schrader is in Geneva this week, 
part of the U.S. delegation headed by Registrar of Copyrights Ralph Oman. 
</P>
<P>
Also attending the conference is Norman Alterman, an executive of the Motion 
Picture Assn. of America, an umbrella group for the major studios. Its 
position, opposite that of the DGA, is essentially the same as the 
government's. 
</P>
<P>
The DGA's decision to take its case to Geneva represents the second major 
effort in as many months by the creative community to bring attention to the 
issue of artists' rights. In a separate move, directors Steven Spielberg and 
Barry Levinson spearheaded a fund-raising drive in May that quickly generated 
$100,000 in campaign contributions for Long Island Rep. Robert Mrazek, a 
champion of artists' rights who faces a tough re-election battle this November. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Bjorklund, a legislative assistant to Mrazek, said the size of the 
contributions (unusually large for any congressional candidate) from Hollywood 
indicates a desire "to send a signal to other members of Congress that there 
are other players in Hollywood -- that it's not just the producers and studios" 
who can lobby, donate money and play the political game. 
</P>
<P>
"The sleeping giant is finally awakening," said Elliott Silverstein, chairman 
of the DGA President's Committee, which is coordinating the guild's effort. 
Silverstein is attending the Geneva conference with DGA executive director 
Glenn Gumpel, and they are working there in tandem with Writers Guild of 
America West Coast executive director Brian Walton and WGA president George 
Kirgo. 
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Europe at the end of last week, Silverstein said the DGA 
would argue that U.S. law isn't enough to meet even the minimal requirements of 
the Berne Treaty. He believes that if other nations adopt model legislation 
detailing artistic rights, it may "pressure Congress to upgrade our laws." The 
main legal deficiency, as the DGA sees it, is that the creative community has 
no status to even file a lawsuit to object to what they see as a "defacement" 
of their work. 
</P>
<P>
"What you're seeing is an alternative point of view emerging," he added. 
</P>
<P>
The artists' "alternative point of view," however, runs counter to that of many 
of the companies that employ them -- the major motion picture studios. 
</P>
<P>
The efforts by the DGA and the political fund-raising by such directors as 
Spielberg and Levinson also upsets the conventional wisdom that only the 
producers and monied executives have political clout. Further, these efforts 
are reviving the centuries-old confrontation between art and commerce. In this 
case, who controls the fate of finished motion pictures -- the artists who 
create them, or those who pay for their production? 
</P>
<P>
Among the contributors to Spielberg and Levinson's pitch for Democrat Mrazek 
were such major talents as Woody Allen, Warren Beatty, Francis Coppola, Tom 
Cruise, David Geffen, Dustin Hoffman, George Lucas, Michael Ovitz, Sidney 
Pollack, Rob Reiner, Martin Scorsese, Don Simpson and Bob Zemeckis. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side is a Washington-based lobby known as the Committee for 
America's Copyright Community, formed in early 1989. According to Michael R. 
Klipper, counsel for CACC, its members include such powerful industry groups as 
the MPAA, the National Association of Broadcasters, the Recording Industry 
Assn. of America, the Assn. of American Publishers, and such corporations as 
Time Warner, Times Mirror, Turner Broadcasting, McGraw-Hill and Harcourt Brace 
Jovanovich. 
</P>
<P>
The issue comes down to a matter of "corporate greed," Spielberg charged at a 
luncheon he and Levinson gave at the Creative Artists Agency for Mrazek. "Who 
controls the future of a piece of art? What's to stop Ted Turner from turning 
'Gone With the Wind' into a rock opera?" Spielberg said that with the rapidity 
that technology is changing show business, there no doubt will always be 
as-yet-unknown ways that movies can be altered. "I used to trade on technology 
to make my movies more effective. Now I fear technology because it is going to 
make my movies more defective," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The director cited advances in the technology of colorization, panning and 
scanning, and time compression (speeding up a film to fit it into a specific TV 
time slot). 
</P>
<P>
"For all the power I think I have, I don't own the negatives to my films," 
Spielberg added, noting that his own success allows him to speak out against 
the positions of many companies and executives he's worked for. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no rights now," Levinson said. "(Movies can) become no more than a 
canvas to be altered and we have no right to object." 
</P>
<P>
The campaign contributions came flowing because, as Spielberg noted, it's no 
easy task to buck the existing copyright laws and the forces that maintain 
them. Mrazek and others in Congress have tried, but without much success. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Rep. Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) made a splash in Hollywood during his 
bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. He dabbled a bit in the 
anti-colorization efforts of the moment. He even appeared with Woody Allen at a 
Capitol Hill press conference. But the creative community's support of his 
candidacy remained limited. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, in the face of strong opposition from many of the same corporations 
who now form the backbone of the Committee for America's Copyright Community, 
Gephardt let the issue slide. When he was accused of using the 
anti-colorization drive as a way to attract Hollywood money, The Times quoted 
him as saying, "The idea that this was a political effort is completely 
wrongheaded. It probably has hurt my efforts," because, he suggested, many 
studio chiefs and others are opposed to it. 
</P>
<P>
Mrazek's chief of staff, Tom Barry, speculated that Los Angeles-area members of 
Congress haven't had a high profile on the issue because "they have 
constituents on both sides of the issue. (In Long Island) we don't have a 
constituent economic interest." 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Mrazek, with the help of Rep. Sid Yates (D-Ill.), sponsored 
legislation creating the National Film Preservation Act, which became law in 
1988. For the first time, it provided government recognition of movies as an 
art form. It granted special status for the designation of 25 vintage films 
each year to be added to a roster of "protected" works. If they are colorized 
in any format, they must be labeled as such. 
</P>
<P>
Most attempts at "moral rights" legislation have failed. One case in 1988 
attempted to amend the U.S. Copyright Act to grant authors and creators the 
rights of "paternity" and "integrity." The proposal, known as the Berne 
Convention Implementation Act, was intended to bring the United States into 
conformity with the Berne Convention Treaty. Portions of the act were adopted 
but not the specific moral rights or artists' rights wording that the 
directors' and writers' guilds would have liked. However, the legislation was 
sufficient to allow the U.S. to become a signatory to Berne. 
</P>
<P>
Following the 1988 debate, the Committee for America's Copyright Community was 
formed to represent producers, studios and publishers. 
</P>
<P>
In a position paper, the CACC contended that it is the economic incentives 
given by producers to authors and creators that "encourages the creation and 
dissemination of new works." 
</P>
<P>
While the committee opposes changing the copyright laws that cover so-called 
"works for hire," it is neither for nor against the Visual Artists Rights Act 
of 1990, sponsored by Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier(D-Wis.) and Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy (D-Mass.), which is pending in the Senate (and already passed by the 
House). 
</P>
<P>
CACC's counsel Klipper said that the proposed act would grant "attribution and 
integrity" rights to artists for limited-edition and single-copy works -- "a 
very narrow category," he added. 
</P>
<P>
But that's a distinction the DGA and the contributors to Mrazek would not find 
relevant. 
</P>
<P>
"This effort is about respect for film as an art form," Levinson said. "We 
don't want finished films changed. They (the CACC) feel film can be recycled . 
. . the CACC doesn't want to lose rights because films have proven to be 
reusable in whole new frontiers."

A PREVIEW OF COMING ATTRACTIONS FOR THE FOURTH OF JULY; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: FIVE HOLIDAY MARATHONS ARE ON TAP FOR VIEWERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It used to be that making plans for the Fourth of July was pretty simple: Where 
should we go for fireworks? Hot dogs or hamburgers? Which John Philip Souza 
march should we cue up this year? But these days many local residents have been 
seduced into adding another decision to their Independence Day rituals: Which 
TV marathon should we watch? 
</P>
<P>
There are five marathons to ponder this year: 
</P>
<P>
* KTLA Channel 5 presents its traditional "The Twilight Zone" festival from 9 
a.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
* KDOC Channel 56 has 23 episodes of the old "Bob Newhart Show" beginning at 9 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
* KCET Channel 28 will air 10 hours of the historical series "The American 
Experience." 
</P>
<P>
* "Ha!" the cable comedy channel will play 24-hours of "Love American Style" 
beginning at 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
* KCOP Channel 13 will show nine uncut movies including "On the Waterfront," 
"West Side Story" and "Bonnie and Clyde" without any commercial interruptions 
the entire day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a holiday gift to our viewers," said Rick Feldman, KCOP's station 
manager. Feldman explained that the idea behind these holiday marathons, which 
KTLA originated on Thanksgiving Day, 1980, is to accommodate all the working 
people who ordinarily are not home to watch television during the week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a way to bring viewers to the set who are only around because they have 
the day off," he said. "So you try to create something that is different to 
pull them in. With regular daytime programming, it's tough to find a 
promotional hook." 
</P>
<P>
On past holidays, KCOP has aired four Woody Allen movies with commercials. This 
time, Feldman said, the station has decided to suffer a six-figure financial 
hit by blowing out all commercials from midnight tonight to 10 p.m. Wednesday 
so that viewers can enjoy these American-themed movies without any 
interruptions. In order, the station will air Marlon Brando in "On the 
Waterfront," "Now, Voyager" with Bette Davis and Claude Rains, Philip Kaufman's 
astronaut saga "The Right Stuff," John Wayne in "The Alamo," "The Music Man" 
with Robert Preston and Shirley Jones, "West Side Story" with Natalie Wood, "A 
Star Is Born" starring Judy Garland and James Mason, Howard Hawks' "Red River" 
and "Bonnie and Clyde" with Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway. 
</P>
<P>
The station will broadcast 90-second breaks between each movie that will 
include a trailer for the upcoming film plus promotions for some of the 
station's own upcoming programs. 
</P>
<P>
KTLA invented this sort of promotional hook on Thanksgiving Day, 1980, to take 
advantage of the unusually large male and school-age holiday audience. It 
dusted off the cult classic series "The Twilight Zone" and has been airing it 
ever since. On July 4, 1982, KTLA inaugurated another tradition with an all-day 
marathon of "Star Trek." The following year, KTLA switched over to another 
holiday's worth of "Twilight Zone" episodes and Rod Serling has been popping up 
on the half-hour every Thanksgiving and Independence Day since. 
</P>
<P>
"We're usually the No. 1 station in the market on these days," said Mark 
Sonnenberg, KTLA's director of programming. He said ratings for the station, 
especially during the daytime hours, are up to 50% higher than usual, making 
these marathons a financial bonanza. Sonnenberg said that advertising revenue 
is generally down during the summer months, but the Fourth of July marathons 
have enabled the station to attract advertisers on a day that would otherwise 
be a tough sell. The marathon also enables the station to promote some of its 
own regular programs to a large audience that normally would not be watching 
the station during these hours. 
</P>
<P>
This year's marathon consists of 22 of the 154 total "Twilight Zone" episodes, 
including four rarely seen hourlong programs. Sonnenberg said that viewers call 
the station days in advance asking for the list of episodes the station plans 
to air. Some viewers even go to the station to obtain their own list. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone has their favorite episodes, and it's fun to watch the big stars like 
Robert Redford in some of their earliest roles," Sonnenberg said. "But another 
reason it works so well is that each show is only half an hour and people can 
come in and out of them throughout the day. You can watch one show, go out, 
come back, watch another one, maybe switch over to (sports), and if that gets 
boring, you can switch back to another 'Twilight Zone.' Movies take too long 
with all the things people have going on during a holiday." 
</P>
<P>
Feldman concedes that no one will watch all nine movies on KCOP, but he does 
believe people will be eager to block out two hours to watch one of these films 
without commercials. "Sure people will be going to the beach, but they might 
come home at 4 p.m. and then they can sit down and watch a movie," he said. 
</P>
<P>
KCET's marathon takes the Independence Day theme to heart as all the "American 
Experience" films focus on some event or time period from the nation's past. 
The festival, which runs from 7 a.m. to noon, 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. to 11 
p.m., is organized so that each episode will present a different regional, 
political and philosophical point of view. 
</P>
<P>
Among the topics covered by these documentaries are the life of cowboys, 
baseball's place in American culture, the first around-the-world air race in 
1924, the underground railroad, Eric Sevareid's experiences as a radio 
correspondent in 1930s Europe, Prohibition, the Sears catalogue, the struggles 
for Native American rights and European immigration to the United States. "The 
Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter," the award-winning film that profiles the 
lives of women workers during World War II, will be screened at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The point of all these marathons? Station identity. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one more thing your station is known for," Sonnenberg said. "When you 
think of Thanksgiving, you think, the 'Twilight Zone' is going to be on. And as 
you're getting ready for your picnic on the Fourth of July, someone will make 
some reference to it. As you look at the growing fragmentation of TV with more 
and more channels and cable choices, it's more and more crucial to have close 
ties to viewers. In addition to the Rose Parade and the Angels, 'Twilight Zone' 
marathons are what KTLA is known for."

DEUTSCHEMARK REMAINS STRONG AND GERMAN STOCK INDEX RISES

<TEXT>
<P>
The deutschemark remained strong Monday in closely watched trading sessions 
that followed the powerful currency's introduction into East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said the mark also was strengthened by the possibility of U.S. 
tax increases to combat an American deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The mark was fixed at 1.6538 to the dollar in Frankfurt, up from 1.6715 marks 
on Friday. In London, the mark was pegged at 1.6535 to the dollar, up from 
1.6635 marks on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The stock market in Frankfurt on Monday also reacted favorably to the first 
business day of economic union: The German stock index climbed to 1,912.58 from 
1,879.90 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Dealers remained optimistic that the West German stock market could be set for 
a continued rising trend if the economic union progresses smoothly enough to 
keep the inflation rate down. 
</P>
<P>
Although markets were steady to improved, one dealer cautioned that warning 
strikes at some East German factories on Monday could be troubling to currency 
and stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany sent 25 billion marks ($15.1 billion) from its national bank's 
cash reserves of new bills to cover the initial phase of economic unification. 
No new money had to be printed to cover the project.

President-elect Alberto Fujimori won a round in his battle to reopen the 
foreign aid flow by securing Japan's pledge to send an economic cooperation 
mission to Peru. "Mr. Kaifu clearly understood our economic problems," Fujimori 
told reporters in Tokyo after meeting Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. 
Japanese officials said Kaifu also promised to send a group of economic 
advisers to help the Lima government draw up a retrenchment strategy. The

New York lawmakers finished action Monday on a bill declaring "the emerald 
green Empire spring mineral water bottle of Saratoga shall be the official 
bottle of the state of New York." 
</P>
<P>
If Gov. Mario M. Cuomo signs the measure, the state bottle will join the state 
muffin (apple), state flower (rose), bird (bluebird), animal (beaver), fish 
(trout) and gem (garnet) among New York's official symbols. 
</P>
<P>
The "Empire" bottle was manufactured in the Upstate New York village of 
Congressville in the 1880s. It is a common collector's item today, with a 
reported market value of $25 to $35.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: FOOTHILL TIES EXPECTED LOSS TO JUNK BONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Foothill Group said it expects to report a second-quarter loss of between $3.8 
million and $4.3 million because it wrote down its investment portfolio to 
reflect falling values for its junk-bond holdings. 
</P>
<P>
Foothill, a financial services concern with executive offices in Agoura Hills 
and Los Angeles, said the writedown would result in an after-tax charge of 
about $5.4 million in the quarter ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter of 1989, Foothill had a profit of $3.24 million. 
</P>
<P>
The writedown was needed "due to the continuing price erosion" in the market 
for junk bonds, Foothill said, referring to the high-yield, high-risk debt 
securities that have fallen out of favor with investors over the past year.

AIRPORT BACKER DOESN'T HIDE STAKE IN PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the past six months, a private booster group has emerged in Orange 
County, giving influential backing to a proposed international airport in 
neighboring San Bernardino County, connected to Anaheim by a high-speed rail 
system. 
</P>
<P>
But while the group, Transportation Alternatives for Southern California, has 
touted the public benefits of such a system, less well known are the stakes for 
TASC's co-founder and patron, Newport Beach developer William Buck Johns. 
</P>
<P>
Johns, a charismatic businessman and prominent Republican Party fund-raiser, 
told The Times on Monday that his company is a joint venture partner in a plan 
to develop 85 acres near Hesperia, about 25 miles from the proposed airport and 
just a few miles from the proposed rail route. The company also holds millions 
of dollars in other property that could benefit indirectly from construction of 
the transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
"I damn well better make money up there," Johns said in a lengthy interview 
Monday, "or my wife's going to be irritable." 
</P>
<P>
Johns says he has made no secret of his property holdings in San Bernardino and 
Riverside counties, either to the TASC, which he co-founded last year with 
Costa Mesa Mayor Peter F. Buffa, or to government officials. But some say they 
have been surprised to learn of Johns' ample financial stake. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley said he did not learn of Johns' personal interest 
until after the supervisors heard a lengthy presentation from Buffa last month 
and then voted to endorse the San Bernardino airport site. 
</P>
<P>
"After that meeting, I was patting Peter on the back for being such a good 
citizen, and then I followed up later and discovered this about Buck," Riley 
said. "I was certainly surprised and a little concerned. It made me wonder 
about what they were telling us." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Riley nor any other officials questioned the legality of lobbying for 
the airport and rail. Many, in fact, were highly supportive of the group, 
arguing that only the private sector and profit motive could ever make the 
transportation project succeed. 
</P>
<P>
Since founding TASC, Johns and Buffa have toured widely to make that happen. 
They have painstakingly developed a snazzy presentation touting the airport and 
high-speed rail system, complete with laser pointers, lighted maps, aerial 
photographs and artists' renderings. 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't been cheap -- Johns says it has cost him a "bloody ton" -- but as it 
has perfected its pitch, TASC has become what some experts consider the 
region's most important private clearinghouse for information on transportation 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
It's also attracted an all-star group of advisers: In addition to Young, TASC's 
17-member advisory council bristles with local politicians and luminaries, 
including astronaut Buzz Aldrin and former U.S. Treasurer Angela Bay Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
What's not part of TASC's presentation or its statement of purpose is Johns' 
personal interest in the projects. When asked about them, however, the 
developer makes no effort to conceal his investments, and in fact Johns' 
interests have been noted in rail stories in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not bashful about stating that I'm in the land development business," 
Johns said. "This is not some kind of altruistic message. My motives are 
simple: I'm trying to make a profit." 
</P>
<P>
San Bernardino land records show that in April, a month after Johns returned 
from a trip to Europe during which he and other backers of high-speed rail 
reviewed potential systems, papers were filed to complete a deal for 85 acres 
of undeveloped Hesperia land. He paid $600,000 for the property, records show. 
</P>
<P>
Johns said he sold the land to a joint venture on June 1 for the same amount 
that he paid for it. That joint venture, in which Johns' company is a partner, 
will in turn sell the land to a home builder, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Much farther from the proposed airport, the Inland Group is developing about 30 
projects in Moreno Valley and Beaumont that would benefit indirectly from 
construction of the rail, Johns says. 
</P>
<P>
Although he says he has never made any secret of the holdings, Johns cannot 
recall discussing the subject directly with any supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Don R. Roth, the leading airport backer and one of several 
supervisors to receive modest campaign contributions from the Inland Group, 
also denied knowing of the developer's land holdings. Roth and Johns, longtime 
friends, were on the European trip, and copies of Roth's appointment books show 
that he met with Johns or Buffa five times during the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
But Roth says Johns' personal interest in the San Bernardino project, which 
would be built on what is now George Air Force Base, never came up. "I've never 
had any discussions with him about this in my life," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
Among the relatively small group of officials who say they are aware of Johns' 
financial stake in the airport's development, his involvement has generated 
spirited debate. Backers admire the group's free enterprise edge -- including 
Johns' profit motive -- and see it as an overdue private sector entrance into 
an area long bungled by local governments. 
</P>
<P>
Others express concern, however, raising questions about whether Johns' 
interest in the two projects might lead TASC to back transportation 
alternatives that benefit the Inland Group, regardless of whether they are in 
the public's best interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is something that Peter and Buck will have to struggle with," 
said Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young, a member of the TASC Advisory Council. 
"It's a legitimate question to ask who's involved and what their motives are, 
and will that prevent objective dialogue from taking place." 
</P>
<P>
Johns responds that he is not promoting "objective dialogue." Far from it, he 
says: "This is an advocacy group." 
</P>
<P>
Other advisory group members, including Nixon Library Director Hugh Hewitt and 
Orange County Transportation Commission Chairman Dana Reed, agreed, saying they 
saw nothing wrong with the group or Johns' role in promoting the transportation 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
Buffa, who shares a suite of Newport Beach offices with Johns but says he has 
no personal stake in construction of the airport or rail, also defends TASC and 
Johns. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't see any problem with Buck's arrangement," he said. "He would 
benefit because he does have some interest in the high desert, and the airport 
will enhance the value of that area, but we're not trying to set up a new 
Department of Transportation. This is a private group, and there's a profit 
motive involved in this." 
</P>
<P>
The exact extent of Johns' personal stake in the airport's development is 
impossible to quantify, although Johns supplied maps of his projects and noted 
that most are far from the proposed facility. Real estate experts agree that 
speculation is already driving up land values in the high desert and that 
transportation improvements could ease the bottlenecks that threaten to thwart 
future escalation of property values throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
Land in and around Adelanto, the town abutting the base, has increased in value 
from about $5,000 an acre last year to as high as $500,000 an acre today, 
according to some area real estate agents. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Chu, who runs the Adelanto real estate company of Marconi and Chu, said 
reports of the airport and bullet train have sent local land prices into a 
steep upward spiral. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not so long ago that you could buy land near here for $5,000 an acre," 
Chu said. "That is very rare now. Today you pay $10,000 minimum, and most often 
it is much more -- $100,000 is not unusual." 
</P>
<P>
Some officials are concerned that the speculation could cost taxpayers in the 
end. If the airport is built, state and local governments may have to help 
acquire about 12,000 acres on the base's periphery, and they will have to pay 
fair market value for that land. 
</P>
<P>
Unless a private company agrees to build the airport itself and buy the land 
adjoining it, a possibility that boosters hope for, that could leave taxpayers 
shouldering part of the cost of buying out real estate speculators at the 
inflated land values. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just going out of the ballpark," said Ed Dondelinger, Adelanto's mayor. 
"Every time anyone mentions the airport, the prices jump again, and in the end, 
we're going to end up paying for that." 
</P>
<P>
Johns does not own any property in the airport's immediate vicinity, but says 
it's not for lack of trying. 
</P>
<P>
"I am attempting, have tried to and hopefully will soon have property in 
Adelanto," he said. "The price up there is just too high right now." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Johns and TASC are continuing to lobby for the conversion of 
George Air Force Base to a commercial airport and for the high-speed rail to 
serve it. With Johns' political influence and TASC's growing prominence, 
officials say the project has powerful backing. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see anything wrong with what Buck's doing," said Ken Delino, deputy 
city manager of Newport Beach. "Buck Johns and Peter Buffa have become the

Still, local leaders insist that neither Johns' political connections nor 
TASC's enthusiasm will translate into special treatment. And some argue that 
the personal interests of land developers -- not the public involvement of 
governments -- are what ultimately will make the project a success. 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you realize that there's a personal interest in an issue, that 
naturally adds an overlay of greater caution so that you make sure you're not 
seeing things through rose-colored glasses," said Supervisor Roger R. Stanton. 
"But I don't think we're going to get private sector involvement without some 
profit motive. That's what's going to get them interested, not altruism."

ASIANS PROTEST CENSUS FOLLOW-UP PROCEDURES; 
</P>
<P>
MINORITIES: A PLAN TO LUMP THEM WITH WHITES IN A DOOR-TO-DOOR POST-ENUMERATION 
SURVEY IS UNDER REVIEW, OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>

<P>
Census officials, reacting to criticism from Asian community leaders, said 
Monday that they will consider modifying a post-census survey in hopes of more 
accurately tabulating the nation's Asian population. 
</P>
<P>
Asian leaders from the San Francisco Bay Area to Orange County have decried the 
so-called "post-enumeration survey," saying it will ignore their community at a 
time when Asians are the fastest-growing ethnic group in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The post-enumeration survey, scheduled to begin this month, is designed to 
assure that minority groups and the poor are not undercounted in the nearly 
completed U.S. census. 
</P>
<P>
The study is to be based on door-to-door interviews with 150,000 households, 
the results of which will be compared to completed census forms for those same 
households. Discrepancies will be noted and used to determine if members of 
minority groups or those who fall within certain income levels were 
undercounted. 
</P>
<P>
The criticism arose because Asians, while listed separately on the survey 
forms, were to be grouped together with whites in the study. Los Angeles 
officials have estimated that Asians were undercounted by 7.3% in the 1980 
census. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last decade Asian-Americans have fought two presidential 
administrations to ensure a correct count," Secretary of State March Fong Eu 
said Monday at a press conference in Los Angeles. "Now the Asian community is 
back at ground zero." 
</P>
<P>
Monterey Park Mayor Judy Chu, who joined Eu at the press conference, said: 
"There's absolutely no justification to exclude Asians. In fact, there's even 
more justification to include us. Immigrants are not familiar with the 
census-taking process and may have undercounted family members." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert Matsui (D-Sacramento) and Rep. Norman Mineta (D-San Jose) also have 
criticized the study and, last week, joined with about a dozen other members of 
Congress to sign a letter of protest directed at the Commerce Department and 
the Census Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Before their announcement Monday, census officials had defended their policy, 
claiming that Asians are such a small percentage of the U.S. population that 
the post-census count cannot determine if they have been undercounted. Under 
the bureau's current plan, blacks and Latinos would be included in separate 
categories in the count. Anglos, Asians, Pacific Islanders and American Indians 
who do not live on reservations would be in a third category. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Charles Jones, associate director of the Census Bureau, said the 
bureau would "look at" changing its study as the result of telephone calls and 
letters demanding that Asians be counted accurately. "I can't promise anything 
right now . . . but it's certainly feasible to look at that and see if we can 
(count Asians) separately" in the post-census count, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Asian community has burgeoned with an influx of Chinese, Vietnamese and 
Cambodian immigrants to the San Gabriel Valley, Orange County and the San 
Francisco Bay Area. Asians and Pacific Islanders make up about 9.5% of 
California's 29 million residents, according to 1989 Department of Finance 
estimates. Blacks make up 7.5%, and Latinos 24.2%, of the state population. 
</P>
<P>
Population statistics have long been disputed in Orange County, where tens of 
thousands of Southeast Asian immigrants have settled since the last census, 
along with perhaps a dozen other Asian ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the state Department of Finance pegged the county's Southeast 
Asian refugee population at 57,548 in January, but Asian-American community 
leaders believe that the Vietnamese population alone tops 100,000, with up to 
15,000 Cambodians and 10,000 Laotians. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been trying to tell everybody that there are more Asians here than 
people think, that Asians are not being counted in this county," said Vora Huy 
Kanthoul, associate director of the United Cambodian Community Inc. of Santa 
Ana. "We keep receiving the answer that we're exaggerating the numbers. . . . 
But no one is sure of the real number." 
</P>
<P>
Though several Cambodian-speaking census workers were hired, Kanthoul believes 
that there was still a massive undercount. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard," he said. "It's a hassle and our people do not see the direct 
benefits." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Census Bureau agrees to change its way of conducting the 
post-census count, it is unclear whether the results will be used to adjust 
final census figures. Census officials said they have made no decision on how 
and whether the count will be used despite demands by officials in California, 
Chicago, Houston, New York and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
City and state officials there charge that the Commerce Department failed to 
live up to a court-sanctioned agreement that spells out the conditions under 
which the census would be adjusted to correct for undercounted populations. 
</P>
<P>
The cities and states argued in a 1988 lawsuit that they stand to lose millions 
of dollars in federal funds as a result of undercounted minorities and the 
poor. These critics contend that many members of minority groups and the poor 
tend to avoid the census because of language barriers, ignorance or distrust of 
authorities. Latino and black civil rights organizations also were plaintiffs 
in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
In the settlement with the Commerce Department last year, Los Angeles officials 
assumed Asians would be counted as a separate group in the post-enumeration 
survey, said Deputy City Atty. Jessica Heinz.

8 SUSPECTS ENTER NOT GUILTY PLEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight people accused of fatally shooting an undercover Fullerton police officer 
during a June 21 drug sting operation pleaded not guilty Monday to charges of 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
The suspects, seven men and a woman, entered the pleas during arraignment 
Monday afternoon in Downey Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
All eight were ordered back to Los Angeles County Jail, where they are being 
held without bail in connection with the June 21 killing of Officer Tommy De La 
Rosa. A preliminary hearing in the case was scheduled for Sept. 5 in Downey 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
De La Rosa, 43, was killed in an ambush as he attempted to sell $4 million 
worth of cocaine in a "reverse sting" operation. 
</P>
<P>
The eight suspects gave addresses in Orange and Los Angeles counties. Police 
said the eight, apparently not realizing De La Rosa was an undercover 
policeman, conspired to rob and kill the officer. 
</P>
<P>
Those charged are Omar Yuriar Noriega, 23; Raul Meza, 49; Jerome Leon Sanchez, 
29; Jesus Rodriguez Pena, 22; Ydalvys Escobar, 38; Luis Plantillas Benetez, 37; 
Miguel Leon Escobar, 34, and Frederico Edward Marriott.

BATTLE OF BROADWAY TREES BEING FOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever hear of a group of residents who wanted traffic to be clogged in their 
neighborhood, or folks who wanted the city to remove traffic lights to make the 
traffic flow a little more unbearable? 
</P>
<P>
That's the thinking of a small group of residents on historic Broadway in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
They are trying nearly anything to preserve the traditional flavor of their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Broadway and Area Residents was formed after the city cut down 70-year-old oak 
and ash trees on the north side of the thoroughfare. The group, now 85 members 
strong, is committed to preserving the south side's traditional beauty. 
</P>
<P>
The city has proposed widening the street to unclog traffic by razing the trees 
on the south side. But the residents hope that a narrower street -- even one 
without existing traffic signals -- eventually would send frustrated drivers 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
They succeeded in persuading the City Council to postpone the 
street-improvement project until differences and misunderstandings about why 
the trees on the north side were felled could be ironed out. 
</P>
<P>
Now, accord on the fate of the south side is said to be near. On Monday, the 
group and city officials met for nearly three hours, discussing options that 
they hope to transform into a livable solution by next week. 
</P>
<P>
The options include felling the trees and planting smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
But some in the group are not ready to accept felling the trees at any cost. 
Many are older residents who are emotionally attached to the trees, and who say 
they will not live long enough to see the young trees reach full size. LISA

BULK OF HUD FUNDS TO GO FOR HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city has received $1.2 million in federal funds which it will use mainly 
for housing rehabilitation, Oak View-area street improvements and social 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council allocated the largest slice of the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development funds, $372,072, for housing rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Another $200,000 will go toward improving curbs, gutters, lighting and other 
improvements in the blighted Oak View area, a chief focus in the city's 1990-91 
spending plan. In addition, $99,680 of the grant money will go toward Operation 
Logos, an Oak View-area youth employment program. 
</P>
<P>
About $167,550 will be divided among 18 social programs. The top grant 
recipient is the Huntington Beach Community Clinic, a low-cost health center, 
which will get $30,000. The Legal Aid Society, which provides legal assistance 
for low-income residents, will receive $27,000. 
</P>
<P>
City officials originally had planned to earmark $20,000 of the funds for a 
planned homeless shelter, which would be the city's first. However, council 
members, at the urging of Councilman Don MacAllister, trimmed the shelter 
contribution to $12,500, funneling the other $7,500 instead to the Huntington 
Beach Boys and Girls Club. 
</P>
<P>
MacAllister said he opposed allocating the full $20,000 for the shelter because 
he is not convinced that firm plans are in place for the temporary housing 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Jim Miller, who operates other homeless shelters in Orange County, 
said he has tentative plans to set one up in Huntington Beach for $20,000. 
MacAllister said that once Miller submits official plans for the shelter, he 
will back the council in reallocating block-grant funds to replace the $7,500. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining 1990-91 HUD funds will be distributed among Project 
Self-Sufficiency, a single-parents aid program; the Fair Housing Council; 
land-use enforcement; administration costs and a contingency fund.JOHN PENNER

CITY ORDERS REMOVAL OF 2ND-STORY UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council on Monday ordered a builder to remove the upper story of four 
apartments in a complex under construction that has pitted developer against 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
The order was intended as a compromise after the developer and his neighbors 
failed to reach agreement on the project. 
</P>
<P>
In a 3-2 vote, the council ordered that the upper story be removed from the 
four rear apartments of the nearly completed 11-unit, 2 1/2-story complex on 
Pasadena Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel these modifications will address the residents' concerns," Councilwoman 
Leslie Anne Pontious said. 
</P>
<P>
But several residents said they now plan to consult attorneys to try to stop 
the project, and one resident yelled after the vote: "I'll see you in court!" 
</P>
<P>
And Councilman Jim Potts said the city probably would be sued by developer 
Feridoun Rezai no matter what they did. 
</P>
<P>
Work on the project stopped several months ago when neighbors to the rear of it 
complained that it overshadowed their homes, robbed them of their privacy and 
lowered their property values. 
</P>
<P>
The city revoked an existing building permit when staff members discovered that 
17 property owners had not received notice about the project. 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the project fell to the City Council after two meetings between 
Rezai and neighbors failed to produce a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
On April 30, the Planning Commission denied a new permit for the project, but 
Rezai appealed the decision. Rezai's attorney, Joel Ward, said his client is 
losing $1,000 a day while the project remains uncompleted. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Earl J. Prescott on Monday favored denial of a building permit for 
the complex, and he apologized to neighbors that the council hadn't acted at 
its last meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Had we called for the vote last time, most likely the vote would have been 2 
to 2 and the appeal would have been denied," Prescott said. Councilman Charles 
E. Puckett, who was absent at the last council meeting, broke the tie 
Monday.SHANNON SANDS

SCHOOLS FACE A LATINO CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to a sharp increase in the number of Spanish-speaking students, the 
school district is expanding a program to integrate them into city schools. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, the number of students in the district's 
English-as-a-Second-Language program has jumped from 20 to 183, said schools 
Supt. Dennis Smith. As a result, the district has encouraged teachers to take 
special classes and has pulled Latino parents into the program. In the fall, 
the ESL program will be expanded to meet the growing need at a cost of $82,050, 
more than $27,000 over last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've really just turned the system around with regard to what we're doing for 
ESL students," Smith said. The increase in Spanish-speaking students, he said, 
"isn't something we anticipated, and we don't know where it will lead us, 
actually. 
</P>
<P>
While the number of ESL students in Laguna Beach is small compared to other 
Orange County school districts, Smith said it represents a significant and 
growing percentage of the city's school population. Laguna Beach, with 2,200 
students in its four schools, is the smallest unified school district in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
The newest addition to the growing ESL program is a parent advisory group 
intended to encourage family participation. Some Latino parents also are taking 
English lessons in the evening, Smith said. Teachers are being encouraged to 
take Spanish lessons and classes on the Latino culture, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Both parents and students have been "very responsive and very appreciative," 
said Robert Klempen, program supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been an emerging population, and we've really geared up to try to 
help these people," Klempen added. 
</P>
<P>
Among the problems faced by school officials is the higher dropout rate among 
non-English-speaking students, the difficulties of translating lessons into 
Spanish and the frustration of teachers struggling with new skills. 
</P>
<P>
"They're excited but a little frustrated, I think, at the same time," Klempen 
said. "You don't learn Spanish in two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Smith said, the schools are experiencing success in bringing 
Spanish-speaking youngsters into the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
"Success is when we see they are not longtimers or lifers in a program," he 
said. "The intent isn't to teach them in Spanish. It's to teach them in English 
but to use their own native tongue to assist them."LESLIE EARNEST

FUNERAL SATURDAY FOR REV. RAYMOND NICKEL

Funeral services will be held Saturday for the Rev. Raymond Louis Nickel, who 
founded Orange County's first Lutheran Church in America. Nickel died of 
prostate cancer and kidney failure Friday at FHP Hospital in Fountain Valley. 
He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
After serving at two churches in Ohio, Nickel moved to Santa Ana in 1951 to 
start United Lutheran Church, the first of the Lutheran Church in America 
congregations in the county. By 1988, the county had 13 such congregations. 
</P>
<P>
When the family moved from Ohio, it lived "pretty much on a shoestring," said 
Nickel's son, John R. Nickel. "They ate on beans for weeks. He always put the 
church's needs first," he said. 
</P>
<P>
For its first few years, the church operated out of a women's club in Santa 
Ana. In 1953, United Lutheran Church was completed at 1416 S. Bristol St. in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Although the church started with fewer than 10 families, it grew to about 300 
families during the Vietnam War, John Nickel said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very traditional type of church," he said, adding that many military 
families joined the church during the Vietnam War. Since then, as more families 
moved to South County, membership dwindled. 
</P>
<P>
The Lutheran Church in America merged with the middle-of-the-road American 
Lutheran Church and the Assn. of Evangelical Lutheran Churches in 1988 to 
become the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The churches had originated 
along German and Scandinavian divisions. All together, the ELCA is considered 
more moderate than the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod, a theologically and 
politically conservative denomination. 
</P>
<P>
Nickel was born on Oct. 15, 1919, in Vandalia, Ohio. In 1945, he married Betty 
Lou Creamer of Springfield, Ohio, who is now the principal of Jose Sepulveda 
Elementary School in Santa Ana. He attended Wittenburg University in 
Springfield, Ohio, and graduated from the Hamma School of Divinity with a 
master's degree in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to his wife and son, he is survived by daughtersMarilyn Dobbs of 
Indianapolis and Julianne Preston of Hesperia, Calif.; brothers Vernon Nickel 
of Mooresville, N.C., Kenneth Nickel of Jamestown, Ky., and Henry Nickel of 
Portsmith, N.H., and four grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
Services will be at noon Saturday at United Lutheran Church in Santa Ana. 
Graveside services will follow at Fairhaven Memorial Park, 1702 Fairhaven Ave. 
</P>
<P>
The family requests that donations can be made to the American Cancer Society 
in his name.

Residents are calling for the city to take a stand on protection of local 
wetlands after the city ordered a halt to construction work on the new Hoag 
Hospital Child Care Center because of a possible threat to the marshy area. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the city officially recognizes what are commonly known as the Hoag 
wetlands as environmentally sensitive, the area will remain in danger of being 
damaged by the construction, said Jan Vandersloot, a Newport Beach resident and 
board member of the environmental group Amigos de Bolsa Chica. 
</P>
<P>
Vandersloot and Bill Jennings, the president of the West Newport Beach 
Community Assn., approached City Atty. Robert Burnham last Thursday about the 
legality of grading work on the east side of the wetlands. The area of concern 
is about 1,500 square feet of marsh north of Coast Highway and east of Superior 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
The city had approved Hoag's grading plans, but the hospital's permit did not 
show that grading work would infringe upon the wetlands area, city planner 
Patricia Temple said.

New headquarters: Novadyne Computer Systems Co., formerly McDonnell Douglas 
Field Services Co., will build a new headquarters in Santa Ana to house the 300 
people working for the company at three sites in Orange County, spokeswoman Pat 
Dwight said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas Corp. said Sunday that it had sold the computer maintenance 
and distribution division to a management-led investor group for $65 million. 
The company, which has 1,000 employees nationwide, has no plans for changes in 
its employment levels, Dwight said. 
</P>
<P>
Bert Novak, president and chief executive of Novadyne, began negotiating the 
buyout 11 months ago with McDonnell Douglas. Novadyne has more than $100 
million in revenue.

NASA PRESSES SEARCH FOR LEAK THAT HALTED SPACE SHUTTLE FLIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NASA engineers Monday continued to search for the cause of a hydrogen leak that 
has grounded the nation's space-shuttle fleet, conducting further tests of a 
fuel assembly partially manufactured by Parker Bertea Aerospace here. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said the problem 
is located somewhere around the so-called "umbilical-disconnect" system that 
links the external liquid hydrogen fuel tank with the shuttle orbiter's main 
engines. 
</P>
<P>
The disconnect system, which consists of a series of pipes and valves that are 
joined by matching plates, is designed to allow the separation of the fuel tank 
and the orbiter in mid-flight. 
</P>
<P>
A hydrogen fuel leak was first discovered in May on the space shuttle Columbia, 
and NASA decided on Friday to ground all three shuttles when a similar problem 
turned up on the Atlantis. NASA conducted another series of tests Monday on the 
Atlantis, which remains on the launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center in 
Florida, and will discuss the results today. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine-based Parker Bertea builds the 17-inch-diameter main fuel assembly that 
lies at the heart of the umbilical-disconnect system. In a press release 
Monday, NASA said that the leak "appears to be primarily from the 17-inch line 
but possibly with a contribution from the 4-inch line." The large main valves 
on the 17-inch line, one on the orbiter side of the disconnect assembly and one 
on the tank side, are considered prime suspects in the problem. 
</P>
<P>
It could not be determined Monday who makes the 4-inch line, which is used to 
recirculate the hydrogen while the tank is filled. 
</P>
<P>
Other pieces of the disconnect system, including the matching plates, are made 
by a number of different contractors, and the entire assembly is put together 
and tested by shuttle prime contractor Rockwell International Corp. 
</P>
<P>
NASA officials also said the problem could have resulted not from any flaws in 
the disconnect system, but from a slight misalignment of the orbiter and the 
fuel tank. 
</P>
<P>
The 17-inch disconnect assembly consists of 582 different pieces, according to 
Parker Bertea spokesman Richard Charlton, and was modified slightly after the 
Challenger explosion to assure that the fuel connection could never be cut off 
accidentally. 
</P>
<P>
"Every test to date shows the problem is not in the disconnect," Charlton said. 
</P>
<P>
Charlton said the 17-inch assemblies were tested at the Parker Bertea plant 
here using liquid nitrogen at a temperature of about minus 320 degrees 
Fahrenheit. Then they were shipped to Rockwell's Downey facility, one of the 
few locations in the country where tests can be conducted using liquid hydrogen 
at minus 423 degrees, and subjected to the more severe hydrogen tests. 
</P>
<P>
A Rockwell spokesman said the external tank side of the disconnect assembly 
from Colombia was flown back to Downey several weeks ago, and tests so far have 
not revealed any problems. The orbiter side of the Colombia assembly arrived in 
Downey on Saturday, and the two sides will be "mated" on a special stand for a 
series of tests beginning Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Parker Bertea, a subsidiary of Parker Hannifin Corp. of Cleveland, began work 
several months ago on a new design for the disconnect assembly, but Charlton 
said that work was unrelated to any possible flaws in the existing system, 
whose design dates to 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The new fuel assembly, which will feature a 14-inch rather than a 17-inch line, 
will not be completed until mid-1993, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Parker Bertea has annual aerospace revenues of about $700 million, of which 
less than 5% are related to NASA programs, Charlton said.

PENSION PLANS ON LAST LEGS, OBSERVER SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
RETIREMENT: CHANGES IN TAX STATUS HAVE LED TO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF 
PLANS FOLDING. PEOPLE ARE TURNING TO ANNUITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENT VEHICLES.

The private pension system, which for years has been a major source of 
retirement protection as well as investment capital for the economy, is in 
decline as workers and employers turn to other savings vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. private pension system is being torn down," said Howard Weizmann, 
executive director of the Assn. of Private Pension and Welfare Plans. 
</P>
<P>
"The system is dying, and we are watching it die," Weizmann said at a 
conference this month. 
</P>
<P>
While others insist that the decline of the pension system is greatly 
exaggerated, Weizmann said changes in the tax treatment of pension plans and 
increasingly complex regulations have led to an increase in the number of 
pension plans folding and a decline in new plans created. 
</P>
<P>
The gloomy picture for the future of pension plans was further clouded by last 
week's Supreme Court ruling that federal regulators can order corporations in 
bankruptcy protection to restore abandoned pension plans. 
</P>
<P>
Industry officials fear that the decision, against Dallas-based steelmaker LTV 
Corp., will cause more companies to close their pension plans. 
</P>
<P>
"The LTV decision by the Supreme Court tells us that this social service cannot 
be denied based on an individual business's condition," said Willis Goldbeck, 
president of the Washington Business Group on Health, which lobbies for 
businesses on health issues. "Employers have to come to grips with the new 
ideology, that this protection is no longer a benefit but a right." 
</P>
<P>
One way employers appear to be coming to grips with this issue is by shutting 
down their plans or not opening any new ones, Weizmann said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year 15,856 so-called defined-benefit plans were terminated, an increase 
of 37% from 1988, while only 5,461 plans were created, a decline of 67%, 
Weizmann said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have scared people out of this system," he said. "Is this price worth 
paying?" 
</P>
<P>
The defined-benefit plans are particularly significant because they helped fuel 
the stock market boom of the 1980s. But in part because of increased 
regulations, most new plans are defined-contribution plans, under which a 
certain amount of money is set aside for each employee every year. 
</P>
<P>
By law these plans must be much more liquid, and so do not have the investment 
clout of the defined-benefit plans, which guaranteed a certain payment level 
for each retiree. 
</P>
<P>
Weizmann noted that by the end of 1987, private pension plans held $2 trillion 
in assets. This is equal to 32% of the U.S. gross national product. 
</P>
<P>
"A 24% share of the U.S. equity market belongs to pensions, and pensions 
supplied 34.8% of the investment capital provided by all non-banking 
institutions," Weizmann said. 
</P>
<P>
Private pension plans also account for 51% of all new savings in the United 
States, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But we are at the high water mark of the U.S. private pension system," 
Weizmann said. The growing trend toward defined-contribution plans is a way for 
corporations to avoid the regulations involved in traditional pension plans, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals are also turning to annuities and other investment vehicles such as 
individual retirement accounts, instead of pensions.

JAPANESE BUILDERS' CLUB DISBANDS AFTER U.S. BID-RIGGING COMPLAINTS

Executives of Japanese building firms have disbanded a social club to help meet 
U.S. demands for an end to bid rigging in the local construction industry, 
company spokesmen said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-member club had met monthly since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials had voiced suspicions that the meetings, which were closed to 
outsiders, may have included discussions to assign projects to specific 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
The club was disbanded after seven leading members decided to withdraw, the 
Asahi Shimbun national daily reported. 
</P>
<P>
Construction company spokesmen declined to identify the seven. 
</P>
<P>
Bid rigging, or dango in Japanese, has been sharply criticized by Washington as 
an unfair trade practice that keeps foreign companies out of Japan's 
construction market. 
</P>
<P>
But one industry analyst said he doubted that such efforts would be effective. 
</P>
<P>
"Construction firms do not really want to drop the dango system. Top officials 
might say it's bad, but middle managers think it's needed. No firm has yet 
officially prohibited its employees from using dango," he added.

CONVENTIONS: LACKLUSTER, SLAPPED-TOGETHER EXHIBIT BOOTHS ARE LOSING GROUND TO 
SLICK, ATTENTION-GRABBING CREATIONS THAT MAKE COMPANIES STAND OUT.

Exhibitors showcasing their goods and services at jam-packed trade shows have 
learned a difficult lesson about life on the promotional tour, says Robert 
Young, a National City-based maker of custom exhibit booths. 
</P>
<P>
It's tough to stand out in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"Conventions used to be a two- to three-day vacation," said Young, president 
and founder of Motivational Systems Inc., which both designs and constructs 
exhibit booths. "But today, they've become really sophisticated business 
tools." 
</P>
<P>
"There are hordes of people who go to conventions these days," Young says. "As 
a result, it's become one of the most important and least expensive ways of 
generating new business." 
</P>
<P>
But capitalizing at conventions has a prerequisite: Exhibitors must be able to 
draw prospective clients to their booths. 
</P>
<P>
The days of generic, slap-dash booths built with 2-by-4s and plywood panels are 
long gone, Young says. Motivational Systems helps exhibitors attract crowds by 
fabricating booths that present the promoter in the best possible light by 
putting a company's name in neon lights, or designing stand-alone tables to 
showcase a new product, or using space-age decor to emphasize a high-technology 
company on the cutting edge. 
</P>
<P>
By helping exhibitors drum up new business, Motivational Systems is capturing a 
share of the $3 billion that companies spend annually on building and 
transporting exhibits. And, as conventions grow in importance and in numbers, 
Young expects his slice of the pie to get bigger. 
</P>
<P>
According to the International Assn. of Convention and Visitors Bureaus, more 
than 318,643 conventions were held last year nationwide, up 17.5% over 1988. 
Such meetings attracted 74.7 million delegates, up 11.5% over 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Organizations have come to recognize the trade show element of conventions as 
a cost-effective way of generating sales . . . that it's cheaper than sending a 
sales force out on the road making calls," said Al Reese, spokesman for the San 
Diego Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
"The exhibit side of the convention has been one of the fastest-growing 
segments of the industry," Reese said. "That's why you see convention centers 
expanding their exhibit space." 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1974, Motivational Systems' revenues have been growing annually at 
an average 22.5% clip since 1985, and last year the company generated $11 
million in sales. Motivational Systems' list of clients includes local 
companies such as General Dynamics, Rohr Industries, Hahn Co., Fujitsu Systems 
of America and Ocean Garden Products. 
</P>
<P>
The closely held company owns a 50,000-square-foot office, storage and 
production facility in National City and leases a 25,000-square-foot storage 
and service area in Miramar. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Motivational Systems leases two 15,000-square-foot sales and 
production plants, one in Corona and one in Livermore, near San Francisco. Last 
year, Motivational Systems opened a 2,000-square-foot leased sales and limited 
production office in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Motivational Systems' bread-and-butter business, however, is not building 
exhibit booths, Young said. Nearly two-thirds of the company's revenues are 
generated by developing marketing products for residential developers, such as 
decorating and equipping the development project's on-site sales office. The 
company also makes off-site signage and other marketing items that direct 
traffic to new housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, Motivational Systems began developing architectural signage -- 
for example, letters that appear on the building's exterior and help identify 
the structure. The company provided architectural signage for downtown's 
Symphony Towers and the Aventine hotel-office complex in La Jolla. The company 
also makes makes architectural scale models for marketing and planning 
presentations. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Young decided to diversify his company's product line and turned his 
attention to manufacturing custom exhibits and displays. 
</P>
<P>
"We really didn't want the success of our business to depend on the ups and 
downs of the real estate market," Young said. "We were looking to stabilize, 
and we were looking for a way to diversify." 
</P>
<P>
According to Young, Motivational Systems ventured into exhibit booth 
manufacturing because of its production similarities to the company's earlier 
products. 
</P>
<P>
"With the same equipment that we used to set up our residential sales offices, 
we could design and manufacture exhibit booths," Young said. "It was a natural 
extension of what we were already doing. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a common thread in everything that we do -- we're here to identify a 
client's product or name," Young said. "Whether it's a sign on a building or an 
exhibit for a client at a trade show -- we identify them. The only difference 
is the stage that we work on." 
</P>
<P>
Motivational Systems' 200 employees include designers, cabinet makers, 
technicians, graphic artists, printers, installers, shipping personnel, 
painters and electricians who assemble the modern-day exhibit booth. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Steen, who heads Motivational Systems exhibit division, said a typical 
exhibit booth consists of panels, cabinets, shelves and columns. The plywood 
"shell" is coated with paint and "high-pressure plastic laminates that can 
create just about any look you want: marble finishes, granite, stripes and 
patterns." Often, acoustic fabrics, plexiglass and metal components are added 
as finishing touches. 
</P>
<P>
"These days, if you go to a convention with an outdated booth, it's like going 
into a meeting with a 6-inch tie," Steen said. 
</P>
<P>
Motivational Systems manufactures a range of exhibit items, from small 
table-top displays that cost about $1,000 to stage-like productions, which cost 
more than $200,000. Typically, Motivational Systems charges $100 per square 
foot of exhibit space. A typical exhibit booth costs $20,000 to $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
Witnessing how competitive the trade show environment has become, Ocean Garden 
Products, a San Diego-based importer of Mexican seafood products, turned to 
Motivational Systems to build an exhibit booth that would turn heads. 
</P>
<P>
Motivational Systems created a back-lighted sign that made Ocean Garden's logo 
visible from every corner of the convention hall. The 20-foot by 20-foot booth 
also featured a kitchen, where chefs prepared seafood dishes, a private 
conference room and display cases. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a leader in the marketplace, and people have come to expect a certain 
level of excellence from us," said Holly Adrian, a company spokeswoman. "It's 
important for us to have as much of a presence (at trade shows) as possible. 
</P>
<P>
"The display cases were lit from the bottom," Adrian said. "We had our seafood 
products on ice with a glow from underneath. . . . It was really attractive." 
</P>
<P>
Young says he owes much of his success to the Minnesota school system's strong 
industrial arts program, which allowed him to learn woodworking and welding 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God for the Minnesota school system," Young said. Although successful 
today, Young is the first to admit that as a young man his career had little 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, Young left Southwest Missouri State University after studying business 
administration for two years and started a string of odd sales jobs, including 
hawking baby pictures at shopping malls. "You know, those photos you get of 
your kid for Aunt Nellie and grandma," he said. Young followed that stint by 
building car washes in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1972, Young got an opportunity to work for an Orange County company 
that sold signs to subdivision developers. When the company closed its San 
Diego office in 1974, Young decided to go into business for himself and offered 
his services to the abandoned clients. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first six months, I was out getting clients during the day, then I 
would come back around 4 and work until midnight building the signs," Young 
said.

SAN DIEGO-BASED VIDEOCIPHER IS PART OF LEVERAGED BUYOUT DEAL; 
</P>
<P>
ACQUISITION: FORSTMANN LITTLE'S $1.6-BILLION BUYOUT OF GENERAL INSTRUMENT WILL 
INCLUDE THE ELECTRONICS FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Leveraged buyout specialist Forstmann Little &amp; Co. has agreed to acquire 
General Instrument, a cable television equipment manufacturer that owns San 
Diego-based VideoCipher, in a deal valued at $1.6 billion, the two companies 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The deal is not the largest leveraged buyout announced so far this year -- that 
honor belongs to the proposed $4.4-billion employee buyout of UAL Corp., parent 
of United Airlines. But it comes at a time when merger activity in general and 
leveraged buyouts in particular have slowed, largely because of the decline in 
prices of the high-risk junk bonds that financed many offers. 
</P>
<P>
New York-based Forstmann Little, however, is using its own funds and bank loans 
rather than junk bonds to finance this deal. In a leveraged buyout, investors 
typically borrow money to buy a company and then pay off the debt with cash 
generated by the business or by selling pieces of the company. 
</P>
<P>
General Instrument's VideoCipher subsidiary makes satellite/cable TV encoders 
and decoders that are designed to keep owners of satellite dishes from 
receiving programming without paying for it. VideoCipher's technology now 
dominates the satellite TV industry, and dish owners must buy VideoCipher 
"descramblers" in order to clearly receive signals from more than 60 
programmers, including HBO, Turner Broadcasting, Showtime, ESPN and others. 
</P>
<P>
VideoCipher accounted for about $250 million of General Instrument's $3.7 
billion revenue during the fiscal year ended Feb. 28, sources said. Of 
VideoCipher's 2,000 employees, about 450 work at the unit's San Diego 
facilities in Sorrento Mesa. General Instrument, which also makes cable 
television electronics and coaxial cable systems, has a payroll of 15,000. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting of employees Monday afternoon, VideoCipher General Manager J. 
Lawrence Dunham said that the tender offer will not affect jobs or operations. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to General Instrument's cable/satellite TV technology, Forstmann 
Little may have been attracted by VideoCipher's all-digital high definition TV 
(HDTV) technology, one of seven under consideration by a Federal Communications 
Commission review committee for possible standardization. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said Forstmann Little is paying a fairly modest price for New 
York-based General Instrument, which has enjoyed good earnings and revenue 
growth in recent years. And yet the price represents a premium over General 
Instrument's erratic stock price, which closed Friday at $36.25 a share on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably not a bad deal all around," said Jay D. Samstag, an analyst with 
the Duff &amp; Phelps investment firm in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
General Instrument's stock closed Monday at $45.125, slightly above the price 
offered by Forstmann Little. But analysts doubted a better offer would 
materialize. 
</P>
<P>
Forstmann Little has agreed to pay $44.50 a share in cash for each of General 
Instrument's approximately 32 million shares, including common shares 
outstanding and debt convertible into common stock, for a total of about $1.4 
billion. The rest of the transaction's value is existing debt that Forstmann 
Little will assume or refinance. 
</P>
<P>
Forstmann Little said it will launch a tender offer for a majority of the stock 
within five days. The transaction is fully financed through a combination of 
Forstmann Little's existing equity funds and bank financing provided by 
Manufacturers Hanover Bank in New York and Continental Bank in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
General Instrument's management is not yet participating in the transaction but 
might later, Forstmann Little spokesman John Scanlon said. Current management 
is expected to remain with the company, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the merger agreement, Forstmann Little will be paid $33 million if 
General Instrument accepts a higher merger offer. 
</P>
<P>
Since the decline in the junk bond market, leveraged buyouts have slumped. Only 
11 deals were announced in the first five months of the year, contrasted with 
33 from January to May of 1989, according to W.T. Grimm &amp; Co., a 
Schaumburg, Ill.-based consulting firm owned by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. 
However, the dollar volume increased slightly to $6.2 billion over the $5.5 
billion in the same period last year, the company reported. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that this all-cash offer provides an excellent value for our 
shareholders," said Frank G. Hickey, chairman and chief executive of General 
Instrument. "We look forward to the new opportunities that the association with 
Forstmann Little will provide for General Instrument." 
</P>
<P>
"Because of Forstmann Little's ability to employ a uniquely conservative 
capital structure, all of the companies it has previously acquired have been 
able to continue to invest in their future," said Theodore J. Forstmann, a 
general partner of Forstmann Little and an outspoken critic of junk bond 
financing. "Accordingly, we expect that, after the acquisition, General 
Instrument Corp. will continue its position as a market leader and will be able 
to maintain its technological superiority." 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Harry Rosenthal with Deutsche Bank Group in New York said Forstmann 
Little is betting on growth areas for General Instrument, including satellite 
projects in Japan and Great Britain, and cable ventures in Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"They're really paying for General Instrument's domestic business . . . and 
they're getting the new ventures for free," he said.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: VENTURA COUNTY HOUSE SALES UP 23% FOR QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sales of new single-family houses in Ventura County in the second quarter rose 
23% from the first quarter but remained 48% below the sales pace of a year 
earlier, a real estate research firm said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In the quarter that ended June 30, 383 new detached houses were sold, up from 
312 in the January-March period of this year but down from 733 units sold in 
the second quarter of 1989, The Meyers Group reported. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the median price for a new single-family house in Ventura County was 
$337,500 in the latest quarter, down 5% from $354,990 in the first quarter but 
up 2% from $329,950 a year earlier, Meyers said. The median price means half 
the houses sold for more than that price, and half sold for less.

COMPANIES CONSIDERING TAKEOVERS NOW LOOK TO THE GLOBAL MARKET; 
</P>
<P>
INVESTMENT: THE JUNK BOND FUELED FRENZY OF THE '80S IS OVER. COMPANIES ARE 
PUTTING UP MORE EQUITY AND NOT LOOKING JUST FOR QUICK PROFITS.

They say the takeover boom is over, but if that's so, how do you explain Philip 
Morris Cos.' decision to buy Swiss candy maker Jacobs Suchard for $3.8 billion 
or ConAgra Inc.'s $1.34-billion purchase of Beatrice Co. 
</P>
<P>
Easy: The mergers and acquisitions business hasn't died, it has evolved into 
another stage. Deal makers are doing a new kind of buyout, one that harks back 
to the days before the junk bond binge but has a few novel twists. 
</P>
<P>
If you ask investment bankers about the deals they're doing these days, two 
words keep surfacing: strategic and global. 
</P>
<P>
Philip Keevil, a managing director at S.G. Warburg &amp; Co., the U.S. arm of 
the British investment firm, said it has been swamped in recent months, 
handling "mostly transactions that are started by strategic acquirers." 
</P>
<P>
In a strategic deal, a company seeks to expand through acquisition of a firm in 
a similar or related industry. This is a far cry from the buyouts that 
dominated the merger wave of the 1980s because they are undertaken by companies 
interested in running a business, not investors looking for quick profits. 
</P>
<P>
Strategic transactions also differ from the mega-deals of the '80s because they 
do not involve the sale of the risky junk bonds that helped finance -- and in 
some cases, undermine -- big buyouts. The acquiring companies are putting up 
much more equity to finance their transactions. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the biggest deals of 1990 have been strategic. When food giant ConAgra 
bought Beatrice, it picked up well-known labels including Swift's meats, 
Butterball turkeys and Wesson oil. Philip Morris, another food company, found a 
candy maker in Jacobs Suchard that would broaden its base. 
</P>
<P>
Even some recent hostile bids were strategic, including Georgia Pacific Corp.'s 
$5-billion purchase of rival paper producer Great Northern Nekoosa Corp., and 
Torchmark Inc.'s failed $6.34-billion offer for another insurance and financial 
services company, American General Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The emphasis on strategic moves is similar to the late 1970s and early 1980s, 
before junk bonds came into vogue. Most of the deals done in the old days were 
by firms looking for opportunities to expand. 
</P>
<P>
Now they want to expand not only in their own countries, but overseas. Today's 
market is global, and more acquisitions are what deal makers call cross-border 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
Among Warburg's recent deals was Reckitt and Colman PLC's purchase of the 
Boyle-Midway division of American Home Products Corp. for $1.25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Reckitt and Colman, a British firm, had already bought U.S. businesses, 
including Durkee foods and Airwick air fresheners. The purchase of 
Boyle-Midway, a consumer products business, represented a further move into the 
U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
Now, "every business looks at their competitive position on a worldwide basis," 
said a prominent U.S. investment banker who asked not to be identified. "You 
can't be in the car industry without looking at the worldwide car industry." 
</P>
<P>
If this sounds like the mergers business has found renewed vigor, it hasn't. 
There is still plenty of evidence that in spite of so many strategic and global 
opportunities, the business has shrunk. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. merger transactions fell 50% over the first half of 1990 from a year 
earlier, the financial research firm Securities Data Corp. said. There's proof 
beyond the numbers. In June, Bankers Trust New York Corp. said it was reducing 
the corporate finance staff by 10%, the latest financial services company to 
cut personnel because of the drop-off in mergers. 
</P>
<P>
Several days later, one of the most prominent takeover strategists of the 
1980s, the investor group Coniston Partners, said it was disbanding because of 
scarcity of financing and worthwhile targets. Coniston's three founding 
partners said they had to be realistic about the changing market. 
</P>
<P>
The change has forced investors and deal makers to adapt, and investment 
bankers who have sought cross-border deals are flourishing. 
</P>
<P>
Coniston's founders said they would still seek acquisitions, but via new forms 
of financing. They said they're also branching out into areas they hadn't 
focused on, such as real estate.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: TRANSTECHNOLOGY LOSES $4.63 MILLION IN QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TransTechnology Corp., a defense and industrial products concern based in 
Sherman Oaks, posted a $4.63-million fiscal fourth-quarter loss and suspended 
its quarterly dividend. 
</P>
<P>
The loss in the quarter ended March 31, which TransTechnology had predicted, 
contrasted with a $5.26-million profit a year earlier and came on a 13% drop in 
revenue to $62.4 million from $71.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
TransTechnology said the latest loss included a $3-million loss from operations 
and $10 million to $12 million in writedowns, mainly to lower the value of its 
inventory. 
</P>
<P>
For the full year, TransTechnology lost $8.44 million on revenue of $198.5 
million. The previous year, it earned $9.24 million on revenue of $219 million. 
</P>
<P>
TransTechnology said it suspended its common-share dividend as part of a 
revised credit arrangement with its bank lenders. The company last paid a 
dividend of 24 cents a share in June.

RANDY LEWIS: KEY EPISODE IN ROD SERLING SERIES IS REALLY GOOD TV SHOW; 
</P>
<P>
FANTASY: 'IT'S A GOOD LIFE' IS ONE MORSEL OF THE ARTIST'S GENIUS THAT MOST 
PEOPLE REMEMBER VIVIDLY, EVEN IF IT'S BEEN DECADES SINCE THEY'VE SEEN IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Twilight Zone" wasn't any mere TV series. It was Rod Serling's bizarre, 
poetic, horrific, magical, sublime little amusement park where the price of 
admission was affordable by anyone with just a farthing of imagination. 
</P>
<P>
I would place the show high on a list of my all-time favorite series because, 
although Serling and his cadre of writers often took viewers to distant reaches 
of the solar system, "The Twilight Zone" really was always just around the 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
And it still is -- as the programmers at KTLA Channel 5 have learned so well 
over the past several years from the popularity of their semiannual "Twilight 
Zone" marathons, like the one that will fill up most of the channel's Fourth of 
July schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Archival surprises are no longer likely to pop up. That material was pretty 
much exhausted a few years ago when a batch of little-seen, one-hour episodes 
from the 1963 season were dusted off and shown anew. 
</P>
<P>
The only morsels left are three or four episodes that never were included in 
the syndication package for reasons, ranging from an old plagiarism lawsuit to 
the allegedly unsympathetic portrayal of a Japanese character, that still are 
cited today. 
</P>
<P>
What is left -- for those of us who have seen most of the episodes several 
times, or for those who have never seen them -- is the richness of the writing, 
the wealth of ideas and the range of topics and emotions this remarkable show 
covered. 
</P>
<P>
I sometimes think that the problem with "The New Twilight Zone" and other 
latter-day attempts to clone the original was that the signature mixture of 
reality, fantasy and science fiction was handled so well the first-time around. 
What's left? (Serling had the same complaint about some later "Twilight Zone" 
episodes and with most of the subsequent "Night Gallery" series that he hosted, 
but in which he played a far less active role creatively.) 
</P>
<P>
There's a prime example in Wednesday's Marathon lineup, an episode that 
illustrates how the show could both be so fantastically (in the literal sense) 
elsewhere, and so unnervingly close by. The segment -- "It's a Good Life," to 
air at 7 p.m. -- is one that most people remember vividly, even if it's been 
decades since they've seen it. 
</P>
<P>
It opens with Serling describing a rural Midwestern town that apparently has 
disappeared from the U.S. map, and winds up off in its own little universe 
somewhere. Serling introduces us to each of the farm community's 
wholesome-looking residents, while alluding to a monster that keeps them all in 
a constant state of terror. 
</P>
<P>
Serling ends the suspense early by introducing us to this unholy horror: The 
camera cuts quickly and we see a guileless-looking, freckle-faced boy named 
Anthony (played by Billy Mumy, later of "Lost in Space" fame). He is swinging 
nonchalantly on a fence near the barn as Serling's voice-over continues; 
suddenly, he seems to be aware of the audience looking in at him. His cherubic 
expression disappears, his eyes widen and he glares menacingly into the camera. 
</P>
<P>
What transpires in the next 30 minutes is an object lesson in taut writing, a 
palpably believable scenario, and powerful but unobtrusive acting that is as 
pertinent in 1990 as it was in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
The premise is that this cute, all-American-looking lad, through some 
unexplained quirk, has been born with the ability to mentally translate his 
wishes into reality. Anything or anyone who angers him, or even thinks bad 
thoughts about him, is "wished away into the cornfield" never to be seen again. 
It's a fantasy most everyone has entertained at one time or another. 
</P>
<P>
We are told that Anthony doesn't like singing, so no one dares even hum a tune 
lest he or she be wished away -- or wished into some grotesque subhuman form. 
Anthony, in fact, has wished away all contact with the outside world, except 
for his own crude form of television, conjured up infrequently as a gesture of 
his generosity. 
</P>
<P>
As a birthday present, a neighbor gets one of the rare record albums still in 
existence. But he can't listen to it because the adults fear that a syllable of 
a vocal might slip out and upset little Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
Animals get no better treatment from this boy who embodies innocence gone awry: 
A dog is heard, off camera, barking at Anthony, whose eyes swell up -- the dog 
is heard to whine, then is silent. Anthony gets bored with a gopher -- and 
wishes three heads on it, before commanding: "Be dead. You be dead!" 
</P>
<P>
All the while, to maintain a pretense of cheeriness that vanished long ago, the 
boy's parents and neighbors constantly reassure him -- and themselves -- that 
no matter what horrors Anthony wreaks upon them, "it's a good thing you did -- 
it's a real good thing." 
</P>
<P>
The premise was a brilliant, provocative one: What if a child really did have 
the power to control the world? A frightening prospect to anyone who has 
witnessed the tantrums of a mind untempered by mature thought processes. 
</P>
<P>
The flip side of the idea wasn't quite so obvious -- a subtle testimony that 
"absolute power corrupts absolutely," that monstrous power invested in any 
individual's hands, even the most angelic, is not to be courted. 
</P>
<P>
The story also could be seen as a critique of any zealot who would remake the 
world in his or her own image. No matter what we think is the "right" way to 
live, institutionalizing it is to wish all conflicting choices into the 
cornfield of intolerance. "It's a Good Life" carries the not-so-veiled message 
that anyone wanting to do so is no more than a bratty little tyke at heart. 
</P>
<P>
We needn't look hard to find examples of people doing their best to wish away 
those factions in society that irritate them -- just look at Sen. Jesse Helms 
and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher and all that "offensive" art and artists, or Florida 
anti-obscenity crusader Jack Thompson and rap group 2 Live Crew. Right here in 
Orange County, city officials glower at theater groups that take a public stand 
on a controversial issue, and at rock music clubs that merely try to exist. 
</P>
<P>
KTLA has, probably unconsciously, made the episode all the more appropriate by 
airing it on Independence Day. It's a good message -- a real good message. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Twilight Zone Marathon" runs Wednesday from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. on KTLA

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Samuel K. Doe has agreed in principle to resign as rebels attacking 
the capital of Monrovia battle troops in the city's eastern and western 
suburbs, political sources said today. 
</P>
<P>
Doe was told to resign today by a delegation of close aides and politicians, 
the sources added. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberian president said he will step down on condition his safety and that 
of his minority Krahn tribe are guaranteed, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.S. officials said they believed that Doe's government could collapse 
in a matter of days. 
</P>
<P>
The officials, asking not to be identified, said in Washington that there had 
been a number of desertions from the elite unit that protects Doe and that his 
hold on power was becoming more precarious by the day. 
</P>
<P>
Two officials said Doe's ouster could come before the weekend. He has ruled 
Liberia for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said there was fighting on both 
sides of the St. Paul River in addition to the combat northeast of Monrovia. 
The fighting was inhibiting communications out of Liberia. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a rebel source reached by telephone from neighboring Ivory Coast 
said that about 800 rebels of Liberia's National Patriotic Front have begun an 
attack on Monrovia and that several thousand more are approaching to "put an 
end" to Doe and his government. 
</P>
<P>
The source, based near the Liberian border, said rebel leader Charles Taylor 
was at the front directing attacks on the Liberian capital. Taylor launched his 
rebellion last Christmas Eve, reportedly with help from Libyan leader Moammar 
Kadafi. It is not known whether Kadafi has provided any assistance recently. 
</P>
<P>
At the Pentagon, spokesman Pete Williams said a Navy task force is standing 
"over the horizon" off Liberia ready to evacuate the estimated 795 Americans in 
Liberia if requested to do so by the State Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We're considering all options, but a decision to evacuate has not yet been 
made," said Boucher at the State Department. There were no reports of injury to 
any Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Officials have said the U.S. government is prepared to evacuate Doe if it is 
asked to do so. They said Togo, also in West Africa, has agreed to receive Doe 
if he is forced out of Liberia. 
</P>
<P>
Boucher said Monrovia is without water, electricity or telephone service. All 
main roads out of the capital are cut. Most of Doe's Cabinet and other senior 
administration officials have fled. Liberian and diplomatic sources said Army 
Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Henry Dubar resigned during the weekend. A dusk-to-dawn 
curfew was in effect. 
</P>
<P>
Doe has offered a national unity government with participation by Taylor's 
group, but the rebel leader has rejected the proposal. Taylor has repeatedly 
demanded that Doe resign before he and the rebels will stop their advance. 
</P>
<P>
There also have been official U.S. contacts with Taylor, a former Liberian 
government official who infiltrated the country six months ago with a small 
band of followers. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor has informed the U.S. envoys that if his movement ousts Doe, he will 
promote democracy and respect human rights.

SIX QUITTING THE POLITBURO;

A third of the Soviet Communist Party Politburo, including Foreign Minister 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, will not seek reelection, President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev said today at the current party Congress, demonstrating the 
diminishing importance of the once-supreme ruling body. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze announced he would be one of the six members not seeking 
reelection, saying he no longer believes Politburo membership is necessary for 
a minister also serving on the Presidential Council and other government 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
Another of Gorbachev's closest advisers, Alexander N. Yakovlev, also said he 
would not try to retain his Politburo post. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev announced that another two full members of the Politburo -- Nikolai 
N. Slyunkov and Vitaly I. Vorotnikov -- will not seek reelection to the 
12-member body, which includes seven non-voting members. 
</P>
<P>
Non-voting Politburo members Lev N. Zaikov and Alexandra P. Biryukova also 
announced they will step down. 
</P>
<P>
And a member of the second-most powerful body in the Communist Party, Gumer I. 
Usmanov, said he will no longer sit on the party secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said that Slyunkov, 61, was very ill and in the hospital. He has not 
attended the party session, which opened Monday in the Kremlin Palace of 
Congresses. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said that Usmanov, 58, also is resigning for health reasons. 
</P>
<P>
He did not give reasons for the resignations submitted by Vorotnikov, 64, and 
Biryukova, 61, although Vorotnikov recently lost a job that carried nearly 
automatic inclusion on the Politburo, that of president of the Russian 
Federation, the largest Soviet republic. 
</P>
<P>
When Gorbachev announced Biryukova's name, there was a pause, and a 
considerable hum of surprise among the delegates. Biryukova, the only woman on 
the Politburo, was in charge of consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
The shortage of consumer goods has been one of the main complaints about 
Gorbachev's policies. 
</P>
<P>
The resignations have not been accepted yet, said Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Word of Biryukova's resignation came the day after Gorbachev told the congress 
he would like to see more women elected to senior party positions. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev made the announcement reluctantly, after he was pressed several times 
by delegates, who asked from the floor whether rumors of impending Politburo 
resignations were correct. 
</P>
<P>
The resignations came on a day that conservatives mounted a counteroffensive 
against some of Gorbachev's reforms. 
</P>
<P>
Hard-line Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev won thunderous applause from the 
4,567 delegates at the 28th Party Congress when he angrily denounced what he 
described as a media campaign against conservative party members and their 
allies in the military. 
</P>
<P>
"In our day, there are forces going against socialism and the Communist Party . 
. . and they have great influence in the mass media," Ligachev said. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, who is general secretary of the party, sat stone-faced as Ligachev 
and other conservatives criticized reforms that they said are weakening the 
authority of the party.

A 150-pound gray-rumped hog and a German shepherd named Calamity Jane will be 
taken care of for the rest of their lives after inheriting part of a 
$600,000-plus estate left by Margo Lamp of Davenport, who died in February at 
81. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's strange at all," said Susan Halberstadt of the American 
Humane Assn. in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very special bond that exists between people and their animals." 
</P>
<P>
Lamp willed the bulk of her estate to the Scott County Humane Society but set 
aside money for her pet dog and her hog, Mr. Pig. She had no close relatives 
and left $1,000 to a distant cousin and $1,000 to a friend, said her lawyer, 
George Goebel, who doesn't think her will will be contested.

Former Prime Minister Menachem Begin was hospitalized in good condition today 
after breaking his right hip in a fall at his home, a hospital spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman, Dvorah Weissman, said Begin was undergoing surgery and added, 
"He was fully conscious when he came in and was aware of his injury." 
</P>
<P>
It was the second time the 76-year-old Begin was taken to Shaarei Tzedek 
Hospital in Jerusalem this year. He was admitted with pneumonia on May 16 and 
released two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
Begin stepped down as prime minister in September, 1983, without giving a 
public explanation. He was believed to be depressed about Israel's military 
involvement in Lebanon and by his wife Aliza's death. 
</P>
<P>
Since resigning, Begin has not taken part in public affairs.

It was apparently just a typical case of trying to make the boss look good when 
expert golfer Dan Quayle spread the word that President Bush had beat him on 
the links. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just being pleasant, I'll bet," Bush said of his vice president today. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle somewhat sheepishly told reporters. "He won on the first tee." 
</P>
<P>
"Won one hole. That's what he meant," Bush clarified. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle had told reporters on Monday when setting out to golf near Bush's 
seaside vacation home that he was "destined to lose." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle is renowned in Washington for his expertise on the golf course. Bush on 
the other hand, is trying to improve his somewhat ragged game. 
</P>
<P>
When asked later Monday who won the game at the Cape Arundel Golf Course, 
Quayle said, "The President won." Suspicion was widespread that he was speaking 
tongue in cheek.

The two Germanys have agreed to hold joint elections Dec. 2, clearing the way 
for unification before the end of the year, a West German government source 
said today.

The source, close to Chancellor Helmut Kohl, said the West German leader had 
accepted the date agreed to Monday night by East Germany's coalition leaders 
for the first free all-German elections since 1932.

The National Assembly voted overwhelmingly today to replace the Marxist state 
emblem with Hungary's traditional coat of arms. Lawmakers then burst into a 
spontaneous singing of the national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
It was the nation's latest move to erase the legacy of four decades of 
Communist rule.

DOW TRADING SLOWS FOR HOLIDAY, UP 8.17;

CLOSES ABOVE 2,900 AGAIN ON MIDYEAR SHIFTING

<P>
Stock prices moved higher at the outset and managed some modest gains today in 
sluggish trading in advance of the July Fourth holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The market's best known indicator finished above 2,900 again for the first time 
in eight sessions. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 8.17 points at 2,906.44. Volume was 
130,050,000 shares. 
</P>
<P>
Trading was relatively light as the U.S. financial markets are going to be 
closed Wednesday in observance of Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the rise in stocks to seasonal readjustments of investment 
portfolios along with the start of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Institutional investors such as pension funds, they said, were looking for good 
values among blue-chip stocks as part of mid-year reallocations of funds. 
</P>
<P>
In economic news, the Commerce Department said orders to factories for 
manufactured goods rose 2.1% in May, offsetting a revised 2.1% decline the 
previous month. 
</P>
<P>
But market watchers said the report had minimal impact on the stock market as 
the increase had been widely expected. 
</P>
<P>
They said traders are more interested in the employment figures for June which 
are to be released on Friday. The monthly reports on employment give the 
markets their first official glimpse of economic activity in the preceding 
month and often contain information that affects stock and bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
Prices pulled back in the credit market this morning as bond traders marked 
time ahead of the Independence Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation about an announcement of a new bond sale to raise money for the 
federal savings and loan bailout restrained trading activity in the early 
going. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury also was scheduled to release details of its regular weekly bill 
auction and of a seven-year note auction next week. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was off 5/32 point, or about 
$1.60 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which rises when price declines, edged 
up to 8.41% from 8.40% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Napolitano, a market strategist at R. C. Government Securities Inc., said 
the pre-holiday atmosphere made for an uneventful session. 
</P>
<P>
"It is dull -- very," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Financial markets and many businesses will be closed Wednesday in observance of 
July Fourth. Trading was expected to wind down to a trickle later in the day as 
market participants leave early for the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Napolitano also said traders were reluctant to stake out new positions before 
the government auction announcements. Concerns that abundant supplies coming to 
market will depress prices have been on traders' minds for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
In late morning, the Resolution Funding Corp., the agency handling the thrift 
bailout, announced plans to sell $5 billion in 30-year bonds on July 10. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Treasury said it will sell $18 billion of three- and six-month 
bills Monday and $8 billion of seven-year notes July 11. 
</P>
<P>
Traders ignored a Commerce Department report showing orders to factories for 
manufactured goods rebounded 2.1% in May. The figure was considered old news 
because it reflected economic activity two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the June unemployment report, due Friday, is widely awaited 
because it will furnish the first glimpse of how the economy performed last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were down 1/32 point to 1/8 point, intermediate maturities were 1/16 point to 
3/32 point lower and long-term issues posted losses of 5/32 point to 3/16 
point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Brothers daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, fell 0.89 to 1,161.68. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills sold Monday fell to 7.95% as the discount 
slipped 2 basis points to 7.70%. Yields on the new six-month bills declined to 
7.98% as the discount dipped 1 basis point to 7.58%. Yields on one-year bills 
were unchanged at 8.03% as the discount remained at 7.48%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8 1/4%, down slightly from 8 3/8% late Monday.

Southland Corp., owner of the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, has revealed 
details of a proposed restructuring it hopes will enable the company to avoid 
bankruptcy court. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company 
proposed swapping one share of common stock for 10 shares of new stock issued 
to current bondholders through the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that would be a key point to the bondholders, who would like to see 
some liquidity in the shares they receive," Southland spokeswoman Cecilia 
Norwood said. 
</P>
<P>
Southland has been staggering under debt accumulated in a $4.9-billion 
leveraged buyout and increased competition in the convenience store business. 
</P>
<P>
The company already has missed $69 million in interest payments and could be 
forced into bankruptcy on July 15.

News of the illegal strike sent crude oil prices higher in New York.

About 1,000 workers refused to pump oil and gas and blockaded helicopter 
landing pads at offshore platforms to stop non-strikers from landing.

"We have illegal strikes at all our platforms, all the helicopter decks are 
closed," said Morten Woldsdal, spokesman for state oil firm Statoil.

NORTHWEST AIRLINES COULD BUY EASTERN

Northwest Airlines is considering the purchase of troubled Eastern Airlines and 
is slated to meet with Eastern's unions to determine if the carrier's labor 
problems can be solved, it was reported today. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post, citing sources, reported that representatives of the 
International Assn. of Machinists met Monday to discuss the problems of 
integrating Eastern employees into Northwest as a prelude to talks later this 
week between Northwest Chairman Alfred A. Checchi and John Peterpaul, vice 
president of the IAM. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Northwest spokesman Doug Miller as saying the 
Minnesota-based airline is examining all its options for growth and expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not in a position to discuss the options we are reviewing, nor should 
anyone conclude that such an examination will lead to a transaction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Northwest approached Eastern trustee Martin Shugrue about 
buying some of the Miami-based carrier's airport gates in Atlanta and some of 
its maintenance facilities but was rebuffed. 
</P>
<P>
Shugrue, who was appointed by the bankruptcy court last April to replace Frank 
Lorenzo and his management team, "made it very clear that parts of the airline 
are not for sale. It is the whole airline," the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Creditors apparently feel that Eastern cannot survive on its own and that a 
sale is the only way they can recoup their money. "I think the creditors' group 
hopes it can be sold," a source told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March, 1989, just days 
after the IAM struck in a bitter contract dispute and was joined on the picket 
line by pilots and flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
The airline was almost shut down but managed, with the help of attendants and 
pilots who crossed the picket line and newly trained pilots, to return to the 
air on an abbreviated schedule. The carrier is still believed to be losing $1 
million per day, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Shugrue took over with a promise to seek labor peace, but talks with the Air 
Line Pilots Assn. broke down last week when the union rejected his offer to 
recall 650 pilots and restore their seniority over three years. Hard-line 
pilots want a more complete restoration of their seniority over strikebreakers.

Melville Corp. today announced an agreement to buy the assets of Circus World 
Toy Stores Inc. for about $95 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
The purchase of the 330 Circus World stores from Greenman Bros. Inc. will 
expand Melville's position in toy retailing. 
</P>
<P>
Circus World will become a part of Melville's Kay-Bee division, which operates 
770 toy stores in 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition will be financed from operating cash flow and is not expected 
to dilute earnings, Melville said. 
</P>
<P>
From its headquarters in Rye, N.Y., Melville oversees a collection of specialty 
retailers, including the off-price apparel chain Marshalls, Thom McAn shoe 
shops, Linens 'n Things and This End Up furniture stores. 
</P>
<P>
It also owns the CVS drug and beauty aids chain and last week announced plans 
to buy Peoples Drug Stores Inc. for $330 million.

Katharine Hepburn is auctioning off one of her paintings to benefit a wildlife 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
It is the only painting she has ever offered for public sale or view, said the 
Oscar-winning actress, who has been painting since the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-by-20-inch work is an impressionistic look at the Beverly Hills valley, 
somewhat hidden by tall trees and framed by a white rail fence. 
</P>
<P>
"I do hope it will bring a price, although I wouldn't give you a nickel for 
it," joked the lifelong summer resident of this shoreline community. 
</P>
<P>
Hepburn painted the work while staying at actor John Barrymore's California 
home. She guessed she completed it in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
The painting will be among works of art to be auctioned this fall to benefit 
the North American Wildlife Assn. Inc., which is seeking to buy the house that 
serves as its headquarters.

Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber is ending his six-year marriage to singer Sarah 
Brightman. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Webber, the 42-year-old composer of such hits as "Phantom of the Opera" 
and "Cats," issued a statement Monday saying he had become "close friends" with 
another woman, Madeleine Gurdon. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear to me that, with the greatest sadness, I have to face the fact 
that my marriage to Sarah Brightman is at an end," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The statement did not say whether the couple would divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Webber met Brightman nine years ago and cast her in "Cats." They had no 
children. He has two children by a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply saddened that our marriage should end like this," said Brightman, 
30. "It is not something I . . . wish for or have sought." 
</P>
<P>
Gurdon, a 27-year-old businesswoman, would not comment on the announcement.

FRESH 'FM' SCORES BIG AMID RERUNS 
</P>

Television viewers tuning into prime-time network shows are going for the 
laughs and a bit of deja vu, with most of the top-rated shows being reruns of 
situation comedies, but an original episode of "FM" caused its own kind of 
static, it was reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's "Cheers" (NBC) was the No. 1 show last week in the Nielsen ratings, 
followed by "A Different World." "Roseanne" (ABC), the perennial contender with 
"Cheers" for the top spot, got bumped into a tie for third place with CBS's 
"Designing Women," up from 10th place. 
</P>
<P>
Situation comedies commanded nearly all the top spots, but seventh place was a 
three-way tie shared by CBS's "60 Minutes" and NBC's "Cosby Show" and "Golden 
Girls." 
</P>
<P>
The only other "serious" show was "Unsolved Mysteries" (NBC) in 10th place. 
</P>
<P>
In a real surprise, an original episode of the NBC sitcom "FM," which aired 
Thursday night at 9:30, finished in fifth place. In another bit of deja vu, the 
show, which has boomeranged all over NBC's schedule, also finished in fifth 
place on another Thursday night at 9:30 -- Aug. 17, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's full-court press of "Quantum Leap" -- an unprecedented scheduling move of 
showing episodes for five successive nights -- seemed to grab viewers' 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
More than 60 million people tuned in and the show won its 10-11 p.m. cumulative 
time period with every episode averaging a 20 share or better. The series had 
its highest ranking ever on Thursday night, finishing in 12th place and 
Tuesday's installment was ranked 19th. 
</P>
<P>
Fox's animated-alienated sitcom, "The Simpsons," moved to 11th place, down from 
a three-way tie for 10th last week. 
</P>
<P>
The network's Sunday broadcast of "Married . . . With Children" dropped to a 
tie for 14th place, compared with its tie for seventh place the week before. A 
Saturday night airing of "Married" finished in 81st place. So much for who's 
watching TV on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Another Fox show, "In Living Color," dropped to a three-way tie for 28th place, 
compared with a 14th place spot the week before. 
</P>
<P>
The runaway hit of the mid-season replacements, ABC's "America's Funniest Home 
Videos," posted a gain to 17th place, up from 21st place the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
In the Sunday night movie race, NBC's rebroadcast of "Perry Mason: The Case of 
the Avenging Ace," won a verdict in 14th place; ABC's "The Dead Zone" was 
comatose in 42nd place, and CBS's "Desperate for Love" remained unrequited in 
49th place. 
</P>
<P>
In the night-by-night race, NBC tied with CBS on Monday, and held the lead for 
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday. CBS held court on Sunday and ABC had 
Friday night all to itself. 
</P>
<P>
NBC won the week ending July 1 with a 10.4 rating and a 21 share. ABC stayed in 
second place for another week with an 8.7 rating and an 18 share, while CBS had 
an 8.6 rating and an 17 share.

Emperor Akihito wants Japanese to contribute to charity or the environment 
rather than sending him coronation gifts, and no gifts will be accepted from 
non-Japanese, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Only certain Japanese can send gifts, and the type of item also is limited, 
they added. 
</P>
<P>
Akihito, 56, who became emperor in January, 1989, upon the death of his father, 
Emperor Hirohito, is to be formally enthroned Nov. 12. The ceremony had to 
await the end of a yearlong formal mourning period. 
</P>
<P>
An official of the Imperial Household Agency, which oversees palace affairs, 
said many people had been reported hoping to send coronation gifts. 
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, that Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto declared after 
a regular Cabinet meeting today that the emperor "appreciates the desire of 
people to offer presents, but he strongly wishes contributions to the promotion 
of public welfare and maintenance of a green environment instead." 
</P>
<P>
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said gifts will be accepted 
only from the Cabinet, the two houses of Parliament, local governments and 
groups of Japanese living abroad. Gifts will not be accepted from any 
foreigners or foreign governments.

It started looking bad for the first Soviet football team to play on American 
soil when the players heard the Turkish national anthem played in their honor. 
</P>
<P>
It went downhill from there. 
</P>
<P>
The year-old Tacoma Express, a Minor League Football System team, whipped the 
Soviet national champion Moscow Bears 61-0 Monday night in an exhibition game 
before 1,303 spectators in the Tacoma Dome. 
</P>
<P>
The game was billed by promoters as "Glasnost on the Gridiron." 
</P>
<P>
Bears Coach John Ralston, a former Denver Broncos head coach, didn't talk game 
strategy or give his players a fiery pregame pep talk. He was busy explaining 
how to suit up in full pads. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't forget, you need your thigh pads, your knee pads and your elbow pads," 
he said through an interpreter. "You don't want to land on that AstroTurf 
without your elbow pads." 
</P>
<P>
For the past eight weeks, Ralston has been trying to mold a group of Soviet 
rugby players, shot-putters, javelin throwers and decathletes into a 
professional football team. He knows after Monday night he still has a long way 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed in our fundamentals," he said after the game. "I don't think 
we do the fundamentals very well." 
</P>
<P>
The team is playing four American exhibition games arranged by the 
International Sports Connection, a sports promotion company based in Gadsen, 
Ala. Besides Tacoma, the team will play in Fresno, Oklahoma City and Macon, 
Ga., with a possible match in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
The starting quarterback first touched a football seven months ago, and he's 
the team's veteran. Ralston's biggest player tips the scales at 250 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Ralston had said he mainly wanted to ensure his players finished the game 
intact -- especially his starting tight end, since both backups had been 
detained in the Soviet Union by the KGB the night before departure.

Monica Seles' assault on the top spot in women's tennis was stopped by Zina 
Garrison today after 36 straight victories and one step shy of a dream match in 
the Wimbledon semifinals with Steffi Graf. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison, the fifth seed but overlooked when it came to contending for Graf's 
crown, saved one match point and ended the 16-year-old Yugoslav's winning 
streak with a 3-6, 6-3, 9-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison will face Graf in the semifinals Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany's Graf, ranked No. 1 in the world, withstood a lesser challenge 
from 13th-seeded Jana Novotna of Czechoslovakia and advanced, 7-5, 6-2, to 
sustain her bid for a third consecutive Wimbledon title. 
</P>
<P>
"I actually lost about four matches this year that I should have won, and that 
helped me today," Garrison said. "I decided just to hang tough, play my game, 
and hope the chances came my way." It was Garrison's fourth berth in a Grand 
Slam semifinal and her second at Wimbledon. She also reached the semifinals in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
"This match was so close, it was difficult to be out there for three hours and 
just to lose it on a few points," Seles said. "She had more luck out there 
today." 
</P>
<P>
Martina Navratilova, seeking a record ninth Wimbledon singles title, became the 
century-old tournament's winningest player with a 6-1, 6-1 victory over 
Katerina Maleeva. It was Navratilova's 97th singles victory, one more than 
Chris Evert compiled. 
</P>
<P>
"If you play long enough and play well enough, you break some records," 
Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
The men's quarterfinal field was completed, with the top seed and a surprising 
American going through. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Lendl, the world's top player, came back from an early lapse to beat Alex 
Antonitsch of Austria, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Brad Pearce, from Provo, Utah, will meet Lendl in the semifinals. He 
beat Mark Woodforde of Australia, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison, a 26-year-old from Houston, has had a good year, despite a 
first-round loss at the French Open. She won a grass-court warm-up tournament 
in Birmingham, England, last month and then declared: "Maybe I can win 
Wimbledon." 
</P>
<P>
Not many took her seriously, even fewer when the Wimbledon draw put her in the 
same bracket as Graf, Seles and Jennifer Capriati. 
</P>
<P>
But Graf beat Capriati on Monday and, 24 hours later, Garrison beat Seles. 
</P>
<P>
Seles had a match point on Garrison's serve, at 30-40 in the 14th game of the 
final set, just after the American slipped and hurt her right thigh while 
chasing a backhand into her forehand corner. She got up slowly and in some pain 
but waved off an umpire's offer of an injury timeout. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to give her momentum," Garrison said. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison saved that match point with a forehand drive, then won 10 of the next 
11 points, breaking Seles at 15 on a netted forehand for an 8-7 lead and 
closing the match at love on a backhand into the net, a backhand dropshot, a 
service winner and a backhand long off a big Garrison forehand. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty surprised," Seles said of the final shot. "I kind of don't 
remember it. I don't remember exactly where it went."

Padres Manager Jack McKeon says he has notified team Chairman Tom Werner that 
he would like to give up his job as manager and work solely as the club's vice 
president of baseball operations. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him my desire is to do just one job," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
"Manager was never a longtime goal of mine, anyway. I think a lot of people 
realized I wouldn't be managing here after this season. I was happy to help 
out, and I always said when a time came that I didn't feel like managing, I'd 
let them know." 
</P>
<P>
Werner did not make any promises to McKeon during their meeting Monday, but he 
said he would evaluate the situation and consider the request. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, things are not going like we want, but we don't want to be forced 
into making a decision, either," Werner said. "We'll see what happens and go 
from there." 
</P>
<P>
McKeon's decision comes on the heels of the Padres' worst slump of the season, 
in which they have lost 14 of 19 games.

NATIONALISM IS WHAT KEEPS GAME AFLOAT, DESPITE STALL TACTICS

Surely it is the nationalism that makes the World Cup riveting. It can't be the 
soccer -- the stultifying, four-corners, 
sit-tight-and-hope-we-win-the-penalty-shoot-out mentality that has clamped down 
even tighter since first-round pool play ended 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
The argument that the sport is not broken is the estimate, by organizers of 
Italia '90, that a record 1 billion will watch the July 8 championship game on 
worldwide television, that a TV audience of 26.5 billion will have seen the 
monthlong tournament and that the 52 World Cup games will have been attended by 
an average of 53,000 per game. 
</P>
<P>
But the argument that soccer needs fixing is on the field, where nothing 
happens most of the time and not much happens all of the time. Even people who 
dearly love soccer -- Europeans and South Americans who have grown up following 
the game passionately -- sat fidgeting and sighing in front of the dreadful, 
no-initiative quarterfinal between Argentina and Yugoslavia. Asked late in the 
game if the score still was 0-0, one of the faithful grumbled: "At the very 
best." A 0-0 score gave that game too much credit. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the semifinals began with what appears to be a worthy final four of 
soccer powers: host Italy, three times the World Cup champion, against 
Argentina, the defending champion. It is followed Wednesday by England, lordly 
inventor of the sport, against West Germany, now in its eighth semifinal in the 
last 10 World Cups. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, though, two of those sides are still alive mostly because of soccer's 
vagaries: Argentina (2-1-2) has been described as "looking as though it is 
tired of holding the Cup." And England (3-0-2, with two of the wins coming in 
overtime) mostly has appeared incapable of hitting the water if it fell out of 
a boat. 
</P>
<P>
Even Italy (5-0-0) has scored only seven goals, and four of those by former 
bench warmer Salvatore Schillaci. "Salvatore" means "Savior," and for all of 
Italy's lovely passing in midfield, it certainly needed saving. 
</P>
<P>
At least West Germany (4-0-1) can score a bit; it has 13 goals so far, although 
nine of those came in the two first-round games against the United Arab 
Emirates and Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, winning coaches will not stand still for criticism of their styles 
of play, and criticism is hurled at them daily by the soccer-daft Europeans. 
But the level of excitement has been sinking so low in this tournament, most of 
the talk is of boredom. Through the first two rounds -- the first 44 games -- 
there was an average of one goal per 40 minutes of playing time. 
</P>
<P>
Yet winning counts more than creativity, as Brazil, more artistic than most but 
less so than it used to be, learned when it was upset by Argentina, which may 
be the worst team in this World Cup if not for two brief works of art by Diego 
Maradona -- and Sunday's crazy penalty shoot-out. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the desperation that Cameroon's instinctive play wrung from its 
opponents has given the tournament its best time. But Cameroon is gone now, and 
old discussions of possible solutions to soccer's mental and physical lock-step 
are raging. 
</P>
<P>
Should soccer officials expand the World Cup field from 24 to 32 teams (a 
probability) in 1994, and play single-elimination from the beginning instead of 
first-round pool play? Should they mix the 32-team field with a first-round 
knockout format, go to pool play with the remaining 16 in four groups, to set 
up the semifinals with the group winners? 
</P>
<P>
Which system -- if any -- better guards against playing for ties just to 
advance? 
</P>
<P>
And should they ditch penalty shoot-outs for play-to-the-death overtime? That 
format once produced 17 quarter-hour overtimes in an NAIA game and was really 
dull. Should they break ties by counting the corner kicks in games? Should they 
decide ties by alternating corner kicks instead of penalty shots? 
</P>
<P>
With 1 billion people on the edges of their seats to see the championship 
telecast, don't get your hopes up for change.

ENGLISH REQUIRE SPARK, GERMANS, MORE OF SAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here is a capsule look at the English and West German soccer teams, which will 
play in the second World Cup semifinal game Wednesday at Turin. 
</P>
<P>
ENGLAND -- A controversial top seed in Group F, the English have lived up to 
the FIFA's pre-tournament ranking. 
</P>
<P>
The offense, led by striker Gary Lineker, John Barnes, Chris Waddle and Peter 
Beardsley, has been inconsistent. 
</P>
<P>
However, the experience of the squad showed Sunday when, trailing lightly 
regarded Cameroon 2-1 with eight minutes remaining in regulation, England 
scored on a penalty kick by Lineker and then beat the Africans 3-2 on another 
penalty kick goal in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The experience comes from the several players who played in the 1986 World Cup 
in Mexico, along with Manager Bobby Robson. The team won't give up many goals 
-- Terry Butcher and Des Walker are excellent defenders and 40-year-old 
goalkeeper Peter Shilton has played more full international games than any 
other player in history. 
</P>
<P>
But the English need some spark from the midfield, where Neil Webb and Bryan 
Robson are recovering from injuries. 
</P>
<P>
WEST GERMANY -- Unlike the last two tournaments, when the Germans were lightly 
regarded and made it to the championship game, this German team came in 
considered a favorite and has played like one. The players have experience, 
skills and savvy. And an explosive offense. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany also might be the deepest team in the field. It's defense is 
physical, often punishing. The West German defenders are decisive with their 
tackles, strong in the air and quick to counterattack, and the attackers will 
wear down defenses. 
</P>
<P>
Up front, Voeller and Juergen Klinsmann, both with three goals, lead a 
high-powered offense that has also seen midfielder Lothar Matthaeus score four 
goals. The backfield, led by sweeper Klaus Augenthaler, Juergen Kohler and 
Andreas Brehme, is also tough.

West German players wilted in their World Cup quarterfinal against 
Czechoslovakia because they had been eating too much meat and not enough 
carbohydrate-rich pasta, according to team doctor Franz Liesen. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the result of completely wrong nutrition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The players have eaten too much meat and not enough pasta. The lack of 
carbohydrates caused a crisis in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
Liesen said he had to give an injection of vitamins to each player after the 
match to "reestablish the necessary equilibrium in their bodies." 
</P>
<P>
West German team chief Franz Beckenbauer acknowledged the players had been 
tired during the quarterfinal but blamed it on the torrid afternoon heat. 
</P>
<P>
Pasta, Italy's national dish, is recommended by sports doctors for building 
stamina. Marathon runners sometimes use a concentrated diet of pasta or rice 
for "carbohydrate loading" before competition.

The son of a retired Italian boxing champion and another man have been charged 
in the death of an English soccer fan attending the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
David Monaghan, 26, died of head injuries June 25 after being hit by a car 
while fleeing the two men, one of whom had an ax, Bologna police spokesman 
Salvatore Surace said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested Monday were Marco Gironi, 23, and Federico Cane, 19, son of Dante 
Cane, the Italian heavyweight boxing champion in the 1970s who lost a bid for 
the European title in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, Monaghan and a friend, Lee Richardson, were taunted by the 
two when they stopped to ask directions near the railroad station. Surace said 
the Englishmen ran when Cane took an ax from the trunk of his car. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson wrote down the license number and police tracked down the pair. 
</P>
<P>
They were freed pending trial.

Leaders of both houses of the Philippines Congress urged President Corazon 
Aquino today to reverse herself and let Imelda Marcos come home after her 
acquittal in New York on charges of looting the nation's treasury. 
</P>
<P>
But Aquino refused to relax the ban and accused Marcos of supporting a coup 
attempt in December. 
</P>
<P>
The president found herself politically isolated, with longtime supporters 
joining Marcos loyalists in calling for the former First Lady's return. The 
constitution prevents her from being tried by a Philippines court in absentia. 
</P>

On Monday, a jury in New York cleared Marcos of allegations that she used $222 
million in government funds to buy real estate, art and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
"The acquittal does not alter the national interest and security grounds on 
which we have premised our decision not to allow the return of Mrs. Marcos at 
the present time," Aquino said. 
</P>
<P>
In a second statement later, Aquino said intelligence reports also showed that 
Marcos "encouraged and supported those who wanted to grab power" during the 
Dec. 1-9 coup attempt. The fighting left 113 people dead and more than 600 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
"The return of Mrs. Marcos would enable her to mobilize the underground network 
of the Marcos dictatorship, which is designed to overthrow this government and 
endanger our democratic gains and economic momentum," Aquino said. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Manila radio station DZBB, Marcos said: "I am not 
opposing Mrs. Aquino. 
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to fight her. What I will do is just pray to the Lord that I be 
allowed to come home. I know that he will grant me this, just like my 
acquittal," she added. 
</P>
<P>
The Aquino government claims the late President Ferdinand E. Marcos and his 
associates stole $10 billion before he was ousted in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of Imelda Marcos is, however, especially difficult for Aquino because 
they share such a long and bitter history. 
</P>
<P>
Marcos' husband was toppled by the 1986 popular revolt that brought Aquino to 
power. He died in September in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino's husband, Benigno, was slain upon returning home in 1983 to challenge 
Ferdinand Marcos.

<P>
GOLF: AUSTRALIAN WAS ENCOURAGED BY IRWIN'S U.S. OPEN VICTORY. THAT MEANS HE HAS 
PLENTY OF TIME TO ACHIEVE HIS 'DESTINY.'

As Hale Irwin's playing partner in the recent U.S. Open, Greg Norman was 
standing on the green when Irwin sank a 45-foot putt on the 72nd hole to put 
him in a playoff for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin went on to win the tournament in a 19-hole playoff with Mike Donald and 
put an asterisk next to his accomplishment. At 45, he became the oldest winner 
of the Open. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was Irwin's victory an elixir for middle-aged athletes everywhere -- 
much like Nolan Ryan's sixth no-hitter at the age of 43 -- it rearranged some 
priorities for others. 
</P>
<P>
"You're only as old as you want to be," said the 35-year-old Norman. "It gets 
back to desire. 
</P>
<P>
"That Sunday night at the Open, my wife nudged me in the ribs and said, 'He's 
45, you've got 10 more years to go.' 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Thanks a lot.' 
</P>
<P>
"But she's right. Raymond Floyd won the Open at the age of 43. Jack Nicklaus 
won the Masters at 46. If you keep your mind and body healthy and you still 
love to play the game, why can't you win at 60? 
</P>
<P>
"Hale's win has encouraged a lot of people. It was great for the game of golf 
that a guy 45 years of age won the U.S. Open." 
</P>
<P>
In Norman's view, Irwin's 45-foot putt that went over a mound and then broke 
five feet into the hole was more destiny than luck. 
</P>
<P>
"When those sort of things happen, when a shot hits a tree and bounces back 
into the fairway and you make a birdie when you should have made a double 
bogey, that's destiny," Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
Norman should know, considering the times he has been victimized by "destiny." 
</P>
<P>
There was Larry Mize's 140-foot chip shot that beat him in a playoff in the 
1987 Masters, and Bob Tway holed a sand wedge to deprive him of a victory in 
the 1986 PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
There was also his improbable tee shot of 320 yards that landed in a pot bunker 
in last year's British Open on the fourth playoff hole that did him in as Mark 
Calcavecchia went on to win. 
</P>
<P>
Norman is philosophical about such setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Destiny has been looking after a few other guys," he said. "My turn is coming. 
That's the way you approach it. I give it my best shot. I bet there are a lot 
of guys in the world who wish they were in my position to even get beaten. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to do the best I can in every tournament. If someone beats me, so be 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"You've only seen what happens in America, or the British Open. It has happened 
a lot more overseas. I've played in Australia where a guy holes a seven-iron to 
beat me. 
</P>
<P>
"When I played in Europe while growing up, same thing. Some guy holes a bunker 
shot. It's water off a duck's back." 
</P>
<P>
Norman made his comments in Thousand Oaks, where he will be the host of the 
Ronald McDonald Children's Charities Invitational Nov. 13-18 at the Sherwood 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
It's a team format with the field consisting of the game's top money winners, 
career, or this year. 
</P>
<P>
Norman has already earned $832,709 as the leader on the money list in 1990 and 
he has played in only 11 tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
"Back in the old days, I'd have to work for four years to make $800,000 on the 
tour," Norman said. "Now I can do it in 44 rounds of golf. I'm loving it 
because we're in the right place at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
The purses keep escalating each year and there is apparently no trouble finding 
sponsors for tour events. 
</P>
<P>
Norman estimates that he can earn $2 million on the tour this year, which would 
be a record. Tom Kite earned $1,395,278 in 1989, breaking the previous mark of 
$1,147,644 set by Curtis Strange in 1988 -- and so it goes. The season-ending 
Nabisco championships rewarded Kite with $625,000. Yes, that's just one 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"That's mind-boggling," Norman said, recalling that when he was an assistant 
pro at a golf club, he earned only $28 a week. Now $2 million for a season is a 
an obtainable goal. 
</P>
<P>
That figure doesn't even include earnings from foreign tournaments, 
endorsements and other endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy can make $400,000, or $500,000 in 10 tournaments, which is only a 
half-year's work," Norman said. "Then he might say, 'I'll take six weeks or two 
months off and not kill myself.' 
</P>
<P>
"When I came over here (from Australia) in the late 1970s, I was intimidated by 
the American players -- the Nicklauses, Watsons, Weiskopfs and Trevinos. 
</P>
<P>
"They grew up on the old exempt tour, the tough way. If you didn't make the 
cut, you didn't play the next week. That breeds inner strength. There is no 
intimidation factor now." 
</P>
<P>
With all the money to be earned nowadays by just finishing in the top 10 in any 
tournament, Norman still wants to win. 
</P>
<P>
"Hunger breeds desire," he said. "Your desire to do whatever you want to do in 
the game tells you what direction you want to go. If your desire is to win and 
keep your game strong for another 10 or 15 years, you'll do that. But if your 
desire is just to make money, that will die kind of quickly. It's just a matter 
of how you prioritize. 
</P>
<P>
"Money is great, no question about it. It gives you the spoils of life. At the 
same time you have to work hard. However hard you work, there is some young kid 
out there working just as hard, if not harder." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his acknowledged skill, Norman has won only one major tournament, the 
1986 British Open. 
</P>
<P>
He'll try to win it again July 19-22 at St. Andrews in Scotland. And he has 
been established as the early favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"From an international standard, I think it's the top tournament in the world," 
Norman said. "The sad part about the U.S. Open is that they don't open it up 
enough from an international point of view." 
</P>
<P>
Even if Norman doesn't win the British Open, or any other major the next few 
years, he has time on his side. 
</P>
<P>
Irwin proved that there isn't an age barrier to winning the U.S. Open and 
Norman's wife reminded her husband that, after all, he's only 35.
