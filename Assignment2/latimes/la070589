It was just five months ago today when artist Xiao Lu opened fire with a pellet 
gun on her own "destruction art" sculpture at Beijing's China Art Gallery, when 
Gao Qiang fashioned three meteorological balloons into giant breasts and 
suspended them from the gallery's ceiling to "oppose tradition" and when Wang 
Guangyi placed a sign next to his huge, cubified portraits of Mao Tse-tung that 
declared, "A great figure should be evaluated objectively and soberly." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, entitled, "China/Avant Garde," was billed as "the largest modern 
art show in Communist China's 40-year history," and the state-controlled China 
Daily newspaper said it "testifies to the government's growing tolerance toward 
art." Papers throughout Asia and the West proclaimed it the turning point for 
artistic expression in a new China. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit's logo: a "No U Turn" road sign. 
</P>
<P>
Although the show's organizers could not have known it at the time, nothing 
could have been further from reality. 
</P>
<P>
This week, through a series of official proclamations, subtle implications and, 
some sources say, secret arrests, China's new hard-line leadership has made it 
clear that its current purge of liberalism and pro-democratic forces will go 
well beyond politics and into art, literature, film and journalism, fields that 
were blossoming with new-found freedom before the crackdown began last month. 
</P>
<P>
In the aftermath of the brutal June 3-4 army assault on the pro-democracy 
movement in Beijing, security police have quietly been interrogating or 
arresting lesser-known artists, writers, reporters and actresses, in addition 
to the student leaders who commanded the weeks of popular protest in Tian An 
Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the government is beginning to put up road signs of its own -- strong 
signals that it wants to "purify" and re-educate not only the political 
participants in the protests but the artistic community as well, weaning both 
groups from what China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, has called "evil 
influences from the West." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Wang Renzhong, a senior Communist Party official, announced that an 
often-quoted government policy, "Let 100 flowers bloom, let 100 schools of 
thought contend," remains unchanged. But it must be "better implemented," he 
stressed. 
</P>
<P>
But a more significant development, according to several cultural and political 
analysts here, was revealed in a state-run television program Monday night, in 
which two prominent writers argued strongly that Chinese artists must closely 
study Mao's principles on the arts and literature, as outlined in a May, 1942, 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Unity of Politics, Art' 
</P>
<P>
In that speech Mao declared: "What we demand is unity of politics and art, of 
context and form and of the revolutionary political content and the highest 
degree of perfection in artistic form." It was used as ideological underpinning 
for the repressive Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, when thousands of artists 
were arrested or sent to work camps. 
</P>
<P>
Although few analysts said they expect a repeat, they said they saw the appeal 
for a return to the aesthetic austerity of Mao's teachings as a concrete sign 
of the depth of the current purge. 
</P>
<P>
"The propaganda may be largely cosmetic," said one Western analyst close to the 
Beijing arts community. "But the secret arrests certainly are not." 
</P>
<P>
Sources at several state-controlled daily newspapers in Beijing said young 
reporters who joined in or sympathized with the pro-democracy movement have 
been arrested in recent weeks. Mid-level party officials in several ministries, 
among them culture and foreign affairs, have been detained and interrogated, 
they said. And many artists and writers reportedly are now trying to escape 
China through an underground network that has been used by several student 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
The party has yet to publicly initiate stricter censorship or begin removing 
volumes from the shelves of bookstores. But it has launched a propaganda 
campaign in the bookshops and art stores that is as intensive as it is 
unpopular. 
</P>
<P>
The government's biggest downtown bookstore on Tuesday had sold all 4,000 
copies it had been given of a party-produced, 149-page volume entitled 
"Quelling of the Counterrevolutionary Rebellion." The book praises the soldiers 
who fired on civilians during the assault, in which at least several hundred 
are believed to have been killed, as "guardians of the People's Republic," and 
it explains how the protest movement was actually an attempt to overthrow the 
party leadership. 
</P>
<P>
But a clerk in the store confided, "Nobody really wanted to read it. It was 
bought by enterprises and businesses for study sessions." And on the shop's 
second floor, where "edited" photographs of the bloody crackdown are on sale, 
another clerk revealed Beijing's popular cynicism when she told an American 
customer: "This book doesn't show anything about tanks crushing people in the 
(Tian An Men) square. Don't yours?" 
</P>
<P>
Despite the skepticism, it is clear that the government's subtle campaign 
against the artists, writers and intellectuals who remain sympathetic to the 
movement already is having an effect. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Beijing's artists are in hiding. Those who speak about the purge say 
they do so only out of a sense of continuing obligation and responsibility to 
their cause. Even then, they demand anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Here is how one young woman painter, who was involved in the protests, 
described the party leadership and its new line: 
</P>
<P>
"They are obsolete. The problem is, when culture goes up against barbarism, 
there is no way to have a dialogue. It's like a person trying to speak to a 
snake. 
</P>
<P>
"Under this government's domination and control, I can never use the potential 
that I have. I have discovered thoroughly after this period that they basically 
don't need any culture at all. 
</P>
<P>
"They have left me with a feeling of dread, and they have made the world fear 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the party's use of Mao and his teachings to justify the campaign, 
the young artist, who blends traditional Chinese folk art with modern 
Expressionism, echoed the sentiments of many of her colleagues in saying that, 
like the logo for the avant-garde show, China's artists had gone well beyond 
the point of no return in realizing their freedom of expression before the 
pro-democracy movement erupted on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Mao said that art should serve politics and that artists should express the 
masses' sentiments, but art must have its own domain within itself," she said. 
"Artists all have their own lives, and all of their own realities or feelings 
can never be unified into just one. Every person has their own individuality. 
</P>
<P>
"So, speaking from an art perspective, if there were no individuality in art, 
then it would not exist. . . . If you paint the feelings of the masses, you're 
not making art. You are just a political tool." 
</P>
<P>
To understand the depth of such a commitment to individuality and free 
expression is to understand the popular backdrop that the artists' community 
provided for the student-led democracy movement. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the avant-garde show climaxed a nearly yearlong relaxation of the 
strict artistic rules originally laid down in Mao's 1942 speech. 
</P>
<P>
As early as last fall, poets and intellectuals, with the tacit encouragement of 
senior party members such as former party chief Zhao Ziyang, were gathering in 
dingy Beijing dance halls for political readings and discussions that stressed 
the need for a new democratic order in China. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the first nude art show ever in Communist China, a prelude to the 
avant-garde exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 people attended the 18-day exhibit of nude paintings, which 
opened in December. In statements now viewed as extraordinary, the state-run 
New China News Agency quoted Ying Ruocheng, vice minister of culture, as saying 
the show had "positive social significance." The agency itself declared the 
exhibit "triumphant," adding that it was "lauded by high-ranking cultural 
officials, as well as farmers, soldiers and ordinary citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Barely a month later, during the avant-garde exhibit at the same gallery, the 
artists went a step further, defying a government ban on what the Chinese call 
"action art" -- living sculpture in which the artists participate in their 
exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
Artist Wang Deren threw condoms and small change at his audience as he tried to 
make an artistic statement on China's population of 1.1 billion. Another 
artist, Zhang Nianchao, simply sat inert on a nest of straw filled with chicken 
eggs, wearing a sign around her neck that proclaimed: "All theories are 
rejected so as not to bother the next generation." 
</P>
<P>
The uniformed police at the show permitted it all -- until, three hours after 
the opening Feb. 5, Xiao Lu fired two rounds from a pellet gun at the two 
telephone booths she had built for her exhibit, "Dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
Lu was arrested and the show was closed, but she was later released after 
serving a five-day sentence for public disorder. The controversial show 
officially reopened. 
</P>
<P>
In April, a heavily political exhibit of Chinese Expressionism opened at 
Beijing's Museum of Revolutionary Chinese History, which chronicled the growing 
ills of Chinese society and relied heavily on Western techniques and 
philosophy. In the words of artist Ma Gang, 27, quoted in a government magazine 
at the time: "The appearance of this exhibition presents a challenge to our new 
era, no matter how moderate that may be . . . " 
</P>
<P>
But now, just two months after that show closed, there are no political 
exhibits at all at Beijing's prominent museums.

A Soviet jet fighter flew over three NATO nations Tuesday, after its pilot 
ejected over Poland, and crashed into a house near the French-Belgian border, 
killing a teen-ager inside. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, headquartered in Brussels, 
said U.S. F-15s intercepted the MIG-23 soon after it entered NATO airspace and 
accompanied it until it crashed. They said the Soviet plane was carrying only 
conventional weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet news agency Tass said the plane went astray after the pilot ejected 
because of equipment failure "during a training flight over Poland." It said 
the pilot survived. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the West German air force's administrative headquarters said in 
Cologne that the MIG took off from the Polish city of Kolobrzeg, more than 625 
miles from where it came down. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said the Soviet Defense Ministry was "contacting governments of the 
countries whose airspace was crossed by the plane" -- West Germany, the 
Netherlands and Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens summoned the Soviet ambassador to 
his office for further explanation, a spokesman for Eyskens said. 
</P>
<P>
At the Defense Department in Washington, Air Force Maj. Mike Stepp said the 
NATO air defense system picked up the MIG "before it ever crossed into NATO 
airspace," and the F-15s "were scrambled and intercepted the aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
When the American pilots caught the Soviet plane, they saw "it had no canopy 
and no pilot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Soviet Warning 
</P>
<P>
West German government sources said in Bonn that Soviet officials apparently 
gave NATO no warning that the plane was approaching, and one questioned why 
Warsaw Pact defenses did not try to shoot it down. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to know whether the Soviets knew an aircraft was about to go 
West and why they never made any attempt to bring it down in their airspace," 
he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The plane flew over some of Western Europe's most densely populated areas and 
went down only miles from a cluster of urban areas along the border. 
</P>
<P>
Gaston Bourlet of the Belgian Defense Ministry said the MIG crashed at 10:37 
a.m. into a house near Wevelgem, 50 miles west of Brussels, killing an 
18-year-old man. The house was destroyed and only the MIG's tail section, 
adorned with a red star, was still recognizable. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters fought the flames for more than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
Military officials in West Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium said that the 
MIG-23 entered West German airspace at 9:42 a.m. and that there was no response 
to radio requests for identification. The U.S. Air Force F-15s scrambled from 
Soesterberg Air Base in the central Netherlands and caught the intruder over 
northern West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
After crossing into northern Holland at 40,000 feet, the Soviet fighter veered 
southward, lost speed and altitude and crashed 55 minutes after it was detected 
on NATO radar screens, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Michael R. Gannon, a spokesman at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers 
Europe near Casteau, Belgium, said NATO officials had hoped the MIG would head 
out over the North Sea, where the F-15s could safely shoot it down. 
</P>
<P>
Another official at the headquarters said privately the decision was made not 
to attack over land because "when it is shot in the air at high altitude, you 
don't know where it is going."

IN BANGKOK, IT'S LIFE IN SLOW LANE

BANGKOK, Thailand 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a radio barked overhead, Sgt. Komart Plongkong, looking militarily precise 
in a gray uniform with a chest full of campaign ribbons, punched a button on 
the console in front of him, blew a nickel-plated whistle and waved his arm 
with the casual assurance of one accustomed to giving orders. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly the ground began to tremble, and there was a deafening roar. The air 
boiled, filling the tiny command post with acrid black smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Komart, a veteran traffic cop, stood scowling at the corner of Silom and Rama 
IV roads, struggling to tame the whining, recalcitrant, rush-hour throng. 
</P>
<P>
At Komart's command, a line of motorcycles sounding like chain saws spilled 
into the intersection, followed by three-wheeled taxis called "tuk-tuks" 
because of their sputtering engines. A huge backlog of cars, buses and trucks 
stretching through the financial district snaked briefly forward and then 
shuddered to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Worst Corner in City' 
</P>
<P>
"This traffic is unbelievable," Komart said wearily. "This is the worst corner 
in the city. It's so bad you can't work here all day. You have to get away from 
the pollution and the noise. It will make you sick." 
</P>
<P>
Other cities have traffic problems, but for sheer gridlock, noise and exhaust 
pollution, there are few places that compare to Bangkok, where the cars are 
virtually wall to wall, a city literally stuck in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The congestion is so fearful that a seller of luxury European cars on Sukhumvit 
Road, one of the most clogged thoroughfares, is promoting a special device 
called a "chassis dynamo-meter," which allows prospective car buyers to 
simulate highway speeds in the showroom rather than face the bumper-to-bumper 
nightmare outside. 
</P>
<P>
"On this sophisticated equipment," an ad boasts, "a car can go full speed 
standing still." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Noise and Pollution 
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat, soon to retire, told a recent visitor that he and his 
family had faced war, terrorism and other dangers but could not cope with the 
traffic noise and pollution of Bangkok. 
</P>
<P>
An American homemaker who lives here echoed his complaint. "There are days," 
she said, "when you just don't want to go out in it." 
</P>
<P>
According to government statistics, there are 1.7 million motor vehicles 
registered in Bangkok, and the number is increasing at the rate of 300,000 a 
year. Only 9% of the city's surface area is covered by streets, compared to 25% 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of these two converging statistics, the average speed on Bangkok 
streets is slightly less than 7 miles per hour. 
</P>
<P>
"What this city needs is birth control for cars," Maj. Gen. Kiattisak 
Prabhavat, commander of the Bangkok police force's 4,000-man traffic 
department, jokingly told an interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, Bangkok's traffic woes reflect the darker side of the country's 
economic success story. Thailand has joined the ranks of Asia's other economic 
"tigers" in recent years; for the past three decades, annual growth has 
averaged more than 6%, and last year it was 11%. 
</P>
<P>
The rapid economic growth has caused Bangkok's population to swell to nearly 6 
million. In addition to Thais streaming into the city looking for work, Bangkok 
has become a magnet for Western and Japanese business people looking to expand 
in Asia -- and this has sent real estate prices skyrocketing. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Thailand's traditional gabled teak homes are giving way to 
18-story office buildings and condominiums with rainbow-striped balconies and 
ersatz Greek temples for penthouses. One longtime resident recently counted 
more than 100 high-rise buildings going up in the city center, where there are 
no zoning laws. 
</P>
<P>
"The traffic system is at the oversaturated stage and is very unpredictable," 
said Somchet Taeracoop, director of the city's urban development coordination 
division. "The rush hour used to begin at 8 a.m. Then it was 7 a.m. Now you 
have people lining up for a bus at 6 a.m. If there is a traffic accident now, 
it can bring the whole city to a standstill. It's very worrying." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Venice of the East' 
</P>
<P>
Bangkok, which is not yet 200 years old, was designed around the Chao Phraya 
River. The network of canals, or klongs, as they are known locally, earned 
Bangkok the sobriquet "Venice of the East." Today, the fastest way to get 
through the city is still by water taxi, a graceful, long-nosed wooden boat 
resembling a gondola with a truck engine mounted at the rear. 
</P>
<P>
As the city sprang up around the klongs, the passageways between the houses 
remained narrow -- in some places less than the span of a man's arms. When 
streets were gradually introduced, they were equally narrow. 
</P>
<P>
"The city wasn't designed for cars," said Maxine North, an American who arrived 
in Bangkok in 1950 and later introduced bottled water to the country. "When we 
arrived there were hardly any cars, but there was traffic. The streets were so 
narrow -- you had a klong on either side -- that you couldn't even pass. Most 
people traveled by samlor." 
</P>
<P>
The samlor (literally, three-wheels) was a cab driven by pedal power. They were 
so slow that eventually they were outlawed and have been replaced by the 
tuk-tuks. 
</P>
<P>
There are more than 7,000 tuk-tuks on the streets of Bangkok, and they charge 
about half of what the regular taxis charge. The tuk-tuk is a hybrid, part car 
and part motorcycle, that resembles a golf cart in looks and doubtful 
stability. It has a bench seat in back, a thin roof overhead and motorcycle 
handlebars for the driver. It is powered by methane gas, and photos of tuk-tuks 
lying charred by the road appear from time to time in the local newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Because the streets are so narrow, the most popular form of transport is the 
motorcycle, of which there are more than 775,000 in Bangkok. No plaything of 
the affluent, they can be seen transporting families of five, or huge piles of 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
To increase the power of their tiny engines, many drivers simply saw off the 
mufflers. The result is deafening noise. 
</P>
<P>
A great deal of the city's daily life is carried out along the streets, and 
this adds to the congestion. Along the tiny sois, or side streets, shoes and 
clothing are sold from cardboard boxes by aspiring entrepreneurs. Bands of 
blind musicians compete for space with mango peddlers. Makeshift restaurants 
dot the curbs and spill into the streets, with vendors serving tiny pancakes 
and deep-fried spare ribs from curb-side pushcarts. 
</P>
<P>
A large truck is all it takes to clog a side street for an hour, as a chorus of 
police officers blowing frantically on whistles try to extricate the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, in an effort to clear up the mess, the traffic police 
introduced a system of one-way streets. This helped for awhile, but now the 
traffic has gotten so out of hand that police are seeking to have the old 
two-way system restored. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so congested that vehicles can hardly move," said Maj. Gen. Kiattisak, 
the traffic police commander. 
</P>
<P>
Congestion is also caused by construction, he said, and by the water and power 
companies' tearing up of the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to admire us for getting the traffic moving at all," Kiattisak said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discourteous Drivers 
</P>
<P>
As in England, Thai drivers use the left side of the road, but motorists have 
not mastered the British art of politeness behind the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
"The drivers are very impolite," Kiattisak said. "They have no regard for other 
people. They are very selfish. They are always trying to commit a traffic 
offense whenever they can get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
Somchet, who plans traffic solutions for the urban development department, said 
that while there are several potential answers to the traffic problem, such as 
car pools and limited entry to the city center, the city must first expand its 
mass transportation system to offer commuters an alternative to driving to 
work. 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, mass transit in Bangkok consists of a fleet of 4,500 buses, of 
which one-quarter are more than 12 years old and badly maintained. The fare is 
10 cents. The government hopes to sell many of the buses to Vietnam, which has 
hardly any vehicular traffic, to help pay off the Bangkok Metropolitan 
Transportation Agency's $320-million debt. 
</P>
<P>
New buses are on order from Europe, and officials hope they will help bring 
down Bangkok's appalling level of air pollution, which is attributed almost 
entirely to cars, buses and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
Suthirak Sujaritanonta, an expert on air quality, said in an interview that 
virtually every day sees air pollution exceeding permissible norms in some 
parts of the city, usually where traffic has been stalled for hours. 
</P>
<P>
Bangkok had a tramline in the early part of the century, but it was torn up in 
the 1950s. Now, a private consortium is raising funds to build a "sky train," 
an elevated rail system that would considerably ease congestion on streets 
entering the city from the east and the north, the biggest problem areas. But 
it will take at least seven years to build it. 
</P>
<P>
Bangkok's traffic improved considerably with the completion of a toll-road 
expressway from the airport through the city center. Its major drawback: Heavy 
trucks that might otherwise bypass the city must pass through the middle of the 
city. But the expressway will soon be joined with a "ring road" designed to 
carry trucks away from the city center. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not predicting an improvement in the traffic," Somchet said glumly. 
"We're just trying to keep it from getting worse."

The first freely elected legislative body in the East Bloc opened for business 
here Tuesday against a backdrop of continued political confusion over who 
eventually will be chosen as the new Polish head of state. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 98 Solidarity members and one official backed by the Communist Party 
took the oath of office for the newly constituted Senate and set about routine 
opening-day business, including calling for a by-election to replace one 
Solidarity-backed senator who has died of a heart attack since his election. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Oath of Office 
</P>
<P>
In the lower house of Parliament, or Sejm, 161 Solidarity members were sworn in 
along with 299 Communist-coalition members, adopting a new oath of office that 
substituted a pledge to work for "Poland's good" in place of a promise to 
promote the nation's "socialist development." 
</P>
<P>
Honored seats were reserved at both sessions, the Sejm in the morning and the 
Senate in the afternoon, for two leaders who have taken pains so far to hold 
themselves above the fray -- Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, Communist Party chief, 
and Lech Walesa, the Solidarity leader. 
</P>
<P>
Neither of the two men stood for office in the elections, denoting the status 
that is reserved for both from their respective camps. In the Senate session, 
the two sat side by side as a leading Solidarity adviser, Andrzej 
Stelmachowski, was elected Senate Speaker without opposition. 
</P>
<P>
While this scene, broadcast on television as a national spectacle, was carried 
out, the Politburo of the Communist Party also was meeting, with apparently 
inconclusive results, to decide on its candidate for president. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski, party chief since 1981, announced Friday that he would not be a 
candidate for president because, he said, most of his countrymen associate him 
more with the 13-month period of martial law he imposed at the height of 
Solidarity activism than with the wave of political reform currently under way. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski's withdrawal, which drew a prompt resolution from the party's 
Central Committee and parliamentary deputies urging him to reconsider, has 
resulted in four days of turmoil and consternation within the ranks of the 
party and Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
The turmoil has been heightened by the impending arrival Sunday of President 
Bush, as officials had hoped to have the new and powerful office of president 
filled by the time Bush's plane lands. 
</P>
<P>
Sources from both Solidarity and the government suggest that the conflict 
within the Communist Party, whose deputies must agree on a candidate, is so 
intense that the decision may be delayed until after Bush's visit. In that case 
Jaruzelski, as party leader, would meet with Bush as the nominal head of the 
Polish state. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation on the eventual holder of the office centers on Jaruzelski and Gen. 
Czeslaw Kiszczak, the minister of internal affairs. Kiszczak is a party liberal 
who won support with Solidarity activists for his leadership of the government 
side in negotiations that eventually led to the partially free elections. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a completely open situation," a Communist Party Sejm deputy said. "Who 
will be the party leader, who will be the president, who will be the premier -- 
we have no idea right now." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa, in a meeting with Solidarity national assembly members over the 
weekend, threw his support behind Kiszczak, who opened the discussions last 
August that led to the trade union's legalization. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Kiszczak, 63, seems to have less support from the ranks of 
the party, whose coalition forces will be needed to ensure his election. 
</P>
<P>
In a situation that diplomats and partisans from both sides described as 
"extremely fluid," the widespread speculation was that Jaruzelski would be 
persuaded to accept the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
A proposal by Soldiarity theorist Adam Michnik that Solidarity form the 
government and the Communists accept the presidency was also in the wind, but 
it seemed to have many opponents on both sides. A widely held view on the 
Solidarity side is that the union is not ready to accept responsibility for the 
government.

NEWSMAKERS: WALESA AWARD IS A FAMILY AFFAIR

The celebration of America's independence took on an international accent as 
Danuta Walesa, wife of Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, accepted the 
Philadelphia Liberty Medal on her husband's behalf while throngs of 
Polish-Americans watched. Walesa, her eldest son Jaroslaw at her side, was 
presented with the medal by Mayor W. Wilson Goode during Fourth of July 
ceremonies at Independence Hall. Standing in front of a large copy of the medal 
-- which bears an engraving of the Liberty Bell suspended between the Eastern 
and Western Hemispheres -- and speaking through a translator, Walesa read a 
letter from her husband. "Americans and Poles both have this need for freedom 
and gave voice to this need when they drafted their constitutions over 200 
years ago, but it would not have come into existence if people in our nations 
had succumbed to captivity," he wrote. Lech Walesa, the first recipient of the 
award, will receive $100,000 cash from Bell Atlantic, the Liberty Medal 
sponsor. Also on hand was former Secretary of State Edmund S. Muskie, a 
Polish-American. He praised Walesa's fight to uphold the human rights contained 
in the Polish constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Some friends of activist Dick Gregory are saying yes to his anti-drug 
crusade in Shreveport, La. The former comedian set up camp in a Shreveport park 
known for its drug trade, declaring it a drug-free zone. Coretta Scott King 
stopped by to urge those in the park to use nonviolence to fight drugs as her 
husband had used nonviolence to fight for civil rights. "There is a power in 
nonviolence," she said. "We don't expect it to be solved overnight. When the 
people of America speak with one voice and say, 'This is enough,' we'll do 
something about the problem." Her son, Martin Luther King III, also is 
scheduled to stop in Shreveport to help Gregory's crusade, and actor Ben Vereen 
joined Gregory over the weekend.

 -- It will be an expensive date but not a very private one. A Dallas woman who 
bid $13,600 to go on a charity date with Jean LeClerc, who plays Jeremy Hunter 
on the soap opera "All My Children," is taking along a chaperon -- Dallas 
Cystic Fibrosis poster child Mika Doyle. "I thought that was one of the nicest 
gestures I've ever seen," said Regen Horchow Pillsbury, who was one of the 
organizers of the Cystic Fibrosis Bachelor Bid last week in Dallas. Jan Rogers' 
donation won her a trip to New York for lunch with LeClerc at Tavern on the 
Green and a ringside seat at a taping session of his TV show. SHIRLEY MARLOW

SOVIET LEGISLATURE, IN FIRST, REJECTS KREMLIN APPOINTEE; 
</P>
<P>
OUSTS OFFICIAL IN CHARGE OF FOREIGN ECONOMIC POLICY AFTER 3 YEARS IN POST 
BECAUSE OF POOR PERFORMANCE

<P>
The Soviet Union's new, independent-minded legislature for the first time 
Tuesday voted to boot a deputy premier out of his job, despite a last-minute 
change in rules aimed at pushing through the Kremlin's choice to steer foreign 
economic policy. 
</P>
<P>
The vote served as proof, if the Soviet leadership needed it, that political 
maneuvering may not be enough to get an appointee through the current Supreme 
Soviet. It also demonstrated the importance the legislators attach to improving 
the stagnant Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
The official in question, Vladimir M. Kamentsev, has served nearly three years 
as chairman of the Foreign Economic Commission, charged with setting foreign 
trade policy. He has been entrusted, among other things, with establishing 
joint ventures with Western companies. 
</P>
<P>
He also is a member of the Council of Ministers, the highest executive and 
administrative body in the country, similar to the U.S. Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
But deputies accused him Tuesday of incompetence, criticized him for failing to 
do enough to import foreign medicines and belittled him for an inability to 
speak foreign languages. 
</P>
<P>
One legislator accused him of nepotism, while another criticized him for 
thoughtlessly permitting the sale of raw materials and other national assets 
necessary for domestic industrial expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"Kamentsev has been in this post for a long time, and we know the results," 
said Anatoly Sobchak, a lawmaker from Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
Sobchak told the Parliament that the country's foreign trade performance was 
"disastrous" and added, "I feel Kamentsev does not have the moral and 
professional right to occupy this post." 
</P>
<P>
Kamentsev's appointment was the first to be officially rejected by the 
Parliament, although nine other candidates out of 57 Kremlin nominees were 
dropped after discussion or stepped down voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Kamentsev was rejected when he received 246 votes out of the 419 
deputies present under rules that required all appointees to receive an 
absolute majority of the Supreme Soviet's 542 deputies. 
</P>
<P>
But Monday, the rules were changed, requiring only a simple majority of the 
deputies present, and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov submitted Kamentsev's name 
again. On Tuesday, Kamentsev received 200 votes out of the 419 cast. 
</P>
<P>
The official Tass news agency explained Tuesday that the rules were changed in 
an effort to do away with "a practice inherited from the old Supreme Soviet," 
which met for a few days each year and where voting was usually unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
After the vote Tuesday, Ryzhkov said he would submit a new candidate for the 
post but added that he still supported Kamentsev. 
</P>
<P>
Kamentsev, 61, a former deputy minister of the Fishing Ministry, revealed in 
legislative debate last week that the Third World debt to the Soviet Union had 
reached about $140 billion at the official exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
He said the Soviet Union hopes to recover about 50% of the debt by methods such 
as inviting "manufacturers to come and work in the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
He was interrupted by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who said 50% is too 
little and urged him to "do more work on this problem." 
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Soviet convened June 26 and was given new oversight powers under 
Gorbachev. Its members were elected from the larger, popularly elected Congress 
of People's Deputies. Previously, members of the Supreme Soviet voted as one in 
approving Kremlin appointees and decisions.

3,965 SOVIET JEWS EMIGRATE IN JUNE AS SURGE CONTINUES

Nearly 4,000 Jews left the Soviet Union in June, a new rise in emigration that 
makes the exodus in the first six months of 1989 bigger than that in all of 
1988, a resettlement agency said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
This year, 20,162 Soviet Jews have been allowed to leave the country, the 
Intergovernmental Committee for Migration said, compared to a 1988 total of 
20,082 -- the highest outflow since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 3,965 emigres arrived in Vienna, the second-highest total this year 
after April. Of these, 89 decided to go to Israel, committee spokeswoman Regina 
Boucault said. 
</P>
<P>
Only 613 emigrants -- 3% of the total -- have chosen to resettle in Israel this 
year, she said. Most are going to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Emigration has soared to twice last year's rate, a move seen partly as a Soviet 
effort to improve ties with Israel and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 Soviet Jews have emigrated since the resettlement program began 
in 1971. The largest official exodus, 51,328, was recorded in 1979, before the 
Soviet intervention in Afghanistan chilled East-West relations.

CURFEW LIFTED IN MUCH OF UZBEKISTAN

Soviet authorities have lifted curfew restrictions in much of Uzbekistan, where 
ethnic violence killed nearly 100 people last month, Tass said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The curfew was abolished in most of the region's settlements and shortened by 
an hour in the towns of Fergana, Margilan, Kokand and Kuvasai, the official 
Soviet news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The victims, mostly members of the Meskhetian minority, were killed last month 
in 10 days of rioting in Fergana, Kokand and surrounding areas. Troops from the 
Interior Ministry were sent in to restore order. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Gen. Yuri Shatalin, commander of the Interior Ministry troops, told Tass 
that the forces would be withdrawn and the curfew lifted completely only when 
all those involved had been detained. 
</P>
<P>
Suspects in 30 murder cases have already been arrested and charged, Tass said.

CAMPERS, SOME IN KAYAKS, FLEE FLASH FLOODING

Flash floods forced hundreds of Fourth of July campers out of the Blue Ridge 
Mountains of North Carolina, and some had to be ferried across swollen streams 
by kayak after more than a week of heavy rain across the South. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds more were still out of their homes elsewhere because of flooding 
caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Allison. 
</P>
<P>
The death toll since Allison sloshed ashore in Texas a week ago rose to 13 -- 
one in North Carolina, five in Mississippi, four in Texas and three in 
Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
At least 700 Louisiana homes have been flooded, and about 500 people remained 
flooded out of their homes in Liberty County, Tex., authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Campers were evacuated from three steeply mountainous counties of western North 
Carolina. One woman drowned when her tent was washed away, but her husband was 
rescued. Divers searched for her body and those of possible other victims. 
</P>
<P>
Several agencies and volunteers used kayaks to take campers across rapidly 
rising streams. 
</P>
<P>
The remnants of Allison had brought more than 1.5 inches of rain to the 
mountains since Monday, causing some mudslides. The National Weather Service 
said up to 4 inches of rain were likely in some areas.

CARDINAL SUSPENDS BLACK PRIEST OVER SEPARATIST CONGREGATION

Roman Catholic Cardinal James A. Hickey has suspended the priest who 
established an unsanctioned African-American Catholic congregation, a 
spokeswoman for the Washington archdiocese said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Father George A. Stallings was notified by registered letter of Hickey's 
decision, said spokeswoman Eileen Marks. Stallings is forbidden to preach, 
celebrate Mass or administer any of the Roman Catholic Church's sacraments 
including baptism, weddings or Holy Communion, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Stallings, 41, said Tuesday that Hickey's action would not deter him from going 
forward with the Imani Temple, inside or outside the official church. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not recognize his jurisdiction to determine who we are and what we are," 
Stallings said. Stallings has said that he founded the church because the 
Catholic Church has moved too slowly to respond to the cultural and spiritual 
needs of black parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
Stallings had brought the simmering issue to a boil by celebrating a formal 
worship ceremony at his Imani Temple, in the chapel of a Washington law school, 
last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Marks said Hickey's letter called the service Stallings conducted Sunday "a 
public act of disobedience." Hickey, who is the head of the archdiocese, 
declared that establishment of Stallings' separate group was "a step toward 
separating yourself from the unity of the Catholic church." 
</P>
<P>
Hickey was leaving channels open for any possible dialogue with Stallings 
despite the suspension, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The letter from the cardinal said the decision was made in part to help 
Stallings turn away from a course of action that Hickey said was "destructive." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's ceremony was attended by about 500 people and included traditional 
Catholic prayers and liturgy, along with elements borrowed from African and 
Southern black revival traditions. Black representatives of other faiths, 
including Baptists and Muslims, attended to show support for Stallings' move. 
</P>
<P>
Stallings, who has been on a collision course with church officials since 
announcing his separate congregation last month, said Sunday: "The church can't 
throw me out, and even if they do throw me out, I have my own opinion . . . 
they have theirs."

GROWING ROAD HAZARD: DRIVERS WITH DEMENTIA

The woman, a 65-year-old former psychologist diagnosed as having Alzheimer's 
disease, was not always able to understand traffic signs. But her physician 
thought that she could probably still drive, so long as she stayed in her own 
familiar neighborhood and used her car for such simple activities as grocery 
shopping and going to church. 
</P>
<P>
One day, she risked a trip downtown. Lost, confused and disoriented, she 
misinterpreted a red light and drove straight into a busy intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, she escaped unharmed and did not hurt anybody else. But new 
studies have begun to show that people with dementia caused by such illnesses 
as Alzheimer's, advanced Parkinson's disease, multiple strokes and even AIDS 
are becoming an increasing -- and only recently recognized -- hazard on the 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Major Safety Issue 
</P>
<P>
"It's a public safety issue of major proportions," said Geri Hall, a 
gerontology clinical nursing specialist at the University of Iowa Hospitals and 
Clinics who is conducting a study on driving and dementia. "It's as big an 
issue as drunk drivers, except it just hasn't had the same publicity." 
</P>
<P>
About 12% of Americans -- more than 16 million -- are now 65 years old or 
older, a figure that is expected to rise to at least 17% within the next 40 
years, experts say. Statistics long have shown that as individuals age, they 
lose many of the cognitive and physical abilities of their earlier years. 
Eyesight, hearing and reflexes often begin to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
And, although they typically drive far fewer miles than they did when they were 
younger, the accident rate of elderly drivers per miles driven is second only 
to that of the very youngest and most inexperienced drivers between 16 and 18. 
</P>
<P>
There is considerable debate over what to do about it. Although many experts 
believe that people with dementia should not be allowed to drive, they 
recognize that the loss of driving privileges can be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest day in your life is when you get a car and the worst is when they 
take it away," said Hall, who chairs Iowa's task force on Alzheimer's. "Nobody 
wants to make grandpa stop driving. But these people have the potential for 
causing tragedies." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judgment Impaired 
</P>
<P>
It is the estimated 2.5 million Americans with progressive dementing illnesses 
who pose the greatest danger on the roads because their judgment is often 
seriously impaired, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like putting a toddler behind the wheel," Hall said. "People who have 
normal changes of aging, theoretically, have insight into their condition. If 
they're going blind because of cataracts, hopefully they'll stop driving. But 
in many cases, Alzheimer's patients are not aware of their deficits. Or if they 
are aware, they aren't able to act upon it in a reasonable way." 
</P>
<P>
"These people have difficulty interpreting traffic signs," said Linda Hunt, an 
occupational therapist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis 
who is also studying the problem. "I had one man who saw a green arrow for a 
left-hand turn -- all he saw was green and he went straight. A policeman saw 
him and stopped him. When he realized there was something wrong with the man, 
he escorted him home." 
</P>
<P>
Hall said that Alzheimer's, as it progresses, produces "changes in how the 
brain perceives what you see and hear. If you have an Alzheimer's patient copy 
a stop sign, you often get something totally distorted. It's not that their 
eyes aren't working -- it's that the brain is not comprehending things in the 
same way it used to. 
</P>
<P>
"Alzheimer's patients can be driving in a place that is totally familiar and 
then something happens in a split second -- a squirrel runs across the road -- 
and they're lost," she added. "They don't know where they are and they don't 
know how to get home." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slow Drivers 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Larry E. Tune, director of the dementia research clinic at Johns Hopkins 
School of Medicine in Baltimore, said that the number of accident-related 
deaths linked to demented drivers is probably less than that caused by drunken 
driving because "the elderly typically drive so slowly." But the problem is 
still serious, he said, and has not been adequately addressed. 
</P>
<P>
"The frequency rate (of accidents) is frightening, no question about that, and 
it's unappreciated, no question about that," he said. "There are probably fewer 
fatalities than with drunk drivers, but, proportionately, probably as many 
general accidents." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dangerous Patterns 
</P>
<P>
Recent research confirms dangerous driving patterns among this patient 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Tune recently studied 53 Alzheimer's patients who drove and found that 30% of 
them had been involved in at least one accident since their illness began, and 
that 11% -- although not directly involved in accidents -- were reported by 
their care-givers to have caused them. He said that 44% of them routinely got 
lost while driving and that 75% consistently drove below the speed limits. 
</P>
<P>
Another study, released last December and conducted by Dr. Robert P. Friedland, 
chief of the section on brain aging and dementia at the federal government's 
National Institute on Aging, compared 30 Alzheimer's patients with 20 healthy 
people of the same age. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Driving Deteriorates 
</P>
<P>
Friedland and his colleagues found that 47% of the Alzheimer's patients had 
been involved in at least one car crash in the previous five years, compared to 
only 10% of the healthy persons. Further, 77% of the Alzheimer's patients had 
suffered a marked deterioration in their driving performance. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the study showed, 63% of the patients had stopped driving -- although 
only 42% of them had stopped driving before they had become involved in an 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
"These data suggest that the occurrence of driving crashes in patients with 
dementia of the Alzheimer type is an important public health problem," he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
California requires that a diagnosis of Alzheimer's -- as well as other 
disorders characterized by seizures, lapses of consciousness or marked 
confusion -- be reported to motor vehicle authorities. A hearing is conducted 
to consider whether an individual's license should be revoked. California 
transportation and Highway Patrol officials said that the law's impact on 
traffic accidents and fatalities has never been studied and thus cannot be 
measured. 
</P>
<P>
But some medical specialists fear that the threat of losing a license may keep 
patients from seeking treatment, particularly if they are suffering from other 
forms of dementia that are treatable or reversible. Also, because Alzheimer's 
is often difficult to diagnose, an inaccurate call "could wrongly deprive a 
patient of mobility," Tune said. 
</P>
<P>
Hunt wonders whether "maybe in the early stages (of disease) they should be 
allowed to drive on a limited basis, rather than taking their independence 
away." But she added: "My concern is how this is ever going to be regulated -- 
I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
Many experts have urged families to get involved in ways to keep their impaired 
relatives from driving. But this approach does not always work. 
</P>
<P>
"Families often can't get control," Hall said. "We've had some families hide 
the keys or the distributor cap, even sell the car. One man nearly broke his 
wife's arm trying to get his keys back. She had quite a bit of soft tissue 
damage." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Tune -- saying that "there is a gentler way to approach this" -- 
believes that, if families and physicians become involved as soon as the 
illness is diagnosed, they can prepare for the time when it will be too risky 
for the impaired individual to drive. Laws to regulate their driving may not be 
necessary, he said. 
</P>
<P>
First, he said, physicians need to be aware of the potential of a driving 
problem "and ask about it." Then, he said, families need to devise ways of 
"picking up the slack" to make the transition with a minimum of inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time for Wife to Learn 
</P>
<P>
"In that generation, it's very common for the man to be the only one who ever 
drove," he said. "Maybe the wife needs to go out and learn how to drive. If I 
tell her now, when her husband is only mildly impaired, she can go out and 
learn. Also, if you're given enough time, you can set up rides, etc., and pare 
down the need to drive." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "We've got this population that doesn't want to give up its rights 
and I don't blame them. Most of the time, they are waiting for something to 
happen before they give up driving -- that was the message in Dr. Friedland's 
study. Most of the time, it's a trivial accident, but not always. We've had 
people die." 
</P>
<P>
Because most of these diseases are progressive, families can be aware that a 
problem is coming and do something about it. "You can take care of it now in a 
smooth way," Tune said. "Or wait until something happens and pay later."

500,000 PACK BEACHES IN SEARCH OF A COOL FOURTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SERRANO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<P>
Mission Boulevard was jammed all day Tuesday. Parking along Pacific Beach was 
chock-full by 10 a.m., and police were already setting up barricades and 
warning motorists no lots were vacant and no curbs taken. 
</P>
<P>
On Ocean Beach, lifeguards had rescued 18 swimmers from the surf by 
mid-afternoon. But on Black's Beach, where swimwear and all-other-wear is 
optional, not one rescue call was sounded. 
</P>
<P>
"People at Black's don't get in the water much," said lifeguard David Humphrey. 
"People at Black's Beach do their thing in the sand." 
</P>
<P>
It was the Fourth of July on San Diego County beaches. By day, there was sand 
and sun. By night, several gigantic fireworks displays up and down the coast. 
</P>
<P>
And all day long, unbearable heat in the inland areas of the county sent 
thousands of residents west seeking cooler ocean breezes, and relief as the 
temperature hit 105 degrees in Fallbrook, Ramona and Santee. 
</P>
<P>
The Mission Bay Harbor Patrol estimated that 500,000 people turned out to the 
beach and bay. And while the crowd of half a million -- large but apparently no 
record, according to Harbor Patrol officials -- smothered almost every inch of 
sand available, police surprisingly reported no major fights or disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be primarily a family-type crowd," said one San Diego police 
communications officer, noting that there were no significant incidents along 
the water. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mostly been barbecues and that kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Added Humphrey: "Everyone's been really good. The police are out here in full 
force. We let them take care of the legal problems, and we concentrate on the 
water." 
</P>
<P>
Concentrate they did. 
</P>
<P>
By nightfall, lifeguards had conducted a total of 68 rescues. Again not a 
record, officials said, but still something to keep lifeguards' eyes trained on 
the water, tides and unusual rip currents. And Humphrey said there probably 
would have been more rescues for such a large crowd, but the water temperature 
was only 60 degrees by midday, which he said is cooler than normal. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, he said, more swimmers would have meant more rescues. But lifeguards 
were taking no chances. 
</P>
<P>
"On south Pacific Beach, we've had a high rip current," Humphrey said. "It's 
been pulling pretty hard all day. 
</P>
<P>
"So we've had a lifeguard hanging around in the water out there. But don't 
worry. He's an experienced swimmer and he's wearing fins and all that. He knows 
what he's doing." 
</P>

GAINING CONTROL OF TROUBLED YOUTHS; 
</P>
<P>
TOUGHLOVE OFFERS PARENTS SUPPORT, HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four years ago, Phyllis McCann's family life was like an out-of-control 
locomotive heading for derailment. Without mincing words, the 55-year-old 
Encinitas resident tells horror stories of the physical violence and substance 
abuse in her home then. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a miserable family," she said. "I had two boys who were outrageously out 
of control, and I was out of control because they were out of control." 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the help of an organization called Toughlove, McCann has learned how 
to assert her rights as a human being, and rule her sons with a firm, if not an 
iron, hand. 
</P>
<P>
After her first Toughlove meeting three years ago, McCann gained the courage to 
confront her sons about their destructive behavior and demand they leave her 
home. She admits she was terrified, but she had reached a point where she 
literally feared for her safety. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sharing Problems 
</P>
<P>
"I sat my oldest son down and told him he would have to be out by the end of 
the week," McCann recalled. "He said he was leaving in two weeks, and I said 
no, he had to be out by the weekend. And he knew I meant it." 
</P>
<P>
Toughlove is a support group of parents looking for ways to deal with their 
troubled children. At weekly meetings they share their problems and explore 
ways to lessen the chaos that an incorrigible child or adolescent can bring to 
a household. 
</P>
<P>
However, a common misconception many people have about the group, McCann said, 
is that Toughlove means throwing the problem child out of the house and locking 
the door behind them. She insists that the group works toward more reasonable 
limits for their teen-agers whose behavior runs the gamut from simple 
rule-breaking to substance abuse to running away. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the parents gaining control of themselves," McCann said. "What we learn 
in Toughlove is how to say what we really mean and how sometimes not to say 
anything at all until we've cooled off a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Above all, Toughlove parents are there for one another, she said. Sometimes 
they take another's children into their homes for a night; often they provide a 
shoulder to cry on. 
</P>
<P>
Founded 10 years ago by family therapists David and Phyllis York in Doylestown, 
Pa., the group spread nationwide and now has about 1,700 chapters. There are 10 
Toughlove chapters in San Diego, mostly in the North County area, but plans are 
in the works to add groups in San Ysidro and Southeast San Diego later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grass-Roots Promotion 
</P>
<P>
Although Toughlove has been here about six years, it is still cloaked in 
anonymity, McCann said. There is a modest, one-line listing in the telephone 
book, but efforts to promote the group have fallen on a more grass-roots level. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, Toughlove parents set up a booth at Kobey's Swap Meet at the Sports 
Arena, where they pass out brochures and program literature to anyone 
interested. Also, they have been holding rummage sales and other fund-raising 
activities to defray the costs of McCann's trip to Dallas in August for a 
training workshop. 
</P>
<P>
Very simply, parents are Toughlove. They coordinate and run highly structured 
meetings that include an orientation, sharing of triumphs and setbacks, and 
brainstorming. There is no administration and no membership fees. The groups 
operate solely on donations. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, there are no statistics on the number of parents who attend 
meetings or the frequency of attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Like Alcoholics Anonymous and similar support groups, Toughlove maintains the 
belief that there should not be any one leader. But it is just this kind of 
unchaperoned operation that causes concern among some family therapists and 
substance-abuse counselors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Not Really a Spiritual Focus' 
</P>
<P>
"There's not really a spiritual focus like Alcoholics Anonymous," said Jerry 
Cullins, an after-care counselor at the McDonald Center's Adolescent Unit at 
Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill Wilson (the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous) said that AA would be a cult 
if there was a leader. . . . The real leader is a higher power, God," Cullins 
said. "But with Toughlove, I'm not sure who the real leader is. I'm not quite 
sure where's the focal point." 
</P>
<P>
Cullins said he has referred parents of chemically dependent children to 
Toughlove, but likes to use the group as a supplement to therapy. While the 
parents receive "tons of support" from Toughlove, Cullins said, he has often 
seen parents become rigid and closed-minded to other forms of family 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
Kristin Blackman, another family counselor at McDonald Center, a drug 
rehabilitation center, said she has referred about 5% of her clients to 
Toughlove. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually recommend Toughlove to parents who are having difficulty with the 
Alanon program and really need some clear advice, suggestions and guidance," 
Blackman said. "It's a little more direct support and advice at Toughlove." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Providing Hope, Strength 
</P>
<P>
Blackman said parents have told her that Toughlove does provide hope and 
strength during times of crisis. But as far as she can deduce, "in living an 
everyday life, there isn't much available as far as living the program." 
</P>
<P>
Blackman added that the Toughlove parents she has worked with "had a difficult 
time setting up mutually agreeable contracts with their kids. They (the 
parents) were locked into (obsessively) making their home a safe place and they 
had a hard time taking a real good look at their co-dependency issues." 
</P>
<P>
But McCann remains a champion of Toughlove, and devotes all her spare time away 
from her stock-clerk job at a Target store to do community outreach. Currently, 
she is working toward becoming a regional representative of the group that she 
says saved her life. 
</P>
<P>
"I was ready for Toughlove," McCann said. "I'd yell and scream and call the 
sheriff and not get any cooperation because I was out of control." 
</P>
<P>
"Toughlove really saved my life. It probably saved my sons' lives too because I 
really believe the violence would have accelerated to where somebody would have 
been very seriously hurt." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moved Back Home 
</P>
<P>
McCann's oldest son, Boyde, has moved back into her home after three years of 
on his own. He stopped using drugs, goes to school, works and pays rent, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Her other son, Merle, is an alcoholic and remains out of the home, McCann said, 
but she communicates with him infrequently through letters and phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote him a letter two weeks ago and told him if he called or came to the 
house and he was using a substance, that I would hang up on him or close the 
door on him," she said. "It's the substance that I hate, not him." 
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult," McCann said, "but it's the only way I have of showing 
him that I will not have that in my life."

HASH HOUSE HARRIERS TAKE BEER-DRINKING, ANTICS IN STRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Whatever else it was -- and, at first glance, that was far from clear -- it was 
quite a spectacle. Not to mention that it may well have been the first time 
that 100 people ran through the Santa Fe Depot not trying to catch a train. 
</P>
<P>
As the pack sprinted through the downtown San Diego station early last Friday 
evening, one did not have to be an Amtrak supervisor to realize that these 
probably were not passengers hustling to make the 6:45 to Los Angeles. Dressed 
in brightly colored running garb, topped off by, in some cases, purposely 
ridiculous caps, the group punctuated its passage through the terminal by 
blowing whistles and bugles and frequently shouting: "On! On!" 
</P>
<P>
The exhortation was not a boarding call. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Welcome to Their World 
</P>
<P>
Though they did not realize it then, a few dozen startled Amtrak passengers had 
just been abruptly introduced to the zany, madcap world of the Hash House 
Harriers, an international beer-drinking and running society (and the order of 
that two-part description is critical!), whose members adhere to the maxim that 
it's not whether you win, it's how you play the game. 
</P>
<P>
For the past week, San Diego has been host to "Americas' Interhash 1989," a 
gathering of nearly 800 "hashers" from around the world -- some from as far 
away as Egypt and Australia -- for what is essentially a nonstop party 
masquerading as a quasi-sporting event. If you put Nikes on the frat brothers 
in "Animal House," you'd begin to get a rough idea of what hashing is all 
about. 
</P>
<P>
A version of the old English game of hares and hounds, hashing combines 
elements of jogging, steeplechase, fox hunting, cross-country running and 
children's secret-code societies into a hybrid in which competition is 
discouraged and beer-drinking and irreverence are heartily endorsed. In typical 
hash fashion, one way competition is discouraged is through more beer 
consumption -- a form of punishment most hashers gladly embrace. 
</P>
<P>
"We are running beer-drinkers, not to be confused with beer-drinking runners," 
said Nancy Davis, the Grand Mistress of an Orlando, Fla., hash club. "We've got 
our priorities in order." 
</P>
<P>
Over a single hash course, the runners often find themselves traversing city 
streets, crisscrossing parks, climbing canyons and occasionally crossing water 
-- sometimes with a boat, as often as not without. 
</P>
<P>
Hashers are as likely to dash through shopping centers and office buildings as 
to break through wedding and funeral processions, as quick to pause for a 
mid-race beer break at a topless bar as they are to good-naturedly question the 
birthright of those runners who beat them to the cold beer and rather lewd 
revelry that await at the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
"Compared to hashing, other running is pretty boring," said Gary Albin, a 
Marine Corps officer and devoted Orange County hasher. "It's a lot more 
interesting than running over the same 5 miles every day. The only thing 
predictable about a hash course is that it's unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
During the past four days of runs in San Diego and Orange counties, the 
whistle-tooting hashers and their recurring shouts of "On! On!" have drawn 
bemused reactions from bystanders as they covered picturesque coastal routes, 
sprinted through underground parking lots and tunnels, and ran up and down 
steep stairways and canyons. 
</P>
<P>
One group even climbed through a manhole and, guided by flashlights, ran about 
one mile underground in a sewer tunnel. Because of questions over the legality 
of that underground romp -- and an abiding desire to do it again, regardless -- 
the precise location is a closely guarded secret. 
</P>
<P>
"Hashing, by its very nature, has no rules," explained retired local Navy pilot 
Terry Ede, one of the major organizers of San Diego's Interhash, an event held 
in odd-numbered years in North America and in exotic locales around the world 
-- last year, in Bali -- in even years. "And many hashers feel that the few 
rules there are are there to be broken. But that's the spirit of hashing. The 
crazier, the better." 
</P>
<P>
Hashing was started in 1938 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, by A. S. Gispert, an 
Australian who, like a number of British Army officers stationed there, tended 
to overcelebrate on weekends -- showing, in the process, a greater affinity for 
beer than athletics. 
</P>
<P>
According to hashing lore, Gispert, after one particularly serious hangover, 
decided to run around the padang, the city's large open park, to sweat off some 
of his excesses. Gispert persuaded some of his friends to join him, and the run 
quickly became a weekly Monday night fixture, ending at a Chinese pub called 
The Hash House, where -- somewhat contradictory to the run's initial purpose -- 
the group always downed plenty of beer. 
</P>
<P>
When the group tired of running the same course, the enterprising Hash House 
proprietor began following the pack through rubber plantations and the jungle 
with a truckload of beer. Thus, a name and a proud tradition were born. Today, 
there are about 750 loosely organized hash chapters throughout more than 100 
countries, including nearly 100 in the United States -- three of them in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Hashers assiduously defend their sport's brand of eccentricity as a respite 
from workaday pressures that enables otherwise rational adults to unwind 
through some barely structured irrationality and fun-loving camaraderie. Most 
hash clubs hold weekly runs-cum-parties, with Monday night remaining the 
preferred time. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of hashers are hard-driving, aggressive types who wear a suit and tie 
all week long and welcome this as a break from the routine," said Peggy Wyman, 
a member of the San Diego Hash House Harriers, referred to in short as SDH3. 
Or, as former La Jolla Hash House Harrier Mike McPhaden once put it: "As a 
group, we're irresponsible, dissolute reprobates who six days a week suffer 
under a businesslike facade and on the seventh, show our true colors." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flour Marks the Spot 
</P>
<P>
A typical hash run covers a 5- to 7-mile course, preferably over relatively 
unfamiliar territory and a variety of terrains, laid out by two "hares" who are 
given a 15-minute head start and mark their trail about every 50 yards with 
splotches of flour, chalk or scraps of toilet paper. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever a runner spots a "hash mark," he blows two short blasts on his whistle 
or horn and shouts, "On! On!" -- indicating to the pack that he has found the 
hares' trail. 
</P>
<P>
Critical to hashing's eschewing of serious competition are the check marks, 
false trails and loops set by the hares, devilishly maddening features that 
serve to slow down fast runners and allow slower ones to catch up. In a 
well-designed run, casual joggers running at about a 10-minute-per-mile pace 
will finish with well-trained marathoners in about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. There is 
no prize for finishing first -- except, Albin noted, "getting first crack at 
the beer." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confusion Is the Key 
</P>
<P>
The checkpoints are designed for maximum confusion, often set in traffic 
intersections or other areas from which there may be as many as four possible 
directions to run. Because the next true hash mark is not visible from the 
checkpoint, runners have little choice but to play their hunches and take off 
in different directions. If a hasher runs about 100 yards without seeing 
another hash mark, he realizes that he has guessed wrong and must retrace his 
steps to the checkpoint to try again. 
</P>
<P>
While the front-runners check whether they are on the right course, those 
behind them call out, "Are you?" to which the leaders bellow, "Checking!" When 
the trail is located, calls of "On! On!" and the bugles' blare rally the pack 
back to the circuitous chase. 
</P>
<P>
False trails or "back tracks," meanwhile, can cover up to 300 yards. Coming 
upon the three short lines or "BT" chalk marking that symbolize them is an 
especially disturbing discovery in rough terrain -- and one certain to send a 
shower of expletives raining down upon the hares, regardless of whether they 
are still within hearing distance. 
</P>
<P>
The misdirection attendant to the checkpoints and false trails usually causes 
some hashers to end up running several miles longer than the official course. 
Hoping to make up for lost time, some laggards, seeing the pack traveling down 
a parallel path, occasionally decide to trim a few corners off the course -- a 
tactic that, while encouraged, earns them a shouted "Dirty SCBs!" a cry of 
derision for those who take shortcuts. 
</P>
<P>
Like those runners who finish first -- an equally severe transgression of 
hashing's rituals of non-competitive etiquette -- the SCBs will be called upon 
to perform a requisite "Down-down" by chug-a-lugging a beer at the "On In," the 
finish-line party. But, lest the 50 kegs of beer at Friday's On In give anyone 
the wrong impression, hasher rules stress responsible drinking and permit 
non-drinkers to pour beverages over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
Infrequently, some of the hounds catch the hares -- a rarity certain to produce 
incessant ribbing and, of course, an extra "Down-down" for the embarrassed 
hares. Still, the embarrassment is considerably less in American hashing than 
it is in some other areas of the world, where being caught sometimes results in 
hares finishing the race sans running shorts. 
</P>
<P>
Consistent with their desire to leave normal personal and professional concerns 
behind them for at least one night a week, hashers more commonly call each 
other by assigned nicknames than by their real names. Many of the nicknames are 
graphic profanities or sexual double-entendres that could bring a blush even at 
an over-the-line tournament, where bad taste in team names is the norm. 
</P>
<P>
Among the printable names are offerings such as Space Condom, Dead Puppy, Dr. 
Who, Zipper Burn, Hot Lips, Deep Throat, Mighty Byte, Flop-Flop and Master 
Chugger. 
</P>
<P>
The nicknames often stem from a hasher's personal habits, as in the case of 
Marine officer Albin, aka Shokunashi -- an appellation that he received while 
based in Okinawa in the early 1980s. Roughly translated, the Japanese word 
means "socially unemployed" -- a term that Albin's friends found apt because of 
his habit of joking that he was going to visit unemployed villagers whenever he 
would veer off from the pack to relieve himself during runs through the 
countryside. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Painful Experience 
</P>
<P>
Floridian Davis, meanwhile, earned her nickname of "Slam Dunk" in an 
exceedingly unpleasant fashion by breaking her back after diving into the 
shallow end of a pool after one hash run several years ago. Given hashers' 
raison d'etre, that injury -- which kept Davis in a body cast for five months 
-- raises an obvious question. The answer is: No, she was sober at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Though that incident alone would seem sufficient to guarantee Davis an honored 
place in hashing annals, she added to her already legendary status in San Diego 
this week by proudly displaying an "On! On!" suntan "tattoo" on her derriere -- 
the result of six weeks' of tanning with cutouts of the words pasted in place. 
And who says hashers don't train hard for these events? 
</P>
<P>
Davis' tale (pardon the homonymic humor) is only one of hundreds of anecdotes 
in hashing history replete with the elements of danger, daring, comedy and 
absurdity that are the sport's most treasured commodities. 
</P>
<P>
During Malaya's communist-instigated uprising in the 1950s, for instance, a 
pack of hashers running through a rubber plantation in the rain at dusk came 
across a group of sleeping guerrillas -- and quickly scattered to alert the 
police. A Seoul hasher once fell into a manure pit and almost drowned. Hashers 
frequently run through four-star hotel lobbies and high-brow shops -- hoping, 
like streakers of the 1970s, to get in and out before security personnel know 
what's happening. 
</P>
<P>
Though undeniably an imaginative twist, San Diego's sewer tunnel dash still was 
hard-pressed to match what one hasher described as "the bizarreness quotient" 
of another tunnel experience in the 1987 Interhash in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rendezvous in Train Tunnel 
</P>
<P>
In that run, the hashers were drawn into a long, dark train tunnel where, by 
pre-arrangement, a locomotive with lights on was positioned at one end, with 
stereo speakers amplifying the sounds of a moving train -- causing many runners 
to trip over one another trying to press against the walls. 
</P>
<P>
Hashers' stretching of trespass and other laws has occasionally led to minor 
difficulties with authorities, though no such problems were reported here over 
the past several days. 
</P>
<P>
But two years ago in Orange County, sheriff's deputies were not amused -- 
though they let the incident pass with a stern warning -- when some hashers 
opted to reach the finish line via a short swim through the Dana Point marina 
rather than running a mile around it. And last January in Monterey, police 
closed a downtown block for 90 minutes until hazardous material specialists 
determined that the white powder found on the sidewalk was simply hash-mark 
flour -- a fact they were informed of through a hasher's call to the county's 
911 emergency number. 
</P>
<P>
Though hashing is still relatively unknown even within conventional running 
circles, it has attracted periodic attention from doctors and academics eager 
to analyze the appeal of such non-traditional events. In the eyes of some 
psychologists, involvement in alternative events -- compounded by delighting in 
breaking even their loose rules -- allows participants to project an 
independent, slightly rebellious image. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Psychologically Stuffy 
</P>
<P>
Hashers do not dispute that psychological profile, but they also regard such 
talk as precisely the kind of academic stuffiness that needs to be loosened up 
with a few Down-Downs at the On In. 
</P>
<P>
The hashers who attended the San Diego event were predominantly in their 30s 
and 40s, covering a range of professions. But San Diego's own hash clubs 
include active members whose ages stretch from the teens to the 60s. 
</P>
<P>
Hashing aficionados emphasize that demographic mix in making the point that, as 
La Jolla hasher Mary Anne Curray stressed: "We're not crazy all the time!" 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla club, for instance, also gathers for social events away from the 
hash trails, as when they collectively attended the play "Les Miserables." 
</P>
<P>
"We all looked very presentable and behaved normally," Curray said. "Of course 
. . . we didn't recognize each other."

NOT MUCH OF AN IMPROVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the case of President Bush's campaign reform proposal, half a loaf is not 
much better than none. While it has a few good points -- which are elements of 
most reform plans -- the major thrust of his program would be to move the money 
around, not get control of it. He claimed it was time to free the electoral 
system from the grip of special interests. But his plan primarily would free it 
from the grip of one set of special interests and deliver it into the grip of 
another set of special interests. 
</P>
<P>
And it certainly is not just coincidence that the proposal would help 
Republicans and hurt Democrats. As Bush cracked the day before he revealed the 
proposal: "Well, I have a good reason to want to lock out the status quo in 
terms of control of the House or control of the Senate." Democrats dominate 
both houses of Congress and incumbents tend to suffer from any reform program. 
But the undisguised partisan overtones of the Bush plan would seem to doom it 
from the outset from serious consideration. 
</P>
<P>
For one, it would outlaw political action committees that are affiliated with 
business and labor, but not those oriented toward an ideology or issue. Most 
political observers believe there are more of this type of committee favoring 
Republicans than Democrats. Even so, it would not be difficult for a trade 
association committee, for instance, to reconstitute itself around an ideology 
or issue. 
</P>
<P>
The political action committee contribution limit would be reduced from $5,000 
per candidate to $2,500. Another part of the plan would permit political 
parties to contribute up to $150,000 to a congressional candidate's campaign, 
about double the present limit, to reduce the amount of time a candidate must 
devote to fund-raising. But this provision would not necessarily diminish 
special-interest influence. The contribution would merely be somewhat more 
indirect, and it would not be hard to draw a dotted line from the contributor 
tothe congressman's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Even more dubious is Bush's plan for establish ing reapportionment criteria in 
federal law, ostensibly in an effort to eliminate gerrymandering of 
congressional districts to favor one party or the other. This would be done in 
part by requiring geographically compact districts that cross city and county 
boundary lines as little as possible. Such a proposal would infringe on an area 
traditionally left to the states and the courts. And there are other valid 
criteria for reapportionment that must be considered. 
</P>
<P>
There are some excellent points in Bush's plan. As he proposed, there should be 
a limit on an incumbent's ability to carry over unspent campaign funds from one 
election to the next. The imposing campaign war chest is a nifty device for 
scaring away potential challengers. Members of Congress, indeed, should get 
higher pay in return for giving up outside income, such as speaking honoraria 
that often are nothing more than legalized graft. There should be a limit on 
the number of newsletters a member of Congress can send to constituents without 
any postal charge, especially at campaign time. 
</P>
<P>
The major flaw in the Bush plan, however, is that it does not put any limit on 
how much a candidate can spend to get elected. Until that is done, incumbents 
always will find a way to get a major financial advantage over challengers. If 
the special interests want to get campaign money to incumbent candidates, they 
will find a way. And the only way to avoid a First Amendment constitutional 
problem with limiting campaign spending is to provide a measure of public 
financing, such as now is done in the presidential primaries. A candidate would 
have to qualify for public matching funds by pledging to abide by the limit and 
by raising a certain amount himself, preferably in small amounts and preferably 
in the district in which he is running.

COURT ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, I am struck by how the debate over capital punishment (editorial, 
"The Ultimate Outrage," June 27) misses, in my opinion, the most basic issue: 
Can a truly civilized society legitimize and institutionalize the taking of 
lives? Anyone's life. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, it becomes irrelevant and specious to argue whether it is more or less 
moral, or more or less appropriate, or is "cruel and unusual punishment" to 
execute teen-agers rather than adults, or cop killers rather than 
little-old-lady killers. 
</P>
<P>
I have never heard an argument in favor of the death penalty which made sense. 
The manifest content of most of the arguments seems a thin disguise covering 
the underlying pursuit of vengeance, another example of outcome (ends) clouding 
the issue of process (means). 
</P>
<P>
Why, people ask, should we pay to house criminals over the course of their 
lifetimes? Because society must be protected from those who would do it or its 
component members harm, and killing people is not the way a civilized society 
ought protect itself.

Less than a year ago, we Malibu commuters predicted daily traffic jams of great

'WALL OF SILENCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The front-page picture (June 20) of "The Wall of Silence" (at the Great Wall in 
China) provokes vivid images of contrast in my mind. 
</P>
<P>
Two days prior to martial law being declared in Beijing. My husband, Norm, and 
I stood on the Great Wall of China. In the midst of a crush if tourists we 
stopped to take pictures of three preschool-aged Chinese children, their 
father, and an elderly Chinese couple who were making that incredibly difficult 
climb. Their excitement and animated countenances belied any impending peril or 
violence in Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
These images are deeply ingrained in our minds. Everywhere we went the 
middle-school children, their teachers and supporters were making and bearing 
the red flag of freedom in support. They were bused and trucked throughout 
Beijing in great numbers. Everywhere we went there was great enthusiasm -- our 
tour guides talked excitedly about their hopes for freedom, and listened to 
Chinese broadcasts wherever we were. 
</P>
<P>
However, the great masses of workers pedaled by noiselessly and disinterestedly 
on their endless treadmill.

BLURRING THE LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among the peoples of the developed world, only Americans profess and practice 
religious beliefs in large numbers. This singular situation may well derive 
from another unique attribute of the American system: the legal separation of 
church and state. Unfortunately, the U.S. Supreme Court needlessly blurred that 
crucial line of demarcation when it ruled Monday that government-sponsored 
religious displays are legally acceptable, as long as they do not have "the 
effect of promoting or endorsing religious beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
In the case at hand (County of Allegheny et al vs. American Civil Liberties 
Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, et al), the court held that the City of 
Pittsburgh violated the First Amendment when it allowed a Catholic men's group 
to install a creche inside a court house, but not when it permitted an Hasidic 
sect to place an 18-foot menorah on the steps of a civic office building. The 
court found that the creche was forbidden because it made no pretense of being 
anything other than a sectarian representation of the Nativity, while the the 
menorah, despite its ownership, was rendered constitutionally neutral by the 
addition of aChristmas tree and an inscription promoting liberty. 
</P>
<P>
Writing for the majority, Justice Harry A. Blackmun argued that "the 
government's use of religious symbolism is unconstitutional if it has the 
effect of endorsing religious beliefs, and the effect of the government's use 
of religious symbolism depends upon its context." Thus, Blackmun wrote, 
Pittsburgh's display of a menorah and a Christmas tree was permissible because 
it could "be understood as conveying the city's secular recognition of 
different traditions for celebrating the winter holiday season." 
</P>
<P>
Such a standard, which invites the appropriation of religious symbols for a 
purely secular purpose -- be it political or commercial -- is and should be 
offensive to sincere believers. More to the point, it is an open invitation to 
endless and needlessly divisive litigation. The fact is that a creche is a 
symbol of a Christian feast day; a menorah represents the Jewish festival of 
Hanukkah. To pretend otherwise is to invite the insensitive and the unheeding 
to affront others through subterfuge.

COURT ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shortly after World War I, my mother, a young newspaper reporter in Texas, was 
sent to cover a triple execution. When she interviewed the three convicted men, 
she found that one of them was severely retarded. The stories she wrote and the 
campaign she led succeeded in saving that man from death. She was always proud 
of that accomplishment, and I, as her only child, honored her for it. 
</P>
<P>
On June 26 the United States Supreme Court has made a mockery of my mother's 
accomplishment; five eminent justices, including the only woman on the court, 
have decided that there is nothing wrong with executing a retarded person. 
Shame, shame, shame! I can only be glad that my mother is not alive to see 
this.

GUARDIAN ON CHINA KILLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his June 11 column ("Leftist Cacophony for Human Rights Grows Silent on the 
Beijing Massacre"), Alan M. Dershowitz asserts that China's bloody crackdown 
produced "a resounding chorus of silence" from U.S. leftists. Without quoting 
any of their positions, he claims Marxist papers, including the Guardian, "were 
busy trying to fit the events in China into their political orthodoxies." Based 
on this premise that the left has refused to condemn China's leaders, 
Dershowitz argues that leftists' criticism of human rights violations by 
right-wing regimes is hypocritical. 
</P>
<P>
Dershowitz's premise is false, however. The Guardian, an independent radical 
news weekly that is widely read on the left, denounced the killings in no 
uncertain terms, in a front-page editorial June 14, our first issue after the 
crackdown. (Previous issues included favorable reports on the pro-democracy 
movement.) The editorial stressed "the necessity of incorporating democratic 
rights like freedom of assembly and the press into socialism." 
</P>
<P>
A survey of left organizations published in our June 21 issue further 
contradicts Dershowitz's "chorus of silence" claim. Nearly all major U.S. left 
groups published editorials or issued statements strongly condemning the 
Chinese decision to crush the student protests. The Workers World Party, cited 
by Dershowitz as typical of left opinion, was in fact the only national Marxist 
group to support the repression. 
</P>
<P>
One is led to conclude that Dershowitz's blatant misrepresentation of the 
left's position was an effort to fit events into his political orthodoxy.

SUIT HINGES ON TENANT-SCREENING SERVICE'S ACCURACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Information in a Van Nuys-based tenant-screening firm's computer that listed 
someone with the same name as a defendant in an eviction lawsuit prevented 
Quida F. Johnson of Lake View Terrace from renting an apartment on Hubbard 
Street in Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her unusual first name, there was another Quida Johnson, who lived in 
Lynwood and had been a defendant in two 1986 eviction actions. And when the 
prospective landlord asked U.D. Registry -- a firm that keeps records on more 
than 1 million renters -- to check Quida F. Johnson's rental history in 
September of that year, those eviction cases popped up on the computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
She became, in the firm's argot, a "bingo," meaning that she had been 
positively linked to an eviction lawsuit. But the only connection was her name. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who drives a school bus, complained. She told U.D. Registry that she 
had never been evicted and that she had never lived in Lynwood. But the agency 
refused to tell her exactly what the inquiring landlord had been told. And she 
could not clear her record. 
</P>
<P>
Even after Johnson's attorney sent U.D. Registry a copy of her lease for the 
Lake View Terrace apartment where she lived when the eviction actions were 
filed, the company demanded more proof that she was not the same person, 
according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
July 17 Trial 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, Johnson became one of nine plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed against 
U.D. Registry and its owner and president, Harvey Saltz of Sherman Oaks, that 
is scheduled to go to trial July 17 in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs claim that they were denied apartments because of incorrect or 
prejudicial information sold to landlords by the registry, one of only two 
large tenant-screening agencies in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
A jury will hear testimony from as many as 80 witnesses and review more than 
250 exhibits during a trial that attorneys estimate may last more than five 
weeks to determine whether the plaintiffs suffered damages from U.D. Registry's 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
During two years of litigation over the lawsuit filed by a coalition of 
public-interest law firms, issues relating to the regulation of the $30-million 
tenant-screening industry and its standards of accuracy and accessibility were 
decided by Judge Jerry K. Fields. 
</P>
<P>
Fields has ruled that U.D. Registry, which now keeps its location secret, must 
maintain an office where renters can review their files. He ruled that the firm 
should be as tightly regulated as other investigative agencies, meaning that it 
must verify the accuracy of information that it collects from landlords and 
must update its files every three months. And he barred U.D. Registry from 
linking a renter in any way to an eviction lawsuit based solely on a matching 
name. 
</P>
<P>
"A major concern in this case for us is to clean up the U.D. Registry's act and 
to make them comply with the law, and they don't want to do that," said lead 
attorney David S. Pallack of San Fernando Neighborhood Legal Services. "If this 
case is going to be settled, they're going to have to change their practices." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
2-Year-Old Lawsuit 
</P>
<P>
But Sumner Cotton, an attorney for U.D. Registry, said most of the issues that 
have emerged in the 2-year-old lawsuit are unrelated to the plaintiffs' claims 
that they have been harmed by his client's practices. He said the lawsuit is an 
attempt by the plaintiffs' attorneys to rewrite through litigation the laws 
that they have been unable to change through lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a question of whether this is fair or unfair," Cotton said, referring 
to how U.D. Registry operates. "The question is, 'What is the law?' And you 
don't come into a court . . . and try to change the law to fit what you think 
it should be." 
</P>
<P>
Saltz said his firm has not broken any laws. "We have been operating within the 
law and always have been, and I would be shocked if somebody now interpreted 
the law to mean that we had not been," he said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Cotton said he plans to appeal several of Fields' rulings. 
</P>
<P>
Tenant-screening firms such as U.D. Registry began operating about 12 years 
ago. They gather information on evictions, known legally as unlawful detainer 
cases, from municipal courts nationwide and sell the information to landlord 
clients the same way credit reporting agencies sell retailers information about 
how consumers pay their bills. 
</P>
<P>
With a rent default rate in California of about 15% and annual losses from 
unpaid rent exceeding $1 billion, Saltz found an eager market for the 
information he was selling. 
</P>
<P>
A competitor who recently entered the market, William Bower of Contemporary 
Information Corp. in Santa Clarita, credits Saltz with teaching apartment 
managers that they needed more information about prospective tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"In Harvey's defense, he's done a lot for the industry," Bower said. Saltz has 
shown apartment managers that "if they know about tenants beforehand . . . they 
won't have to evict them later," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Misused Information 
</P>
<P>
But Bower and other competitors, as well as critics among tenants' advocates 
and the Legislature, say Saltz and U.D. Registry have misused the information 
that the registry sells and have given too little attention to that 
information's accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after U.D. Registry and similar companies went into business, state 
legislators began hearing that the firms routinely disseminated inaccurate, old 
information that unfairly denied housing to renters. Allegations also surfaced 
that U.D. Registry, then known as the Unlawful Detainer Register, was gathering 
"life-style reports" about renters' political affiliations, sexual habits and 
other activities. 
</P>
<P>
In court depositions, Cotton and Saltz have denied that the firm ever gathered 
such information. But several industry sources said it was widely known that, 
at least in the past, the registry asked landlords for such information on 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"For years Harvey used to report life-style information about tenants' 
political affiliations, who comes and goes, stuff that has nothing to do with 
their performance as tenants and payment of rent," said Grady Robertson, 
president of U.D. Registry's main competitor, the Robertson Co., based in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
After several unsuccessful attempts to regulate tenant-screening agencies, the 
Legislature in 1983 passed legislation amending the California Consumer Credit 
Reporting Act and Investigative Consumer Reporting Act to include such 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Illusory Protection' 
</P>
<P>
But that bill, which was supported by the California Apartment Assn. and the 
tenant-screening agencies, provided only "illusory protection" for tenants, 
according to a staff analysis written for the state Senate Housing and 
Community Development Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson said the lawsuit may succeed in strengthening the protections. 
</P>
<P>
"This business has tremendous social obligations attached to it, and Harvey 
doesn't uphold those social obligations," Robertson said. "We think tenants are 
customers . . . and that means they have to be taken care of. The legitimacy 
and accuracy of our information is tremendously important." 
</P>
<P>
A key point on which Saltz and Robertson differ, and the issue that brought 
Quida Johnson into the lawsuit, is how much matching information is necessary 
to link a landlord's prospective tenant to a computer record of an eviction 
action. 
</P>
<P>
Robertson said his firm requires that the prospective tenant must list the 
apartment involved in the eviction lawsuit as a previous address before 
reporting that the person was evicted from it. 
</P>
<P>
Because tenants are aware that past evictions can make it difficult for them to 
rent an apartment, they are wary about listing those addresses on rental 
applications. As a result, Robertson said, only about 2% of landlord inquiries 
result in a positive link between a tenant and a past eviction case. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit's plaintiffs contend that Saltz's firm tells landlords about 
eviction cases that may or may not be linked to the person about whom the 
landlord is seeking information. According to court records, Cotton and Saltz 
have denied that they report these "possible" cases. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Have Made Mistake 
</P>
<P>
Cotton acknowledged that U.D. Registry may have made a mistake in Johnson's 
case. But he said the law requires that the firm only strive for accuracy. He 
said it doesn't require perfection. 
</P>
<P>
But they acknowledge that a U.D. Registry credit operator "would indicate that 
there is a case that might apply to the prospective tenant" and urge the 
landlord to investigate further. 
</P>
<P>
In other testimony, Saltz acknowledged that he was aware that some landlords 
refused to rent to prospective tenants based on such vague reports. Fields has 
ruled that practice illegal, and Cotton has said U.D. Registry is complying 
with that ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Another dispute based on the 1983 legislation relates to what cases could be 
reported to landlords. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation prevents tenant-screening agencies from telling landlords about 
eviction lawsuits that tenants win. 
</P>
<P>
Saltz and others in the tenant-screening industry interpret that ruling to mean 
that information about any case ending short of a trial can be reported. For 
example, if a tenant and a landlord settle a rent dispute and the landlord 
decides to withdraw the lawsuit, the lawsuit would still be reported to future 
landlords. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs' attorneys have argued that such an approach is prejudicial to 
tenants and that such lawsuits sometimes are filed to harass a tenant. 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who authored unsuccessful legislation in 
1982 that would have strengthened controls on tenant-screening agencies, said 
it is unfair to allow such lawsuits to remain on a renter's record. 
</P>
<P>
"In this kind of an arrangement, a tenant is presumed to be guilty of something 
merely because the report is filed," Katz said. He said existing law is 
analogous to keeping files on people who are merely arrested -- but not 
convicted -- of crimes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clouds Picture 
</P>
<P>
Robertson sides with Saltz on that issue. He said filing an eviction lawsuit is 
sometimes the only way to force a renter to pay. If screening agencies are 
barred from reporting such actions, he said, it means that such firms cannot 
provide to their landlord clients an accurate picture of tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Fields ruled in favor of the plaintiffs on that issue, but reversed himself 
June 22, saying he had misinterpreted the law. 
</P>
<P>
A third issue relates to the ease with which a renter can find out what is in 
his file. Presently, the plaintiffs argue, it takes a tenant several weeks to 
arrange to see the files. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Pallack said, renters are told only what is in their personal file 
and not whether information from the files of renters with the same or similar 
names has been reported to landlords. Fields also ruled that practice to be 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
But Fields did rule that U.D. Registry was not required to reveal the contents 
of tenants' files to their attorneys.

Photo, Still Miss Acton, After All These Years Miss Acton of 1952 returned to 
the scene of her triumph Tuesday -- but then she was never very far away. In 
the 37 years since Elizabeth Blum Billet was crowned the first Miss Acton, she 
has become a civic leader and pillar of the tiny Santa Clarita Valley 
community. She and her husband Ray Billet coordinated the town's Fourth of July 
festivities for five years in the 1970s. Eight years ago, they served as grand 
marshals of the annual holiday parade. So it was not too surprising when she 
turned up again as grand marshal of the town's annual Fourth of July parade 
Tuesday. After a local Chamber of Commerce member asked the former queen to 
head up this year's holiday parade, "one lady told me I should wear the dress I 
wore then, but I said I didn't think I could get into it," she said. Billet, 
now mother of three adult children, was elected Miss Acton at age 16 after the 
town's citizens decided they needed someone to represent them in the annual 
Miss Antelope Valley competition at the Antelope Valley Fair. Billet, whose 
parents owned a fruit ranch in the area, said she decided to run "just for the 
fun of it." Her picture was hung in the local grocery store alongside photos of 
two competitors. Each candidate had a glass jar with her name on it, and 
citizens voted by putting dimes in the jar of their favorite, she said. People 
were allowed to vote more than once, she said. She later was named princess in 
the Miss Antelope Valley contest. BORIS YARO / Los Angeles Times

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WESTLAKE BOATERS MARK THE 4TH WITH USUAL BALLOON 
BARRAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The water balloon warriors of Westlake Lake enjoyed their annual pitched battle 
Tuesday, celebrating Independence Day by declaring their independence from a 
rule against their annual ritual. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the island in the lake, which straddles the Los Angeles -- Ventura 
County border -- largely ignored a decision by their homeowners association to 
prohibit the Fourth of July tradition, in which revelers in boats exchange 
volleys of water balloons hurled by hand or with special launchers. 
</P>
<P>
The Westlake Management Assn. said the ban was necessary because of fears that 
someone would be injured. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God we live in a democracy," said a breathless and dripping-wet Mary 
Jacobs, who organized a petition drive protesting the ban. Jacobs said two 
security officers hired to prevent water balloon combat gave up after 
half-hearted efforts to enforce the ban. 
</P>
<P>
"They had the Gestapo out here, but it didn't matter. There's two or three 
hundred people out there throwing water ballons. This is the most wonderful 
birthday party for our nation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Hansen, homeowners association president, also expressed satisfaction, 
saying the ban was mainly aimed at powerful, slingshot-type launchers devised 
by some water balloon buffs, and no such launchers were seen this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's OK as long as it's within reasonable limits," he said. "Everything seems 
to be under control."

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A businessman was found shot to death at the entrance to his Sylmar home 
Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Raymond Joseph Godlewski, 45, was shot at the front door of his 
house in the 13400 block of Trego Street about 2 a.m. His body was found by a 
gardener about 8 a.m., said Los Angeles Police Detective Lt. Bernard Conine. 
</P>
<P>
Godlewski, who police said ran a shipping business out of his garage, was shot 
once in the upper body. The gun believed used in the slaying was recovered 
outside the home, but police would not describe it. 
</P>
<P>
Conine said neighbors reported hearing what they thought was a gunshot, but 
investigators had not found any witnesses or motive.

ROSE FINDS SOLACE IN THE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SMITH, Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PHILADELPHIA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tug McGraw stood on the floor of Veterans Stadium on Monday, staring across the 
field at Pete Rose. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, the Cincinnati Reds manager, had just pulled away from the batting cage, 
leaving in his wake a trail of reporters, former teammates and club personnel. 
Rose then retreated to the visiting team's dugout, where only he and his demons 
sat. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, whenever I get my name in the paper over some simple thing, 
something stupid, it infuriates me," said McGraw, Rose's former Philadelphia 
Phillie teammate. "When I think about what he's going through every day, all 
the articles and headlines, it amazes me he hasn't snapped. He must have some 
incredible inner peace." 
</P>
<P>
What Rose has is baseball. For a few hours, balls and strikes blot out writs 
and appeals, gambling charges and the bitter warfare between accused and 
commissioner. The game not only breaks up his day, it's about the only thing 
that can break through the cloud of despair engulfing him. 
</P>
<P>
That cloud forms wherever Rose goes. It's inescapable because his predicament, 
mixed with his celebrity, deems it so. Rose always used to hold court rather 
than depend on them for relief. Nowadays he hides in the shadows in order to 
escape the harsh glare. 
</P>
<P>
So Rose retreated Monday. Still, reporters found him. And the media, including 
this writer, sat, listened and waited for Rose to volunteer yet another morsel 
concerning his predicament even though he has long ago stated he has run out of 
answers. Some days he tries, which those around him say is to his credit. "Pete 
has really done a super job on keepino it away from the team," Reds outfielder 
Ken Griffey said. 
</P>
<P>
Monday was one of those days when Rose seemed out of the energy needed to carry 
through one more day of dealing with such questions. Talked out, Rose made only 
a passing reference to an old intimate in the Philadelphia press corps, saying 
he would do whatever his lawyers suggested concerning upcoming court cases. 
</P>
<P>
Still the reporters waited, just as they have every day since March, when it 
was first revealed Rose was being investigated for allegedly gambling on 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
A lifetime ban -- which some believe is the equivalent of a death sentence to 
Rose -- has hung over Rose ever since. The charges and the ambiguities as to 
what is right or wrong grow with each passing day. Even as he sat in the dugout 
watching his team prepare to play the Phillies, Rose's life took another turn. 
The lawsuit he filed charging Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti with bias was 
ordered out of the jurisdiction of a Cincinnati court that had'issued a 
temporary restraining order in Rose's favor. Now Rose's fate -- and that of 
baseball's case against him -- is in the hands of federal judges. 
</P>
<P>
After the Reds beat the Phillies, 2-1, Rose would talk only to writers who 
travel with the Reds. He told them, "We sort of expected that (the case would 
be taken out of Cincinnati) ... We don't think it has any merit." 
</P>
<P>
Still, news like that can't make his day. What does? 
</P>
<P>
"This," Rose said, motioning around the dugout. "And winning. It's the ofly 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
To call it an ever-tightening noose might be putting it mildly. That it cannot 
be fun being Peter Edward Rose is obvious, written in every crease in his face. 
And nothing makes him smile -- except baseball. Those questions he welcomes. 
And perhaps the only thing Rose does more defiantly than defend his integrity 
against his accusers is keep that one little vestige of happiness intact. 
</P>
<P>
So it was, on Monday, when Rose lit up the dugout. Because the subject turned 
to baseball. That he can talk about all day. That one subject, with its endless 
number of anecdotes and memories, erases the worry, the uncertainty and what 
has to be a world of pain he still has yet to reveal. 
</P>
<P>
Just being in the Vet was enough to stir the memories. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a great place to play baseball," said Rose, who helped lead the 
Phillies to the World Series in 1980 and 1983. "It seemed like this ballpark 
was packed every night." 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't wait to get out here early and play (Greg) Luxinski in gin," Rose 
said, his eyes dancing. "I rode the subway. ... Sure, I did. It only cost 40 
cents and I couldn't get lost. This was the last stop." 
</P>
<P>
Rose talked of his love for the Phillies fans, his hate for the alibis used by 
some that the fans here are toughest in the game. "They don't boo effort," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Other memories flooded back. "Nolan Ryan struck me out three times in a game 
here," Rose said. "I loved facing Nolan because he made you work your butt off. 
He was fun to hit off of." 
</P>
<P>
Then there was his former teammate, Mike Schmidt, whose tearful farewell May 29 
Rose understood, but probably could never emulate. Heck, Rose didn't even think 
Schmidt should have quit. "He was in shape, he could still play," Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
Rose's eyes lit up when reminded the Phillies had not won the National League 
pennant in a while (since 1950) before his arrival. "Yeah, then we got to the 
big one, the World Series," Rose said, a broad smile crossing his face. "And we 
won the big time. It took 97 years to do that here." 
</P>
<P>
He was, for a few moments, the one and only Rose people dearly want to 
remember, the embodiment of a boy in a man's body, playing a kid's game. And at 
such moments it seems all the sadder that it must matter whether he broke the 
rules or not. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Rose can no longer freeze the frame so that only the winning and the 
glory days are remembered, baseball cannot go back to the days right before it 
realized it had no recourse but to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel for the guy," McGraw said. "... But it's like people say. You have to 
be accountable for your own dilemmas."

HOME RUN BY ARMAS A WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Because he owns the most hamstrung hamstring this side of the Laker backcourt, 
36-year-old Tony Armas has spent more time this season as couch potato than as 
Angel outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
But, apparently, it was time well spent. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched a lot of TV," Armas said. "I watched a lot of innings and I watched 
a lot of pitchers. I tried to pick up the rotation of the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, back on his feet, Armas put such new knowledge to practical use. 
Turning on Kevin Brown's slider in the bottom of the ninth inning, Armas drove 
it into the left-field seats for a three-run home run, giving the Angels a 
dramatic 5-2 victory over the Texas Rangers before 62,390 at Anaheim Stadium, 
the largest crowd in the major leagues this season. 
</P>
<P>
Brown had been one of Armas' case studies during his two stints on the disabled 
list. He knew Brown was a rookie, a new face on American League mounds, so 
Armas figured it might be smart to brush up a bit on him. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched him pitch against Oakland," Armas said. "He's a good pitcher who 
throws pretty hard. He's got a good breaking ball, too." 
</P>
<P>
Good enough to strike Armas out with it twice Tuesday evening . . . but not 
thrice. 
</P>
<P>
With two out and two runners on base in the ninth inning of a 2-2 tie, Brown 
(7-5) started Armas off with another breaking ball, which Armas fouled off. 
Then came another, a slider. 
</P>
<P>
Armas drove it over the left-field wall for his sixth home run of the season -- 
in just 48 at-bats. He has appeared in only 15 games, but in his last seven, he 
has hit four home runs and driven in eight runs. 
</P>
<P>
"Tony's definitely a streak hitter," Angel Manager Doug Rader said. "He has 
been his whole career. But he's the type of hitter who can go on a power 
streak. He won't just go one for two, one for three with a blooper. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll make some hard contact and generate some runs for you." 
</P>
<P>
Armas generated three important ones this time after Texas Manager Bobby 
Valentine decided to buck recent trends and intentionally walk Chili Davis to 
let Brown pitch to Armas. At the time, first base was open with Wally Joyner on 
third base. 
</P>
<P>
Valentine's thinking: To play the percentages, get rid of the 
left-handed-hitting Davis and set up a confrontation between right-handers. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no other choice," Valentine said. "Sometimes it works and sometimes 
it doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
Rader wouldn't comment on the decision -- "I shall remain forever diplomatic," 
he said -- but Armas did his part to absolve Valentine. 
</P>
<P>
"He was supposed to do that," Armas said. "The winning run was on third base 
and Chili was hitting left-handed. He'd rather face a right-hander there and I 
was 0 for 3 . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Armas also noted that Brown had broken his bat on a seventh-inning pop fly. 
</P>
<P>
"He was throwing great, especially early in the game," Armas said. 
</P>
<P>
But late in the game, the only thing Armas broke was the tie. 
</P>
<P>
Armas' home run was the Angels' 73rd of the season, which leads the American 
League. Earlier in the night, Jack Howell added another, his 10th, a two-run 
home run in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
"The surprising thing is, we don't have a guy in the top 10 (in home runs)," 
said Rader, who has six players with at least eight home runs and none with 
more than 11. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's inconsequential that we're leading the league, except that it's 
nice to know we're hitting some home runs," he added. "I can't fathom us 
winning too many games if we don't." 
</P>
<P>
All five of the Angels' runs Tuesday night were produced by home runs, which 
particularly benefited Willie Fraser, the relief pitcher working in support of 
starter Mike Witt. Fraser pitched the final three innings, allowing the Rangers 
three hits but no runs, which put him position to collect his second victory in 
six decisions.

Witt left after six innings, having squandered a 2-0 advantage. Texas' Steve 
Buechele doubled in one run in the fifth inning and Julio Franco tied the game 
in the sixth with a run-scoring single. 
</P>
<P>
"He was running out of gas," Rader said of Witt. "He was about done. The 
quality of his stuff was decreasing. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to give him the chance to work out of (the sixth) inning and he did, 
so we made the change there. What we were trying to do was protect both people 
-- to give Mike the opportunity to stop the rally and to let Willie come in the 
next inning without having to face a tough situation." 
</P>
<P>
Fraser got the Angels to the ninth and in the bottom of the inning, Joyner hit 
a two-out double and advanced to third base on a ground out, setting the stage 
for Davis and Valentine -- and, eventually, Brown and Armas. 
</P>
<P>
Armas' hit was a big one, to be sure, but it meant more for him to deliver it 
before such a big audience. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the best one this year," he said with a smile. "A lot of people saw 
that I can still hit. I made a lot of people happy." 
</P>
<P>
Including Armas. Never mind the streak-hitter label. This season, Armas has 
been little more than a streak player. 
</P>
<P>
It feels good to get up from the couch again.

Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Outfielder Claudell Washington was released from Inglewood's Centinela Hospital 
Medical Center Tuesday and placed on antibiotics for the treatment of 
cellulitis in his left shin. Angel trainers have optimistically targeted 
Washington's return to the lineup by this weekend, but a more realistic 
scenario has Washington sitting out until after the All-Star break. Doctors 
will re-examine the shin Thursday. . . . Texas left fielder Pete Incaviglia was 
forced out of Tuesday's game after being hit on the elbow by a Mike Witt pitch 
in the sixth inning. Incaviglia, who was taken to St. Joseph Hospital in Orange 
for precautionary X-rays, was replaced by rookie Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's crowd of 62,390 marked the 20th time in club history that the Angels 
have drawn more than 60,000 spectators to a home game. It was the largest 
Anaheim Stadium crowd since July 4, 1987 (62,531) and the Angels' fifth-largest 
regular-season crowd ever. . . . A week before the All-Star game, the Angels 
are growing concerned over the apparent proliferation of counterfeit All-Star 
merchandise being peddled in the area. The team has gone so far as to schedule 
a news conference today to address the subject, inviting representatives from 
the City of Anaheim and the Anaheim Police Dept. to discuss the problem.

EL CAJON-LAMESA STOOD TALL IN '61 LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES

SAN DIEGO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brian Sipe proudly displayed a moth-eaten blue cap from his days as a Little 
League baseball player 28 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"At that time," Sipe said, "the 'in' thing was to have a Little League cap with 
all-star pins on it." 
</P>
<P>
Note that Sipe, now 39 and a partner in a design and construction business in 
Encinitas, didn't haul out a helmet from his days as an outstanding quarterback 
for San Diego State and the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly Sipe would have had reason to reflect with pleasure on his football 
career. He was with the Browns from 1974 through 1983, and in 1980 was the 
highest ranked quarterback in the National Football League, a Pro Bowl 
selection and The Sporting News player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Then why did a beat-up baseball cap with a bunch of pins on it have so much 
significance for a former football star? 
</P>
<P>
Sipe happens to be one of those rare athletes, or ex-athletes, to whom success 
as a pro isn't the biggest thing in life. To him, nothing that happened in high 
school, college or pro football could quite compare with the thrill of being a 
member of the El Cajon-LaMesa Northern Little League All-Star team that won the 
Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa., in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're young, you're full of dreams," Sipe said. "You fantasize about 
being in the Little League World Series. That's what made it stand out in my 
sports career. 
</P>
<P>
"The sheer joy of sport, with no outside factors, no contracts, no roster to 
make. Just playing as well as you could and having fun. It's a real luxury that 
young athletes have." 
</P>
<P>
Sipe played a very small role in El Cajon-LaMesa's drive to the championship. 
He was the only 11-year-old on the team -- all others were the maximum age of 
12 -- and was a backup catcher, pitcher and outfielder. He batted just once in 
the tournament, reaching base on an error. 
</P>
<P>
Still, just being there was something Sipe will always treasure. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty intimidated," he said. "The one time I batted, I was so shook up 
that after every pitch, I made the sign of the cross. I was never that nervous 
as a pro quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
Sipe told about a guest appearance at Williamsport by Hall of Famer Ted 
Williams, an alumnus of Hoover High School and a former member of the 
minor-league Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"He presented all of us with baseball gloves," Sipe said. "They invited him to 
hit the opening pitch, and he deliberately missed it. All of us stood in 
stunned silence when we saw one of the greatest hitters of all time miss a 
pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Then could the Little League tournament have been the most rewarding experience 
of Sipe's life? 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yes," he said. "There's no question about it." 
</P>
<P>
If it was that big a deal to a rarely used reserve, think how much it meant to 
Mike Salvatore. 
</P>
<P>
Salvatore won both the semifinal and final games with last-inning home runs. On 
top of that, he pitched a three-hitter and struck out 11 in the quarterfinal 
game and pitched five hitless innings in the final. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike was definitely the most valuable player in the tournament," said Chico 
Leonard, the team's second baseman, who is now a carpenter in Lakeside. 
</P>
<P>
Strangely, the names of the two towns that the champions represented never 
appeared on their uniforms. In preliminary play, their uniform shirts read 
"Northern," for the local Little League from which they were chosen as 
all-stars. In the Little League World Series, their shirts read "West," because 
they had won the West Regional. 
</P>
<P>
El Cajon-LaMesa swept through nine games to get to Williamsport, and needed 
three more victories there to take home the title. 
</P>
<P>
The luck of the draw didn't do the San Diegans any favors. They had to make 
their debut against the defending champions from Levittown, Pa. Neither team 
could score in the regulation six innings, but in the seventh, Todd Lieber's 
home run gave El Cajon-LaMesa a 1-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"They were the local team, so everybody there wanted them to win," Leonard 
said. "We broke their hearts when we won. Lieber didn't hit home runs during 
the season, but he came along when it counted. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, Todd's parents arrived just after he hit the home run to win 
the game. They drove, and they were delayed on the way." 
</P>
<P>
Next came Hilo, Hawaii, and another extra-inning game. Mickey Alasantro's home 
run in the fifth sent El Cajon-LaMesa ahead, 2-1, only to have Hilo tie the 
score in the sixth. Salvatore finally won it with a home run in the eighth, 
3-2. The late Beau Barrett went all the way for the victory and the boys from 
San Diego were only a step away from glory. 
</P>
<P>
El Campo, Tex., now stood in the way after knocking off the tournament 
favorites from Monterrey, Mexico, in the semifinals, 1-0. The Texans took a 2-1 
lead in the fourth on two unearned runs, but Salvatore's three-run homer in the 
sixth gave the Californians a 4-2 victory and the championship. 
</P>
<P>
Salvatore, now a real estate appraiser in Ramona, didn't remember his 
game-winning home run in the semifinals. He was surprised to read about it when 
he dug up a box of musty clippings in his home. 
</P>
<P>
However, Salvatore had no trouble recalling how he ended the game that made his 
team No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
"We were so intense," he said. "We were sure we were going to lose. Half the 
team was crying. I just went up there to make contact, but I really hit the 
ball well. I didn't stop to watch it, but people told me it cleared the 
center-field fence by a big margin. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so excited that I didn't realize the game was over. I just thought, 
'Here we go. All right. We're still in the game.' It was a matter of survival. 
Then as I rounded third, everybody was waiting for me at home plate, and they 
carried me off the field. All of a sudden I knew it was the game." 
</P>
<P>
Almost obscured by the exciting finish was the fact that Salvatore and 
Alasantro combined for a no-hitter. 
</P>
<P>
Salvatore had to be taken out after five innings, during which he yielded the 
two unearned runs while striking out five, because of the limit of 12 innings 
per week. In the sixth, he moved to left field and Alasantro, who had been 
playing first base, went in to pitch. Alasantro retired the side in order, and 
Salvatore's home run made him the winning pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember making a shoestring catch after going to left field," Salvatore 
said. "I was pretty proud of that play, because the game was on 'Wide World of 
Sports.' " 
</P>
<P>
Alasantro and Lieber began the big final inning with singles off El Campo 
pitcher Phil Winfield. Leonard was due to bat next, but Lee Townsley batted for 
him and struck out. Then Salvatore hit Winfield's 2-0 pitch out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
Don Dolan, 70, of LaMesa, a retired PSA pilot who was co-manager of the team 
with Jim Pursley, talked about the magic moment. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked pretty dismal, but the kids didn't give up," Dolan said. "After we 
got two runners on base, I put Townsley in to pinch-hit because he had power 
and to avoid a double play. I told him to swing for the fence, that I didn't 
care if he struck out because we had Salvatore coming up next. He did strike 
out, but Mike came through for us." 
</P>
<P>
As great a tournament as Salvatore had, El Cajon-LaMesa won largely because it 
was team-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
"We believed in our managers and they believed in us," Leonard said. "Our 
experience proved that a good thing can definitely teach you a lesson." 
</P>
<P>
Of the other players, none was more instrumental than Alasantro. His home run 
in the semifinal game and his relief pitching and leadoff hit in the final all 
were essential to the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, the home run was a thrill," said Alasantro, now in the ceramic-tile 
business in Cardiff. "Then to help win the championship game was the topper. It 
was the only inning I pitched in the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
Both managers had sons on the team, Jim Dolan and Rick Pursley. Rounding out 
the roster were Carl Buffo, Rodger Cargin, John Teischer, Gene Okrusch and Joel 
Ventre. Steve Jupin, the 15th member, missed the trip because of illness in his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
When the victorious Little Leaguers returned home, they took a commercial 
flight to Los Angeles, where they transferred to a PSA charter piloted by the 
elder Dolan, who had flown back earlier. They landed at Gillespie Field in El 
Cajon, and a big celebration followed. 
</P>
<P>
"All the parents who hadn't gone to Williamsport were on the charter," Dolan 
said. "There was a big welcoming party in San Diego, dignitaries, quite a 
program. The players paraded around town on a fire truck." 
</P>
<P>
Salvatore felt that El Cajon-LaMesa lucked out when El Campo upset the Mexican 
team in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
"We were really shaky at the prospect of playing Mexico," Salvatore said. 
"Their guys looked so much older." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the biggest break the San Diegans got was that Salvatore wasn't born 
one day earlier. Aug. 1 was his 13th birthday, and July 31 was the cutoff date 
for Little League eligibility. Leonard was another near-miss, turning 13 on 
Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
These days, Salvatore plays in a Senior League in which he has distinguished 
company. Also in the league are Rollie Fingers and Graig Nettles, longtime 
major leaguers whose careers included stints with the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Dolan, an instrument technician in LaMesa, was El Cajon-LaMesa's shortstop 
and teamed with Leonard to form a strong double-play combination. He saved the 
semifinal game against Hilo when he cut off a possible run with a diving 
backhand stop. 
</P>
<P>
The younger Dolan told about his father's advice not to try to hit the long 
ball -- except in the case of Townsley in the final. 
</P>
<P>
"It was ironic, because we had a lot of power," Dolan said. "Dad said, 'You'll 
never win a game with a home run. Just try to make contact.' Yet of the 14 
games we won on the way to the championship, we won four or five on home runs 
(actually, six of the final eight). Barrett, Alasantro and Lieber hit five home 
runs apiece, and Cargin hit four." 
</P>
<P>
Much has been said and written about the negative aspects of Little League; 
parents pushing their boys too hard or meddling in the managers' business. The 
senior Dolan said he hadn't encountered any major problems of that kind. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the greatest experience I've had in my life," Dolan said. "We did catch 
some flak from parents, but it was nothing serious, just snide remarks about 
who should be playing. My only response was that as long as we were winning, we 
wouldn't change a thing. We never had a disgruntled boy in the dugout." 
</P>
<P>
Sipe put in as much bench time as anybody on the team, but said, "My parents 
were strictly spectators, and our managers taught us to work hard and 
concentrate. We really had fun." 
</P>

Joe Magrane seems to be gaining an appreciation for his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
Magrane pitched a five-hitter for his third straight victory as the St. Louis 
Cardinals beat the Los Angeles Dodgers, 2-1, Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It keeps everybody in the game," Ozzie Smith said of Magrane's effort. "His 
last two outings have been very indicative of what can happen if he allows the 
guys behind him to play." 
</P>
<P>
Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog said Magrane needed only 76 pitches to get 
through the first eight innings of the game, which was played in two hours and 
12 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"He threw 12 in the ninth. He threw 10 of them to (Mike) Marshall," Herzog 
said. "He's capable of going out there and throwing that kind of game every 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Magrane, who has been bothered intermittenly by tender elbow, relied heavily on 
his fastball to beat Los Angeles for the second time this season. 
</P>
<P>
"He proved you don't have to strike everybody out to win; you've just got to 
get them out," Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda said. "Magrane kept the ball down 
and got ahead of the hitters." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals scored two runs in the first inning off Fernando Valenzuela, 4-7. 
Jose Oquendo followed Vince Coleman's double and 44th consecutive successful 
stolen base with a sacrifice fly. Ozzie Smith then doubled and scored on Pedro 
Guerrero's single. 
</P>
<P>
Magrane, while lowering his earned-run average to 3.24, struck out one and 
walked two en route to his fourth complete game in his last six starts. 
</P>
<P>
Since coming off the disabled list on April 30, Magrane has a 7-4 record and a 
1.85 ERA. Overall, he is 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's one thing I really want to do it's be able to win all the close 
games," Magrane said. "That can't happen all the time, but I can do a better 
job than I was before." 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Hatcher tripled with two outs in the first inning on a drive that got 
past Milt Thompson in right-center and scored on a wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Cardinals' fourth victory in five games. The Dodgers lost for the 
fifth time in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrero's RBI was only his third in 17 games. Coleman, who was last caught 
stealing on a pickoff play last Sept. 15, has stolen 38 bases -- tops in the 
major leagues -- this season. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela allowed four hits and struck out six before leaving for a 
pinch-hitter in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way we can win games , since we're not hitting, is to pitch a 
shutout," Lasorda said in describing Los Angeles' biggest problem. "Fernando 
pitched a good game, but we're not hitting."

AFTER EASY DRAW, CHAMBERLIN GETS BECKER

<P>
Until now, until Boris Becker, Paul Chamberlin has lived a charmed life to the 
quarterfinals at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
It has been nice getting this far without playing a seeded player, but that's 
over for Chamberlin. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the 27-year-old from Del Mar isn't overwhelmed with the task ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just out there," he said. "They say this guy is just great and sure he's 
got a great serve, but he puts his pants on one leg at a time." 
</P>
<P>
That's true, but the person in those pants is a two-time Wimbledon champion. 
After four matches, Chamberlin hasn't had to worry about beating anyone of 
Becker's caliber. 
</P>
<P>
Chamberlin advanced to the quarterfinals with a victory over Leif Shiras of 
Milwaukee and has not played anyone ranked higher than 101. Becker is No. 2 in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
"When I looked at the draw, I figured I had a pretty good shot to get where I 
am now," Chamberlin said. "The only seeds I had to worry about were (Jakob) 
Hlasek and (Kevin) Curren, and they weren't exactly (Stefan) Edberg and (John) 
McEnroe." 
</P>
<P>
Luckily enough, for him, both Hlasek and Curren lost early. 
</P>
<P>
Born in Toledo, Ohio, Chamberlin grew up in Newport Beach and graduated from 
Foothill High School in Santa Ana. He spent one year at Foothill Community 
College in Los Altos Hills, where he played as the No. 2 player behind Brad 
Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
Chamberlin transferred to the University of Arizona, where he was an 
All-American in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, Chamberlin decided to rededicate himself to tennis and began with 
a quarterfinal appearance in Tokyo. Along the way he scored his biggest victory 
by beating Slobodan Zivojinovic. 
</P>
<P>
That's not Boris Becker, however. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I've got a pretty good shot at it if I have my composure," Chamberlin 
said.

Angel Cordero rode Dancing Spree to a neck victory Tuesday in the $431,200 
Suburban Handicap for 3-year-olds and up at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
The Suburban Handicap is the second leg of the New York Racing Assn.'s handicap 
triple crown. Proper Reality, who did not compete in the Suburban, won the 
first leg, the Metropolitan Mile, on May 29. The third leg, the Brooklyn, will 
be run July 22. 
</P>
<P>
It was also the third victory in nine starts this year for the 4-year-old son 
of Nijinsky II-Blitey. He earned $258,720 for Ogden Phipps after covering 1 1/4 
miles in 2:02 2/5. 
</P>
<P>
Forever Silver, ridden by Jacinto Vasquez, was second in the field of 12, 1 1/2 
lengths ahead of Easy N Dirty and Richard Migliore. 
</P>
<P>
Cryptoclearance, the favorite, lagged early and finished seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Dancing Spree returned $8.40, $5.20 and $3.80. Forever Silver paid $5.60 and 
$4.40, and Easy N Dirty returned $5.40.

<P>
Thon hit a drive to right-center field that went to the wall. One out later, 
pinch-hitter Steve Jeltz singled to score Thon and chase Browning (7-6). John 
Franco got the last two outs for his 22nd save. 
</P>
<P>
Browning pitched a perfect game last Sept. 16 against the Dodgers at 
Cincinnati. He missed another no-hitter this season when San Diego's Tony Gwynn 
singled with one out in the ninth on June 6. 
</P>
<P>
For eight innings, the Reds had only two tough plays to make on defense. 
</P>
<P>
In the first, third baseman Lenny Harris dove to his left and gloved Tom Herr's 
smash, straightened up and threw out the runner. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the third, on Browning's only 3-2 count, Len Dykstra hit a line 
drive that first baseman Todd Benzinger speared. 
</P>
<P>
Browning contributed a fine defensive play of his own in the fourth inning, 
when he caught a smash by Dykstra that appeared headed for center field. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds took a 2-0 lead in the first with the help of a pair of walks off 
Terry Mulholland (1-3). Harris led off with a walk and scored on Kal Daniels' 
double, Daniels taking third on the throw home. One out later, Eric Davis 
walked and Paul O'Neill hit into a fielder's choice that scored Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
On May 2 last season, Ron Robinson of the Reds was one out away from a perfect 
game against Montreal. Wallace Johnson broke that up with a pinch single.

COLIN FLETCHER, GRANDFATHER OF BACKPACKING, SEES NEED FOR CHANGE

<TEXT>
<P>
Colin Fletcher has traveled the world and into himself, recounting his findings 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
After years of leading readers across steaming deserts, through moonlit meadows 
and up wind-swept mountains, there is one animal he has come to fear: man. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you have walked for a quorum of years . . . you accept, with more than 
just your intellect, that man is an animal," he writes in his new book, "The 
Secret Worlds of Colin Fletcher." "A very special animal, for sure, but still 
an animal." 
</P>
<P>
And because man is wreaking havoc with other species, Fletcher has reached a 
jarring conclusion he expects will shock armchair hikers who know him as the 
grandfather of backpacking. 
</P>
<P>
What this planet needs, he says, is a plague that would kill off most of the 
human population and get it down to one or two billion again. 
</P>
<P>
"Theoretically, a plague would do wonderful things to the planet," he said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Oil spills and strip mining would end, he said. Acid rain would abate, the 
ozone hole would shrink and disappear, lost rain forests would return. 
</P>
<P>
This is an older and less carefree Fletcher than the one who introduced many 
Americans to the pleasures of the backcountry in "The Thousand-Mile Summer" 25 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
His new book is his latest testament to the joys of walking. It meanders off on 
solitary jaunts through unnamed, untamed locales, extolling Fletcher's familiar 
philosophy that nothing stimulates clear thinking like a wilderness walk. 
</P>
<P>
But these secret worlds are meant more to be analyzed than camped in. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not really interested in encouraging people to get out there," he said. "I 
want to change their views of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, 67, lives with a foot in two worlds in the far outer reaches of the 
San Francisco Bay area -- "shruburbia," as he calls it. He guards his seclusion 
with the same ferocity he once displayed in leading a successful fight against 
local land developers, granting an interview only after extracting a promise 
that his hometown is not identified. 
</P>
<P>
A decoy name is on his mailbox, and a crudely lettered "Beware of the Man!" 
sign warns visitors who dare approach his front door. The gruff Welshman has 
been called the J.D. Salinger of the high country. 
</P>
<P>
Met on his own terms, however, he is hospitable, sharing anecdotes and trail 
mix with a visitor as red-tailed hawks soar above the tree-covered valley his 
home overlooks. Thick, black-rimmed glasses combined with a white beard give 
him an owlish, scholarly look, but he has sturdy legs and robust energy. 
</P>
<P>
Fletcher inherited a love for walking from his mother, who especially liked 
walks in the rain. His first experience with a backpack was as a commando for 
the Royal Marines in World War II. The yen for writing surfaced later, when he 
spent five years in East Africa, mostly as a farmer, and wrote 70,000 words of 
an "awful" novel that has never been published. 
</P>
<P>
After three years in Canada as a construction worker and prospector, among 
other jobs, he moved to California in 1956 and hit upon the idea of walking the 
length of California from Mexico to Oregon. The route took him across the 
Mojave Desert and Death Valley and up the Sierra Nevada range to wide acclaim 
with "The Thousand-Mile Summer." 
</P>
<P>
The tale of a wilderness trek was the first of its genre, but it happened 
almost by accident. 
</P>
<P>
"The main reason I did 'The Thousand-Mile Summer' was to decide whether to 
marry the woman I was living with," he said. "I got the idea in the middle of 
the night." 
</P>
<P>
Results were mixed: The two were married shortly after the walk in 1958 and got 
a divorce, Fletcher's second, within months (he now lives alone). But he had 
developed his trademark as a writer. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963 he undertook another solo trek, becoming the first person known to have 
walked the length of the Grand Canyon within the rim. The trip was the subject 
of "The Man Who Walked Through Time." He sealed his reputation as a premier 
walker-writer in 1968 with the first edition of "The Complete Walker," a mostly 
how-to book that became the backpacker's bible. 
</P>
<P>
"The Winds of Mara" and "The Man From The Cave" took the nature exploration 
theme further. 
</P>
<P>
In all his books, he provides what he calls "great, granular detail" about 
camping. A squirrel rasps up a ponderosa pine, the pot on the stove mutters and 
a breeze flows down the canyon as Fletcher deliberately sets up camp with us 
before snuggling into his sleeping bag -- a sort of backpacking play-by-play 
for less adventuresome readers. 
</P>
<P>
Today he admits it's more difficult to convey a sense of wonder about his other 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not young any more," he said. "I'm no longer rich with the rewards of 
inexperience." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Fletcher is going on a six-month river rafting trip, the destination -- of 
course -- a secret. Even though he believes the green world he loves is being 
ruined, he doesn't intend to sit by harrumphing idly while it decays. 
</P>
<P>
Not yet, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, all right, maybe man had to be stopped . . . but that did not mean that 
I, personally, must bang or whimper my way out," he writes in "Secret Worlds." 
</P>
<P>
"I could still give myself up -- sometimes, anyway -- to enjoying the world's 
human joys: making love, listening to Beethoven conducted by Furtwangler, 
executing a perfectly disguised backhand drop shot from the baseline." 
</P>
<P>
And walking, no less boldly, in search of old truths and new adventures.

Russ Francis, tight end for the New England Patriots, has been freed on $2,800 
bail after his arrest in Nevada for alleged drunk driving and alleged carrying 
of a concealed weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Francis, a 13-year National Football League veteran, was allegedly riding his 
motorcycle 58 m.p.h in a 45 m.p.h zone, according to reports Tuesday in the 
Boston Herald and the Boston Globe. He was not charged with speeding, but 
subsequently failed a sobriety test and refused a blood test, the reports said. 
</P>
<P>
Francis was also charged with failing to wear a helmet, riding an unregistered 
vehicle, failing to have proof of insurance, riding with an expired California 
driver's license and carrying a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
Francis is to appear in court in Reno at a date to be announced.

U.S. SOCCER TEAM KNOWS NOT WHERE IT'S HEADED

The United States' World Cup soccer qualifying game against El Salvador that 
was scheduled for Sunday has been postponed indefinitely, a spokesman for the 
Federation of International Football Assn. said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Guido Tognoni said from FIFA headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland, that the game 
might be played on July 23 in either Tegucigalpa, Honduras, or Canada but that 
neither the date nor the site will be determined until negotiations are 
completed among the United States, El Salvador, FIFA and the potential host 
city. 
</P>
<P>
The game was originally scheduled for San Salvador, El Salvador's capital, but 
FIFA ruled last week that no games could be held in El Salvador for at least 
one month because of a fan disturbance in a June 25 game. 
</P>
<P>
El Salvador requested that the game be moved to Los Angeles, where there is a 
large Salvadoran population. But two other countries in the five-team 
qualifying tournament, Costa Rica and Guatemala, objected because they felt it 
would give the United States the advantage of having an additional home game. 
</P>
<P>
Tognoni said FIFA failed in efforts to persuade Costa Rica and Guatemala to 
give their approval so that the game could be played Sunday. He said the only 
stadium prepared on such short notice was the Coliseum, where tickets have been 
on sale since Monday. Keith Walker, a U.S. Soccer Federation official, said 
Saturday that he was 99.99% sure the game would be in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing we know for sure now is that the game will not be played in the 
United States," Tognoni said. 
</P>
<P>
There is, however, a possibilty that the game will be played in San Salvador, 
he said. FIFA officials will meet July 25 to decide how much longer the 
suspension in El Salvador should last. If the suspension is lifted before the 
United States faces El Salvador, the game probably would be rescheduled for San 
Salvador.

LATE ADDITION OF UNTER A PLUS FOR PANORAMA CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Elling 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scott Smith was chatting with two of his Panorama City players as the season 
opener neared when he asked Dave Garcia and Shane Wight of L. A. Baptist High 
if there were other players from the school who might be interested in, and 
capable of, joining them on the team. 
</P>
<P>
At first, nobody came to mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Then they both started chuckling under their breath," Smith said. "They said 
Dave Unter might be able to help out some." 
</P>
<P>
Might? It didn't take long for Unter to move from afterthought to forefront. 
Unter, a right-hander, has shouldered much of the pitching load for Panorama 
City (11-4), the surprise team of District 20. Unter is 4-0 with a save and has 
allowed only seven earned runs in 35 innings. 
</P>
<P>
And, at 6-foot-5, it's difficult to get one over Unter. 
</P>
<P>
"He's built more like a basketball player than a pitcher," said Smith, who 
should know because he is the basketball coach at St. Genevieve High. "He 
doesn't throw real hard, but he knows how to pitch." 
</P>
<P>
Unter's best outing was June 25 when he threw a two-hitter in a 5-0 win over 
Woodland Hills East, which entered the game in first place in the Western 
Division. Last season at L. A. Baptist, Unter was 8-2 with an earned-run 
average of 2.06. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the last kid we added to the roster," Smith said. "Now I'm glad I asked 
those guys that question." 
</P>
<P>
At least they'll be tan: When Woodland Hills East lost Brett Reisner and Jason 
Shapiro last Wednesday in an outfield collision, it left the team on the ropes 
in terms of personnel. Sunday, nine players showed up for East in a 12-0 loss 
to Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Shapiro broke his nose and loosened several teeth in the mishap and it took 
seven stitches to close a gash in Reisner's right eyelid. The team is now so 
short on players that Reisner has continued to play, even though his eye keeps 
swelling shut during games, Coach Matt Borzello said. 
</P>
<P>
Borzello concedes that any more closed eyes might spell disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"If we have a guy oversleep, we're in big trouble," Borzello said. 
</P>
<P>
Injuries are somewhat expected, but East also has been KOd by, of all things, 
summer vacation. Starting pitcher Chris Brown is in Italy, catcher Adam Zutler 
and infielder Mike Kimelman are on a Club Med trip, and Shapiro is also 
vacationing out of town, Borzello said. 
</P>
<P>
Just two weeks ago, West (8-6) was leading District 20's Western Division; the 
team has since lost five in a row. It's almost enough to make Borzello sprint 
for the border too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to believe this team was 8-1," Borzello said. "We're just going to 
try to hang on until we get some players back. Maybe we can make a run and get 
back in it." 
</P>
<P>
Next time, you can walk: With five games left in the regular season, time is 
running out on Woodland Hills West right-hander Lance Gibson's quest to win 20 
games in his Legion career. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson is 18-3 in his three seasons with West, and if he misses out, he 
probably will remember his first loss of 1989 more than any of the others. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson (5-1) was dealt his first loss this season on Sunday when he was bested 
by Encino-Crespi right-hander Dan Carroll, who struck out 10 in a 6-3 win. Last 
season, Carroll and Gibson, who both live in Woodland Hills, were teammates at 
College of the Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
"They used to drive to school together," said West Coach Gary Gibson, Lance's 
father. "They're pretty good friends." 
</P>
<P>
If Gibson reaches the 20-win plateau, he would become only the second player in 
the past decade of District 20 play to achieve the feat. According to District 
Commissioner Mel Swerdling, Jeff Britt of North Hollywood -- a right-hander who 
later pitched at UCLA -- won 20 games over three seasons, starting in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Lumber and leather: The Woodland Hills West infield of Ryan McGuire at first, 
Paul Geller at second, Rick Banuelos at shortstop and Del Marine at third has 
made only five errors in 17 games. 
</P>
<P>
The foursome isn't bad with the stick, either, batting a collective .461 (89 
for 193) with 67 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Add lumber: Westlake-Agoura, which is 19-1-2 after winning the Gene Waid 
Memorial tournament with a 7-6 victory over Camarillo at Camarillo High on 
Monday, is batting .375 and averaging 10.5 runs a game. 
</P>
<P>
Westlake-Agoura (9-0 in District 16 play) has won 12 in a row and is unbeaten 
in 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
In what should be a battle of teams with the best records and hitting in 
Districts 16 and 20, respectively, Westlake-Agoura will play host to Woodland 
Hills West on July 11 at Westlake High. 
</P>
<P>
Late starters: Third baseman Keyaan Cook hit nine home runs and batted .500 as 
a junior at Montclair Prep last season, his third season as a starter for the 
Mounties. Last week, Cook was named to the all-state Small Schools team by 
Cal-Hi Sports. 
</P>
<P>
But because of conflicts with work, Cook has been able to play only three games 
for the Reseda Legion team. But when he's there, he has made an impact. 
</P>
<P>
Cook drove in the winning run in Sunday's 4-3 victory over Palmdale with a 
two-out single in the 10th inning. Overall, Cook is seven for 13, but he has 
yet to hit a home run. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep telling him to take a good look around at the Reseda field," Reseda 
Coach Frank DesEnfants said. "It's made for him. If he plays more often, he 
might be hitting them out all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Add Reseda: Reseda's June 14 game against Woodland Hills West that was called 
after 6 1/3 innings after the sprinklers came on at El Camino Real High will be 
resumed at 11 a.m. Saturday at Reseda with West leading, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
The regularly scheduled game between the Western Division rivals will follow. 
West (14-3) leads the division and Reseda (10-4) is second. 
</P>
<P>
Unsafe at home, too: Woodland Hills West catcher Bobby Kim was ejected by the 
base umpire after arguing a call at second base in Saturday's 10-9 win over 
Newhall-Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
A day later, while playing catcher, he was tossed by the plate umpire after 
arguing about the strike zone in a 6-3 loss to Encino-Crespi.

MARSH RACES OUT TO EARLY LEAD, WINS CORONADO HALF-MARATHON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sleepy-eyed Jerry Marsh wasn't really thinking about winning his second 
Coronado half-marathon at 6:30 a.m. Tuesday. He thought staying close to the 
leaders might be difficult enough to accomplish in weather he described as "too 
hot." 
</P>
<P>
But after surveying the field, Marsh realized early that he might have to 
re-evaluate his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a stellar field," said Marsh, comparing the competition to other 
years when the half-marathon has been used as training for the Olympic Trials. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh, a former San Diegan who now lives in Los Angeles, set his own pace and 
cruised to a 10-second victory over runner-up Marshall Varano of San Diego in 
the 16th Coronado half-marathon. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody went out and took me out early and when I saw the field, it helped my 
confidence," said Marsh, 25, who has been running the July 4 half-marathon 
since he was 12. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Cash of Denver won the women's race in 1 hour 24 minutes 12 seconds and 
Dan Larson was first among wheelchair participants in 1:10:52. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh's time of 1:10:50 was more than three minutes slower than the winning 
time last year and six seconds slower than the 1:04 he ran in 1987 when he won 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't do a 1:04 today," he said. "What I did was what I was worth. I 
think the heat had a lot to do with that." 
</P>
<P>
The distance may have played a part too. Marsh and four other runners ran an 
extra 200 to 400 meters because they were misdirected while running on the 
naval base. 
</P>
<P>
Varano, whose previous best was an 11th-place finish in '87, also said he had 
no designs on winning the race, but suddenly found himself close to the 
front-runners because of a slower-than-usual pace. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days, I couldn't have been anywhere close to up there," said 
Varano, 25. "This time I went out easy and stayed within range. You get down 
when you don't see anybody in front of you. But that didn't happen today." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Flynn finished nine seconds behind Varano in third place. 
</P>
<P>
And while the blazing sun and humidity may have bothered many of the runners, 
Cash seemed to be unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
"I never felt like I was working very hard," said Cash, a veteran of hilly 
Colorado half-marathons and 10Ks. "If you come down from the altitude, it makes 
it a lot easier." Cash said her victory was special for a couple of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here for a reunion and I didn't know what to expect from the competition 
down here," she said. "It was nice because I turn 40 in two weeks and winning a 
race on the 4th of July is kind of special." 
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 competed in the half-marathon.

MCCORMACK RUNS OFF WITH FIRST PLACE IN THE SCRIPPS RANCH 10K FOR THIRD TIME

To the uninitiated, it may have seemed more than a little out of place. Here it 
was barely past 7:30 a.m. on the Fourth of July -- a day to sleep in for many 
-- and already runners were crossing the finish line of the Scripps Ranch 10K. 
</P>
<P>
Out of place? No. Runners will tell you that early-morning jaunts allow them to 
beat the sun's most vicious rays. 
</P>
<P>
For the 11th consecutive year, Scripps Ranch celebrated the Fourth with a 10K. 
For the third time, the winner was Steve McCormack. 
</P>
<P>
McCormack finished in a slow 30 minutes 34 seconds. It was slow only because in 
1985, McCormack entered the event for the first time and set a race record at 
30:31. But that mark only lasted two years. In 1987, McCormack, who had been 
injured and could not run in 1986, shattered his old record with a 29:48 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
"In '87, I was training for a marathon," McCormack explained, "so I was really 
pulling for a good time." 
</P>
<P>
This year there was no marathon to train for, but what really slowed McCormack 
was a right hamstring that he strained last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even know why I ran," he said of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
He should have been asking himself why he won. Strained hamstring and all, 
McCormack took the lead around the two-mile mark and cruised from there. He and 
fellow Jamul Toad club member Juan Naranjo had set the pace early on, but 
Naranjo simply could not maintain stride with McCormack the entire way. 
</P>
<P>
"We got out early and pushed ourselves," Naranjo said. "Right around two miles, 
we were together and he just took off." 
</P>
<P>
Naranjo, last year's winner at 30:43, finished second at 31:20, ahead of John 
Rice (31:26), Martin Padget (32:09), and Michael Batis (32:14). 
</P>
<P>
Martha Merz of San Diego was the first woman to cross the line at 36:38, an 
improvement over her seventh-place finish of a year ago, but not enough to 
satisfy Merz. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to break 36 minutes," she said. "That's my big goal. I thought I 
could do it today, but it just wasn't my day." 
</P>
<P>
Merz finished ahead of Jeanine Daley (37:37), Madeline Ramirez (37:58), Laureen 
Mahoney (38:35), and Lita Lux (38:59). 
</P>
<P>
Still, Merz's first-place time was well off the race record of Pat Puntous, who 
clocked a 34:41 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the runners cited weather conditions for the lagging times. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually at 7 a.m., it's cool and sometimes a little foggy," Merz said. "But 
today it was just hot."

Randall Dale Adams, who was freed from prison after his guilt in slaying a 
police officer was questioned in the movie "The Thin Blue Line," is suing the 
film's producer to regain the rights to his life story. The lawsuit, filed in 
state district court in Houston, alleges that Errol Morris of Massachusetts 
lost the rights last December by failing to exercise an option to extend a 
two-year agreement. Morris purchased exclusive rights for $10 in December 1986 
and later produced "The Thin Blue Line," which was instrumental in getting the 
Adams case re-heard in Texas courts. Adams, 40, served 12 years in prison 
before being released last March after an appeals court ruled he was entitled 
to a new trial for the 1977 murder of Dallas police officer Robert Wood. "The 
Thin Blue Line" pointed to another man who in a taped interview with Morris all 
but confessed to killing Woods. Randy Schaffer, a Houston lawyer who led the 
fight for Adams' release, said Adams wants a declaration he owns the rights so 
he can pursue book and movie offers estimated "in the neighborhood of six 
figures." Schaffer said Morris has claimed he did exercise the option and has 
resold the rights to Miramax Production Co., also a defendant in the lawsuit. 
Morris said he is "hurt and upset" by the lawsuit. "I worked very, very hard 
for a number of years to see that justice was done in this case." He said he is 
still paying off debts from "The Thin Blue Line" because profits were "nil." 
Morris said that Schaffer was present and did not object when Adams originally 
signed a release. "The simple thing is that when I met Randall Adams nobody 
cared about the case," Morris said. Adams, who returned to his home in Ohio 
after his release, was not available for comment. ALEENE MacMINN

Rap singer Tone Loc, whose "Wild Thing" single hit the Top 10, has been 
arrested in Miami Beach for making "very hostile and belligerent" remarks to a 
police officer. The Los Angeles rapper, whose real name is Tony Terrell Smith, 
was charged with misdemeanor counts of disorderly intoxication and resisting 
arrest without violence. Loc, 23, was booked at the Dade County Jail and 
released on his promise to appear for arraignment at a later date. Loc was 
lying on the beach with a woman when the arrest was made at 4:58 a.m. The beach 
is closed to the public after midnight. The police report said he had bloodshot 
eyes, slurred speech and a strong odor of alcohol on him. Loc's hit album 
"Loc-ed After Dark" has been among the Top 20 LPs for much of the year. ALEENE

JAZZ NOTES: KPFK SPOTLIGHTS TENOR SAX GIANT HAWKINS; ACCLAIMED GUITARIST 
FRISELL MAKES L.A. DEBUT

HAWKINS RADIO SPECIAL: Tenor saxophone giant Coleman Hawkins will be 
spotlighted in a multi-part series produced by disc jockey Jay Green and airing 
Thurdays, noon-2 p.m., through August on KPFK-FM (90.7). In addition to music 
featuring Hawkins, who died in 1969, the continuing program features interviews 
with musicians and critics, among them the late, great saxman Eddie (Lockjaw) 
Davis, pianist Horace Silver and jazz critic Leonard Feather. Green plans to 
begin the series Thursday with an out-of-print interview that was conducted 
with Hawkins in the '50s and was released on Riverside Records. Information: 
(818) 985-2711.

ECLECTIC GUITARIST: Since the critically acclaimed contemporary guitarist Bill 
Frisell names the likes of Charles Ives, Prince, Jimi Hendrix, Wes Montgomery 
and Sonny Rollins as influences, it's not surprising that his music ranges from 
start-and-stop-on-a-dime thrash rock and rhapsodic tangos to Ornette 
Coleman-esque blues and plain hillbilly ditties. It also follows that Frisell, 
whose band makes its Los Angeles debut Sunday at At My Place in Santa Monica, 
won't pigeon-hole himself when asked to describe his style. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't. I mean not at this point," he said from his home in Hoboken, N.J. 
"There were times when it was easy to say . . . I was copying a certain person, 
like when I was into being Jim Hall, but lately it's just a combination of so 
many things. I try not to shut out anything." 
</P>
<P>
Frisell's 4-year-old band -- Hank Roberts on cello, Kermit Driscoll on electric 
bass and Joey Baron on drums -- is featured on his latest release, "Before We 
Were Born" (Elektra/Musician). It makes an ideal ensemble, he said, though not 
one that came together overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"It took me a long time, years, thinking about a band," he said. "I wanted 
something that was a little bit different and I needed to find people that 
could go in a lot of directions. I think I chose these people more for their 
personalities than their instruments." 
</P>
<P>
This spring, the 38-year-old guitarist took his band on a six-week tour through 
Europe and while he said it was a grueling experience -- "It seemed like we 
were always getting up at 6 a.m. to catch a train" -- it also was immensely 
rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so exciting for me because everyday the music got better," he said. "We 
hadn't played that much, maybe a gig every few months. It's been hard to get 
momentum, so this tour was very encouraging. We needed to play." 
</P>
<P>
Though Frisell has appeared on 50 LPs in his 11 years as a pro, teaming up with 
drummer Paul Motian, altoist John Zorn and keyboardist Lyle Mays, he said he 
intends to collaborate less in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"While I thrive on playing with other people's bands, now it feels like the 
time to stand up by myself and see what I can do with all this information I've 
been picking from others, see if I can make it into something of my own." 
</P>
<P>
SCREEN SIGNING: Bay Area-based jazz singer Scotty Wright, who appears tonight 
and Thursday at the Vine Street Bar &amp; Grill, recently made his screen debut 
as a saloon ragtime pianist-singer in "Bad Jim," a Clyde 
Ware-directed-and-written Western starring James Brolin, Richard Roundtree and 
John Clark Gable that is slated for a fall release from 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
Ware liked Wright's performance enough that he's also signed the singer to play 
the lead role in "Bojangles: The Bill Robinson Story." The film, based on the 
life of the famed tap dancer, will be produced by Joseph Wouk and 
directed-written by Ware. "I'll have to dust my dancing shoes off for that 
one," said Wright, whose debut LP is "Too Much Fun." 
</P>
<P>
****"Looking In Looking Out" (Nine Winds) from reed artist Kim Richmond's Los 
Angeles-based Ensemble successfully stretches across many musical bounderies. 
The leader's cabernet-colored alto sound shimmers on "Trains," a nod to '60s 
modality, and "I Thought About You," a straight-forward, blushing ballad. 
Richmond's wind synthesizer is backed by drum thunder from Billy Mintz on the 
thickly-orchestrated "Franz," while "Nardis" and "Solar" exhibit unfettered 
blowing from saxman John Gross and trombonist Mike Fahn, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Records are rated from one to five stars.

Hurray for the Red, White and Blue. A rare white tiger owned by illusionists 
Siegfried and Roy has given birth to three cubs in Osaka, Japan, where the 
entertainers are appearing. The tigress, Sitarra, has mothered 12 of the 17 
white tigers born into the Siegfried and Roy collection, the largest privately 
owned collection of white tigers in the world. The new additions, born on the 
eve of the Fourth of July, will be named Red, White and Blue in honor of 
Independence Day. The German-born illusionists, Siegfried Fischbacher and Roy 
Horn, became American citizens last October shortly before opening a six-month 
engagement in Japan. ALEENE MacMINN

"Weekend at Bernie's" (citywide) is a one-joke comedy as fragile as a soap 
bubble. It never self-destructs, but because it threatens to at every turn, it 
unleashes so many laughs it could just end up a summer sleeper. Writer Robert 
Klane, who has "Where's Momma?" among his credits, has taken an amusing 
premise, and director Ted Kotcheff and his young stars Andrew McCarthy and 
Jonathan Silverman run with it. 
</P>
<P>
McCarthy's laid-back Larry and Parker's uptight Richard are decidedly junior 
executives at a Manhattan insurance company. So zealous is Richard that even on 
the hottest Saturday of the year he is reading computer printouts, when he 
discovers that $2 million has been paid out to a man already dead. Wow! He and 
Larry believe that this bit of information is sure to make their careers. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, the top guy Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser), slick woman-chaser and 
coke-sniffer, is impressed with the detective work -- enough to invite the guys 
out for Labor Day weekend at his place in the Hamptons. It never occurs to them 
that maybe Richard wasn't supposed to have been such a zealous investigator. 
But it's Bernie who promptly winds up a corpse. 
</P>
<P>
Klane ingeniously comes up with all sorts of happenings to keep Larry and 
Richard from contacting the police, and they soon have good reason to believe 
that it's imperative that everyone believe Bernie is still alive. (It's not all 
that hard, for apparently Bernie's pals are used to seeing him zonked out.) 
</P>
<P>
No, "Weekend at Bernie's" isn't the sly, darkly humorous "wandering corpse" 
picture that Hitchcock's "The Trouble With Harry" is. It can't in fact be 
accused of possessing so much as a shred of subtlety, but as a broad farce it's 
not only cleverly sustained but frequently hilarious. What's more, a weekend 
among the rich, the jaded and the corrupt is just the right cup of tea for an 
acid social satirist such as Kotcheff (who casts himself in an amusing cameo as 
Richard's father). 
</P>
<P>
Silverman, who starred in the film of "Brighton Beach Memoirs," and McCarthy 
are deft and likable, but they're upstaged by Kiser. The Broadway and TV 
veteran may be funny as a decadent crook, but he is outright hilarious as the 
corpse who just never seems to stay put. Little more than seeming 
understandably perplexed by the frantic Richard's behavior is required of 
Catherine Mary Stewart, but she has a warm and lovely presence. Don Calfa and 
Catherine Parks get fresh laughs from those familiar gangster types, the 
heartless hit man and the sexpot mistress. 
</P>
<P>
Production designer Peter Jamison's setting adds much to the humor, especially 
Bernie's high-tech beach house, big enough for a small air terminal, luxe 
enough for Gordon Gekko. (More detailed is Richard's parents' perfect echt-'50s 
apartment.) As a light summer refreshment "Weekend at Bernie's" (rated an 
appropriate PG-13) hits the spot.

COLLEGE-LEVEL NEO-TOGA ROCK

The animals were in the house at Club Lingerie, as two leaders from the latest 
fraternity of college-level goofball bands played their neo-toga rock. 
</P>
<P>
Double D Nose might perceive itself as a shotgun wedding between Metallica, 
James Brown and the Beastie Boys, but it's more like the Blues Brothers from 
Hell. Talk about your unlikely frontmen: 90-pound weakling Daniel Weizman 
(a.k.a local underground rock critic Shredder) snarled and screamed and grabbed 
his crotch, playing the hyperactive foil to Josh Schreiber (son of comedian 
Avery Schreiber), a Yeti-like apparition in bad platforms and old Cheap Trick 
tour jacket. 
</P>
<P>
Pledging allegiance to their special brand of funk and rapping about the 
pleasures of preschool Monday night, this bizarre duo managed to get by on 
sheer panache and the vise-tight backing of a seven-piece band complete with 
snappy horn section, bodacious female singers and a trio of long-haired rock 
dudes. Double D Nose is an animated cartoon, more silly putty than def jam, and 
a perverse assault on preconceived notions of how rock/rap/funk performers are 
supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
Dread Zeppelin manages to milk a whole set out of a single concept: a bad fat 
Elvis imitator fronting a band playing reggae versions of Led Zeppelin songs. 
It's initially a big hoot that becomes numbingly predictable -- you just know 
this group will do "Stairway to Heaven" for an encore. And they do. All that 
was missing was Jaye P. Morgan striking the gong. The sextet has already 
developed a rabid following, though, which is more culturally ironic than 
anything in Dread Zeppelin's one-joke pastiche.CRAIG LEE

Brazil, worried about dwindling cash reserves, missed an $812-million interest 
payment on its $112-billion foreign debt, but the government denied it plans to 
declare a new moratorium. Brazil owes about $9 billion to creditors in the 
so-called Paris Club of 10 top industrialized nations. A Finance Ministry 
spokeswoman said the government had postponed a payment for one week because of 
"operative problems." The delay in current payments comes as the central bank, 
Brazil's equivalent of the U.S. Federal Reserve, is attempting to stem the 
outflow of money from the country and keep currency reserves from falling below 
a critical level.

The California State University system will need four to six new campuses -- 
costing between $2.5 billion and $3 billion -- over the next 16 years, or 
thousands of eligible students will be turned away, state higher education 
officials said. "If the state can't come up with the funding, if there's a 
shortage of either faculty or facilities, a lot of students simply won't get 
in," said Frank Jewett, planning director for the state university system. 
Officials predict that enrollment will grow by 186,000 students in the next 15 
years, to 541,300.

The body of Berkeley activist Carlos A. Davila, who worked with senior citizens 
trying to obtain health care, has been found at the foot of a Marin County 
cliff, shot once in the head. Davila's family and co-workers were told of the 
identification as they gathered for a fund-raiser to raise money to search for 
Davila. The 42-year-old man had been missing since May 18. Officials said the 
partially decomposed and fully clothed body was found June 16. The identity was 
confirmed later by comparison of dental records. Magdalena Davila, an organizer 
of the fund-raiser and sister of the dead man, said proceeds now will be used 
to investigate her brother's death. A native Guatemalan, Davila had lived in 
the San Francisco Bay Area for 25 years.

The New York man accused of being the subway vigilante who gunned down three 
youths he suspected of mugging him asserted his innocence, calling his arrest a 
case of mistaken identity. Clemente Jackson, 21, has consistently denied he was 
the gunman who called out "Remember me?" before shooting three youths he 
believed had mugged him the day before at the same Brooklyn subway station. 
Speaking at a Manhattan news conference the day after he was freed on $2,500 
bail, Jackson described his ordeal as a "nightmare," and asserted police had 
arrested the wrong man June 22. Justice Michael Pesce reduced Jackson's bail 
from $50,000 after five witnesses testified that the suspect was on Long Island 
the night of the shooting, said Nancy Young, a spokeswoman for the Brooklyn 
district attorney's office.

Israeli troops arrested 200 Palestinian activists in the occupied West Bank in 
one of the largest sweeps of the 18-month uprising, military sources said. 
Those arrested are suspected of belonging to the popular committees that 
organize and direct the rebellion against Israeli rule. The sweep took place on 
the eve of a key vote in Prime Minster Yitzhak Shamir's Likud Party on his plan 
to let Palestinians in the occupied territories choose negotiators to peace 
talks with Israel. In the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip, meanwhile, thousands of 
workers observed a general strike by staying away from their jobs in Israel to 
protest the issuance of new identity cards required for entry to Israel.

A Richmond boy jumped to his death from a log flume ride at Great America 
amusement park in Santa Clara, witnesses said. Michael Dorsey, 9, who was with 
a church group from Oakland, got off a "Logger's Run" boat as it approached a 
lift to the second flume, the witnesses said. The ride, which had no 
restraining device in its boats, was closed until investigation of the death is 
completed, park officials said. It was the second fatality at the amusement 
park since it opened 13 years ago.

Israel has ordered its soldiers in the occupied Gaza Strip to shoot any masked 
Arabs attempting to flee whether or not they have sought to attack soldiers, 
political sources said in Jerusalem. They said army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan 
Shomron disclosed the order to members of Parliament's Foreign Affairs and 
Defense Committee. Shomron said that if the new rules prove a success in the 
Gaza Strip, they could be extended to the occupied West Bank, the sources said. 
Palestinian youths who hurl stones at Israeli troops in the territories and 
enforce orders of the Arab uprising's leadership swathe their faces in 
checkered headdresses to hamper identification by security forces.

The British government refused to extend blasphemy laws for Muslims who want to 
bring author Salman Rushdie to trial for allegedly blaspheming Islam. Home 
Office Minister John Patten told leading British Muslims that extending the 
laws could damage relations between different religions. But the Muslim leaders 
vowed to continue their campaign to bring Rushdie to court. Demonstrations in 
Britain followed the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's denunciation of Rushdie's 
novel, "The Satanic Verses," in February.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GIRL, 13, FATALLY STABBED BY INTRUDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 13-year-old girl was stabbed by an intruder at her South Gate home early 
Tuesday and died at a hospital, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was stabbed at her home on Bryson Avenue about 3:30 a.m. while she was 
alone in a family room where she, her parents and three brothers had been 
watching television earlier in the evening, Sgt. Russ Galbreath said. 
</P>
<P>
"Family members heard her scream," he said. Her mother, coming to her aid, saw 
a man in a white T-shirt flee the family room through an open sliding glass 
door, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl had been stabbed in the left side of her chest with one of the 
family's kitchen knives, Galbreath said. The intruder apparently entered the 
house through a bedroom window. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was taken to St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood, where she died at 
4:45 a.m., he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't really know what the motive was," Galbreath said. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of the girl, who had graduated from South Gate Junior High School 
and had spent her first day at South Gate High School on Monday, was withheld 
by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests had been made.

LOS ANGELES STREET NAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Researcher Cecilia Rasmussen 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The names of many Los Angeles streets have changed repeatedly over the years, 
reflecting the city's transformation from a tiny Mexican colonial town to a 
booming metropolis. Some streets, predictably, honor war heroes and explorers. 
But others have been named for trees, actors, land developers and -- in one 
case -- the proximity of a bullfighting ring. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, it is not easy to change the name of a street. You must submit 
petitions signed by the majority of landowners along the route to the Land 
Development and Mapping Division of the Bureau of Engineering. After other 
residents get a chance to object, a name-change ordinance is drafted and sent 
to the local City Council member, the council's Public Works Committee and, 
finally, the full council for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 People living along private thoroughfares may have to pay up to $1,000 to 
alter street signs. There is no charge, however, with a public street. It cost 
the city about $70,000 for new signs when Santa Barbara Avenue became Martin 
Luther King Jr. Boulevard in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 At last count there were 953 private and 8,845 public streets in Los Angeles. 
Since the mid-1930s, ordinances have required that the ones running north-south 
be called avenues and those running east-west be called streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Listed below are the current names of some of the city's streets, the dates 
they were dedicated and some of their history. 
</P>
<P>
Aliso Street: 1854 When early settlers arrived at the Los Angeles River (El Rio 
de Nuestra Senora de Los Angeles de Porcinucula) by way of Mission Road, they 
picked as a nearby gathering point a huge sycamore that gave them shelter and 
became a landmark, "El Aliso." That Spanish word for sycamore was later used to 
name the road carved out near the river, which then was not a concrete channel. 
</P>
<P>
Alpine Street: 1887 Before it was named for one of California's 58 counties, it 
had been known as the Street of the Virgins, a place where the young ladies of 
the pueblo strolled with their duenas (chaperones) past admiring caballeros 
(gentlemen). 
</P>
<P>
Alvarado Street: 1855 Named after Gov. Juan Bautista Alvarado, who in 1836 
became the first governor to promote public education. 
</P>
<P>
Arcadia Street: 1872 Arcadia Bandini, born in 1823, was the daughter of 
prominent ranchero Juan Bandini. She came to be regarded as one of the most 
beautiful belles of Los Angeles and was just 14 when she married 40-year-old 
Abel Stearns, who had come west from Massachusetts and acquired Southern 
California's largest land-cattle empire. Stearns built a home for his bride one 
block south of the Plaza -- the community's central gathering area -- and the 
house, called El Palacio, became the social hot spot. In 1858, Stearns 
constructed a two-story business block on Los Angeles Street nearby and called 
it Arcadia Block. The street was officially dedicated one year after Stearns' 
death in 1871. 
</P>
<P>
Astronaut Ellison S. Onizuka Street: 1988 Running diagonally from 1st Street to 
the corner of 2nd and San Pedro streets in Little Tokyo, it was renamed from 
Weller Street last year to honor the Japanese-American astronaut killed in the 
1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger. A century ago, it was used as a 
shortcut by stagecoaches carrying passengers from San Pedro to the Bella Union 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Beverly Boulevard: 1921 Beverly Farms, Mass. 25 miles north of Boston (Farms 
has since been dropped from its name) was where President William Howard Taft 
vacationed in 1900. Burton Green, founder of Beverly Hills, decided that a good 
way to lure people to his city would be to name it after the resort of 
Presidents. In 1906 Green had a street named after himself -- Burton Way. 
</P>
<P>
Broadway: 1890 Part of it was first called Calle Fortin -- Fort Street -- 
because it passed through the hilltop Ft. Moore. Another section was known as 
Eternity Street, because it led to a cemetery; Downey Avenue, after Gov. John 
G. Downey, and Buena Vista Street, whose "good view," as legend has it, was the 
view from the hillside of the women's bathing pools (where the senoritas wore 
bathing dresses). City officials eventually decided to rename Fort Street 
because the area's many German citizens had trouble with the pronunciation -- 
it would come out "Fourth Street," causing confusion with a thoroughfare by 
that name. By 1910, all sections were dedicated under the one name, Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Crenshaw Boulevard: 1904 It was informally known as Crenshaw Boulevard as early 
as 1889 after George L. Crenshaw, an importer who earned a reputation as the 
"banana king." 
</P>
<P>
Cahuenga Boulevard: 1887 An Indian settlement in the middle of the pass at the 
lower end of the San Fernando Valley, Cahuenga was the site of the landmark 
Battle of Cahuenga. The Jan. 13, 1847, Treaty of Cahuenga, signed by Gen. 
Andres Pico and Col. John C. Fremont, ended the Mexican-American War in 
California and declared as part of the United States all land west of the Rocky 
Mountains, south of Oregon and north of Mexico. California officially joined 
the Union on April 4, 1850. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler Boulevard: 1926 One of the most prominent thoroughfares in the San 
Fernando Valley, it was named for Harry Chandler, the partner and son-in-law of 
Gen. Harrison Gray Otis of the Los Angeles Times. Chandler became publisher of 
The Times in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Everett Horton Lane: 1968 The Encino road was named for the late 
character actor, who was considered the honorary mayor of the community. After 
a successful film career, Horton's voice became familiar to children as the 
narrator of the Saturday and Sunday morning Bullwinkle cartoon feature 
"Fractured Fairy Tales." 
</P>
<P>
Figueroa Street: 1855 North Figueroa was originally named Pearl Street and 
South Figueroa was called Calle de las Chapules -- the Street of 
</P>
<P>
Grasshoppers -- because pedestrians used to leap about while sour-faced 
policemen whistled and chased the crowds from one corner to the other. From 
1834 to 1845, Gov. Jose Figueroa, who was part Aztec Indian, directed the 
beginning of secularization of the territory, which had been under the control 
of its missions. After the padres lost their power, California experienced its 
first land boom. Eight million acres were acquired by fewer than 800 men, who 
created 500 ranchos. 
</P>
<P>
Gen. Thaddeus Kosciuszko Way: 1978 The downtown route was named after a Polish 
revolutionary war hero who was recognized as a Renaissance man -- a gifted 
painter, architect, composer, scholar and philosopher -- whose scope of 
interests was a match for that of Thomas Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
Gower Avenue: 1893 Named because it ran along the west side of the ranch 
belonging to George T. Gower. California's first films were made on the corner 
of Gower and Sunset Boulevard in 1911. 
</P>
<P>
Grand Avenue: 1887 It originally was known as Calle de la Caritad -- Charity 
Street -- but when the English version of the name became popular, wealthy 
residents petitioned the City Council to change it. The problem was that, 
though early Spaniards interpreted "Charity" to mean "Christian love" -- and 
other streets nearby were named Faith and Hope -- to the prosperous residents 
the suggestion of handouts was too much to take. 
</P>
<P>
Hill Street: 1849 Part of it -- north of the Plaza -- was first called Calle 
del Toro (Bull Street) because it ended at the ring where crowds gathered after 
Sunday Mass to see bullfights and occasional battles pitting a bull against a 
bear. But the ring eventually faded into oblivion and so did the name. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Boulevard: 1910 Named by Horace Henderson Wilcox, who bought 120 
acres in the foothills northwest of Los Angeles during the 1880s and called the 
area Hollywood. Several decades later, a group of businessmen developed a 
housing tract, Hollywoodland, and advertised it with a huge hillside sign, the 
"land" of which was eventually dropped. Another street in Hollywood, Wilcox 
Avenue, is named for the community's founder. 
</P>
<P>
La Brea Avenue: 1869 Named with the Spanish word for tar, which was found in 
nearby pits and used for waterproofing the sod roofs of the adobe houses in the 
Plaza. The street was part of the 4,439-acre Rancho La Brea, which in 1860 was 
purchased by Maj. Henry Hancock for $2.50 an acre. 
</P>
<P>
La Cienega Boulevard: 1923 Cienega is Spanish for marshland. A section of the 
route was in an area that was always damp, and its grass was green throughout 
the year. Don Francisco Avila was given a grant to Rancho Las Cienegas in 1823. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Street: 1854 Before the first official survey of the area in 1849, 
most of this thoroughfare was called Calle Principal (Main Street). Other 
sections were known as Calle de la Zanja (Ditch Street), Calle de Los Vinas 
(Vineyard Street) and -- much to the south -- Calle de los Huertos (Orchard 
Street), which is now San Pedro Street. These formed the principal highway 
running south to the Embarcadero of San Pedro. At its northern end, near the 
Plaza, a 500-foot stretch was known as Calle de Los Negros, which had a 
racially diverse population. It was543780384hanged by a mob after two policemen 
and a policeman's brother were shot trying to break up a fight. The extension 
of Los Angeles Street in 1886 eliminated the alley and today the site adjoins 
the Hollywood Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Los Feliz Boulevard: 1888 Named after Rancho Los Feliz, a Spanish land grant 
issued to Cpl. Jose Vicente Feliz, who led the first non-Indian expedition to 
what became the Pueblo of Los Angeles. Feliz led 11 families here from Sonora, 
Mexico, in 1781. Most of Feliz's land was the Silver Lake area and the higher 
slopes of Griffith Park. Rancho Los Feliz sold in the 1850s for $1 an acre. 
</P>
<P>
Main Street: 1849 The community's first Calle Principal connected the San 
Gabriel Mission with the San Fernando Valley and many established ranchos. One 
section near the Plaza was known as Bath Street after, legend has it, the 
facilities featuring "scarlet women." 
</P>
<P>
Melrose Avenue: 1887 Ranch owner E. A. McCarthy named the route after his 
hometown of Melrose, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Olvera Street: 1858 Among the oldest streets of the city, it was named in honor 
of Agustin Olvera, one of the commissioners who signed the Treaty of Cahuenga. 
Olvera was the first judge of the County of Los Angeles and later was a county 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
Olympic Boulevard: 1929 Named in honor of the upcoming 1932 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Ord Street: 1890 Originally called High Street, this route off the Plaza was 
renamed after Lt. E.O.C. Ord, who conducted the 1849 official survey and drew 
the first map of Los Angeles, all for a fee of $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Owensmouth Avenue: 1917 Running from the base of the foothills, through the 
community of Owensmouth (known today as Canoga Park), it was named in 
commemoration of the water brought over the mountains to the San Fernando 
Valley from the Owens River. The river was named by one of California's 
pathfinders, Maj. John C. Fremont, for a member of one of his expeditions, 
Richard Owen. 
</P>
<P>
Pico Boulevard: 1855 Named after the 14th and last governor of California under 
Mexican rule, Don Pio Pico, whose grandfather and father had come to the area 
with a 1776 expedition. Pio Pico, who was born in 1801 at Mission San Gabriel, 
built the Pico House hotel, the first three-story building in Los Angeles, 
which still stands. 
</P>
<P>
Sepulveda Boulevard: 1925 Named for the family of Don Francisco and Ramona 
Sepulveda, who had 11 children, all of whom inherited parts of their parents' 
property and acquired more land through their marriages. The road was used by 
the Sepulvedas to transport their cattle, which were often attacked by grizzly 
bears. 
</P>
<P>
Slauson Avenue: 1871 Extending from Whittier to West Los Angeles, it was named 
after Jonathan Sayre Slauson, leader of a group that in 1885 bought about 
15,000 acres of rocky land in the San Gabriel Valley, of which about 4,000 
acres were developed into the city of Azusa. Slauson also owned about 29,000 
acres of what would become the city of South Gate, land sold off by his heirs 
in 1910 for $500 an acre. Slauson, who died in 1905, organized the Los Angeles 
County Bank, was a founder and promoter of the Los Angeles &amp; Independence 
Railroad, the first rail connection between Los Angeles and Santa Monica, and 
helped organize the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
Spring Street: 1849 As legend has it, it was named Calle Primavera by Lt. Ord 
to honor his sweetheart in Santa Barbara, Trinidad Ortega, whom he called 
"Primavera," Spanish for "Springtime." He never married Ortega, the 
granddaughter of Jose Francisco Ortega, the Spanish explorer who "discovered" 
San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Sunset Boulevard: 1888 Earlier called Bellevue Street -- and with some small 
sections called Short, Bread and Marchessault streets (after Mayor Damien 
Marchessault) -- it started on U.S. Sen. Cornelius Cole's hill in what is now 
Hollywood, which afforded a fine view of the sunset over the Pacific. By 1937, 
11 streets in Hollywood were named after the Cole family. 
</P>
<P>
Temple Street: 1859 Named after John Temple, who opened the first store in Los 
Angeles. He built a block of shops, lawyers' offices and a saloon at Main and 
Temple streets, where Los Angeles City Hall stands today. 
</P>
<P>
Vignes Street: 1874 Named for Louis Vignes, who arrived in Los Angeles in 1831 
bringing cuttings from France that he used to found a 100-acre vineyard called 
El Aliso, where Union Station now stands. 
</P>
<P>
Winnetka Avenue: 1916 An egg farm owned by Charles Weeks was in the Northwest 
San Fernando Valley during the 1920s and early '30s. Weeks modeled the poultry 
business on one he founded in Winnetka, Ill., before moving to California. 
</P>
<P>
Wilmington Avenue: 1870 Phineas Banning, seeking to improve transportation in 
the area, bought some land near the ocean, which he called New San Pedro. He 
created a channel and built a wharf, warehouse, soap and tallow factory, and a 
blacksmith shop. In 1863, Banning changed the name of the community to 
Wilmington, after his birthplace in Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
Wilshire Boulevard: 1895 Serving as a pathway from the Indian Village Yang Na 
(believed to have been where City Hall is today) to the Pacific Ocean, it 
originally was called Calle de los Indios. In 1895, H. Gaylord Wilshire, a real 
estate investor, subdivided a tract of land just west of downtown near 
MacArthur Park and renamed the street after himself. In 1922, lots on Wilshire 
Boulevard sold for $54,000.

<P>
SCHEDULED LONG BEACH-L.A. FLIGHT CUTS DOWN 17-MILE TRAVEL TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frazzled at the thought of facing the bumper-to-bumper commute down the San 
Diego Freeway? 
</P>
<P>
Find flaws with such ecological alternatives as the car pool or such pricey 
fare as the taxi? 
</P>
<P>
Well, you can always take a plane. Among the 89 far-flung cities listed in a 
new American Airlines ad campaign for summer discount fare destinations from 
Los Angeles International Airport is one just 17 miles away: Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Fact is, it might be cheaper to rent a stretch limousine. 
</P>
<P>
American reservations clerks will tell you that the least-expensive, round-trip 
coach price for the intra-county flight is $85. That's $7 more than the fare to 
San Diego, San Francisco or San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, to qualify, passengers must comply with the same restrictions on 
the Long Beach-to-Los Angeles jaunt as they would taking a 2,475-mile 
transcontinental trip to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Specifically, tickets must be purchased two weeks in advance and travelers from 
Los Angeles must stay overnight in Long Beach at least one Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$134 Price Prevails 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the airline said, the trip costs $134. 
</P>
<P>
Few passengers pay full fare, American officials said, inasmuch as the 
twice-daily flights on the 15- and 19-passenger commuter propjets operated by 
the airline's American Eagle subsidiary are offered primarily as a feeder 
service for travelers making connections with long-distance flights in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
But there are exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
"I recently had someone coming into LAX from a long flight who looked down and 
saw the 405 Freeway was an absolute disaster," said David Michel, a passenger 
service supervisor for American Eagle. "When he landed, he threw his credit 
card down and paid me $67 for a one-way flight to Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Couriers dismayed by heavy freeway traffic also occasionally make use of the 
service, according to American officials. 
</P>
<P>
American is the only major airline that flies between Los Angeles and Long 
Beach. The concise route is not the shortest scheduled by a major commercial 
carrier -- that title goes to United for its once-daily, 11-mile run over the 
bay between San Francisco and Oakland. But Long Beach-Los Angeles is apparently 
the briefest over land, besting a TWA route between Burbank and Long Beach by 
nine air miles. 
</P>
<P>
"The record time from Long Beach to LAX," said Michel, "is 4.5 minutes from 
lift-off to touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday morning, Flight 5313 from Los Angeles revved up right on schedule 
at 11:13 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Compact Compartment 
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine Beechcraft C-99, which felt like a vibrating, airborne 
toothpaste tube, is so small that the four passengers were seated in the same 
compartment as the pilot and first officer. 
</P>
<P>
There was no flight attendant, no food, no beverages and no bathroom aboard. 
"We tell them the movie today is the 405 Freeway," joked pilot John 
Villedrouin. 
</P>
<P>
After an eight-minute wait to leave the ground, the plane headed west toward 
the Pacific, climbing to 5,000 feet and hugging the South Bay coastline before 
veering east past the Palos Verdes Peninsula and Seal Beach and swinging back 
toward Long Beach. Within 17 minutes -- about the time it took for passenger 
Sue Sucher to consume a couple of pages of a paperback -- the plane was back on 
terra firma. 
</P>
<P>
Sucher, headed to Long Beach from Palo Alto for a youth soccer conference, 
thought the flight was fascinating. But she added that the haze of smog that 
hid most of the Los Angeles Basin was mortifying. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a daughter in college in Claremont," she said, "and it's very 
frightening." 
</P>
<P>
After a 20-minute layover, the return flight was airborne only 8 1/2 minutes -- 
two minutes less than the time it took to taxi in to the terminal once the 
plane had landed. 
</P>
<P>
The flight -- north toward Inglewood and then west to LAX -- was also choppier. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a bumpy road," said sweating, Chicago-bound Eddie Acuna of Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Going to Take a Car' 
</P>
<P>
Acuna and his wife, Ophelia, had taken the Long Beach flight to avoid having 
their 18-year-old son drive them to LAX. Next time, Acuna said, "I'm going to 
take a car or a cab." 
</P>
<P>
In May, 224 passengers flew between the two communities on a single scheduled 
late-morning flight in each direction, according to American Airlines spokesman 
Ed Stewart. Those numbers were strong enough, Stewart said, that a second, 
mid-afternoon flight was added last month. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe it or not, there are people who would fly next door if the service 
were offered," Stewart said. "We are starved for planes. If it wasn't used, I 
guarantee it would be canceled in 10 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
Added the Dallas-based spokesman: "I've never been to Los Angeles for an 
extended period but I've heard the freeways are as bad as putting a bullet 
through your head." 
</P>
<P>
Besides their function as connector flights, the Los Angeles-Long Beach flights 
serve several other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Free-trip junkies seeking to pick up quick miles for their frequent-flier plans 
occasionally hop on, since the minimum award American offers for any of its 
flights is 500 miles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frequently Half Empty 
</P>
<P>
American employees also hitch rides, usually for business purposes, on the 
frequently half-empty planes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of pretty to fly at 2,000 feet," noted American Eagle passenger 
service representative Alex Syracopoulos. 
</P>
<P>
Richard M. Valade, a merchandising manager for General Foods in New York, 
recently took the noon hop from Long Beach to Los Angeles to take advantage of 
a cost-cutting scheduling quirk. 
</P>
<P>
Valade would have had to pay $934 for an unrestricted transcontinental round 
trip between New York and Los Angeles because he made last-minute reservations. 
But American was offering a special $318 unrestricted fare from the East Coast 
to Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It was much cheaper to fly from New York to Long Beach than from New York to 
Los Angeles," Valade said.

CONS GOLD OKS $5.5-BILLION BID BY HANSON PLC; 
</P>
<P>
BIGGEST MERGER IN BRITISH HISTORY COMES WEEKS AFTER RIVAL SUITOR IS REJECTED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Less than six weeks after fending off a hostile bid from Minorco, Consolidated 
Gold Fields PLC agreed Tuesday to a $5.5-billion merger, the biggest in British 
history, with industrial conglomerate Hanson PLC. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson, one of the most predatory companies on the British scene, said Cons 
Gold had agreed to be acquired for $24.17 a share, most of it cash. 
</P>
<P>
On June 22, Hanson offered $22.59 a share in cash for Cons Gold, but the mining 
concern turned the bid down as inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's agreement, however, did not come as any surprise. The two companies 
had said they had been in friendly talks since the eve of Hanson's first public 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased that the Cons Gold board has unanimously recommended 
shareholders to accept the new offer," Lord Hanson, chairman of the 
London-based company, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fought Off Minorco 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Hanson said Cons Gold Chairman Rudolph Agnew would join 
Hanson's board as a non-executive director, while an undetermined number of 
Hanson representatives would sit on the board of Cons Gold. 
</P>
<P>
The merger agreement between Hanson and Cons Gold comes less than six weeks 
after Cons Gold fought off a hostile bid from Luxembourg-based Minerals &amp; 
Resources Corp., the overseas investment arm of South African millionaire Harry 
Oppenheimer's gold and diamonds empire. 
</P>
<P>
Although Minorco had won control of a majority of Cons Gold's shares, its 
takeover effort was stymied by a U.S. court ruling that the merger would have 
violated antitrust laws. The suit was filed by New York-based Newmont Mining 
Corp., which is 49%-owned by Cons Gold. 
</P>
<P>
Minorco, whose bid had also aroused opposition from political groups that 
viewed it as an expansion of South African interests abroad, said in late June 
that it would sell its stake to Hanson. 
</P>
<P>
The British company, whose interests range from building materials to food 
retailing, derives about half its $13-billion annual revenue from U.S. 
holdings, including Kidde Inc. in Saddlebrook, N.J., and Kaiser Cement Corp. in 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
In early June, Hanson said it would sell most of its stock in Smith Corona 
Corp. to the public for about $330 million, marking the return of the 
typewriter manufacturer as an independent company. Hanson acquired Smith Corona 
in 1986, when it took over its parent, SCM Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson's British holdings include Imperial Tobacco Group and stakes in such 
companies as Midland Bank. 
</P>
<P>
One of Britain's 10 biggest concerns, Hanson has grown through acquisitions. 
Hanson and his partner Sir Gordon White, the company's chief strategist and 
head of its U.S. operations, tend to buy companies, restore them to 
profitability and sell them again. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said it seemed likely that Hanson would sell off large parts 
of Cons Gold, which has interests in South Africa, as well as in Britain and in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said they believed it would shed Cons Gold's gold-mining 
interests and build up the aggregates -- stone and gravel -- side of the 
business. Ironically, that could allow Minorco to buy up some of the Cons Gold 
interests it had sought in its failed takeover bid. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not immediately clear if Minorco has any such plans. 
</P>
<P>
For several months, industry analysts had expected Hanson to make a takeover 
move. The company has more than $2 billion in cash reserves and $20 billion in 
borrowing lines from banks. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Hanson said the company's per-share offer for Cons Gold 
consists of $22.59 in cash, warrants valued at 95 cents and a special dividend 
worth 63 cents.

DOWN AND DIRTY IN THE MARINA;

<P>
DIVERS SCRUB AND SCRAPE TO KEEP YACHTS SAFE FROM DENIZENS OF THE BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Marko Mavrovich spends most of his working day upside down, immersed in a 
cloudy green saline solution whose exact composition would fascinate a 
toxicologist. On his hands and knees he scrubs and scrapes, fighting the 
resistance of wet suit and water. He breathes slowly -- air is money in this 
business -- and works his tongue to expel the steady trickle of brine that 
sneaks into an inverted scuba mouthpiece. He hopes the propeller looming in the 
murk doesn't suddenly spring to life. 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to the dark underbelly of Marina del Rey, a hidden battleground and 
venue of one of the world's toughest jobs. The teak-and-brass encrusted yachts 
and their wealthy owners may gleam gloriously in the summer sun, but below the 
waterline a voracious community of tiny tubular worms, slimy microbes and 
corrosive electrons is on the offensive. And the essential task of defending 
boating civilization from this onslaught falls to the hardy young men of the 
dive service industry. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a special breed of person who can do this," says Paul Skipper, owner of S 
&amp; K Dive Service and a pioneer of the underwater maintenance business in 
Marina del Rey. "It's always hard to tell if a guy's really got it in his heart 
to work this hard." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Robinson, a former stunt man and owner of Galiongee Mariner Service, said 
his firm once went through more than 70 people in one year. And that's for a 
job that can pay $500 to $800 for a 30- to 35-hour week. "We get these 
ex-Marines and body builders in here saying 'I can do anything,' but they calm 
down after a few days." Californians usually can't handle it, says Robinson. 
Too laid-back. Israeli army veterans are a much better bet. 
</P>
<P>
Mavrovich, who was raised on an island in Yugoslavia and went to merchant 
marine school, is modest about the physical demands of cleaning boat bottoms. 
"It keeps you in shape, but it's not something you can do all your life," he 
says with massive understatement. Scott Gee, a former Navy diver, notes with a 
sardonic grin that "the guys who are used to looking at pretty fish don't last 
long." Salvage work in the Navy, Gee says, was child's play compared to boat 
cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, divers clean off undersea growth, which is as interesting as scrubbing 
floors, only harder. In Marina del Rey, the primary culprits are tube worms, 
tiny organisms that grow in coral-like strands on metal hardware such as 
propellers and on any thinly painted portion of the hull. Don Speaker, owner of 
Yacht Services Co. and perhaps the leading local authority on various aquatic 
adversaries, says they grow 1/16 of an inch per day in the warm summer water. 
Less nefarious algae cling even to well-painted surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
Divers also replace the chunks of zinc that are attached to the hardware of 
boats to prevent corrosion. Because propellers, shafts and rudders are made of 
metal alloys, they corrode by an electrolysis reaction when immersed in salt 
water. When zinc is attached, it corrodes instead of the alloy. Some divers 
also wield drills and saws, driven by compressed air, to install knotmeters and 
exhaust ports and the like. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Independent Contractors 
</P>
<P>
And then there are "recoveries." July 5, like any other day after a holiday, 
brings lots of calls from people who managed to let indispensable items slip 
into the harbor. Keys and glasses are the mainstays of recovery, but the 
veteran divers have seen it all. Moshe Kotlov of Neptune Divers says he's 
recovered a drunk LAPD officer's gun as well as diamond rings, Rolex watches 
and credit cards. Skipper once went down after the entire wardrobe of a man 
who'd had a fight with his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly all divers, including Mavrovich and Gee, are independent contractors who 
work for underwater service companies on a piece-work basis. Typically, the 
companies charge 75 cents to $1.10 per foot, depending on the type of boat, for 
a monthly clean, and the divers collect 40% to 50% of that fee. Divers who have 
the endurance to clean 10 30-foot boats a day can thus do pretty well -- if 
they avoid ear infections and adapt to the strange psychological pressure that 
comes from spending every day underwater. 
</P>
<P>
They can make even more, of course, if they keep the whole fee for themselves. 
And since it takes little more than a regular scuba outfit plus a 40-foot 
air-hose (tanks are left on the dock or in a dingy) to be your own business, 
the competition is ferocious. In Marina del Rey, four big service companies 
have 600 to 1,000 accounts each, but dozens of independent operators also ply 
the waters, offering lower prices and promising better service. 
</P>
<P>
In a business where hands-on management means donning scuba gear, quality 
control is a major problem for the all the companies, especially since most 
customers never really see what they're being billed for. The temptation is 
strong, at the end of a tough day, for a diver to wipe off the film along the 
waterline and call it a clean. Skipper, Robinson and other owners -- who all 
once did the cleaning themselves -- still go under unannounced to check their 
contractors' work. As in any service business, customer satisfaction is 
everything, and boat owners are a fussy lot. 
</P>
<P>
One would expect divers to get some respect, since the they're the first line 
of defense against possible threats to a very valuable investment. Nope. "Most 
of the owners see you as the equivalent of a gas station attendant, there to 
serve," says Kotlov. "But a few, especially the racers, are very 
knowledgeable." 
</P>
<P>
"Race cleans" are in fact the divers dream, as they involve little more than 
dusting off the hull of a well-maintained boat. No rock-like tube worms. No 
menacing engines. On a recent stellar morning in Marina del Rey, as the divers 
from S &amp; K puttered off in their skiffs across the glistening water, it was 
almost possible to think of diving as a fun job. Almost.

JAMES FLANIGAN: A PENNY SAVED IS AN ECONOMY STRENGTHENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anxiety about the U.S. economy is running high. The latest statistics -- the 
government's leading indicators, factory orders, the intentions of corporate 
purchasing agents -- all point to a slowdown in business. 
</P>
<P>
And the mood is anxious in the stock market, which fell sharply last week, 
although prices bounced back a bit on Monday in slow, pre-Fourth of July 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
The worry is about recession. Will the economy only slow down or will it tumble 
into a new recession like that of 1982, with massive layoffs and economic 
suffering? 
</P>
<P>
The answer almost certainly is slowdown. What the economy is really doing is 
not declining into recession, but undergoing a profound shift from the 1980s to 
the 1990s, from a heavy dependence on debt financing to a healthier reliance on 
savings and investment. The transition may be wrenching, but ultimately the 
economy could emerge stronger for the decade ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence for such a hopeful outlook is in statistics on debt and personal 
savings. U.S. companies and consumers are not adding to their debts, notes 
Charles Clough, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch, the securities 
firm. And that is encouraging, even though one reason debt isn't growing is 
that many companies and individuals are already borrowed to the limit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Americans Saving More 
</P>
<P>
The fact is, banks and other lenders are now collecting more in interest each 
year than they are laying out in new loans -- and that's a condition that 
should lead to a fall in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Even more hopeful is the news that Americans are saving more -- 5.7% of their 
disposable income in the first quarter of 1989, compared to 3.7% through all of 
last year. That's the highest level of savings in four years and reflects both 
a slowdown in spending by consumers worried about the economy and an aging baby 
boom population thinking about retirement. 
</P>
<P>
It's a good beginning for a pattern of higher savings, although still below the 
7% to 8% of their income that Americans saved in the 1950s and '60s when the 
economy was truly strong. 
</P>
<P>
It's those savings, many analysts believe, that are generating long-term 
confidence about the U.S. economy and boosting the dollar's value on world 
markets -- despite the prospect of falling interest rates, which normally would 
bring the dollar down. 
</P>
<P>
Change, however, is not painless. When economies shift, some industries suffer. 
As a general rule, those industries that depend on high levels of borrowing 
will do comparatively poorly in the new environment. They include commercial 
real estate, already in the doldrums in many cities, and residential real 
estate, which has slowed even in Southern California. Retail stores and auto 
dealers may be hurt as consumers spend less. 
</P>
<P>
But the payoff will be in a healthier economy in the 1990s, says Peter Rona, 
president of IBJ Schroder Bank &amp; Trust Co., a U.S. joint venture of the 
Industrial Bank of Japan and London's J. Henry Schroder banking company. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could just get the savings rate closer to 8%, we would have balanced 
trade and the need for foreign investment would be reduced," says Rona. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lower Dollar Hurt Industry 
</P>
<P>
It is important that domestic savings be able to finance U.S. industry, he 
explains, because continuing to depend on Japanese investors to buy $50 billion 
to $65 billion a year in U.S. government bonds and other securities is not 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
The money stopped coming once, says Rona, when Japanese buyers fearing a 
decline in the dollar stayed away from U.S. Treasury auctions last fall, and 
could do so again. The American economy weathered the capital shortage at the 
time, but interest rates rose. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the lower dollar that in one sense was helping U.S. industry sell its 
goods on world markets was hurting it in another way by raising interest rates. 
U.S. companies have to borrow at 11%, while Japanese companies borrow at less 
than 5% and West German firms at 6%. 
</P>
<P>
It's probably no accident that, since then, thinking appears to have shifted, 
so that a lower dollar is no longer seen as the key to U.S. competitiveness. 
Rather, there is greater understanding among financial and economic experts 
that, if domestic savings increase, then U.S. industry can enjoy lower costs of 
capital and be competitive with a strong dollar. 
</P>
<P>
"We can come into the 1990s with an economy driven by savings and investment," 
says Merrill Lynch's Clough. He is not alone in that vision. It is shared by 
economists Deborah Allen at California's Claremont Economics Institute and 
Edward Yardeni at Prudential-Bache Securities, who have long anticipated an 
increase in savings among Americans. 
</P>
<P>
If those experts are right, the long-term outlook is bright indeed. The 
immediate prospect is for lower interest rates; that's why bond prices are 
rising at the moment. Then, the next upturn in the economy and in the stock 
market will be led by companies making electrical equipment and other machinery 
for expanding U.S. industry and for export to growing foreign economies. 
Foreign investment will still be welcome in U.S. markets -- perhaps even more 
welcome because, with adequate domestic savings, it won't be so critically 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
That's a comforting vision to be sure, but there are many who see it through 
the present anxiety.

Recession Fears Easing, Study Finds: Inflation will increase this year, mainly 
because of higher costs for food, health care and energy, but fears of a 
recession are subsiding as interest rates fall, according to a study by Pacific 
Gas &amp; Electric Co. "The likelihood of a 'soft landing' -- a slower growth 
economy with moderate inflation -- has improved in recent weeks," said Tapan 
Munroe, chief economist for the utility. The gross national product growth for 
the rest of 1989 is expected to be 2.6%, while 1990's GNP should be 1.2%, the 
forecast said. Inflation will be higher this year, with a consumer price index 
increase of 4.9%, compared to 4.1% in 1988.

British Gold Reserve Tapped: The British government used up 5% of Britain's 
gold and foreign currency reserves last month in its attempt to prevent the 
pound's weakness from turning into a full-scale sterling crisis. Figures 
released by the British Treasury showed that the underlying level of the 
reserves fell by $2.236 billion in June -- the biggest drop ever and an 
indication of the scale of the Bank of England's intervention in the foreign 
exchanges. With inflation already running at above 8%, the government was 
forced to act, since a lower pound leads to more expensive imports and 
eventually higher prices.

Pension Funds Urge Changes at Oil Companies: Directors of two top public 
pension funds, which were successful in forcing recent changes at Exxon Corp., 
are urging six major oil companies to alter their policies dealing with 
environmental, safety and health issues. The message was delivered in joint 
letters to Amoco Corp., Ashland Oil Inc., Pennzoil Co., Tenneco Inc., Amerada 
Hess and Kerr-McGee Corp. California State Controller Gray Davis, one of the 
trustees for the nation's largest public pension fund, and New York City 
Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin urged the companies to add an environmental 
expert to their boards and called for the creation of a public issues 
committee.

SAVINGS ARE KEY TO GLOBAL PROSPERITY, WORLD BANK SAYS

More saving by Americans and others is a key to international prosperity, the 
World Bank said Tuesday in its annual review of economic development. 
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is the largest source of aid for Third World countries, lending 
over $21 billion in the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental problem is a shortage of world saving," said Stanley Fischer, 
one of the bank's vice presidents and its chief economist. 
</P>
<P>
"We focus very much in economics on the U.S. budget deficit, but that's only 
one aspect of the shortage of world saving," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because Americans do not save enough to meet the borrowing needs of both 
government and business, the government has to borrow from the savings of other 
countries to deal with the budget deficit. And government demand for money 
helps keep interest rates high. 
</P>
<P>
Greater savings would make more money available, thereby holding down interest 
rates. Lower interest rates make it easier for business to borrow for the 
expansion that creates more goods and more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Fischer said that countries all over the world need to encourage saving. 
</P>
<P>
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development finds that of 19 
major countries, citizens of Britain, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and 
Sweden saved less by percentage than American households did last year. 
Japanese, West Germans, French, Swiss, Belgians, Spaniards and Italians saved a 
lot more. 
</P>
<P>
Reducing interest rates may be the most important thing that rich countries can 
do for the Third World, said Fischer, who presented the World Bank's 1989 World 
Development Report. 
</P>
<P>
The report challenged a key tenet of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's 
Third World debt strategy. It said developing countries will not be able to 
count on more money from Western lenders even if a reduction in their foreign 
debt makes them more credit-worthy. 
</P>
<P>
"All the evidence points to continued low capital flows to the developing 
countries in the coming decade," the Bank said. "Official flows cannot fully 
offset the sharp reduction in private flows." 
</P>
<P>
The report said a reduction in the Third World's $1.3-trillion debt might 
significantly improve the investment climate and thereby encourage the return 
of flight capital. But it also said debt reduction could lead to a sharp 
decline in new money and possibly even to an increase in net outflows, which 
would depress investment. 
</P>
<P>
"These considerations reinforce the view that continued and powerful structural 
adjustment by the debtor countries remains the most important ingredient in 
dealing with the debt problem," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Millard F. Long, the American who led the team that prepared the 1989 report, 
compared the situation in the Third World to the savings and loan crisis in 
this country. 
</P>
<P>
"We found institution after institution which, we can say, were technically 
insolvent, much as our savings and loans are in the United States," he said.

THE SWEET CHARIOT SWINGS LOW -- A STUDY OF BLACK BURIAL RITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
COLUMBIA, S.C. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Africans who came to America in the dark holds of slave ships carried few 
possessions. But they brought with them traditions no captor could eradicate. 
</P>
<P>
Those traditions included customs associated with proper burials -- "to be put 
away nicely," as it is said here. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those burial practices have been continued to this day by the 
descendants of early black Americans who have lived for generations along the 
Southern Atlantic coast. Archeologist Elaine Nichols, 36, spent nearly two 
years collecting material for her historical portrayal of how blacks in South 
Carolina have mourned their loved ones and paid their last respects from the 
days of slavery to the present. 
</P>
<P>
The result, her moving exhibit titled "The Last Miles of the Way: 
African-American Homegoing Traditions" opened recently in the new South 
Carolina State Museum in this capital city and will continue through December, 
before it is scheduled to begin a nationwide tour. 
</P>
<P>
According to Nichols, who has lived in the Carolinas all her life, in the early 
days along the Atlantic Coast, black burial grounds were almost always near the 
water, the belief being the deceased would be carried back home to Africa, 
"back home to heaven," by the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
"The world of the dead was a watery world, an upside down world under the 
living world," she explained, so "grave decorations would always include 
dishes, plates, cups, saucers, items associated with water." 
</P>
<P>
Some black graves in South Carolina continue to be decorated African-style with 
personal possessions of the deceased, with charms and magical writing to 
placate the spirit of the person buried there, said Nichols, who visited many 
black cemeteries in the course of her research. 
</P>
<P>
Among many blacks in South Carolina, Nichols noted, proper burial is associated 
with protecting both the living and the dead. In that tradition, a person has a 
body, a soul and a spirit. At death, the soul leaves the body to go to the 
world of the hereafter, but the spirit remains close by. Without proper 
precautions, she explained, evil spirits can wander around, haunt and harm 
people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Spirit Stopper 
</P>
<P>
So one old custom, said Nichols, was to make certain the dead person's mouth 
was tightly sealed by tying a piece of cloth under the chin to the top of the 
head to keep the spirit from leaving the body. 
</P>
<P>
Hats, including the flat black hats worn by women, were kept on indoors at 
funerals as a gesture of respect. And the black armbands and crepe hearts still 
worn by mourners on their sleeves in some areas is a tradition traced back to 
the early days. 
</P>
<P>
In another custom still practiced at some South Carolina funerals -- especially 
those held in the coastal area called the Low Country, and on the offshore Sea 
Islands -- babies and small children are handed from one person to another over 
a dead grandparent's body. The hope is that the spirit of the dead relative 
will not bother the child, and that the child will accept mystical powers 
bequeathed by the deceased. 
</P>
<P>
A dramatic photograph of this tradition, shot for National Geographic magazine 
at a 1987 Sea Island funeral, is part of the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
To research such traditions, to authenticate what she already knew and delve 
deeper into the origins, philosophy and practice of burial customs, Nichols 
talked to hundreds of elderly black funeral directors, old black ministers and 
black senior citizens throughout the state to gather information, photographs 
and artifacts. She searched university archives, courthouse records, libraries 
and newspaper files. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Importance of Death 
</P>
<P>
"My intention is to show how blacks have responded to death over the years, to 
explain the importance of death in black culture, to note how many of the old 
customs still persist not only in isolated rural areas but South Carolina 
cities as well," Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
When someone dies, according to the old way -- and occasionally still today -- 
all clocks in the deceased's home are stopped, all mirrors, pictures and 
anything with glass are covered with black cloth or turned to the wall as a 
protection against bad spirits. 
</P>
<P>
Locks were traditionally cut from the deceased's hair, to be made into jewelry 
or wreaths or placed in Bibles belonging to family and friends marking the dead 
person's favorite passage. 
</P>
<P>
And on the evening of the services, a time-honored practice that persists is to 
stay awake and "set up" all night beside the body, praying, singing spirituals, 
recalling pleasant memories of the deceased. Friends and relatives bring cooked 
hams, fried chicken, salads and homemade pies for the all-night vigil. 
</P>
<P>
Among the exhibit's photographs of famous black funerals is one from an 1895 
issue of Harper's Magazine; another, of the 1937 funeral of Daniel Jenkins, 
founder of the century-old Jenkins Orphanage for black children in Charleston. 
It was one of the largest funerals ever held in the historic city. One photo 
shows the Jenkins Orphanage Brass Band, which performed at the services in full 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
Also on display as part of the exhibit, which was funded in part by the South 
Carolina Humanities Council, are examples of the funeral home advertising fans 
presented at church services, which were printed with photographs of the 
departed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Black Undertakers 
</P>
<P>
However, in many areas of South Carolina there were no black undertakers, and 
no embalming until the 1920s and '30s. In those early days, families and 
friends took care of the dead with two services -- one at the burial that took 
place within hours of death, the other on a Sunday soon after, when it was 
possible to gather together as many relatives and friends as possible for a 
memorial service. 
</P>
<P>
Film footage, which is part of the exhibit, shows a traditional "ring shout" at 
a "praise house" funeral on St. Helena Island in the late 1930s. In it, 
families and friends in a circle shout praises to the Lord, clap, sing 
spirituals and perform a special "ring shout" dance -- in which no person 
crosses his or her feet. Not crossing the feet, Nichols said, was considered 
sacred -- as opposed to secular -- dancing. 
</P>
<P>
Ring shouts were brought from West Africa, where they were part of traditional 
tribal burial ceremony. In the Carolinas, the practice became common during 
regular religious meetings at both praise houses and churches. "I have heard 
that ring shouts still occur on rare occasions but have not seen one myself," 
Nichols added. 
</P>
<P>
Praise houses were developed on plantations during slavery, she noted. These 
were special structures where slaves worshiped during the week. On Sundays, 
they would attend churches located some distance from the plantations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Special Note 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit takes special note of the role of black burial societies, which 
flourished in South Carolina and elsewhere. The societies were membership 
organizations that provided emotional and financial support at the time of a 
death in the family. They were as important as churches. The earliest, the 
Brown Fellowship Society, was founded in Charleston in 1790. Others included 
the Sons and Daughters of Jerusalem, Queen Esther's Court, Bright Morning Star 
Society and the African-American Order of the Owls. 
</P>
<P>
Dues per family were as little as 25 cents a month in the 1920s and 1930s. When 
a death occurred, the family would receive a cash payment of $250 to cover 
funeral expenses. Members of the societies wore uniforms, attended meetings. 
Society funds were invested in banks, real estate, businesses, schools and used 
to promote social programs for members. 
</P>
<P>
Another of the displays in the exhibit is a model of the Randolph Cemetery, 
which was founded in Columbia in 1871 by 19 black men and named for South 
Carolina Sen. B. F. Randolph, who was hanged by whites when he attempted to run 
for reelection. Buried in the cemetery are the remains of nine black 
Reconstruction-era representatives and senators. The real cemetery is now in 
ruins, said Nichols, vandalized, with tombstones overturned and overgrown with 
weeds. The model is an artist's conception of what it would look like had it 
been properly maintained. 
</P>
<P>
Her underlying hope, Nichols said, "is that through this exhibit, I will be 
able to show one can find meaning in life by finding meaning in death."

'STING' CASE MAY ALTER STATE TAX FOR ENTERTAINERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
State tax officials say they will meet within the next few weeks to discuss 
ramifications of a court ruling involving actor Paul Newman that has altered 
how state income tax is assessed for entertainment industry figures who work in 
California but don't live here. 
</P>
<P>
The decision -- upheld by the California Supreme Court early last month -- has 
the effect of equating non-resident actors and actresses, musicians, artists 
and other entertainment personnel with professional athletes in terms of how 
state income tax is determined. 
</P>
<P>
In court documents in the case -- which focused on Newman's compensation for 
his starring role in the 1973 film "The Sting" and also involved his wife, 
actress Joanne Woodward -- state officials predicted a near breakdown in 
California's ability to tax nonresidents. 
</P>
<P>
In a court petition in which the California Franchise Tax Board sought to 
persuade first the state Court of Appeal and then the Supreme Court to overturn 
a trial court ruling in Newman's favor, state tax officials contended that the 
change in tax procedure "opens a veritable Pandora's box." 
</P>
<P>
If the ruling was allowed to stand, the board contended, the taxing agency 
might be forced "to set up booths at the gates of Disneyland or at the first 
tee of Pebble Beach golf links" to nab out-of-state residents who might perform 
work services while visiting California. 
</P>
<P>
But calm has settled after the state Supreme Court refused, on June 1, to hear 
an appeal of the decision siding with Newman. State officials and private tax 
lawyers and accountants agree the case will likely leave the entrance to 
Disneyland and fairways of Pebble Beach unpatrolled. 
</P>
<P>
Still, tax experts say the Newman decision will dramatically change the way 
nonresident entertainers of all sorts are assessed California income tax. 
Directly affected by the new taxation method -- in which entertainers will be 
taxed under a complex apportionment of their so-called "duty days" in 
California -- may be such big names as Robert Redford, Jessica Lange, Robert De 
Niro, Woody Allen, Mia Farrow and Christopher Walken. 
</P>
<P>
The total number of such taxpayers is unknown. The Franchise Tax Board said 
about 300,000 people file nonresident California tax returns each year, but the 
agency could not estimate how many of them work in show business or 
professional sports. The Screen Actors Guild was also unable to make an 
estimate, though a spokesman guessed that perhaps 5,000 of the union's 72,000 
members could be affected. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any Pandora's box. That was just a red herring," said 
Irving Axelrad, Newman's longtime personal attorney who participated in the tax 
litigation. "This case is important to the motion picture industry. It applies 
to artists, traveling conductors, musicians, motion picture talent including 
the stars and the supporting players." The case originated when Newman, whose 
principal residence is in Connecticut, sought a refund from the Franchise Tax 
Board for taxes originally paid on his income from "The Sting" from 1975 to 
1977. The money included both his $1-million fee and subsequent royalty 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
Under a contract typical in the movies, Newman guaranteed his exclusive 
availability to Universal Pictures during an 11-week period covering filming of 
the picture in Los Angeles and Chicago -- 25 days here and two in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Newman's contract stipulated he could do whatever he liked if he was not 
required on the set, but he had to appear within 24 hours after being ordered 
to do so by Universal. Among Newman's other activities was a ski vacation in 
Utah with Woodward; he also returned to his Connecticut home. 
</P>
<P>
When Newman eventually filed nonresident California tax returns covering his 
income from "The Sting," he adhered to existing state tax rules for 
entertainers that determined his California liability based on the proportion 
of shooting days in the state -- a formula that led to about 93% of his income 
from the film to be taxable here. 
</P>
<P>
Court records show that when Newman finally filed the return in 1975, two years 
after "The Sting" was released, he paid $24,639 to California. As he received 
royalty income from the film subsequently, he paid $7,336 in 1976 and $8,938 in 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
But Axelrad said the computation formulas seemed unfair and the Newmans 
eventually filed for a California refund. 
</P>
<P>
Newman argued that, since his Universal contract prohibited him from accepting 
other employment for the 11 weeks in question -- which, after subtracting 
holidays, included 54 work days -- his California tax liability should only be 
based on the proportion of that total period he actually spent in the state. 
Counting shooting, days he happened to remain in California when he was not 
before the camera and other time he spent here, the California total under that 
formula worked out to only 55%. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the Newmans filed a protest letter seeking a refund. The Franchise 
Tax Board turned them down. They sued. After a trial in 1987, the Newmans won. 
</P>
<P>
In March of this year, the Franchise Tax Board took the case to the Court of 
Appeal, which held that the tax agency was being hypocritical by treating 
nonresident athletes and entertainers differently. 
</P>
<P>
"Newman's exclusive contract period is the 'season' . . . and Newman is the 
'player,' " the court held in siding with the film star. Four weeks ago, the 
California Supreme Court refused to take a appeal by the tax board and turned 
down a tax agency request to strip the appeals court ruling of its status as a 
precedent applicable statewide. 
</P>
<P>
The verdict declared that a state taxation scheme devised for professional 
athletes also appeared to apply to entertainers. In a 1987 case before the 
state Board of Equalization and in a separate tax board opinion called an 
"audit ruling," state officials ruled that Joe Barry Carroll, a Golden State 
Warrior, was liable for California taxation for every day he spent in the state 
during the season -- whether he was playing in basketball games, traveling, 
practicing or simply having a day off. 
</P>
<P>
It was in the Carroll case that California tax officials introduced the term 
duty day, meaning any day on which Carroll was required to be available to his 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Carroll, who now plays for the New Jersey Nets, had argued his California tax 
obligation was determined only by the number of game days he spent in the 
state. The Franchise Tax Board ruling increased Carroll's tax bill under the 
same formula the Newmans used to lower theirs. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Vataha, of the Boston-based sports accounting and management firm Bob 
Woolf Associates, said the Carroll ruling and other tax state decisions have 
made the task of determining how much athletes owe to various government 
agencies incredibly complex. "It becomes a bigger and bigger bureaucratic 
situation," Vataha said. 
</P>
<P>
"Theoretically, you are going to have to file a state tax return in every state 
where you play a game. The net is probably not going to change the overall tax 
situation (in terms of the actual monies collected by each state). I'm not sure 
it creates any net gain for anyone but the accountants." 
</P>
<P>
Entertainment industry accounting experts say the implications of the Newman 
decision may introduce people in the arts to the same tax confusion athletes 
now face -- and that while individual tax bills in specific states may change 
dramatically, the net effect on total money involved may only be slight. 
</P>
<P>
"My first sense is that it is not going to have tremendous ramifications," said 
Matthew Krane of the West Hollywood firm of Bloom and Dekom, which handles 
business affairs for a number of top stars. 
</P>
<P>
Newman continues to receive royalty payments from "The Sting," Axelrad said, on 
which California tax is still being paid on about 55% of the money received. 
The California court decision is especially advantageous to Newman, Axelrad 
said, because Connecticut's only personal levy is on interest, dividends and 
other so-called "unearned" income. Newman's film royalties are "earned" income 
under Connecticut law, Axelrad said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Solomon, another local entertainment tax law expert, said that while 
the effects of the Newman decision are confined to a small number of artists 
who reside elsewhere and sometimes work in California, the legal principle the 
case establishes probably applies to artists in almost any medium. The ruling, 
Solomon said, may benefit rock and classical musicians -- especially those who 
travel to California to record since recording sessions are scheduled in much 
the same way as film production.

ACTRESS JEAN SIMMONS FULFILLS 'GREAT EXPECTATIONS' AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY MILLS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jean Simmons was 16 when David Lean launched her career in "Great Expectations" 
in 1946. The public was captivated by this dark-haired English beauty who 
played Estella, the stuck-up ward of the elderly recluse Miss Havisham. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-three years later, after starring in several dozen movies opposite such 
leading men as Kirk Douglas, Burt Lancaster and Marlon Brando, Simmons has 
returned to the Charles Dickens classic in a much less glamorous role. She 
plays the gray-haired, heavily wrinkled Miss Havisham in a six-hour miniseries 
of "Great Expectations," airing Sunday, July 10 and 11 on the Disney Channel. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not what I look like that counts," says Simmons, a refreshingly outspoken 
woman who was a great beauty in "Guys and Dolls," "The Robe" and "Elmer 
Gantry." "I'm much more concerned about performance. I did another of these 
elderly ladies in 'The Dawning,' Trevor Howard's last picture. I looked awful, 
but it was absolutely right for the part. My manager was appalled." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the majority of actresses in her age range, Simmons does not try to hide 
the passing years. For afternoon tea and cookies in her Santa Monica living 
room, she wears a white track suit. The trim of the suit matches the color of 
her short gray hair. When contemplating roles she might like to play, she says 
with a giggle, "If you hear of anything for middle-aged old bags, let me know." 
</P>
<P>
Twice-divorced (from actor Stewart Granger and director Richard Brooks) and the 
mother of two grown daughters, Simmons lives alone with her three dogs. She 
appears in two or three projects a year. In May, she did a guest spot on 
"Murder, She Wrote." A year earlier she reteamed with her "Spartacus" co-star 
Douglas in NBC's remake of "Inherit the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
"Kirk tracked me down at an Irish hotel and said, 'I know it's not a big role, 
but it's important to me for you to do it,' " she says. "I grew very fond of 
Kirk in 'Spartacus.' Some actors you work with, they could be a lamp stand." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons is not a workaholic. "I'm terribly lazy," she says. "I'm at a very 
fortunate stage, touch wood." She raps on the coffee table. "If there's 
something I want to do, I do it. But I don't have to. I've been at it a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
When the offer came to work again in Britain in the Dickens classic that 
launched her career, she responded: "Why not? On TV we're able to do so much 
more of the story than the film could cover. Dickens' books came out in serial 
form, so a miniseries should be terrific." 
</P>
<P>
Also starring Anthony Hopkins, John Rhys-Davies, Anthony Calf, Ray McAnally and 
Kim Thomson, "Great Expectations" is a typically Dickensian tale of an 
innocent's acquisition of wisdom. An orphan named Pip receives a gentleman's 
education with help from a mysterious benefactor. 
</P>
<P>
He falls in love with Estella, the young ward of Miss Havisham, a wealthy but 
embittered woman who was left at the altar on her wedding day and since then 
has never left her home or taken off her wedding gown. To win Estella, Pip must 
struggle against the mistrustfulness of men that Miss Havisham has implanted in 
her. Along the way, he also discovers the identity of his secret benefactor. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised to be offered Miss Havisham because I'm not usually thought of 
for roles like that," Simmons says. "I'm usually offered poker-up-the-behind 
parts." She laughs at the recollection of her playing so many stiff and 
humorless ladies. "I was in an awful lot of religious pictures. I did a lot of 
pictures where you stand around and you're supposed to look pretty. Now it's 
getting to be more fun." 
</P>
<P>
Although "Great Expectations" is set in the 19th Century, Simmons finds 
sections of it surprisingly relevant today. "There's this woman who stays in 
the house and never changes her dress," she says. "I understood Miss Havisham's 
'agoraphobia.' I went through that for a while myself. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to do a lot of walking with my dogs, but all of a sudden I couldn't go 
out the front door. I don't know how it happened. It lasted a couple of years. 
My friends would come here because they understood it. I did go out to work, 
and that got me out of the house. Now I'm fine, although I'm still very much of 
a homebody." 
</P>
<P>
No longer very well-known to the public, Simmons does not seem bothered in the 
slightest. She is amused to recount receiving some fan mail meant for Gene 
Simmons of the rock group Kiss. 
</P>
<P>
"I was reading this letter from a 10-year-old boy," she recalls. "It was the 
usual fan letter, saying things like, 'I think you're wonderful.' Then I got to 
the P.S.: 'I love it when you spit blood!' That's when I realized the letter 
wasn't for me." 
</P>
<P>
However, Simmons has had her share of laudatory fan mail since she accidentally 
became an actress almost five decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 14, I went to a dancing school for two weeks to get my 
certificate," she says. "During that period, a casting director came to the 
school, and I was asked if I would go down and read a few lines. Suddenly I was 
in a movie ("Give Us the Moon") and getting paid 5 a day. For two years I had 
bit parts, and then 'Great Expectations' turned up." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons made such an impression as Estella that Laurence Olivier was determined 
to cast her as Ophelia in his film version of "Hamlet." 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know anything about Shakespeare then," she says. "As a child I'd 
loathed Shakespeare at school because I didn't have a good teacher. So Larry 
sent me off to a coach." 
</P>
<P>
Simmons received an Oscar nomination for "Hamlet" and another nomination 21 
years later for "The Happy Ending." 
</P>
<P>
"God, I'm going to burst into tears," she says. "I'm going back 47 years. It 
was extraordinary for a Cockney kid from Cricklewood to have this happen. I'm 
still amazed by it. If I hadn't gone to that dancing school, I would have 
married and had children like my mum and had a normal life." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she became an actress, married Granger, one of the top romantic 
leading men of the time, and moved to Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"My career has had a lot of ups and downs, but basically it has been 
wonderful," she says.

THEATER OWNERS HIT ON-SCREEN ABC PROMOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUNA SNOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Moviegoers may be surprised when a new type of advertising pops onto the screen 
later this month. Beginning July 28, viewers at nearly one-third of the 
country's movie screens will be shown not only trailers for upcoming movies, 
but also one for upcoming ABC television shows. 
</P>
<P>
Marketing experts are praising the ingenuity of the idea, but some theater 
owners are crying foul. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's ludicrous," said Greg Rutkowski, vice president of West Coast 
operations for the 1,614-screen AMC Entertainment chain. "I don't think we 
should in any way, shape or form be encouraging our patrons to stay home and 
watch TV. Let's face it, if they're sitting at home watching ABC's fall lineup, 
they're not in the theaters. Television and the theaters really are not 
complementary businesses. It's the dumbest thing I've ever heard of." 
</P>
<P>
The ABC ad will be shown through Aug. 24 via Screenvision Cinema Network, the 
nation's largest independent broker of cinema advertising. With more than 5,700 
screens nationwide, Screenvision handles such advertisers as Kodak, Mitsubishi, 
Dr Pepper and Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan Theatres, which has 80 screens in Palm Springs, Santa Barbara and 
downtown Los Angeles, is the only chain with a large number of California 
theaters that contracts with Screenvision. But despite the contract (which is 
limited to Metropolitan's Los Angeles and drive-in theaters), Metropolitan 
President Bruce Corwin said that his chain has "great concerns" about the ABC 
ad. 
</P>
<P>
"By encouraging people to stay home," Corwin said, "it keeps them away from the 
movies. Our major job is to get people to go out to the movies." 
</P>
<P>
According to Mark Zakarin, ABC's vice president of marketing, the network's 
60-second spot will advertise two prime-time series -- the returning comedy 
"Anything But Love," starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Richard Lewis, and a new 
show about the Pony Express, "Young Riders." 
</P>
<P>
"We did 'Young Riders' because it is a show that we feel will have teen and 
young adult appeal (in addition to) the production value and action that will 
make it look really good on movie screens," said Zakarin, who described the 
program as a "new- age Western" with rock music and teen-age stars. 
</P>
<P>
The network selected "Anything But Love," he said, because of Curtis' following 
with movie audiences after starring in such hit films as "A Fish Called Wanda." 
</P>
<P>
Zakarin said the ad will be targeted at teen and young-adult audiences, who in 
the summer are "out doing things, like going to the movies" and are therefore 
hard to reach through regular on-air promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Although Zakarin and Alex Szabo, Screenvision's executive vice president, 
maintained that the ABC ad is based on entertainment values and takes a 
"soft-sell" approach, the spot has sparked off a whole new round in the 
continuing debate over whether advertisements of any kind have a place in movie 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an awkward position for us," said Bob Selig, president of the Theatre 
Assn. of California. "We have some of our members who favor advertising and use 
a great deal of it in their theaters, and others who are extremely opposed to 
it (and) firmly believe you do not have the right to impose (an ad) upon your 
theater patron." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen at several chains, including United Artists Theatres, SoCal Cinemas, 
Pacific Theatres and Landmark Theatres, spoke out flatly against screen ads, 
saying that they antagonize people who go to the movies in part to escape the 
barrage of ads on television. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how good the production values are, it's overwhelming when (a 
commercial) is up there on the screen," said Gary Meyer, Landmark's executive 
vice president. "They're shoving it down your face, and you can't leave, 
because it only lasts a minute or two and the movie starts before you're even 
out of the theater." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, agreed. "I'm 
opposed to all advertising in theaters," he said. "I just don't think that 
people who spend $5, $6, $7 to go see a movie should be bombarded with 
advertisements." 
</P>
<P>
Nor does advertising revenue necessarily offset potential costs, Landmark's 
Meyer pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to get a certain number of showings (of a film) in each day," he 
said. "When you add up all (the trailers for) coming attractions, you lose a 
show a day, and when you add on commercials you can lose another show or two a 
day." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Toronto-based Cineplex Odeon, which has 1,300 screens in the 
United States and an additional 575 in Canada, takes the pro-advertising stand. 
</P>
<P>
"Screen advertising has been practiced and accepted in Europe for decades," 
said Lynda Friendly, the chain's executive vice president. "Am I opposed to the 
concept of advertising at the movies? No -- especially if it's done right and 
if it has artistic and redeeming qualities." 
</P>
<P>
Although Cineplex Odeon does not contract with Screenvision and won't be 
running the ABC spot, the chain has run ads for such companies and products as 
Club Med, Coca-Cola, Nike, Dentyne, American Express, Chex Cereal and First 
Chicago Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Although several of the major studios refused to comment on the issue, Barry 
Reardon, president of distribution for Warner Bros., agreed with those who are 
againstmovie screen ads. "We don't condone running commercials with our 
movies," he said. "We think it belittles our features and is an annoyance. We 
are definitely opposed to it." 
</P>
<P>
But Charles Glenn, Orion's executive vice president of marketing, said he would 
be concerned only if the ads interfered with the time usually alloted for what 
he called the "traditional type of screen advertising" -- promos for upcoming 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Green, chairman of the National Assn. of Theater Owners, said that 
while deciding whether to accept advertising was up to individual theater 
owners, the issue of television being in competition with the movies was "not 
meaningful." 
</P>
<P>
"We're having a terrific summer," Green said. "TV is there -- it's a fact of 
life. But movies advertise on TV at least once an hour or more, and there's all 
kinds of programs geared at bringing people movie news." 
</P>
<P>
Said Screenvision's Szabo: "ABC's . . . competition is NBC and CBS, not 
theaters. Movies certainly advertise on TV, and the two are really 
complimentary advertising mediums." 
</P>
<P>
(According to the New York-based Television Bureau of Advertising Inc., motion 
picture advertising on television totalled $383 million in 1988, with $183.9 
million of that spent on network ads.) 
</P>
<P>
Orion's Glenn agreed that the two were not in competition, and was full of 
praise for ABC's ad idea: "They're going to be advertising to a captive 
audience and one that's heretofore unused to advertising (of that sort). It's a 
clever and interesting thing to do. . . . It's very resourceful on their part." 
</P>
<P>
Glenn did say, however, that he hoped the ad would make clear to viewers that 
it was for a fall TV show and not an upcoming movie. 
</P>
<P>
So what should moviegoers expect when that ABC ad hits their screens? 
</P>
<P>
According to ABC's Zakarin: "Viewers won't know it's anything but a trailer for 
a movie until the last three or four seconds. It's as soft a sell as you can 
have. It just says 'coming this fall' and shows the ABC logo. There's no night 
or time announced on the spot -- it's that soft. . . . The spot just makes you 
more aware of both of these shows, their appeals and charms." 
</P>
<P>
Zakarin said ABC would do follow-up studies on the ad's effectiveness after its 
monthlong run, and said that while "summer seems to be the most natural time to 
do movie screen advertising for TV shows . . . another time we could 
conceivably do this would be at Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
"But for now," Zakarin said, "we're sort of making this up as we go along."

It's a real estate deal like few to be found in Orange County. The property: a 
2,000-square-foot turn-of-the-century redwood farmhouse of historical value in 
San Juan Capistrano. The asking price: free. 
</P>
<P>
There is a catch, of course. The taker has to move the house -- possibly in 
pieces -- off its lot. And then it must be fixed up, which may cost as much as 
it would to buy one of the tract houses that will be going up in its place. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, its owner will have a real treasure, San Juan Capistrano history buffs 
say. The Rosenbaum house, named for the family that owned it for decades, is 
the last remaining farmhouse on Ortega Highway. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a piece of history, a piece of an old family that was very prominent at 
the turn of the century," said Ilse Byrnes, a San Juan Capistrano 
preservationist who has nominated many places for historical recognition. "It's 
a wonderful example of a farmhouse in San Juan, which was very famous for its 
farms, its walnuts, its oranges and avocados. This house was part of the 
history of San Juan." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a scrappy orchard of orange, lemon and other fruit trees is still on 
the 2.5 acres behind the now-dilapidated structure. 
</P>
<P>
Not for long, though. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have approved plans for property owners Patrick Meek and Cyndi 
Fritz to build seven single-family houses on the lot, but the approval requires 
Meek and Fritz to make a good-faith effort to find a taker for the house. The 
City Council has said that if no one steps forward to take the house, the city 
will do something to save it. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can't find someone -- before that house gets touched -- we want it to 
come back before the City Council. We don't want it destroyed," Mayor Gary L. 
Hausdorfer said. "The fact that it is approaching 100 years old is very 
significant. We don't treat these things lightly in this city." 
</P>
<P>
Even without the impending housing development, Meek and Fritz point out, the 
likelihood that the Rosenbaum house would have remained at that site, about 1 
1/2 miles east of Interstate 5, was doubtful. To say that it is situated on 
Ortega Highway is not much of an exaggeration. The house is perched on the 
shoulder of the road, only two lanes wide at that spot, which means drivers 
must execute a skillful bit of maneuvering to avoid it. Noisy 16-wheelers and 
speeding cars whiz by just a few feet from the front door. Caltrans plans to 
widen the highway to four lanes in late 1991 or early 1992, a spokesman said, 
and the new lane would run smack into the house. 
</P>
<P>
Although just about everyone agrees that the house is historically significant, 
its exact age is a matter of dispute. 
</P>
<P>
According to a California Department of Transportation report on the house, the 
40-by-44-foot main structure was built in 1912 on a wood foundation. It is made 
of redwood single-wall board-and-batten construction, the term for the style of 
building that has narrow strips of wood covering the seams of the wider boards. 
Two 20-by-8-foot additions on the rear and west side of the house were made in 
the 1920s, and a small guest house was added on the northeast corner of the lot 
in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
But Melvin Rosenbaum, who moved into the house as an 11-year-old in 1935, 
insists that it was built in the 1890s, and Byrnes said other research supports 
the claim for the earlier date. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Owner 
</P>
<P>
The house was originally built for Trinidad Goodwin, who managed the Mission 
Viejo Ranch. Rosenbaum's father, Edwin M. Rosenbaum, was a rancher too. The 
Rosenbaum family has been associated with farming in the San Juan Capistrano 
area since 1869, when Henry C. Rosenbaum settled in the community, according to 
Caltrans' report. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin Rosenbaum said that the Ortega Highway was always right outside the 
front door. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh yes, but it didn't have near the traffic in 1935. The trucks weren't that 
big, and the cars didn't go that fast," he said with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, as cars became swifter and trucks became ever bigger, the 
Rosenbaums remodeled the house and rented it out. When Rosenbaum's brother 
Edwin sold the property to Meek and Fritz, the new owners inherited some 
tenants, now living there rent-free. 
</P>
<P>
Meek, who is president of Meek Construction Co. of Dana Point, said people in 
the community have known for several months that he will give the house to 
anyone who can take it away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Commitment 
</P>
<P>
Actually, two people have already expressed interest in the house, although 
neither has made any commitment yet. 
</P>
<P>
Melvin Rosenbaum said that he would love to have the house himself but that he 
cannot afford to move it. He hopes, he said, that he can negotiate with Meek or 
another party to strike a deal whereby that party would pay for moving the 
house to his property in Trabuco Canyon. He would then restore it, he said, 
possibly using it to show antiques. 
</P>
<P>
Don Nadeau, a San Juan Capistrano masonry contractor with a love for old 
houses, has also expressed interest. Nadeau has had house movers out to look at 
the building. He was told, he said, that the house can withstand a move, 
although it might have to be moved in two pieces. He has been advised that 
moving it would cost at least $16,000, he said. Others in town said they have 
heard estimates as high as $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Nadeau said his problem has been finding a piece of land for the house. He 
would prefer to buy something on or near Ortega Highway, he said, as that would 
not only keep the moving cost down but also do more to maintain the historical 
significance of the house. 
</P>
<P>
Getting a hard estimate for restoration costs is even tougher. Meek and others 
say that stricter and costlier building standards will apply should the house 
be used as a dwelling, as opposed to a museum, office or meeting place. Meek 
estimates that restoring it would cost at least $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Nadeau said he wants to move into the farmhouse and that he would restore it 
himself over a period of years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Neat Details' 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of like the older style houses," he said. The Rosenbaum house "has some 
neat details inside, like around the doors, and the wood floors and old 
bathtubs. It's not fancy, but I don't like drywall and cottage-cheese ceilings. 
It would be neat to restore it, or just to have something that people can 
appreciate as a work of art." 
</P>
<P>
If all else fails, Hausdorfer said, the City Council will probably move the 
house someplace where it can be kept until its future is decided. Although that 
will take money, he said, "the council tries to reflect what the people of this 
community would like to see done, and there is a strong sense of historical 
preservation here." 
</P>
<P>
Marilyn Thorpe, chairwoman of the city Cultural Arts and Heritage Commission, 
said her agency had hoped Meek could move the Rosenbaum house farther back onto 
the lot, out of the path of the highway but still on its original property. It 
would thus have been incorporated into Meek's development of three- and 
four-bedroom houses. 
</P>
<P>
Meek said he looked into that possibility but that "the economics don't work." 
While saying he was sympathetic to the concerns of preservationists, he pointed 
out that had he and Fritz not come on the scene, "Caltrans eventually would 
have solved the problem" by demolishing it. 
</P>
<P>
Planning Commissioner Mary Jane Forster, a preservation activist, said she is 
heartened by the City Council's response but that she has also heard people say 
"they didn't want their tax dollars spent on 'that dilapidated house.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Vision' 
</P>
<P>
People "should have a vision about the house," Forster said. "Maybe it has 
gotten into deteriorated condition. Maybe it's not the finest construction by 
today's standard. But there's a contingency out there of people who cherish 
houses like this." 
</P>
<P>
And although some people say they do not want to see money spent on buying and 
restoring old homes, she said, their tunes change after the buildings are 
finished and open for view. "Everything that has been preserved has always been 
loved by the people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
History buff Byrnes is just happy that, whatever the means, it looks as if the 
farmhouse has been saved from the wrecking ball. 
</P>
<P>
"These old homes are not like today's tract homes, one like the other," Byrnes 
said. "In many of these older homes, a lot of love and understanding went into 
them. Each of them is different. They were all custom homes.

LA HABRA, CHILD-CARE PIONEER, STILL EXPANDING SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU FULTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was 15 years ago, long before child care became a trendy issue, when La 
Habra City Manager Lee Risner asked the state for $23,000 to begin an 
after-school program for 23 kindergarten students. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative bedroom community tucked in the northwest corner of Orange 
County seemed an unlikely pioneer in the area of child care, but Risner said 
the city was ahead of its time in realizing what is now a common theme among 
child-care proponents. 
</P>
<P>
"It became very obvious to me early on," Risner said, "that if we were 
interested in people being in the employment world rather than in the welfare 
world, we had better be interested in child care." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Center Opens Next Week 
</P>
<P>
Risner's request for $23,000 was approved by the state Department of Education, 
making La Habra the first city in California to become a child-care provider, 
according to state records. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1974, the city's programs have expanded steadily and now receive about 
$700,000 annually to care for nearly 300 children of low- and moderate-income 
families. And next week, La Habra is opening a new child-care center -- paid 
for with $265,000 in city funds -- which will offer before- and after-school 
programs for 90 children. 
</P>
<P>
"That doesn't surprise me at all," said Kay Witcher, regional administrator for 
the state Department of Education's child development section. "They have been 
very, very active and very vigorous in this area." 
</P>
<P>
Other Orange County cities, such as Irvine and Anaheim, are also getting into 
the child-care business. Last year, Irvine built a $1.2-million child 
development center in its City Hall complex to serve about 100 children of 
residents and city employees. Anaheim is using a $20,000 grant from the 
Department of Education to develop child-care programs in cooperation with the 
private sector. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Witcher said, 11 California cities were awarded state grants for 
child care. "We're seeing more and more cities express an interest," she said. 
</P>
<P>
La Habra started out as a reluctant provider of child care, Risner said. "We 
were the court of last resort. The money was available, but there was just no 
one else around to handle it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The first kindergartners in the program were cared for after school in local 
churches, recalled Faye Campbell, who has been the city's child-care 
coordinator since 1974. Just six months after that program started, Campbell 
was asking the state for more money to start a full-time day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
And when space ran out there, La Habra successfully got money to contract with 
local home day-care operators. About 30 infants and toddlers are now receiving 
care under this program, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
A crisis occurred last year, however, when Campbell and Risner learned that the 
city was about to lose its Head Start program, which educates 85 low-income 
youngsters a year before they enter kindergarten. The school where the Head 
Start classes were being held was scheduled to close. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than lose the program, Risner arranged to rent space from the La Habra 
Boys Club and had the city apply for federal money. The city now has a $250,000 
Head Start grant, and Risner is already looking for ways to expand the program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Parental Responsibility 
</P>
<P>
"We could double the number of students without half trying," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Risner speculated that one reason La Habra's efforts have enjoyed community 
support is that parental responsibility is a requirement of the program. 
</P>
<P>
The city holds monthly parenting workshops on such topics as child-rearing and 
earthquake preparedness. To be eligible for subsidized child care, a parent 
must either be working, training for a job or attending school. The child-care 
centers also serve as social service referral centers, dispensing information 
about other agencies that provide help in the areas of health, nutrition and 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
Parents pay for child care according to a sliding income scale, and can earn no 
more than 84% of the state's median income to qualify. For instance, a single 
mother with one child who makes about $16,000 a year would pay about $20 a week 
per child. 
</P>
<P>
For Cheryl Patterson, a 27-year-old single mother of two studying to become a 
teacher, La Habra's child-care program has been "a godsend." 
</P>
<P>
"If I hadn't been able to find La Habra, I doubt I would have been able to 
follow my education," Patterson said. "Families just need a little bit of help 
to make ends meet. Not much -- just a little." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell said most of the children in the city's child-care centers are from 
single-parent homes. The waiting list to get into the centers is six months to 
one year, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Calls From Mothers-to-Be' 
</P>
<P>
"I even have mothers call me when they're pregnant so they can get on the 
list," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Even while the furniture is being moved into La Habra's new child-care center, 
Risner and Campbell are plotting more ways to expand the city's services. 
Campbell would like to extend the operating hours -- currently 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
-- an hour or two later in the evenings to accommodate commuting parents. 
</P>
<P>
Risner is considering what South Coast Air Quality Management District 
pollution control proposals, such as a four-day workweek, may mean for child 
care. 
</P>
<P>
"People are going to be working strange hours," he said. "It would not surprise 
me if in two or three years we have child care going until 11 or 12 at night."

RINGLEADER OF ESCAPE BACK IN COUNTY JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An alleged master jewel thief who authorities believe masterminded the escape 
of five prisoners from Orange County Jail last year was returned to that jail 
Tuesday from South Dakota, where he was captured May 20. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Douglas Taylor, 36, suspected of a crime spree after his escape, now 
faces charges of robbery, kidnaping, rape, grand theft and escape. Taylor, who 
is also known as Michael Douglas Gianetti, will be arraigned Thursday, 
according to Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Larry Richey. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor and four other inmates escaped from the recreation area of the men's 
jail on Nov. 20 by rappelling down braided sheets from the top of the 
four-story building in downtown Santa Ana. Two inmates, one of whom had 
suffered a broken a leg, were captured immediately and the other two were 
caught two weeks later by FBI agents in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
The two guards on duty at the time were blamed for the escape. One was fired 
and the other was disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities finally tracked down Taylor in Rapid City, S.D., after he tried to 
pawn loose diamonds that law enforcement officials believed came from a Chicago 
jewelry heist. The Rapid City jeweler became suspicious of Taylor and called 
police. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor was awaiting trial in Orange County Jail last November, accused of 
committing seven robberies in Orange County, including the theft of more than 
$100,000 in gems from a Huntington Beach jewelry store last year. He was also 
facing trial in Los Angeles for 10 other robberies. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was extradited despite his plea that he feared for his life if he 
was returned to Orange County Jail. Last week, he finally agreed to drop his 
fight against extradition and return for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor also faces robbery charges in Illinois, Alameda County in Northern 
California and Des Moines, Iowa, authorities said.

100-MILE RACER WILL TACKLE 500, THEN MAYBE 3,000

Phil Millard says the record number of 100-mile races he rode on his bicycle 
last year was only a stepping stone to bigger things, such as a 500-mile race, 
and maybe even a 3,000-mile, cross-country race. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the challenge," said Millard, a 38-year-old printer. "It's another goal. 
I could sit down and say I did it. No matter what, no one could take it away 
from me." 
</P>
<P>
The Norwalk resident is the 1988 champion of the Ultra-Marathon Cycling Assn.'s 
"century" division. He rode 39 official century races last year, more than 
anyone else in the 1,500-member association, said John Marino, president of the 
Irvine-based group. The second-place finisher, Ray Balz of Long Beach, finished 
34 century races, Marino said. 
</P>
<P>
Millard has ridden six century races this year and is training every day for a 
500-mile race in October that will start in Valencia, run through Death Valley 
and finish in Twentynine Palms. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Race Starts in Orange County 
</P>
<P>
If Millard rides well enough, he will qualify for the 1990 Race Across AMerica, 
sponsored by the Ultra-Marathon Cycling Assn. The grueling event runs about 
3,000 miles. This year's race will begin Aug. 13 at the Orange County 
Fairgrounds and end in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Penseyres of Fallbrook holds the record time for the race, which he 
completed in eight days, nine hours and 47 minutes in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Millard, slender and tan, seems almost too casual as he talks about 
ultra-marathons, or races of more than 200 miles. 
</P>
<P>
"One guy in the association said ultra-marathoning is a dirty job but somebody 
has to do it," Millard said. "That says it all." 
</P>
<P>
Millard said he was not big on strenuous exercise until fairly recently. He ran 
a bit from 1969 to 1975, when he was in the Marine Corps. But in the years 
after his discharge, he was mostly a couch potato. 
</P>
<P>
Then in late 1983, a friend bet Millard that during the next six months he 
wouldn't finish a marathon run. Millard won the bet. He said he ran his first 
26.2-mile race, the Long Beach Marathon, in February, 1984. He ran the San 
Francisco Marathon the following August. His times were only average, Millard 
said, and his body did not take well to marathons. 
</P>
<P>
"I got stress fractures and shin splints," he said. "I wasn't really trained 
for the distance." 
</P>
<P>
Millard bought a bicycle in early 1985 while he was recovering. 
</P>
<P>
"I found it was much easier on my body, and never went back to running," 
Millard said. "I could go out and ride 100 or 200 miles and feel better than if 
I had run 26. It didn't seem like a hard decision." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Working Out to Fit Mood 
</P>
<P>
And there is the solitude, the emotional release, said Millard, who also likes 
to build model airplanes and read. 
</P>
<P>
"What I like the most about cycling is you can gear the workout to fit your 
mood," he said. "If you're upset about something, instead of breaking things 
you get out there and ride as fast as you can." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the century races, which range from 90 to 150 miles, Millard 
said he has ridden five races of more than 200 miles. Millard says his forte is 
endurance, which enabled him to be the century champ. 
</P>
<P>
"It's strictly ability -- he who grinds the longest," Millard said. 
</P>
<P>
He finished first in four century events, which usually take him about 5 1/2 
hours to complete, including stops to refill his water bottles. His cruising 
speed is about 20 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Millard, a bachelor, says he trains every day and logs at least 300 miles a 
week on his lightweight road bike in preparation for the 500-mile qualifying 
race. He says he intends to work up to 600-mile training weeks before the 
October race through Death Valley. 
</P>
<P>
If he qualifies, he must then try to attract sponsors to help finance his ride 
in the 3,000-mile Race Across America.

Out of a flurry of small commercial real estate transactions recently, here are 
some of the larger deals: 
</P>
<P>
Ermine Investments paid $2.6 million for a 22,000-square-foot warehouse and 
distribution building in Irvine that will become Ermine's headquarters. 
Triquest Development of Irvine sold the building, which is at 1 Mason Drive. 
</P>
<P>
MAM Properties bought a 47,000-square-foot neighborhood shopping center at 
Brookhurst Street and Katella Avenue in Garden Grove for $3.2 million. Selling 
was Hub Properties. 
</P>
<P>
Chi Wai Yip, a Lakewood investor, bought a 10,000-square-foot neighborhood 
shopping center at 5932 Westminster Ave. in Westminster. Selling -- for $1.4 
million -- was Albert Silver, Beverly Hills.

<TEXT>
<P>
Bob Smith fiddled with a toolmaking machine, one of an array of hulking devices 
that stock the machine shop at MiraCosta College. 
</P>
<P>
Rolled-up sleeves and grease-splattered forearms portray Smith as a hard worker 
who takes pride in his job -- grooming qualified machinists. 
</P>
<P>
"My machinists can and do make everything," Smith said. "From the tools that 
mold your eyeglass frames to the body of your car. Except for trees and some 
other living things, we make just about everything." 
</P>
<P>
So, when local manufacturers need machinists, they turn to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
But, these days, Smith can't fill their orders. 
</P>
<P>
"They call all the time and say, 'We need some skilled people,' " Smith said. 
"And all I can say is, 'Sorry, I don't have anybody for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
Declining enrollment in Smith's class is just another sign that confirms what 
San Diego manufacturers already know: Skilled machinists are a dwindling breed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Stinging Shortage 
</P>
<P>
Throughout San Diego County the decline can be felt, and in some pockets, like 
the north part of the county -- where recent business growth has drained the 
available labor pool -- the shortage stings a little more. 
</P>
<P>
Eaton Leonard Technologies, a Carlsbad machine-tool manufacturer, is a good 
example. The company has advertised for machinists through help-wanted ads in 
the local newspapers with little luck. "I think I got six responses for two 
weeks worth of ads," said Tom Emerson, Eaton's machine shop supervisor. "I 
think that's pretty lousy." 
</P>
<P>
LME, an Oceanside-based manufacturer of molds for aircraft parts that moved 
from Orange County in February, has had similar recruiting problems. "I'll tell 
you what the problem is, there's no new people coming in," said an LME 
spokesman who asked that his name not be used. "Nowadays, people think that 
they're too good to be in manufacturing." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the scarcity hasn't crippled manufacturers, but businesses aren't 
waiting for the problem to worsen. Many companies, both big and small, are 
reviving apprenticeship programs to upgrade employees' skills. Besides 
providing management the skilled labor that they need, such programs offer 
employees incentives too: the opportunity for better pay and advancement. 
</P>
<P>
But machinists are urging manufacturers to do even more. If a crisis is to be 
averted, they say, management must recruit youth to replace aging machinists 
now retiring in droves. 
</P>
<P>
"After the Korean War there was an abundance of machinists," said Ed Maudlin, 
president of District Lodge 50 of the International Assn. of Machinists. The 
union represents about 2,000 machinists in San Diego and Imperial counties. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people learned the trade under the GI Bill," Maudlin said. "But those 
guys have been at it for 30, 35 years, and now, they're ready to call it 
quits." 
</P>
<P>
The retirement of many machinists, coupled with fewer new workers entering the 
field, has caused an 11% decline in union membership over the past seven years, 
Maudlin said. 
</P>
<P>
And local businesses that employ machinists have noticed with dismay the 
downward trend. 
</P>
<P>
Besides advertising locally and nationally, Greene International West, an 
ordnance components manufacturer, has placed a standing order for skilled 
machinists with MiraCosta College for the last nine months. 
</P>
<P>
"We're always looking for skilled journeyman tool and dye makers, and 
machinists, because we're finding that they're getting harder and harder to 
find," said Wendy McFerran, personnel director for the Oceanside-based company. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that it's becoming a dying art," McFerran said. "There's simply not 
enough (machinists) to meet the demand." 
</P>
<P>
Now, instead of looking for skilled machinists, companies are producing their 
own. Increasing numbers of manufacturers are retraining current employees or 
recruiting inexperienced youth with the promise of better pay to work under the 
close supervision of a mentor -- for example, a skilled veteran employee. 
</P>
<P>
Under the training program created several years ago by machinists and the 
state Department of Industrial Relations, apprentices work full 40-hour weeks 
learning to operate various machines at the job site, as well as attend a local 
community college once or twice a week for additional training. 
</P>
<P>
For example, company apprentices who enroll at MiraCosta College take 10 
classes such as mathematics, drafting and machine tool operation, over a 
four-year period. The cost of such an education -- about $160 plus textbook 
costs -- initially is paid by the apprentice, who is reimbursed by his employer 
upon satisfactory completion of classes. 
</P>
<P>
For employers, the apprenticeship program offers two benefits, said V. David 
Johnson, a consultant with the Department of Industrial Relations who helps 
manufacturers set up such programs that produce state-certified journeymen 
machinists. Apprenticeships help employees learn how to work with various 
manufacturing equipment, not just one or two machines. And they offer financial 
incentives that could lure young people to the field. 
</P>
<P>
"You can come out of high school without any skills and start out making $7 an 
hour, which is about 50% of what a journeyman machinist makes," Johnson said. 
"And in four years, you can at least double" the initial starting pay. 
Typically, he said, it takes a machinist eight to 10 years to reach peak salary 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Becoming More Marketable 
</P>
<P>
Besides better pay, an apprentice who successfully completes the training, 
which requires logging 8,000 hours on several machines, becomes a full-fledged 
journeyman machinist. Reaching that plateau earns machinists state 
certification, making them more marketable. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, when you're 18, have no skills, this is a pretty good deal," Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Eaton Leonard Technologies, like many other companies, is setting up an 
apprenticeship program. It is similar to one used by Greene International West 
since early this year, McFerran said. The program, which started with two 
employees, is successful and has recently added another spot for an apprentice, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We posted an announcement of another apprenticeship program and got seven 
applicants, but we could only take one," McFerran said. "We would love to have 
taken more but an apprenticeship program takes a lot of time. They need a lot 
of hands-on training from our supervisors, which diverts them from their work." 
</P>
<P>
Although apprenticeships don't solve the immediate shortage, manufacturers who 
have experimented with the program support it wholeheartedly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good for morale and your employees see that there's opportunities to 
advance within the company," McFerran said. 
</P>
<P>
Maudlin, the union spokesman, applauds manufacturers' efforts to bolster their 
current work force, but says even greater measures must be taken. 
</P>
<P>
The next step: Recruit the youth. 
</P>
<P>
"Vocational training has taken a back seat to academics and a college degree," 
Maudlin said. "I'm not knocking a college education by any means, but it's not 
for everyone. All I'm saying is that if you don't want to go to college, then 
you should be told of the alternatives that lie before you." 
</P>
<P>
Maudlin says waiting to talk to high school students on "career days" is too 
late. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many high school kids who do poorly think at the last minute that they can 
become a machinist," Maudlin said. "Well, it's not that easy. You have to be 
good at reading comprehension for blueprint reading, you have to be able to do 
math. You have to let the kids know early, in junior high, that these things 
will be required." 
</P>
<P>
Without such recruiting efforts, Maudlin says, the humming sounds of machines 
could soon fall quiet. At the machine shop at MiraCosta College, the silence 
can already be heard. 
</P>
<P>
Like summers past, Smith, the machinist instructor, was preparing to teach a 
night course this year on basic machine tool technology. 
</P>
<P>
"We needed 16 people to enroll in order to hold the class," Smith said. "Only 
12 registered. We canceled the class." 
</P>

ALMANAC: APARTMENT SURVEY; 
</P>
<P>
RENTAL UNITS ON THE INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of apartments in Irvine has more than tripled since 1984, and rental 
units have more than doubled in Placentia and San Juan Capistrano. On the other 
hand, three county communities -- Fountain Valley, Seal Beach and Yorba Linda 
-- didn't add a single apartment from the end of 1984 to the end of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Countywide, the number of apartments increased 15.4% during the period to 
176,770, according to data compiled by the Census Bureau, local planning 
departments and Research Network Ltd. Anaheim, the county's most populous city, 
led in the number of apartments at the end of the period with 28,897, an 
increase of 10.1%. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of the apartments in the county have two bedrooms, according to 
the data. The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment was $668 a month at the 
end of 1988, and the average for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment was 
$848.

20 AMTRAK TRAINS DELAYED, TURNED BACK BY DOWNPOUR

Twenty Amtrak trains were either delayed or canceled today, with passengers put 
on buses as heavy rain covered tracks along sections of the railroad's heavily 
traveled Northeast corridor. 
</P>
<P>
Amtrak spokesman Cliff Black said about 10,000 passengers were affected by the 
flooding that covered tracks north of Wilmington, Del., with 6 inches of water 
and debris. One of three lines was reopened this afternoon, but repair crews 
were working to build up the damaged roadbed on the other two. 
</P>
<P>
Trains were creeping through the area at 5 m.p.h., said Black, delaying by 
about 30 minutes service on regular trains and the Metroliner express between 
New York City and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Whole Area Snarled 
</P>
<P>
Metroliner trains from both directions between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. were 
canceled, Black said. The train normally runs every hour from both New York and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Travel in that whole area is badly snarled and Amtrak train operations severly 
disrupted," Black said shortly before noon. Later, he said the rains had abated 
and full service was being resumed, but with delays still anticipated through 
the rest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The rains came as part of the remains of Tropical Storm Allison, which dumped 
rain on the South for more than a week. Heavy rains battered the 
Maryland-Delaware area and Philadelphia early today. Philadelphia got 5.5 
inches of rain in two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Black said rainfall in the Wilmington area was about 6 inches in two hours. 
</P>
<P>
Special buses set up to carry Amtrak passengers between Wilmington and 
Philadelphia and earlier between Wilmington and Baltimore were having 
difficulty because of flooding on roads near the tracks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The normally 25-minute trip between Wilmington and Philadelphia was taking more 
than two hours, Black said. 
</P>
<P>
He said several trains had to reverse direction and return to the stations they 
left, including two in Baltimore, several in Philadelphia and one at 
Wilmington.

Part of a crane perched on a subway work car smashed into a passenger train on 
an elevated track in Brooklyn today, then swung back violently, severely 
injuring the transit worker in the crane's cab. 
</P>
<P>
The crane's counterweight punched a 4-by-1-foot hole into the side of the first 
car of a Manhattan-bound N train at 10:06 a.m., Transit Authority spokeswoman 
Caren Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
Transit worker Frank Davila, 54, who was sitting in the crane's cab, was 
injured as the counterweight swung wildly back and forth. He was taken to Kings 
County Hospital and was listed in critical but guarded condition 
</P>
<P>
Although the crane's counterweight struck the train just opposite from where 
the passenger train's operator was sitting, no one else, including the 200 
passengers aboard the train, was hurt, Gardner said.

A 28-year-old Newport Beach man died when his motorcycle collided with a pickup 
truck making a U-turn at MacArthur Boulevard and San Joaquin Hills Road in the 
second traffic fatality in the county during the long Fourth of July weekend, 
authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
An 86-year-old woman was struck by a car as she was crossing a street in 
Huntington Beach on Monday in the earlier fatal accident. She died Tuesday at 
UCI Medical Center, said Bruce Lyle, a supervisor with the coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
The motorcycle driver, Dietrich Charles Long, was heading south on MacArthur at 
about 9:30 p.m. Tuesday when he was struck by a pickup driven by Ira Louis 
Radstone, 21, of Lancaster, Newport Beach Police Lt. Tim Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
A preliminary investigation showed that Radstone, who was driving north, 
apparently tried to make a U-turn over a painted center divider when he 
collided with Long, Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
Long, who was not wearing a helmet, hit the truck. The front wheel and fork of 
his motorcycle landed 200 yards away in a ditch, Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
He was treated by paramedics from the Newport Beach Fire Department and then 
transferred to Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach, where he 
died, Newman said. 
</P>
<P>
Police did not cite or arrest Radstone, Newman said, but an investigation is 
continuing.

Four Air Force paramedics parachuted into the Pacific 550 miles northwest of 
San Francisco today to give aid to a Korean merchant seaman injured in a fall 
into a hold on his ship. 
</P>
<P>
The rescue team climbed aboard the Lucky Transporter about 9:30 a.m., after 
dropping into the ocean near the ship, which was on a southeast course to Long 
Beach, said Petty Officer Dennis Hall, a spokesman for the Coast Guard rescue 
center in Long Beach. Hall said the 30-year-old sailor suffered a broken arm 
and other injuries. He was to be flown by helicopter to a San Francisco 
hospital when the ship came within range.

The election of Poland's new president will be postponed until after the visit 
next week by President Bush, a Communist official announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Politburo member Marian Orzechowski, leader of the Communist Deputies Caucus in 
the Sejm, said the election by the National Assembly could not be held earlier 
because state officials will be out of the country Friday and Saturday and will 
be busy after that with the Bush visit. 
</P>
<P>
Communist Party and Solidarity officials earlier had insisted the new president 
would be chosen before Bush's visit. The postponement appeared related to 
ongoing indecision over who will be nominated by the party for the new six-year 
office that will oversee the army and foreign relations. 
</P>
<P>
Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski had been the party's prime candidate, 
but he surprised the nation Friday by announcing he would not run and 
nominating Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak.

Gov. Bob Martinez announced today that he will call a special legislative 
session to take advantage of the U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing states to 
place more restrictions on abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The special session will come no later than a previously scheduled legislative 
meeting in October to consider transportation and growth management issues and 
could be sooner, Martinez, a Republican, said. 
</P>
<P>
Before the ruling, state House Speaker Tom Gustafson had said abortion should 
be dealt with in a special session so that it does not dominate next spring's 
regular session. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours of the high court's ruling, state Rep. Tom Banjanin filed a bill 
that would enact many of the restrictions the high court allowed.

McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said today that it will extend its 
$120-per-share hostile takeover bid for LIN Broadcasting Corp. until July 20. 
</P>
<P>
McCaw said it is considering whether to adjust that offer and will announce its 
decision next week. The company reserved the right to extend the offer beyond 
July 20. The offer was due to expire at midnight Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A revision of the takeover bid would reflect LIN's legal loss to Metromedia 
Inc. last week over the right to buy Metromedia's interests in cellular 
telephone systems in Philadelphia and New York, McCaw said.

Share prices of Consolidated Gold Fields, the world's No. 2 gold producer, 
dropped sharply today following the British mining conglomerate's decision to 
accept a lower-than-expected bid from Hanson PLC. 
</P>
<P>
Clearing the way for the largest corporate takeover in British history, Gold 
Fields' board accepted the revised $5.6-billion offer from Hanson Tuesday 
night. The bid values each Gold Fields share at $24.50 -- $22.90 in cash and 
$1.60 in a special dividend and Hanson share warrants. 
</P>
<P>
Gold Fields shares dropped 24 cents to $23.57 in early trading today, 
reflecting disappointment in the agreed offer. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good deal for Hanson," Huw Williams, mining analyst at Kleinwort Benson 
Securities, said today. "Shareholders were really given no option -- no other 
bidder would come in -- so they'll probably get rid of their shares and be 
happy about it."

on the New York Stock Exchange after the Belzberg group said it had acquired a 
9.85% interest. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no interest in meeting with the Belzbergs," Armstrong Chairman William 
W. Adams said in a strongly worded declaration that the company is not for 
sale. The incipient takeover battle quickly moved into the courts, with both 
companies filing lawsuits over, among other things, the validity of Armstrong's 
"poison pill" shareholder rights plan, which is intended to prevent a hostile 
takeover. 
</P>
<P>
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Belzberg group 
said it intends to file for antitrust clearance to buy 50% or more of Armstrong 
stock.

Wall Street stocks finished a trace higher today after the market recovered 
completely from an early slide triggered by a fall in the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 3.79 points at 2,456.56. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 5 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 879 up, 552 down and 508 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 127.70 million shares, up from 68.87 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose .74 to 179.25. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier the Dow index had lost about 16 points in reaction to the dollar's fall 
below 1.9 West German marks for the first time in two months. 
</P>
<P>
But the market recovered around noon, helped in part by renewed interest in 
takeover issues and some futures-related buying. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
In a Wary Mood 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said recent economic reports showing a further slowdown in business 
activity over the last couple of months had put investors in a wary mood. 
</P>
<P>
They said people who had been enthusiastically embracing hopes for a "soft 
landing" now have begun to wonder whether something a bit bumpier might be in 
store. 
</P>
<P>
Confirmed optimists on Wall Street argue that the Federal Reserve will counter 
any such perils by relaxing its credit policy, giving the economy a shot of 
adrenaline and allowing interest rates to fall. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's policy-setting group, is 
meeting today and Thursday to consider what to do next. Evidence of its 
decisions may be forthcoming soon in the credit markets. 
</P>
<P>
A sell-off overseas and a weak dollar helped depress bond prices today, while 
short-term interest rates headed lower amid continued speculation that the 
Federal Reserve will ease its credit policies. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond tumbled 7/8 point, or around $8.75 per 
$1,000 face amount, by midday. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, 
jumped to 8.13% from 8.06% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The financial markets were closed on Tuesday in observance of the Independence 
Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Bond traders attributed today's downturn to the dollar's decline in foreign 
exchange and to heavy selling of U.S. bonds in Japan, with some pointing to the 
sale of $500 million of 30-year securities by a trust bank there. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said the Japanese are concerned that the dollar would continue to 
decline as the Fed eases short-term interest rates to prevent the U.S. economy 
from falling into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Open Market Committee began its two-day policy-making meeting 
today, and many analysts predict that the consensus there will be toward easing 
credit. 
</P>
<P>
Short-term rates plunged as a result today. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.04% as the discount plunged 16 
basis points to 7.79%. Yields on six-month bills fell to 7.97% as the discount 
fell 5 basis points to 7.57%. Yields on 1-year bills held at 8.02% and the 
discount was unchanged at 7.47%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
But the federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
unchanged from Monday at 9 7/16%. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term 
government issues were unchanged to 1/16 point lower, intermediate maturities 
fell between 1/8 point and 11/32 point and long-term issues dropped from 1/2 
point to 7/8 point, according to Telerate Inc.

NO JURISDICTION RULING IN ROSE CASE TILL JULY 17

A federal judge today said he will not decide until at least July 17 whether to 
move Pete Rose's lawsuit against baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti 
from state to federal court. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge John D. Holschuh met with lawyers for both sides this 
afternoon and set a timetable for deciding jurisdiction for the lawsuit that 
will delay a decision for nearly two more weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Holschuh gave baseball's lawyers until July 12 to file papers arguing that the 
case should be taken from Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Norbert A. Nadel. 
Rose's lawyers will then have until July 17 to file their response. 
</P>
<P>
Holschuh's ruling means that a hearing for a preliminary injunction scheduled 
by Nadel for Thursday in Cincinnati cannot be held. 
</P>
<P>
Nadel has granted Rose a temporary restraining order that prevents Giamatti 
from deciding the Cincinnati Reds manager's fate. The order protects Rose from 
suspension or firing, and those protections will remain in effect while 
Holschuh considers the jurisdictional question. 
</P>
<P>
Rose wants to keep his lawsuit in the state court in Cincinnati. But baseball 
argues that it should be moved to the federal court. 
</P>
<P>
The question of which court gets to handle Rose's lawsuit could be pivotal in 
deciding the outcome. Federal courts have repeatedly upheld the sweeping powers 
of the baseball commissioner, while Nadel has shown a willingness to go into 
what he described as "uncharted waters" in handling the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
"Federal courts are much more aware of the needs of baseball and much more 
willing to accept the authority of baseball and the commissioner," baseball 
lawyer Louis Hoynes Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
Rose's lawyers had expected baseball to try to change the courtroom in which 
the lawsuit will be heard. They argue that the matter belongs in the state 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
"Federal court has no jurisdiction over this case," Robert Stachler, one of 
Rose's lawyers, said.

Soo Nyung Kim of South Korea bettered her own world record in women's 
individual competition as qualifying rounds at the World Archery Championships 
wound up today with shooting over 30 and 50 meters. 
</P>
<P>
Kim, the Olympic gold medalist, added 685 points to her first-day scores over 
60 and 70 meters for a total of 1,369 points, 16 more than the four-distance 
world's best she set at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Kim, who holds both world records over the shorter distances, finished the 
qualifying round in first place with compatriot Hee Kyung Wang second at 1,333 
points. U.S. archer Denise Parker is third with 1,326. 
</P>
<P>
In men's individual competition, Stanislav Zabrodsky of the Soviet Union 
outpointed Allen Rasor on the 50-meter target to move into a tie for the lead 
with the 16-year-old American. Olympic gold medalist Jay Barrs of the United 
States qualified with a ninth-place finish of 1,317 points, one place ahead of 
defending world champion Vladimir Esheev of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Triple world champion Rick McKinney of the United States advanced into the next 
round with an eight-place jump to 21st after a disappointing showing over the 
longer distances when the tournament opened Tuesday.

JIM FINKS OF LOSERS-INTO-WINNERS FAME SEEN AS ROZELLE REPLACEMENT

Jim Finks, who once beat John Unitas for a quarterback job but is better known 
for turning three losing teams into winners as an executive, is expected to be 
chosen Thursday as the NFL's first new commissioner in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
According to several NFL sources, Finks, who will turn 62 on Aug. 31, will be 
the only recommendation to the NFL owners by the six-member selection 
committee. In fact, Finks met with the committee in New York on Tuesday to 
finalize the details of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
The vacancy was created when Pete Rozelle shocked the owners by announcing his 
retirement in March after 29 years. Rozelle's tenure was the second longest of 
any commissioner in a major sport; only the NHL's Clarence Campbell served 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to recommend one man. We were told to identify a guy and that's 
what we're going to do," Wellington Mara of the New York Giants, co-chairman of 
the committee, said today. He would not confirm that Finks is that man and said 
the other owners do not have to abide by the nomination. Nineteen of the 28 
teams must vote for the candidate for him to be elected. 
</P>
<P>
The three teams Finks took as losers and turned into winners are the New 
Orleans Saints, the Chicago Bears and Minnesota Vikings.

NFL MISSTATES DRUG PROBLEM: MAGAZINE; 
</P>
<P>
SPORTS ILLUSTRATED SAYS LEAGUE BLOWS UP ISSUE TO JUSTIFY HARD LINE 
</P>

The NFL's drug problem is not as serious as the league makes it out to be, 
according to Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
In this week's issue, the magazine said the NFL has turned up "scant evidence" 
of illicit drug use by players but deliberately gives the impression that it 
has a serious problem because it wants to maintain its strong anti-drug policy. 
</P>
<P>
Sports Illustrated said it "has turned up widespread irregularities, 
inconsistencies and misrepresentations in nearly every facet of the NFL's drug 
program. League officials have misstated the dimensions of drug use among 
players . . . depending on their public relations needs of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
"They have seldom bothered to distinguish between players who are addicted and 
those who have used drugs recreationally." 
</P>
<P>
NFL spokesman Joe Browne reacted to the story by saying: 
</P>
<P>
"Sports Illustrated has criticized our office in the past for not doing enough 
to address the drug issue. Now, they apparently are claiming that the NFL drug 
problem is not that serious. Editorial consistency evidently is not one of the 
magazine's virtues." 
</P>
<P>
The magazine says a "probable explanation" for the NFL's not divulging its low 
numbers of positive tests is that "to justify its brass-knuckles drug policy, 
the NFL needs to give the impression that drug use by players is widespread. 
</P>
<P>
"The NFL has seized upon the perception that professional sports has a drug 
problem and has used that perception to try to improve the league's image and 
to manipulate players. The NFL tests players and retests them and suspends them 
and releases their names, and the public assumes that Rozelle &amp; Co. mean 
business about drugs."
