<TEXT>
<P>
Fourteen Israeli bus riders were killed Thursday in a fiery crash caused by a 
Palestinian passenger who grabbed the steering wheel from the driver, yelled 
"God is great!" and sent the bus careening off a highway and down a steep 
ravine, witnesses and police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven people, including the driver, the suspect and seven U.S. citizens, 
were injured in what officials likened to a terrorist attack. Most of the 
victims were not identified. Government radio said the suspect's father was 
riding on the bus and was among those injured. 
</P>
<P>
It was the worst such incident since 1978, when 33 people died in a shoot-out 
between Israeli forces and Palestinian terrorists who raided Israel from the 
sea and hijacked a bus near Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's incident, the red public bus, No. 405 on the busy Tel 
Aviv-Jerusalem route, left Tel Aviv at 11:15 a.m. The crash occurred half an 
hour later as the bus was about to pull up an incline into the Judean Hills, 9 
miles from Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Account by Driver 
</P>
<P>
The driver, Moshe Elul, told Israel government radio that "a man came up to me, 
and at that moment, I thought maybe he wants some information like a lot of 
people ask along on the way. 
</P>
<P>
"He jumped on me and shouted, 'Allahu Akbar!' (God is great) and pulled the 
wheel with all his might to the right . . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I fought with him using my left leg to push forward with all my might. But he 
had got into a sitting position with his legs placed against the front of the 
bus in order to gain strength and stability, and like this we rolled down." 
</P>
<P>
"Allahu Akbar" is a Muslim call to prayer and battle. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, described as a bearded Palestinian in his 20s, sustained moderate 
injuries in the chest and head and was under detention in Hadassah Hospital in 
Jerusalem. He made no statement regarding the circumstances of the incident, 
according to police who guarded his bed in the hospital's emergency ward. 
</P>
<P>
"We know for certain that this man is the attacker," Police Commissioner David 
Krauss said. "Maybe he was the one who also planned it. Inside the bus, he 
acted alone." 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir vowed to "do everything to uproot these murderers 
and those who sent them." 
</P>
<P>
He called the crash "an act of murder planned by a hateful, horrible mind. We 
are reaching here heights of hatred nurtured by unending (Palestinian) 
incitement." 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said the incident helps explain Israeli security 
fears. 
</P>
<P>
"Every couple of weeks, we have to face tragic incidents like that, where a 
Palestinian terrorist causes casualties. . . brutal, fanatical, inhuman attacks 
on civilians, " he said. "It's an indication of the difficulties that Israel 
faces in the Middle East, surrounded by Arab countries with an Arab population 
-- very volatile, very fanatical." 
</P>
<P>
For 19 months, Palestinians have been conducting an uprising against Israeli 
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Most of the hundreds of victims of 
the violence have been Arabs, but more than 20 Israeli Jews have also died -- 
not counting Thursday's victims -- including some in Israel proper. 
</P>
<P>
At the scene of the bus crash, army and civilian rescuers worked until 
mid-afternoon to pull bodies from the blackened wreckage. The bus flipped at 
least once before coming to rest upside down and bursting into flames 200 feet 
below the heavily traveled highway. 
</P>
<P>
An army helicopter ferried the dead and wounded from the ravine up to the 
highway, where they were picked up by larger helicopters and by ambulance and 
taken to hospitals in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
As the news of the crash spread around Israel, radio talk shows became 
passionate forums for expounding the dangers of having Arabs in the midst of 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there is a very easy way to avoiding these incidents," said one 
caller. "We must stop minorities from getting on public transport." 
</P>
<P>
Others asked for the death penalty to be enacted. "These incidents would not 
occur if they knew the punishment was death," one radio listener said. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the evening, Israel Radio reported a spate of beatings of Arabs in 
Jerusalem, in apparent reaction to the bus crash. 
</P>
<P>
The incident marked the latest turn in a cycle of intercommunal violence 
provoked by the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and 
Israel's response to it. In recent months, lone Palestinian knife wielders have 
attacked and killed Israelis on the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Two 
soldiers have been kidnaped this year while hitchhiking; one was found shot in 
the head, and the other is still missing. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the underground leadership of the uprising called on Palestinians to 
take revenge on Israeli soldiers and settlers in the West Bank and Gaza for the 
deaths of Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
Settlers, taking hikes to assert their rights in the West Bank, have shot and 
killed two Arabs in recent weeks. The toll on Palestinians in the uprising is 
mounting steadily; more than 500 have died at the hands of soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
The attack on the bus prompted the Labor Party to postpone a meeting it had 
scheduled to reconsider continued participation in the coalition government 
with Shamir's Likud. Some Labor officials had objected to changes made by the 
prime minister this week to Israel's proposal for elections in the West Bank 
and Gaza and have threatened to leave the partnership.

PAINFUL SLUMP IS FORESEEN BY FEW ECONOMISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, as worried investors see it, the U.S. economy is teetering on the 
cliff's edge, while the next recession waits perilously below. 
</P>
<P>
But despite a streak of negative economic news that sent the stock market 
tumbling last week, many analysts say the fears are overblown. The economy has 
lost much of the pizazz it showed in 1988, and signs of a slowdown are 
mounting, most agree. But only a minority forecast that a painful slump is 
imminent. 
</P>
<P>
"We're certainly not looking at measures which indicate the economy is falling 
into an abyss," said Robert H. Chandross, chief North American economist at 
Lloyds Bank in New York. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cockpit Jargon 
</P>
<P>
To describe the economy's choppy course, analysts lately have been using terms 
that might be more expected in airplane cockpits than corporate conference 
rooms. Here are their most likely scenarios: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The soft landing. Under this outlook -- the most widely held -- economic 
growth will be sluggish as inflation and interest rates fall. Engineers for 
such a landing would be members of the Federal Reserve Board, who pushed 
interest rates up earlier in the year. That was because high employment and 
bustling factories suggested inflation might become more serious, and they 
sought to cool off economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
"Pieces are still in place for the soft landing to be realized," declared 
Norman E. Mains, chief economist at the Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards 
investment firm in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The hard landing. This is the view -- which gripped the stock market last 
week -- that a recession could begin shortly. It is based on the theory that 
the higher interest rates, which have started to recede, choked off growth for 
the near future. It is backed up by various signs of lackluster economic 
activity. "We think a recession is at hand," said Donald H. Straszheim, chief 
economist at the Merrill Lynch investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The delayed hard landing. In this alternate scenario, the economy displays 
latent strength in the coming months, inflation rises -- and the Fed responds 
with another hike in interest rates. "The booming economy would likely lead to 
a recession in 1990," warn economists at the WEFA Group, a consulting firm in 
Bala Cynwyd, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No landing (or stagflation). Such a condition, experienced in the late 
1970s, would mean stubborn inflation with economic growth that is tepid at 
best. "I think we're there for the next year," said David Hale, chief economist 
at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
While the outlooks vary wildly, analysts agree on this: Economic growth has 
wound down in recent months, perhaps to a rate of under 2%, compared to rates 
of about 4% in past years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cooling-Off Period 
</P>
<P>
A whole range of signals, including consumer spending, housing construction and 
manufacturing employment, point to the cooling-off process. Late last week, the 
Commerce Department reported that May factory orders -- for big-ticket items 
sold by makers of oil refineries, computers, airplanes and other products -- 
fell 2.5%, the steepest slide in 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
A few days earlier, it said that in May the index of leading economic 
indicators -- a broad gauge of economic health -- took its worst fall since 
right after the 1987 stock market crash. Employment growth has been slowing, 
along with factory operating rates and other signals of business strength. 
</P>
<P>
But believers in a soft landing -- sluggish growth -- argue that the conditions 
for a serious slump aren't apparent. At least a little vitality remains in 
spending by consumers and companies, they say, both of which may benefit from 
an easing of interest rates that began in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"There's widespread evidence of a much slower economic growth rate," said 
Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, Pa. "But we 
really haven't seen the rapid rise in inflation, the speculative boom-like 
environment that in the past has been the harbinger of a recession." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, a debate remains as to the economy's greatest threat -- inflation or 
recession. Inflation ran at a 6.7% annual rate for the first five months of 
this year, although most analysts peg the basic pace closer to 5%. 
</P>
<P>
A new piece of evidence in the debate will become available today when the 
Labor Department releases its June employment figures. Along with other 
statistics, job creation has tailed off lately, with an average of just 161,000 
new, non-farm jobs created in the March-May period, compared to 296,000 new 
jobs created in the previous three months. In the past, investors have viewed 
larger numbers of new jobs as signs that the economy was overheating and 
threatening more inflation. 
</P>
<P>
"If the employment numbers are weak, I'll have to re-evaluate all this," said 
Michael Penzer, a senior economist with the Bank of America in San Francisco 
and an adherent of the soft landing theory. 
</P>
<P>
For now, however, Penzer believes the economy is strong enough to elude a 
jarring downturn while weak enough to avoid a major climb in inflation. Such a 
course seems to be the goal of the Federal Reserve Board, which in June began 
easing short-term interest rates, a development likely to aid growth. Since the 
beginning of June, the federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge each other 
on overnight loans -- has fallen to about 9 1/2% from the 9 7/8% it had clung 
to since February. 
</P>
<P>
Recession skeptics are quick to point out that Americans may respond to lower 
borrowing charges with an increase in buying homes, cars and other major items. 
Consumer spending represents about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
"With the mortgage interest rates backing off as they have been for six weeks 
or so, it's much more affordable for many families to be back in the housing 
market," said Glenn Crellin, an economist with the National Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some argue that changes in the national and global economies now make 
it unlikely that the whole United States will suffer a recession at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"You tend to have a recession in Texas and a boom in Seattle," said John 
Rutledge, chairman of the Claremont Economics Institute, a private economics 
consulting firm. "We haven't had a recession for the whole country in seven 
years." The outlook is not unanimous, however. Some analysts take a darker view 
of the recent data and conclude that a national downturn is about to begin. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gotten a host of statistics in the last few weeks that are uniformly 
weak," said Merrill Lynch's Straszheim, who forecasts a mild recession this 
year. "People's concerns about the economy are changing from inflation to 
recession." 
</P>
<P>
There are other economic concerns besides the recent statistics. Through 1988, 
for example, much of the U.S. economy's growth was propelled by rising exports, 
fueled by a weaker dollar that gave American manufacturers price advantages 
over their foreign competitors. The dollar has rallied in recent months, 
however, raising new questions about whether American manufacturers will be 
able to hold onto their newly gained competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
The various concerns have been evident in the stock market, which before last 
week tended to greet signs of economic weakness as news of lower inflation. But 
last week, the psychology shifted drastically as investors began to worry about 
a full-blown recession. The Dow Jones industrial average lost more than 91 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Some experts counsel that such swings in investor psychology are silly, because 
individual statistics are often misleading and the U.S. economy is so large and 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of like watching the Fourth of July fireworks," said Rutledge. "You 
'ooh and ah' when they come out, but the numbers are calculated in the basement 
of the Commerce Department, and they're two steps removed from the real world." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economy Roars Back 
</P>
<P>
If the current economic jitters prove exaggerated, it will not be the first 
bout of investor anxiety during the current expansion that proves unwarranted. 
Many expected a recession after the October, 1987, stock market crash, but the 
economy roared back to life in early 1988, propelled by lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Despite widespread fears that consumers would cut back on their spending plans 
after the crash, it didn't happen. The recent signs are that consumers continue 
to feel optimistic about their economic future. A June survey of 5,000 
households by the Conference Board, a business research organization, found 
that consumer optimism has stayed at a robust level since last year. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the consumer remains in good spirits, there is faint likelihood 
that the economy will take a bad turn," said Fabian Linden, executive director 
of the board's Consumer Research Center.

JOURNALIST'S DEATH UNRAVELS NETWORK; 
</P>
<P>
KILLING IN MEXICO REVEALS TRAIL OF POLICE CORRUPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mexican journalist Manuel Buendia dedicated his life to muckraking, but it is 
his death that has suddenly exposed an underworld of police corruption and 
brought down an entire police department. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure to solve the 1984 assassination, the government last month 
arrested the former commander of Mexico's secret police and accused him of 
masterminding "Operation News" -- the killing of Buendia. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than quiet the clamor, however, the arrest has unraveled a dark network 
of secret-police officials implicated in everything from drug trafficking to 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
Seven more members of the defunct Federal Security Directorate have since been 
jailed, including two who had become co-directors of the Mexico City police 
department's intelligence unit. The government then dismantled the 
controversial intelligence unit where, it turned out, most of the former secret 
police had found work. 
</P>
<P>
The Buendia case has all the elements of a thriller -- an alleged gunman 
subsequently shot dead in a telephone booth, contradictory testimony from 
another jailed "gunman." But it is unfolding in daily newspapers and magazines, 
where Mexican journalists are asking very serious questions about how high the 
corruption might have reached. 
</P>
<P>
Did former President Miguel de la Madrid find out who killed Buendia? What 
about his interior secretary, Manuel Bartlett Diaz, who was responsible for the 
police force? The media suggest that Bartlett Diaz, now education secretary, 
and former Mexico City Atty. Gen. Victoria Adato, now a Supreme Court justice, 
may have participated in a five-year cover-up of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Delivering his final report on the case last Friday, special prosecutor Miguel 
Angel Garcia Dominguez asserted the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Support Cited 
</P>
<P>
"President De la Madrid and Interior Secretary Bartlett gave me their complete 
support for solving the case," Garcia Dominguez said. 
</P>
<P>
Although many questions remain unanswered, the case has shed light on other 
crimes such as the 1985 torture-death of U.S. drug agent Enrique S. Camarena 
and a San Diego-to-Mexico City car theft ring. Like the Buendia killing, both 
involved members of the Federal Security Directorate. 
</P>
<P>
A police source explained: "The commanders had become powerful. They controlled 
not only their people but the movement of illegal merchandise, drug 
trafficking, arms, cars -- anything where money could be made in grand scale. 
</P>
<P>
"The Buendia and Camarena killings were not directly related, except the common 
denominator was the Federal Security Directorate. The people made so much 
money, and they were so powerful, that they felt unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
"Why kill a Buendia and a Camarena? Why kill anyone else who stands in your 
way? Because they're in your way. These are the most notable cases, but many 
other people were killed or disappeared as they became a threat." 
</P>
<P>
Buendia, who routinely published exposes in his "Private Network" column in the 
Excelsior newspaper, was shot in the back at a parking lot next to his office 
in the busy Zona Rosa neighborhood on the afternoon of May 30, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The columnist had made so many powerful enemies over the years that theories 
quickly abounded on his murder. There were more than 275 hypotheses and dozens 
of suspects. Among them: the CIA, oil workers union chief Joaquin Hernandez 
Galicia and a violent right-wing group from Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
Also among the early suspects was Jose Antonio Zorrilla, commander of the 
secret Security Directorate. Zorrilla appeared at the scene within minutes of 
the murder and, it was said, sent his men directly to Buendia's office to 
remove incriminating evidence. 
</P>
<P>
Many dismissed Zorrilla as a suspect because he was a source for Buendia -- 
even, some would say, something of a friend. Weeks before he was killed, 
Buendia had written a column praising Zorrilla and the work by the security 
police. The two had practiced target shooting together, and Zorrilla gave 
Buendia a gun as a present. 
</P>
<P>
But it was also said that Buendia was about to publish information linking 
Zorrilla to drug traffickers. Zorrilla himself took up the initial 
investigation, although the case was outside his jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
President De la Madrid condemned the killing and promised action, but Proceso 
magazine, which has followed the case closely, charges that a cover-up soon 
began. An official investigation, delivered to Mexico City Atty. Gen. Adato 14 
months after the killing, named former police agent Jose Luis Ochoa Alonso as 
the "material author," or gunman. Ochoa, called El Chocorrol (Chocolate Roll) 
because of his dark skin, reportedly worked for Zorrilla until he was killed 
six weeks after Buendia while making a call at a public telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Proceso notes that a month after receiving the report, Adato declared the 
assassination was "not political" and stated that there were an array of 
suspects. De la Madrid named her to the Supreme Court, and her successor in the 
attorney general's office, Renato Sales Gasque, said he had to begin the case 
over again. 
</P>
<P>
In February, 1987, Sales also announced the Buendia killing was "not a 
political case, but a police case." He said El Chocorrol had been eliminated as 
a suspect for lack of evidence. In January, 1988, the government assigned 
Garcia Dominguez as special prosecutor on the case, and he too said he would 
begin the Buendia investigation from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office last Dec. 1 vowing, like his 
predecessor, to clean up government corruption. But unlike De la Madrid, who 
stopped after jailing two government officials, Salinas has kept up a steady 
pattern of arrests: union chief Hernandez Galicia, stock market tycoon Eduardo 
Legorreta, reputed drug lord Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo and other lesser-known 
traffickers and officials. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition politicians charge that Salinas is undertaking a series of 
publicity-seeking "spectacular blows" without fighting systematic corruption. 
But Ed Heath, the departing chief of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 
here, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
"There is somebody at the top to start to set new standards. . . . There is at 
least the outward conviction of a leader who says, 'I want this changed.' A lot 
of people in the lower ranks of state and federal law enforcement are fearful 
they might lose their jobs now because the Mexican government is trying to 
clean up this problem. We are very encouraged by what we see," Heath said. 
</P>
<P>
On June 12, the government announced that former police commander Zorrilla was 
the "intellectual author" of the Buendia murder. Zorrilla was not at home when 
police first arrived to arrest him, but he was picked up at another residence 
days later. 
</P>
<P>
A week later, former secret police officer Juan Rafael Moro Avila was arrested. 
Moro Avila, a mustachioed part-time actor and motorcycle enthusiast, took the 
spotlight before a roomful of reporters to make his defense. Ochoa, or El 
Chocorrol, was the real assassin, he said, and was killed to keep him from 
talking. Officials also said El Chocorrol was the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
Moro Avila told reporters that Zorrilla ordered his underlings -- Jorge 
Maldonado, Raul Perez Carmona and Juventino Prado -- to commit the murder. On 
the day of the crime, Moro Avila said, he was having lunch at a restaurant when 
Prado called him over a police radio to go by motorcycle to the Zona Rosa. 
</P>
<P>
When he reached a downtown intersection, Moro Avila added, Carmona said to 
wait. A few minutes later he heard gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
But in a later statement, Moro Avila changed his story. He said he arrived 
after the murder had taken place and saw Buendia's body lying on the sidewalk. 
In both versions, El Chocorrol got on the back of Moro Avila's motorcycle and 
the two sped away. Moro Avila claims, however, that he did not know Ochoa was 
the murderer until after he was killed. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa "was not a friend of mine. I don't associate with dark-skinned people, 
only with fine people," Moro Avila said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Moro Avila's conflicting declarations, the government arrested 
Juventino Prado and Raul Perez Carmona, heads of the Mexico City Intelligence 
Directorate, and former security agents Sofia Naya, Jorge Lozada and Francisco 
Orozco. 
</P>
<P>
Zorrilla, like everybody else, denies involvement in the killing or a cover-up. 
It is not the first time, however, that officials have linked him to criminal 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
Police sources say that Zorrilla was on the payroll of Rafael Caro Quintero, 
the reputed drug lord who is in jail for the 1985 kidnaping and murder of the 
Guadalajara-based U.S. drug agent Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
At least half a dozen witnesses in Garcia Dominguez's official investigation of 
the Buendia case said Zorrilla received money and cars from Caro Quintero and 
payoffs from sub-commanders who worked for drug traffickers throughout Mexico. 
One police source said Caro Quintero admitted during interrogation that he paid 
Zorrilla $4 million a year for protection. 
</P>
<P>
Caro Quintero and his men also carried security police credentials signed by 
Zorrilla. Although investigators on the Camarena case saw the credentials, they 
later disappeared when the investigation was turned over to the Federal 
Security Directorate. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have long believed that security police were present during the 
interrogation and torture of Camarena. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Security Directorate, a secret intelligence agency, was used in the 
1970s to combat urban and rural guerrilla groups and was headed from 1977 to 
1982 by Miguel Nazar Haro. Nazar resigned from the post after he was indicted 
in San Diego in connection with a luxury car-theft ring. Some of the stolen 
vehicles turned up in the possession of security agents. Prado, Perez Carmona 
and two other police officials also were indicted in the San Diego case. 
</P>
<P>
Nazar Haro turned over command of the security directorate to Zorrilla. By 
then, the agency had a reputation of torturing political opponents and making 
them "disappear." 
</P>
<P>
"They controlled the state police, and the Federal Judicial Police was 
subservient to them. They came from the most powerful institution outside of 
the presidency -- the Interior Ministry," a police source said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe they were asked to do things they were later owed a favor for. The 
organization gained strength under Nazar Haro, and he continued to have a very 
close relationship with these people. It's a fraternity. There was some loyalty 
to Nazar Haro and some to the new man, Zorrilla." 
</P>
<P>
Zorrilla resigned his command in 1985 after the Camarena killing and news leaks 
of Zorrilla's alleged ties to drug traffickers. The police agency was disbanded 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
Nazar Haro turned up again this year as head of the newly created Intelligence 
Directorate. His appointment angered U.S. officials and caused such an uproar 
among human rights activists that he was forced to resign. Prado and Perez 
Carmona took his place. 
</P>
<P>
Once Prado and Perez Carmona were arrested, hundreds of other intelligence 
agents reportedly resigned or deserted the force. The agency was eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
But the intrigue continues. Garcia Dominguez announced last week that Zorrilla 
was responsible for another murder in 1985, that of Jose Luis Esqueda 
Gutierrez, who allegedly possessed evidence connecting Zorrilla to drug 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"The motive for taking the lives of Buendia and Esqueda Gutierrez was the 
knowledge they both had on Zorrilla's links to drug traffickers," Garcia 
Dominguez said. 
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor insisted the gunman who killed Buendia was not the dead 
Chocorrol, but Moro Avila, even though Moro Avila does not fit the sketch of 
the suspect drawn from witnesses' accounts. He said the evidence Zorrilla had 
removed from Buendia's office consisted of cassette recordings of two telephone 
conversations in which Buendia had advised Zorrilla of the information he had 
allegedly linking the police commander to traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
The Buendia case appeared solved, except that also last week, Mexican 
newspapers reported another murder. A jailed police officer, Abel Cuevas 
Uriostegui, was shot dead Wednesday night, allegedly as he led police to the 
houses of two former Federal Security Directorate agents -- the agents who 
supposedly were responsible for Esqueda Gutierrez's murder. 
</P>
<P>
This week, officials arrested another former commander of the Federal Security 
Directorate, Rafael Chao Lopez, who was second to Zorrilla. Chao was detained 
on charges of illicit enrichment that allegedly stemmed from drug and weapons 
trafficking.

19 SEIZED IN CLINIC PROTEST

Singing "Jesus Loves the Little Children," 19 demonstrators were arrested after 
blocking access to a private abortion clinic in Ventura. Organizers of the 
demonstration -- the first such protest in Ventura County -- said its timing 
was incidental to the U.S. Supreme Court decision this week allowing states to 
bar publicly funded abortions. "Our purpose is to lay our bodies down to rescue 
the babies scheduled to be murdered today," said Jill Craft, a spokeswoman for 
Operation Rescue. The demonstrators sat in the doorway and along the corridor 
outside Family Planning Associates Medical Group as employees of the private 
clinic were arriving for work. With the clinic effectively shut, patients and 
staff members milled around in the parking lot. Also held back were 10 clinic 
security guards, who were warned by police not to attempt to open the doors or 
escort patients inside for fear they might inflame the crowd. "This is 
Ventura," said Lt. Pat Rooney, "and we're going to keep the peace."

Latinos and blacks continue to suffer housing discrimination in the north and 
central Fresno areas, according to a study by the Community Housing Leadership 
Board. The board said half the property managers contacted during test visits 
by a dozen university students posing as renters displayed some form of unfair 
discrimination. Latinos and blacks often were quoted higher rents than whites 
and sometimes were told no apartments were available on the same day whites 
were told apartments were available, the board said.

A white man was convicted in a Sacramento Superior Court of murder and 
attempted murder in the racially motivated shootings of two elderly black men. 
Police say Ronald Z. Nesbitt, 35, opened fire from a car as the Rev. Sim Walton 
and Thomas Pruitt stood at a downtown Sacramento street corner on Oct. 13, 
1987. Walton, 72, pastor of the Mt. Calvary Missionary Baptist Church in 
suburban Del Paso Heights, died after being hit in the chest, stomach and head. 
Pruitt, 70, recovered after being grazed in the neck. Prosecutors and defense 
attorneys agreed that Nesbitt is mentally ill and that the rifle attack was 
racially motivated, but Supervising Deputy Dist. Atty. Dick Gilmour said he 
believed that Nesbitt acted with "cold, calculated judgment." The trial now 
enters a sanity phase.

A group of U.S. governors met with officials of the European Community in 
Belgium to learn how their states can gain from the trading bloc's plans to 
create a single market in late 1992. "We're out to find markets for goods and 
products that are produced in our respective states," said Virginia Gov. Gerald 
L. Baliles, chairman of the National Governors' Assn. "At the same time, we're 
interested in presenting our states as places to do business," he told 
reporters in Brussels. Baliles and the governors of Iowa, Washington, New 
Jersey, Utah, Vermont, Kentucky and Puerto Rico also held discussions with 
officials from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Former Kentucky Gov. John Y. Brown Jr. underwent quadruple-bypass heart surgery 
and was in critical condition in an intensive-care unit, said a spokeswoman at 
Humana Hospital Audubon in Louisville. Brown, 55, had been in good spirits 
Wednesday, the day before the surgery, and spent part of the day with his wife, 
former "CBS Morning News" host Phyllis George Brown, according to a statement 
released by hospital spokeswoman Denise Damron. Brown had undergone 
triple-bypass heart surgery in 1983 at the end of his four-year term as 
governor and developed serious lung complications. He withdrew from the 
senatorial race in 1984 because of health considerations.

Sudanese troops have arrested ousted Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi, an army 
spokesman announced. Col. Hassan Dahawy said that Mahdi was arrested at a 
friend's house in Khartoum, Sudan's capital, and taken to the armed forces 
general command headquarters. The 53-year-old Madhi, who had ruled since he was 
elected in May, 1986, was overthrown in a June 30 coup led by Lt. Gen. Omar 
Hassan Ahmed Bashir. Bashir has said that Madhi and politicians associated with 
his government will be tried before emergency tribunals. The new leader said 
his first priority for reform is fighting corruption.

Ireland's caretaker Prime Minister Charles Haughey, abandoning his resistance 
to a coalition government, began a week of talks with Desmond O' Malley, leader 
of the Progressive Democrats in an effort to form a new government. "A new 
political era is in sight," O' Malley told deputies in Parliament as his small 
center-right party began its battle for Cabinet seats alongside Haughey, whose 
Fianna Fail party has never shared power in its 63-year history. Parliament 
agreed to adjourn until next Wednesday when it hopes to pick a new prime 
minister and end a monthlong political crisis.

Two nuclear-capable Soviet warships and an oiler will dock July 21 at Atlantic 
Fleet headquarters in Norfolk, Va., marking the first time Soviet warships have 
visited a U.S. military port, the Navy said. The four-day visit by a Soviet 
destroyer and cruiser, both capable of firing nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, 
is part of a good-will exchange agreement in which U.S. warships will later 
visit a Soviet port. The schedule and details of the American visit were still 
being discussed, a Navy spokesman said. Arriving aboard the Soviet warships 
will be a small number of civilians and 1,100 Soviet naval personnel. The 
visiting ships will include the Slava-class guided-missile cruiser Marshal 
Ustinov and the Sovremenny-class destroyer Otlichnny.

DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIP ORDINANCE STALLS; 
</P>
<P>
CONSERVATIVE FOES FILE PETITION URGING VOTE TO BLOCK SAN FRANCISCO MEASURE 
</P>

A controversial ordinance recognizing domestic partnerships between homosexuals 
and other unmarried couples was stopped from going into effect Thursday by the 
demand of a conservative opposition group for a public vote on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
A minister and a rabbi representing the group submitted a petition at midday 
bearing what they said were more than the required 18,800 signatures needed to 
place the fate of the ordinance on the November ballot. In so doing, city 
officials said, the conservative group rendered the newly passed ordinance void 
until the matter is settled at the polls or the petition is successfully 
challenged. 
</P>
<P>
The move disappointed and outraged gays and human rights activists who had 
thought that the political fight had been won to legalize their relationships 
under the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's horrible," said Brett Averill, who had just picked up the 
application with partner Bill Weintraub when the suspension was announced about 
noon at the marriage license office in City Hall. The pair, who exchanged rings 
6 1/2 years ago, said they wanted to make a public declaration of their love. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel genuinely outraged by this," Weintraub added. "There is nothing to be 
gained from society by discouraging this sort of commitment." The pair said 
they will try to obtain a certificate, even though invalid, frame it and hang 
it on their wall until the fate of the ordinance is determined. 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub and Averill were one of about 15 couples who picked up applications 
for a domestic partners certificate since the application forms became 
available Wednesday, according to Assistant County Clerk LaVergne Keppard. But 
now, Keppard said, completed applications cannot be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, passed by a unanimous vote of the San Francisco Board of 
Supervisors on June 5, unmarried homosexual and heterosexual couples who live 
in "intimate and committed relationships" would be granted official city status 
that prohibits discrimination. The law would also give domestic partners some 
rights granted to married couples, such as hospital and jail visitation rights. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance had been hailed as insert,refer a victory by gay activists, who 
have been trying to enact the legislation since 1981. They have continually 
faced opposition from religious groups and conservatives who charge that the 
ordinance undermines family values. 
</P>
<P>
"To put any kind of relationship on the same level as traditional, time-honored 
marriage is an affront to the family," said Del McLaughlin, a member of the 
local chapter of the conservative group Eagle Forum and who helped gather 
signatures for the petition. "We just want to give the people of San Francisco 
a chance to voice their opposition about it." 
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin said a loose coalition of religious and conservative groups 
organized the referendum drive. The two clergymen who dropped off the petition 
at City Hall on Wednesday afternoon, the Rev. Charles McIlhenny of the First 
Orthodox Presbyterian Church and Rabbi Leonard Feldman, refused to speak to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Harris, aide to Supervisor Harry Britt, who authored the legislation, said 
she was not surprised that the ordinance was stalled but is confident that the 
measure will pass in November. Polls conducted by the supervisor's office and 
area newspapers after the measure passed found that 60% of San Franciscans 
supported the ordinance, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe what we need to do is to have it go on record that it's not just the 
mayor and the Board of Supervisors but the citizens at large who support this 
ordinance," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Harris said Britt might also challenge the petition's legality, based mostly on 
the validity of the petition's signatures. City officials will determine 
whether the petition has enough valid signatures sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
Harris and city Human Rights Commission member Larry Brinkin said they will 
begin planning a strategy to ensure that the legislation is enacted in 
November. Brinkin said an August meeting of gays and lesbians previously 
planned as a celebration of the domestic partners ordinance instead will be 
turned into a campaign strategy meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel angry . . . but I look forward to the opportunity to get the message 
out about what gay families are all about," Brinkin said.

GOVERNOR TO CUT BUDGET BY $646 MILLION, BUILD RESERVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS P. SHUIT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Following up on his promise to set aside more than $1 billion for emergencies, 
Gov. George Deukmejian announced Thursday that he plans to veto $646 million 
from the proposed $50-billion state budget. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the vetoes, Deukmejian told about 400 members of the Los Angeles World 
Affairs Council, the $49.3-billion budget will increase state spending by 8.7% 
during the fiscal year, which began July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he plans to veto $489 million in spending proposed by the 
Legislature just to bring the state's budget reserve back to $1.1 billion. The 
reserve was all but wiped out last year because of unexpected budget pressures. 
Deukmejian said he plans to veto another $157 million from the budget but will 
set that amount aside to restore legislative cuts to prison, tourism, new 
technology, and rural aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signing Today 
</P>
<P>
A list of the vetoes will be released when Deukmejian signs the budget today. 
Most of the cuts are expected to be in health and welfare programs. 
</P>
<P>
The governor appeared to be bracing for criticism over his vetoes. 
</P>
<P>
"Some will argue that I should have settled for a smaller reserve in order to 
fund all the vetoes. They will charge, as they have done every year, that it is 
somehow lacking in compassion to deny extra funds to the affected programs 
while stashing those funds away in reserve," the governor said in a luncheon 
speech at the Biltmore. 
</P>
<P>
But, Deukmejian argued, in past years the state has "needed virtually every 
dollar in the reserve in order to meet either unexpected expenses or 
unanticipated reductions in revenues." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Follow Through on Threat 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian indicated that he plans to follow through on a threat to 
substantially reduce the $36-million annual budget of the state Office of 
Family Planning, which administers programs providing birth control 
information, advice and other services aimed at eliminating unwanted 
pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
Birth control services have support among both Republican and Democratic 
legislators, but probably not enough to override the governor's veto. Veto 
overrides require support by two-thirds of the members of the Assembly and 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said he thinks family planning agencies can find revenue from other 
sources, such as private foundations and grants. The governor also indicated 
that he plans to cut money added to the budget by the Legislature for prenatal 
services for poor women. 
</P>
<P>
During the speech, Deukmejian appealed to members of the public affairs forum 
to support a proposed constitutional amendment in next June's primary election 
that will substantially rewrite two measures approved in earlier elections -- 
the government spending limit that was passed in 1979 and Proposition 98, the 
school funding initiative approved by voters last year. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said passage of the constitutional amendment is necessary so that he 
and the Legislature can go forward with plans to raise gasoline taxes and truck 
weight fees to finance a 10-year, $18.5-billion transportation program. The 
program calls for increasing the state gasoline tax by 9 cents a gallon, spread 
out over five years. 
</P>
<P>
During a question-and-answer session after the speech, Deukmejian, long an 
advocate of tough anti-crime legislation, lamented the fact that a series of 
new stringent sentencing laws has not stemmed the flow of illegal drugs into 
California. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not yet been successful -- despite all of the drug prevention and drug 
education programs that are undertaken -- to turn off a significant number of 
people from engaging in the use of illegal drugs," Deukmejian said.

GTE WORKERS THREATEN STRIKE AS TALKS BREAK OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH J. MANN, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As many as 15,000 GTE California employees are preparing to strike Monday if 
their demands for a salary hike and improved medical benefits are not met. 
</P>
<P>
A strike could affect 2.9 million telephone customers from Santa Barbara to San 
Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
After five months of negotiations, talks between GTE and the Communications 
Workers of America, the employees' union, broke off Wednesday afternoon, 
spokeswomen for both sides said Thursday. The two sides would not say how far 
apart they are. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a strike unless some kind of miracle happens between now and 
Monday," said union spokeswoman Gwend Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
If a strike does take place, GTE's 4,000 management employees will fill the 
positions of the striking workers, which range from directory assistance 
operators to customer representatives, GTE spokeswoman Ilona Smith said. GTE's 
customers will continue to receive telephone service during the strike, she 
said, but repairs and new telephone orders could be delayed a few days. 
</P>
<P>
"Our system is so highly automated it is not difficult to keep things operating 
during a strike," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of GTE's California customers live in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San 
Bernardino, Santa Barbara, Ventura and Imperial counties. 
</P>
<P>
Government mediators were called in several times during the negotiations, but 
both sides in the dispute said they could not agree on employee salaries and 
medical benefits. The previous contract expired in March, and negotiations have 
been continuing since then. 
</P>
<P>
GTE proposed an 8.79% salary increase spread over the next three years, Smith 
said. But last month the union rejected the offer by a 55% to 45% margin, 
Johnson said. The union contends that GTE offered only a 7.9% pay hike plus a 
lump sum payment. Johnson would not say what the union was asking. 
</P>
<P>
The union also voted down GTE's medical benefits package that, among other 
things, would increase some out-of-pocket expenses and the deductible employees 
must pay before their insurance coverage begins, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are angry," Johnson said. "Our employees have worked real hard to make the 
company profitable, but the company is not willing to share the profits and 
maintain the employees' standards of living." 
</P>
<P>
Smith countered that GTE's profits -- $342 million in 1988 -- were down $20 
million from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it is a fair and equitable offer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although both sides are gearing up for the strike, representatives say a 
resumption of negotiations before Monday is not out of the question.

EX-HUNGARIAN LEADER JANOS KADAR DEAD AT 77

<P>
Janos Kadar, who was installed by the Kremlin to suppress the Hungarian 
revolution in 1956 and presided over the Communist regime in Budapest for 32 
years, died Thursday at the age of 77. 
</P>
<P>
His death, in a Budapest hospital of pneumonia and the complications of old 
age, came 14 months after he was ousted as party leader and a few weeks after 
he was stripped of his last -- and largely ceremonial -- post as party 
president. His passing marks the end of a political era in Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
The rapid decline in Kadar's health coincided with a period of equally swift 
political change, which has seen the Kadar period come under increasingly harsh 
criticism as the country prepares for its first free parliamentary elections, 
likely to be held next spring. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Center of Nagy Controversy 
</P>
<P>
In a watershed event last month, former Premier Imre Nagy, who was executed as 
a traitor in 1958 for his actions during the revolution, was reburied as a 
national hero in a solemn daylong ceremony. It was Kadar, in charge of the 
country during the show trial that convicted Nagy, who approved the execution. 
</P>
<P>
The period following the revolution is described by most Hungarians as one of 
the darkest periods of the nation's history, and Kadar's name is indelibly 
linked with the trials and executions of hundreds of others who were convicted 
of "counterrevolutionary" activities for participating in the revolt, finally 
crushed in two days by a Soviet invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, however, Kadar's regime mellowed somewhat, and Hungary, under 
his leadership, was one of the first countries in the Soviet Bloc to take steps 
toward economic liberalization. Kadar was also far more tolerant of political 
dissent than the hard-line leaders who ruled neighboring Communist countries. 
</P>
<P>
With what could be regarded as some cleverness, he initiated some of the most 
significant changes at times when the leaders of the Soviet Union were largely 
preoccupied with upheavals in other sections of their East European empire. 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, when attention was focused on the turmoil in Czechoslovakia, Kadar 
introduced a plan that encouraged the development of cooperative enterprises, 
an initial step toward creating small private businesses, and urged Hungarians 
to take second jobs in the so-called second economy. 
</P>
<P>
And in 1980-81, when Soviet attention was fixed on the worsening crisis of the 
Solidarity movement in Poland, Kadar took further steps at economic 
liberalization. 
</P>
<P>
These moves were dubbed, with some derision, "goulash communism," but they 
presaged by more than 15 years some of the same economic reforms that would be 
initiated by Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Economic Innovations 
</P>
<P>
It was partly Kadar's economic innovations -- helped by foreign borrowing that 
has left Hungary with an $18-billion debt, the largest per capita in the Soviet 
Bloc -- that brought Hungary the highest standard of living in Communist 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
By the early 1980s, however, Hungary's economy began to run into problems, 
largely because of what many economists regarded as the irreconcilable conflict 
between Communist central planning and the steady pressure of an emerging 
free-market system. The result has been large price increases, inflation that 
has reached 18% and austerity measures. Increasingly, younger party leaders 
spoke of Kadar as an obstacle to continued change. 
</P>
<P>
Although criticism of the Kadar period -- particularly the early years of his 
regime -- had increased sharply in recent months, many Hungarian political 
figures credit Kadar's leadership with paving the way for the current crop of 
reformers who have risen to prominence in the Hungarian Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Kadar's tolerance of a certain level of dissent among opposition groups and 
within the party itself helped give rise to the forces that toppled him in May, 
1988, when Karoly Grosz, once regarded as a Kadar protege, orchestrated a 
special party conference, took over as party leader and shunted Kadar aside to 
the ceremonial role as party president. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Failing Health Cited 
</P>
<P>
In April, officials announced that failing health prevented Kadar from 
continuing in the job, and Grosz said in an interview afterward that the former 
leader was relieved because he was "sometimes not in control of his thoughts or 
his actions." 
</P>
<P>
Even as Grosz made those comments, his own leadership was under severe attack 
by party liberals, eager to show the party's commitment to reform before it is 
faced with the challenge of open elections next year. 
</P>
<P>
In a Central Committee meeting on June 24, Grosz found himself isolated as a 
centrist between party hard-liners and reformers. The reformers, with the 
numerical advantage and the Communist equivalent of "political momentum" on 
their side, elected veteran reform leader Reszo Nyers as party chairman. A 
four-man Presidium that includes Grosz, Nyers, Premier Miklos Nemeth and 
Minister of State Imre Pozsgay, will run the party. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever its immediate fortunes, the party today and the climate in which it 
exists is remote from the one Kadar inherited in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joined Party in 1932 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, his career was typical of figures who rose to prominence in the 
aftermath of the Stalinist period in Eastern Europe. He had joined the party in 
1931 and was jailed for three years for its illegal activities, but he was 
appointed to the party's Central Committee in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
After the war and the Communist takeover, he was interior minister -- and thus 
head of the police apparatus -- in the hard-line regime of Matyas Rakosi, who 
had him jailed in 1951 on charges of spying, treason and following the line of 
Josip Broz Tito, the Yugoslav leader who broke with Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
Kadar was released after two years, and when the Hungarian revolt broke out in 
October, 1956,Kadar was called on by the Soviets to take over the government 
from Imre Nagy, who held power for 13 days at the height of the revolt. 
</P>
<P>
Kadar's hand in the turmoil and violence surrounding the revolution has never 
been made clear, but it is generally thought that it was he who summoned the 
Soviet tanks into Budapest on Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the stain of the Nagy trial and execution for which many Hungarians 
have never been able to excuse Kadar, and the recent attacks on his rule as 
well as the ceremonial reburial of Nagy last month were said to have caused the 
former leader great pain. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview published earlier this year, Kadar seemed to acknowledge the 
public's view of him. 
</P>
<P>
"Nagy's tragedy is my own personal tragedy as well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Funeral services for Kadar are scheduled for July 13, after the conclusion of 
President Bush's visit to Hungary next week.

BOMB SUSPECT UNDER ARREST, BONN REVEALS

West German police revealed Thursday that they have arrested a Lebanese whom 
they suspect of planning to bomb American, Israeli and Jewish targets in the 
Federal Republic. 
</P>
<P>
The man, whom police did not identify, was said to be a 21-year-old physics 
student living in Darmstadt. He was described as a "fanatic" Shiite Muslim who 
may belong to the extremist Popular Front for the Liberation of 
Palestine-General Command. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was arrested in Munich, and a police official there, Erwin Hoesel, 
said papers in his apartment indicated that he planned to strike at U.S. 
civilian and military targets, at synagogues and at Israel's El Al airline and 
an Israeli trade center. 
</P>
<P>
According to Munich police, he was also planning a bomb attack on a 
discotheque, similar to an assault in West Berlin in April, 1986, which killed 
two U.S. servicemen and a Turkish woman and injured more than 200 people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arrested Last Month 
</P>
<P>
The suspect was apprehended June 22, police said. He was being interrogated 
secretly, but the investigation was disclosed Thursday by the Munich newspaper 
Sueddeutsche Zeitung. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that they intercepted a coded letter from the suspect mailed to 
Beirut in September, 1988, in which the student said he was willing to attack 
targets if he were supplied with weapons or explosives. 
</P>
<P>
Although he declined to identify the suspect, Hoesel, when asked if the student 
was working for a terrorist organization, said: "If I tell you he is a fanatic 
Shiite Muslim, that should give you an idea." 
</P>
<P>
The intercepted letter, Hoesel added, described Israeli and Jewish community 
buildings in Munich. 
</P>
<P>
"It was obvious they were targeted for attacks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the letter was in police possession for some time, they said it was 
only last month that they were able to identify and locate the author. 
</P>
<P>
"When his apartment was searched," said Hoesel, "further reports and documents 
were found, including several descriptions of U.S. military and civilian 
facilities, like discos and bars frequented by U.S. military personnel." 
</P>
<P>
West German police arrested 14 Palestinians last October and found devices that 
could be used to set off explosions in airliners. However, most of those 
suspects were released for lack of evidence, an action later criticized by U.S. 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
In December, a New York-bound Pan American World Airways flight was blown up 
over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 persons on board the plane and on the 
ground. The blast was attributed to a bomb placed aboard the jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said that terrorism is 
a major threat in West Germany and suggested that the Popular Front would try 
to carry out attacks in the Federal Republic.

IN BUDAPEST, KADAR'S PASSING STIRS UP RESENTMENT AND SORROW

<P>
In front of the neo-Gothic Parliament Building where Janos Kadar reigned as 
Hungary's leader for 32 years, a young art student struggled Thursday to 
express her mixed emotions about the death of the one-time Communist boss. 
</P>
<P>
"Kadar called in the Soviet army in '56, and I hate him for that," said Anna 
Lendyel, 22. "But it was a result of him that we could live a better life, and 
so I can feel some sorrow for him now." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout Budapest, black flags flew from government buildings Thursday to 
mark what Hungarian Premier Miklos Nemeth called "the end of an era." 
</P>
<P>
"Without Kadar, we could not have established the reforms," said the 
42-year-old reformist. 
</P>
<P>
The Kadar era was launched with great bloodshed in 1956 when Kadar helped the 
Kremlin squelch the Hungarian revolt. It was buoyed up when he introduced 
economic reforms in the late 1960s. And it was plagued by mounting inflation, 
plunging living standards and an increasingly disillusioned population when he 
inched toward senility and indecision in old age. 
</P>
<P>
Kadar was replaced as the Communist Party's general secretary by Karoly Grosz 
in May, 1988, and lost even the ceremonial title of party president several 
weeks ago. He spent his last months in a secluded villa outside Budapest, 
suffering from ailing health and increasing criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental Minister Laszlo Marothy, 42, a friend of Kadar's, said the former 
leader died a bitter man, unhappy with moves toward democracy that his 
successors have made and saddened by the personal attacks against him. 
</P>
<P>
But as many Hungarians noted with relish, the end of the Kadar era also marked 
the symbolic rebirth of his long-dead political rival, Imre Nagy, who was 
formally declared innocent Thursday by the Supreme Court, 31 years after he was 
hanged as a traitor for his actions during the Hungarian revolt. 
</P>
<P>
For many, it was poetic justice that Kadar, who collaborated with the Soviets 
to crush the 1956 uprising and ordered Nagy's execution after a show trial, 
should die on the same day that Nagy was exonerated by the highest court in the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
"Kadar died as a mass killer, and the Hungarian nation can't forget that," said 
Viktor Orban, a leader of the Young Democratic Federation, one of Hungary's 
most outspoken political groups. 
</P>
<P>
Orban incurred official wrath in Hungary last month when he gave a fiery speech 
at Nagy's ceremonial reburial in which he criticized the Hungarian Communist 
leadership and demanded that Soviet troops leave Hungary. The reburial of Nagy 
as a national hero on June 16 was televised nationally and attended by about 
100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary's newspapers, which criticized Kadar with increasing frequency in 
recent months, seemed to reconsider at his death. Although admitting that he 
made mistakes, they lauded him as a "good Communist," "a Hungarian patriot" and 
"the first reformer in Eastern Europe." 
</P>
<P>
At subway stations and street corners, passers-by snapped up copies of the 
afternoon papers, practically before vendors could bark out the headlines. The 
newspapers, with pictures of a beatific and dignified-looking Kadar, competed 
for space with books about Nagy, which were banned under Kadar but are now 
proliferating under the new press and political freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
Kadar also competed for news attention this week with President Bush, the 
latest face to break the covers of political weeklies. Hungarians are abuzz 
over the presidential visit next week, and a popular topic for conjecture in 
intellectual circles is what kind of financial aid package, if any, the 
President will announce during his visit. 
</P>
<P>
Kadar's funeral is scheduled for July 13, after Bush's departure, Nemeth said. 
Although it is unclear how extensive the funeral will be, the government 
predicts it will be well attended by Hungary's masses. Indeed, many young 
adults say they grew up believing that Kadar was a wise patriarch, a humble 
worker who gained the trust and support of people. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the children of the Kadar regime, and Kadar was my second father, an 
important personage for me," said Zoltan Lovas, a journalist. "It is popular 
now to criticize him, but the reality is that never in 500 years have we had 
the peace, stability and standard of living like in his regime."

ZHAO TIED TO 'CONSPIRACY'; CRACKDOWN DEFENDED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
China's leadership released a 25,000-word document Thursday, stating its case 
for last month's brutal army crackdown on the pro-democracy movement and 
linking ousted Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang and some of the country's most 
prominent intellectuals to a "political conspiracy" to overthrow the party's 
conservative leaders with help and financing from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The document asserted that Zhao "tolerated and connived" with the pro-democracy 
movement, which the party calls "a counterrevolutionary rebellion." It accused 
him of playing golf "as if nothing had happened" rather than attending a 
critical party meeting as protests grew into a nationwide movement in late 
April. It said that Zhao, once viewed by the outside world as China's most 
progressive champion of reform, refused to attend the key meeting in which 
paramount leader Deng Xiaoping issued the order to declare martial law in May. 
</P>
<P>
The report alleges that Zhao, who was later stripped of all his party 
positions, was responsible for refueling the protests with a speech he 
delivered when the movement was waning in early May. And it condemns by name 
nearly a dozen intellectuals -- several of them for the first time -- who were 
instrumental in shaping economic and political reform in China for the past 
eight years. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic analysts said the report strongly indicates that the party's ongoing 
purge of moderates will continue and broaden. 
</P>
<P>
Calling for a widening of the crackdown that Western diplomats and military 
experts say left at least 1,000 civilians dead and nearly 2,000 others in 
prison, the document said: "A handful of counterrevolutionary rioters refuse to 
recognize defeat and still indulge in sabotage, and even dream of staging a 
comeback. We should mobilize the people completely . . . and spare no effort to 
ferret (them) out." 
</P>
<P>
(A report in the July 2 edition of the Sichuan Daily, received in Beijing on 
Thursday, said two more people have been sentenced to death for offenses during 
rioting in the southwestern city of Chengdu on June 5 that followed the Beijing 
violence. The report did not say whether the sentences had been carried out. 
Authorities have reported a total of 27 people executed for their part in the 
demonstrations.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trying to 'Pin It All on Zhao' 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats and other analysts here said the report on the protests was based 
largely on partial truths -- "a heavily edited historical account," one said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is very definitely an attempt to pin it all on Zhao and his circle of 
intellectuals," one Asian diplomat said. "It is also the leadership's 
definitive attempt at defending themselves, and they've done it beautifully." 
</P>
<P>
The report, delivered by Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong to the Standing Committee of 
the National People's Congress, China's nominal legislature, on June 30 but not 
made public until Thursday, was unanimously approved Thursday afternoon on the 
final day of a special session. 
</P>
<P>
The legislators also approved a new law that restricts future street 
demonstrations in Beijing and adopted a resolution expressing "strong 
indignation" over U.S. economic sanctions imposed against China in response to 
the army crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
The People's Daily newspaper, meanwhile, assailed the June 29 vote in the House 
of Representatives in favor of further sanctions against Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"To those people in the American Congress who deliberately distort the facts 
and interfere with China's internal affairs, we cannot but express our 
indignation," the Communist Party newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
Another official condemnation of the United States came Thursday from the 
Foreign Ministry in a formal response to Monday's protest by the U.S. Embassy, 
charging that Chinese troops deliberately fired into the apartments of American 
and other Western diplomats three days after the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
The ministry called the June 7 shooting, in which Western experts say soldiers 
fired hundreds of shots into the Beijing apartment building, "an act of 
self-defense," adding that the U.S. allegation of a "premeditated" attack was 
"a sheer fabrication." 
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the protest, the ministry repeated its charge that the U.S. Embassy 
has committed "gross violation of the norms of international law" by giving 
refuge to dissident astrophysicist Fang Lizhi and his wife. Fang was cited and 
extensively quoted half a dozen times in the party's report on the months 
leading up to the protest movement and the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the report -- selective in key parts and exhaustive in 
others -- is testimony to the efficiency of China's Public Security Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Details of Private Meetings 
</P>
<P>
It gives page after page of details of basement meetings held by Fang and other 
dissident intellectuals and of campus meetings of student leaders. Its 
narrations are filled with direct quotations from protest leaders' "private" 
meetings on Tian An Men Square, which became the heart of the pro-democracy 
demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
The report quotes Zhao directly during a private meeting with two personal 
advisers, depicting him as ordering that the state-run media be allowed to 
report the protests in full. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no big risk to open up a bit by reporting the demonstrations and 
increasing the openness of news," Zhao was quoted as telling former Communist 
Party Central Committee member Hu Qili on May 6. 
</P>
<P>
The day after that meeting, the report said, Hu, who was also later stripped of 
his party posts, personally conveyed orders for openness to a meeting of the 
official media's top editors. The party's report said that ensuing coverage of 
the demonstrations, with party print and broadcast media reporting the protests 
and displaying photographs and film of banners calling for Deng and other aging 
hard-liners to step down, brought hundreds of thousands of people from all 
walks of life into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"For a time, it looked as if refusal to join in the demonstrations meant 
'unpatriotic,' " Mayor Chen's report stated. "(The) demonstrations threw social 
order in Beijing into a mess and seriously disrupted the Sino-Soviet summit, 
which was closely followed worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
The party's report then charged that Zhao had "used the opportunity of meeting 
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev on May 16, deliberately directing the fire 
of criticism at Comrade Deng Xiaoping and making the situation even worse." 
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Zhao told Gorbachev that Deng was still in control of 
China, despite the fact that the 84-year-old leader had given up all his posts 
except the chairmanship of the party's powerful Central Military Commission, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The following day, the report stated, the protest leaders launched "their most 
furious and vicious" attacks on the party leadership, raising banners that 
declared, "There is still an emperor in China" and condemning Deng as "a 
senile, fatuous autocrat." 
</P>
<P>
"Slogans like 'Support Zhao Ziyang,' 'Long Live Zhao Ziyang' and 'Zhao Ziyang 
be promoted chairman of the Central Military Commission' could be seen and 
heard in the demonstrations and at Tian An Men Square," the report said. 
"Plotters of the turmoil attempted to use the chaos as an opportunity to seize 
power. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation in Beijing became increasingly serious, with anarchism viciously 
spreading and many areas sinking into complete chaos and white terror." 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats, journalists and Western expatriates in Beijing at the time flatly 
disagree with that interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'People Were Happy' 
</P>
<P>
"There was no terror," one diplomat said. "The people were happy. There was 
elation. The People's Daily even ran an editorial reporting on the 'new spring' 
that had dawned in Beijing." 
</P>
<P>
Another Western diplomat said, "The one thing this report never deals with is 
the simple question of why there was so much popular support for Zhao, for a 
freer press and for political reforms and why Deng was so universally 
unpopular." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the report, the party keeps returning to its major themes: that a 
movement to bring down the party was hatched months, even years ago, that it 
was organized and directed by "a tiny handful" of "counterrevolutionaries," 
that it received thousands and perhaps millions of dollars in aid from 
sympathetic donors in Hong Kong, Taiwan and the United States, and that it had 
grown so large and had so deeply split the party that the leadership was left 
with no alternative but to order the military to use lethal force. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, the party document says Zhao had an "unshirkable responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
The report then details how Zhao's personal secretary, Bao Tong, used a key 
party think tank -- now known to be a center for Zhao's reformists -- to leak 
advance word of martial law to the students in the square. The report says the 
students thus "gained time to organize people and coerce those who were in the 
dark to set up roadblocks at major crossroads to stop the advance of troops." 
</P>
<P>
In the days thereafter, the report alleges, pro-democracy organizers used their 
"strong financial backing" to hire thugs and ex-convicts to attack the troops, 
purchase weapons and attempt to solicit defections from the army. 
</P>
<P>
"During the whole operation (of clearing the square), no one, including the 
students who refused but were forced to leave, died," the report asserted in a 
conclusion disputed by many eyewitnesses, who said they saw tanks rolling over 
students and soldiers shooting unarmed civilians.

WALESA SAYS HE WANTS TO MEET WITH GORBACHEV IMMEDIATELY

Lech Walesa, leader of the East Bloc's first legal democratic opposition in 
more than 40 years, said Thursday that he wants an immediate meeting with 
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"I would go immediately," he said in a newspaper interview one day after 
Gorbachev said in Paris that he saw no obstacle to a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa did not explain why he wants to meet Gorbachev in the brief interview 
with the Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza. But he has indicated for months 
that he wants to reassure the Soviet Union about Poland's radical democratic 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to go there to agitate or irritate but to seek understanding for 
the Polish reforms . . . in a way that will not be suggestive or stir things 
up," the Solidarity leader said in April. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Kremlin Favors Visit 
</P>
<P>
Senior Solidarity sources say that the Kremlin has been in favor of a Walesa 
visit for some time but that it has been delayed by leaders of the Polish 
Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
His remarks in April appeared designed to reassure Moscow following a 
government-Solidarity pact on legalizing the free trade union and allowing the 
opposition into Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Next Tuesday, Walesa will host a lunch at his home for President Bush, who will 
be visiting Poland to support democratic change in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa's latest proposal came immediately after Solidarity took its seats in 
Parliament and as it was trying to block the election of Communist leader Gen. 
Wojciech Jaruzelski as president while signaling its interest in forming a 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Jaruzelski on Thursday repeated his refusal to run despite intense pressure 
from his party and reports from party sources that all but one of the 173 
Communist bloc parliamentary deputies had now endorsed his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
A surprise statement by the official news agency PAP published Thursday said it 
was authorized to announce that "no new facts or circumstances have taken place 
that could cause Wojciech Jaruzelski to change his stand on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa simultaneously repeated his own interest in the presidency, even though 
he has said he is not running. 
</P>
<P>
"I still uphold that," he told Gazeta Wyborcza. "But you know, there are some 
things that are outside our control. So there is no absolute certainty that 
something will not change at the last moment."

BUSH BACKS EAST BLOC REFORM, SEES NO U.S. ROLE 
</P>

<P>
President Bush, offering a preview of his visit next week to Poland and 
Hungary, declared Thursday that he would stress his "strong support for the 
democratic course these nations have chosen" but would avoid raising tensions 
or driving a wedge between the Soviet Union and its allies. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the two Eastern European nations that have displayed the strongest 
democratic tendencies, Bush asserted at an afternoon press conference, "Their 
efforts are not only a new beginning in their own countries but can be the 
beginning of an historic process of European reconciliation, of ending the 
artificial division of Europe." 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he vowed to refrain from "dictating to and fine-tuning the 
political processes of these countries." 
</P>
<P>
Huge crowds are expected to greet Bush in both countries, and some U.S. and 
European officials are concerned that if demonstrations become disorderly, 
government forces might be used to suppress them. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a pervasive fear of this in many quarters in Europe," said a U.S. 
intelligence analyst. "And the China syndrome -- the specter of repression in 
China -- adds to the fear." 
</P>
<P>
Intelligence sources also warn that Bush's visit could unleash anti-Soviet 
sentiments in both Poland and Hungary, despite the high regard that the people 
there hold for reforms initiated by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"Anti-Soviet feelings have never been higher," said one source. "They're in 
full bloom in Poland and Hungary." 
</P>
<P>
The sources did not rule out the possibility that Communist Party hard-liners 
in the two countries might resort to repressive measures if, as one put it, 
enthusiasm for change "gets out of hand and becomes a spontaneous combustion." 
The fact that Soviet troops crushed an uprising in Hungary in 1956 and a reform 
movement in Czechoslovakia in 1968 is also adding to the uneasiness in Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
On other subjects at his press conference, Bush said he is "happy" that Oliver 
L. North, who drew a suspended sentence and a $150,000 fine for his conviction 
in the Iran-Contra case, was not given a jail sentence. But Bush declined to 
discuss whether he would consider pardoning North or make any other comment 
while the conviction is under appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The President also announced that the U.S. government is canceling hundreds of 
millions of dollars in debt owed it by poor sub-Saharan African countries. The 
debt involves development loans under various federal aid programs, and U.S. 
officials said it could total as much as $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In his press conference, held mostly for foreign journalists, and later at a 
symposium on Eastern Europe at the White House, the President talked 
enthusiastically about prospects for democratic reform not only in Poland and 
Hungary but throughout Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"These are historic times," he told the symposium. "And what's at stake is not 
just movement towards economic and political liberalization in Poland and 
Hungary, but the prospect of ending the post-war division of Europe. And Poland 
and Hungary, yes, they're leading the way; but they face enormous economic and 
political problems, and they need our support in their efforts if they're to 
succeed." 
</P>
<P>
Asked at his press conference whether conditions are right to improve relations 
with East Germany, Bush said he would insist on "a little more democracy, a 
little more freedom, a little more openness." He said he would tell the East 
Germans: 
</P>
<P>
"Come along with the flow. Things are changing in Eastern Europe; don't be 
lagging behind. Get out front. Don't be afraid of democracy and freedom. It 
isn't going to hurt anybody. Indeed, it's going to help your people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unperturbed by Gorbachev 
</P>
<P>
The President appeared unperturbed that Gorbachev, visiting Paris, had 
dismissed his recent call for a withdrawal of troops from Poland as unhelpful 
and as "propaganda." 
</P>
<P>
He said he was not trying to make things more difficult for Gorbachev, "just as 
when he goes to France and Germany I don't think he's trying to make things 
more difficult for the United States." 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a very interesting period of change," Bush said. "And I have said I 
want to see perestroika (restructuring) succeed and I want to see glasnost 
(openness) succeed, and I'll repeat it here. And my trip over there is not to 
try to -- through that statement or anything else -- drive wedges between the 
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. That's not what 1989 diplomacy is about." 
</P>
<P>
The President, whose European trip will take him to Paris for the July 14-16 
economic summit of the seven leading industrialized nations, said he expects 
the summit to be "fairly general" in how it exhorts the Eastern European 
countries to implement democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
He said the allies should express their concerns about human rights violations 
and emigration restrictions in the Soviet Bloc. But he cautioned that they 
should stop short of telling Eastern Europe "how the political process works," 
because they can't agree on that point themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said U.S. efforts at the Paris summit will be just as important as his 
visits to Eastern Europe in helping end the economic and political division of 
Europe. "That's why I will propose ways to work together to assist economic 
recovery and democratic change in Poland and Hungary," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The key U.S. economic objective at the Paris summit, Bush said, will be to 
sustain non-inflationary growth in the seven summit countries -- the United 
States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy.

MARGARET NELSON; NORWALK'S FIRST WOMAN MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Margaret I. (Peg) Nelson, the first woman elected to the Norwalk City Council 
who also was that city's first woman mayor, died Wednesday of complications 
after a heart attack. She was 64. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Nelson, who used a wheelchair after suffering a stroke in 1984, had just 
recently returned home after being hospitalized for injuries suffered in a Jan. 
27 auto accident, said Norwalk spokeswoman Heather Morris. 
</P>
<P>
She was taken Wednesday morning from her Norwalk home to Coast Plaza Medical 
Center, where doctors pronounced her dead. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Nelson was a member of the City Council from 1976 to 1988 and served each 
of her four-year terms with the honorary title of mayor. She opted not to seek 
reelection last year. 
</P>
<P>
It was her volunteer work with several groups and organizations, including the 
Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District, that she said led to her seeking 
office. 
</P>
<P>
In lieu of cards or flowers, her family asked for donations to the Norwalk 
All-City Youth Band. 
</P>
<P>
There will be no funeral services. 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by her husband Lee, 65; three children, and five grandchildren.

ROBERT R. BURNETT; PARTNER IN LAND DEVELOPMENT FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A memorial service was held Wednesday at the Pacific Palisades Presbyterian 
Church for Robert R. Burnett, partner in the real estate development firm that 
formed the 110-acre Los Angeles Corporate Center in Monterey Park and 4 million 
square feet of other office, commercial and industrial property in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Burnett was 46 when he died June 28 in Los Angeles of a degenerative liver 
ailment. 
</P>
<P>
With founder Edward C. Ellis and partner Mark Sloan, the firm of Ellis Sloan 
Burnett Properties developed the Monterey Park acreage that is corporate home 
to AT&amp;T Communications, Southern Pacific Transportation Co., Southern 
California Gas Co., General Electric Medical Systems and others. 
</P>
<P>
The company also developed Ontario Airport Business Park, Industry Business 
Center, Mission Oaks Business Park, Baldwin Business Park, Bixby Business Park 
and more. 
</P>
<P>
Burnett, who earned his architecture degree at USC, became a firm partner in 
1983. His area of expertise was urban land economics. He formerly was with 
Kaiser Engineering in Oakland and was community planner for the UC San Diego 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
Later he worked as an independent consultant in Los Angeles and San Francisco 
before joining Ellis Sloan Burnett. 
</P>
<P>
He was a founding donor of the Museum of Contemporary Art and a patron of the 
USC Friends of Fine Arts. Donations in his name are asked to the American Liver 
Foundation.

Bowing to state demands, Exxon agreed Thursday to submit to a state of Alaska 
inquiry over the destruction of computer records in the nation's worst oil 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
"They have indicated they were willing to cooperate in such an investigation," 
said Alaska Atty. Gen. Doug Baily. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon, in statements from Houston, declared that no spill documents were 
destroyed, only computer copies. The same statement made no mention of Alaska 
demands that Exxon submit to an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
But Baily announced Thursday afternoon that lawyers for both sides were meeting 
in Anchorage to work out an agreement that would allow the state to get sworn 
testimony from Exxon officials within two weeks.

Exxon missed a deadline Thursday to agree to a state of Alaska probe into the 
destruction of computer records in the nation's worst oil spill, but company 
officials said no relevant documents were lost. 
</P>
<P>
Alaska Atty. Gen. Doug Baily demanded a full inquiry into the destruction of 
documents and vowed to take Exxon to court if it refused to let state lawyers 
question Exxon employees in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
A company statement in Houston sought to reassure the state that no critical 
documents were lost -- without mentioning the state's request to quiz some 
Exxon employees under oath. 
</P>
<P>
An Exxon computer technician, Kenneth Davis, complained that the company had 
taken no steps to preserve spill documents that may prove instrumental in 
court.

OIL SPILL OFF ALASKA CONTINUES TO DISRUPT SALMON FISHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Drew Sparlin has been spending his days in a 40-foot boat on the choppy waters 
of Cook Inlet, doing something hundreds of other commercial fishermen in this 
part of Alaska can only think about this year. 
</P>
<P>
He's been fishing. 
</P>
<P>
Sparlin's boat, the Lady Lee, is one of a half-dozen vessels leaving the 
fishing port of Kenai every day in search of migrating salmon -- and globs of 
floating oil -- as part of a test to see how much oil is in the fishing grounds 
of Central Cook Inlet. 
</P>
<P>
Until this week, Sparlin had found only fish. But that changed Wednesday 
afternoon, when he discovered a series of foamy, rust-brown streaks of floating 
oil in an area scheduled to be opened for fishing later in the week. As a 
result, another salmon opening was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Spill Causes Havoc 
</P>
<P>
More than three months after the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William 
Sound, causing the biggest oil spill in the nation's history, oil in Alaska 
waters continues to cause havoc in the state's billion-dollar salmon fishery. 
</P>
<P>
The first two weeks in July would normally be the peak period for commercial 
fishing in dozens of areas along the south central Alaska coastline. Five 
different species of salmon migrate by the millions from the Pacific Ocean to 
the freshwater streams of their birth, and the bays and passages of Prince 
William Sound, Kodiak Island, Cook Inlet and the Alaska Peninsula are normally 
filled with fishing vessels and floating processing ships. 
</P>
<P>
But because of lingering oil, only a few of the fishing grounds in this part of 
Alaska have been opened this summer by state fishing authorities. Others have 
either been closed for the season or indefinitely delayed. The places range 
from bays in Prince William Sound where oil still coats the beaches to remote 
regions as far as 500 miles away where wisps of oily sheen have been seen. 
</P>
<P>
There have been no reports of oil contaminated fish. Oil floats and fish swim 
beneath the surface of the water, avoiding it. Yet state officials and the 
fishing industry, fearing that even the hint of oiled salmon will taint 
Alaska's reputation for pristine-quality seafood, have instituted a so-called 
"zero-tolerance" policy, banning all fishing in places where even small amounts 
of oil are detected. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Find Streaks, Tar Balls 
</P>
<P>
What he and others have found, more than 200 miles from where the tanker 
grounded, has not been huge amounts of pollution. Instead, they have found 
occasional foamy streaks of emulsified oil known as mousse, and hard, black tar 
balls that have evolved from the crude oil that spilled March 24. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all so scattered you can't go out and pick it up or skim it up," said 
Sparlin, who has fished for salmon and herring for 24 years. "People don't know 
what to do. In this district alone there's 600 boats. You've got a couple 
thousand people, just right here, sitting and doing nothing. No one knows what 
to expect . . . everybody's disgusted." 
</P>
<P>
The Exxon spill came at a time when record salmon catches were expected in many 
places. In areas beyond the oil's reach, such as Bristol Bay or in southeast 
Alaska, fishing has been stronger than ever this year, and fish from those 
areas are being airlifted by the ton to canneries in this region. No one is 
sure how much of the season can be salvaged in the areas affected by oil, but 
hopes are growing dimmer as the days pass and new seasons are delayed. 
</P>
<P>
In Kodiak, 250 miles south of Prince William Sound, hundreds of boats are 
docked in the harbor, their crews awaiting the latest word on which areas will 
be opened. Earlier this week, only three of 52 fishing districts were open 
there. Fishermen are afraid to leave town because of the possibility of a 
sudden opening, but there has been little fishing since the first closure a 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
"You see people walking around kind of going crazy" said Rhonda Ellingson, 
whose husband, Rick, began netting salmon off southern Kodiak Island last week 
after a three-week delay. "There's nothing to do. You're supposed to be out 
fishing making money, and instead they're living on a tied-up seine boat with 
five other guys and not knowing when they're going out." 
</P>
<P>
Exxon has agreed to pay fishermen for any documented losses. And some of them 
have gone on the Exxon payroll, renting out their boats for shore clean-up 
jobs, or like Sparlin, participating in test fisheries with state biologists 
and Exxon claims adjusters on board. But many fishermen are skeptical that 
Exxon will pay the full amount of their losses. In Cook Inlet, fishermen 
grumble that they are still awaiting settlements from a smaller tanker spill 
two summers ago.

SENATE PASSES MOTORCYCLE HELMET BILL LIKE ONE DEUKMEJIAN VETOED 
</P>

<P>
The Senate on Thursday approved a virtual carbon copy of a bill vetoed last 
year by Gov. George Deukmejian to require that all motorcycle riders and their 
passengers wear safety helmets. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation by Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson) was passed on a 
24-10 vote and returned to the Assembly for concurrence in Senate amendments. 
The bill cleared the lower chamber last spring with no votes to spare. 
</P>
<P>
"Given that the bill is essentially the same as last year's and the same set of 
circumstances exist, if the bill reaches the governor, the same result will 
ensue," warned Tom Beermann, Deukmejian's deputy press secretary. "He will veto 
the measure." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian Veto 
</P>
<P>
Last year marked the first time in more than two decades of trying to enact a 
mandatory helmet law that the Legislature passed the measure. Deukmejian 
refused to sign it, saying he would only support the helmet requirement for 
motorcyclists 21 years of age and younger. 
</P>
<P>
A separate bill supported by Deukmejian to beef up motorcycle safety and 
training contained a provision requiring 16- to 21-year-old motorcyclists to 
wear helmets. But that feature was struck from the measure last March. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, none of the estimated 822,000 licensed motorcycle drivers in 
California are required to wear protective headgear, although passengers 15 1/2 
and younger must do so. However, for the last year and a half, motorcyclists 
under 18 have had to complete a training program before receiving a motorcycle 
operator's license. 
</P>
<P>
Foes of the mandatory helmet proposal, including the Hells Angels and other 
motorcycle organizations, have successfully fought the bill since 1967. 
Government, they argue, has no business interfering with their "freedom of 
choice" to wear a crash helmet or not. 
</P>
<P>
But their argument has been co-opted by helmet supporters and given a new spin. 
The supporters argue that taxpayers who must pay the substantial medical, 
hospital and other public assistance costs of injured motorcyclists have been 
denied a choice. They say tax dollars could be better spent on other 
health-related matters. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) said safety helmets could save taxpayers 
several million dollars a year. He said the costs to taxpayers of even a single 
helmetless motorcycle crash victim without insurance can exceed $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changed Mind 
</P>
<P>
Torres drew support Thursday from Republican Assemblywoman Rebecca Morgan of 
Los Altos Hills, who said the measure "flies in the face of my basic philosophy 
of keeping government out of our lives." 
</P>
<P>
But she said that after viewing motorcycle crash victims in hospitals she had 
concluded that "these are individuals who have not taken responsibility for 
their own lives and have put the responsibility on taxpayers -- you and me." 
</P>
<P>
However, an opponent of the bill, Sen. Don Rogers (R-Bakersfield), said wearing 
a safety helmet may create a "placebo effect" in which a cyclist might drive 
faster and take unnecessary risks because he falsely believes he is protected 
against injury. 
</P>
<P>
"Wearing a helmet may work against their safety," he said.

ROSENFIELD HITS NO-FAULT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harvey Rosenfield, chairman of Voter Revolt, sponsor of Proposition 103, said 
Thursday that if a new no-fault insurance initiative is placed on the 
California ballot next year, he may sponsor an initiative "to establish a 
publicly run, nonprofit corporation to offer auto insurance in California on an 
exclusive basis." 
</P>
<P>
"If the insurers refuse to obey the will of the public, if they refuse to 
cooperate but instead choose the path of confrontation, they will lose the 
privilege of serving California consumers altogether," said Rosenfield, who 
explained that the initiative would bar private auto insurers from the 
California market. 
</P>
<P>
He issued his statement in response to a report in Thursday's Times quoting 
Allstate Insurance Co. officials as saying that they may join in a coalition 
with consumers and minority groups to promote a no-frills, no-fault automobile 
insurance proposal on the 1990 ballot, if the California Legislature refuses to 
act to establish one this year. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield, whose organization is closely aligned with trial lawyers in 
opposing no-fault and defending the present system of litigating many accident 
claims, castigated Allstate for "suggesting it is ready to push another 
no-fault initiative, just seven months after voters rejected such an approach 
(in 1988) by overwhelming margins." 
</P>
<P>
Four Canadian provinces have government auto insurance, but no American state 
has such a system.

SANDIEGO AT LARGE: GUNTHER WILL BE GONE, BUT HE WON'T BE REPLACED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When famed animal trainer Gunther Gebel-Williams appeared in San Diego for the 
first time in July, 1969, Eric Beheim was there. 
</P>
<P>
When Gunther (nobody calls him Gebel-Williams) begins his final San Diego 
appearance on Tuesday, Beheim will be there. It's a job (he's a saxophonist), 
but it's also a devotion. 
</P>
<P>
"I started going to circuses when I was 6 years old in Cleveland, and I haven't 
stopped," said Beheim, 43. He's a musician who lives in Lakeside and joins the 
circus orchestra every summer when it plays San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"Once Gunther is retired, people will start bragging that they actually saw him 
perform," Beheim said. "It'll be like old-timers today who saw the legendary 
Clyde Beatty or Frank Buck." 
</P>
<P>
After 20 years as the star of Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, 
the 54-year-old Gunther has announced plans to retire after a farewell tour 
with the circus, which arrives Tuesday at the Sports Arena for a six-day run. 
</P>
<P>
Beheim remembers Gunther wowing the crowd in 1969 as he was propelled from a 
teeter board onto the back of an elephant. He remembers in the 1970s watching 
in an empty arena as Gunther trained a rare and temperamental white tiger 
between shows. 
</P>
<P>
He remembers one night when Gunther's finale -- riding a tiger atop an elephant 
-- culminated right next to the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"I looked up at the tiger, and he looked back down at me, right in my eyes," 
Beheim said. 
</P>
<P>
On this tour, Gunther's closer involves simultaneous control of three rings of 
animals -- Siberian and Bengal tigers in one, elephants in a second, and 
Lipizzaner horses in a third. 
</P>
<P>
"They may find someone to succeed Gunther, but not to replace him," Beheim 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Amazing and Sticky

Facts that will dazzle your friends:

* The Del Mar Smurfs chewed 234 feet of Bubble Tape bubble gum while beating 
teams from Temecula, Poway and Vista to win the Vista Little League tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Amurol Products Co. of Naperville, Ill., makers of Bubble Tape, had heard that 
the Smurfs were partial to the chewy stuff and rushed a case to Del Mar in time 
for the tourney. It comes in skinny rolls 6 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
* Syndicated columnist Bob Greene says Pete Rose speaks with an Ohio accent, 
"the prettiest accent on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
But Times reporter Barry Horstman, like Rose, a native of Cincinnati, says that 
isn't so. He says Rose talks more like people who live across the Ohio River in 
Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
How does he explain that? Kentucky is where the race track is, Horstman notes. 
</P>
<P>
* The San Diego Libertarian Club, long accused of harboring a far-out 
philosophy, will erase all doubt at Tuesday's meeting.

</P>
<P>
How Times Change 
</P>
<P>
That was then, this is now. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson has come to San Diego twice to take a bow for the 
renovation of the downtown Sandford Hotel: last October when he was seeking 
reelection and this week as he warms up to run for governor. 
</P>
<P>
Senior housing is a major political issue, and Wilson after all was helpful in 
shifting $500,000 in federal funds to the project. The rest of the $6.5 million 
came mostly from two nonprofit 
</P>
<P>
organizations run by Mavoureen O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony Wednesday night, Wilson cut a ribbon and praised O'Connor as "the 
Houdini of those who make housing happen." The smell of irony was in the air. 
</P>
<P>
When Wilson was the all-powerful mayor of San Diego, O'Connor was rebuffed in 
her bid for an appointment to the Housing Commission. Her ideas on how to 
finance low-income housing were seen as too unconventional. 
</P>
<P>
No More X-Rated Jogging 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know, but I've been told. . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Trainees in the Marine Corps drill instructor school sometimes run in 
formation along the shore in Mission Beach and Pacific Beach, red shorts, 
T-shirts, combat boots, DI school flag held proudly aloft. 
</P>
<P>
So it was Wednesday afternoon. Sunbathers stopped, looked and listened. What 
they heard was surprising to some. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Corps says it won't happen again. Next time the DIs jog in public, 
there will be no X-rated singing in cadence.

SUIT ATTACKS 'BUFFER ZONE' AT BATIQUITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE WOLF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carlsbad's best-known environmental activist has thrown down the gauntlet to 
the City Council with a lawsuit challenging the council's decision to permit a 
housing development to creep closer to the edge of Batiquitos Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
Dolores Welty, a persistent and vocal opponent of the Sammis Properties 
development on the northern side of the lagoon, has taken issue with the 
45-foot "buffer zone" established between the pink Mediterranean-style homes 
and the edge of the bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is clearly too late to push back the 70 houses already built on the 
site, Welty is hoping to stop would-be residents from building back-yard decks, 
spas and barbecues that would encroach on the edge of the cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Didn't Prepare EIR 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed Monday in Vista Superior Court, seeks to set aside an 
ordinance approved by the Carlsbad City Council one month ago, which permits 
construction of "accessory structures" within the buffer zone. The suit also 
contends that the city violated the California Environmental Quality Act by not 
preparing an environmental impact report before approving the amendment to the 
development's master plan. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obvious to anyone that 45 feet is not a good buffer as it is," Welty 
said. "It's not enough to protect the bluff or to protect the lagoon 
creatures." 
</P>
<P>
Although Welty recognizes that her lawsuit will not stop further construction, 
she hopes to make the city toe the line by preparing the report. "It may be 
that an EIR will show that (allowing construction in the buffer zone) has no 
impact on the lagoon," she said. "But this EIR still has to be made, by law." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the city attorney's office said Thursday that the city had 
not yet received notice of the lawsuit. Phil Carter, assistant to the city 
manager, said the city will have no comment before the lawsuit is reviewed by 
the city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Welty's assault on the 168-acre project, formally known as the Batiquitos 
Lagoon Educational Park, is not likely to halt it but may slow it. The City 
Council is scheduled to address the project at its Tuesday meeting and decide 
whether to grant developer Don Sammis an extension on the three-year limit he 
was given to lure a major university to the site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Elite University Planned 
</P>
<P>
Sammis' project, as approved by the council in 1985, calls for an elite 
graduate university, surrounded by research-and-development facilities, an 
Olympic training site and a residential area catering to professors and 
students. One section of luxury homes has already been constructed, but the 
rest of the project was put on hold because of Sammis' failure to produce proof 
that an educational institution will in fact be built. 
</P>
<P>
Although the three-year limit expired last fall, the city planning department 
has recommended that the council grant Sammis a five-year extension to come up 
with a university. "We really don't have anything to lose by giving him an 
opportunity to live up to his commitments," said associate planner Christopher 
De Cerbo ( on Thursday. "It's time, but it's no loss to us. It's his money." 
</P>
<P>
One of the proposed conditions of an extension, however, is that the next set 
of 28 homes be built at least 80 to 100 feet back from the bluffs facing the 
lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
But Welty does not feel that pushing back the rest of the buildings will make 
up for the damage already done. "It's not a trade," she said, adding that she 
will pursue the lawsuit even if the city requires a larger setback in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the city is considering such a requirement, though, "is very 
promising," she said. "It's a recognition of the planning error in the first 
place." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not blaming them -- it's an error we all made," Welty said. "It's hard to 
imagine beforehand what the project will look like." 
</P>
<P>
Welty's attorney, Roger Jon Diamond, said there is no restraining order 
preventing the City Council from pushing forward with plans for the development 
while the lawsuit is pending. "But I would think, as a practical matter, they 
would want to wait," he said. A court hearing is scheduled for July 26. 
</P>
<P>
Carlsbad Mayor Bud Lewis and City Atty. Vince Biondo were unavailable for 
comment Thursday, as were developer Sammis and his attorney.

RUFFO RODE CHARISMA TO HISTORIC BAJA VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TIJUANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A seemingly easygoing, informal politician with a surprisingly soft voice, 
Ernesto Ruffo Appel hardly seems the type to make electoral history. But Ruffo 
now stands poised to be Mexico's first modern-day opposition governor, having 
apparently handily defeated the ruling-party candidate in Sunday's elections in 
Baja California. 
</P>
<P>
If his victory is confirmed this Sunday, when the votes will be counted, it 
will mark the zenith of a heady three-year political career. Already, there is 
talk of a presidential candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Ruffo was an executive of an Ensenada seafood-processing firm when he 
was hand-picked by business interests to represent the right-of-center, 
pro-business National Action Party, known as the PAN, in the city's mayoral 
elections. He had never run for office before, but he says he had been a 
long-time sympathizer of the PAN, an opposition party for 50 years. He 
reportedly stood vigil for the PAN at voting booths during the 1980 elections. 
</P>
<P>
Ruffo's opponent in the mayoral race was an unpopular, little-known and aloof 
candidate imposed by the leadership of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, known as the PRI. Ruffo, by contrast, was well-known and personable. He 
has lived most of his life in Ensenada, a port city of more than 200,000 
residents about 70 miles south of Tijuana, and had held posts in a number of 
seafood-industry trade groups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Triumph of Personalities 
</P>
<P>
He won the mayoral race by a wide margin. Most observers said it was a triumph 
of personalities rather than politics. Ruffo's political rhetoric tends to 
focus more on the need for change in Mexico than on any specific political 
programs of the PAN. 
</P>
<P>
Ruffo's informal, open-shirt style -- seemingly embodying the easy-going pace 
prevalent in Ensenada -- -- appealed to voters long accustomed to the 
often-studied formalism of PRI leaders. He often wears jeans and seldom dons a 
tie. Working in his favor was his position as an underdog in an area eager for 
change -- a theme often exploited by Ruffo. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to explain Ruffo's success, analysts inevitably refer to his pleasant 
personality and widespread voter discontent with the ruling party. "Everyone 
seems to like Ruffo, regardless of what his party stands for," noted Jose Luis 
Perez Canchola, a social scientist allied with leftist parties here. "He seems 
to have a certain charisma." 
</P>
<P>
At rallies, Ruffo, a round-faced, curly-haired man with an ample midriff, seems 
comfortable dancing to music, kissing babies and women and embracing male 
colleagues. His speeches lack the punch of his presence, but no one appears to 
mind. He has a clear populist appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Ruffo's three-year term as mayor of Ensenada was a stormy one. He charged that 
the PRI-dominated state government withheld municipal funds, forcing him to cut 
back services and lay off hundreds of workers, mostly belonging to unions 
affiliated with the PRI. The workers held vigils outside of City Hall, calling 
the maverick mayor incompetent and unable to manage a budget. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ruffo acknowledged that he lacked experience in government and 
that he may have made mistakes, but he charged that political manipulation was 
behind the city's fiscal crisis. "Everyone understands that this problem, at 
its root, is political," the then-embattled mayor declared. 
</P>
<P>
Soon, after sanitation workers also had to be laid off, Ruffo took to the 
streets to personally help in a massive cleanup. It was yet another publicity 
coup for a mayor who always seemed receptive to journalists, from both Mexico 
and the United States. The state government and Ruffo finally reached an 
accord, and many workers were rehired, diffusing the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Successfully Battled System 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Ruffo emerged as a successful battler of the system, a little guy 
who made good against the behemoth that is the PRI. His gubernatorial campaign 
slogan and anthem -- "Si, se puede" -- is roughly translated as, "Yes, we can 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
"The Mexico we are living in now is a new Mexico," Ruffo said in an interview 
several years ago. "The PRI is not accustomed to living with competition. So, 
of course, they resist change. . . . The PRI has to learn to live with the new 
reality. If they don't, they are going to lose their position very rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
Ruffo, who turned 37 last month, was born in San Diego, as were many other Baja 
California residents whose parents could afford the superior medical care 
available north of the border. In nationalistic Mexico, his birthplace has 
frequently been used against him, as has his affiliation with a party often 
viewed as pro-Yanqui. At one point, a move was afoot in the state legislature 
to pass a law requiring that only Mexican-born citizens could become governors. 
</P>
<P>
Ruffo has confronted the issue of his birth head-on. At age 18, he says he 
freely chose Mexican citizenship over the benefits of a U.S. passport. He notes 
that he served in the Mexican military, rising to the rank of sergeant in an 
infantry brigade. His campaign rallies often end with the singing of the 
national anthem. The candidate of the party with the blue-and-white banner 
sports a Mexican tricolor on his lapel. 
</P>
<P>
Reared comfortably in a small-town atmosphere in Ensenada, Ruffo graduated in 
1975 with a degree in business administration from the Technical Institute of 
Monterrey, in the northern state of Nuevo Leon. The school is a hotbed of young 
PAN activists and a favorite destination for the sons and daughters of wealthy 
Mexican industrialists, particularly from the north. After graduating, he 
returned to Ensenada and entered the business world, becoming chief of 
personnel in 1976 at Pesquera Zapata, a giant seafood-processing company 
jointly owned by Mexican and U.S. investors. 
</P>
<P>
While a politician from the highly nationalistic PRI may have been embarrassed 
about working for a firm with U.S. ties, Ruffo was unapologetic. Also, in 
contrast to PRI office-holders, he is not hesitant to speak English, of which 
he has some command, to U.S. groups or interviewers. (Even PRI officials 
schooled extensively in the United States are unlikely to speak English 
publicly, lest they be perceived as somehow unpatriotic or unduly 
pro-American.) 
</P>
<P>
During his term in Ensenada, Ruffo often insisted that he was not interested in 
becoming governor. But his growing popularity meant that his candidacy was a 
practical certainty by the time he announced his entry into the race some 
months ago. PRI strategists conceded that he would be a difficult candidate to 
defeat, despite the massive party apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
His campaign program speaks of rooting out corruption, encouraging foreign and 
domestic investment, pumping government money into delivery of water, pavement 
and other services. All are themes also enunciated by the PRI. How exactly a 
Ruffo administration plans to finance all its expensive plans remains a 
mystery, but, right now, the voters don't seem to be asking. 
</P>
<P>
"With the people united," he told a rally in Tijuana Tuesday evening, "we all 
know that, Yes, we can do it!"

DEVELOPER REQUIRED POLITICAL GIFTS FROM ITS SUBCONTRACTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A prominent San Fernando Valley development company has required its 
subcontractors to make political contributions as a condition of doing business 
with it, a highly unusual and, some critics say, unethical practice. 
</P>
<P>
Lycon Group of Sherman Oaks, one of Southern California's largest apartment 
builders, has written a "contribution schedule" into its contracts for 
subcontractors. The schedule required payments of $50 to $25,000, depending on 
the size of the job, according to a Lycon Group contract obtained by The Times 
and interviews with subcontractors. 
</P>
<P>
Lycon Group deducted the contributions from its payments to subcontractors and 
apparently deposited the money in an account for a political action committee 
the company created two years ago. So far, the committee has paid out just a 
fraction of the funds it has raised, with the money going to two Los Angeles 
city councilmen and a state legislator, according to campaign disclosure 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
Lycon Group officials refused to comment on the practice. The firm is the 22nd 
largest developer in Southern California, according to a 1989 Los Angeles Times 
survey, with a reported $146 million in residential sales. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous campaign law experts and officials with the California Building 
Industry expressed surprise when told of the firm's arrangement. One building 
industry representative called it innovative and a subcontractor who favored 
the practice said it "is good for the industry." 
</P>
<P>
Others said the practice was coercive, and several subcontractors questioned 
whether it was ethical. 
</P>
<P>
"Their lawyers will say that I didn't have to sign the contract, and no one put 
a gun to my head," said Andrew Cooper, owner of a Burbank concrete company, who 
has stopped doing business with Lycon Group after two years in part because of 
the PAC donation requirement. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's hard to turn down so much business when you have workers to keep 
employed and payroll to meet. I'm not proud of the fact I acceded to this," 
Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Josephson, a consultant to Mayor Tom Bradley's recently appointed city 
ethics panel, said Lycon Group's method "is in effect coercing people to be 
involved in a political process that ought to be entirely and totally 
voluntary." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Uncharted Fields' 
</P>
<P>
"If it is legal, there will be nothing to stop it from proliferating," said 
Josephson, president of the Joseph and Edna Josephson Institute, a nonprofit 
government ethics center based in Marina del Rey. "These guys have founded 
uncharted fields. Obviously they are being very up front about it, and that is 
worthy of some degree of credit. But you can still be very open and very 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The Lycon PAC registered in May, 1987, as a statewide organization to give 
money to "candidates and ballot measures that support real estate and 
construction industries," according to campaign disclosure statements. 
Subcontractors said in interviews that the contribution requirement began at 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Lycon PAC contribution schedule, a subcontractor hired for a 
job that paid $5,001 to $10,000 had to contribute $50, one who got a job for 
$10,001 to $20,000 had to pay $150 and so on. On the high end, a contract for 
$2 million required a contribution of $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
"From a legal standpoint, the question that would interest me is whether this 
is a ruse," said Daniel Lowenstein, a professor of election law at UCLA and 
former chairman of the Fair Political Practices Commission. "I would assume 
that the subcontractors add the contribution to their bill. So really it may 
just be a way for the developer to contribute to his own PAC in the name of all 
those other people. It does raise questions. It may not be a bona fide PAC." 
</P>
<P>
Several contractors said they simply increased the costs of their bids to cover 
the contributions. Lycon Group's method of collecting was to then withhold the 
contribution from the company's payment to contractors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Legal Opinion 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the state Fair Political Practices Commission and the Los 
Angeles city attorney's office said they could not give a legal opinion on 
Lycon Group's policy without conducting a detailed review. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for the FPPC, said the Lycon Group's practice 
does not appear to violate the state Political Reform Act. "There isn't 
anything in the act that governs the conditions of obtaining contributions," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Michael Woo, chairman of the City Council's Governmental 
Operations Committee, which is considering a number of ethics reforms for city 
government policies, said he would be concerned if the practice became 
widespread. 
</P>
<P>
"It is commonplace for developers to make informal verbal requests and that 
does not tend to be as onerous," Woo said. "But I would not want to see this 
become part of the everyday work environment. It's already probably a serious 
problem that developers feel they have to be active with campaign contributions 
to process politically sensitive projects. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned that the web of political contribution involvement may spread 
beyond the developers and become mandatory for subcontractors who are seeking 
to work in the city of L.A." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Money Not Spent 
</P>
<P>
The latest Lycon PAC campaign disclosure statement showed a balance of $130,653 
as of Dec. 31, 1988. Listed as contributors were businesses associated with 
construction, such as roofing, masonry, plastering and painting. 
</P>
<P>
The Lycon PAC has contributed $6,500 to candidates since the organization was 
established, records show. The largest beneficiary was Woo, who received $4,000 
from the Lycon PAC in 1987 to retire a campaign debt. Woo said this week that 
he was not aware of the company's method of raising funds when the donation was 
made. 
</P>
<P>
The other Lycon PAC recipients were City Councilman Marvin Braude, who received 
$500 in 1987 and Assemblywoman Marian La Follette (R-Northridge), who received 
$2,000 in 1988. Donations since Dec. 31 will appear on the group's next 
disclosure statement, which is to be filed by July 31. 
</P>
<P>
Don V. Collin, chief attorney for the California Building Industry Assn., a 
lobbying organization for developers statewide, said he had "never heard" of a 
developer contractually requiring subcontractors to make political 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
"I would prefer to call this innovative . . . and have no opinion on the legal 
ramifications," Collin said. "When a builder forms a PAC they usually have a 
function and peddle tickets to the sub-trades and suppliers -- golf tournaments 
tend to be the ones I hear about most often." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PAC Supporters 
</P>
<P>
Some subcontractors, however, welcome the Lycon Group's arrangement and view it 
as a convenient way to contribute to an organization that supports politicians 
who further the interests of the building industries. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say this is a good cause," said Eric Shemp, whose Northridge firm, ECS 
Plastering, donated $1,000 to the Lycon PAC in 1988. "They want to keep 
building and keep the economy strong and that's what I want, too. That is what 
feeds my family." 
</P>
<P>
Dale Francescon, of Westlake Village, the treasurer of the Lycon PAC and a 
Lycon Group officer, as well as the two other officials named as "authorized 
officers" on the firm's contract agreement, did not return repeated phone calls 
from The Times or respond to messages left at their homes or offices over a 
six-day period. The two others are William S. Lyons Jr. of Hidden Hills and 
Robert J. Francescon of Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
In May, Los Angeles City Clerk Elias Martinez began auditing thousands of 
dollars in political donations from officers, employees and family members of 
law firms and large development companies, including the Lycon Group, to 
determine whether the multiple contributions violated city law. Martinez said 
Thursday that the audit is not completed. 
</P>
<P>
A Times computer study of political contributions to city officials by the 
Lycon Group shows that the firm's officers, the officers' family members and 
the Lycon PAC have donated about $27,000 to Woo, Braude and City Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky since September, 1987.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW SPRAYING STARTS FOR ORIENTAL FRUIT 
FLIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Oriental fruit flies have been trapped in West Covina, the second finding 
of the fruit-destroying pest in Los Angeles County within the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural officials this week began applying an insecticide to fences, trees 
and utility poles in a 13-square-mile area bounded by Valley Boulevard on the 
south, Citrus Avenue and Pierre Road on the east, Vine Avenue on the north and 
Walnut Avenue on the west. The area includes portions of La Puente, Walnut and 
West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
The fly was successfully eradicated by the same measures last year after being 
detected in four different parts of the county, said E. Leon Spaugy, Los 
Angeles County's agricultural commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Additional traps have been placed with daily inspections to determine how 
widespread the infestation might be. Two Oriental fruit flies also were found 
June 22 and June 24 in Hawthorne and Lawndale.

HUNTER NO. 2 AT J. DAVID, MITROVICH SAYS ON STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Club President George Mitrovich, who was director of public affairs at the 
now-defunct J. David &amp; Co., testified Thursday in the fraud trial of Nancy 
Hoover Hunter, describing her as "the second most important person in the 
company." 
</P>
<P>
Mitrovich said he was hired by Hunter and Jerry Dominelli in 1981 but continued 
to work for charitable causes, several of which eventually received substantial 
contributions from J. David. 
</P>
<P>
However, Mitrovich testified that he had very little contact with the business 
operations, although his brother and three friends invested with J. David &amp; 
Co. after discussing with him the investment house's "general appearance of 
success." 
</P>
<P>
Mitrovich, testifying as a prosecution witness in the 234-count trial in U.S. 
District Judge Earl B. Gilliam's courtroom, said Hunter was a busy worker and 
other employees had to exert a great deal of effort to get her attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Hoover spent a great deal of time on the phone," he said. "People were 
constantly vying for her attention." 
</P>
<P>
Mitrovich said he took several trips paid for by J. David, which he assumed 
were one of the trappings of a successful firm. He and his family also lived in 
a house provided by J. David &amp; Co., which was the site of "lots and lots of 
City Club events." 
</P>
<P>
Mitrovich testified about the final days of the investment house, including a 
phone call he received from a protege at J. David. 
</P>
<P>
"He said some very strange things were going on, and that he was bringing 
cashier's checks to investors and picking up bounced checks," Mitrovich said, 
adding that this "stunning news" led him to meet with Dominelli and Hunter -- 
and that Dominelli assured him that the problem was caused by funds being 
contained in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Mitrovich soon resigned from the company, which had fallen into "the most 
chaotic situation I have ever been exposed to." 
</P>
<P>
Under cross-examination by defense attorney Richard Marmaro, Mitrovich said 
Hunter was not a detail-oriented person and was easily distracted, partially 
because she had become involved in too many outside enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Part of Mitrovich's testimony touched on his long-standing acquaintanceship 
with Hunter and caused Hunter to cry gently as he detailed the collapse of J. 
David &amp; Co.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SLUMLORD WON'T PAY PENALTY IN JAIL TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Pedro slumlord who was late in paying $16,000 to help his tenants 
relocate will not have to spend extra time in jail for his tardiness, a San 
Pedro Municipal Court judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Roy Ferkich on Wednesday declined a prosecutor's request that he lengthen 
the sentence of landlord Martin Canter, whom health inspectors said operated a 
rat- and cockroach-infested apartment with a leaky roof and faulty wiring. 
</P>
<P>
The judge told Canter in March that he would have to serve only 45 days of a 
six-month sentence if he sold his building and paid his tenants' relocation 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
Canter promised four tenants $4,000 each if they agreed to move out in March, 
but it was not until a sentencing hearing June 27 that the landlord's lawyer 
turned over a check. When the check bounced, Judge Ferkich said he would 
consider ordering a longer jail sentence for Canter. 
</P>
<P>
A second check delivered Monday was covered by sufficient funds, tenants' 
lawyer David Salisbury of the Legal Aid Foundation of Long Beach told the judge 
on Wednesday.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN WOULD REQUIRE ADDRESSES ON ROOF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to the fire that destroyed the Pan Pacific Auditorium, the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors has directed county attorneys to prepare an 
ordinance that would require all high-rise buildings three stories and taller 
to have their address on the roof. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who introduced the motion Wednesday, said the May 
24 fire on the city's Westside "pointed out the need to improve our ability to 
fully respond to major emergencies." 
</P>
<P>
"The Fire Department had a great deal of difficulty in locating key buildings 
in the area because there were no addresses visible to the aerial units," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich called the roof identification measure "an inexpensive requirement 
that will substantially enhance our ability to protect lives and property."

BRADLEY OUTLINES ATTACKS ON CRIME, STREET CONGESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sounding as much like an upstart campaigner as a newly inaugurated fifth-term 
incumbent, Mayor Tom Bradley on Thursday unveiled sweeping remedies for the 
city's crime-ridden public housing projects, courted support for a stalled 
traffic initiative and laid plans to announce a proposal to revitalize one of 
Los Angeles' most troubled neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
In a City Hall press conference, Bradley, "declaring war" on drugs and violence 
at the city's 21 housing projects, proposed a comprehensive, seven-point plan 
to increase security and social services for the Housing Authority's 31,000 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
After making the announcement, Bradley raced to a hearing by the executive 
board of the Southern California Assn. of Governments (SCAG), where he sought 
and won support for his plan to ban 70% of truck traffic from city streets 
during rush hours. The SCAG vote by itself will not implement the program, but 
it presented the mayor with an important ally on an issue to be heard later 
this month before the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sets Press Conference 
</P>
<P>
The mayor also scheduled a press conference for today to announce what aides 
described as yet another "sweeping proposal," this one aimed at revitalizing 
South-Central Los Angeles. Details were not available, but the mayor is 
expected to announce formation of a task force to promote economic development 
in the neighborhood, improve housing, expand job training programs and increase 
services for senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
A press aide promised that the mayor will make the announcement on a "decaying, 
grafitti-covered street corner, which symbolizes the charge of the task force." 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is one of many mentioned last week by Bradley in his inaugural 
address, in which he promised to make Los Angeles a more livable city. 
</P>
<P>
In part, an aide said, that means limiting growth in those neighborhoods that 
are choked with congestion and funneling development to those areas that have 
yet to enjoy the booming economy of the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Facing Investigations 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's vigor seemed intended to serve notice that he is still in control 
of City Hall, even as he faces investigations into his personal finances and 
business dealings. The city attorney, the city controller and the federal 
Securities and Exchange Commission are conducting separate inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been busy, and we will stay busy," said Deputy Mayor Mike Gage, who has 
complained about the political paralysis the multiple inquiries have created 
for the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
The housing proposal, which does not require council approval, attempts to link 
some existing city programs in a concerted effort, allocate more personnel for 
others and launch new partnerships with the Police Department and schools. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed are more city police officers to supplement the existing 48-member 
housing authority police staff, a bolstering of the housing authority's legal 
staff that handles evictions of drug dealers, and the establishment of six 
pilot "service centers" to offer job training and placement. 
</P>
<P>
"Tenants need not be economic hostages, forced by poverty to live amidst 
violence and drug abuse," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
In one of his few appearances before SCAG in several years, Bradley outlined 
his partial truck-ban proposal and fielded questions from representatives of 
other area cities which suffer the same traffic congestion as Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The 20-member executive committee of SCAG, an alliance of various government 
agencies throughout the region, has no jurisdictional authority, but is 
influential in the setting of public policy. 
</P>
<P>
The board quickly voted unanimously to endorse the Bradley plan, which would 
require trucking companies to reduce their deliveries during the heavy commute 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal is to be brought before the council later this month.

RANCHO SANTA FE PAIR ARRESTED, ACCUSED OF MASSIVE BANKRUPTCY FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE FRITSCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A couple who allegedly moved hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of 
furniture, wine, furs and other property from their Virginia home to a rented 
house in Rancho Santa Fe have been arrested on charges of attempting to defraud 
the bankruptcy court in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Thursday that David and Annette DeFusco, who have been living 
in the exclusive North County community since they fled Virginia last April, 
were being held in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in San Diego pending a 
bail hearing today. 
</P>
<P>
They also face mail fraud charges in Texas in connection with their direct-mail 
solicitation business, which purportedly made false promises of expensive gifts 
such as automobiles and gold bullion to prospective buyers of time-share 
resorts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Awakened by FBI 
</P>
<P>
The high-living pair was arrested Wednesday morning by FBI agents, who awakened 
them and took them away in handcuffs, according to Assistant U.S. Atty. Cynthia 
Bashant. In California, the DeFuscos alternately have been using three last 
names, Brown, Hagen and Stone, Bashant said. 
</P>
<P>
Annette DeFusco, 28, wept openly when she was taken into court Wednesday, 
Bashant said. U.S. Magistrate Irma Gonzalez ordered her and her 34-year-old 
husband held without bond until today's full detention hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The DeFuscos have pleaded not guilty to the Texas charges and were free on 
$50,000 bond in that case, but were arrested on new charges filed Monday by 
federal prosecutors in Alexandria, who also obtained a search warrant for their 
home in Rancho Santa Fe, Bashant confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
The new complaint charges that the DeFuscos illegally concealed expensive 
assets from the bankruptcy court in Alexandria and shipped them out of the 
state under assumed names. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charged With Lying 
</P>
<P>
The DeFuscos are also charged with lying to the bankruptcy court, Bashant said. 
They allegedly had told the court that they had never before filed for 
bankruptcy, when they had done so at least twice under different names and in 
different places, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors will seek permission from a magistrate in San Diego to remove the 
couple to Virginia to face the charges that they violated bankruptcy laws for 
personal gain, Bashant said. They also are under investigation for running a 
mail-solicitation scheme in the state of Washington, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple were paid by companies that ran time-share resorts for each person 
who responded to a solicitation. Because the DeFuscos promised potential buyers 
expensive gifts, they were able to deliver a high volume of responses, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
The DeFuscos, who ran their direct-mail business from offices in Manassas Park, 
Va., filed for bankruptcy in 1987 and owe creditors $1.3 million, according to 
bankruptcy court filings. The Washington Post reported that the DeFuscos are 
indebted to almost 100 Washington-area merchants who supplied them with 
everything from the stationery they used in their mailings to the $102,000 
Rolls-Royce automobile they drove between their Great Falls home and their 
Fauquier County farm. The figures are contained in their 13-volume filing in 
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Alexandria, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cars Valued at $257,000 
</P>
<P>
Their cars alone were valued in 1987 at $257,500, according to bankruptcy 
affidavits, including one Mercedes-Benz registered to Annette with the Virginia 
license plate "EVIL ONE," the Post said. Despite the bankruptcy filing, they 
continued to spend lavishly, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Henry E. Hudson, the U.S. attorney in Alexandria, as 
saying the DeFuscos masterminded "one of the most aggravated cases of 
bankruptcy fraud that I have ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, FBI agents seized dozens of expensive items from their house in 
Rancho Santa Fe, including a wine collection insured for $50,000, a coin 
collection, an Audi automobile, "lots of jewelry," at least 10 furs, leather 
furniture and marble bookcases, according to Bashant. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
From Virginia 
</P>
<P>
Most or all of the items were believed to be from the DeFuscos' Virginia home, 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to reach the DeFuscos' San Diego attorney, Michael Littman, were 
unsuccessful Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In the Texas case, which is scheduled for trial next month, more than 2,000 
written consumer complaints have been collected by the prosecutor, who alleges 
that the DeFuscos' mailings promised recipients gifts such as BMWs and gold 
bullion but actually delivered dime-store products such as bathtub bubble 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
The assets seized Wednesday could be used to pay off creditors in the 
bankruptcy, prosecutors said.

How predictable. How utterly old hat. As if following carefully drawn 
blueprints, the weekend weather is going to do exactly what it is supposed to 
do for mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
Muggy and warm are the weather watchwords for San Diego's second weekend in 
July. Near-seasonal temperatures will seem higher because of moist winds slowly 
creeping in from Mexico, the National Weather Service reported. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thunderstorms Possible 
</P>
<P>
A humidity level of 30% may bring thunderstorms by Sunday to such areas as 
Ramona, Alpine and Campo, forecaster Wilbur Shigehara said. However, the rest 
of the county should experience a typical July. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, it doesn't look like it will rain over the city, but it will be 
noticeably more humid," Shigehara said. "We have a real change with the winds 
coming from Mexico. Earlier this week, we were getting winds from the drier 
directions, Hawaii and Japan, but the winds are now subtly shifting." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
68 to 72 at the Beach 
</P>
<P>
After the morning low clouds burn off, highs at the beach are expected to range 
from 68 to 72. Afternoon skies should be hazy but fair, Shigehara said, adding 
that skies along the coast and inland will also be hazy to fair, with some 
straggling clouds from the south. Highs along the coast throughout the weekend 
will be from 71 to 81, with minor day-to-day fluctuation, according to the 
forecast. Overnight lows of 56 to 62 are predicted along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
The surf is at 3 feet. The ocean is 66 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Inland temperatures will be slightly higher, ranging from 81 to 91 during the 
days and 56 to 62 at night. 
</P>
<P>
Mountain highs will be between 85 and 92, with overnight lows in the middle 
60s. Desert highs will range from 107 to 113, and overnight lows will be 77 to 
85.

DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: CHEF WALLY BACK IN THE GAME; 
</P>
<P>
MENU TOUTS OLD FRIENDS AT NEW BISTRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Chef Ernest Wally finally has opened his own restaurant, Chef Wally's Bistro, 
in the Sports Arena-area premises that formerly housed the likable Cafe 
Chanticleer. 
</P>
<P>
The menu bills the place as serving "coastal cuisine," a term at once 
expressive and vague. But, true to form, Wally has made room for some of his 
old friends, including alligator, wild boar and venison. This is reminiscent of 
the mid-1980's, when he donned the chef's tall toque at the now-defunct 
Judson's in Loma Portal, where rattlesnakes slithered across his appetizer 
list, buffalo roamed among the entrees, and lions and bears (no tigers, though) 
prowled through the nightly specials. 
</P>
<P>
Every chef dreams of having his own establishment, and, although Wally really 
belongs downtown (he also was chef for a time at the Ida Bailey dining room at 
the Horton Grand Hotel), he seems intent to do his best -- which can be quite 
impressive -- in this shopping center location. To find a menu and wine list of 
this scale in a neighborhood place is to find a luxury that San Diego could use 
more of. The tone taken by the cooking seems at odds with the rather kitschy 
decor that Wally inherited from Cafe Chanticleer, but time doubtless will bring 
a more contemporary look to the dining room. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Order Ahead by Fax 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant unquestionably is up-to-date on one rather odd point. Patrons 
who wish to fax orders ahead may do so, a service that might become commonplace 
over time. The menu suggests an intriguing possibility by encouraging 
first-time diners to also fax an identification photo. "We will be able to 
recognize you when you arrive," it reads. "That should impress your friends." 
</P>
<P>
Although he has trimmed down to a mere 265 pounds, the still bear-like Wally is 
not one to pussyfoot around the kitchen. There is a sophistication and subtlety 
to his cooking, but he definitely likes strong, direct flavors. For example, a 
potent red bell pepper puree laces the unctuous corn chowder, cayenne heats the 
"sambal" rice served with some entrees and poached pear garnishes are spiced -- 
most exotically and most deliciously -- with cardamom. 
</P>
<P>
Wally's insistence upon definite flavors extends to such details as the small 
dish of pesto that arrives with the sourdough bread and makes a good 
alternative to butter. This gesture is double-edged, though, because the intent 
here is not merely gustatory, but health-conscious; Wally, to a degree, watches 
his customers' cholesterol counts for them, and even makes his hollandaise 
sauce with egg substitute. It is surprisingly good, by the way, and virtually 
indistinguishable from the genuine article based on the lavish use of egg 
yolks. 
</P>
<P>
Some dishes twist classic recipes into new shapes, while others seem strictly 
Wally's own. The appetizer list, in addition to sampler plates of grilled 
alligator, wild boar and venison, offers that old standby, stuffed mushrooms. 
These could be said to be new and improved, though, because Wally uses fragrant 
shiitake mushrooms, crams them with a sherry-spiked melange of shrimp, scallops 
and Dungeness crab, and tops them not with the usual grated cheese, but with 
hollandaise -- which is altogether nicer. 
</P>
<P>
Meals include the choice of salad or one of the soups of the day. The soups 
recently have included an unusual, creamed seafood gumbo that seemed a cross 
between a bisque and a chowder, and a deeply toned French onion. Salads consist 
of jumbles of luxury greens, such as radicchio, oak leaf and limestone 
lettuces, served with a trio of homemade dressings on the side. The walnut oil 
vinaigrette is nicely herbal and the hot bacon dressing is sweet-sour and 
richly indulgent, but the red Roquefort seems in flavor rather too close to 
bottled, commercial French dressing to be enjoyable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Game, Other Entrees 
</P>
<P>
Game, in larger portions of the dishes mentioned on the appetizer list, 
reappears among the entrees, where it gets a good deal of competition from a 
long list of fish and shellfish and some very handsomely done meat dishes. The 
lamb loin was especially impressive, the meat nicely crusted but also quite 
rosy, and the accompanying blackberry sauce based on brown sauce enriched with 
only a little fruit puree. The result was savory rather than sweet, which is 
exactly as it should have been. 
</P>
<P>
A well-balanced mustard sauce moistened grilled pork tenderloin medallions, and 
was creamed just enough to suggest richness; the same remark applies to the 
particularly savory porcini mushroom sauce that lapped a mound of tender 
sweetbreads. Wally's own hollandaise brought a unifying richness to the house 
version of veal Oscar, here called simply veal scaloppine, which teamed 
butter-crisped veal slices with lumps of fresh crab meat and tender-crisp 
asparagus spears. 
</P>
<P>
A similar dish appears on the fish list, this time announced by name as 
swordfish Oscar. To make the preparation a tad unusual, Wally garnishes it with 
Peruvian blue potatoes. Rather further afield is grilled swordfish in a 
gingered garlic sauce, which sounds quite nice, and grilled sea scallops in a 
lovely, pungent cream sauce; these were garnished with cardamom-scented pears, 
a clever and beautiful addition to the plate. Both Norwegian salmon and 
Hawaiian ahi are served with black peppercorn sauces, which is unusual but well 
within the range of the possible, especially with the ahi, which Wally 
flash-chars so that it is quite rare in the center. Many people prefer ahi and 
other fish done this way, but the result, quite frankly, could only be called 
an acquired taste. 
</P>
<P>
At present, desserts are catered from off premises by a well-known baker, but 
Wally said that his own pastries will appear on the cart as soon as he is able 
to install the proper ovens. In the meantime, his guests can content themselves 
with an excellent lemon tart and with sweet memories of an occasionally exotic 
but very well-handled cuisine.

A knife-wielding man was shot in the buttocks by a police officer at a La Jolla 
condominium complex about 5 a.m. Thursday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Noel Gonzalez, 28, was in fair condition at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La 
Jolla, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez, described as a transient, was brandishing a knife and "acting 
bizarre" at a complex in the 9200 block of Towne Centre Drive, said police 
spokesman Bill Robinson. Residents had called police to report a man breaking 
windows in the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Officer Charles M. Rice Jr. arrived and found Gonzalez in the parking lot of 
the complex. Rice ordered Gonzalez to put the knife down but he refused, 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The man raised the knife above his head and moved toward Rice in a threatening 
manner, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Rice fired twice from his .38 caliber service revolver, authorities said. 
Gonzalez was hit once in the left buttock, the hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting is under investigation by the homicide unit, which reviews 
shootings by police officers. Rice, a three-year veteran of the department, 
will be assigned to administrative duties pending review of the shooting.

Thirteen San Diego employers have been fined a total of $40,250 for hiring 
illegal aliens in violation of the Immigration Reform and Control Act passed by 
Congress in 1986, the Border Patrol announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The fines, levied in June, ranged from $1,250 to $9,500, said Border Patrol 
Supervisory Agent Michael Gregg. Fines can go as high as $10,000, Gregg said. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Sanchez, owner of 38th Towing/Auto Body on Imperial Avenue, said the 
$9,500 fine imposed on him will almost put him out of business. 
</P>
<P>
"They're ripping me off," Sanchez said of the Border Patrol's action. "I don't 
think it's fair. I've got one employee left."

Police found small-caliber ammunition -- similar to that used in three shooting 
deaths in Balboa Park last November -- in the same area of the park where six 
men were arrested Wednesday in connection with the fatal stabbing of an 
apparent robbery victim, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the find, police said there was no strong evidence to link the crimes 
last November with Wednesday's killing, said homicide Sgt. Frank Martinez. 
Though it had not been ruled out, such a connection was "like reaching in the 
dark," Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin James Black, 34, a San Diego resident, died of multiple stab wounds 
early Wednesday after an apparent robbery near Balboa Drive and Maple Street. 
He might have been walking or jogging in the area, Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
Police combed the park and arrested six men who had been living in the park's 
canyons. Some of the men had blood on their clothing. Fourteen people were 
initially detained for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Officers found Black's wallet and the weapon believed to have been used in his 
death close to where the men were apprehended, Martinez said. 
</P>
<P>
The six men, who identified themselves to police as Mexicans, are being held in 
County Jail downtown. The men, who told police they entered the country 
illegally, gave their names as Juan Sanchez Valenzuela, 18; Arnulfo Garcia 
Gonzales, 21; Javier Garcia Gutierrez, 19; Jamie Valdez Villareal, 22; Angel 
Munoz Espinosa, 18; and Jose Lopez Montaina, 21.

GASOLINE SPILL FORCES MANY FROM HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tanker truck carrying gasoline overturned Thursday afternoon in Southeast San 
Diego, spilling about 500 gallons onto a street and triggering the evacuation 
of hundreds of residents from nearby homes. 
</P>
<P>
About 75 San Diego firefighters, scores of police officers and at least 10 fire 
trucks responded about 3:15 p.m. to the three-alarm accident on Ocean View 
Boulevard near 33rd Street and Interstate 15. The accident drew hundreds of 
onlookers and shut down the southbound lanes of the interstate for more than 
two hours while officials transferred the tanker's fuel to another vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the bystanders were residents of the apartment buildings and small 
houses that line Ocean View and 33rd Street and who were ordered out of their 
homes by officials shortly after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Driver Unhurt 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the Armour Oil Co. tanker, Rolland Upson, was not hurt, and no 
one else was either, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicle, which had turned north onto Ocean View from I-15, lay sprawled on 
its right side on the sidewalk as officials cleaned up the spill. 
</P>
<P>
About 500 gallons of the 8,800 gallons in the tanker immediately gushed about 
200 yards down the street, trickling down an embankment overlooking the 
southbound lanes of the freeway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
After roping off the area and evacuating residents in a three-block radius, 
firefighters plugged the tanker's leak to slow the spill to 1 to 2 gallons a 
minute, according to Capt. Larry Cooke, a Fire Department spokesman. Officials 
then sprayed the truck with foam and built a small earthen dam reaching halfway 
across Ocean View to prevent the gas from traveling farther. 
</P>
<P>
"The accident is quite severe, quite hazardous," Cooke said as officials 
prepared to transfer the remaining fuel in the tanker to nearby trucks. "The 
potential of that amount of gasoline is awesome. It could be nasty." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Uncertain of Cause 
</P>
<P>
Authorities were uncertain Thursday evening what caused the truck to overturn 
and expected to complete their investigation today. 
</P>
<P>
Officials, fearful that the tanker could explode or catch fire during the 
transfer of fuel, kept the neighborhood blocked off until after 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining that spills such as Thursday's are commonplace, Cooke added: 
"Usually, you have fires to go along with it, and lose a lot of lives. We're 
just lucky it didn't explode." 
</P>
<P>
Some evacuated residents, however, said they were anxious to return to their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it was that serious," said Lucy Tauese, 19, a former student 
who, along with her four nieces and nephews, had been waiting for hours behind 
a police blockade. 
</P>
<P>
"I just heard the thing fall, and, when we came out to see it, they told us to 
evacuate our apartments."

A theatergoer in Pittsburgh found out first hand Wednesday night what it means 
to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. During a fight scene in 
the final act of the Three Rivers Shakespeare Festival's production of 
"Hamlet," a dagger sailed into the third row and hit Mrs. Patricia Spahic. The 
blade glanced her forehead, leaving a cut. Richard McMillan, who was playing 
Hamlet, immediately stopped the show and asked if there was a doctor in the 
house as the lights came up. A physician rushed to the woman's side and helped 
the stage crew escort her to an ambulance. The play resumed within minutes. 
Mrs. Spahic, 63, of Ambridge, was treated at a hospital and released. The 
mishap occurred during the fight in which Hamlet and Laertes both die. As 
Hamlet drew his dagger, it slipped from his grasp. ALEENE MacMINN

A federal judge in Atlanta Thursday dismissed part of a lawsuit that accuses 
Rob Lowe of enticing a teen-age girl into sexual encounters on videotape. The 
girl's mother, Lena Arlene Wilson, sued the actor under a Georgia law involving 
the seduction of a minor daughter, and she also alleged that Lowe intentionally 
inflicted emotional distress on her family. U.S. District Judge G. Ernest 
Tidwell, who heard arguments last week on Lowe's request that the lawsuit be 
thrown out, agreed to dismiss the claim of emotional distress, saying the suit 
did not offer enough facts to warrant the allegation. But the judge refused to 
dismiss the claim for damages for seduction. Lowe, 25, is alleged to have 
coaxed Lena Jan Parsons, then 16, into a filmed tryst involving another woman 
last summer while he was in Atlanta for the Democratic National Convention.

MILLI VANILLI COMES ON STRONG

Milli Vanilli, the red-hot foreign dance-music duo, entered Billboard 
magazine's pop Top Five -- at No. 5 -- with their first album. Two hit singles, 
including recent No. 1 "Baby Don't Forget My Number," fueled the album's quick 
trip up the pop chart. Fine Young Cannibals' "The Raw and the Cooked" is No. 1 
for the seventh week. Prince's "Batman" sound-track album vaulted up to No. 7 
after just two weeks, climbing even faster than his "Batdance" single (No. 6). 
In a week or two, both could be No. 1. White Lion's new one, "Big Game," is 
roaring up the chart, reaching No. 33 in just three weeks. "Tin Machine," the 
album by David Bowie's new group Tin Machine, doesn't have much staying power. 
It shot up to No. 28 before starting its decline, slipping to No. 39 after only 
six chart weeks. The new No. 1 pop single is Simply Red's "If You Don't Know Me 
By Now." 
</P>
<P>
* This sound-track album, a rapidly rising No. 24, is just about as hot as the 
"Ghostbusters II" movie Bobby Brown's single, "On Our Own" -- another creation 
of producers-composers L.A. Reid and Babyface -- is No. 12 and part of the 
reason for the success of the album.

A REWARDING WAIT FOR 'GODOT' AT OLD GLOBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Let us not waste our time in idle discourse, says Vladimir in Beckett's 
"Waiting for Godot." 
</P>
<P>
The joke's on him, of course, for he and his partner Estragon can do little 
else except "waste their time in idle discourse" as they wait for Godot. 
</P>
<P>
The first challenge in any production of "Godot" is to seduce the members of 
the audience into believing that they are not wasting their time by listening 
to the idle discourse of these two lonely tramps on their Godot-forsaken 
country road. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew J. Traister's staging at the Old Globe's Cassius Carter Centre Stage 
succeeds at this magnificently for most of its two hours-plus. No one could 
accuse this "Godot" of being arid or airless. This is an audience show. 
</P>
<P>
And it's not just for audiences who appreciate irony. For example, while the 
irony of the "idle discourse" line drew a hefty laugh on opening night, the 
absolute stillness of the audience during the "long silences" that follow a 
second-act exchange about the voices of the dead was an even stronger piece of 
evidence that this "Godot" was connecting, that the discourse really didn't 
seem so idle after all. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan McMurtry's Vladimir and Richard Easton's Estragon are intensely human. 
Despite the hopelessness of their situation, they embrace each other with 
infectious warmth. They take genuine pleasure in each other's eccentricities, 
even in each other's ability to bicker in return. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir is the philosopher prince of "Godot," and McMurtry wraps his voice 
around Vladimir's attempts to justify his actions and non-actions, as if he has 
all the time in the world -- which, in a way, he does. But when Estragon goes 
away for the night or even tries to take a nap, impatience suddenly rears its 
head within this Vladimir. The corners of his puffy eyes betray his fear. 
</P>
<P>
That fear is much more apparent in Easton's Estragon, as is every other 
emotion. This is a hungry and tired man, with an appropriately lean look, but 
he's also one whose eyes light up at any sign of change, no matter how 
pathetic. 
</P>
<P>
The two tramps' primary visitors are the slave driver Pozzo and his slave 
Lucky, and Jeffrey Allan Chandler and Richard Kneeland are sensationally 
theatrical in these wonderfully showy roles. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler's Pozzo preens and preaches and throws bones at everyone in his path. 
Even when he is blind, in the second act, his railing at his fate retains a 
sense of command. 
</P>
<P>
Kneeland's Lucky, by contrast, is a shambles -- florid-faced, trembling, with a 
rush of white hair that descends halfway down his back. As he hoists Pozzo's 
bags or does his wretched little dance for the benefit of the others, he looks 
as if he may have a heart attack at any moment. 
</P>
<P>
Kyle Wares plays the young boy who brings messages from Godot with a fine 
deadpan. 
</P>
<P>
Traister's arena staging only occasionally results in blocked sight lines (at 
least from the quarter of the audience where I sat), and the compensation is 
that every seat in the house is close to the heart of the non-action. 
</P>
<P>
The arena configuration also adds to the impression that Vladimir and Estragon 
are literally going in circles, that they will never escape this desolated way 
station. When they try to escape, or simply to avoid the more unpleasant 
aspects of their encounter with Pozzo and Lucky, the short aisles quickly put a 
stop to their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The design -- by Cliff Faulkner (sets), Shigeru Yaji (costumes) and John B. 
Forbes (lights) -- carefully observes Beckett's directions. 
</P>
<P>
But there are a few too many mixed signals indicating where this way station 
is. Pozzo pronounces schedule in the British style, and Easton maintains a 
slight British accent throughout. Yet it sounded as if Vladimir referred to a 
past experience picking grapes in the Napa Country (the text says Macon 
Country). The references should either be consistent or else completely 
neutral. 
</P>
<P>
The momentum of the second act occasionally flags, but this isn't surprising -- 
in fact, it's part of the point of the play. As Vladimir says, "habit is a 
great deadener." Yet it's indicative of the strength of the play that this line 
occurs in a speech that more or less brings the play to a climax, as Vladimir's 
resolve begins to crack. 
</P>
<P>
Habit may deaden, but this production makes sure that "Godot" remains alive.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: DINNER AT 8 IN A GRAND (AVENUE) HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH REICHL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Checkers, 535 S. Grand Ave., Los Angeles, (213) 624-0000, is so new that when 
you ask where the restrooms are they hand you the key to one of the hotel rooms 
upstairs: the restaurant's restrooms are not quite completed. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, however, the restaurant at Checkers feels as if it has been 
here for a while. The room itself has a staid and settled feeling, very 
reminiscent of that of its sister hotel, San Francisco's Campton Place. The 
menu is reminiscent of Campton Place's too, if only because it does not seem to 
offer typical hotel fare. 
</P>
<P>
For starters there are appetizers such as a roasted onion with an aioli made of 
pinenuts, or seviche of 
</P>
<P>
scallops with bits of orange and chile resting on a sort of spaghetti made of 
cucumbers. There is a Caesar salad that is heavy on the garlic and the 
anchovies. Entrees include grilled salmon with walnuts and asparagus, 
saltimboca of rabbit with morels, a simple grilled chicken, loin of lamb. The 
dessert list, which is long and enticing, includes strawberry shortcake, 
devil's food cake and tapioca brulee. Prices, given that this is a luxury 
hotel, are not excessive; appetizers start at $4, entrees are mostly in the 
mid-teens and desserts average $5. 
</P>
<P>
It's still early, but probably not too soon to say that this is a welcome 
addition to downtown dining.RUTH REICHL

OFF VINE: HIGHS, AND LOWS OF HOLLYWOOD STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A shark is diving through the roof of a plain clapboard house. Is it a motif? A 
metaphor? Something to write about in a restaurant review? 
</P>
<P>
It might just be a ready-made topic for a restaurant review. Of course, the 
shark does happen to be the main clue that Off Vine is a restaurant. If it 
weren't for its tail projecting from the roof and the impact pattern painted 
around it on the shingles (plus a discreet magenta neon sign on the front of 
the building), Off Vine would look just like any other house on this quiet 
residential street. 
</P>
<P>
But consider: Inside, Off Vine is a comfortable, homey sort of place, and the 
menu has a certain reassuring quality. There's a New York steak with Jack 
Daniels sauce, really rather good, the sauce not mawkishly sweet as you might 
expect from the bourbon. Little loin lamb chops come in a pureed herb sauce of 
very green color and very subdued flavor, and three-cheese ravioli (actually, 
capelletti) in a very little bit of garlicky wine sauce. 
</P>
<P>
One appetizer has a vaguely avant-garde sound, but turns out to be flamboyantly 
retrograde, scallops in puff pastry with a lot of irresistible butter sauce. 
There are a couple of old-fashioned butter sauces around, come to think of it, 
such as the one with leeks in it on the chicken with an egg-and-herb stuffing. 
The so-called "shredded potato pancakes" are an awful lot like the 
old-fashioned potato basket, though browned to the limit and maybe a bit 
beyond. 
</P>
<P>
But this is Hollywood -- indeed, Off Vine is located just around the corner 
from Sunset and Vine -- and these are wacked-out gastronomic days. There is 
always the possibility of health and/or California influences infiltrating, 
possibly even through the roof. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, the menu is full of the words "sun-dried tomatoes," and the pastas 
tend to have a certain California quality, as in a special of angel hair with 
salmon and goat cheese, a perfectly acceptable combination that was bound to 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
A sweet red pepper is stuffed with ricotta and capers, with a couple of 
unexpected treats on the same plate: asparagus in honey mustard sauce, a disk 
of French goat cheese on a bed of cilantro/red pepper sauce. And look at this, 
a "mushroom carpaccio" of mushrooms pleasantly marinated in vinegar, arranged 
around a mound of polenta that tastes as if it's actually made with American 
hominy grits (I do notice that when you order this, the waitress writes 
"mush"). 
</P>
<P>
There's a hamburger on the menu at both lunch and dinner, but it turns out to 
be a turkeyburger. It's exceptionally good, as turkeyburgers go, and the sauces 
-- Dijon mustard, hot chile mayonnaise and a barbecue sauce-like catsup -- make 
pretty good sense with turkeyburger. But the waitress points out the health 
benefits of turkey-eating, and there's spinach instead of lettuce. Spinach 
isn't awful on a turkeyburger, but I think I see a dent appearing in the 
ceiling, as if made by some blunt snout! 
</P>
<P>
No, there's nothing there. A lot of old houses just look like that. I should 
relax with the nice old-fashioned desserts, particularly the wonderfully 
crunchy blueberry crumb cake. It really is good, and makes me proud that I 
never bought into that obvious shark thing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Off Vine, 6263 Leland Way, Hollywood. (213) 962-1900. Open for lunch Monday 
through Friday, for dinner Monday through Saturday. Beer and wine. Street 
parking. MasterCard and Visa accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $28 to $63.

ROBERT ADAMS: A ROMANTIC COMES TO GRIPS WITH ECOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENA DONOHUE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the mid 1800s, the arts lauded nature's innocence with images of exotic 
retreats and land unaltered by man. It's hard to imagine how the brooding 
idealism of the Romantic Age might have reconciled contemporary realities like 
Three Mile Island or Yosemite peppered with plastic foam instead of summer 
snow. 
</P>
<P>
In the works of nationally acclaimed photographer Robert Adams, romanticism 
comes to grips with ecology. The 200 photographs that make up Adams' 
retrospective exhibition, "To Make It Home: Photos of the American West," show 
a sublime and still nature in an uneasy truce with mankind's often ungraceful 
presence. The national traveling show, at the County Museum of Art (to July 
16), surveys works from the mid-'60s to the mid-'80s, organized by the Alfred 
Stieglitz Center at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
Adams was born in 1937, fought polio and asthma as a child and became a college 
English professor. He took up the camera in 1965 as a way to record his 
frustration as the natural beauty of his hometown Denver fell prey to suburban 
progress. His earliest images recorded what he calls "prairie structures," 
desolate churches and motels isolated against billowing expanses of western sky 
and open terrain. 
</P>
<P>
By 1969 his prints were in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New 
York; by the early '70s Adams was included in important landscape photography 
shows at MOMA and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Today he is considered among 
the foremost chroniclers of the American West. 
</P>
<P>
Adams' ancestors were among the first to settle and explore the West, so in the 
late '60s he set out to photograph the so-called First Range of the Rocky 
Mountains. Majestic and forbidding like most of Adams' imagery, these peaks 
were the first obstacle met by early pioneers moving west. These were the peaks 
that inspired Kathryn Lee Bates to write "America the Beautiful," but Adams' 
perverse lens captures the slapdash track homes that greedy speculators put up 
by the hundreds just below them. An excellent work depicts a huge canopy of 
crystalline sky and a low slung horizon where we make out an empty drive-in 
theater dwarfed and made banal by the spectacular walls of granite looming just 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
Works from the subsequent "Denver" suite capture resilient cottonwood trees, 
wild shrubs or airborne geese surviving in the midst of burgeoning city life. 
One of the most compelling images in the exhibition depicts a rural expanse 
roughly titled "Burning Oil Sludge." 
</P>
<P>
Adamantly anti-nuclear and pro-environment, Adams' politics lie heavy in the 
1979 collection "Our Lives and Our Children: Photographs Taken Near the Rocky 
Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant." Skewed camera angles and selective cropping seem 
to distort the faces of pregnant mothers and romping children, giving the 
candid photos a quiet desperation one also senses in Adams' writings about 
nuclear threat.

The sweeping, poetic images in the series "Summer Nights," "Prairie" and "From 
the Missouri River West" are not so placard-toting. Their ideological stand 
comes from soothing, tender vistas of bucolic western sites that look coaxed 
from nature. A lovely atmospheric view of the undulating Missouri River, 
moonlit farm houses and a sharp, linear shot of a Nebraska school house reveal 
that Adams' stance is ultimately hopeful and that he is, above all, a sensitive 
technician, respectful of light as the revealer of photographic form and 
structure.

The Pacific Theatre Ensemble's storefront space in Venice has served many 
useful purposes -- as the stage for Jamie Baker's engrossing family dramas, as 
a murky arena for "Slaughterhouse on Tanner's Close" -- but never before as a 
campfire ground. 
</P>
<P>
In "Troy Evans' Montana Tales and Other Bad Ass Business," there is no actual 
campfire. But performer Evans gives us the campfire experience, the essence of 
being caught on the hooks of a genial storyteller who knows he has the best 
yarns of anyone in the group, yet isn't about to make a big deal about it. With 
the friendly atmosphere, and the glow of such a gentle voice emitted from such 
a burly body, no one is about to put Evans to a tall-tale contest. 
</P>
<P>
That isn't what he is about in any case. Evans is unashamedly autobiographical, 
as ready to depict himself as the goat in a story (especially the ones in which 
he's the bartender/owner of a rough Montana saloon) as the good guy. This 
dilutes what at first seems to be some humor done at the expense of down-home 
Montana folks -- all the men wear Wrangler jeans, and a typical pot-luck 
contribution is a huge slab of beef. 
</P>
<P>
Evans genuinely likes them, while -- despite being a Montana native -- 
fascinated at the larger-than-life culture, the way a journalist might be. Now 
a busy actor, Evans is of these people, and apart from them. This is why his 
show feels so balanced. 
</P>
<P>
Evans happens to have been lucky enough to live through some wild adventures, 
then live to tell the story. Aside from a finale as indulgent as he fears it 
may be when introducing it, he paces his tales so that they harmonize rather 
than compete with each other. It's only late into this campfire session that 
you realize how many awful and life-threatening passages Evans says he has 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
Anything for a story. 
</P>
<P>
 At 705 1/2 Venice Blvd., Saturdays, 10:30 p.m., through Aug. 5. Tickets: $10; 
(213) 422-3665. 
</P>
<P>
'Barbie and Ken' 
</P>
<P>
What a difference a year makes. Justin Tanner's 1988 play, "Red Tide," was 
stuck in the doldrums of most teen movies. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner's new comedy takes more risks, and swims much further. A play titled 
"Barbie and Ken at Home" immediately suggests cartoonish black comedy (which it 
is), but at the Cast Theatre under Tanner's adroit direction, it is also 
endowed with a melancholic undercurrent. It's easy to laugh at Barbie (Adrienne 
Stout) for working graveyard shift at a doughnut shop, drinking gallons of 
coffee and making dinner out of Hamburger Helper and Ritz crackers, but we also 
worry for her. As with Dan Teachout's Ken, there's a better person that got 
lost since high school days 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner hasn't quite worked out the means to, and results of, bringing matters 
to a head (the agent of change, Jon Amirkham's affecting and uncliched nerdish 
salesman, amusingly holds a deus ex machina -- a vacuum cleaner). But his 
twisting of the action as the salesman gets enmeshed in a domestic nightmare 
helps the play find its moral voice. The casting is outstanding, as Stout and 
Teachout go at each other like pent-up creatures inches away from pure 
barbarism. Andy Daley's set instantly establishes things -- an apartment for 
trash, not people. 
</P>
<P>
 At 804 N. El Centro Ave., Tuesdays through Thursdays, 8 p.m., until July 27. 
Tickets: $12; (213) 462-0265. 
</P>
<P>
'Best Wishes' 
</P>
<P>
Too much American theater is stuck in the kitchen sink or the living room. And 
though Bill Barker's play, "Best Wishes," is very much in the living room, it 
is an example of how a good play can still take place there. 
</P>
<P>
A good play, not a great play. 
</P>
<P>
Harold H. Dershimer's revival of this Kansas family drama at the tiny Courtyard 
Playhouse is not even remotely near the passion of the Gnu Theatre's staging in 
1985, and more than a few areas (including Dershimer's set and Melinda 
Messenger's and Tom Stellar's lights) are at the community theater level. This 
tends to expose a play's warts: after the strong emotional rise of Act I, the 
second act nearly runs off course until the central sibling rivalry of Elda and 
Dorie restores direction. 
</P>
<P>
"Best Wishes" is a play in which that overused term arc really has meaning; 
thus, the actors have to see through to where the family fights are leading, 
while remaining in the moment. Mel Donnelly as the elder brother and Jean 
Jordan's Vera, a woman full of unrealized good intentions, follow their arcs. 
Linda Hurst as Dorie and Madeline Hall as Elda -- both miscast, not looking 
remotely like the rest of the family -- fall into easy sniping behavior without 
suggesting the underlying love revealed at the end. The play's concluding 
happiness is both adult and well-earned, something lost in this production. 
</P>
<P>
 At 550 Deep Valley Drive, Palos Verdes, in the Courtyard Shopping Mall (third 
level), Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7:30 p.m., through July 23. 
Tickets: $5-$7.50; (213) 544-6555. 
</P>
<P>
'Sunday Breakfast' 
</P>
<P>
Wrapped in a Freudian maze of dream imagery, symbolism and half-baked notions 
of feminine self-abuseP. O'Connor's "Sunday Breakfast" at the Chamber Theatre 
looks like a premature birth, a first draft unthinkingly submitted to public 
scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
More than the play (which has some very clever and/or gripping passages in the 
first act), what requires scrutiny is the reasoning behind giving it a full 
production before it is ready. The tricky text, in which a drunk housewife 
lives with visions of her runaway boy while a friendly burglar and her bullying 
estranged husband alternately invade her domain, has gone almost completely 
unexamined. The actors (Cyndi Strittmatter's wife, Erik Fredrickson's husband, 
JP Hubbell's burglar, Kris Newquist's boy) seem mystified by the crude 
absurdist action and walk zombie-like through their roles. For a setting that's 
specifically "an old apartment building somewhere in Hollywood," Dawn R. 
Ferry's ersatz impressionist-cubist set is out of a different universe. 
</P>
<P>
A show so at odds with itself is not serving the young playwright's young play. 
Let it start to walk; then show it to us. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3759 Cahuenga Blvd. West, Studio City, Fridays through Sundays, 8 p.m., 
through July 23. Tickets: $12; (213) 472-0525. 
</P>
<P>
'The Singles' Guide' 
</P>
<P>
Had Richard Polak made Adam Slade, radio deejay and soliloquist of singles' 
laments, a central character of his new work, "The Singles' Guide" at the 
Richmond Shepard Theatre, he might have found some kind of anchor for his 
play's observations. As it is, Slade (Jeff Hanley) intones like a burned-out 
Greek chorus ("How much love do we have left?" is a repeated rhetorical chant) 
and coolly ushers in the seven skits that make up this "Guide." 
</P>
<P>
His comments suggest something more profound than anything that develops in 
these facile, superficial scenes. Slade vicariously absorbs other lonely 
people's sadness while not quite concealing his own. No one in the sketches -- 
not the boorish lout (Neil Kevnik), nor the less-than-sensitive friend (Earl 
Johnson), nor the paranoid frequent dater (Lillian Byrd) -- seems capable of 
such sadness. 
</P>
<P>
The slick glibness, combined with the sense of between-commercials brevity, is 
an '80s update of "Love American Style." Patricia Yasutake has unfortunately 
directed to reinforce this feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6468 Santa Monica Blvd., Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., indefinitely. 
Tickets: $10-$12; (213) 466-1767.

ABC, CBS TOP HUMANITAS PRIZE WINNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABC's Emmy-winning series "The Wonder Years" and "China Beach," a CBS 
Schoolbreak Special entitled "My Past Is My Own," an installment of ABC's "New 
Adventures of Winnie the Pooh" and an ABC documentary on breast cancer, 
"Destined to Live," were all winners in the 15th annual Humanitas Prize 
competition, announced Thursday at the Century Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The Humanitas Prizes, sponsored by the Pacific Palisades-based Human Family 
Institute, are given each year to network television shows which exemplify 
"humanizing achievement in television writing." 
</P>
<P>
This year's awards were given in the following categories: 30-minute ($10,000); 
60-minute ($15,000), non prime-time childrens' live program ($10,000), 
children's animated program ($10,000) and documentary (no cash award). 
</P>
<P>
As was previously announced, for the first time in its history, there were no 
nominees -- and consequently no winners -- in the $25,000 category for TV 
movies. Judges said earlier that none of this season's movies was worthy of a 
prize. 
</P>
<P>
The winning "Wonder Years" episode, entitled "Pottery Will Get You Nowhere," 
was written by Matthew Carlson, and dealt with a conflict in the Arnold family 
that made son Kevin question the stability of the family. The "China Beach" 
episode "Promised Land," written by Patricia Green, explored racial conflict 
among the troops in Vietnam following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr. CBS' "My Past Is My Own," written by Alan Gansberg, featured two 
teen-agers exploring their own histories. The "Winnie the Pooh" episode was 
written by Mike Zaslove, Doug Hutchinson and Larry Bernard; "Destined to Live" 
was penned by Sasha Ferrer. 
</P>
<P>
That the judges found no TV movies worth honoring is a symptom of what Father 
Ellwood Kieser, president of the Human Family Institute, calls "a period of 
transition and serious problems" in Hollywood. Kieser believes that increasing 
economic pressures on the networks caused by viewing alternatives such as cable 
and videocassettes, as well as recent corporate takeovers at the networks, have 
left the Big Three networks financially strapped and more likely to favor 
ratings over quality than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
"All three networks have changed ownership in recent months," Kieser said 
during remarks at the Humanitas Prize luncheon at the Century Plaza. "Those who 
bought them have incurred huge debts in the process. That means they are now 
saddled with staggering interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
"In some quarters, this has created a preoccupation with the bottom line that 
generates fear, stifles creativity and squeezes out value-oriented 
programming," Kieser said. "The tension between the creative and the economic 
is intrinsic to our business. But the situation seems worse now, much worse." 
</P>
<P>
Although all the networks, particularly NBC, blamed last summer's 154-day 
Writers Guild of America strike for some lapses in taste last season, Kieser 
said in an interview that the strike did not cause the current climate in 
Hollywood. "I really don't think that was the was the main ingredient," he 
said. "It's the pressure -- and it doesn't help to have one studio warring 
against another," he added, referring to the Paramount's ongoing attempt at 
hostile takeover of Time, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In response to that erosion of quality, Kieser announced at the luncheon that 
Humanitas will expand its educational program for Writers Guild members by 
adding a 10-week course to its current program of three yearly seminars on "the 
incorporation of human values into entertainment programming." Kieser also 
plans to launch a series of workshops for beginning writers to be conducted by 
master writers, "to facilitate the formation of writers' support groups and to 
arrange for a mentoring program for novice writers. And, Kieser said, the Human 
Family institute plans to increase incentive for screenwriters by upping the 
cash value of the prizes so that they stay current with inflation (the awards 
are still the same size they were 15 years ago), and become "comparable in the 
aggregate to the Nobel, Templeton and MacArthur prizes." 
</P>
<P>
he group also plans to expand the awards to include a PBS/cable television 
category and a feature film category, as part of a 10-year plan to foster 
responsibility to the public among Hollywood's writers. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood has consistently made 'human-values' (feature) films," Kieser said. 
" 'Rain Man,' for example, showed a greedy narcissistic human being who by the 
end of the film had become very loving." 
</P>
<P>
Kieser said that "human values" should not be mistranslated to mean family 
entertainment; nor is the new award an attempt to rid film of profanity, sex or 
violence. "A movie could contain rough language and still be full of human 
values," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kieser added that, while he believes the current trend of advertisers or 
advocacy groups boycotting television shows for language or content is their 
prerogative and does not represent censorship, Humanitas prefers to "nurture 
the good things" rather than try to force shows off the air. But "I don't think 
these (advocacy groups) are nutsies -- they just want shows on the air that 
they would want their kids to see," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kieser said the time frame for the new awards and programs has not been set. In 
part, it depends on another 10-year goal: to increase the current $1 million 
Humanitas endowment for the awards by $4 million, through donations from the 
independent producers, the major studios and the networks. 
</P>
<P>
Kieser has already secured some support from Marcy Carsey of Carsey/Werner, 
Grant Tinker of GTG Entertainment, Norman Lear and an independent producer who 
requested anonymity. They have all made 10-year pledges of $250,000. Alan 
Landsburg has pledged $200,000, David Milch $50,000, and the Finnegan/Pinchuk 
Company will donate $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic," Kieser said in the interview. "I think there is a keen 
awareness on the part of the entertainment community that they have a 
responsibility, not just to entertain, but to enrich. They give money not just 
because they have it, but because they know they owe it to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"So many of the poorer (TV) shows take you away from life, they are a 
narcotic," he added. "Shows which contain human values really inspire you to 
want to live it."

HOME TECH: MPAA SEEKS TO TONE DOWN THAT EYEBROW-RAISING VIDEO BOX-ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the home video market -- as in the theatrical market -- sex and violence 
sell. When the pictures on the movie packages, called "box-art," suggest one or 
the other, they attract renters. 
</P>
<P>
These days, though, those racy pictures are also attracting trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four states have legislation pending regarding home video, some seeking 
to control box-art. To head off government regulation, the Motion Picture Assn. 
of America, which rates movies and videos, is trying to get video companies to 
tone down their box-art. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of parents don't want their kids to see these offensive pictures on the 
packages of home video movies," said association executive Bethlyn Hand. "So 
they're trying to get laws passed to control what their kids are exposed to in 
the stores. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in sympathy with the parents. Remember, the purpose of the rating system 
is to provide a guide for parents who are concerned about the content of the 
movies their kids see. But we also want to help the movie and home video 
industries avoid government regulation." 
</P>
<P>
Through its rating service, the association also can control box-art. 
</P>
<P>
"If a video company wants a rating, they have to submit their ad campaigns and 
ad materials to us," Hand said. "That's the way it's always worked with movies. 
If we think the advertising is lurid, we reject it. If we don't approve the 
advertising then they can't get a rating." 
</P>
<P>
When scrutinizing ad materials, like box-art, what do Hand and her staff look 
for? 
</P>
<P>
"The main thing is that the advertising must be suitable for general 
audiences," she said. "There's a long list of things we look for. No nudity, no 
excessive violence, no guns pointed at people's heads, no drugs or drug 
paraphernalia, no cruelty to animals, no people on fire, no dead people with 
their eyes open. I could go on and on." 
</P>
<P>
Video companies have the option to ignore the association's restrictions and 
send their movies straight to the retailers. But many stores won't carry 
unrated movies or they bury them with the porn titles, where most customers 
won't see them. 
</P>
<P>
The offensive box-art comes not from the majors but mostly from small companies 
that are marketing B and C titles -- those cheapie movies that are low in 
quality but high in sex and violence. 
</P>
<P>
Since the bulk of these movies have had limited or no theatrical release, most 
rental customers aren't familiar with them. That's where box-art is crucial. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that fans often rent movies based on what they see on the package," 
said Tom Burnett, executive vice president of Virgin Vision, which releases 
some B titles. "That's what video retailers tell us. And video retailers stock 
many videos based on the package art. On these lesser-known movies, if they 
think the art will attract renters they'll stock that video. 
</P>
<P>
"Packages that are really lurid and explicit catch the customer's eye. Those 
pictures plus the description on the box are often the only bases for the 
customer's decision." 
</P>
<P>
Though video companies would like to avoid legislation, toning down the 
box-art, they contend, could lead to another problem. 
</P>
<P>
"We're concerned with truth-in-advertising," Burnett said. "If you tone down 
the pictures on the boxes, people might rent the movie thinking it's very 
innocent -- as innocent as the pictures on the box. But then they'll get it 
home and find it's full of sex and violence. Remember, we're talking about 
movies people don't know much about -- the lesser-known movies people rent 
based on the pictures on the package. 
</P>
<P>
"The angry customers blame the retailers for misleading them, for having a 
package that's not representative of the content. And then retailers blame us. 
But our hands are tied by the MPAA, which is restricting what we can depict on 
the packages." 
</P>
<P>
Though Burnett said he's fully in favor of the association's intentions, he's 
not too happy with some of its practices, claiming that a double-standard 
exists -- one for the movie industry and one for home video. 
</P>
<P>
"They examine advertising for both movies and videos and they let the movie 
companies get away with things we can't do," he said. "For instance, in the ads 
for 'Dead Calm,' there was a head floating in the water. Yet, the MPAA rejected 
some pieces of art for Virgin Vision movies that weren't as offensive as that 
head floating in the water. They're discriminating in favor of theatrical 
advertising." 
</P>
<P>
Burnett believes the association should be more sensitive to the fact that the 
video business is different from the theatrical. 
</P>
<P>
"Marketing movies and home videos is very different," he said. "Movies are for 
broad audiences who watch in a public place. Home videos are more private, 
intended for use in the privacy of your home. Movies and home videos are 
different, so different standards should apply to the way movies and videos are 
marketed. But the MPAA doesn't see that." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hand: "These video companies should stop griping about what the MPAA is 
doing and abide by our rules. We're just trying to establish some control 
before the government steps in. If these video companies think we're tough, 
wait until they see what happens if some of these states pass these laws."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN INJURED BY LEFTOVER FIRECRACKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A North Hollywood woman was seriously injured Wednesday when she lit a large 
firecracker she recovered from a trash bin, believing it was a candle, fire 
department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Estella Rica, 54, suffered burns to her right hand and left foot, Los Angeles 
City Fire Department officials said. Rica told paramedics she had recovered the 
two-inch firecracker from a plastic bag in a dumpster behind her Victory 
Boulevard apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Rica told paramedics that she was in the kitchen of her apartment when she lit 
the firecracker. 
</P>
<P>
As the fuse began to hiss, she dropped the firecracker to the floor and it 
exploded. 
</P>
<P>
Rica was taken to St. Joseph's Medical Center in Burbank, where spokeswoman 
Alexis Parkes said a plastic surgeon was attempting to reconstruct Rica's badly 
damaged right hand. 
</P>
<P>
The blast did not damage Rica's apartment, a Fire Department spokesman said.

AVALON DECIDES TO LET TUNA CLUB OFF THE HOOK; 
</P>
<P>
CITY SATISFIED THAT ORGANIZATION WILL NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Avalon city officials, after months of inquiry, have accepted assurances by the 
all-male Tuna Club that the club does not discriminate against women. 
</P>
<P>
At an Avalon City Council meeting Wednesday, attended by Tuna Club President 
Jim Martin and other club members, City Atty. Michael Jenkins told the council 
that letters to the city from the Tuna Club, most recently on June 9, had 
resolved the issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Issue of Discrimination 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, Jenkins said the city had requested assurances that 
the club "will not discriminate in their membership policies, business 
practices and the operation of their facilities. We asked them to affirm that 
that would be their policy, and they have done that, and we are satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins said the club "has taken a position consistent with the position that 
we asked them to take." 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the city March 14, Martin had said the club did not discriminate 
"on the basis of race, sex, religion or national origin in its membership 
policies and practices." 
</P>
<P>
But city officials insisted that the club's nondiscrimination policy must also 
extend to the operation of the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Chuck Prince said the June 9 letter "basically says uncle. It says 
we assure you that we don't discriminate in our practices and in our 
membership. The council and city officials felt that the letter was 
satisfactory." 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Martin said that although the club's board of directors 
considered the use of club facilities a private matter, the board had 
nonetheless directed him to assure the city that the club "does not and will 
not discriminate in the operation and utilization of the club facilities 
(except for restrooms, shower rooms and changing rooms) on the basis of sex, 
race, religion and national origin." 
</P>
<P>
Martin was unavailable for comment Thursday.

The 91-year-old private sportfishing club, on Santa Catalina Island oceanfront 
property, leases its facilities from the city for $4,800 a year under a 10-year 
lease that expires in December. 
</P>
<P>
The city's inquiry into the club's operation began last October, when City 
Councilwoman Irene Strobel asked that the city investigate whether the club 
restricted its membership to men and, if so, whether leasing publicly owned 
land to such a group would violate state and federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of letters sent to the city, club officials said the club does not 
prohibit women from becoming members. 
</P>
<P>
To join the club, prospective members must be nominated for associate 
membership by a current member, club officials said. To advance to active 
membership, an associate member must catch a fish exceeding a certain weight, 
depending on the kind of fish. 
</P>
<P>
The club has fewer than 200 members, most of whom live on the mainland, club 
officials said. Some members maintain vacation homes on the island, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After Wednesday's meeting, Strobel said the city and the club had come a long 
way toward resolving the issue but that she was concerned about how the city 
would monitor whether the club restricted women. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'm going to have to keep trucking forward on this," said Strobel, the 
only female council member. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Have Agreed' 
</P>
<P>
"They have agreed not to discriminate, and that's an important step forward. 
I'm hoping there will be a mechanism to allow the city to monitor and enforce 
this nondiscrimination requirement." 
</P>
<P>
Prince said the city would investigate any reports of sexual discrimination at 
the club. 
</P>
<P>
Club officials have notified the city of their intent to renew the lease for 
another 10 years, Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
Prince, Mayor Hugh T. (Bud) Smith and Councilman Hal Host plan to meet with 
club officials within the next few months to discuss the terms of the lease, 
Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to talk to them a little about the price, who maintains the club in 
case it's damaged by a storm, and access, being open on a from time-to-time 
basis for community groups and citizens to use," Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
The white, New England-style building was heavily damaged in a January, 1988, 
storm. Club members are paying for those repairs, a member said. 
</P>
<P>
Strobel said the opening of club facilities for some city-sanctioned functions 
would be a good-will gesture that would serve the community and the club. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I'll be satisfied when all the mechanisms are in place to make it a 
smooth-running operation for both the city and for them," Strobel said.

DISTRICT ACCUSES PORTER RANCH DEVELOPER OF CONFLICT; 
</P>
<P>
AS A STATE WATCHDOG NATHAN SHAPELL URGED THE SCHOOL BOARD TO SELL ITS EXCESS 
LAND. HE BOUGHT 37 ACRES OF IT. 
</P>

<P>
Beginning in the mid-1970s, businessman Nathan Shapell -- in his role as 
chairman of a state watchdog commission -- sharply criticized Los Angeles 
school officials for refusing to sell unused school sites. 
</P>
<P>
Shapell, a prominent developer, later benefited from his own advice when the 
Los Angeles Unified School District began disposing of surplus school sites. In 
1978, as Shapell began assembling parcels for his proposed $2-billion Porter 
Ranch development, he purchased 37 acres of nearby school district land that 
had been planned for a high school. 
</P>
<P>
Today, with the Porter Ranch project nearing final consideration by the Los 
Angeles City Council, school officials are searching for a school site for the 
hundreds of children expected from the 3,000-home development in the hills 
north of the Simi Valley Freeway in Chatsworth. And some school board members 
say they are angry they must ask for land from the same man who told them to 
sell property while serving as chairman of the state's 13-member Little Hoover 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a conflict of interest," board member Julie Korenstein said 
Thursday. "He wanted schools closed, and the district to sell land that was not 
being used, and then he buys it up. I think that is wrong." Korenstein 
represents the West San Fernando Valley and has been a vocal critic of the 
Porter Ranch development. 
</P>
<P>
"The Little Hoover Commission was directly responsible for the fact that school 
district property was sold," said Roberta Weintraub, school board president. 
"It was a terrible mistake." 
</P>
<P>
Weintraub said she did not know Shapell had purchased the site near Tampa 
Avenue and Sesnon Boulevard in Northridge about a mile from the Porter Ranch 
project. "I think that would be a conflict of interest," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Clarke, a spokesman for Shapell, disagreed. Shapell was only one of 13 
commissioners, he said, and did not force the board to sell any property. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the board's decision," Clarke said. "They put the property up for sale, 
they asked for bids and they approved the sale. They're all big boys and girls 
here . . . nobody was holding a gun to anybody's head." 
</P>
<P>
It made sense for Shapell to buy the property because he was buying much of the 
adjacent land, Clarke said. "If you had a piece of your back yard that you did 
not own, and the owner put it up for sale, wouldn't you buy it?" Shapell could 
not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke said Porter Ranch Development Co. is obligated to pay for schools with 
an estimated $15 million in developer fees on the project, which also includes 
6 million square feet of commercial space. He said the company has agreed to 
sell the district five acres for an elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
But Korenstein said the district needs at least 10 acres for an elementary 
school and possibly a junior high school. District officials have said they 
fear the $15 million in developer fees will not be enough to pay for land and 
school construction when the Porter Ranch project is completed over the next 20 
to 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Little Hoover Commission, known officially as the Commission on California 
State Government Organization and Economy, issued reports in 1973 and 1978 that 
called for districts statewide, including Los Angeles, to raise revenues by 
selling or leasing unused properties. 
</P>
<P>
School district records show Shapell's development company was interested in 
buying the Northridge site as early as 1976. 
</P>
<P>
The commission continued its pressure in the 1980s, when the Los Angeles 
district was the subject of commission hearings and reports. The commission in 
1980 criticized the Los Angeles district for failing to heed its earlier 
recommendations and in 1981 again urged the district to "lease or sell schools 
and properties at market value." 
</P>
<P>
In its 1981 report, the commission charged that the district had not sold any 
unused sites since the issue was first raised in 1972. In fact, Shapell's 
company had purchased the Northridge site in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Although the commission's reports were advisory only, Weintraub, who was first 
elected to the board in 1979, said Shapell and the commission pressured the 
seven-member board to sell school properties that the district now wishes it 
had to house the city's growing school-age population. 
</P>
<P>
Board member Jackie Goldberg said that clearly Shapell, who still sits on the 
Little Hoover Commission, had a private interest in the sale of school district 
property. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that it is unfortunate that he bought land after he advised us to sell 
it," said Goldberg, who was elected to the board in 1983. "The advice may be 
perfectly legitimate but that is not the issue. The issue is public perception, 
and the perception still stinks." 
</P>
<P>
Former board member Tom Bartman, who was elected in 1980, said he does not 
recall that the commission pressured the board into selling any of its unused 
properties. "The board was acting independent of the commission," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein, who has been on the board since 1987, said the district should not 
have sold the school site. Shapell paid $1.5 million for the land in 1978. As 
of last October, the company had built and sold 124 homes there. 
</P>
<P>
To replace that land now, as well as the eight other surplus school site 
parcels sold since 1978, would cost 10 times what the district earned from the 
sales, Weintraub said. The Los Angeles district has received about $17.8 
million from the sale of 13 properties, which included an administrative office 
site and property in Northern California, district records show. 
</P>
<P>
The district by 1983 had sold most of its undeveloped properties, said Robert 
J. Niccum, the district's chief realty agent. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that in the long run, time will show that we would have been better 
off holding on to the property," Niccum said. "But it's easy to second-guess; 
at the time we had some very significant needs, and the money went to relieve 
overcrowded schools in other parts of the district." 
</P>
<P>
Though Korenstein said the district would need another school site because of 
the Porter Ranch development, Clarke said that question is still unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke said that Shapell could not have predicted in 1978 that West Valley 
schools, which were at less than capacity enrollments, would see dramatic 
growth in the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Shapell, of Beverly Hills, contributes heavily to state and local political 
campaigns and charitable causes. Last year, Shapell Industries had about $400 
million in sales of commercial and residential development.

PHOENIX HOUSE KILLS LAKE VIEW TERRACE DRUG CENTER PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Plans for a controversial drug treatment center in Lake View Terrace officially 
died Thursday when Phoenix House, the company behind the proposal, withdrew its 
application for a conditional use permit. 
</P>
<P>
The news was greeted warmly by opponents in the East Valley community. They had 
rejoiced when Nancy Reagan bowed out of the project on May 26, then despaired 
when Phoenix House asked the Los Angeles City Board of Zoning Appeals for a 
three-month extension on its permit hearing. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney representing Phoenix House at a June 20 hearing on the extension 
request had said there was still a remote chance the project would go forward. 
But Phoenix House officials said Thursday they only wanted more time to assess 
their finances. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$5.3 Million Raised 
</P>
<P>
Since the project was first made public more than a year ago, about $5.3 
million in money and pledges has been raised at various gala events attended by 
Nancy Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Policano, Phoenix House spokesman, said the company has determined 
that those donations were not tied to the Lake View Terrace site, which means 
the money can be used elsewhere. Policano said the company is searching for 
other possible center locations in Los Angeles County that would meet with Mrs. 
Reagan's approval. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very disappointed about this, but it's the end of a chapter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis Snow, vice president of the Lake View Terrace Home Owners Assn., said he 
knew the project was dead when Mrs. Reagan withdrew her support, saying she did 
not want to upset the community. Snow and other neighbors of the former 
hospital site had protested that the center would attract more drugs and crime 
to their streets and lower their property values. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Ready to Help' Other Neighborhoods 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy," said Lynne Cooper, president of the Lake View Terrace Improvement 
Assn. "That type of facility does not belong in a neighborhood, and if it tries 
to locate in one somewhere else, we'll be ready to help." 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix House officials have denied that the conditions the community feared 
had materialized near any of the company's 10 centers, which are in New York 
and California. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Reagan has never announced her intention to go forward with a Nancy Reagan 
Center in another location. Her spokesman, Mark Weinberg, said Thursday that he 
did not know whether she had decided to do so. Weinberg said Mrs. Reagan could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
As first described in the spring of 1988, the center was to have been the core 
of Mrs. Reagan's post-White House crusade against drugs. It was to have housed 
150 adolescents, 60 adults, training and research programs, and an office for 
Mrs. Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix House had hoped to have the center open when she returned from 
Washington in January but ran into delays, primarily caused by community 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-acre property reverts to a trustee who was appointed by a federal judge 
to oversee sale of the hospital after it declared bankruptcy in 1986. 
Councilman Ernani Bernardi, a frequent Phoenix House critic, has proposed that 
the city buy the property for use as a municipal senior center, library and 
recreation center.

WAGONERS' RIDE RAISES FUNDS ON ASPHALT TRAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven prairie schooners set sail Thursday from Moorpark with the same hope of 
hitting pay dirt as the Forty-Niners who poured into California during the gold 
rush of 1849. 
</P>
<P>
But the drivers of these horse- and mule-drawn wagons are not spending four 
days on the overland route to Camarillo to enrich themselves, but to raise 
funds for the Ventura County Arthritis Foundation. The event earns money by 
charging businesses about $400 apiece for ads on the sides of wagons, and by 
selling meals to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people get a thrill out of watching TV, but I just can't get with the 
program," said Dennis Blazewick, 50, an overall-clad retired Navy petty officer 
who trucked in two mules and a 124-year-old cart from Oroville for the annual 
event. "I guess I was just born 150 years too late." 
</P>
<P>
A Jack-of-all-trades, Blazewick is typical of the self-sufficient breed of 15 
to 25 wagoners and their families who have put up with heat, steep grades and 
traffic each year since 1979 to benefit the charity. For several members of the 
wagon train, the trip is a chance to relive the six-month Bicentennial trek 
they made across country to Valley Forge, Pa., where thousands of people 
gathered in 1976 to celebrate the nation's 200th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
For four days and nights, the Ventura County group plods along back roads and 
city streets past orange groves and office buildings, winding up Sunday at 
Freedom Park in Camarillo for a noon barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, the wagons rolled down Grimes Canyon Road -- three miles of 
switchbacks reminiscent of the mountain trails that the pioneers often had to 
use. 
</P>
<P>
"It was easier for the pioneers because they had dirt trails, and our iron 
wheels slip on the asphalt," said Linda Menary, 41, of Chatsworth as she 
struggled, white-knuckled, to rein in her team of two dappled horses as they 
skidded downhill. "Hit" and "Miss" reached level ground without damaging 
Menary's 100-year-old covered wagon. 
</P>
<P>
The train will pass through Ventura twice -- once on Friday as it travels 
westward and northward toward Oak View and again on Sunday on the way to 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
But this year may mark the group's last journey because the city of Ventura, 
claiming the train causes traffic problems, is charging the wagons about $1,000 
for a parade permit. Other law enforcement agencies, such as the California 
Highway Patrol, which assigned two officers Thursday to shepherd the train from 
Moorpark to Santa Paula, escort the group for free. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue here is they want to stay together as a procession and that will 
have a tremendous impact on traffic," said Capt. Ken Thompson of the Ventura 
Police Department. "We don't provide such services for free anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Faye McDonald, executive director of the Ventura County Arthritis Foundation, 
said the fee probably will force the charity to cancel the event. She said the 
train could not avoid the city, because the charity's offices are located there 
and because it is the county seat. 
</P>
<P>
Although volunteers donated 3,300 hours to organize the event last year, the 
train only raised about $7,800, McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
"The beauty of the train up until now has been the low overhead," McDonald 
said. "It's sad it will end because it is such a colorful event."

PLAN TO EXTEND METRO RAIL GAINS SUPPORT; 
</P>
<P>
BUSINESS, HOMEOWNER, JEWISH LEADERS CALL IT ACCEPTABLE COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Legislation that would force transit officials to extend the downtown-to-North 
Hollywood Metro Rail line partly underground through the east San Fernando 
Valley to Encino picked up support Thursday, but some opposition remains. 
</P>
<P>
The Metro Rail plan, offered two months ago as an alternative to a 
controversial proposal to extend light rail across the Valley on the so-called 
Chandler-Victory route, was endorsed at a meeting in Van Nuys by Valley 
business leaders, two homeowner leaders and representatives of a North 
Hollywood orthodox Jewish community that fought all previous plans. 
</P>
<P>
Those endorsing the plan said it did not give them all they wanted but was an 
acceptable compromise. But a leading opponent dismissed the plan as 
"divide-and-conquer legislation" that weakened homeowners along the route by 
splitting the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Because Metro Rail is far more costly than ground-level light rail, the plan's 
sponsors, state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana) and Los Angeles City Councilman 
Marvin Braude, acknowledge that there will be only enough money to extend the 
line from North Hollywood to Encino. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Robbins and Braude envision passengers traveling to the West 
Valley and transferring to express buses at a station that would be built in 
the Sepulveda Basin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
One Voice 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, who has spent weeks drumming up support for the plan, said: "For the 
first time in years, much of the Valley is speaking with one voice on the 
question of rail. We should be able to move swiftly with this bill." 
</P>
<P>
The Robbins-Braude plan utilizes the Southern Pacific railroad right of way 
that follows Chandler Boulevard, Oxnard Street and Victory Boulevard between 
North Hollywood and Encino. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the remaining opposition centers on the fact that while the plan would 
require that the top of the subway tunnel be at least 25 feet below ground 
between Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Woodman Avenue, it would allow transit 
officials more leeway elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Between the Hollywood Freeway and Laurel Canyon and between Woodman and 
Hazeltine Avenue, the trains must be below ground but there would be no depth 
requirement and the line could be covered only by a grate. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Paterson, president of the Valley Village Homeowners Assn., said that while 
homeowners, synagogues and orthodox Jewish community centers between Laurel 
Canyon and Woodman would be protected from noise and ground vibrations, "other 
areas are also residential, and they would be treated as second-class 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Herman, who heads the Eastern Sector Transit Coalition, which has organized 
crowds of opponents at hearings on Valley rail proposals, said: "We see no 
reason why the entire route should not be a deep-bore subway." 
</P>
<P>
But Kurt Hunter, president of the North Hollywood Homeowner Assn. and one of 
those endorsing the Robbins-Braude plan Thursday, said: "At some point, you 
have to take the best deal you can get and get this much-needed project going." 
</P>
<P>
In the same vein, David Fleming, president of the Valley Industry and Commerce 
Assn., said his group would like to see a line that goes all the way to 
fast-growing Warner Center, but "all of us here today are saying that we are 
willing to settle for the possible. I think this is an historic occasion." 
</P>
<P>
Also remaining opposed is the Western Sector Transit Coalition, a 
well-organized group of homeowners living west of Encino, along the Southern 
Pacific route in Reseda and Woodland Hills, where the tracks follow Topham 
Street and Victory Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Transportation Commission, which is building a 
countywide network of rail lines, has determined that there is a strong need 
for an east-west line in the Valley. Commissioners have indicated a willingness 
to build the line along any feasible route that meets widespread support in the 
Valley.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CHATSWORTH MAN GETS 8 YEARS IN FATAL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A27-year old Chatsworth man was sentenced to eight years in prison Thursday for 
fatally shooting a man during an argument. 
</P>
<P>
Zeferino Rosales Leon pleaded guilty in April to first-degree manslaughter in 
the death of Ignacio Gomez, 26. Leon originally was charged with murder, but 
that charge was dismissed when he agreed to plead to the lesser crime. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez died of medical complications from the bullet wound on May 18, 1988 -- 
more than six weeks after the shooting took place. 
</P>
<P>
During the sentencing, Public Defender Jerry M. Schultz pleaded with San 
Fernando Superior Court Judge Meredith Taylor not to give Leon the maximum 
13-year sentence, arguing that Gomez's death was caused as much by medical 
negligence as by Leon's actions. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, Gomez was released from Northridge Hospital 
Medical Center less than a week after the shooting. A month later, he returned 
to the hospital, complaining of discomfort and was referred to the Los Angeles 
County-USC Medical Center, where he died.

EX-BOYFRIEND EXTORTED $15,000 FROM HER, WOMAN, 71, TESTIFIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
A 71-year-old Sylmar woman testified Thursday that she gave her former 
boyfriend $15,000 because she believed that a Colombian terrorist organization 
would kill him and members of her family. 
</P>
<P>
Suletta Watters said during a preliminary hearing in San Fernando Municipal 
Court that she gave Richard Ramirez, 68, of Burbank $5,000 on three occasions 
after he delivered threatening letters that demanded money to support a 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
The unsigned letters led Watters to believe that Ramirez was merely a messenger 
for the terrorist group and would be killed if she did not give him money, 
Watters testified. 
</P>
<P>
"Life is in jeopardy," one letter threatened. "He who disobeys suffers the 
consequences, which will be the violent death of your loved ones." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Blood in Texas' 
</P>
<P>
Another letter said it was Watters' obligation "to help the revolutionary 
peoples" and threatened "blood in Texas," where her brother and other relatives 
live, if she did not comply with the demand for money. It also said the life of 
her "symbolic husband" was in danger. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez was ordered to stand trial on three counts of extortion and one count 
of attempted extortion. If convicted of all the charges, he faces a maximum of 
16 years in prison. Ramirez is in county jail in lieu of $75,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
Watters said that after he delivered the letters, Ramirez called her to arrange 
meetings when she gave him the money. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said that this was not the first time that Watters gave Ramirez 
money. Watters supported Ramirez for 15 years, paying him $90,000 in living 
expenses, after the two met at the company where Watters was a publications 
editor and Ramirez was a security guard, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jacquelyn P. 
Lacey. 
</P>
<P>
Watters fell in love with Ramirez, Lacey said, and he told her that he would 
marry her after he received $1 million from an estate settlement that was in 
litigation in Colombia. But in the interim, Watters complied with his request 
for money for living expenses, giving him a stipend of $500 a month during the 
15 years, Lacey said. She also gave him large sums, which he told her he needed 
to pay for an operation and for attorneys in Colombia, Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Broke Off Relationship 
</P>
<P>
Watters broke off the relationship in 1986. She received the first letter 
asking for $5,000 in September, 1988. She complied with that and with a second 
letter demanding two separate payments of $5,000. A third letter, which she 
received on June 6, demanded two payments of $10,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
Watters was prepared to comply with the third letter, Lacey said, but to get 
the money from the bank, she had to tell a relative who called the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
Ramirez was arrested June 22 after police who searched his house discovered 
several blue envelopes with rose emblems on the back. The distinctive envelopes 
were the same type of envelopes in which the extortion letters had been 
delivered, Lacey said.

YANKEES HOMER, BUNT, STEAL TO DEFEAT TIGERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Yankees are known for hitting home runs, not for bunting and 
stealing bases. 
</P>
<P>
They did all three Thursday and rallied in the 11th inning to beat Detroit, 
6-5, and move above .500 for the first time since May 12. 
</P>
<P>
"That was one of the biggest games of the year for us," said Steve Sax, who hit 
the game-winning sacrifice fly. "There was something different about this game. 
It was kind of out there for either team to grab." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Righetti blew a 4-3 lead in the ninth inning, allowing doubles to Gary 
Ward and Alan Trammell. Detroit took the lead in the top of the 11th when Lou 
Whitaker, who has never hit more than 21 homers, hit his 18th, off Eric Plunk, 
3-1. 
</P>
<P>
But Jesse Barfield led off the bottom of the 11th with his first home run since 
June 8, a line shot to right off Mike Henneman, 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
"It's about time I came through in a situation like that," said Barfield, who 
is just 8 for 44 with runners in scoring position since the Yankees acquired 
him from Toronto. "I've left my quota of runners on base. I've squandered my 
share of chances." 
</P>
<P>
Pagliarulo then checked his swing on a forkball and blooped the ball into short 
left field for a double. 
</P>
<P>
"It was perfect placement," Pagliarulo joked. "I practice that in BP." 
</P>
<P>
Don Slaught was intentionally walked and Alvaro Espinoza executed a perfect 
sacrifice. Roberto Kelly was walked intentionally, loading the bases, and Sax 
flied to medium right. 
</P>
<P>
"I had some butterflies," said Sax, 14 for 28 against Detroit this season with 
seven runs-batted in. "I tried to get a real loose grip on the bat. If I try to 
muscle it, I'm going to pop it up. Just sting it." 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees, 42-41, had not been over .500 since they were 17-16. They have not 
been two games over this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It looked like it was gonna slip away from us," Yankee Manager Dallas Green 
said. "It was a good, bear-down win for us." 
</P>
<P>
Detroit, on the other hand, dropped to 31-51, losing its seventh straight game 
in Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're losing, things go against you and things pile up," Tigers manager 
Sparky Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Yankees took a 4-3 lead with two runs in the fifth. Kelly walked, stole 
second and scored on Sax's double. Sax then stole third and scored on Luis 
Polonia's groundout. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't the big home-run type of Yankees lineup that people are used to 
seeing," Sax said. "There weren't many big homers but there were doubles up the 
gap and down the line." 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Clay Parker, New York's most effective starter this season, gave up 
seven hits and one earned run in six innings and almost got the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt out of synch," he said. "I let too many little things bother me. Every 
inning, it's tough to do, get out of those situations. There's no excuse for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Lee Guetterman pitched two shutout innings before Righetti took over. He wound 
up blowing his fifth save in 20 opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Schu's sacrifice fly gave Detroit a 1-0 lead in the second, but New York 
tied it in the bottom of the inning on Pagliarulo's fourth home run. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit went back ahead in the fourth on Ward's sacrifice fly and Trammell's 
RBI infield hit.

CUB HOMERS BAIL OUT MADDUX IN 7-3 VICTORY

What a difference a year is making for Greg Maddux. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, he was was 15-3 at the All-Star break. On Thursday, Maddux (8-7) 
struggled for six innings, but got three home runs from his Cub teammates en 
route to a 7-3 win over the San Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
"It was no secret, I was all over the place today," Maddux said. "I'd be the 
first one to say I didn't pitch well. They didn't really get a big hit either." 
</P>
<P>
Maddux walked the bases loaded in the third inning, but escaped with no runs. 
He also got out of a bases-loaded jam in the sixth." 
</P>
<P>
"I was just lucky not to give up a double with the bases loaded in either of 
the third or sixth innings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ryne Sandberg and Andre Dawson hit seventh inning home runs and Shawon Dunston 
homered in the eighth as the Cubs swept a three-game series from San Diego for 
the first time at Wrigley Field since July 1987. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first three-homer game for the Cubs since June 11 against St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Walt Terrell (4-12) lost his seventh consecutive game for the Padres, allowing 
five hits and four runs in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
Mitch Williams earned his 21st save and the 30th for the team this season, one 
more than all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Maddux said he's happy with his first-half performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I've kept my team in all but two of the 18 games I've pitched, and if I can 
keep my team in the game for six or seven innings, then I feel I've done my 
job," Maddux said. 
</P>
<P>
Cub Manager Don Zimmer said Maddux "was all goofed up. He had nothing going for 
him. Being the competitor he is, he got through six innings. That's the most 
important thing, and he's not going to pitch many games like that." 
</P>
<P>
Padre Manager Jack McKeon, was upset his team allowed the sweep. 
</P>
<P>
"Once again, we failed to come up with a big hit with men in scoring position," 
McKeon said. "We've been through this before. We're not going to pack up our 
tents and go home." 
</P>
<P>
Outside of Marvell Wynne's three-run home run on Wednesday and Wynne's 
run-scoring single Thursday, McKeon said, "there was not too much to cheer 
about." 
</P>
<P>
Sandberg led of the seventh inning with his 11th homer off reliever Fred 
Tolliver and Dawson got his eighth homer one out later, giving Chicago a 6-3 
lead. It was Dawson's 12th homer in 31 games against the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
A three-run second inning keyed by Dunston's run-scoring single and two errors 
by shortstop Bip Roberts started the Cubs on their way to their seventh victory 
in eight games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Maddux allowed seven hits and three runs for the Cubs, who are now are 30-7 in 
the last six seasons against San Diego at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
Maddux was replaced by Steve Wilson after allowing a single to Chris James and 
a walk to Roberts to start the seventh. James later scored on Tony Gwynn's 
infield out and Marvell Wynne's single scored Roberts, cutting Chicago's lead 
to 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
But the seventh-inning homers by Sandberg and Dawson, plus Dunston's homer in 
the eighth, put the Cubs back in control. 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Alomar's double, his 19th stolen base and Carmelo Martinez's sacrifice 
fly gave the Padres a 1-0 lead in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Cubs bounced back in their half of the second, getting three runs after 
Terrell walked Damon Berryhill and Vance Law. Dunston singled home Berryhill, 
tying the score, before Roberts' errors allowed two more runs to score. 
</P>
<P>
Dwight Smith's RBI double gave Chicago a 4-1 lead in the third.

EVERT SHOWN THE WAY OUT IN SEMIFINAL; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER HER 6-2, 6-1 LOSS TO GRAF, A LAST WAVE FROM CENTRE COURT

<TEXT>
<P>
At 12 minutes past 3 on a humid Thursday afternoon, Chris Evert sat in a green 
chair at the side of Centre Court and looked around one last time. 
</P>
<P>
She took off her wristband and packed it in her bag. Then she put her racket 
inside, zipped up the bag, toweled herself off and slipped into a white jacket. 
</P>
<P>
A curtsy, a wave and a wry smile to her family sitting in the stands, and Evert 
was gone. 
</P>
<P>
In 1 hour 8 minutes of tennis, an era passed at Wimbledon, where Evert is not 
likely to play again. 
</P>
<P>
It was a graceful, but not unexpected, exit for the 34-year-old Evert, ushered 
forcefully off the grass courts by Steffi Graf, who scored a 6-2, 6-1 semifinal 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Next for Graf, the preeminent force in women's tennis, is Martina Navratilova, 
who has shared the era with Evert and may also share her fate in the final. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova fought a swirling wind and Catarina Lindqvist of Sweden in her 
semifinal match before beating them both, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
There will be another day for Navratilova at Wimbledon, but almost certainly 
not for Evert. Afterward, she said she is 90% sure her Wimbledon career is 
over. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be shocked if I came back and played this tournament next year," Evert 
said. "I don't know, it would take a transplant or something." 
</P>
<P>
What kind of transplant? 
</P>
<P>
"Here," Evert said, tapping her forehead. 
</P>
<P>
Evert did not go out quietly against Graf, although the score indicated little 
resistence. There were a few chances for Evert to make the score closer but not 
to change the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
Down a break in the first set, she held three break points for 2-4, but Graf 
saved them all. At 0-1 in the second set, Evert missed another break point and 
blew two more break points for 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Graf offered no more opportunities. She held at 30 for 5-1 and aced 
Evert on game point. In what was the last game of the match, Graf broke Evert 
for the fifth and final time. 
</P>
<P>
This was neither the kind of tennis Evert had played when younger, nor the kind 
that Graf had seen early in their rivalry. Evert won their first six meetings, 
but now Graf has won eight straight. 
</P>
<P>
"For one thing, which was a little bit different, usually (in the past) she 
knew what to do on the big points and she had more experience and everything," 
Graf said. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) today there were a lot of close games, and I was down a couple of break 
points and I always managed to get those points. That's where her strength 
usually was and what has become more or less my strength now." 
</P>
<P>
On the second match point, Evert double-faulted. That is not the best way to 
end 18 years at Wimbledon, but Evert certainly enjoyed many other moments. 
</P>
<P>
She won the title three times -- in 1974, 1976 and 1981. From Evert's first 
match in 1972, a three-set victory over Valerie Ziegenfuss, to her defeat 
Thursday, Evert's Wimbledon record is 96-15. 
</P>
<P>
In 18 years at Wimbledon, Evert reached the final 10 times. Graf made sure that 
Evert had only a small chance of getting there again. 
</P>
<P>
"She's so quick and she's so strong, and obviously that's why she's No. 1," 
Evert said. "She was just a lot better than I was today -- today and every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
There may be no more days for Evert to send eerily efficient two-fisted 
backhands into the deepest corner of grass on Centre Court. Maybe that's why 
she waved as she did while she walked away. It was not something Evert usually 
does. It seemed to be a wave goodby. 
</P>
<P>
Billie Jean King once told Evert that she had made a conscious effort to do 
something special to savor the moment of her last match on the most famous 
court in tennis, and Evert seemed to be imitating the symbol of the era before 
hers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of things were going through my head," Evert said. "It could be my last 
time, you know, on Centre Court. And just that, you know -- Centre Court is the 
greatest court in the world, and I'll always remember it. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that the older I got, the more it meant to me to play on Centre Court 
and to play Wimbledon. You know, when you're young, I always knew in the back 
of my mind I had time on my side. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think the last few years, I think I've really kind of looked around a 
little bit more and realized that isn't going to be around me for much longer. 
You know, it's not in my future plans. And sometimes you appreciate things a 
little more when you get older." 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova, two years younger than Evert, hasn't played Graf since losing to 
her in last year's Wimbledon final. In getting there again, Navratilova had 
little trouble with the unseeded Lindqvist after winning the first-set 
tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
A change of tactics helped. Navratilova stopped chipping service returns on her 
backhand and began swinging through the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Lindqvist, the first Swedish woman to play in a Wimbledon semifinal, led the 
tiebreaker, 5-4, but lost her serve twice, and Navratilova closed it out with a 
service winner. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova, seeded second, lost only two points on her serve in the second 
set, and both were on double faults. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, maybe the biggest problem Navratilova had during the match was 
swallowing. Saliva stuck in her throat and caused her a few anxious moments. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just breathing and it went down the wrong hole," Navratilova said. "My 
stomach was a mess, tears running down my face, I thought, 'What else can 
happen to me on Centre Court?' 
</P>
<P>
"I've been through it all. I've been hit in the head by a ball, I've whiffed a 
ball, my shirt fell off. I was just walking and all of a sudden I can't 
breathe. I was just a mess." 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova said it's difficult for her to think about a Wimbledon without 
Evert. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1976, Navratilova and Evert have played nine matches at Wimbledon, 
and Navratilova won seven times. They met in five finals, and Navratilova won 
them all. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't really fathom that because we have been going at it for so long that a 
piece of me would be gone with her that's tucked away, that only she and I 
share," Navratilova said. "That will always be there though, regardless of 
whether she's playing or not." 
</P>
<P>
For Evert, there was a feeling of relief at having lived up to her fourth 
seeding, as well as the realization that there could be no disgrace in losing 
to the top-seeded player. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought after the match, after a couple of those rallies, 'Boy, if I was 10 
years younger,' " Evert said. 
</P>
<P>
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
The top two U.S. doubles teams won their quarterfinal matches and headed toward 
a possible showdown in the final. The No. 1-seeded team of Rick Leach and Jim 
Pugh defeated Darren Cahill and Mark Kratzmann of Australia, 3-6, 7-5, 4-6, 
6-1, 6-3. Second-seeded Ken Flach and Robert Seguso beat Pieter Aldrich and 
Danie Visser of South Africa, 6-7 (7-5), 6-3, 6-2, 7-5. . . . Next for Leach 
and Pugh are Javier Frana of Argentina and Leonardo Lavalle of Mexico. Flach 
and Seguso will play the third-seeded team of John Fitzgerald of Australia and 
Anders Jarryd of Sweden. "We're staying mentally stable because it's all fresh 
for us," Leach said. "We really haven't been through this before." Leach and 
Pugh lost in the round of 16 last year.

In the center of the storm was Jim Finks, general manager of the New Orleans 
Saints, who, as the only candidate yet nominated, is still in the running for 
an office that the league expects to fill at a later meeting this summer . 
</P>
<P>
When they refused to vote him in, the dissidents seemed to be shooting not at 
Finks, but at the old-line owners who backed him. 
</P>
<P>
As Hugh Culverhouse, president of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, said the other day, 
the NFL's newer owners have been outraged lately by what they called the 
high-handed tactics of the league's old guard. 
</P>
<P>
At a stormy six-hour meeting, the representatives of 27 NFL clubs took only two 
ballots on Finks, both secret, and got the same count each time, 16 ayes and 11 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
To elect a commissioner, 19 votes are required. 
</P>
<P>
Ram owner Georgia Frontiere's representative, John Shaw, was one of the 11 who 
abstained from voting for the nominee. 
</P>
<P>
Raider owner Al Davis voted for Finks. 
</P>
<P>
The four leaders of the dissidents are Culverhouse, Norman Braman, Edward 
DeBartolo Jr. and Mike Lynn. The last three are the presidents of, 
respectively, the Philadelphia Eagles, the San Francisco 49ers and the 
Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
The ownerships of all four clubs are comparatively new, as time is measured in 
the 70-year-old NFL. Others voting with the dissidents were the new owners of 
the Denver Broncos, the Seattle Seahawks, the New England Patriots and the 
Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Frontiere, the owners of two other old-line teams, Joe Robbie of 
the Miami Dolphins and Robert Irsay of the Indianapolis Colts, lined up against 
Finks. 
</P>
<P>
But their stands were not a surprise. Frontiere often votes with Culverhouse. 
The other two, Robbie and Irsay, are considered independents rather than 
old-guard regulars. 
</P>
<P>
Braman, taking charge of the dissidents in the absence of Culverhouse, said the 
group spent most of the day in meetings here ahead of the NFL session that 
began at 4:30 p.m., CDT. 
</P>
<P>
"We considered boycotting the session," he said. "But at the last minute, we 
decided to attend." 
</P>
<P>
Rozelle had stepped in as peacemaker. Informed at 3:30 by a petition from the 
dissidents that they weren't ready to vote for a commissioner, he persuaded 
them to come down and make their case in person. 
</P>
<P>
The establishment people could have gotten a 17th aye, if necessary, from the 
absent owner of the Houston Oilers, Bud Adams, but that would still have left 
them two votes shy. 
</P>
<P>
"No other candidates were nominated," Braman said. "This wasn't that kind of 
meeting." 
</P>
<P>
Asked when the owners will convene again, Art Modell, president of the 
Cleveland Browns, said: "Sometime this summer on seven days' notice from the 
commissioner." 
</P>
<P>
The dissidents had objected that they had only six days' notice this time and 
that four of those days were over a national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
This was one of their many objections. The others included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- First, three months ago, they had made a strong protest against the 
membership of the search committee, which is exclusively staffed by old guard 
members and headed by Wellington Mara of the New York Giants and Lamar Hunt of 
the Kansas City Chiefs. The newer owners had wanted at least one of theirs on 
the committee, but the old guard failed to oblige. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Second, the rebels had expected a slate of three or four candidates. The 
committee came up with only one. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And third, that candidate turned out to be a favorite of the old guard, 
Finks, who has spent the last three decades working with long-established NFL 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
All this was too much for the dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
Said Rozelle: "Their main concern was (this) process. No criticism of Finks was 
expressed by anyone." 
</P>
<P>
Hunt agreed. Said the Kansas City owner of his hand-picked candidate: "Jim is 
very much alive when we (vote again at the next meeting). I spoke with him a 
few minutes ago, and he's still very much interested in the job." 
</P>
<P>
Whether the search committee will nominate further candidates at the next 
meeting is still uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"Finks is our candidate," Hunt said, speaking for the committee. "We were for 
him unanimously going in, and we still feel that way." 
</P>
<P>
Whether this point of view will be satisfactory to the rebels was in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
They seem ready to take charge of the league, if they can, unless the older 
owners pay more attention to their wishes and demands. 
</P>
<P>
The rupture is the most serious in the history of a league whose members have 
often enough disagreed in other years -- but never before brought the machinery 
to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
What's different now is the cost of the franchises. When the older clubs -- the 
Chicago Bears, the Giants, the Green Bay Packers, the Browns and the others -- 
came in, their owners paid little to enter pro football. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the eight owners who have joined in the 1980s paid up to $100 
million apiece. And even in the late '70s, franchise prices were staggering in 
contrast with those of the 1960s and earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The new gang is of the opinion that the old guys aren't sufficiently interested 
in their problems, which are to a large extent financial. Most of them put up 
many millions and borrowed many millions more to become NFL owners, and their 
debt structures prompt them to look at most NFL problems in a different way. 
</P>
<P>
They're angry that the established owners don't understand this -- but until 
just a few hours ago, that anger was mostly misdirected. Indeed, the rebels 
lacked leadership as recently as last week, except for Culverhouse, and they 
lacked any semblance of organization as well. 
</P>
<P>
Mainly, most of the new owners have been too busy in their own businesses to 
work up any NFL plots. 
</P>
<P>
The difference Thursday was that Braman finally got them organized, and the NFL 
may never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
Voting with the old guard were two new owners, Alex Spanos of the San Diego 
Chargers and Tom Benson of the Saints. Spanos often votes with the Raiders' 
Davis. Benson defected because he liked the idea of having his own man, Finks, 
in the commissioner's office. 
</P>
<P>
The other teams that voted the establishment way were the six from which the 
search committee was chosen -- the Giants, the Chiefs, the Browns, the Packers, 
the Buffalo Bills and the Pittsburgh Steelers -- plus the Washington Redskins, 
the Bears, the Detroit Lions, the Phoenix Cardinals, the Atlanta Falcons, the 
Cincinnati Bengals and the New York Jets.

AZINGER, GILDER, KNOX SHARE LEAD WITH 65S

Rain-softened greens plus mild winds added up to low scores as Paul Azinger, 
Bob Gilder and Kenny Knox shared a one-stroke lead in Thursday's first round of 
the $1-million Greater Hartford Open at Cromwell, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Each shot a six-under-par 65 on the 6,786-yard course. Five players were tied 
at 66, 11 more at 67. 
</P>
<P>
The already easy Tournament Players Club of Connecticut layout was even less 
challenging than normal after showers Wednesday. Balls rarely rolled far from 
where they landed, and golfers could putt aggressively with little fear of 
badly overshooting the cup. 
</P>
<P>
The light breeze provided some relief from the high humidity but had little 
effect on shots. Skies were cloudy most of the day but there was no rain. 
</P>
<P>
"This is absolutely as easy as a golf course can play," said Roger Maltbie, who 
shot a 66. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-two players broke par 71 on a course where four of the last five 
tournament winners shot 15-under-par 269 for four rounds. 
</P>
<P>
One stroke behind the leaders were Brian Tennyson, Ronnie Black, Jim Carter, 
Clark Burroughs and Maltbie, the first-round leader last year with a 64. 
</P>
<P>
Mark McNulty of Zimbabwe and Australian Peter Senior shared the lead at 132 
after the second round of the $450,000 Monte Carlo Open in Monaco. 
</P>
<P>
Senior shot a three-under-par 66, while McNulty had a 64. 
</P>
<P>
Spain's Severiano Ballesteros shot a 67 but missed the cut with a 142, four 
over par.

ALL-STAR GAME FLASHBACK; 
</P>
<P>
RIGHT THERE WITH THE BEST; 
</P>
<P>
FRED LYNN'S 1983 GRAND SLAM MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN RUTHIAN, BUT IT WAS CLOSE 
ENOUGH TO LAND IN THE HISTORY BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You come to Fred Lynn seeking knowledge about the one and only grand slam hit 
in baseball's All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
You know Lynn delivered it in 1983, at Chicago's Comiskey Park, while he was 
with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
You let Lynn take care of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Leaning back in a chair in front of his Tiger Stadium locker, Lynn can tell you 
anything you want to know about the blast that earned him the 
most-valuable-player award in the 50th anniversary All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
He remembers the inning: the third. 
</P>
<P>
He remembers the count: 1 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
He remembers the pitcher: Atlee Hammaker. 
</P>
<P>
He remembers the pitch: hanging slider. 
</P>
<P>
But most of all, Lynn remembers where the first grand slam in All-Star history 
landed. 
</P>
<P>
Right next to where the first home run in All-Star history had landed. 
</P>
<P>
"They played the first All-Star game at Comiskey, and (Babe) Ruth hit the first 
home run," Lynn says. "They showed me where he hit it. Mine was about five 
seats from it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of weird. His was the first home run, mine was the first grand slam 
and mine almost landed right where he hit his." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn smiles, preparing his listener for the punch line. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess," he finally says, "that means I have Ruthian power." 
</P>
<P>
Five decades and five bleacher seats apart, the home runs live on as two of the 
American League's proudest All-Star moments. Ruth's ground-breaker, a two-run 
homer, provided the American League with the margin of victory in a 4-2 win 
over the National League in the 1933 inaugural game. Lynn's slam, the key blow 
in a 13-3 American League triumph, broke a string of 11 consecutive All-Star 
victories by the National League. 
</P>
<P>
"That was my ninth game and I hadn't won one yet," Lynn recalls. "It was 
getting pretty tiring. We'd had some tough losses, some extra-inning losses. 
</P>
<P>
"It was big that we won that one, but it was bigger still because we blew them 
out. After that, the mystique about 'the National League jinx' was broken. 
Since then, we've won our share of games." 
</P>
<P>
But at the outset, the 1983 game had the look of another AL disaster. The 
American Leaguers committed two errors in the first inning, including one by 
Angel first baseman Rod Carew, who failed to catch a throw from Toronto pitcher 
Dave Stieb and later said he lost the ball in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh my gosh," Lynn remembers thinking. "Here we go again." 
</P>
<P>
But Stieb got out of the inning by striking out Andre Dawson, Dale Murphy and 
Mike Schmidt and by the third, the American League actually led, 2-1, courtesy 
of a throwing error by Dodger second baseman Steve Sax. 
</P>
<P>
By the fourth, that lead read 9-1, with Hammaker laboring through what he 
called "probably the worst exhibition of pitching you'll ever see." 
</P>
<P>
Boston's Jim Rice opened the bottom of the third with a home run. Carew singled 
in another run. And by the time Milwaukee shortstop Robin Yount, the league's 
most valuable player the year before, stepped up to the plate, the American 
League had two more runners in scoring position -- Cleveland's Manny Trillo at 
third base and Carew at second. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, National League Manager Whitey Herzog instructed Hammaker to 
walk Yount, loading the bases for Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
Kneeling on the on-deck circle, Lynn admitted to seeing red. 
</P>
<P>
"Just because it was the right move strategically doesn't mean I have to like 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, worse still, he saw Morganna. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, there she was -- Morganna Roberts, baseball's incorrigible Kissing Bandit, 
in the ever-so-slightly clad flesh. 
</P>
<P>
She had ambushed Lynn in Anaheim Stadium a month earlier and now she was 
bounding across the Comiskey Park outfield, seeking another target before 
security guards could intercept her and escort her from the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew she wasn't coming after me again," Lynn said after the game, "but I put 
my bats up in the sign of the cross. I'm not superstitious, but I believe in 
playing it safe." 
</P>
<P>
Superstitious? Lynn? Just because he had gone four for 56, one of the worst 
slumps of his career, after his first encounter with Miss Morganna? 
</P>
<P>
Finally, order was restored and Hammaker completed the intentional walk to 
Yount. The bases were loaded. The National League, at long last, was on the 
ropes. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn dug in and, for the fourth time in his All-Star career, sent a baseball 
over the outfield fences. History was made and the rout was on. 
</P>
<P>
Herzog and Hammaker should have seen it coming. If only they had paid closer 
attention to the American League's batting practice session. With one of his 
warmup swings, Lynn hit a pitch onto Comiskey Park's roof, a titanic shot. 
</P>
<P>
Glen Rosenbaum, the Chicago White Sox batting practice pitcher, was stunned. 
</P>
<P>
"Bet there haven't been four or five hits like that off me," Rosenbaum said. "I 
know the Bull (Greg Luzinski) hit one once, but I can't remember the others." 
</P>
<P>
So, Lynn was ready. Soon, an Angel was about to go where no other All-Star -- 
not Ruth, not Gehrig, not Mantle, not Mays -- had ever gone before. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn, now a 37-year-old outfielder-designated hitter for the Detroit Tigers, 
ranks the slam among the greatest moments of his 15-year career. 
</P>
<P>
"It was big," he says. "All-Star games are a lot of fun and I've had some 
success in them -- four home runs. My only regret is not having the chance to 
go for Stan Musial's record of six." 
</P>
<P>
Lynn hasn't been back to the All-Star game since 1983. The time to catch Musial 
has probably passed him by. 
</P>
<P>
But for one summer night, with one swing of the bat, Fred Lynn was right there 
with Babe Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn can tell you about it.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;

<P>
YANKEES DON'T NEED BREAK AFTER BEATING TIGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Yankees may not want to see the All-Star break. After struggling 
for half a season, they seem finally ready to make a run at the Baltimore 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the Yankees have had mostly rough times. There have been 
numerous roster changes, slumps by stars such as Don Mattingly and pitching 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Almost the only constant has been Steve Sax. The former Dodger, who signed with 
the Yankees as a free agent, has been a steady, sometimes outstanding, 
performer. He has done his part to keep the Yankees afloat. 
</P>
<P>
Sax celebrated his selection to the American League All-Star team by hitting a 
sacrifice fly in the 11th inning Thursday in New York to give the Yankees a 6-5 
victory over the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third victory in a row for the Yankees and put them over .500 for 
the first time in nearly two months. 
</P>
<P>
With the Orioles losing at Toronto, the New York cut Baltimore's lead in the 
East to 5 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
The woeful Tigers, who have lost four in a row, had taken their third lead of 
the game in the top of the inning when Lou Whitaker hit his 18th home run. But 
Jesse Barfield homered off Mike Henneman (5-2), an All-Star selection, to tie 
it again. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Pagliarulo hit a bloop double to keep the rally going. A sacrifice and two 
intentional walks brought up Sax, a .319 hitter. Sax delivered a line drive to 
left field, and it was all over. 
</P>
<P>
"This was one of the biggest games of the year," Sax said. "There was something 
different about it. It was kind of out there for either team to grab. 
</P>
<P>
"We are showing signs of being ready to make a move. While I'm honored to be 
selected for Tuesday's game, it isn't coming at a good time for us. We finally 
have some momentum." 
</P>
<P>
Sax, who had four hits in Wednesday's win over the Tigers, is 14 for 28 against 
Detroit this season. 
</P>
<P>
It was the seventh straight loss for the Tigers at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Sparky Anderson, seemingly accepting the fact that this season isn't 
going to get better for his cellar club, tried to be philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're losing," he said, "things go against you and things pile up." 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 4, Baltimore 1 -- Fred McGriff, somewhat miffed that he wasn't chosen 
for the All-Star game, took it out on the Orioles at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
McGriff hit a three-run home run, his 20th homer, off Jeff Ballard in the third 
inning to end the Orioles' three-game winning streak and give Todd Stottlemyre 
his first victory. 
</P>
<P>
Stottlemyre, who has lost four games, gave up four hits and struck out five in 
six innings. 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Duane Ward got the last nine outs for the Blue Jays, six on 
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland 3, Kansas City 1 -- Mike Moore, chosen for the All-Star Game for the 
first time, showed the Royals why he deserved the honor in the game at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
The big right-hander struck out 12 and gave up only four hits in seven innings 
to improve his record to 11-5. The Royals, who battered Oakland pitching for 22 
runs in the previous two games, did not get a hit until two were out in the 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Moore struck out Bo Jackson with two out in the sixth and fanned Bill Buckner 
in a similar situation in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Mark McGwire drove in two runs for the Athletics and has 55 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Burns pitched the last two innings and didn't give up a hit. However, a 
walk to Jackson in the eighth led to the Royals' only run. Burns earned his 
sixth save. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 5, Milwaukee 4 -- Mike Boddicker retired the first 15 Brewers at Boston, 
then couldn't get out of the sixth inning. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn Braggs opened the sixth with a hit to end the string, and Boddicker (6-7) 
had to be bailed out by Wes Gardner after giving up two runs with just one out. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Boggs went three for three for the Red Sox. He is six for eight in the 
last two games and has raised his average to .330. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll take the win," Boddicker said. "I wasn't even thinking no-hitter. I'm 
going to give up hits. There's not much chance I'll throw a no-hitter." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 7, Minnesota 5 -- After going 0 for 33 in games when they trailed after 
seven innings, the Mariners pulled one out at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Darnell Coles hit a two-run single off Jeff Reardon in the eighth inning, and 
Seattle overcame a 5-4 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Jackson won it in relief and Mike Schooler earned his 20th save in 23 
opportunities.

BLYLEVEN AND DOWNING GET PASSED OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A couple of veterans with good numbers were passed over, but the Angels' new 
wave made a big splash Thursday when the American League All-Star pitchers and 
reserves were announced. 
</P>
<P>
Left-hander Chuck Finley, who is 10-6 with a 2.24 earned-run average, and 
center fielder Devon White, who took a .260 batting average with nine home runs 
and 37 runs batted in into Thursday night's game, will make their first 
appearance in All-Star competition Tuesday night at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Bert Blyleven (7-2), who has a league-leading 2.16 ERA, and designated hitter 
Brian Downing, who had a .310 average, eight homers and 31 RBIs going into 
Thursday night's game, were left off the squad. Finley and White are both 26; 
Blyleven and Downing are both 38. 
</P>
<P>
Finley leads the staff in wins and is second in the AL in ERA. He is tied for 
the league lead in complete games (eight), sixth in strikeouts (92) and ninth 
in innings pitched (124 1/3). Opponents are hitting .235 against him. 
</P>
<P>
White leads the majors in triples (nine), is third in the league in steals (25) 
and has 31 extra-base hits. 
</P>
<P>
White, whose batting average has fallen 27 points in the last two weeks, said 
he was "a little shocked" when he came to Anaheim Stadium and was told by a 
reporter that he had made the team. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been struggling the last couple of weeks," White said, "and I thought I'd 
blown my chances. I was surprised, but I'm honored. Maybe this will loosen me 
up a little. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought Brian (Downing) would be picked and I thought Blyleven would make 
it. There are so many players out there, it's tough to say whether I deserve it 
or not. But I was chosen and I'm going. I'm looking forward to three days of 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
Finley, who had been fielding questions about his All-Star chances for three 
weeks, said the selection was "a load off my mind." 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, I'm just glad it's over," Finley said. "I've known about the 
possibility for a while but I've been trying not to think about it. I just 
tried to take it one game at a time, got a little luck here and there, and 
ended up 10-6." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Finley has been the Angels' most dominating pitcher. With added poise 
and a new forkball, Finley has come a long way from last season, when he was 
9-15. 
</P>
<P>
"The new pitch has changed me," Finley said, "but getting off on a roll and 
having the confidence has something to do with it, too." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Manager Doug Rader said he was happy for the two players who made the 
team but felt badly for "others who were as deserving." 
</P>
<P>
Only Blyleven admitted he was disappointed, though. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I had a chance," Blyleven said. "It would have been an honor and 
special because it's at home, but I didn't make it. So . . . I won't even watch 
it then. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody want to buy some All-Star tickets?"

A TOP DESIGNER SUMS UP THE L.A. LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ISAAC MIZRAHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just two years ago, Isaac Mizrahi won a place as a bright new light in American 
fashion. Admirers are charmed by his sense of style that is part clean cut, 
part come hither and always laced with his own smart sense of humor. Among his 
eclectic inspirations he includes Hollywood glamour queens and California 
nature girls. They also supply the essential elements of what he calls the L.A. 
look. Mizrahi will present his fall collection at Saks, Beverly Hills, on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 I like to think glamour was invented in Hollywood. And I don't agree with 
people who equate looking glamorous with looking middle-aged. There have always 
been glamorous women who were quite young. Clara Bow was only 22 when she 
appeared in "It," the movie that made her a screen idol. And Madonna, who is to 
me the essence of glamour now, is just 30 years old. I find that all glamorous 
women have at least one thing in common: They don't try to be glamorous. Or at 
least, they don't appear to try. 
</P>
<P>
Lately I've been fascinated to learn that it was studio executives in the 
'20s-'40s who actually created the image of the glamorous Hollywood woman. 
Scott Berg writes about it in his new book, "Goldwyn: A Biography." He 
describes how the image was painstakingly built. To me, the modern equivalent 
is the art director who builds images of elegant, contemporary women for the 
covers of fashion magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Now, of course, there aren't any board meetings to decide which shade of blond 
an actress' eyebrows ought to be dyed. Part of me longs for those days, and 
those kinds of studio executives who took charge of educating the public about 
elegance. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't come naturally to most people. Yet I can revel in the new breed of 
movie stars, whose appeal is based on their individuality, for better or worse. 
They make their own decisions about style -- sometimes brilliantly. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is the home of Hollywood, a lot of people think Los Angeles is a 
glamour factory and little else. But they're missing an aspect to the city that 
I particularly like. It's a healthy, natural place where life is lived outdoors 
in the sun. At least, it seems that way to most New Yorkers, who are locked up 
in high-rise office buildings and subway cars so much of the time. 
</P>
<P>
The California weather is so close to perfect that I sometimes imagine people 
living here don't really need clothes at all. That would be a fashion 
designer's dream, because it would leave people free to buy what they really 
like, based on what appeals to their senses. 
</P>
<P>
From what I've noticed in my four or five visits, something of that free spirit 
actually does exist here. I see a lot of very creative dressing in California. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of it works, of course. I have seen that stereotyped Los Angeles look 
-- the bleached-blond shag haircut worn with the extravagantly beaded, 
far-too-tight-fitting evening dress. And I've seen the overly tanned complexion 
that looks like leather. I'm sure the women who dress that way think they look 
attractive. But if they asked me, I'd tell them they don't. 
</P>
<P>
The California image I admire starts with a perfect body -- and there seem to 
be a lot of them here. I suppose it's because so many people spend so much of 
their time exercising and eating properly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Air of Confidence 
</P>
<P>
It gives them an air of confidence. As if, at any moment, they could strip away 
all the layers of superfluous glitz, the makeup, the restricting undergarments, 
the shoulder pads, and live happily ever after without any of it. 
</P>
<P>
When I design a collection, I have that type of woman in mind: The one who 
wears little if anything underneath her clothes and who wouldn't wear shoes at 
all if she could get away with it. 
</P>
<P>
That freedom-loving attitude inspired a recent evening dress of mine. I made it 
of porous silk crepe, a very luxurious fabric. But I shaped it into the 
simplest, long cardigan sweater. And I sent it down the runway on a barefoot 
model. 
</P>
<P>
All of my evening clothes are meant to be that effortless, because I like to 
see a woman who is going out for the night look as if she just stepped out of 
her boudoir. Many of my designs are actually inspired by lingerie. I realize it 
takes a certain confidence to wear your lingerie out to dinner. But I see an 
awful lot of that type of dressing in California, especially on the streets and 
in the nightclubs. Madonna's always wearing her underwear as outerwear. 
</P>
<P>
When I think about it, my kind of evening clothes have always had a home in Los 
Angeles. So much of night life here is planned around people's fabulous houses. 
They entertain within those private confines, where they are free to express 
their personal style. 
</P>
<P>
I see glamour, and I see effortless dressing here. But there is one other thing 
about the Los Angeles look that I find attractive. It is the way some women 
draw from the cultural heritage of the city and blend native fashion elements 
with the new. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, what made a woman chic was her ability to mix fashion elements 
from many sources. I am delighted to see a blend of modern clothing with 
ancient Mexican or American Indian classics. 
</P>
<P>
I think of Millicent Rogers in Taos, N.M., the late art patron who collected 
Navajo silver jewelry and wore it with her big, white shirts and long, sweeping 
skirts. 
</P>
<P>
And I think of my Los Angeles friend, Lisa Eisner, who works for Vogue 
magazine. Her dress style is inspired by the great women of Santa Fe and 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa is currently passing through an extreme Frida Kahlo period. Kahlo was a 
Mexican painter with the most incredible style. 
</P>
<P>
In her honor, Lisa wears jeans, a white shirt, braided hair and mountains of 
Navajo jewelry. With the most elegant evening dress she will mix an authentic 
Mexican jacket cut like a bolero and richly embroidered with silk floss. 
</P>
<P>
Her look draws directly from the cultural roots of Southern California. I'd 
like to see more women integrate the local heritage into their personal style. 
</P>
<P>
I find that juxtaposing genuine, historical elements in an unexpected way is 
far more interesting than anything prepackaged. I feel that way about fashion 
and about other aspects of style. There is nothing less appetizing than a 
stuffy meal pre-planned by some pretentious chef in some trendy restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The common denominator in all of modern style is this: It must represent 
individuality.

CHECK IT OUT, DUDES: SURFER, 26, CASHES IN ON A COMPUTER WAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PRESTON LERNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Up and down the beaches of Southern California, thousands of teen-agers stare 
past the rolling waves and fantasize about life after graduation -- escaping 
from high school without getting stuck in the 9-to-5 grind, making big bucks 
without holding down a real job . . . in short, growing older without growing 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Dream on, you say? Well, check out this dude named Jeff Maier, Irvine's 
original surf-rat-slash-computer-phenom who invented the surfin' answer to the 
mechanical bull of "Urban Cowboy." The interactive video game features a real 
live 6-foot-long surfboard. By the end of this year, with sales of his Urban 
Surfin' simulators poised to begin booming on four continents, he expects to 
earn seven figures and change. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I could live on a million a year," 26-year-old Maier says. 
</P>
<P>
The fun-loving kid, whose top priorities are still sun, surf and girls, 
certainly has a knack for computer programming and self-promotion. He ditched 
college for a computer trade school after a class in electronics convinced him 
programming was a more lucrative way to go. He quickly landed a prestigious job 
at Rockwell International writing esoteric software for the NAVSTAR satellite. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone I worked with had a doctorate," he says. "I was only, like, 22 -- the 
youngest by about 10 years. It was very intense." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Found New Profession 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of his two-year stint at Rockwell, Maier bought a Commodore 64 and 
taught himself to write video games. In 1984, he began knocking out two games a 
week at $500 a pop, for a "schlock" home computer game outfit. Then he was 
snatched by Coleco to write their Cabbage Patch Kids video games. He had found 
a new profession. 
</P>
<P>
"Writing a video game isn't work. It's fun," he says. "You see a ball bouncing 
across the screen and if it doesn't work, you look until you find the problem. 
It's like solving a puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
Applying his computer skills to surfing was a natural for the kid who used to 
hitch to the beach before sunrise to surf all day. His joy-stick home video 
game debuted in 1985 and sold 2,000 copies. Buoyed by the success, he built an 
arcade version and put it in Kahuna, a San Diego surfer bar. 
</P>
<P>
"It was taking in just tons of quarters," he says. "In fact, I was thinking of 
retiring and just riding my bike along the boardwalk picking up my sacks of 
quarters." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bigger Than a Joy Stick 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he had, like, a stroke of genius: He replaced the joy stick with a 
surfboard. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was that players would actually stand on the board, and whatever moves 
they made would control the computer-generated surfer on the video monitor. 
Talk about interactive video: Accomplished surfers could ride the tube, cut the 
lip and perform 360s to dominate the digitized waves. Novices, on the other 
hand, would indulge in some hard-core face-plants. 
</P>
<P>
The machine, assembled on his living room table, was unveiled in 1987 at the 
Red Onion in Huntington Beach. It was an immediate rage. Not only with surfers. 
As one surfing magazine snipped, "Most (patrons) look as though their greatest 
affair with water is in the shower." 
</P>
<P>
Maier was besieged with prospective customers, but, since he could only build 
two machines a week, max, he decided to offer his creation to a major video 
game manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consultant Took a Chance 
</P>
<P>
The company turned him down, but the consultant it hired to evaluate the game 
-- Paul Scribner -- decided to take a personal gamble on the simulator, 
convinced that the novelty appeal might make the machine a winner on the 
nightclub circuit. Scribner bought rights to the simulator from Maier and 
formed a company -- Scribner Enterprises of Santa Ana -- to manufacture and 
market it. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 units have been sold since production began a few months ago, and 
Scribner says he expects to sell 1,000 by the end of the year and twice as many 
during the next 12 months -- chicken feed by industry standards, true, but 
nothing to sneeze at when you consider the deluxe models retail for $2,795. 
</P>
<P>
"If we sell 2,000 units," Scribner says, "I'll be a happy camper." Not so 
farfetched now that they've lined up national sponsorship from Miller Lite, 
Ocean Pacific and Panama Jack. 
</P>
<P>
Maier trots around the globe promoting Urban Surfin', welcoming every 
opportunity to give hands-on lessons. Judging from how much he relishes these 
gigs, in fact, it sometimes seems as if he invented the simulator to give him 
an excuse to play party animal in nightclubs all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
But despite his wild-and-crazy persona, Maier says he avoids drugs, rarely 
drinks more than a couple of beers and favors a diet heavy on veggies. He gets 
his biggest kick out of putting the finishing touches on a killer game 
simulating the sport of snowboarding -- something like surfing on ski slopes. 
</P>
<P>
Maier doesn't care what the future holds so long as it involves "surfing, 
skiing and making a lot of money." He smiles ingenuously and adds, "I don't 
have to call in sick to anybody."

ADVANTAGE, THE AMERICAN WAY;

<P>
AFTER FLEEING APARTHEID, AUTHOR MARK MATHABANE HAS HIS OWN SPECIAL SPIN ON U.S. 
RACE RELATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ITABARI NJERI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At times he seems a combination of Martin Luther King Jr., whom he paraphrases 
often, and Gandhi, whose countenance he resembles, as he speaks in soft, 
earnest tones while sporting little, round spectacles like the ones the Mahatma 
wore. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Mathabane, one muses, is a man in the process of self-creation. 
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old author of "Kaffir Boy in America" (Charles Scribner's Sons), 
the recently published sequel to his best-selling autobiography, "Kaffir Boy" 
-- his story of the horrors of growing up black under South African apartheid 
-- is explaining why he is not as angry as he says many African Americans would 
like him to be. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knows Anger's Consequences 
</P>
<P>
"Given my experiences with apartheid" (the white minority government's policy 
of racial separation in South Africa), Mathabane finds it difficult to carry 
the burden of so much hostility around with him daily, he says. "I know the 
consequences of that much anger." It is self-defeating. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the most important lesson my mother taught me. I had to transcend the 
hatred and anger, despite the pain -- and that's likely a daily battle because 
of the racist incidents I will encounter. But if I did not succumb to those 
negative emotions, I had a better chance of preserving my humanity." 
</P>
<P>
Sweat streaks Mathabane's smooth face as he reaches for a cup of orange juice. 
He's sitting in the hot sun at the Tennis Place in Los Angeles after lobbing a 
few balls over the net for a photograph. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tennis Helped Him Flee 
</P>
<P>
Tennis is what allowed Mathabane to flee the circumscribed life ordained for 
him by whites in South Africa. Wimbledon tennis champion Stan Smith met the 
teen-age Mathabane while in South Africa. Smith saw the accomplished but 
largely self-taught player at a tournament and arranged a tennis scholarship 
for him at tiny Limestone College in Gaffney, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
When Mathabane, who was more interested in grades than athletics (and never had 
the talent to play world-class tennis anyway, he writes) lost his scholarship, 
Smith continued to pay for his college education. 
</P>
<P>
Smith and other whites have been very important to Mathabane's success in 
America; though, after 10 years here, the author and lecturer says he is fully 
aware of the racism that exists here. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever bitterness he held toward whites because of the brutality he suffered 
at their hands in South Africa had to be weighed against the "important 
friendships I have formed with white people. I have accepted them for what the 
content of their characters revealed." 
</P>
<P>
Black Americans he has met while attending schools in the United States, and 
those he has encountered while promoting the new book, often have difficulty 
accepting this view, he says. 
</P>
<P>
But "I know the danger of lumping all whites in the same foul band as the 
racists and consigning them to perdition simply because of collective guilt. I 
know the danger of doing that because the corollary . . . is this: What do you 
do with those black people who inflict so much pain on their own people?" 
</P>
<P>
Mathabane is leaning forward, his voice growing softer as his emotions 
intensify. 
</P>
<P>
"In South Africa, we had the (black) police and the heads of the homelands," 
areas to which the white government has forcibly relocated blacks, "who were 
just as corrupt and brutal as the whites." 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, "we have (black) drug dealers feeding poison to young 
minds. So, do you say, because of my blackness I am in solidarity with those 
people?" Unfortunately, he continues, "there are some who do, as is shown by 
the startling example of a drug kingpin in D.C., who was arrested. When he 
appeared in court, there was this vocal congregation of blacks there in support 
of him, because the police who made the arrest were white. That is dangerous. 
The reality is that there are good black people and bad black people, just as 
there are good white people and bad. If we are ever to have the moral 
consistency, which is the strongest weapon of our cause, we ought to have the 
courage and willingness to be able to transcend judgment of people based on 
their skin color." 
</P>
<P>
When Mathabane speaks his voice is mellifluous, caressing and musical like so 
many black South African accents. But each word is issued with the precision of 
a needle entering a vein. So impressive is his manner of speech that one might 
forget that his comments -- like his new book -- cover previously explored 
social terrain, albeit it with uncommon poetic vigor and through the eyes of a 
South African immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, while at Quincy College in Illinois -- it was his third school in one 
year, at each of the others he'd been viewed as a loner by blacks and whites, 
or too uppity, or too studious -- he discovered black literature. Richard 
Wright's searing autobiography, "Black Boy," was the first. This classic, a 
depiction of Wright's youth in the South, mirrored Mathabane's harrowing 
childhood under apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, he went back to the school library and asked for more books by 
black authors. The Franciscan priest who was the head librarian "guided me to 
the treasure. 
</P>
<P>
"I checked out Richard Wright's 'Native Son,' Eldridge Cleaver's 'Soul on Ice,' 
W.E.B. Du Bois's 'Souls of Black Folks,' 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X,' 
Franz Fanon's 'The Wretched of the Earth,' Claude Brown's 'Manchild in the 
Promised Land,' James Baldwin's 'The Fire Next Time' and 'Notes of a Native 
Son,' Maya Angelou's 'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,' James Weldon Johnson's 
'The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man,' and the autobiography and incendiary 
speeches of Frederick Douglass." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Consumed Western Classics 
</P>
<P>
These men and women, Mathabane continues in his book, "had written about what I 
felt and thought, what I had been through as a black man, what I desired, what 
I dreamed about. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The idealistic author is clearly the repository of much intelligence, having 
consumed the classics of Western literature and devoured the revolutionary 
documents of the United States -- he traveled on the long, often bewildering 
flight from South Africa to America with dog-eared copies of the Constitution, 
the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence. 
</P>
<P>
When he arrived, he was to learn that the America he had read about, heard 
about on Voice of America broadcasts, seen on the cover of black magazines, was 
grossly different from the reality. He saw subtle, socially sanctioned -- if 
not legal -- apartheid in the United States. He saw black ghettoes in America 
as squalid and filled with the panoply of pathologies bred of oppression -- 
alcoholism, domestic abuse, gangs -- that existed in his black township of 
Alexandra where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
But he writes that in America, through education, he found "a second chance in 
life -- a life I have dedicated to the struggle for justice." 
</P>
<P>
Even when his intelligence is the echo of what others have already felt, 
thought and dreamed, it does not negate whatever truth may exist there. And one 
hears, as Mathabane speaks so carefully -- always seeming to weigh perception 
against reality, fury against logic -- an intellect constantly refining itself; 
a man tuning himself into a more astute receptor and generator of ideas. 
</P>
<P>
On the difference between a black living in the American North and South, 
Mathabane says: "In the North, the tendency was to pretend that 'We like you" 
and then you turn around and you have this dagger going into your back. In the 
South, you knew where you stood. If somebody didn't like you, they would tell 
you to your face." 
</P>
<P>
But, Mathabane adds, "in the South I have found more genuine progress than all 
the liberal sentiments that I had heard in New York." 
</P>
<P>
New York is one of the most "polarized cities in America. It is a two-tier 
society with a vengeance and the people at the bottom of the totem pole are 
black. You have your so-called liberals saying, 'Oh, don't worry. These things 
will be taken care of.' But they perpetuate something that is just as deadly, 
this attitude that black people are incapable of defining their agenda . . . of 
pushing it as effectively as any other group." Rather, "they say 'Tell us what 
is the problem and we'll do it for you.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lives With Family 
</P>
<P>
Mathabane now lives in Kernersville, N.C. -- between Winston-Salem and 
Greensboro -- with his wife, Gail, a white American writer he met while at 
Columbia University, their daughter, Bianca, and several of his siblings who 
were brought to America by Oprah Winfrey. 
</P>
<P>
In the South, Mathabane found "black communities that were some of the most 
powerful and successful I'd seen anywhere. And there was not this destructive 
anger. These people were content and proud and knew what it is that they were 
fighting against." 
</P>
<P>
The successful Southern black communities Mathabane saw underscore the 
importance of identity and self-perception to black progress in America, he 
believes. African Americans must think beyond their numerical status in 
America, which makes them a minority, he says. They must see themselves as part 
of the larger black world -- which includes Africa and the Caribbean -- but 
most importantly as part of the "human" family, he asserts. 
</P>
<P>
"We do ourselves a disservice by making it seem that our whole identity is 
predicated upon race. As a black from Africa, as part of the majority, my 
identity and pride were never that much in question -- even under apartheid." 
</P>
<P>
Though immigrants by their nature -- driven, tenacious, bold -- are more 
motivated than others, Mathabane believes that coming from a majority culture, 
having a strong sense of identity and family values, accounts for the success 
of so many West Indian and African blacks in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing," he says, "what happens when you finally free your mind of those 
mental shackles. When you realize that the most important thing I have to fight 
as a black person in an oppressive, racist society is what I think about 
myself. It is so easy to fall into the state of saying, 'I am a victim.' It is 
formidable, but (African Americans) have to succeed in America despite racism. 
You have to, this is your fate. This is your lot. You belong here." 
</P>
<P>
If Mathabane sounds like a soapbox orator, it's because he believes words are 
weapons. And he laments, in person and in print, that he may have come to the 
United States a generation too late. 
</P>
<P>
"The progressive movement in America has lost its soul," he writes. He longs 
for the '60s when "courage and idealism" fueled "the civil rights movement, the 
Great Society and the New Frontier." A time when "whites and blacks . . . stood 
side by side." 
</P>
<P>
He abhors the "rabid" conservatism of the Ronald Reagan years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Ronald Reagan has achieved a true revolution. He has turned blacks 
into these creatures called buppies (black upwardly mobile professionals)," 
bemoans Mathabane. These black counterparts to yuppies, he says, make the 
"egregious mistake of forgetting that many of them came from a ghetto and that 
they are needed in that ghetto, as examples, much more than anything." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, "they arrange themselves in these enclaves and imbibe all the goals of 
materialistic happiness, forgetting one of the important things about blacks is 
their spirit of community. They forget that it does not take much to touch the 
life of a boy or girl in a positive manner." 
</P>
<P>
Mathabane, true to his beliefs, works with young people through his local 
library, explaining to them the importance of education and how it transformed 
his life. The first part of that life will be put on film by Winfrey, whose 
production company, Harpo Productions, purchased the movie rights to "Kaffir 
Boy." 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1986, when Mathabane appeared on Winfrey's program, the talk show host 
and philanthropist flew his grandmother, mother, three sisters and brother to 
Chicago for the show. His mother saw America and told her son: "Child this is 
Canaan. This is the land of milk and honey." 
</P>
<P>
His family had lived in a place where there was one facecloth among them, where 
police regularly raided homes, forcing family members to stand naked before the 
dawn. Once here, they gave Mathabane a litany of why they loved America, he 
recounts in his book: 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't required to carry passes." 
</P>
<P>
"We can go anywhere we want." 
</P>
<P>
"We can ride in the same buses and use the same toilet as anyone." 
</P>
<P>
"In America all people are equal." 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of his book, Mathabane writes: "I knew that there was more to 
America than what my family saw, heard, or was exposed to, but I did not want 
to lessen their sense of joy and liberation. After all, their visit to America 
was only supposed to last a month. If they had to go back to South Africa, I 
wanted them to know that somewhere they could breathe free. . . ."

2 BIG EIGHT ACCOUNTING FIRMS TO MERGE; 2 OTHERS MAY JOIN FORCES SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two of the nation's largest accounting firms announced Thursday that they have 
agreed in principle to combine operations, and two even bigger concerns began 
formal merger talks. 
</P>
<P>
If both deals succeed, the so-called Big Eight accounting firms would shrink to 
five multibillion-dollar giants in an effort to serve better their growing 
multinational clients in today's global economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure is for bigness as marketplaces internationalize," said Robert 
Crane, editor of Accounting Today. "The big, big companies are looking for 
their accounting firms to serve them on a worldwide basis." 
</P>
<P>
Agreeing to merge were New York-based Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells and Touche 
Ross &amp; Co. If partners of the two firms approve the merger, the new entity 
will be known as Deloitte &amp; Touche, with 1989 revenue exceeding $4 billion 
and more than 65,000 employees worldwide, the companies said in a joint 
statement. In terms of 1988 revenue, Deloitte &amp; Touche would rank fourth in 
the United States and fourth worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an even bigger combination is afoot as the nation's No. 1 firm, 
Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., and Price Waterhouse &amp; Co. announced formal 
merger negotiations. Combined, they would create a global powerhouse with $5 
billion in revenue. That would be nearly $1 billion larger than its closest 
rival, Ernst &amp; Young, the result of the recently announced merger of two 
other Big Eight firms, Ernst &amp; Whinney and Arthur Young. 
</P>
<P>
Ernst &amp; Young is expected to begin operations Oct. 1, pending approval by 
overseas partners. However, the Arthur Andersen-Price Waterhouse negotiations 
may well prove thorny, said Crane of Accounting Today. "They are taking only 
the first step in an unlikely trip," he said. "The philosophies and cultures of 
these companies are in direct contradiction, and they will have a whale of a 
tough time finding common ground." 
</P>
<P>
According to the Deloitte and Touche announcement, J. Michael Cook, currently 
chief executive of Deloitte Haskins, would become chairman and head of U.S. 
operations. Edward A. Kangas, Touche's chief executive, would become chief 
executive of the international organization and managing partner of the 
domestic firm. 
</P>
<P>
In stressing global markets, Cook noted that "The continuing growth of the 
Pacific Rim . . . requires a strong service capability in key Asian markets." 
The international unit of the merged entity includes Tohmatsu Awoki &amp; 
Sanwa, a leading Japanese audit firm and longtime member of Touche Ross 
International. 
</P>
<P>
The firms Cook and Kangas now head are the smallest of the so-called Big Eight 
but have grown rapidly. Between 1985 and 1988, their revenue increased 88%, 
according to Bowman's Accounting Report, an Atlanta-based publication. Growth 
last year averaged 26%, compared to 22% for their bigger brethren. 
</P>
<P>
Neither firms would comment on whether any jobs would be lost in the merger, 
but some industry observers said support staff would likely be trimmed. But 
industry publisher Arthur Bowman predicted "some fallout at the partner level," 
explaining: "You don't need two partners in charge of the same little area." 
</P>
<P>
Meeting the complexities of companies dealing in markets around the world 
underlies much of the merger mania among the giants of accounting and 
consulting since the joining two years ago of Klynvel Main Goerdeler with Peat 
Marwick International, now KMG Peat Marwick, second in U.S. revenue and the 
world leader with $3.9 billion in 1988 revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Global developments were among the reasons cited on Thursday, too, by the heads 
of Arthur Andersen and Price Waterhouse in announcing their merger negotiations 
and pledging themselves to confidentiality for the next 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
"These developments," the companies said, "are creating a demand for increased 
worldwide professional and financial resources with which to serve clients' 
needs." 
</P>
<P>
With six accounting firms possibly pairing off this year, only Coopers &amp; 
Lybrand -- something of an industry loner -- would sit out the current merger 
activity among the Big Eight. The phrase refers to the eight worldwide firms 
that provide accounting, auditing, tax and consulting services to about 75% of 
all public companies in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"This group will merge themselves down to five or four players," said James 
Emerson, publisher of The Big Eight, a monthly magazine based in Bellevue, 
Wash. "The second tier (of smaller firms) will probably start merging, too, but 
for the moment they get something of a breather." 
</P>
<P>
The most likely merger in that second tier, Emerson said, appear to be Spicer 
Oppenheim in New York, with about $344 million in revenue, and Pannell Kerr 
Forster in Houston, with $317 million in 1988 revenue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FROM THE BIG EIGHT TO THE BIG FIVE 
</P>
<P>
The three pending or proposed mergers in the accounting industry would compress 
the list of firms known as the Big Eight.

Ranking is based on the firms' fiscal 1988 revenue from U.S. operations, as 
compiled by Bowman's Accounting Report of Atlanta. The list assumes completion 
of the merger announced in May of Ernst &amp; Whinney with Arthur Young &amp; 
Co., formerly third and sixth, respectively. On Thursday, Deloitte Haskins 
&amp; Sells and Touche Ross announced an agreement in principle to merge. 
Separately, Arthur Andersen and Price Waterhouse disclosed that they have begun 
formal merger talks.

1986 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 14: Stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky agrees to pay $100 million to settle 
charges of trading on insider information. He also agrees to cooperate with 
investigators and to plead guilty to a single, unspecified criminal charge. 
</P>
<P>
1987 
</P>
<P>
March 19: Boyd L. Jefferies, founder of the Los Angeles securities firm 
Jefferies &amp; Co., agrees to plead guilty to two criminal charges involving 
securities law violations, including one deal involving Boesky. He is not 
accused of insider trading. Jefferies, who was implicated by Boesky, resigns as 
chairman of Jefferies &amp; Co. and agrees to stay out of the securities 
business for at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 18: Boesky is sentenced to a three-year prison term but not fined. 
</P>
<P>
July 6: Using information supplied by Jefferies, a federal grand jury in 
Manhattan indicts GAF Corp., company Vice Chairman James Sherwin and two 
subsidiaries on charges that they manipulated the price of Union Carbide stock 
in 1986 after a failed attempt to acquire the company. 
</P>
<P>
1988 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 3: A grand jury indicts Salim B. (Sandy) Lewis, a well-known takeover 
speculator, on charges that he manipulated the stock price of Fireman's Fund 
Corp. in 1986 to help American Express Co. sell part of its Fireman's Fund 
stake for more money. The indictment is based partly on disclosures by Boyd 
Jefferies more than a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Dec. 22: Corporate raider and Singer Co. Chairman Paul A. Bilzerian is indicted 
by a grand jury on 12 felony counts linked to four unsuccessful takeover deals 
in 1985 and 1986. Charges include securities and tax fraud, conspiracy and 
making false disclosure statements. Jefferies supplied some of the material 
used in the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
1989 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 3: Jefferies makes his courtroom debut, testifying that GAF and Sherwin 
asked him to manipulate the price of Union Carbide stock in the fall of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Jan. 10: U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe declares a mistrial in the GAF 
case, ruling that prosecutors withheld, albeit unintentionally, a key document. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 6: Jefferies takes the stand in the GAF retrial, repeating his allegations 
against GAF. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 8: Defense lawyers attack Jefferies' credibility, labeling him a "crook" 
who had done a "dirty deal" with Boesky. 
</P>
<P>
Feb. 27: Jefferies &amp; Co. head trader James Melton contradicts testimony by 
his former boss. Melton said he didn't recall a request by Sherwin to 
manipulate Carbide stock, as Jefferies had testified. 
</P>
<P>
March 22: After 12 days of deliberations, the GAF jury reports that it is 
hopelessly deadlocked and Judge Lowe declares a second mistrial. Jurors later 
say they didn't believe Jefferies' testimony. 
</P>
<P>
May 10: Jefferies testifies that he purchased and held blocks of stock for 
Bilzerian in four companies in 1985 and 1986. A Jefferies &amp; Co. executive 
later corroborates his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
June 9: Bilzerian is convicted. 
</P>
<P>
June 29: Jefferies, his lawyer and government prosecutors meet with U.S. 
District Judge Morris Lasker to discuss his sentencing. Prosecutors praise his 
cooperation and Jefferies' lawyer requests probation and no jail term. Lasker 
indicates that some prison time is likely. 
</P>
<P>
July 6: Jefferies is sentenced to five years probation and fined $250,000 after 
pleading guilty.

GROWTH-STOCK FUNDS PACE QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mutual funds specializing in growth stocks survived a late-June downturn to 
lead a generally strong performance by equity funds in the second quarter of 
1989, but experts cautioned that the market is likely to slow through the rest 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Two funds that target long-term Treasury bonds fared very well as a result of 
declining interest rates, although fixed-income funds continued to lag behind 
equity funds in overall performance. 
</P>
<P>
At the bottom of the pile, meanwhile, languished precious metals and 
international funds, which were hit by a strong dollar. 
</P>
<P>
A quarterly survey by Lipper Analytical Securities Corp., a New York company 
that tracks mutual fund performance, also showed that, despite gains averaging 
6.09%, the equity funds were outperformed by the major stock market indexes. A 
portfolio of the stocks included in the Dow Jones industrial average, with all 
dividends reinvested, would have yielded a gain of 7.61%, while the Standard 
&amp; Poor's 500-stock index, with dividends reinvested, climbed 8.82%. 
</P>
<P>
A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical, said the indexes had been 
"excessively performing" as a result of takeover activity and added that they 
were not burdened with administrative expenses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gold Funds Weak 
</P>
<P>
Lipper noted that the second quarter was very strong across the board, with 
individual fund performances bunched closely together. "If we did nothing the 
rest of the year, we would still come up with an average year," he observed. 
The quarter was "almost on the 'too good' side." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Mansueto, president of Morningstar Inc., a Chicago firm that follows mutual 
funds, was struck by the continued weakness of the international and gold 
funds: "If you have a bent towards including precious metals for diversity 
reasons, now might be the time" to invest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The top-performing funds for the quarter were two Benham funds -- the Target 
2015 and Target 2010 -- that focus on long-term Treasury bills, followed by 
several small growth and capital appreciation funds. William Corneliuson, 
portfolio manager for Strong Discovery, a $28-million fund that ranked fourth 
among all funds with a 19.54% gain for the quarter, said a strong position in 
cellular telephone and environmental service stocks had given the fund a boost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fidelity Magellan a Leader 
</P>
<P>
Rapidly rising values in cellular phone stocks, as well as lower interest 
rates, pushed Utility Funds to the top of the list of industry-specific "sector 
funds," with a gain of 11.25%. Natural resources funds, up 3.31%, were the 
laggards in this category. 
</P>
<P>
Among the nation's largest mutual funds, Fidelity Magellan was the leader, 
followed by Investment Co. of America, according to Mansueto, who added that 
all the large diversified funds had done fairly well.

CARTER HAWLEY JOINS OUTSIDE BUYING FIRM; 
</P>
<P>
BROADWAY'S PARENT TO SHUT DEVELOPMENT OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Carter Hawley Hale Stores, owner of the Broadway, said Thursday that it is 
shutting down its New York product development office and will affiliate with 
Associated Merchandising Corp., a big research and buying organization for 
Dayton Hudson, Bloomingdale's, Harrod's in London and others. 
</P>
<P>
About 25 of the 220 employees of Carter Hawley Hale Market Services will move 
to AMC's offices on Aug. 1 and will work with AMC staff members to develop 
private label products. Carter Hawley Hale already has a large commitment to 
brands made exclusively for its five department store divisions under such 
names as Neil Martin, C. C. Courtenay and Cassis. 
</P>
<P>
The company said most of Market Services' merchandising employees will be 
offered posts at department store divisions, while many of the 105 support 
personnel will lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Carter Hawley Hale, which opened its independent product office with some 
fanfare six years ago, said joining AMC will provide access to AMC's vast store 
of market research and greater buying clout. 
</P>
<P>
Philip M. Hawley, chairman and chief executive of the Los Angeles-based 
company, said that the shift "isn't essentially an economic decision" and that 
"the economics are close to a wash." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$3-Billion Client 
</P>
<P>
Retail sources estimate the cost of running Market Services at $17 million a 
year. Hawley said expenses for the first two years with AMC will probably 
average $13 million to $14 million a year. In addition, Carter Hawley Hale will 
have the costs of closing down the New York office and adding Market Services 
workers to other divisions. 
</P>
<P>
The addition of Carter Hawley Hale is a big boon for AMC, which through a 
worldwide network of 26 offices represents groups of retailers in making 
purchases from U.S. and foreign manufacturers. With Carter Hawley Hale, AMC 
picks up about $3 billion in business. 
</P>
<P>
Despite widespread turmoil and consolidation in retailing, AMC has managed to 
boost its income by attracting mass merchandisers. Federated Department Stores, 
owner of Bloomingdale's, pulled out of AMC's domestic operations and reportedly 
is also considering dropping the organization as its overseas representative. 
</P>
<P>
Hawley disputed the suggestion that Carter Hawley Hale's move to AMC would lead 
to more of the "sameness" syndrome that has permeated retailing in recent 
years. A frequent customer complaint is that department stores carry 
merchandise that is too similar. Although most house brands tend to be 
mainstream in styling, they do at least offer some distinction. 
</P>
<P>
"Our private label strategy remains unchanged," he said, adding that the 
company still plans for private labels to eventually account for 20% of overall 
sales. House brands, which generally sell for less than comparable national 
brands but are more profitable for the retailer, now account for about 17% of 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
Carter Hawley Hale has 35,000 employees and operates 113 department stores 
under the names the Broadway, the Broadway-Southwest, Weinstock's, Emporium 
Capwell and Thalhimers. Thalhimers, Emporium and H. Capwell were among the 
founding members of AMC in 1916.

MAGNATE SUES TINY FIRM OVER USE OF 'TRUMP CARDS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ATLANTA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Real estate magnate Donald J. Trump usually enjoys seeing his name on things, 
but he's fighting a small Georgia company over "Trump Cards," snazzy business 
cards the billionaire says infringe on his name. 
</P>
<P>
Positive Concepts Ltd., the Lithia Springs company that makes the cards, 
contends it got the name from the term used for a suit in a card game that 
ranks above all others. The company's lawyers say the case has escalated into a 
battle over the limits of money and power. 
</P>
<P>
"Donald Trump simply wants to own the word 'trump,' and anybody who wants 
anything to do with it will have to face Donald Trump," said Atlanta attorney 
Kevin L. Ward. "We can't give up a word in the English language just because 
somebody has the power and money to do so." 
</P>
<P>
But Trump's attorneys say their client's name has become so well known that 
consumers are going to be confused into thinking the cards are backed by the 
man. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Trump won a federal court order temporarily barring a company from 
using the name "Trump Shuttle" for a moving and storage subsidiary in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Trump renamed Eastern Airlines' Washington-to-New York-to-Boston air shuttle 
the "Trump Shuttle" after buying it for $365 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys now are compiling depositions for the business card case, which 
ultimately will be considered by the federal Trademark and Patent Board in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Used by Another Firm 
</P>
<P>
At issue is PCL's line of business cards, which feature a photograph of the 
holder. The suburban Atlanta company has been making and distributing the cards 
since 1982, and currently has sales of about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
Company President Edward A. Zito said he adopted the name from a California 
company that also made the cards under the name "Trump Cards." Zito said the 
California company went out of business in 1982 and never obtained a trademark. 
</P>
<P>
Zito said he was unfamiliar with Donald Trump at the time. Zito does not play 
cards, but said he decided to stick with the trump name after looking it up in 
a dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
PCL applied for a trademark registration in 1985, and Trump's attorneys filed a 
notice of opposition after the government published the request in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In a written notice, Trump's attorneys alleged that PCL chose the "Trump Cards" 
name to "benefit . . . from the worldwide fame, distribution and glamour of 
Donald J. Trump and his 'Trump' name."

Merger Activity Drops: Despite several large corporate acquisitions proposed in 
the first half of 1989, merger activity is lagging behind the pace set last 
year, according to a report by Securities Data Co. An analysis by Securities 
Data of deals worth $10 million or more showed that there was $164.9 billion in 
activity in the first half of 1989, representing 695 announced deals, compared 
to $209.5 billion in 784 deals in the comparable period last year. The report 
also showed that only 24 deals worth $1 billion or more were reported in the 
period, compared to 52 a year earlier.

DISNEY BUYOUT OF STEINBERG'S STAKE DEFENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL DELUGACH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walt Disney Co.'s former chief financial officer testified Thursday that raider 
Saul P. Steinberg might have made "at least" a $1.2-billion profit if he had 
taken control of the company at the price he proposed in 1984. The assessment 
was based on management data on the "breakup" value of Disney's assets at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
As a witness in a so-called greenmail trial, retired Disney executive Michael 
Bagnall said he believed Steinberg "was trying to steal the company" when he 
offered $62.50 a share for a 49% stake. Bagnall supported the company's thesis 
that its purchase of Steinberg's 11% interest for $77.50 a share (including 
expenses) was a bargain, even though it was above the market price at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Since June 27, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury has heard testimony in two 
civil suits alleging that Steinberg, Disney and the 11 people who sat on 
Disney's board in June, 1984, and two investment banking firms violated their 
fiduciary duty to Disney shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
One suit is a class action representing persons who sold their Disney stock 
when the market plunged after the Steinberg buyout. Present stockholders 
brought the other suit on the company's behalf. Bagnall was called as a witness 
by plaintiffs, but he made points for defense positions in the case. Unlike two 
other former Disney executives who testified earlier, Bagnall was not a 1984 
director and is not a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
James E. Lyons, an attorney for the Disney directors, asked Bagnall about a 
controversial Disney acquisition, Arvida Corp., at the time Disney was 
defending against Steinberg. Confirming that Arvida brought the company $150 
million in operating profits in its first three years, compared to its 
$200-million cost in Disney stock, Bagnall called it "an outstanding result." 
</P>
<P>
He also testified that a major reason for soaring earnings since 1984 was that 
Disney was "more aggressive in the pricing of the parks." He agreed with 
Steinberg attorney Arthur Liman that this was really "a polite way of saying" 
that it raised the prices at Disneyland and its Florida theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
The witness also agreed that Disney's professional advisers all said the 
Steinberg buyout was "a good deal." Asked if he would rescind the deal today if 
he could, Bagnall said, "Absolutely not."

MANISCHEWITZ ACCEPTS BID BY INVESTOR GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Matzo maker B. Manischewitz Co. said Thursday that it has agreed to a sweetened 
takeover bid by a Beverly Hills investment firm that topped a "best and final" 
offer from a rival kosher products firm. 
</P>
<P>
Manischewitz late Wednesday accepted an offer of $841 a share, or $44.6 
million, by Levine, Tessler, Leichtman &amp; Co. That bid surpassed by $1 a 
share an enhanced offer by National Foods, the distributor of Hebrew National 
products. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, Jersey City, N.J.-based Manischewitz tentatively approved a 
$40.1-million acquisition offer from Levine Tessler. That agreement, however, 
was scuttled by a legal challenge that National Foods mounted to give it more 
time to put together a new deal. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared statement, Manischewitz said the new Levine Tessler bid not only 
was higher than National Foods' revised offer, but also could be completed 
sooner. Manischewitz said the company plans to hold a shareholders meeting July 
14 or soon thereafter to vote on Levine Tessler's offer. 
</P>
<P>
A National Foods investment adviser could not be reached Thursday, and Arthur 
E. Levine, chairman of Levine Tessler, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The higher bid appeared to be a victory for Jeffrey M. Herr, a longtime 
Manischewitz director who had frequently cast the sole dissenting vote in board 
meetings held to consider Levine Tessler's proposed deal. He had contended that 
the offer was too low and was unfair to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Manischewitz, founded 101 years ago by a rabbi in Cincinnati, makes a full line 
of kosher foods for Passover and daily use. In addition to matzo, the products 
include gefilte fish, borscht and chicken and vegetable soups. Since 1933, the 
Manischewitz name has also been licensed for use on wine. 
</P>
<P>
For the year ended July 31, 1988, Manischewitz reported net income of $2.9 
million on sales of $30.1 million.

ST. LAURENT STOCK OFFERING HALTED; IT'S TOO FASHIONABLE

The flotation of shares in French fashion legend Yves Saint Laurent was 
postponed Thursday after so many would-be investors rushed to buy a stake that 
the offering was oversubscribed. 
</P>
<P>
The shares offered in Groupe Yves Saint Laurent, the first French fashion house 
to seek a stock exchange listing, were more than 250 times oversubscribed, 
broker Francois Dufour-Kervern said. 
</P>
<P>
The issue, representing slightly more than 10% of YSL's share capital, was 
rescheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The offer price of $133 would remain, but investors would be required to place 
deposits equal to the number of shares requested to prevent speculative bids, 
Dufour-Kervern said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have put in for 100 times what they wanted, and there will be 
a lot of withdrawals next week," one British analyst predicted. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday's enthusiastic reception was a good start for company Chairman 
Pierre Berge's decidedly cautious venture on the Bourse, carefully publicized 
beforehand with full page advertisements in French and international 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Berge hopes to protect the company from takeover bids and avoid the kind of 
bitter power battle seen at luxury group LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton. 
</P>
<P>
"I was directly inspired by what had happened at LVMH," Berge said in a recent 
interview. "LVMH for me was an example of how not to do things, and I studied 
what had happened there in order to do exactly the opposite." 
</P>
<P>
LVMH's ambitious new chairman, Bernard Arnault, is admired as a brilliant 
financier, but some doubt his ability to safeguard the group's reputation for 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Industry Changing 
</P>
<P>
"In general, raiders are financiers who don't know anything about our 
profession and don't understand the culture of the luxury products profession," 
Berge said. 
</P>
<P>
The YSL flotation is regarded as a sign of things to come in the increasingly 
competitive French fashion world. Family-run fashion houses are being rapidly 
bought out by entrepreneurs with their eyes on exploiting their reputations 
more profitably. 
</P>
<P>
The special structure adopted allows Berge to choose a successor to himself and 
to Yves Saint Laurent, whose creative work is the inspiration behind the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Berge and Saint Laurent have worked together since 1961, when the young 
designer emerged from under the mantle of his mentor, the late Christian Dior. 
</P>
<P>
The 52-year-old Saint Laurent, who has reportedly been quite ill lately, is 
still the undisputed king of French fashion, although 85% of the $406-million 
sales last year were in perfumes. 
</P>
<P>
The YSL group, which had a 1988 net profit of $9 million, has been undergoing 
reorganization since buying back most of its perfumes business from U.S.-based 
Charles of the Ritz in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
But it needs the cash from the flotation and from a recent $187-million capital 
increase to cover debts incurred by buying out most of the YSL stake held by 
Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti. 
</P>
<P>
Benedetti's holding company Cerus cut its 49.9% stake in YSL to 15% in June. 
</P>
<P>
YSL aims to use the new injection of cash to strengthen its international 
presence, particularly in North America and Southeast Asia. Accessories are 
another priority, with a range of new boutiques planned in Paris, New York and 
other capitals.

DOW RISES 5.88 IN MARKET'S 3RD STRAIGHT GAIN

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market eked out its third straight gain in another quiet session 
Thursday as traders awaited the latest monthly report on employment. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 5.88 to 2,462.44, bringing its gain 
since the start of the week to 22.38 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 140.45 million shares, against 
127.70 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department is due to issue statistics today on the employment 
situation for June. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect the figures to show growth at the rate of as much as 250,000 in 
non-farm payroll employment, more than double the 101,000 preliminary increase 
reported for May. 
</P>
<P>
But they also maintain that the June figure will be inflated by a quirk in the 
timing of surveys on which the data is based. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, some argue, the latest evidence may not deter the Federal Reserve from 
relaxing its credit policy to cushion the impact of a slowdown in business 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
Brokers added that a pickup in employment might be warmly received anyway in 
the financial world right now, by serving to calm the recession worries that 
began to flare up late last month. 
</P>
<P>
Armstrong World Industries rose 1 3/8 to 49 1/4 in active trading on top of a 4 
3/8-point jump Wednesday, when the company said the Belzberg family of 
Vancouver, Canada, had acquired 9.85% of its stock and was considering a 
possible bid for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
Takeover rumors and speculation lifted several other issues, among them Syntex, 
up 3/4 at 50; UAL, up 5 1/2 at 152 1/2, and Whitman, up 1 at 34 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
General Public Utilities rose 5/8 to 40 7/8, surpassing highs dating back to 
the 1960s. The company, whose stock traded as low as 3 3/8 in the aftermath of 
the accident at its Three Mile Island nuclear power plant 10 years ago, raised 
its quarterly dividend from 45 cents to 55 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
In over-the-counter trading, Apple Computer climbed 3/4 to 41 1/4 and Adobe 
Systems dropped 2 3/8 to 24 1/2. Apple said it planned to sell its 16.4% stake 
in Adobe and was developing products to compete with some Adobe technologies. 
</P>
<P>
As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000 actively traded 
stocks, the market increased $10.80 billion, or 0.34%, in value. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained 0.57 to 
178.92. 
</P>
<P>
Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.02 to 367.19, and S&amp;P's 
500-stock composite index was up 0.91 at 321.55. 
</P>
<P>
The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added 2.63 to 
439.57. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index closed at 
361.11, up 1.99. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stocks closed higher in light trading, helped by a sharp rise in the 
Japanese yen in overseas markets and a drop in short-term domestic interest 
rates. The Nikkei 225-share index gained 113.77 points to close at 33,423.48. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stock prices sagged slightly, pulled down by the negative influence 
of Wall Street in a thinly traded market. The Financial Times 100-share index 
ended the day at 2,161.2, down 1.7 points. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices rebounded amid further signs that the Federal Reserve might be 
easing monetary policy and pushing interest rates lower. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose about 7/16 point, or more than 
$4.30 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to price, fell 
to 8.09% from 8.12% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said indications that the Federal Reserve might have eased credit 
helped drive bond prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
"The banking system has a large system of reserves," said economist Ward 
McCarthy of Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates Inc. "The Fed was expected 
to drain some of those reserves and they didn't." 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9.313%, down from 9.375% late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed narrowly higher against all key currencies in thin, 
uneventful trading after a mixed performance overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said the dollar started out higher as traders looked for 
bargains following Wednesday's selloff, which stemmed from continued fears that 
interest rates will fall because the U.S. economy is slowing. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Lutnick, a trader in the New York office of Banco di Sicilia, said the 
currency traded in a fairly narrow range throughout the session in anticipation 
of today's unemployment data for June, an important indicator of the state of 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"People were trying to limit their exposure due to the unemployment numbers," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some dealers said they expected the employment figures to show growth at the 
rate of about 200,000 in non-farm payroll employment, about double the 101,000 
preliminary increase reported for May. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar 
fell to 138.80 Japanese yen from 140.20 yen Wednesday. It traded higher in 
London at 139.10 yen, and in New York at 138.88 yen, up from 138.40 yen late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was mixed against the British pound. One pound cost $1.6230 in 
London, more expensive than Wednesday's $1.6155. Sterling bought $1.6265 in New 
York, down from $1.6285. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices were mostly higher. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold 
bullion for current delivery rose 40 cents to $386.40 an ounce. Republic 
National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at $384.25, down 35 cents 
from late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Raw coffee futures prices slid to new 8-year lows on New York's Coffee, Sugar 
&amp; Cocoa Exchange as the battered market reacted to news that an expected 
freeze in the Brazilian coffee fields had not materialized. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, sugar futures fell sharply for the second straight day; 
energy futures fell; pork futures continued to retreat; grains and soybeans 
were mixed, and precious metals were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee settled 1.49 cents to 6.62 cents lower, with the contract for delivery 
in July at 93.38 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
The selloff erased all of Wednesday's gains and deepened the market's anxiety 
stemming from the suspension of coffee export quotas Monday by the 
International Coffee Organization. 
</P>
<P>
Sugar futures lengthened their steep slide on the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa 
Exchange. Analysts said the market was correcting from an overbought condition 
after making strong gains in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
Sugar settled 0.18 cent to the permitted limit of 0.50 cent lower, with October 
at 13.12 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
Energy futures sagged on the New York Mercantile Exchange on reports that 
striking maintenance and construction workers planned to return to work today 
on North Sea oil production platforms. 
</P>
<P>
West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 26 cents to 54 cents lower, with August 
at $20.30 a barrel.

DEAL SET FOR PASADENA CABLE FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From United Press International 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Choice Cable, a Southern California cable television system with 135,000 
customers, has agreed to be acquired by Cencom Cable of St. Louis, one of 
Choice's owners said. Terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Nathanson, who owns 20% of Choice, said the deal would take several months 
to close because of the transfer of Choice's 19 franchises. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not anticipating any problems with the approvals," Nathanson said. 
</P>
<P>
Choice is based in Pasadena and serves the San Gabriel Valley and Riverside 
areas. Its other owners are Donrey Media of Las Vegas and Howard Publishing of 
Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
Cencom has about 400,000 customers, mostly in the St. Louis area, making it the 
30th-largest cable system in the country, Nathanson said. 
</P>
<P>
Nathanson, president of Falcon Cablesystems of Los Angeles, would not disclose 
the price of the deal. When it was revealed in May that Choice was on the 
block, analysts said the system could bring more than $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
At the time ML Opportunity Partners, an investment vehicle set up by Merrill 
Lynch Capital Markets, was identified as the leading candidate to acquire 
Choice. 
</P>
<P>
Nathanson said he and the other owners plan to reinvest proceeds from the deal 
into the cable business. 
</P>
<P>
Choice was spun off from Falcon in 1982. Falcon currently is the 17th-largest 
cable company in the country, Nathanson said.

BOB HOPE STEPS UP TO THE PLATE FOR BIG A HONOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With his customary mix of wit and charm, comedic legend Bob Hope accepted 
accolades Thursday night at Anaheim Stadium for his longstanding commitment to 
the nation's military -- and just as quickly turned this attention back to the 
service members themselves. 
</P>
<P>
It was Armed Forces Night at the stadium, as the Angels continued a weeklong 
celebration before Tuesday's All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
And the man of the hour was Hope, 86, who since the outset of World War II has 
spent thousands of hours entertaining U.S. troops worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Selfless Service' 
</P>
<P>
It was for this "unprecedented, loyal and selfless service" to the military 
that Orange County Centennial Committee representative Darrell Metzger honored 
Hope at Thursday's ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
But Hope, ushered to home plate in an Army jeep, quickly turned the tables, 
using the occasion to salute the 3,000 military personnel who stood ramrod 
straight behind him. 
</P>
<P>
"Just to see this many servicemen brings back a lot of memories to me," Hope 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the display around him, Hope said that while people may now legally burn 
the American flag, "they will never burn the spirit behind that banner." 
</P>
<P>
Hope saved his only jokes of the night for Angels owner and former Western star 
Gene Autry, whom he called a "Donald Trump with saddle sores." 
</P>
<P>
It was Autry, Hope quipped, who "taught Ronnie Reagan how to ride a horse," a 
reference to the former President's being thrown from a bucking horse while 
hunting on a friend's ranch in northern Mexico on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony ended with the 82nd Airborne Chorus singing Hope's signature song, 
"Thanks for the Memory." 
</P>
<P>
A scheduled flyby performance by California Air National Guard F-4E Phantom 
jets was canceled because of an accident at March Air Force Base involving an 
F-4, according to ceremony host Johnny Grant. 
</P>
<P>
Grant, who is directing the Angels' weeklong All-Star celebration, said that 
when he was asked "who I thought they should honor, I said, 'For Armed Forces 
night, there is only one person -- and that is Bob Hope.' "

</P>
<P>
ANAHEIM CLASSIC STIRS MEMORIES OF 1967 GAME AND BABE RUTH-WALTER JOHNSON 
CONFRONTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LANDSBAUM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember way back when the All-Star game was first played in Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
Dave Sommers remembers. He was one of 46,309 fans nestled comfortably in their 
seats at the nearly new Anaheim Stadium on July 11, 1967, when the Big A 
marquee stood right behind the outfield fence and when there was no permanent 
seating behind center field. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Clair remembers. He was there too. He even has a memento of the game, a 
program that sold for 50 cents at the gate. This year's All-Star program costs 
$5. 
</P>
<P>
And 89-year-old Ernie Johnson remembers. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson wasn't at Anaheim Stadium in 1967 when the National League 
All-Stars clipped the American League All-Stars 2-1 in 15 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson recalls an Orange County all-star baseball game a few years earlier -- 
1924 to be exact. That was when a barnstorming team headed by New York Yankee 
immortal Babe Ruth played in Brea against another touring team captained by 
favorite son Walter Johnson of the Washington Senators, who, like Ruth, ended 
up in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I can lay claim to is that I was there when Babe Ruth and 
Walter Johnson played," said Johnson, president of Brea Canyon Oil Co. and no 
relation to the illustrious pitcher. "I was quite a follower of Babe Ruth and 
Johnson. They put on quite a show." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson the oil man said that Johnson the pitcher grew up in Olinda, which is 
known today as Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
"He persuaded Babe Ruth to come," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
On that November day nearly 65 years ago, Ruth hit a home run off a Johnson 
pitch but another time he went down swinging. "He could throw that ball hard," 
Johnson said of the pitcher. Nevertheless, Ruth's team won 12-1. 
</P>
<P>
"When Babe Ruth struck at that ball and he missed it, he turned clear around," 
recalled Johnson, one of 5,000 to 16,000 Orange County residents on hand that 
day, depending on which yellowing newspaper account you believe. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball's quite a thing," Johnson concluded. "It attracts a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
One of those who will resist the attraction of this year's All-Star game is 
Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley. Like Johnson and Johnson (Walter and 
Ernie, that is), Riley played baseball as a young man and has remained a fan. 
But Riley will miss the midsummer classic in Anaheim just as he did in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"Just this morning, I had a call from a friend who invited me to sit in their 
box," Riley said. "I have tickets, but I'm going to give them to a member of 
the staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I am pretty much of a baseball fan . . . but Emma Jane (his wife) is not such 
an enthusiastic fan. We sort of compromised and will forgo this one." 
</P>
<P>
Had Riley an opportunity to attend the 1967 game, however, he would have leaped 
at the chance, he said. At that time he was recently retired from the Marine 
Corps and vice president of a Newport Beach manufacturing company. 
</P>
<P>
Riley does not recall the hoopla that led up to the 1967 game. But he clearly 
has noted the changes in Orange County that have taken place since. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us are still having difficulty with that feeling that we are really 
big boys now," Riley said. "We are really an urban county, second or third 
largest in the state, depending on which day you count." 
</P>
<P>
"We've developed that tremendous stadium. We've really developed a whole lot." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you think it was kind of a remarkable thing that we had 63,000 people?" 
Riley said of the Fourth of July crowd at the stadium for the California 
Angels' game and fireworks display. 
</P>
<P>
Like Orange County, Anaheim Stadium has grown in the past 22 years. The 1989 
All-Star game is a sellout, but there will be about 17,000 more seats occupied 
this year than at the 1967 sellout, a dozen years before the addition of two 
tiers of seating beyond the outfield fences. 
</P>
<P>
Another difference this year is that Genevieve Linhoff plans to see the entire 
game from her seat -- and a choice location it is too, right down in the front 
row, smack behind the American League third-base dugout. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, Linhoff missed about three innings of the game when unexpected 
last-minute emergencies required her to help out in the stadium ticket office 
where she was employed as secretary to the ticket manager. This year she is 
assistant ticket manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be sitting in the seats this time. I'm going to see the whole 
game," Linhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Anaheim has changed" since 1967, Linhoff said. "We were more intimate 
. . . now we're big. Particularly at the stadium. You knew so many of the 
customers. We had fewer people." 
</P>
<P>
Like so many baseball fans, Linhoff is a traditionalist. She wasn't even real 
fond of expanding stadium seating and moving the distinctive Big A from behind 
center field to exile in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like that too well, but it's progress, more capacity," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Johnson recalled how progress altered forever another Orange County 
baseball tradition. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1920s a large crowd used to gather outside an Anaheim coffeehouse, 
where the proprietor kept the baseball-hungry throng posted on play-by-play 
developments of the World Series by relaying telegraph bulletins from the East. 
</P>
<P>
On a large board erected outside the eating establishment, the restaurateur had 
denoted bases, the outfield and the players. 
</P>
<P>
"We stood on the opposite side of the street and watched it and sat on the 
curb," Johnson recalled. "He got the reports by telegraph, and he played the 
game out." 
</P>
<P>
"He had . . . lights and he'd ring a bell when there was a hit and he'd tell 
who the batter was. He yelled it out through that window." 
</P>
<P>
Alas, progress intervened and in later years radios became commonplace. There 
soon was always someone who would have more up-to-the-minute news than could be 
provided by the quaint coffee-shop scoreboard, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"That began to kind of spoil the thing a little bit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Back to the future. Johnson intends to attend Tuesday's All-Star game. Like 
Supervisor Riley, he missed the one in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Even if his wife were enthusiastic about attending, Riley has decided that 
considering "the traffic and all involved, I think I'd feel better if I watched 
it at home" on television.

ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: SANTA ANA HEIGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
7 AIRPORT-AREA HOMES ADDED TO NOISE LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A slight increase in average noise levels at John Wayne Airport has added seven 
homes to a list of 73 in the Santa Ana Heights area that must be insulated or 
removed from residential use under state regulations, airport officials said 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the homes will be insulated, purchased by the county or be 
rezoned as business-use land. The seven homes are in the area of Pegasus and 
Indus streets and Orchard Drive. 
</P>
<P>
So far, four of the 80 residences now in the noise impact zone have been bought 
by the county; the remainder are at various stages of processing for either 
insulation or purchase by the county. 
</P>
<P>
No specific reason was found for the slight noise increase during the period 
from Jan. 1 to March 31, although officials reported major technical problems 
that resulted in repairs to one of the noise-monitoring devices stationed in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
And actual average daily jet operations -- takeoffs and landings -- decreased 
slightly from 206 in the previous quarter to 205 during the three months ending 
March 31, according to a study released by the airport staff. In the first 
quarter of 1988, the daily average was 206 jet operations. 
</P>
<P>
Although average noise levels had increased, the number of citizen complaints 
declined 22% during the first quarter of 1989, county noise abatement officials 
said, compared to the previous quarter, and were down 6.8% compared to the 
first three months of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, county officials said, complaints have peaked during increased 
political activity involving airport planning decisions, but otherwise have not 
necessarily followed a particular pattern.

DAWN OF 6/7/89; 
</P>
<P>
GROUP SEES 'EARTH RISE DAY' AS START OF ENVIRONMENTAL TURNAROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
With incense burning around them, nine Laguna Beach residents sat in a circle 
at sunrise Thursday and meditated, uttering "om" as cars zoomed by on nearby 
Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
"From this day forward," artist Gene Maslow told the group, "our lives will 
change, our earth will be renewed." 
</P>
<P>
They gathered to observe an auspicious occasion: It was the sixth day of the 
seventh month of the 89th year. In the United States, it is noted as 7/6/89. 
Elsewhere in the world, it is marked as 6/7/89. 
</P>
<P>
Such sequential order on the calendar happens only once every 11 years, Maslow 
said. Those at the sunrise meditation hoped that this would mark the start of 
11 years of new environmental consciousness around the world. Thus, they and 
other groups in several other countries have declared the date "Earth Rise 
Day," targeting it as the dawn of an environmental turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
As the sun started to peak through the typical morning fog, Maslow, the 
director of Artists for the Environment in Laguna Beach, recited several lines 
from "Savitri," a 23,000-line poem created by a language expert from India. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw them cross the twilight of an age," he read, "the sun-eyed children of a 
marvelous dawn." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evening Rites 
</P>
<P>
Participants, dressed in jogging outfits and saris, sat on sheets of white 
paper. One man played a flute. A red-bearded man with a headband clutched 
crystals in both hands. A barefoot man with his knees and face on the ground 
grasped fistfuls of sand. 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Milette, 30, her daughter, Lani, 8, and their friend, Diona Alonge, 17, 
concluded the meditation with a dance they created called "Prayer Dance for the 
Earth." 
</P>
<P>
The gathering was only one event that was held at "The Tell," a 600-foot-long, 
28-foot-high photo mural along Laguna Canyon Road that was created by area 
artists. Thursday evening's events featured dances, music and mimes. 
</P>
<P>
The mural has become a meeting place for artists and environmental activists 
hoping to preserve the area from developers who want to build new homes and 
widen roads. But the participants used the occasion to focus their energies on 
recognizing what they call Gaia, or the female aspect of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"As people focus their understanding on what should happen, they awaken their 
inner life," Maslow said after the event. "We are all, in this day, working for 
this, the sun-eyed children." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Rose Marie Seaney, an area author and activist, said that the energy from 
Earth Rise Day would be transferred to others through such meditation. "There 
is a heck of a lot of energy," she said. "People gather together and get this 
energy. It will certainly go toward the environment." 
</P>
<P>
For Maslow, it was not his first celebration of what he believes to be a 
numerically significant date. Maslow was in India on May 4, 1967, or 4/5/67. He 
said thousands attended a silent vigil there with The Mother, Sri Aurobindo 
Ashram, an Indian environmental activist he said was "the most dynamic 
representation of the mother force on earth. With her special power and force 
we all opened to a new consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Premature' Celebration 
</P>
<P>
While he was in India, Maslow was one of the original settlers of Auroville, a 
township that now has 600 inhabitants. A celebration was also scheduled to take 
place there Thursday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
For those in the United States who marked the date on June 7, 1989, their 
celebrations were premature, Maslow said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a warp on that one," Maslow said. "The proper, official one is 
happening today."

SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO RENT CONTROL UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A recent appeals court decision has upheld San Juan Capistrano's action two 
years ago to restrict rent increases at a local mobile-home park. But the legal 
battle may continue. 
</P>
<P>
San Juan Capistrano City Atty. John R. Shaw said in a letter to officials this 
week that the city "won a sweeping victory on every point" in a recent appeals 
court decision upholding city action on rent control at the Capistrano Terrace 
Mobile Home Park. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jim P. Mahacek, the attorney for the mobile-home park owner, said 
Thursday that "we are very, very seriously considering an appeal to the (state) 
Supreme Court." 
</P>
<P>
In a decision filed June 29, the 4th District Court of Appeal ruled in favor of 
the city and against Richard A. Hall, the owner of Capistrano Terrace Mobile 
Home Park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disagreed With City 
</P>
<P>
Hall, who purchased the 150-tenant mobile-home park in 1985, disagreed with the 
City Council's action in 1987 to restrict him to a 3% rent increase for his 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Hall sought unsuccessfully to get a court order in his favor in Orange County 
Superior Court, and he appealed the case to the Court of Appeal. In its June 29 
ruling, the appellate court said, "The monthly rentals generated by this park, 
combined with the tax advantages inherent in property ownership, is more than 
enough to satisfy a reasonable investor, at least for the relatively short 
term," until it begins to make a profit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Losing Money on Park 
</P>
<P>
The park's attorney said Thursday that the court's decision acknowledges that 
Hall will be losing money on the park for a period of time. Mahacek said the 
state Supreme Court has never defined how long it is constitutionally 
permissible for a landowner to be deprived of a profit under rent control. He 
said the appeal is being considered on those constitutional grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We have 30 days to decide whether to appeal," Mahacek said. "We are not 
attacking the legality of the rent-control ordinance. What we are attacking is 
the method in which it was applied in this case." 
</P>
<P>
City Atty. Shaw, in his letter this week, called the appellate court decision 
"a major victory upholding the integrity of the rent-adjustment process in San 
Juan Capistrano." Shaw added, "The key part of the decision appears to rest 
heavily on the court's view that Hall would sustain a negative cash flow only 
for a limited duration."

JAILBREAK SUSPECT PLEADS INNOCENT TO PLANNING ESCAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY HICKS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Lee Taylor, a suspected armed robber and jewel thief whose escape from 
Orange County Jail last year triggered a national manhunt, pleaded innocent 
Thursday to charges that he planned the daring breakout of five inmates from 
the jail roof. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, 36, entered innocent pleas to charges of felony escape, kidnap and 
robbery and was ordered to appear before Municipal Judge James M. Brooks in 
Santa Ana on July 19 for a preliminary hearing on the escape-related charges. 
He was being held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Robbery, Assault Counts 
</P>
<P>
Taylor is scheduled to return to Municipal Court in Westminster today so a 
preliminary hearing can be scheduled on the charges that put him in jail 
originally: seven counts of armed robbery and two counts of assault with a 
deadly weapon in jewelry store robberies in four county cities. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said the preliminary hearing on the escape-related charges may be 
combined with the preliminary hearing on the original charges. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor is accused of taking more than $100,000 in gems during the county 
robberies. He is also charged with other crimes, including allegations of 
raping a robbery victim, while fleeing cross-country after his escape. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor and four other inmates escaped from the recreation area of the men's 
jail in downtown Santa Ana by rappelling down sheets from the top of the 
four-story building. Two inmates were captured shortly after, and two others 
were caught two weeks later in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
One deputy was fired and another was disciplined shortly after the escape, and 
jail officials admitted that security had been lax. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, meanwhile, eluded arrest and eventually was the subject of an 
"America's Most Wanted" TV program May 7. Shortly after the broadcast aired, 
several viewers in western South Dakota called the Fox Television Network and 
said they had spotted the fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities tracked Taylor down to Rapid City, S.D., after he tried to pawn 
diamonds that police believe were stolen from a Chicago jewelry store. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since his capture, Taylor has maintained that he was forced to escape from 
the jail because of its poor living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
He told a Times Orange County Edition reporter this week that since his return 
to the jail he has been threatened by deputies but not physically harmed. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said the deputies told him: "If you look the wrong way, you're going to 
be smothered with us." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "I just don't want to be beaten in here and never get out alive." 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department's spokesman, Lt. Richard J. Olson, said Thursday that 
Taylor, who also goes by the name Anthony M. Gianetti, has been placed in a 
high-security cell. 
</P>
<P>
Olson denied Taylor's assertions about jail deputies.

HUNGER STRIKE PAYS OFF; VISA OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Westminster couple's four-day hunger strike in front of a federal immigration 
office came to a happy ending Thursday afternoon when top immigration officials 
said the woman's ailing mother will be allowed to emigrate from Romania to the 
United States after all. 
</P>
<P>
"God Bless these men for helping this poor woman get here," the sunburned and 
unshaven Vasile Sofroni said at the end of his 80-hour fast in Westminster to 
win an entry visa for his mother-in-law, Livia Groza, 54. 
</P>
<P>
"My legs are shaking. I don't know if it's from lack of food or from 
happiness," he said outside the INS office in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Ezell, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service's western 
regional commissioner, told Sofroni and his wife, Lia, both 31, that acting INS 
Commissioner James Buck had personally reviewed Groza's case Thursday morning 
in Washington. Ezell said Buck decided that Groza did qualify for a special 
humanitarian visa. 
</P>
<P>
Ezell said the visa means that Groza, who has a serious heart condition and 
hasn't been able to work for five years, can now legally come to the United 
States and stay indefinitely. He explained that the government, on rare 
occasions, grants special visas for humanitarian reasons, to aliens who 
otherwise cannot legally enter the United States with a regular immigrant visa. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's decision is in line with our policy to promote family unity by 
offering special consideration. . . . This family should be together here in 
the United States," Ezell said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The Sofronis launched their fast in the INS parking lot at 5 a.m. Monday after 
three years of efforts, including assistance from Rep. Robert K. Dornan 
(R-Garden Grove), failed to win entry for Groza. 
</P>
<P>
Vasile Sofroni said he had become increasingly concerned about his 
mother-in-law's welfare when money he sent failed to reach her in Dimisoara, 
Romania. 
</P>
<P>
The INS originally denied Groza's petition for a humanitarian visa in early 
May, saying that she was still young enough to support herself and therefore 
did not have to be with her closest living relatives, the Sofronis, who have 
permanent U.S. residency status, the couple said. 
</P>
<P>
Ezell said that Groza's case, which was being handled by the INS office in 
Washington, came to his attention when he saw a local TV news broadcast 
Wednesday night about the couple's hunger strike. 
</P>
<P>
Ezell said that both he and Dornan called acting INS Commissioner Buck early 
Thursday and asked him to personally examine the request. 
</P>
<P>
Buck interceded, overruling other INS officials to whom the Sofronis had been 
appealing for various entry visas for about three years. Ezell said the INS 
already has sent a cable to the U.S. Embassy in Romania, advising officials 
there that a visa has been approved. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a belated Fourth of July gift to the Sofronis. We talked to Mr. Buck 
and explained that the State Department had already given the OK," said 
Patricia Fanelli, a Dornan aide. She said the congressman has been working on 
Groza's case since last year. 
</P>
<P>
Sofroni said Thursday that he and his wife were driven to fasting because 
Dornan's office "promised all this time, and they keep trying, but nothing 
changed. (We got) the same answers," and because Groza was not getting the 
money they were sending to Romania. 
</P>
<P>
" 'I don't know what you are doing, Vasile, but I see nothing from you,' " he 
said his mother-in-law told him in a telephone conversation in April. 
</P>
<P>
That is when Sofroni said he decided to act. "I said no more waiting. . . . If 
I don't help her, she is going to die because nobody else there to help her." 
</P>
<P>
INS officials emphasized that without valid grounds for granting a humanitarian 
visa request, the hunger strike would have done no good. 
</P>
<P>
"The hunger strike was not the reason parole status was granted. . . . There 
was a lot of hard evidence to support their claim in the second review," INS 
spokesman Ron Rogers said.

TOURNAMENT AT HUNTINGTON BEACH DRAWS TOP YOUNG SURFERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Some of the world's top 21-and-under surfers will compete in the first Surf and 
Street Mechanics pro-am championships Saturday near the Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
The $5,000 event, created by Professional Surfing Assn. of America competitors 
John Parmenter and Bud Llamas, both of Huntington Beach, has attracted about 64 
competitors, 32 of them professional, from throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of competition where young amateurs compete against some of the top 
pros is very popular in Australia, but it is very rare in the United States," 
Parmenter said. "After watching the Australians run this event successfully for 
so many years, I felt that it is time that we had such a competition here in 
the United States." 
</P>
<P>
Dino Andino, 21, of San Clemente, who finished second in the PSAA overall 
standings last year to two-time defending champion Mike Lambresi, will be one 
of the pros competing Saturday. Competition begins at 7:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those expected to challenge Andino include Chris Brown of Santa 
Barbara, the PSAA's top 17-year-old, Vinnie De La Pena of Dana Point, who won a 
PSAA event on June 4 in Oceanside; Juan Ashton, 20, of Puerto Rico and Noah 
Budroe, 21, of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Shane Beschen, 17, of San Clemente, who finished fifth in a PSAA pro-am event 
February in Puerto Rico, will be among the amateurs competing. Other amateur 
competitors include C.C. Betcheloff, 17, of Huntington Beach and 12-year-old 
Craig Etchegoyen of Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
"Amateurs like the challenge of surfing against the pros," Beschen said. "Pros 
come to this kind of competition thinking that it's going to be easier for 
them, but we want to prove that we can compete effectively against them." 
</P>
<P>
The first-place finisher will receive $2,000. The runner-up will get $1,000 and 
the third-place contestant will pick up $500. Proceeds from the event will 
benefit the Surfrider Foundation, a Huntington Beach organization that was 
formed in 1987 to fight ocean pollution, Parmenter said. 
</P>
<P>
Competition will take place all day, with the finals scheduled for 4:30 p.m. AL

An Orange County investors group said Thursday it has bought the bankrupt 
Registry Hotel in Irvine for $26 million and plans to renovate the closed, 
293-room hotel and begin operating it in October as a Radisson Plaza franchise. 
</P>
<P>
GMY Investment Co., a Newport Beach limited partnership of five investors, said 
it bought the hotel June 29 from Homestead Savings &amp; Loan in San Francisco, 
the principal creditor of the Registry, and immediately changed its name to the 
Radisson Plaza Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The Registry, which was the first upscale hotel near John Wayne Airport when it 
opened in 1976, abruptly closed Feb. 8 and laid off its 230 workers after 
failing to find a buyer or make a required debt payment. 
</P>
<P>
The investor group that bought the hotel last week said Aref Haffar, a former 
vice president of Servico, a hotel management company based in Florida, has 
been chosen as the hotel's managing director. 
</P>
<P>
Homestead officials could not be reached Thursday for comment. John Craddock, 
senior vice president of Radisson Hotels International Inc., confirmed that the 
Minneapolis hotel firm last week approved a franchise agreement with GMY. 
</P>
<P>
Craddock said Radisson had been looking at least two years for a hotel 
franchise in the vicinity of the airport and considered the Registry, on 
MacArthur Boulevard across from the airport, to have "a fabulous location." 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine hotel and an all-suite facility being built near Cal State Fullerton 
represent Radisson's entry into Orange County. Craddock said he is also 
negotiating another franchise in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Radisson has 204 hotels worldwide, including 135 in the United States, most of 
which are in the Midwest and East. 
</P>
<P>
Through a franchising program begun in 1985, Craddock said, the company has 
started a vigorous expansion. 
</P>
<P>
He said Radisson is expanding its hotel chain fastest in California, where it 
already has agreements to add 16 franchise hotels from Ventura County to the 
Mexican border by 1990. 
</P>
<P>
He said the firm is also negotiating five or six more Southern California 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
Craddock said Radisson realizes that the hotel in Irvine is in a very 
competitive market and intends to give it "strong support," including access to 
the chain's national reservation system and referrals from the company's sister 
travel agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Radisson is a division of the Carlson Cos., a diversified firm with annual 
revenue of $5 billion. Carlson has a large travel component, including the Ask 
Mr. Foster and Neiman Marcus Travel agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Sandra Louvier, a hotel specialist for the Laventhol &amp; Horwath accounting 
firm in Costa Mesa, said it would "definitely be positive for the hotel to have 
a chain name and a national reservation system." 
</P>
<P>
She said the Registry fell on hard times as a result of intense competition in 
the airport area. In 1985-87, more than 1,000 rooms a year were added to the 
luxury hotel market in the area, according to Laventhol &amp; Horwath. 
</P>
<P>
Louvier said the hotel also suffered when it had to redirect customers to 
other, newer hotels during renovation. When the renovation was over, she said, 
the hotel could not lure back all its former customers. 
</P>
<P>
Haffar, the hotel's new managing director, said the new owners intend to spend 
$2 million to $3 million on further renovations before the hotel reopens. 
</P>
<P>
He said the owners will paint the building, refurbish the entry and lobby and 
remodel guest rooms to include special features for business travelers, 
including two telephone lines and wiring for computers and fax machines. 
</P>
<P>
He said plans also call for adding a second ballroom and more meeting space.

Koll Co., the big Newport Beach developer, said it would build a $50-million, 
11-story office tower in partnership with a Japanese company at Koll Center 
Irvine near John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Koll said it would start construction in August near Von Karman Avenue and 
Michelson Drive. The building will be a duplicate of the Transamerica Building, 
a white, precast concrete office tower built four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Koll's partner in the building is Zenitaka Corp., which acquired the 
joint-venture rights from Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Cos. 
</P>
<P>
Zenitaka, a 100-year-old contractor, acquired in the same deal the 
joint-venture rights with Koll to a second site nearby, Koll said. Both sites 
are next to the Transamerica building and the five-story Marine National Bank 
building, which are joint ventures of Koll and the life insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
Gensler &amp; Associates designed the new, 234,500-square-foot building, which 
is scheduled for completion in 1990, Koll said. 
</P>
<P>
Koll Center Irvine is a 104-acre, $1-billion office and retailing center on 
both sides of the San Diego Freeway at Von Karman Avenue. The new building will 
be the 13th in the center.

2 IMMIGRANTS NOW LIVING IN ORANGE COUNTY ENTER THE NEW FIELD OF TALKING YELLOW 
PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When Vladimir Berelson and Boris Kushnir left the Soviet Union a decade ago, 
that nation's telephones were outmoded, computers were virtually non-existent, 
and the telephone book was still a dream. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the two men live in Orange County, and they have combined all three 
elements in a state-of-the-art referral service known as talking yellow pages. 
</P>
<P>
Berelson and Kushnir launched On-Line Yellow Pages last Saturday and made 20 to 
30 referrals a day from a computer data base that includes telephone numbers, 
addresses and short descriptions of more than 1,500 businesses in south Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 40 advertisers have paid $200 or more to be listed with Kushnir's and 
Berelson's Lake Forest-based business. Consumers in search of a service or a 
store can call their toll-free 800 number and are referred to one of the 
companies that has bought a listing. 
</P>
<P>
If no company has sponsored an ad in a given category, the caller is referred 
to a non-paying company. 
</P>
<P>
Kushnir and Berelson, brothers-in-law who left their native Odessa in 1979, 
believe that their service will succeed because Americans have too much of a 
good thing. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many telephone books in the area that you never have the right 
book available when you need it," Kushnir said. "And even if you do, it's bulky 
and inaccessible, so we think our service will be very useful." 
</P>
<P>
After moving to the United States, Kushnir worked for several local companies. 
In 1984, he opened a design business with his wife, Alla. Berelson worked as a 
quality-control expert at several local companies. 
</P>
<P>
The men started discussing the idea of a talking yellow pages 2 1/2 years ago 
and have been researching local businesses and competitors ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Five operators will work around the clock from their Lake Forest headquarters 
to answer calls from consumers. 
</P>
<P>
'We call it high tech with a personalized touch," Berelson said. 
</P>
<P>
Talking yellow pages first appeared about four years ago in the United States 
and Canada. Presently, there are 15 to 20 in general service, according to Dan 
Maitland, president of BDR AudioTex, a Toronto-based company that provides 
talking yellow pages services. 
</P>
<P>
Two companies have failed in attempts to begin similar yellow page services in 
Orange County. A third, Los Angeles-based Primex Talking Yellow Pages, has 
functioned throughout Los Angeles and Orange counties since late 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Amin, President of Primex, said his company's switchboard attracts 
15,000 calls a day from across the metropolitan area and its advertising budget 
has swelled from $10,000 per month to $100,000 per month over the last four 
years. He said the company is presently making a profit but declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Primex has specialized in providing information on professionals such as 
doctors and lawyers, and its advertising prices, which begin at $350, are 
higher than those of Kushnir and Berelson. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard to beat the Yellow Pages at what they do," Maitland said. "It's 
difficult to make this work unless you're backed up by the telephone company." 
</P>
<P>
The telephone companies are prohibited from entering the audio-referral market 
until 1992. Maitland said he believes that talking yellow pages cannot succeed 
on a large scale until the telephone companies bring their massive resources to 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
Mark McCourt, owner of Freeline Inc., a Mission Viejo-based company that 
recently dropped out of the business, said the high cost of advertising was his 
downfall. He said his service attracted up to 300 calls a day, but he didn't 
have the money to adequately advertise the business and increase demand. 
</P>
<P>
He still maintains that talking yellow pages will eventually dominate the 
telephone-directory business because it is easier for consumers to call a 
referral company than locate one in the many ungainly phone books. 
</P>
<P>
"Talking yellow pages are a vastly superior way of doing business, but to make 
people change the way they have always done things will take a 
multimillion-dollar advertising effort," McCourt suggested. 
</P>
<P>
To beat the marketing problem, Berelson and Kushnir have focused on just a 
portion of Orange County. They plan to spend about $100,000 over the next four 
months to advertise their service on cable television, radio and in 
neighborhood newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 40 customers they have attracted so far, most also advertise in the more 
expensive Yellow Pages, Kushnir said. 
</P>
<P>
Kimberly Seiver, co-owner of Five Star Limousine in El Toro, said the On-Line 
Yellow Pages costs $300 per month for a full-service contract, compared to $600 
for the Yellow Pages. She also said it has more potential for attracting 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
"They made us an offer we couldn't refuse,," Seiver said. "We advertise in the 
Yellow Pages, but they don't have people around 24 hours a day with our 
business listed first." 
</P>
<P>
Kushnir and Berelson said they hope to cover the entire county by October and 
attract 2,000 to 3,000 calls a day by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"Some day, we are planning to expand to the Soviet Union," Kushnir said. "That 
would be a real step toward perestroika."

ALL-STAR GAME THE -- BIG A;

STADIUM REVIEW;

<P>
BIG A IS NOT SHEA, A MIXED BLESSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The first time I ever went to a major-league baseball game, some wise guy 
ticket taker at Yankee Stadium sized me up, looked me over and declared that I 
must be a midget. 
</P>
<P>
I was not amused, as 5-year-old boys are prone not to be when their manhood is 
challenged in public. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe that's one reason why I became a Mets fan. But Shea Stadium held its 
indignities too. The worst of them was the seating ritual, in which an usher 
dressed in Mets orange and blue would walk you to your seat, slap it down from 
its folded position, swipe at it with a filthy orange muff, then hang around 
waiting to be tipped for his ministrations. (It must be said, though, that the 
Shea ushers' greed could also work in your favor: For a few bucks' grease 
money, you could get an usher to relocate you from, say, a remote vantage point 
in the upper deck to a nicely situated loge box behind home plate.) 
</P>
<P>
I thought back on those old New York ballpark ways Monday night as I nestled 
into my seat at Anaheim Stadium for a California Angels-Texas Rangers game. 
Instead of running a gantlet of baksheesh and verbal abuse, I encountered: a 
parking gate attendant who gave me a crisp "Welcome to Anaheim Stadium!" along 
with my change; a young ticket seller who threw in a bright "Have fun!" at no 
extra charge, and, best of all, a white-haired usher who said, "Hi there, how 
you doing?" then pointed the way to my seat without any hint that he thought he 
deserved an extra two bits for providing clear directions and a hearty 
greeting. 
</P>
<P>
As the game went on, I walked the stadium, sizing it up from different angles, 
trying to get some fix on its character. The Big A has some obvious flaws. The 
scoreboard is dominated by a garish, far too expansive array of ad billboards 
(including one for this newspaper). 
</P>
<P>
And the place is simply too big. When it opened in 1966, it had 43,259 seats -- 
a nice, cozy capacity for baseball -- in a horseshoe configuration. In 1980, to 
accommodate the National Football League's Rams, the horseshoe was converted 
into a full circle, and the stadium's coziness was compromised as seating 
expanded to 64,593, second in baseball only to Cleveland's cavernous Municipal 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
There is something discouraging about sitting in a baseball crowd of nearly 
30,000 people -- Monday night's attendance -- and seeing a stadium that is more 
than half empty. Southern Californians are getting to know quite well that 
bigness saps charm. The Too-Big A is a prime example. 
</P>
<P>
Physical layout aside, Anaheim Stadium excels with such virtues as the 
aforementioned staff friendliness, the stadium's overall cleanliness (it seems 
remarkably new for a 23-year-old building) and its abundance of food and snack 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
(For the record, I passed on the Mexican food stand, the baked potatoes, the 
sausages, the pizza, the fish and chips, the international beer concession, the 
mixed-drink bars and the ice cream parlor. I visited the Seafood Bar and found 
the shrimp cocktail no better than the sauce-drenched frozen stuff they sell in 
jars at the supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
(I had a kosher-style hot dog and found it tasty, if pricey -- $2.50 for an 
ordinary-size dog. Condiments are of crucial importance to the hot dog eater, 
and Anaheim Stadium rates a Big A on that score, with easy access to tubs of 
mustard, ketchup, relish, onions and chili peppers. I, for one, would rather 
tip an usher who calls me a midget than be forced to squeeze mustard out of 
plastic packets). 
</P>
<P>
A ballpark, however, is much more than the measure of its physical attributes 
and its consumer conveniences. The soul of a stadium, like the soul of a human 
being, is intangible. It lives in memories and traditions -- sparked by moments 
of history made on the field and lodged for a lifetime in the instant-replay 
camera of the mind. 
</P>
<P>
To find a ballpark's soul, one must consider the team that plays in it and the 
intensity of that team's hold on its fans. 
</P>
<P>
In 28 predominantly bad-to-mediocre seasons (five in Los Angeles preceded the 
move to Anaheim), the Angels, a team that has never reached the World Series, 
have failed to provide many of the vivid snapshots or glorious traditions that 
can make even the surliest ushers and the mealiest frankfurters seem like minor 
blemishes. 
</P>
<P>
But true baseball fans are a loyal and hopeful lot, willing to replay a few 
vivid moments until new ones come along. Those devoted and patient loyalists 
were not hard to find at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
John Bower, a season ticket holder since 1983, clings to Oct. 12, 1986, the day 
the Angels came within one strike of winning the American League pennant, only 
to wind up losing to the Boston Red Sox. That playoff defeat may have been 
bitter, but it was Anaheim Stadium's signal moment in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not come to the stadium since that day without thinking of that game at 
least once," said Bower, 28, an accountant who grew up in Orange County and 
lives in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
One row behind Bower in the upper-deck tier high above first base, another 
season ticket holder, Dave Saldana, bellowed at the Angels as they fell behind 
the Rangers, 1-0. "Come on, boneheads, wake up!" he screamed. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the fans around him let the on-field setback slide by without comment. 
But Saldana, a 26-year-old pre-med student at UC Irvine, said that taking great 
umbrage at the Angels is a family tradition -- his grandfather, who brought him 
to Anaheim Stadium as a small boy, was not reluctant to cuss out the home team 
when it stumbled. 
</P>
<P>
"I really love this team a lot," Saldana said. "I get on 'em because I think 
they can do better." 
</P>
<P>
Most Angels fans are not so demanding, the upper-deck denizens agreed. "It 
would be nice one day to see the intensity of the East Coast fans here," said 
Bower, who has been to games in New York, Boston and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
"We joke around that there's still this atmosphere here of people meeting in an 
open-air bar. They're not here to watch the game, they're here to drink and 
socialize." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of trying to make themselves felt as an independent force, most Angels 
fans seemed content to be guided by authority, as if they were campers waiting 
for cues from their counselors. The scoreboard is the counselor, leading cheers 
by displaying exhortations along the lines of "Let's Make Some Noise," while 
the stadium organist plinks out rhythmic cadences to focus the noisemaking (the 
organist got to be more creative when Texas had to change pitchers, serenading 
the hapless hurlers with choruses of "So Long, It's Been Good to Know You," 
"Happy Trails to You" and "Another One Bites the Dust"). 
</P>
<P>
There was some spontaneous mass rooting. A chant -- sans scoreboard assistance 
-- of "Wally, Wally" began when Wally Joyner, one of the Angels' best players, 
came to bat with men on base. And a low rumbling of discontent arose when 
relief pitcher Bryan Harvey worked himself into last-inning trouble before 
settling down to save a 5-2 Angels victory. 
</P>
<P>
One girl out in the alcohol-free Family Section behind the left field fence had 
brought a homemade sign that said "Chili," in honor of Angels outfielder Chili 
Davis. That's commonplace at many ballparks, but at Anaheim Stadium the placard 
wavers appeared to be outnumbered by the folks who brought inflatable beach 
balls to bat around in the stands, and the upper-level fans who took time out 
for another Anaheim Stadium diversion: peering over the wall to watch the 
nightly fireworks display at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
The surest formula for heating up fan intensity and bringing history and 
honorable tradition to Anaheim Stadium would, of course, be a rise to 
excellence on the Angels' part. That's no easy order, but there is something 
the Angels could do to raise the intensity level around here in one simple 
stroke: 
</P>
<P>
They could make a pitch for local pride by dropping the vague, shilly-shallying 
"California Angels" name. Hasn't Orange County finally come of age as a 
community worthy of being bannered throughout the baseball-loving world -- even 
on days when the All-Star game isn't being played here? 
</P>
<P>
"Anaheim Angels" would be a nicely alliterative name, but "Orange County 
Angels" -- a snappy "OC Angels" for short -- would be even better. They might 
be Our Champs or Our Chumps, but at least they would be openly, unabashedly 
Ours.

A LOOK AT THE MYSTERY OF INDIA'S INDEPENDENCE; 
</P>
<P>
RUSHDIE'S 'RIDDLE' UNFOLDS IN DOCUMENTARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES ENDRST, Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is cruel but fair to say that Salman Rushdie's career owes much to the late 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
It was not "The Satanic Verses" but the death sentence imposed by Khomeini that 
boosted Rushdie's book sales, made the author a living martyr for free 
expression and -- because he was forced into hiding, where he remains -- made 
him a mystery man as well. 
</P>
<P>
And when, on Sunday, cable's Discovery Channel presents "The Riddle of 
Midnight," a 90-minute documentary on India based on Rushdie's 1980 novel, 
"Midnight's Children," there is no doubt that many people will be tuning in to 
get a glimpse of Rushdie. The now-secluded author narrates and appears 
throughout. 
</P>
<P>
"The Riddle of Midnight" is dense and often difficult to follow. It was made in 
1987 for Britain's Channel Four. Viewers there, well-versed in British colonial 
history, undoubtedly had more background to draw on. 
</P>
<P>
The film does provide some insights into Rushdie and his place in the Muslim 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Born in India, Rushdie is the product of an affluent, urban Muslim family. 
</P>
<P>
"I come from the Indian bourgeoisie, one of the most confident, successful, 
doubt-free groups of wealth-creators on the planet," Rushdie explains in the 
film. "But I have my doubts these days about that doubtlessness. Does wealth 
really trickle down, let's say, from high rise to hovel?" 
</P>
<P>
After spending most of his adult life in England, however, Rushdie is seen 
returning in the 40th year of India's independence (and his birth). He finds "a 
throng not only of people but also of dreams, memories, fears, hopes, portends, 
fictions and Gods." This is Rushdie's personal rediscovery of his native India, 
a country of enormous political, cultural and religious complexity as well as 
ironies. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie's original work, "Midnight's Children," was fiction, populated by the 
children born in the hour of India's independence. "The Riddle of Midnight" 
finds the real-life counterparts to those characters -- a Parsee businessman, a 
Bombay "pavement dweller," a Hindu demagogue, farmers and, in the film's most 
moving moment, a Sikh woman whose family was murdered by government-sponsored 
terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
Divided into three sections, "The City," "The Country" and "The Gods," "The 
Riddle of Midnight" refers to the puzzle of Indian independence, which was born 
at midnight on Aug. 14 and 15 in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
On that day, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, the Hindu leader of 
India's movement for independence, said: "At the strike of the midnight hour, 
when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, 
which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new, 
when an age ends and when the soul of a nation finds utterance." 
</P>
<P>
What Rushdie finds on his return, however, is a cacophony of social discord, 
confusion and danger. 
</P>
<P>
In "The City" he finds "the systematic creation of a militant Hindu 
fundamentalist consciousness. That's something new in India." He finds 
bourgeois businessmen losing sight of their heritage as they continue to 
embrace Western styles and cultures. He finds families of pavement dwellers who 
live "in the uncaring shadow" of the skyscrapers their cheap labor has built 
but who, to the government of Bombay, are statistical "mirages" and, therefore, 
do not exist. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Country" Rushdie finds Marxism taking root. One woman, who has the 
local party to thank for her increase in wages, explains her stomach-first 
politics in plain and simple terms. "This is the only party that has benefited 
me. So how can I support any other party?" 
</P>
<P>
The riddle, Rushdie finally explains, is, "How can a nation that never 
previously existed become independent? What does it mean to call this crowd of 
separate, national histories, conflicting cultures and warring faiths a nation? 
Maybe it's just something we made up. A story. A dream. Then again, maybe such 
fictions can become facts." 
</P>
<P>
The reality of India and the price of independence, though, has been a harsh 
one for many of its people, who live marginal, hand-to-mouth lives. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what is going to happen to India," one man concludes. 
</P>
<P>
"Here is the heart of the riddle," Rushdie says: "What is a real Indian, and 
conversely, what is another one?" Answering his own question, he decides, "Born 
of India, born of Indian parents, it's the lack of definition that unites you."

'SOCIETY'S CHILD' REVISITED; 
</P>
<P>
FOR JANIS IAN, THE 3RD TIME AROUND MAY BE A CHARM AFTER DECADE OF STRUGGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Society's Child" is back. Janis Ian, whose controversial song about an 
interracial romance caused a near-firestorm in the politically charged climate 
of the mid-1960s, has returned to the performance stage. Eight years after the 
release of her last recording, Ian will appear tonight with her trio at the 
Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Now 38, the singer/songwriter has embarked on the third phase of what has been 
a roller-coaster career. She was 16 when "Society's Child" met with its 
startling success (inspired, in no small measure, by Leonard Bernstein's seal 
of approval during a 1967 CBS-TV special called "Inside the Pop Revolution"). 
But the sudden celebrity was dampened by her parents' divorce, the casual 
dispersal of much of her income and, perhaps most telling of all, no follow-up 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the 1970s that Ian hit stride again, with a more mature, 
better-crafted musical outlook. "Jessie" (a chart-buster for Roberta Flack) was 
on the 1974 album "Stars." "Between the Lines," with its anthem to teen-age 
angst "At Seventeen," followed in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
But then -- despite continued activity that included an overseas disco hit, 
"Fly Too High," and a Grammy nomination for a duet on "Silly Habits" with Mel 
Torme -- Ian's visibility dried up again, and she entered a period of personal 
and financial malaise. Late last year, she moved to Nashville, concluding, she 
hopes, what has been a very difficult decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Brutal would be a better word to describe it," she said in a phone 
conversation earlier this week. Her 1978 marriage to Portuguese writer-producer 
Tino Sargo has fallen apart. "It lasted for either 6 1/2 years or eight years," 
Ian said, "depending upon which of us you talk to." There was a long, 
drawn-out, messy divorce in which she was sued for support. "He was not at all 
pleased with his loss of status." 
</P>
<P>
To compound the problem, Ian added, there was an ex-business associate who 
apparently failed to respond to IRS notices for eight years. "So, in the middle 
of the divorce, I just got totally wiped out financially. I'm still in a bad 
position with the IRS. I was actually on their felons' list because they 
couldn't get a response for eight years. Fortunately, they didn't throw me in 
jail, so I guess it could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, I found out that somebody had been stealing from me, but the statute of 
limitations had passed. The final blow came in '86 when I wound up in a 
hospital with a burst intestine just before I was scheduled to do the Philly 
Folk Festival. When they took me to the hospital, I wanted to wait until the 
next day for surgery. 'Let me at least call my parents,' I said. But they told 
me I had 45 minutes before I was dead. Fortunately, it happened so fast that I 
didn't have much time to get scared. 
</P>
<P>
"So I consider the 1980s a kind of a wrapping-up for me. Which makes this tour 
feel a whole lot like starting over, with both the plus and the minus of having 
some hits behind me." 
</P>
<P>
Ian began the tour with a knapsack full of new songs but no new recording, a 
risky move in an industry that prefers to have performers release an album 
first and tour afterwards. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, it's risky, all right," she laughed. "The concept of going out with a show 
that is 60 or 70% new material is the kind of temptation you feel when you're 
on the edge of a cliff and you think, 'God, I could jump, and maybe I could 
fly.' 
</P>
<P>
"The standard managerial thinking for somebody in my position right now would 
be to stay low, don't risk a tour, get a record contract, make an album, hope 
there's a hit, tour behind the album and the record company will support the 
tour -- as opposed to the kind of slogging we've been doing with no tour 
support. 
</P>
<P>
"But I basically found myself in the strange position of having no management 
and therefore being able to do anything I wanted. And I wanted to tour with 
these songs. I guess it's the first time since I was 14 that every decision is 
mine. And there's this weird thing that happens when you really have total 
control, which is that you don't need the control anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that we've been astoundingly lucky. We've gotten an amazing amount 
of good press; we've filled almost every hall and gone into second shows 
everywhere. The only thing I can put it down to is timing. It just feels like 
the right time, for me, and for the songs." 
</P>
<P>
Ian was enthusiastic about both the craft and the subject matter of her new 
songs. "They're real tight," she said. "I feel they're closer toward what I was 
moving toward with my first album, with 'Society's Child' and with 'Stars.' 
They're closer to that material than to anything I've done since. 
</P>
<P>
"And they're real sociological. After writing songs for other people for the 
last three years, I decided around the end of last year that it was time -- I'd 
learned enough, I wanted to do my own songs myself. I knew that I might just 
get one more shot at making an album. And if that was it, if I could only do 
one, if I was going to go down, well, I was going to go down in flames. 
</P>
<P>
"So the songs are uncompromising in their subject matter, but they're 
structured to be accessible, to make their point the first time you hear them. 
Concentration camps, incest -- you know, the light stuff -- but they've been 
tempered by some jazz and some fun stuff." 
</P>
<P>
One of her most unusual new pieces is called "Uncle Wonderful," a song that 
deals with incest as intently and directly as "Society's Child' dealt with 
interracial romance. "It's a tough song to do," she said. "Audiences either 
give you a standing ovation or they don't clap at all. But I think it's a good 
song, and I'll keep on doing it." 
</P>
<P>
At the moment, she said, four major record companies are bidding for her new 
material. "It's weird to see doors opening to me that were closed for so long. 
And it's the first time in my career that people are actually bidding. In the 
past, it was always having to go through the back door. With 'Society's Child,' 
we got turned down by everybody. And with 'Stars,' we had to go to an 
Australian production company and then sell it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real new to me to have people excited by the songs before there's a 
record. And it's also new to me to have a career based on things that are going 
right. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you reach a reckoning age," she concluded, "where you look around and 
you say, 'OK, I would have liked to do this, I would have liked to do that.' I 
don't have Melissa Etheridge's chops as a vocalist; I don't have Chick Corea's 
piano chops, and the truth is, I never will. 
</P>
<P>
"But that's OK. I have chops at other things. And you make a peace with that. 
You do what you do, and you do it as well as you can, and that's all you can 
ask. That's all anyone can ask." 
</P>

OASIS OF HOPE; 
</P>
<P>
FOR THE FRAGILE YOUNG, A CENTER IS RISING TO GIVE RELIEF TO PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

County Life.

<P>
Tethered to an oxygen unit, 23-month-old Elizabeth Wrensch toddles about the 
living room, tripping over the unit's cord, bumping into furniture. Nearby, her 
brother, Robert, 7 months, drinks happily from a bottle while snuggled in his 
mother's arms. 
</P>
<P>
A shrine-like collection of baby pictures decorates a wall in Jim and Candy 
Wrensch's Santa Ana living room -- birth certificates and other mementoes of 
their 23 months of fear, anxiety and hope since their children were born 
severely premature. Each weighed under two pounds. Elizabeth Ann survived 24 
operations by the time she celebrated her first birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Now, their son and daughter are doing so well that Candy and Jim call them the 
miracle kids. Their car license plate frame proclaims: Miracle Baby. 
</P>
<P>
But some misery has come with the miracles. The couple have had to turn their 
home into a makeshift hospital ward and learn how to become nurses. They rarely 
leave the house, never leave the kids and often are awakened at night by their 
children's sleep monitors. 
</P>
<P>
Just about the time she felt like giving up, Candy noticed a sign posted in 
front of a building under construction on her street: "Future home of the 
Center for Fragile Children." She called her doctor and said, "My kids better 
be No. 1 on the list." 
</P>
<P>
Kangaroo Kids, the Center for Fragile Children, is due to open early in August 
to help children like Elizabeth and Robert. Its founders believe it's the first 
of its kind in the county -- and among the first in the nation -- to provide 
comprehensive care to children with multiple, ongoing medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
The for-profit center, on Bush Street in Santa Ana, will provide monitoring and 
nursing services to youngsters who have been released from the hospital but who 
are too sick or weak to go home without nursing help. Premature infants and 
children up to age 3 whose doctors feel they need ongoing medical care will be 
accepted. 
</P>
<P>
The center, to be open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. weekdays and some weekend hours, 
is designed to accommodate 40 children. On the waiting list are those with 
seizure disorders, heart, lung and neuromuscular diseases, and cancer and 
post-operative patients, although the majority of the kids are premature 
infants with respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
About 60% of the staff will be registered nurses with neonatal experience and 
40% licensed vocational nurses. 
</P>
<P>
Ten physicians, including renowned pediatrician T. Berry Brazelton of Boston, 
serve on the center's national advisory board. Another 10 specialists serve on 
the facility's professional services committee and will periodically review 
cases and sit in on quarterly meetings at the center. 
</P>
<P>
Because the center is not strictly a day-care center nor a medical facility, it 
doesn't require state licensing and doesn't fall under the jurisdiction of the 
state Department of Health Services, which licenses medical facilities, or the 
state Department of Social Services, which licenses day-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a brand new area, and it doesn't fall under any jurisdiction," 
says Mary Kaarma,a supervisor in the Department of Social Services community 
care licensing division. 
</P>
<P>
The center will "definitely be licensed," Healey said, when an agency that has 
the proper credentials to oversee it is chosen. 
</P>
<P>
Candy Wrensch believes the center is exactly what her family needs "because you 
have to have about five arms" to keep up with her son and daughter. "You can't 
hold him and chase her. I'd been trying to get used to the fact that there was 
no help coming when I heard about Kangaroo Kids." 
</P>
<P>
For almost two years, a group of doctors and other pediatric specialists have 
been planning the center, which is owned by Care Visions Corp. in Anaheim. 
Spearheading the project are Tim Healey, a child development specialist, and 
Molly Chapman, a pediatric nurse practitioner. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman and Healey believe that parents need and want a homey place for their 
sick children that -- at about $20 an hour -- would serve as a more 
cost-effective and nurturing alternative to hospitalization and home nursing 
care. 
</P>
<P>
"We work with fragile kids, and we found the most difficult aspect was 
discharging them after their prolonged stay in the hospital," says Healey, who 
has a master's degree in physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
Too many parents were reporting stress and exhaustion in coping with the 
children's needs and too many children were being readmitted for medical 
problems because they weren't getting enough professional help, he says. 
"Parents were frustrated at having to play the nurse role, and the kids needed 
special developmental help that they were not getting in the home." After 
nearly two years of their children being hospitalized, the Wrensches face at 
least several more months of dependency on medical equipment and nursing. Their 
problems have been multiplied by a double dose of preemies. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Ann was born 16 weeks early, weighing 1 pound, 7 ounces. When she was 
4 months old, doctors propped her up in a baby-doll seat inside her hospital 
incubator. When she was released from Childrens Hospital of Orange County 9 1/2 
months after birth, she went home to round-the-clock nursing care and a mother 
trained to care for her by CHOC nurses. Today she is still fed through a 
stomach tube and tied to a portable oxygen unit. 
</P>
<P>
After Elizabeth's release, her parents gradually adjusted to her special care. 
But soon Candy Wrensch, now 42, found she was pregnant again. Twenty-six weeks 
after Elizabeth came home, Robert James was born, 14 weeks early, on Nov. 10, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
In those early months, the children struggled with lung disease, breathing 
disorders, eye and ear problems and bilateral hernias. Elizabeth underwent so 
many surgical procedures that "she looked like a spaghetti factory, she'd been 
cut up so much," says Candy Wrensch, whose doctors are not sure why she hasn't 
been able to carry a baby to full term. 
</P>
<P>
Even now, Elizabeth doesn't know how to suck, swallow and breathe at the same 
time and continues to take food through a gastrostomy tube. Both children sleep 
with monitors because they sometimes stop breathing while they sleep. 
</P>
<P>
When Robert came home from the hospital, the family had two 24-hour nurses for 
the children, paid by their insurance. Gradually home care was decreased, and a 
few weeks ago dwindling insurance benefits cut it back to six hours a month. 
The Wrensches have been told that their nursing benefits will be extended for 
the center because it will cost less than home care. 
</P>
<P>
"It was devastating," says Candy Wrensch, referring to the cutback. "I didn't 
know what I was going to do, really. My husband had another job and had to quit 
it and start his own (welding) business to be here to help." 
</P>
<P>
"There were many times that we didn't think we'd get to this point," Jim 
Wrensch says. 
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, children born as small as Elizabeth had little chance of 
survival, says Allen Iseri, a pediatrician with Doctors of Children of Orange 
County medical group. "Nowadays, with our technology, the rates of survival go 
up every day. We are seeing children surviving but with long-term medical 
problems. Kangaroo Kids fits a need in the community that before hasn't been 
met." 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Rucker, director of CHOC's pediatric pulmonary service and a member of 
the Kangaroo Kids advisory board, believes the center will offer "a major 
improvement in the health care of fragile children. It will also allow the 
parents to be free of that kind of responsibility for a period and rejuvenate 
their dedication to their kids and allow them to relax and enjoy each other. 
You know, marriage under this kind of stress can run into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
For parents who can't afford the fees or whose insurance won't pay, the center 
may turn out to be more a temptation than reality. 
</P>
<P>
Gretchen Cassidy of Irvine says she has been waiting months for the kind of 
nursing care that Kangaroo Kids will provide. Her son Michael, 2 1/2, was born 
12 weeks early and suffers from lung disease. He needs oxygen 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
Her hopes were dashed when her insurance company refused to pay for any 
additional nursing care, either at home or the center. The center "was too new 
an idea," says Cassidy, a single mother and real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Gasser, president of Care Visions, says Cassidy is in the minority. 
</P>
<P>
"Typically, the insurance policies will pick up all of these charges," he says, 
referring to the day-care costs. "Of course, every policy is different, but the 
center is an alternative that costs a lot less than services most insurance 
policies are already paying." 
</P>
<P>
At $19 to $21 an hour, Gasser says, Kangaroo Kids will cost about 40% less than 
home nursing and about 60% less than hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne Sorenson, a case manager at Blue Shield of California, says her company 
is excited about the concept of Kangaroo Kids. "This is the type of alternative 
care we are looking for. It will be less expensive . . . than home nursing and 
hospitalization. It will also allow a parent to go back to work or a parent to 
get some sleep." 
</P>
<P>
Chapman says the center's criteria in accepting children are that they need 
nursing care but are stable enough to go three to four weeks without requiring 
hospital treatment. Approval by the child's physician will also be required. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman and Healey are trying to create a fund-raising group to help pay for 
the care of children not covered by insurance. They also hope to persuade state 
officials that Medi-Cal should pay for the services when private policies 
won't. 
</P>
<P>
Sprinkled among the breathing monitors and oxygen units at Kangaroo Kids will 
be teddy bears, climbing toys and cribs with water-bed-type mattresses, 
specially designed to calm colicky babies. The building will house an office 
for a parents' support group and a parent resource library. The rooms, in 
soothing soft colors and low lights, will be patterned after day-care centers 
for healthy kids rather than hospital wards. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to take all the high technology available and put it in a home 
setting," Healey says. "The aim is to normalize the child's environment as soon 
as possible, and we want the parents to participate, but as parents, not as 
nurses." 
</P>
<P>
One parent hoping to ease her own nursing burden is Janet Stone. Her daughter, 
Erin, born 6 months ago with congenital heart disease, is fed through a stomach 
tube. The baby is highly susceptible to infections and often vomits during 
feedings. 
</P>
<P>
Stone believes that enrolling Erin at the center would help her entire family. 
They try to have as much of a normal routine as possible, but because Erin must 
be fed every four hours, they really can't go out for any length of time. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge is finding skilled and affordable help for Erin, Stone says. "The 
only way I feel comfortable leaving her is with someone with the medical 
background that she needs. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, having a baby was so long in coming," she says. Then having a child 
with severe medical problems was devastating. "But it is encouraging to know 
that there is help."

<P>
AND IF YOU'RE REALLY OUT TO IMPRESS . . . 
</P>
<P>
Consider the Penthouse Suite at San Francisco's Fairmont Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
After the limousine picks you up at the airport and delivers you to the 
Fairmont, take your private elevator to this eight-room suite. If you want to 
blast around town for a while, store your excess cash in the suite's 
burglar-proof vault and make your way downstairs. The limousine's at your 
disposal. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to hang around, though, you won't lack for diversions. There are 
four television sets. If you're feeling more civilized, though, pour a brandy 
from the fully stocked bar, grab a snack from the tray of complimentary 
California-grown fruits and slip into the two-story circular library with domed 
ceiling. Or maybe a tour of your digs, with its original art by contemporary 
American artists, would be more enjoyable. Considering you have more than 6,300 
square feet to roam around in, it'll take a minute or two. 
</P>
<P>
Too contemplative, you say? Nip into the game room, with its Persian-tiled 
walls and stained-glass skylight, or knock out a few tunes on the grand piano 
in the drawing room. 
</P>
<P>
But you don't want to lavish all this just on yourself, do you? If you bring 
along 20 of your closest friends, you can all partake of several wines and an 
elaborate dinner prepared by the hotel's French or Chinese chefs. 
</P>
<P>
Seems like a crowd? Not to worry. The dining room accommodates up to 50. And if 
some of your crowd need to improve their table manners, exile them to the full 
eat-in kitchen. It's not a hardship sentence, though, for they too can use the 
special silver and china. 
</P>
<P>
After dinner, they won't even have to leave the city. There are overnight 
accommodations for 14 in the adjoining Fairmont Tower. Six of them will have to 
make due in your suite's second and third bedrooms, each with two double beds 
and private bath. 
</P>
<P>
Once the gang's dispatched, take a seat in front of one of the four 
wood-burning fireplaces, inlaid with lapis lazuli and marble, and enjoy the 
feeling. This is, after all, a spot usually home to royalty, diplomats, 
celebrities and top corporate executives. In fact, Secretary of State Edward 
Stettinius used the place as his headquarters when he was helping draft the 
United Nations charter in 1945. And don't forget to take in the killer view of 
the city lights from your private outdoor terrace. 
</P>
<P>
And so, finally, to bed. In your case, to the master bedroom with its king-size 
bed. The pillows are 100% down, with goose feathers imported exclusively from 
Ireland. Sample the bedside tray of petit fours. And if there's a problem, ring 
the butler or maid; they're available round the clock. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning, after breakfast in bed for you and your guests, all of them, 
bomb down to the health club for a workout. When you get back, step into your 
private bath with separate shower and marble tub with 24-karat gold-plated 
fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, your limousine back to the airport will be ready to leave, even 
if you're not. 
</P>
<P>
Oh yes, the bill. For your one night, $20,000.

SINGLE LIFE: MORMONS' DATES SET A 'DIFFERENT' STANDARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN CHRISTIAN, Susan Christian is a regular contributor to Orange County 
Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The movie was rated "PG," so he thought it a safe choice for his night on the 
town. Initial impressions can be deceiving, however. Midway through the film, 
that modern Hollywood requisite -- The Bedroom Scene -- staged a surprise 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
So Scott Boyenger, 19, walked out of the theater. 
</P>
<P>
"My date was all, 'You're so weird,' " recalled the Huntington Beach resident, 
employing typical teen-age vernacular. 
</P>
<P>
Usually Boyenger dates only young women who, like himself, are Mormons -- 
members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Otherwise, his 
social life might become a series of disastrous outings like the one he cited. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel more comfortable dating Mormons because I know that they have the same 
standards I have," agreed Melissa Pinkston, also 19. "Generally speaking, I 
know that they're not going to try anything." 
</P>
<P>
Her remark elicited a unified guffaw from her group of friends, all present to 
talk about the art of Mormon dating. 
</P>
<P>
Mormons are different from the world at large, and they're proud to admit it. 
Church rules dictate that they don't drink, smoke, curse, listen to racy songs, 
watch racy movies, or engage in premarital sex. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, their dating experience is different, as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Different," however, is not synonymous with "difficult." In fact, meeting 
prospective mates may be much easier for Mormons than for the general 
population; a major function of the church is the care and fostering of 
relationships. Mormons even organize wards -- roughly, the Protestant/Catholic 
equivalent of congregations -- specifically for the unattached. 
</P>
<P>
Of about 100 wards in Orange County, serving 47,000 local Mormons, six are 
designated for "young single adults." Bishop Gary Nelson oversees one such 
ward, based in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the goals is marriage and family within the church, and this is a good 
way for Mormons to meet one another," Nelson said. "We've had over 100 
marriages (among members of his ward) in the 3 1/2 years that I've been 
bishop." 
</P>
<P>
The singles' wards sponsor dances almost every weekend. Occasionally, two or 
three wards will combine forces for a social event so that young Mormons 
throughout Orange County can interact. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday afternoons, Nelson leads his 300-member congregation in discussions 
about courtship and marriage. "They find strength from one another in trying to 
live in a world that doesn't practice their same standards," he said. "We teach 
the law of chastity -- total abstinence before marriage -- which sets us 
apart." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson often counsels unmarried couples about sexual attraction. "We hope 
they'll seek us out before it becomes a problem," he said. "One of my main 
responsibilities as bishop is to help young people avoid (premarital sex)." 
</P>
<P>
While the church allows dating -- and even marriage -- with non-members, it 
encourages otherwise, Nelson said: "As a safety valve, we recommend to kids 
that serious dating take place within the membership. It's not that we think 
we're better than the rest of the world; it's just that it's easier for kids to 
find support among their Mormon peers." 
</P>
<P>
"When you date a Mormon, you date someone who has the same principles as you," 
Boyenger said. 
</P>
<P>
Not only do they prefer dating within their religion, Boyenger and his buddies 
said that they would rather hang out with fellow Mormons in most all social 
settings. "I don't feel comfortable going to non-Mormon parties because I end 
up being the only person who's sober," said Michelle Molinari, 20, of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Ted Moore, 22, of Huntington Beach, enjoyed dating 
non-Mormon girls in high school. "It's fun meeting people who think differently 
from yourself," he said. "A lot of girls would make the comment, 'I feel safe 
around you,' which was a compliment to me." 
</P>
<P>
Wholesome, "safe" Mormons indeed can make appealing dates for outsiders, the 
friends said. "I once had a (non-Mormon) guy ask me to a New Year's Eve dance 
because his grandparents were going to be there, and he wanted to take someone 
they'd approve of," said Denise Newburg, 19, of Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the group said that they have dated non-members, all plan to 
marry Mormons. One of the dangers in dating outside their church, they added, 
is the possibility of falling in love with someone who does not share their 
beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Moore admitted that he and a non-Mormon developed crushes on one another in 
high school. "Her parents didn't want her to join the church and made us stop 
dating," he said. "I was bummed out." 
</P>
<P>
Statistically, Mormons marry young -- before the age of 25. "Most people (in 
the general population) don't get married until they've gone to college and 
started their careers. Our church says, no, those things shouldn't get in the 
way of marriage; you can be married and go to school at the same time," said 
Molinari, who plans to marry her fiance, Brian Peterson, 21, this October. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike many modern singles, Mormons do not stall their relationships in a 
lengthy holding pattern before tying the knot. "We don't grab the first person 
we see, but then again, when we find someone we're compatible with, we don't 
date them for five years," Molinari explained. "The mystique would wear off, 
and you'd never get around to marrying them. And you'd end up an old maid." 
</P>
<P>
"(Church counselors) say that within three or four months, you should know if a 
person is right for you," Boyenger said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Molinari interjected with humorous candor, "it would be difficult to 
date someone for two years and stay celibate." 
</P>
<P>
so we might as well do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
The church advises group dating, to reduce the risk of overly romantic 
interludes. "It's recommended that there not be a lot of kissing because that 
might lead to something else," Boyenger said. 
</P>
<P>
But, Pinkston quickly clarified, "They don't say not to kiss, either. If you're 
going to do anything, make it kissing." 
</P>
<P>
An advantage of saving sexual intimacy for marriage is that partners start with 
a clean slate, devoid of pre-learned expectations, said Pinkston. "You can't 
compare because you don't have anything to compare it to." 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, premarital relationships are founded on more than physical 
affection, she said: "You can sit down and talk to each other." 
</P>
<P>
"You better like talking to each other because after a while (sex) probably 
gets old, anyway, and you're back to talking," Moore said, winning a round of 
laughter. 
</P>
<P>
Because the church teaches members to sidestep temptation by shirking 
un-Mormon-like influences -- Hollywood bedroom scenes, for example -- finding 
an acceptable movie for a date can be tricky. The group endorsed "Field of 
Dreams" and "Tucker" as examples of good, clean entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"You know how many swear words were in 'Top Gun'? I counted: 77," Pinkston 
said. "That's not necessary; that's not the sort of thing I want to put in my 
head." 
</P>
<P>
Mormons, Newburg concluded, have to be "creative" when it comes to dating. "We 
don't go to bars; we don't drink; we don't go to R-rated movies. We make our 
own fun. We get together and play games. We have dances." 
</P>
<P>
Do Mormons like rock 'n' roll? "Of course," Newburg said. "We even have disc 
jockeys from (rock stations) KLOS and KROQ emcee our dances. Contrary to 
popular belief, we don't sing hymns while we're dancing."

A headline in Thursday's editions incorrectly said the Dalai Lama addressed 
"followers" at a meeting. In fact, most of those present were not followers of 
the Dalai Lama, but were Buddhists of many sects and national origins. The 
Dalai Lama has spiritual authority over Tibetan Buddhists but not over other 
Buddhists.

U.S. PERMANENTLY OUTLAWS IMPORTED ASSAULT WEAPONS; 
</P>
<P>
ATF BANS ALL BUT 7 GUN TYPES

<P>
The Bush Administration today slapped a permanent import ban on 43 types of 
assault-style firearms whose shipment into the country has been suspended since 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
Stephen E. Higgins, director of the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms, said the government had studied 50 styles of 
semiautomatic weapons imported into the country and had decided to ban all but 
seven of them permanently. 
</P>
<P>
The ATF has been studying the use of the suspended weapons to determine if they 
fit the requirement that they be used for sporting purposes. 
</P>
<P>
The Gun Control Act of 1968 bans the importation of weapons that are not used 
for legitimate sporting purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"The study was undertaken because of the dramatic increase in the number of 
these weapons being imported and police reports of their use in violent crime," 
Higgins said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the study, 43 of the weapons were classified officially as 
semiautomatic assault rifles and as such were barred from further importation. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins said in April that the weapons under study were "basically paramilitary 
in appearance" and had large-capacity magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Of the seven models exempted from the import ban, six are .22-caliber rimfire 
rifles and the other a gun called the Valmet Hunter, which had been considered 
an AK-47 type of weapon during the suspension. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flood of Guns Expected 
</P>
<P>
The ATF said recently that importers were preparing to flood the country with 
nearly a million weapons if the suspension were lifted. The suspension covered 
new import permits as well as those weapons for which permits already had been 
granted and which were en route to this country. 
</P>
<P>
The bureau, which has the power to control imports, does not regulate domestic 
manufacture of weapons, so similar weapons made in the United States would not 
be affected by the action. Several bills pending in Congress would control or 
eliminate many of the U.S.-made assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The ATF has estimated that domestic models account for 75% of the 3 million 
semiautomatic rifles now owned by Americans. Colt Industries suspended sales of 
its AR-15 in March. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, a lifetime member of the National Rifle Assn., which opposes 
limits on weapons, came into office opposing any bans on the assault weapons. A 
public outcry over the availability of the weapons was triggered in January 
when a man opened fire with an AK-47 and other weapons on a schoolyard in 
Stockton, Calif., killing five children. The man, Patrick Purdy, later killed 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Brady, chairwoman of Handgun Control Inc., praised the ATF's action, 
saying it "confirms what was long known: that these imported assault weapons do 
not serve a legitimate sporting purpose." 
</P>
<P>
John M. Snyder, spokesman for the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and 
Bear Arms, denounced the action. "I think that it shows the undependability of 
government, because originally, the ATF had certified that these rifles could 
be imported because they are suitable for sporting purposes," Snyder said.

3RD MOON FOUND ORBITING NEPTUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

A new moon of Neptune, about one-fifth the size of Earth's moon, has been 
discovered in photographs taken by the Voyager 2 space probe, Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory researchers said today. Only two moons, Nereid and Triton, were 
previously known. 
</P>
<P>
The new moon, temporarily designated 1989 N1, is as large as 400 miles in 
diameter and orbits Neptune's equator at an altitude of about 57,000 miles. It 
was discovered by JPL astronomer Stephen P. Synnott as a "small, bright smudge" 
on photographs of the giant blue-green planet. The photographs were taken from 
57 million miles away as the probe raced toward its Aug. 24 rendezvous with 
Neptune and Triton. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequent photographs showed the moon in different positions corresponding to 
the predicted orbit, confirming that the object is a moon. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier photographs from Voyager had revealed the existence of a large "dark 
spot" on Neptune similar to the giant red spot on Jupiter and believed to be 
caused by weather conditions. The photographs have also revealed dark bands 
near the poles similar to those seen on other gaseous planets. 
</P>
<P>
The new moon, which is too faint to appear in printed photographs, is the first 
of as many as 10 that researchers expect to find circling Neptune.

Gene Gotti, brother of Gambino mob boss John Gotti, was sentenced today to 50 
years in prison for running a multimillion-dollar drug ring. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge John R. Bartels ignored defense lawyers' appeals for mercy 
in handing down the maximum sentence. "I have my obligations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Co-defendant John Carneglia was also given 50 years and both were fined $75,000 
each. Gotti, 42, and Carneglia, 44, were found guilty May 23 of being at the 
center of a major heroin trafficking ring. Authorities describe Gotti as a capo 
or captain in the Gambino crime family and Carneglia as a soldier in the 
organization.

BUSH SEEKS PAY RAISE FOR 7,200

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush today asked Congress to give 7,200 federal executives pay 
increases of 8% to 25%, with even higher raises going to a selected 200 with 
special skills. 
</P>
<P>
However, the President coupled his pay raise plan with a proposal that the 
officials justify their right to the higher salaries every three years to keep 
receiving them. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's proposal would give 25% hikes to just the most senior officials, 
matching a salary hike he has already advocated for federal judges. More junior 
officials would get smaller increases under the plan. 
</P>
<P>
The plan would raise the pay of top federal officials, including Cabinet 
members, to $124,400 from the present $99,500. 
</P>
<P>
It would also raise the salary of Vice President Dan Quayle from $115,000 to 
$143,000. But it would not affect Bush's $200,000 salary. 
</P>
<P>
The total pay package would cost taxpayers $101 million in the fiscal year that 
begins Oct. 1 and $147 million in the following fiscal year, Fitzwater said.

Japan's Emperor Hirohito, who died last month at 87, left assets worth $13.36 
million, according to the first public accounting of imperial family private 
property, the Imperial Household Agency said today. 
</P>
<P>
Emperor Akihito and Empress dowager Nagako equally divided the estate except 
for about 3,000 works of art that were donated to the state. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said the decision was based on consultation among Hirohito's 11 
closest relatives, indicating that nine had given up any claim on the estate. 
</P>
<P>
The royal family's real estate, including about 5,436 acres of land, are exempt 
from taxation because they are considered state land under the postwar 
constitution.

Reported cases of AIDS around the world rose in June by 10,181 or 6.5%, to a 
total 167,373 as of July 1, the World Health Organization said today. 
</P>
<P>
WHO said the relatively large increase was due to updated reports from African 
and Latin American nations as well as the United States and several West 
European countries. 
</P>
<P>
With 95,561 cases, the United States accounted for 57% of the latest global 
total, cumulative since WHO began keeping AIDS statistics in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
As of July 1, the U.N. health agency said, 149 countries had reported one or 
more cases, with Fiji having its first case during June. 
</P>
<P>
Experts said the real global total is probably two to three times higher 
because African and many other Third World countries lack detection facilities 
and are many months late in sending reports.

Ford Motor Co. will build a $120-million plant in Portugal to make automobile 
radios, compact disc players and other audio components, the company said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
An agreement to build the 230,000-square-foot plant was signed by Oscar B. Marx 
III, executive director of Ford's Automotive Components Group, and Joaquim 
Ferreira do Amaral, Portugal's minister of commerce and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
The plant, about 40 miles from Lisbon on the Setubal peninsula, will begin 
operations in 1992 and employ about 1,700 people. Its products will be used 
mostly in Ford assembly plants in Europe, said spokeswoman Maureen Mazzatenta.

AGENTS SCOUR WHITE HOUSE GUARD'S HOME;

The Secret Service searched the home of one of its White House guards Thursday 
night after he acknowledged he escorted a Washington businessman and his 
associates on late-night tours of the executive mansion. 
</P>
<P>
Secret Service spokesman Rich Adams today confirmed that the service, which 
protects President Bush and other high-ranking officials, searched the home of 
Reginald A. deGueldre, a uniformed White House guard. Adams declined to provide 
details of the search. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been no arrest, so we can't release any information involving our 
investigation until that time," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times reported that deGueldre led businessman Craig J. Spence 
and his friends on at least one late-night White House tour. The newspaper also 
has linked Spence to a police investigation of a male prostitution ring 
operating in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post, in today's editions, said five agents searched deGueldre's 
Oakton home and took dozens of photographs. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the newspaper, deGueldre said he had been asked by his 
superiors and the U.S. Attorney's Office whether he had received gifts from or 
did private security work for Spence. 
</P>
<P>
He said he told officials that he received no gratuities from Spence and 
performed no favors other than arranging and conducting late-night tours of the 
White House during the Ronald Reagan Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"Spence was just a friend of mine," he told the Post. "I took him and his 
friends on the tours. He never gave me anything. I never worked for him." 
</P>
<P>
The officer also confirmed that he was asked if he had any knowledge of the 
prostitution ring.

In an effort to boost the sale of Texas natural gas, Railroad Commissioner John 
Sharp said today he will co-host a gas conference in Los Angeles next week 
along with California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal will be to encourage California utilities and consumers to purchase 
clean-burning Texas natural gas to meet their rapidly increasing energy 
demands," Sharp said. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp said the Los Angeles natural gas conference, Wednesday through Friday, 
and two earlier conferences in Boston and Houston are designed to increase the 
sale of Texas gas, which is known to be more economical and better for the 
environment than oil or coal.

<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market jumped ahead today, posting its fourth straight gain amid 
increasing hopes for further declines in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 25.42 points to 2,487.86, 
stretching its gain for the week to 47.80 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 166.43 million shares, up from 140.45 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 1.74 to 181.56. 
</P>
<P>
The market opened on a hesitant note, but then picked up steam at midsession as 
traders concluded that the Federal Reserve apparently had been encouraged to 
relax its credit policy by the Labor Department's employment data for June. 
</P>
<P>
The report showed an increase of 180,000 in nonfarm payroll employment, below 
most advance estimates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bond Prices Rise 
</P>
<P>
The figures for May were revised to show a gain of 207,000, more than double 
the 101,000 originally reported a month ago. Still, brokers said, Wall 
Streeters came increasingly to believe that the Fed interpreted the data as 
reason enough to ease up on its credit restraints. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were higher in early trading today, nudged upward by the new 
unemployment statistics that indicated the economy is slowing. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was up about 5/16 point, or $3.12 
for every $1,000 in face value, at around midday. Its yield, which moves 
inversely to price, had declined to 8.06% from 8.09% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Signs of slowing economic growth ease fears of inflation, an enemy of the bond 
market. They also increase the chances that the Federal Reserve could loosen 
monetary policy and push interest rates lower. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of short-term 
government issues had risen 3/16 point to 9/32 point, intermediate maturities 
had gained 1/4 point to 5/16 point, and 20-year issues had jumped 11/16 point, 
according to Telerate Inc., a financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
In corporate trading, industrials slipped. Moody's investment grade corporate 
bond index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds 
with maturities of five years or longer, edged down 0.02 to 327.77. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.93% as the discount dropped 11 
basis points to 7.68%. Yields on six-month bills declined to 7.85% as the 
discount tumbled 8 basis points to 7.46%. Yields on 1-year bills fell to 7.82% 
as the discount slid 11 basis points to 7.30%. 
</P>
<P>
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the 
annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the 
percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 
quoted at 9 1/4%, down from 9 5/16% late Thursday.

FDA BANS ALL OTC BALDNESS CURES AS USELESS

The Food and Drug Administration said today it is banning the sale of 
non-prescription creams and lotions whose manufacturers claim they grow hair or 
prevent baldness, because none has proven effective. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA said in today's Federal Register that no manufacturer has been able to 
show that such a product works. 
</P>
<P>
The ban applies to products available without a prescription that are used 
externally. These products are usually sold by mail or through barbers or 
beauticians. 
</P>
<P>
The ban will become effective in six months, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA also said there is no evidence that vitamins, food supplements or other 
products taken orally retard baldness or grow hair. The agency said it will 
remove these products from the market on a case-by-case basis if their 
distributors continue to make such claims. 
</P>
<P>
The only product approved by the FDA for stimulating hair growth on the crown 
of the head is a prescription drug that is a 2% solution of minoxidil, which is 
applied externally. The drug is manufactured by the Upjohn Co. and sold under 
the name Rogaine. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA's ban is based on a recommendation of an advisory panel that evaluated 
a number of ingredients, including lanolin, olive oil, wheat germ oil and 
vitamins. The panel found none of these prevent baldness or promote hair 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA said that once the ban is in effect, manufacturers of any 
non-prescription drug claiming to prevent baldness or grow hair will have to 
provide proof to the agency that it is safe and effective before it can be put 
on the market.

CHALLENGE BY MCENROE ENDS ON RAINY COURT IN 3-SET VICTORY BY EDBERG

<P>
John McEnroe's Wimbledon challenge ended on a rainy Centre Court today, shot 
down by the thundering serve and volley of defending champion Stefan Edberg. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old American, a three-time Wimbledon winner playing his first Grand 
Slam semifinal in almost four years, was always a step behind as the 
second-seeded Swede muscled to a 7-5, 7-6, 7-6 victory. 
</P>
<P>
McEnroe showed no ill effects from the shoulder-muscle tear that forced him out 
of the men's doubles Thursday and -- aside from a brief complaint about wet 
turf in the very first game -- kept his temper in check. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outplayed McEnroe 
</P>
<P>
Edberg just outplayed him and won in the third-set tiebreaker with a 
lightning-quick backhand return of a mighty McEnroe second serve. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, I did the best I could. It just wasn't good enough," McEnroe said. 
"The key thing was his volleying. He volleyed fabulous 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed. I felt like I could have won this tournament. Things just 
didn't work out." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg said there was no one area where he had the edge. 
</P>
<P>
"There were small things to make me win," Edberg said. "I hit some good shots 
when I really had to. There was not a lot of difference between us." 
</P>
<P>
The match was interrupted for almost 3 1/2 hours by rain early in the third 
set, and that delay caused officials to postpone the second semifinal between 
Ivan Lendl and Boris Becker until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The women's crown will also be decided Saturday in a rematch of the 1988 title 
match, with defending champion Steffi Graf meeting eight-time winner Martina 
Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
The last time a semifinal was staged the same day as a final was in 1985, when 
Anders Jarryd and Becker finished a rain-interrupted semifinal before the 
women's championship. 
</P>
<P>
The last time McEnroe played in the final four of a Grand Slam was at the U.S. 
Open in 1985. The last time he reached the semis at Wimbledon was 1984, when he 
won his third championship. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeded Fifth 
</P>
<P>
A sabbatical from tennis, marriage and fatherhood have intervened, and while he 
was seeded fifth this year, no one forecast a late round for "Mac the Mouth." 
</P>
<P>
No one except McEnroe. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm one of the four or five people who can win this," McEnroe said before the 
103rd edition of the grass-court tournament began. 
</P>
<P>
He did his best to back up his boast, escaping a two-set deficit for the first 
time in his career to beat Darren Cahill in the first round, fending off 
challenges all through the early matches and finally beating fourth-seeded Mats 
Wilander of Sweden in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
One more Swede was too much. Although he had problems with his first serve, 
McEnroe played what may have been his best overall match of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
But Edberg had the answer for every drop shot, every change of pace, every 
inside-out forehand that McEnroe previously used to such advantage. 
</P>
<P>
That answer was power and quickness.

American Greg LeMond held on to the leader's yellow jersey in the Tour de 
France cycling race today after finishing in the pack behind solo winner Joel 
Pelier of France in the sixth stage. 
</P>
<P>
The 161-mile leg from Rennes to the modern city of Futuroscope was to be the 
longest of the 23-day, 3,250-kilometer event. Most of the race was conducted in 
the rain, as was Thursday's time trial. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the riders held back, and Pelier made a solo effort to win by 1 minute, 
34 seconds in 6:57:45. Eddy Schurer of the Netherlands broke away from the pack 
in the final kilometer to finish second. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Vandaerden of Belgium and Adrie Van der Poel of the Netherlands were third 
and fourth, respectively, with Rudy Dhaenens of Belgium fifth. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond, the first American to win the prestigious race in 1986 and who missed 
the last two years, hung on to the overall lead by finishing in the main group. 
He still has a five-second advantage over France's Laurent Fignon, the 1983-84 
winner, with France's Thierry Marie third, 20 seconds behind LeMond. 
</P>
<P>
Another long stage is scheduled Saturday with a 160.5-mile leg from Poitiers to 
Bordeaux.

<P>
Simmons said she learned that the term wool is a derivative of the term 
wooling, a reference to sexual intercourse and a derogatory reference to women. 
</P>
<P>
She had gone to the clubhouse to interview shortstop Cal Ripken Jr. Simmons 
said she left the room without interviewing Ripken but returned Monday and 
conducted the interview. 
</P>
<P>
Lucchino apologized and said the incident was a prank that got out of hand, the 
reporter said.

<P>
The Vancouver Canadians, citing what they said was a consistent policy of late 
salary payments by the parent Chicago White Sox, refused to play a scheduled 
Pacific Coast League game Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
The players left the Albuquerque Sports Stadium about 90 minutes before the 
scheduled 7 p.m., MDT, start of the game against Albuquerque and returned to 
their hotel, then went into a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"We have players with wives and babies back home, and if they don't have the 
rent and grocery money, they're in trouble," infielder Jeff Schaefer said. "We 
have obligations to meet just like everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
The players issued a handwritten statement, which said in part: "The reason for 
the walkout is delinquent salary payments out of Chicago. We have in the past 
tried to resolve this issue through complaints to management and the Major 
League Players organization." 
</P>
<P>
Brent Imlach, vice president and general manager of the Canadians, said in a 
telephone interview from Vancouver that the checks, due June 30, had been 
mailed but apparently had been delayed in getting to the team because of the 
July 4 holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that they were sent Friday," Imlach said. "The checks were 
sent out when they were supposed to be sent out" from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The players, however, said this episode is nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
"It has occurred for the past two seasons," Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
The players said they would meet again today but indicated they would play the 
final game in the series against Albuquerque if the checks arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The umpiring crew declared the game a 9-0 forfeit victory for Albuquerque.

<P>
A 53-year-old Los Alamitos man was arrested in connection with the shooting 
death of his son-in-law, who was found dead on his front lawn in Orange, police 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
James Rovida Jr., a self-employed truck driver, was being held in Orange County 
Jail today on suspicion of murder, Orange Police Detective Dave Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Rovida's son-in-law, Robert Brock, was found about 3 a.m. Thursday 
on the front lawn of a Quincy Avenue home that Brock shared with his sister, 
Hill said. Neighbors had heard gunshots and notified police, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
Hill said Brock had two gunshot wounds, possibly from a medium-caliber pistol. 
Police arrested Rovida hours later, partly on information from neighbors and 
from Brock's sister about a pickup truck whose driver fled the scene just after 
the shooting, Hill said.

NEWSMAKERS: JACKIE OWNS THE STAGE AS HER 'THIRD ACT' OPENS AT 60 
</P>

If all the world's a stage, then Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis enters the "third 
act" of her life this year an affluent and "confident" player with $200 million 
at her bidding, a longtime acquaintance writes in the August issue of Vanity 
Fair. Edward Klein interviewed 60 friends of the former First Lady, who turns 
60 on July 28, and paints her as a "woman who has managed to develop into an 
ever-more appealing, self-confident personality" -- who's also ever-so rich. 
Starting with $25 million from the estate of the late Aristotle Onassis, his 
widow has been able to increase her fortune to almost $200 million, not 
counting her $45,000 annual salary as an editor at Doubleday books, Klein says. 
One of her financial advisers has been Maurice Tempelsman, whom Klein describes 
as "Jackie's significant other." "He's made it possible for her to enter the 
third act of her life, the act in which life's conflicts are resolved," Klein 
says.

 -- An aide came to the aid of President Bush in his interview with CBS 
anchorman Dan Rather last year, using cue cards to feed Bush those seemingly 
spontaneous ripostes, a new book says. The most famous retort came when 
then-Vice President Bush told Rather, who had been questioning him on his role 
in the Iran-Contra affair, "How would you like it if I judged your career by 
those seven minutes when you walked off the set in New York?" -- referring to a 
1987 incident when a tennis match ran into the CBS anchorman's broadcast. What 
people at home could not see was that when Bush struggled for a response, media 
consultant Roger Ailes would write out something on a pad and hold it just 
beneath the TV camera in Bush's line of vision, say CBS correspondent Bob 
Schieffer and co-author Gary Paul Gates in their book "The Acting President."

 -- Lucille Ball was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, as 
President Bush described her and four other recipients as American heroes. Also 
receiving the nation's highest civilian award in a ceremony in the White House 
East Room were former Sen. Margaret Chase Smith, aviator and war hero James H. 
Doolittle and statesmen Douglas Dillon and George Kennan. Gary Morton, Ball's 
husband, accepted the medal for the comedian who died April 26 at age 77. ANN

POLLUTION FEARS IN MERGER EASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fears that a proposed merger by San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and Southern 
California Edison would generate more air pollution in the San Diego area are 
unfounded, an air-quality official told the San Diego City Council's Public 
Services and Safety committee. Richard Sommerville, executive director of the 
San Diego Air Pollution Control District, said the merger is not likely to 
cause the San Diego utility's plants to generate power at higher capacities. He 
also said it was guesswork to say that San Diego's air quality would improve to 
the detriment of air quality in the Los Angeles and Ventura County areas 
because of the merger. San Diego's rigorous air-quality standards will keep 
industry from moving to the city as companies attempt to cope with stiffer 
emission regulations in the Los Angeles area, he said, and regulatory agencies 
work to evaluate effects of the proposed merger.

FUROR OVER FLAG BURNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bethell's column was typical of a conservative's self-righteousness. 
</P>
<P>
By saying that the Supreme Court is "inviting backlash," Bethell's reasoning 
seems to imply that simply because some people will have their egos bruised or 
their feelings hurt from burning the flag that that is reason enough to outlaw 
such a form of expression. 
</P>
<P>
Then he insults the intelligence of those who may disagree with him by saying 
that the "problem" is that allowing flag burning "departs from common sense." 
Why? Because of all the people who might be upset by it? Awww! 
</P>
<P>
He concludes his dribble by stating -- presumptuously -- that burning the flag 
"is one that aims to inflict injury on those who hold the flag dear." 
</P>
<P>
On the same page Alan Dershowitz makes a more rational statement by saying that 
"in a free society, a government should not dictate the form of content of 
communications critical of its policies." 
</P>
<P>
Now, that's the America I've come to know and love!

In response to "What They Die for, We Burn," by Lee Iacocca, Op-Ed Page, June 
29: 
</P>
<P>
"The irony," said Iacocca, "is almost too heavy to comprehend": The Goddess of 
Democracy is destroyed in China, and in the U.S., the Supreme Court says 
Americans have the right to burn the flag. 
</P>
<P>
Through incredibly twisted logic, Iacocca sees the right of free expression in 
America as opposed to the right of free expression in China. 
</P>
<P>
What can be more ironic than Iacocca's own view?

Paging through the July 2nd edition of The Times, I count 17 advertisements 
containing either a U.S. flag, or some variation on Old Glory. 
</P>
<P>
Over the holiday weekend, commercial establishments from the corner gas station 
to Dodger Stadium were decked out in "Stars and Stripes" bunting. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving aside freedom-of-speech for the moment, should we not also be asking 
ourselves just what exactly does, or does not, constitute "desecration" of the 
flag? Will all these then be illegal under the proposed amendment? 
</P>
<P>
As far as the question of flag burning as valid political expression, or "an 
inarticulate grunt," as Chief Justice William Rehnquist has termed it, we need 
only turn again to the July 2nd Times. There on the front page is a picture of 
Chinese students here in Los Angeles protesting the actions of their government 
by burning China's national flag and the Communist Party's flag. An 
inarticulate grunt? The editors of The Times seem to think not. Neither do I. 
And neither, I'd guess, do the majority of your readers.

Surely the Founding Fathers never had in mind the burning of the American flag 
when they penned the First Amendment to the Constitution! Since when does an 
act of the will (burning the flag) equal the spoken word (freedom of speech)? 
</P>
<P>
I deplore the recent Supreme Court decision which allows anyone the freedom to 
desecrate the American flag when he is disgruntled, while standing on its ashes 
with raised fist against America. Bravo, President Bush; plaudits to you for 
standing up for this American symbol. Patriotism has never gone out of style,

CAL POLY ON ENVIRONMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest Anne C. Roark's article "UCLA Identifies a Major Source of 
Pollution -- Itself" (Metro, June 15). Cal Poly Pomona shares UCLA's concern 
about the degradation of the environment. Furthermore, we are deeply committed 
to dealing with environmental issues as part of our ongoing university 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly Pomona has been one of the pioneers in the use of recycled waste 
water. In the 1960s and 1970s, we used reclaimed water to irrigate about 25% of 
the campus. Today, we rely on reclaimed water for over 95% of our campus 
landscape. We also used reclaimed water to grow tree fruits, vegetables, grains 
and ornamental plants. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Poly has demonstrated its commitment to significant environmental issues in 
other ways as well. In 1985, the university signed a historic agreement 
establishing the Spadra Landfill and Resource Conservation Project, a joint 
project between the California State University, the L.A. County Sanitation 
Districts, and Los Angeles County. Combined with adjacent campus lands, this 
agreement authorized the creation of a 339-acre landfill and land resource 
laboratory which we call "LandLab." 
</P>
<P>
This sanitary landfill provides opportunities for the university to conduct 
research on landfill, refuse recycling, and refuse-to-energy processes and 
their effects. 
</P>
<P>
As an active laboratory for experimenting with and demonstrating ways of using 
and sustaining resources, LandLab supports a diverse range of activities to 
serve the educational, research, and leisure needs of the university and the 
communities we serve. 
</P>
<P>
Universities have a unique role to play in addressing the environmental 
problems our society faces. Cal Poly Pomona will continue to emphasize its 
commitment to addressing these critical concerns.

JAPAN'S POLITICAL SYSTEM IS THE CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE MOCHIZUKI, Mike Mochizuki is on the faculty of the School of 
International Relations at USC. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is nothing new about Japanese politicians having mistresses. Why then has 
Prime Minister Sosuke Uno's affair with a geisha plunged the ruling Liberal 
Democratic Party into its deepest crisis since it was formed in 1955? 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the expose has upset party plans for surmounting the Recruit 
scandal. Although Uno's selection as prime minister did not receive 
enthusiastic support within the party, it was hoped that he would restore the 
Liberal Democrats' tarnished image. He had not received Recruit stocks; and 
being a haiku poet, he was considered to be a man of letters. The idea was to 
have his personal popularity compensate for his shaky support within the party. 
</P>
<P>
The former geisha's revelations shattered this scenario. Further sensational 
reports in the Western press about the "sex scandal" fed back into Japan. 
Opposition leaders accused Uno of causing an international embarrassment, and 
women's groups began to mobilize. From the Japanese perspective, the issue is 
not so much that Uno had extramarital affairs, but that he had failed to behave 
according to traditional gentlemanly norms. Uno was portrayed as cheap, 
abrasive and hot-headed. 
</P>
<P>
As he became a liability, his party suffered a shocking defeat in a by-election 
held in Niigata, and sharp losses in Sunday's Tokyo Assembly elections. 
</P>
<P>
The current crisis, however, goes beyond money, politics and Uno's 
shortcomings. It involves a crisis of the Japanese political economy. Japan's 
changing position in the world economy is forcing the Liberal Democrats to 
shift their mass base from farmers and small businesses to the urban middle 
class of salaried employees and consumers. But the political system is making 
this transition difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Under American pressure, the government liberalized beef and citrus trade and 
is now trying to restructure the distribution system to increase imports. This 
spring, the Liberal Democrats pushed through a "consumption tax" to reform the 
tax system, which has favored the self-employed, and to cover the burgeoning 
costs of social programs. Although these reforms are ultimately in the interest 
of the middle class, the majority of the electorate, they have not strengthened 
the LDP. 
</P>
<P>
The economic liberalization measures taken have not dramatically benefitted 
consumers. Prices on imports have not dropped in proportion to yen 
appreciation. Land prices have risen so rapidly that purchasing a home is now 
beyond the reach of most Japanese in metropolitan areas. Rather than mobilizing 
urban supporters, agricultural liberalization has merely provoked a farmer 
backlash. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the conservatives compromised so much with small-business groups 
in getting the new tax passed that it is now hard to see how the reform 
benefits the wage earner. Rather than correcting the inequities of the system, 
the consumption tax has given small businesses a windfall while burdening the 
consumer. 
</P>
<P>
The only way that Japan can move decisively to harmonize its economy with the 
rest of the world is to have the interests of salaried employees and consumers 
more clearly reflected in the political process. This can only be done through 
a sweeping change of the electoral and party systems. 
</P>
<P>
Malapportionment gives much greater weight to rural voters compared to their 
urban counterparts. The system of medium-sized districts perpetuates a pattern 
of patron-client politics that favors agricultural and small-business interests 
and causes LDP politicians to require huge amounts of money to maintain their 
support organizations. A shift to a system that combines single-member 
districts and proportional representation and establishes equality across votes 
would go a long way in overcoming political rigidities. 
</P>
<P>
The irony is that the conservative LDP, and not the "progressive" opposition, 
has been the primary political force behind reform. Instead of vigorously 
appealing to wage earners by pushing for better and cheaper housing, 
lower-priced imports and domestic-demand stimulation, the left has been seeking 
farm and small-business support with even more protectionist rhetoric than the 
Liberal Democrats. The recent initiatives for major electoral reform have come 
from LDP ranks and not the opposition. The problem with this conservative-led 
reform process is that it has been too slow and too fraught with political 
contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
With the Liberal Democrats in disarray, the opposition parties have a golden 
opportunity to make a breakthrough. They should overcome their organizational 
fragmentation and put aside their anachronistic ideological disputes. They 
should develop an alternative political vision that is both imaginative and 
realistic. As for the LDP, a defeat in the upcoming upper house elections will 
hopefully shock the party enough to choose a more attractive leadership and 
follow through on political reform. 
</P>
<P>
This is a critical period in Japanese political history. Leaders on both the 
right and the left must have the courage to break with past practices. If not, 
popular cynicism about democratic politics will spread, and false and dangerous 
alternatives will emerge as Japan gets buffeted by foreign pressures. Much is 
at stake, not only for Japan, but for the world at large.

A FEW LOSERS MIGHT CLEAN UP ETHICS MESS

When Tony Coelho announced his plans to resign from the House of 
Representatives, I spent a few days considering whether to run in the special 
election to fill his post. 
</P>
<P>
I decided not to, mainly because I figured I couldn't win. (It's not that I'm 
all that unpopular. It's just that in a big part of the district I'm not known 
well enough to be unpopular.) But there was another reason, one that continues 
to trouble me: To get elected to Congress today, you have to play the game that 
created this whole "ethics" mess. 
</P>
<P>
There's a lot wrong with American politics right now. Here is the short list: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The absolute dominance of money in the political world. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The pervasiveness of career politicians, who are obsessed with survival and 
lack the wisdom and independence that come from having experience and a source 
of livelihood outside the world of politics. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The superficiality of news coverage and the inability of the media to let 
an issue take time to develop. The immediacy of television turns every problem, 
from pit bulls to freeway shootings, into a crisis requiring an instant 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The emergence of special interest groups and one-issue constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The end-justifies-the-means mentality of many political consultants, 
leading to cheap-shot attacks and misleading advertising in campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The virtual elimination of privacy for elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
The most troublesome of these is the first one. Tony Coelho probably did as 
much as any one person to marry up big money with the Democratic Party; in the 
old days, Fat Cats gave primarily to the Republicans. But Coelho made the 
rather compelling argument that if you really want bang for your political 
bucks, it's not very wise to ignore the party that controls Congress. 
</P>
<P>
This new arrangement did several things: It upped the ante in congressional 
campaigns. Total spending on House and Senate races went from $72 million in 
1974 to $471.4 million in 1986. Political action committee contributions rose 
during the same period, $8.5 million to $132.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
There were other results of the link between money and politics. Job security 
of incumbent Democrats was enhanced; in the meantime, the idealism of the 
Democratic Party was drained as the connection between contributions and public 
policy tightened. Then congressional Democrats began to distance themselves 
from everyday people and started running around with a wealthier crowd. All of 
a sudden that $89,500 salary didn't seem like so much -- and taking honoraria 
from special interests to augment the family income seemed more justifiable. 
</P>
<P>
I've never felt comfortable with this new style of politics. So when Tony 
Coelho resigned, I thought this might be an ideal opportunity for me, another 
Democrat, to offer a new approach -- especially with all the national attention 
focused on the issue of ethics. 
</P>
<P>
But the problem is that if you want to change Congress, you first have to get 
elected. And there's the rub: To get elected, you have to raise a ton of money 
and then do a mass-merchandising-type campaign. (In the special primary 
election to replace Coelho, if you were a candidate, you would need to hustle 
about $200,000 in six weeks, which would be used on TV spots that say you're 
not like those money-grubbers in Washington.) 
</P>
<P>
You enter the system hoping to change it -- and then realize that the price of 
entry was the compromise of the very ideals that motivated your candidacy in 
the first place. 
</P>
<P>
If you try to run a different kind of campaign (no contributions over $100 or 
no TV ads, for instance), you lose -- and probably look silly in the process. 
But that is what it may take to break down the money-game style of politics. It 
may take people who are willing to lose a few for the cause -- and suffer the 
embarrassment of being branded a "loser" or (and this is even worse in the 
political world) a "nonplayer." After a few years out in the vineyard, their 
message might get through to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
In order to make ethics fever go away, the House of Representatives will 
probably adopt new rules regarding honoraria and conflicts of interest. But the 
real problem gets back to the voters themselves. Will they refuse to be taken 
in by slick, superficial, misleading campaigns? And will they rebel against the 
money-driven system that protects incumbents and rewards candidates who play 
ball with special interests? 
</P>
<P>
Until they do, they should know that new members of Congress will have made the 
same compromises and gone through the same rite of initiation as the current 
members.

THE REPUBLIC SURVIVES HIGH CRIMES AND ERRORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN M. YODER JR., Edwin M. Yoder Jr. is a syndicated columnist in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The crimes for which Judge Gerhard Gesell sentenced Oliver L. North probably 
did some short-run damage to the nation's institutions. But the myth that what 
North did was "heroic" could eventually do more. Judge Gesell was therefore 
wise not to add luster to the martyr's crown by giving North jail time. 
</P>
<P>
North was, in the end, convicted of relatively piddling crimes -- tampering 
with evidence, "deceiving" Congress, taking an illegal gratuity. The Republic 
survived them. 
</P>
<P>
But as Judge Gesell noted in his superb sentencing statement, Oliver North was 
heir to a theory of executive power which could, in the long run, cause the 
Republic real trouble. Under that theory, largely born of the exigencies of the 
Cold War, dirty jobs occasionally need doing in far-flung places -- a shah 
restored to power in Iran, or some leftist politician toppled in the tropics or 
the jungles. And such jobs simply couldn't wait upon the sluggish processes of 
democratic argument or congressional deliberation. 
</P>
<P>
That theory had entered a temporary eclipse under Jimmy Carter. But it was 
boldly resurrected by Ronald Reagan's director of the Central Intelligence 
Agency, the late William Casey, a swashbuckler who never recovered from his 
early romance with the Office of Strategic Services. 
</P>
<P>
Under Casey, covert operations reached a height of brazenness in the 
extra-legal war against the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua, a government with 
which the United States maintained the facade of correct diplomatic relations. 
In that project, Oliver North was, so Judge Gesell concluded, essentially an 
errand boy -- "a low-ranking subordinate working to carry out the initiatives 
of a few cynical superiors." Errand boys are accountable for what they do, but 
that accountability must be proportional. 
</P>
<P>
The long American tradition of military abstention from politics, observed by 
the nation's most illustrious warriors from Washington to Eisenhower, has left 
us unprepared to cope with small-fry Marine colonels who take executive power 
into their own hands. North gave a good imitation of regret at his trial. But 
as a witness before the joint Iran-Contra committees the summer before last, he 
seemed at times to embrace a mild Bonapartism -- a theory that when the stakes 
are high, soldiers must do what effete civilian officials are too irresolute to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
The effete civilians North mainly bypassed were the members of Congress, and in 
some ways they asked for it. The early congressional response to the war in 
Nicaragua was irresolute and half-baked. Instead of moving vigorously to 
monitor and check initiatives that were pursued in defiance of its will, 
Congress loaded appropriations bills with successive versions of the Boland 
Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
The Boland Amendment was a sort of advisory to the Reagan Administration that 
it was being naughty and should cease and desist. Indeed, these advisories 
barely made a dent in the official Reagan Administration theory that foreign 
policy is an executive preserve, not to be poached upon by the people's 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
In the Administration's view, the Boland Amendment reflected a political clash 
between the White House and Congress over the exercise of war powers. It was 
not constitutionally serious and therefore to be disregarded. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is that neither branch distinguished itself in the struggle of which 
Oliver North's operation became the centerpiece. North's principal job was to 
raise money from gullible widows and skim arms-sale proceeds to supply the 
Contras. It was another episode in a long history of irregular foreign-policy 
operations in the White House, insufficiently checked by Congress, the 
judiciary or public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Gesell's lenient sentence gives North a chance to educate himself. The 
education is needed; for as the judge observed, there is no evidence so far 
that North has reached "full understanding . . . of how the public service has 
been tarnished" by his irregular and illegal activities. To the contrary, 
North's admirers have encouraged him to think of himself as a martyr in the 
Contra cause, a "hero" whose legal ordeal is the politically motivated result 
of press and Democratic vindictiveness. 
</P>
<P>
If North is confused about constitutional principles, it must be said that his 
confusion is fed by a larger public confusion. Forty-five years of Cold War 
have warped U.S. political institutions. The "long, twilight struggle" 
proclaimed by John F. Kennedy in his famous inaugural address was worth waging. 
But it took its toll. 
</P>
<P>
It schooled Presidents in defiance of the law, intimidated Congress and 
disposed the American public to excuse almost any project, however ominous or 
counterproductive, that was said to serve the cause of anti-communism. Indeed, 
Oliver North needs an education in "constitutional values," as Judge Gesell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But in that need, he is far from alone.

SALKELD SIGNS WITH MARINERS FOR RECORD SUM 
</P>

Roger Salkeld finally signed on the dotted line Thursday, pocketing a bonus of 
$225,000 as the Seattle Mariners made the Saugus High right-hander the 
highest-paid draft pick in the club's 13-year history. 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld (6-foot-5, 210 pounds), the third player selected in last month's 
amateur draft, will be assigned to Bellingham (Wash.), the club's rookie-league 
affiliate, Saturday in Spokane. 
</P>
<P>
After signing the contract, Salkeld, who watched the Mariners' game against 
Minnesota in the Kingdome on Wednesday night, immediately began throwing in the 
Mariners' bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
"I was out there all day, taking batting practice, shagging balls," Salkeld 
said from Seattle. "It was exciting and fun. It was a learning experience." 
</P>
<P>
Seattle officials expressed satisfaction at having Salkeld in the fold. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased to sign him and to have him in the organization at such a 
young age," said Dave Aust, the team's director of public relations. "He should 
move through the organization quickly and make the major leagues. He was in the 
clubhouse last night and he was pretty wide-eyed." 
</P>
<P>
The signing bonus is the largest awarded a Seattle draft pick, exceeding the 
$160,000 bonus received by Ken Griffey Jr. in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the bonus, Salkeld will receive incentive bonuses worth $7,500 based 
on his progress through the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Salkeld, this season's Southern Section 3-A Division Player of the Year, was 
13-1 with an 0.57 earned-run average and 178 strikeouts in 108 2/3 innings. He 
led the Centurions to the division title game at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
His career totals include a 30-7 record and 404 strikeouts in 266 1/3 innings.

SUE PITTINATO TAKES ON VENTURA RACEWAY AFTER ESTABLISHING HERSELF AT SAUGUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is a nice girl like Sue Pittinato doing dressed in grimy racing coveralls, 
preparing to wedge a crash helmet over her curly brown mane and climb into her 
pink and purple Chevelle for a few laps around the track at Saugus Speedway? 
</P>
<P>
Oh, please! Enough chauvinist comments. And no more jokes about women drivers. 
Hasn't she heard enough in her six-year racing career? 
</P>
<P>
Pittinato, 26, is one of the few women behind the wheel at either Saugus or 
Ventura Raceway and the only woman to race regularly in the Street Stock 
division at Saugus. Between pit stops at her parents' home in West Hills, 
Pittinato, along with racing partner Jon Christensen of Palmdale, is the only 
driver to race regularly at both tracks. 
</P>
<P>
Competing in a predominantly male sport, however, has made her the target of 
occasional sexist barbs. As if moving up from the Hobby Stock division, in 
which she finished eighth last season, was not difficult enough, Pittinato has 
had to adjust to a new field of competitors in her rookie season on the 
one-fifth-mile dirt oval at Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"She's pretty damn good," says Christensen, a 10-year Saugus veteran. "We 
always tease her, 'You drive just as good as a guy.' She kind of gets mad." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, however, Pittinato, who flashes a friendly smile and laughs 
heartily when recalling her racing encounters, is not offended. "It has made me 
uncomfortable," she says. "But they're treating me OK now." 
</P>
<P>
Off the track Pittinato works for an insurance company, reviewing 
worker-compensation claims. But on the track, she insists that she is not 
making a feminist statement. And she is not, as you may have guessed, the 
product of a tomboy, grease monkey, hand-me-that-wrench childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know anything about cars," she says. "Not as much as I need to 
know. It's not a lack of wanting to know; I want to learn. I'm not totally 
mechanically inclined." 
</P>
<P>
So, if you'll pardon the sexist cliche, exactly what is a nice girl like Sue 
Pittinato doing in a stock car? Quite simply, just trying to have some good, 
filthy fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it," she says. "I love it. I've always liked fast cars. Not that I 
always wanted to do it, but once I did it. . . . It's almost like an 
addiction." 
</P>
<P>
As for the attention, she adds, "I think it's neat because I want more women to 
get into it." 
</P>
<P>
Based on her track record, Pittinato sets a good example. She is 11th among the 
Ventura oval division points leaders and has won one main event and two heat 
races. At Saugus, Pittinato is 32nd and has yet to win a main event. But her 
place in the standings is deceiving because she refuses to compete in figure 8 
main events, in which drivers earn roughly half their points. 
</P>
<P>
"I am frightened, in a way," she said of figure 8 events. And despite the barbs 
at both tracks, Pittinato has earned the respect of fellow drivers as a 
qualified competitor. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing you think is that, 'She's a girl and I don't want to bang on 
her,' " said Rick Crow of Canyon Country, who also moved this season from Hobby 
Stock to Street Stock. "But then you think, 'That doesn't matter because she's 
just as good as anyone.' As far as I'm concerned, she warrants any treatment 
that I warrant. In fact, I ran into her a couple of weeks ago." 
</P>
<P>
Pittinato has fared better at Ventura where she "loves the dirt." 
</P>
<P>
"She is better than, I'd say, 85% of the guys out here," said Charles Utts of 
Camarillo, the track's Street Stock points leader. "She doesn't want to tear up 
the equipment like a lot of drivers in the lower echelon of racing. I don't 
know her background, but she's been hanging around some good people." 
</P>
<P>
That includes Christensen, who has sacrificed his own career this season to 
serve as Pittinato's mechanic, although he does get on the track weekly, using 
Pittinato car to drive in the figure 8 events that she sits out. Three months 
ago, Christensen, wrench in hand, approached Pittinato in the pits at Saugus. 
They have been a team since. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the guys here will come over and start helping you," Pittinato said. 
"They don't ask, they just come over and start helping you. Some of them stick 
around, some of them don't." 
</P>
<P>
Christensen, whose car has remained idle this season, says that he is committed 
to Pittinato's cause. "I think that with the right equipment Sue could be just 
as fast as anybody," he said. "As a matter of fact, we're gonna start winning 
some races. 
</P>
<P>
"She's as good as any of the guys. I keep referring to her like the guys do and 
I don't want to talk like that. She is a lady." 
</P>
<P>
Becoming one of the, er, guys, however, hasn't been easy, especially at Ventura 
where Utts describes the atmosphere as cliquish. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure she was a little uneasy," Utts said, "because, usually, the Ventura 
crowd doesn't race at Saugus. So, she's not only a girl, she's stepping into a 
scene where all the racers have grown up together. So we're all thinking, 
'What's this lady going to do?' " 
</P>
<P>
After an introductory stroll through the pits, where she said she was greeted 
by a few "lewd remarks," Pittinato considered making a U-turn before lining up 
for qualification. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to go home," she said. "One guy said, 'Oh, my God, it's a broad!' 
They were trying to intimidate me. But I got used to it. I was a new driver and 
sometimes they give new drivers a hard time anyway, whether you're a girl or a 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
Rather than flee the scene of the grime, Pittinato steered her car onto the 
track -- and away from any incidents that would brand her a "woman driver." 
</P>
<P>
"I was scared to death," Pittinato recalled. "People tried to come up to me 
before the race and say, 'Hey, Sue, how's it goin'?' And I'm like, 'Don't talk 
to me!' 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't real fast. I got lapped. But after we raced that night they all came 
over and shook my hand and they were all happy. It was just the first time and 
I had never been there before." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, she had been there before, figuratively speaking. The incident was 
reminiscent of her Saugus debut. After competing for a year in the all-women 
Powder Puff division at Indian Dunes, Pittinato declined to enter a similar 
division at Saugus in favor of the Hobby Stock class. 
</P>
<P>
Her male competition did not exactly offer her a warm reception. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard mumblings and grumblings about how they were going to put me into a 
wall," she said. "I'd hear them saying it, but they didn't know I was there. 
Nobody ever said anything to me. The first time out the stands were full, and, 
I swear to God, my leg was shaking. I just hoped I wouldn't cause problems." 
</P>
<P>
She didn't. And neither did any of the other drivers, who welcomed her after 
the race with handshakes of approval. Today, that approval has seemingly been 
earned at Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"They're really friendly toward her now," said Cliff Morgan, Ventura's track 
manager. "And the crowd really likes her." 
</P>
<P>
Said Utts: "I thoroughly enjoy racing with her. She runs hard and she's a good 
competitor. She has more than proved herself to me." 
</P>
<P>
Establishing herself as a good driver is all that Pittinato is striving to do. 
And, like it or not, she has become a reluctant role model for would-be women 
stock car drivers. 
</P>
<P>
"Some girls have come up to me and said, 'We watched you race and we thought, 
if you can do it, we can do it,' " she said. "It's a hobby, but I'd like to go 
as far as I can. I just want to race and do good. When I don't do good, I don't 
have a good time."

ONLY A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE VALLEY, SYCAMORE CANYON OFFERS CAMPERS ACCESS TO 
BOTH OCEAN AND MOUNTAIN RECREATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Sycamore Canyon is home to deer, bobcat, fox, coyote, an occasional mountain 
lion, 200 species of birds, 880 kinds of flowers and a member of Homo sapiens 
who calls himself "the trudgin' curmudgeon." 
</P>
<P>
On any given Sunday, park visitors can catch a glimpse of Lu Haas, a hearty 
septuagenarian from the Sierra Club who leads hikers on flower-sighting 
odysseys through canyon back country that hasn't changed much since the Chumash 
Indians etched petroglyphs in mountain caves thousands of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the basic food of the Chumash," Haas says, crushing a leaf of purple 
sage in his gloved hand. 
</P>
<P>
But even if nature walks aren't your idea of an outdoor experience, Sycamore 
Canyon probably still has something for you. With 55 campsites and hot showers, 
it's a full-service park that provides a highly unusual recreational double: 
the mountains and the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
But its best virtue may be its proximity. At the eastern edge of 15,000-acre 
Point Mugu State Park, Sycamore Canyon is less than an hour's drive from the 
Valley. Pacific Coast Highway cuts between the canyon and the surrounding Santa 
Monica Mountains on one side and Sycamore Cove and the ocean on the other. An 
easily accessible tunnel beneath the highway leads from the campgrounds to the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
Although the basic food in the area is now more along the lines of barbecued 
hot dogs, the Chumash would have no trouble recognizing their old stomping 
grounds. Sprawling sycamore trees with giant crooked branches reaching out like 
tentacles still rise off the canyon floor. The chaparral in the mountains 
remains in its natural state. 
</P>
<P>
Man's presence, however, has been felt ever since Portuguese explorer Juan 
Rodriguez Cabrillo dropped anchor there in 1542. California live oaks, valued 
as fuel, were almost all eliminated from the canyon. And fire roads and 
footpaths crisscross the mountains like surgical scars. Brown bears once roamed 
the mountainside, but they disappeared years ago. 
</P>
<P>
As L. A.'s neighborhood wilderness, the park suffers from urban fallout. Like 
most state parks, it is immensely popular in the summer, booked on weekends 
from Memorial Day to Labor Day, but the pressure on Sycamore Canyon is 
intensified because of its location. As with a good restaurant, reservations 
are necessary, even during the week. 
</P>
<P>
The campground is run by state park rangers, who patrol the campsites that lie 
beneath the ancient sycamores. At the entrance to the park, just off PCH, 
visitors have to check in at the ranger station to be assigned a campsite. 
Prime campsites are Nos. 30, 32, 50 and 52, but they're on a first-come, 
first-served basis. 
</P>
<P>
People go to a park for different reasons. Some like to hike and swim. Others 
like to sit around a fire and incinerate marshmallows. A few prefer to sip 
vodka tonics and enjoy the scenery while listening to music on a portable 
radio. To them, Sycamore Canyon probably will be a disappointment. Yosemite it 
is not. A lot of campsites are neither very private nor are they pristine. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the retirees who come in with their RVs and leave the place a mess," says 
Blake Richard, a park aide. 
</P>
<P>
The joy of staying at Sycamore Canyon is to get out of your campsite and 
explore. At the back of the campground is the gateway to the mountains, trails 
that lead into the Santa Monicas and other canyons. Most popular is the Scenic 
Trail, which ascends the mountains at an angle steep enough to require a rest 
on a wooden bench about halfway up. As the climber goes higher, the valley 
below disappears along with the hum of trucks on PCH. Only the thundering surf 
can be heard, and then it begins to fade, replaced by sounds of the wind 
running across the prairie grasses. 
</P>
<P>
Walking to an altitude of 1,300 feet, the climber has his choice of stunning 
vistas: To the south, beneath rugged cliffs, the blue Pacific stretches to the 
horizon, a ribbon of white foam lining the beaches; to the north is Old Boney, 
at 3,000 feet the highest mountain in the range. The intrepid hiker can hook up 
with Overlook Trail and make a tough trek to La Jolla Valley, where rock caves 
have been chiseled into the hillsides by wind and erosion. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the journey on the Scenic Trail isn't recommended for anybody who 
is out of shape, it is really no tougher than walking up the stairs at the 
Sherman Oaks Galleria. The sun is a potential hazard -- experienced hikers will 
take along a canister of water -- but an even graver threat are the mountain 
bikers who sometimes whip around a switchback without regard to their safety or 
anyone else's. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a problem with bicycles," Ranger Brit Horn says. "There have been 
accidents and lawsuits with bikes running into and over people in the hills." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from giving nature lectures, Horn and four or five other rangers are 
responsible for maintaining law and order. This means enforcing quiet hours 
after 10 p.m. and making sure that pets aren't brought into the park; their 
scent scares away indigenous wildlife. Occasionally, Horn says, a cooler will 
be stolen, usually by kids looking for beer. Cars parked by surfers on PCH 
sometimes get swiped or broken into. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers, Horn says, like to party in the canyon. "We pour (out) a lot of 
beer and either cite for or confiscate marijuana," he says. During Easter 
weekend, "We definitely had near-riot conditions" because of "a major 
gathering" of kids, perhaps gang members, Horn says. "We've had a little bit of

Except the cunning and elusive mountain lion. Although deer are common and 
reminders of other animals are found along the trails -- Horn has yet to cross 
paths with the big cat. But, he says, "Reliable sources have told me that a 
mountain lion or two are in the range."

STUDENTS AT SAN DIEGO SCHOOL OF BASEBALL AREN'T LIKELY TO BE CAUGHT PLAYING

There were no runs, no hits and plenty of errors. But this was great baseball, 
the kind that players from Abner Doubleday to Zane Smith would have loved. 
</P>
<P>
Nine-year-old Brent Delhamer of Coronado said he had a fantastic time, and he 
made just as many blunders as everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
"I must have had fun," Brent said, "because it only seemed like 30 minutes to 
me, and it was three hours." 
</P>
<P>
This was baseball the way it was meant to be learned. There were no games or 
teams this day -- just drills stressing the fundamentals, with emphasis on fun. 
Those teaching were professors of the San Diego School of Baseball, which held 
one of its many camps this week at Grossmont College. 
</P>
<P>
Brent came to the school to learn the proper and finer points of catching. 
"Sometimes a guy will throw a bat, and it will fly into my ribs. But other than 
that, I like being a catcher," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Brent might grow up to be the next Benito Santiago (his favorite player) or 
possibly a land developer like Jim Delhamer (his father). 
</P>
<P>
But for now, Brent is doing a pretty good job of being 9, and he is the type of 
kid who might have spent a lot of time at Bob Cluck's house in the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Cluck, a former San Diego High and San Diego State player, was then a minor 
league pitcher who had built a batting cage in his back yard. Soon, 
neighborhood kids were coming over for swings and instructions, and Cluck had a 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, the San Diego School of Baseball was founded, with Cluck providing 
lessons to the community youngsters. In '73, Cluck added Bob Skinner and Roger 
Craig (both Padre coaches at the time), and the school had its first camp at 
San Diego City College. 
</P>
<P>
Now in its 20th year, the nation's first and only year-round baseball school 
offers a variety of camps ranging in price from $85 to $340, private 
instruction, two state-of-the-art indoor batting facilities and a head full of 
memories and joy for ballplayers (6-22 years old), coaches and parents. 
</P>
<P>
"I came here to learn . . . and have some fun," said 11-year-old Eddie Lugo, 
who along with his friend, Javier Antunez, also 11, came from El Centro to 
participate in the three-day camp. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie accomplished a little of both early in the first three-hour session. He 
had signed up with Alexander to receive instructions as a pitcher, but just a 
few minutes later he wanted to know if he could switch to an infielders 
station. 
</P>
<P>
Don Alexander, the school's general manager, gave the OK and then inquired, 
"Are you Eddie Lugo?" After an affirmative reply, Alexander said, "It's not a 
good sign if I know your name 10 minutes into the program." 
</P>
<P>
Eddie laughed and hustled off with the other infielders. 
</P>
<P>
It is that kind of personal contact that makes these camps special for the kids 
and instructors, many of whom are former professional players and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
In the off-season, many major leaguers offer their services. Over the years, 
the school has attracted Willie Stargell, Pete Rose, Maury Wills, Dave 
Winfield, Don Sutton, Mike Scott, George Brett and Sparky Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Flannery, Eddie Williams, Mark McLemore and Matt Nokes are some of the 
local big leaguers who work extensively with the school. 
</P>
<P>
"Just being around those guys was special," recalled Alexander, who attended 
the school when he was a student at Hilltop High. "I remember how thrilled I 
was to be playing catch with Randy Jones the year after he won the Cy Young." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander, who went on to play at the University of San Diego, began working as 
an assistant at the school and eventually became general manager. He said that 
in a year there are about 1,000 students in the camps, including girls. There 
are about four or five year-round, full-time instructors and as many as 70 who 
help out. 
</P>
<P>
"These (instructors) work hard at these camps," Alexander said. "Sure it's fun, 
but they're out there 10, 12 hours a day for five days straight. Are they just 
going to show up, sign autographs and then leave? I get asked that all the 
time. That doesn't happen. They work. But they enjoy working with the kids." 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Skinner and Craig retired their shares in the company mostly because 
of time constraints, and Cluck offered partnerships to some of his other 
friends who were involved with the school. 
</P>
<P>
The school is now owned by seven partners: Cluck (now a minor league roving 
coach and scout with the Houston Astros), the Padres' Tony Gwynn, Houston's 
Dave Smith, Detroit's Alan Trammell, Houston scout Reggie Waller, Brent Strom, 
former Padre pitcher and now the Dodgers' minor league pitching instructor, and 
Kansas City Royals coach Glenn Ezell (a former Padre minor league manager). 
</P>
<P>
Smith (a former Poway High and San Diego State pitcher) and Trammell (a 
shortstop from Kearny High) were students at the school before becoming major 
league stars. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not the greatest businessmen in the world, but it's fun," Cluck said. 
"Maybe if we were (seven) guys who depended on it for mortgage checks, it might 
be different. But we're not. 
</P>
<P>
"The baseball school has been my baby from the beginning. I forget it's a 
business sometimes. I like to think of it as youth therapy." 
</P>
<P>
When the school opened its first batting facility in 1984, Cluck said it was 
the beginning of "Phase II" for the company, which has been growing steadily 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
"The batting cage is not a great business, it tends to be very seasonal. But it 
gives us a home base. It also made us expand to a year-round operation. We now 
had rent and other bills to pay." 
</P>
<P>
Cluck said that a few people or groups have wanted to buy franchises for other 
parts of the country. Jack Perconte, a former Dodger infielder, asked the San 
Diego School of Baseball for help getting him started with a similar program in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Others, including a group from the Midwest, wanted to buy the San Diego School, 
but Cluck and the other owners refused to sell. Said Cluck, "I told Tony 
(Gwynn) and he said, 'No way. Where would I hit?' The man's possessed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're afraid that if we get too big too fast, we'll spoil everything. We don't 
want people thinking that the camps are a bunch of spoiled little rich kids out 
for a picture and autographs. We want to provide the best instructional 
baseball for a reasonable charge. Guys who have million-dollar contracts, you 
couldn't pay these guys enough money to come out if they didn't want to. But 
they come out and work 12 hours a day." 
</P>
<P>
Cluck said he would like to add a few more batting cages and continue with the 
camps. Alexander said he wants to implement a certification program for the 
various youth leagues coaches around the county. 
</P>
<P>
He said there are often negative aspects to youth baseball. "We want to show 
them that baseball is fun. A lot of it is just improving (a player's) 
confidence. With some of them, just getting a glove on the ball is an 
improvement." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander added that "some of them want us to teach them to become major league 
players. That's not what we're here for, either. But we're going to point them 
in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
Some day you might hear of a Jair Sanchez from Sinaloa, Mexico, in the major 
leagues. He attended this week's camp at Grossmont, as did Guillermo Macalpin, 
Ruffino Montoya and six of their teammates from the Mexicali Cachoros (Cubs). 
</P>
<P>
Guillermo, 10, a talented left-handed pitcher, might just make it to the 
majors. He already knows how to deal with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Guillermo, did you have fun today? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes." 
</P>
<P>
Did you learn anything today? "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
Do you want to someday play in the major leagues? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes." 
</P>
<P>
He was short on words, but the smile on his face spoke volumes. And the message 
was clear: This was baseball, not a game, but the game. 
</P>
<P>
And this was learning baseball the way it was meant to be learned. 
</P>

done, too, as can be seen clockwise from top: Ryan Leighty works on his

DRAFT TODAY STILL A MYSTERY FOR CHARGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
About all the Chargers know for sure regarding their position in today's NFL 
supplemental draft is that they will have one of the first nine picks. The rest 
is speculation. 
</P>
<P>
The guessing concerns the three top players available -- running back Bobby 
Humphrey of Alabama and quarterbacks Timm Rosenbach of Washington State and 
Steve Walsh of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Those three are easily the best known of the 12 players the NFL has said are 
eligible to be selected. All could be taken in the first round, possibly before 
the Chargers have an opportunity to select. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers will not learn where they will pick until sometime shortly before 
the draft begins in New York at 10 a.m. PDT. Order will be determined by a 
weighted lottery. 
</P>
<P>
The NFL has placed its 28 teams into three groups to determine the order. The 
Chargers, as one of nine teams with six or fewer victories last season, are in 
the first group of teams and assured of picking no later than ninth. 
</P>
<P>
The second group is made up of the nine remaining non-playoff teams and will 
have the 10th through 18th selections. The final group consists of the 10 teams 
that made the playoffs and will be assigned the 19th through 28th picks. 
</P>
<P>
Each team will, within its group, be assigned a number of lottery chances based 
on its finish. The team with the worst record, Dallas, will have 28 chances. 
Green Bay will receive 27, Detroit 26 and so on until Super Bowl champion San 
Francisco, which has one chance. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, with the eighth worst record, will have 21 lottery chances. 
Because there will be 216 markers among the first nine teams, the Chargers odds 
of gaining the first pick in the draft are roughly one in 10. 
</P>
<P>
The supplemental draft is used to disperse players not available during the 
regular draft April 23-24. Most are players who elected to give up their final 
year of college eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the interest for the Chargers centers on Rosenbach and Walsh. 
Quarterback has been a weakness since the retirement of Dan Fouts, but the 
question is whether the Chargers, who traded with the New York Giants for an 
extra second-round pick to take Billy Joe Tolliver of Texas Tech in the regular 
draft, will want to spend another pick on that position. 
</P>
<P>
A team choosing a player in the supplemental draft will forfeit its 
corresponding choice in the 1990 regular draft. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers also could trade their position in the draft -- but any trade must 
be made before the lottery -- or they could draft one of the top available 
players and trade him after the draft. Or they could simply pass. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbach is considered by scouts the best available player. At 6-feet-2 and 
210 pounds, he led the nation in passing efficiency last season. In two years 
as a starter, he passed for 5,995 yards in Washington State's quick-drop 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, 6-3, 195 pounds, is not considered to have as strong an arm, but he 
passed for 5,364 career yards and a school-record 48 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, who have an abundance of running backs, might have less interest 
in Humphrey. He was expected to be one of the leading running backs in the 
country last season, but he played only two games before breaking a bone in his 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
He rushed for 2,726 yards and 26 touchdowns in the previous two seasons.

SPORTS ET CETERA: ADDITION OF ST. LOUIS ADDS GAMES TO MISL REGULAR SEASON, 
CREATES TWO DIVISIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The official addition of St. Louis to the Major Indoor Soccer League Thursday 
means the league will increase the number of regular-season games from 48 to 52 
and return to a two-division format for the 1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
The defending MISL champion Sockers will play in the Western Division along 
with Tacoma, Dallas and St. Louis, which has not yet selected a nickname. 
Baltimore, Cleveland, Kansas City and Wichita will make up the Eastern. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-year-old MISL fielded seven teams in one division last season but since 
has added Cleveland and St. Louis while losing the Los Angeles Lazers. 
</P>
<P>
BOXING 
</P>
<P>
The scheduled fight between San Diego's James Kinchen and World Boxing Assn. 
light-heavyweight champion Virgil Hill has been postponed because Hill is being 
treated for a blood sugar level disorder. The title bout, scheduled for Aug. 6 
in Bismarck, N.D., will probably be held sometime this fall, according to 
promoter Bob Arum. 
</P>
<P>
MEN'S BASKETBALL 
</P>
<P>
For the second consecutive year, there will be no city championship between the 
three San Diego NCAA Division I schools this season, because U.S. International 
and the University of San Diego could not reach an agreement in scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
USIU will have a record 17 home games at Golden Hall, including Cal (Dec. 5), 
the first Pac-10 team to play the Gulls in San Diego, and Loyola Marymount 
(Jan. 6). The Gulls will also play Oklahoma (Dec. 29) in Norman. 
</P>
<P>
USIU will play San Diego State at the San Diego Sports Arena Feb. 10, and the 
Aztecs will play USD Dec. 6, also at the Sports Arena. But USIU and USD, which 
have played for the past four years, will not meet this season. Last year, USD 
and SDSU did not play. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Zarecky, USIU's coach, said that he wanted to have a home-and-home series 
with USD or at least have USD come to Golden Hall once every three years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that we don't want to play USD," Zarecky's said, "but we feel that 
we're in a position in our program that we can establish a home-and-home series 
with these other schools. Fair is fair. 
</P>
<P>
"We've approached them and they said 'no.' I don't have any ill feeling or 
animosity, but I think it's a fairness situation." 
</P>
<P>
Said Hank Egan, USD's coach: "The only conversations I've had with Gary Zarecky 
are after he's gone to the papers with these things. After I read it in the 
papers, then I talk with Gary Zarecky. 
</P>
<P>
"Five years ago they weren't even on our schedule, and they begged us to get on 
our schedule."

IMPERIAL S&amp;L TO SHRINK ASSETS BY $2 BILLION, CHANGE STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, San Diego County Business Editor 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stung by its forays into unconventional loan activities, Imperial Corp. of 
America said Thursday that its Imperial Savings of California unit will shrink 
assets by 17% and reroute itself into more "traditional thrift activities." 
</P>
<P>
Imperial also said it expects to report a loss for the second quarter ended 
June 30, in part because of fallout from its purchase of a fraud-ridden auto 
loan portfolio from Glendora-based Grand Wilshire. Loan-loss provisions taken 
for the Grand Wilshire portfolio were largely responsible for Imperial's 
$25.2-million fourth-quarter 1988 loss and its minimal profit in this year's 
first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The plan to shrink assets by $2 billion is Imperial's direct response to 
stiffer, risk-based capital standards for savings and loans to be included in 
the $300-billion S&amp;L rescue bill being considered by Congress. To shrink 
assets, Imperial said Thursday, it will sell its $400-million auto lease 
portfolio and its $275-million bank card business as well as reduce its 
$1.35-billion "junk bond" portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
The company wouldn't specify the amount of reduction in its junk bonds, which 
represent 12% of Imperial's $11.9 billion in assets. The moves are to boost 
capital as a percentage of assets. 
</P>
<P>
The company also said it will "downsize" its commercial real estate lending 
activities. Although declining to specify the expected second-quarter loss, 
Imperial said it will make loan-loss provisions totaling at least $26 million 
to cover bad consumer and mobile-home loans. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial also said it expects a $10-million loss on the sale of its auto lease 
portfolio and a $22-million writedown in the value of certain junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Allan Bortel of Shearson Lehman Hutton in San Francisco estimated that 
the loss could total as much as $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial's change in strategy, announced after a daylong directors' meeting, 
had been expected for the past week and follows by three days the resignation 
of Imperial President Kenneth Thygerson by "mutual agreement" with Imperial's 
board. Thygerson was replaced by board member Allan Tessler, a New York 
attorney and financier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Moves by Thygerson 
</P>
<P>
After taking over as head of Imperial in September, 1985, Thygerson led the 
thrift into several non-traditional S&amp;L activities, including car and 
mobile-home loans and junk bonds, saying Imperial could not compete with larger 
S&amp;Ls in "plain vanilla" activities such as residential home lending. 
Imperial is the nation's 16th-largest thrift in terms of assets. 
</P>
<P>
Although ICA's "get rich quick strategy" failed, analyst Bortel said he saw no 
reason why ICA couldn't effect a "pretty good turnaround" later this year "if 
you got a chief executive who came in and rolled up his sleeves." Bortel noted 
ICA's relatively healthy interest rate spread, which is the difference between 
what it pays to depositors and receives from borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
The S&amp;L bailout bill will not only affect S&amp;Ls such as Imperial by 
forcing a reduction of junk bond investments but could eventually disallow the 
inclusion of good will in figuring shareholder equity. Carried as an asset on a 
company's balance sheet, good will is the amount of a purchase price above the 
book value. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Below Minimum 
</P>
<P>
Disallowing good will, ICA's tangible net capital now stands at only 1.61% of 
assets, well below the 3% minimum requirement expected in the bailout bill. To 
meet the capital requirements, ICA thus must either raise cash or shrink assets 
to improve its capital-to assets ratio. At ICA's April annual meeting, 
Thygerson said ICA had unsuccessfully been seeking a buyer or investor for the 
thrift. 
</P>
<P>
The junk bonds on which ICA is taking the $22-million writedown were issued by 
Integrated Resources. The loss is resulting from the recent downgrading of the 
credit-worthiness of the bonds' issuer, which reduces the securities' market 
value. Taken as a whole, ICA's $1.35-billion junk bond portfolio is worth $100 
million, or 8% less than what ICA paid for it, ICA vice president Andy 
Micheletti said.

THEATER GROUP GETS A SUMMER REPRIEVE FROM DISTRACTIONS 
</P>

Community center Ping-Pong games that interrupt rehearsals. Bustling country 
club kitchens that double as backstage areas. Noisy ice machines that plop 
during dramatic pauses on stage. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, for the first time since its inception in 1987, the Xanadu Theatre 
Company is enjoying a reprieve from the aforementioned distractions that have 
accompanied a company constantly on the move. 
</P>
<P>
The Conejo Valley-based, nonprofit troupe has finally found a home -- albeit a 
temporary one -- at the 90-seat Little Theatre on the campus of Cal Lutheran 
University in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Xanadu is performing in repertory Joe Orton's "Loot" and Tom Stoppard's "The 
Real Thing" Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays through July 22. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 volunteers are involved in the productions, which alternate each 
night. Many of the actors and almost all of the technicians and support 
personnel are residents of the San Fernando Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's wonderful having a place where all of the people involved in the company 
can come to rehearse and perform on a regular basis," said Xanadu founder Naomi 
Monroe. "We've had some real production adventures in the past, so this is 
luxury to us." 
</P>
<P>
Xanadu, which has no permanent home, secured the use of the Cal Lutheran 
theater through Michael Arndt and Mike Roehr, both of whom are drama professors 
at the university and members of the Xanadu board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things that makes theater so tough in this area is the community is 
so new," said Roehr, a Canoga Park resident and the company's set designer. 
"With a theater, when you start you usually find an old building that's not 
being used and you move into it. But there aren't any old buildings out here. 
So where do you go?" 
</P>
<P>
Arndt, a Minnesota native who lives in Agoura Hills, has directed more than 80 
professional and college productions, including several Xanadu shows. 
</P>
<P>
The relationship between the company and the university is mutually beneficial, 
said Arndt, who is directing the current production of "The Real Thing." 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons for my becoming involved with this project is to hopefully 
have a theater company that operates and builds in this community," Arndt said. 
"Another reason is for the university to have a link with a 
professional-quality theater because it provides opportunities for our 
students." 
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the current productions, Arndt is teaching a summer course 
through the university called "Professional Theatre in Performance." The class 
includes weekly lectures covering production aspects of play writing, 
directing, acting, stage management, design and technical production. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of a class-workshop," Arndt said. "Students are able to talk to 
members of the staff, actors and observe the process of -- even though we're 
not getting paid -- what we label professional theater." 
</P>
<P>
Monroe, a Newbury Park resident, started Xanadu after founding Actors for 
Children, an adult touring company that has brought theater to Valley-area 
children since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
A New York native who started a theater company in New Jersey, Monroe said she 
founded Xanadu to help fill a cultural void faced by adults in the Conejo 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We came together because we felt there was an opportunity and a need for a 
company in the area," Monroe said. 
</P>
<P>
Xanadu's first production, "The Dining Room," was directed by Arndt and staged 
with the help of a cultural grant from the city of Thousand Oaks at the Conejo 
Community Center. Now, Monroe said, ticket sales fund the productions. Xanadu 
usually budgets $2,500 for each show; the company is attempting to stage the 
current productions for $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
The company's next five productions, which included such shows as "Are You Now 
or Have You Ever Been . . .," "The Foreigner" and "Lunch Hour," were rehearsed 
and performed at community centers, libraries, schools and country clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past," Arndt said, "we've rehearsed in rooms where the actors had no 
idea what the stage was really going to be like until we got into dress 
rehearsal." 
</P>
<P>
Said Monroe, "It was a hassle design process-wise because the sets had to be 
struck and moved in 15 minutes so we didn't get charged overtime." 
</P>
<P>
The CLU Little Theatre is providing -- temporarily -- shop, rehearsal and 
performance space all in one location. 
</P>
<P>
"When we say this is a theater," Roehr said, "part of what we mean is we can 
leave the chairs up instead of taking them and the whole set down every night." 
</P>
<P>
For Roehr, the current productions presented the challenge of constructing sets 
that work for both plays and easily change over. 
</P>
<P>
"It's basically the same physical set redressed with different furniture," 
Roehr said. "The design more than the execution is the tricky part." 
</P>
<P>
The greatest challenge still facing the company, however, is its search for a 
permanent site. 
</P>
<P>
Once school begins in the fall, Xanadu is on the road again. The company will 
present Tina Howe's "Painting Churches" at the Conejo Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to be a theater in a space so people can identify us with one 
space," Arndt said. "We're still looking for a home."

PADUA PLAYWRIGHTS FESTIVAL FINDS NEW HOME AT CSUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Cal State Northridge has a new house guest this summer: the 12-year-old Padua 
Hills Playwrights Workshop/Festival, which has taken up residence at the 
university's Art and Design Center (and outlying dormitories and gathering 
spaces). Twenty-five participants have gathered from all over the country for 
the six-week session of writing workshops -- taught by 13 playwrights, 
including Tony winner David Henry Hwang, John Steppling, Jon Robin Baitz and 
Maria Irene Fornes -- which will culminate July 20 with an outdoors 
presentation of new works. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the kind of event this university needs to be involved in," said Jeff 
Levy, general manager of CSUN's theater and also a workshop participant. "We're 
interested in a collaboration between a professional company and the university 
-- one that serves the education of our students and faculty -- but also serves 
the theater by helping students move into the professional world. It can also 
be a resource for academia. If someone wants to do experimentation, the 
university can provide a place for it." 
</P>
<P>
The relationship began when Robert Caine of Sherman Oaks' Actors Alley (with 
whom CSUN has had an ongoing artistic relationship) put Levy in touch with 
Padua Hills Executive Director Cheryl Bianchi, which led to a January meeting 
with Levy and CSUN theater chairman Richard Shank. Shank then went to School of 
Arts Dean Philip Handler, who went to Bob Suzuki, vice president of academic 
affairs, who took the proposal to college President James Cleary. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it'd be wonderful to bring their creativity onto the campus, and 
they seemed interested in establishing themselves" in the San Fernando Valley, 
Shank said. (Since losing its original site in the San Gabriel foothills a few 
years ago, Padua has been held in a variety of locations.) "The Art and Design 
Center is a large configuration of buildings used by sculptors and 3-D artists. 
It makes several performance spaces. And there's a large courtyard that we've 
converted into an outdoor theater." 
</P>
<P>
CSUN is also providing room and board for the 13 playwrights and 25 students 
during their stay. "The value of those services is $5,000 to $6,000 -- so 
that's a major contribution," Levy said. "We're also picking up all the 
facility costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Two things need to happen for this relationship to be long-term. First, this 
summer has to go well. We're dating, but not married yet. And the university 
can't afford to provide complete support. So we'll need to look for funding 
resources to cover a percentage of our costs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd love to announce we're the home of Padua for the next five years," he 
added quickly. "I think it would inject dynamite into the student body, who are 
theatrically complacent. Most students want to make it in the entertainment 
industry. They don't really understand theater, what its value is. The other 
common misconception is that Arthur Miller or Sam Shepard sits down for awhile 
and comes up with a play. The students have no sense of workshop, the rehearsal 
period, the actor's voice. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
For Levy, the week-old workshop experience has already had a profound impact: 
"I can hardly sleep at night. To get real poetic, I feel this light coming into 
my body. It's rare to be around people with the same interests, with passions 
not in making money but creating and speaking the word. You know, the world is 
not very supportive of playwrights. Everyone talks about actors' theater or 
directors' theater -- but there's very little support of playwrights. Padua 
addresses that need squarely." 
</P>
<P>
Shank, too, is hoping that Padua's presence will stimulate an interest in new 
plays. With 300 majors in his department (divided between acting/directing, 
design and technical, theater history and dramatic literature), he's counting 
on the many students who live in the Valley for support: "One of our majors is 
enrolled in the writing workshop; others are in technical areas. I hope that 
our majors here will be a big part of the audience and that it spreads through 
word of mouth." 
</P>
<P>
A benefit retrospective will be held Sunday, featuring works from past Padua 
festivals -- some with their original casts. This year's festival program, 
which runs through Aug. 6 and is open to the public, features Susan 
Mosakowski's "Cities Out of Print," Martin Epstein's "The Ordeal of Nancy 
Fergusson," John Pappas' "Increments of Three," Alan Bolt's "Beloved Love," a 
new work by Steppling, Fornes' "Oscar and Martha," Leon Martell's "Kindling" 
and Julie Hebert's "Almost Asleep."

AT THE GALLERIES / LEAH OLLMAN: LA JOLLA ART MUSEUM USES GRANT FOR GOOD, NOT-SO 
GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Building a museum collection isn't what it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
The quiet, dignified transfer of works of art from private collections to 
public institutions has dwindled in recent years. Incentives to give have been 
smothered by the escalation of art market prices and a 1986 tax law that 
reduced and complicated the deductibility of donated art. 
</P>
<P>
Museums today must be more resourceful than ever to keep their collections 
growing. Responding, perhaps, to the search for acquisition funds, the Los 
Angeles-based Lannan Foundation last year initiated a grant program that 
awarded $50,000 each to three U.S. institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art received one grant. (The High Museum in 
Atlanta and the Hirshhorn in Washington received the others. 
</P>
<P>
The grants are earmarked for the purchase of works by "emerging or 
under-recognized" artists. 
</P>
<P>
The grant allowed the La Jolla Museum to add more than a dozen works to its 
collection. These works, and others by the same artists are on view at the 
museum through Aug. 6 in the show, "New Acquisitions: Gifts from the Lannan 
Foundation." 
</P>
<P>
In making its selections, the museum dipped briefly into painting, sculpture, 
video, photography and modest-sized installation work, spreading its purchases 
across a spectrum of expressive modes. Nearly half of the work bought was by 
local artists, a politic move on behalf of the museum but also an astute one, 
considering the integrity of most of the works chosen. 
</P>
<P>
David Avalos, one of the most dynamic presences in the San Diego art community, 
injects a spirit of tough poetry into the museum's collection, which had long 
focused on the spare symmetry of minimalist art. Love, violence and reverence 
converge in his concise assemblage, "Hubcap Milagro No. 6" (1986). Jagged tooth 
folds splay the dull gray heart at its center, revealing a red-streaked core or 
wound. Emerging like a proud emblem of passion from the top of the heart is a 
small object that reads simultaneously as lipstick, bullet and flame. Presented 
with the direct immediacy of an icon, "Hubcap Milagro" exudes an unyielding 
power, tinged with sacredness and fragility. 
</P>
<P>
Local photographer Elizabeth Sisco, whose works unfortunately were not 
purchased, undermines the smugly superior attitudes of American businessmen 
toward Mexico in her 1984 work, "El Paso/Juarez." She juxtaposes a statement 
from the American Chamber of Commerce listing the advantages of living in the 
United States while managing a Mexican plant with her own stark black-and-white 
images of the two border cities. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than reinforcing one another, as is typical of images and their 
captions, Sisco's photographs challenge the assumptions made by the industry 
official. When the text points out that an American family living near Mexico 
is afforded great cultural expansion, Sisco mocks the official's words by 
illustrating what many Americans regard as Mexican culture: curio shops and 
black velvet paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Also not purchased was Louis Hock's insightful video, "The Mexican Tapes: A 
Chronicle of Life Outside the Law." Hock and Sisco are included to supplement 
the display of a weaker, collaborative photo-mural that was purchased with 
Lannan grant funds. The museum has aptly identified several of the city's more 
capable artists, including Kenneth Capps and Raul Guerrero, but it has not 
consistently chosen their strongest works. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the Lannan grant, works from several recent exhibitions have become 
part of the museum's permanent collection, allowing the successes and failures 
of these shows to make a second round through the museum. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Vaughn's puerile constructions hardly deserve an encore, and William 
Leavitt's work looks as uneven now as it did during the museum's 1987 "LA2DA" 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
James Drake's installation, "Knife Table," sends a searing message about the 
coarse egoism of violence but without the subtlety and richness of the rest of 
his work shown earlier this year in the museum's downtown space. 
</P>
<P>
Two works by Eric Snell, both Lannan acquisitions, capture well the flavor of 
Snell's process-oriented art. Although the images themselves are unremarkable, 
Snell's use of the elemental forces of magnetic attraction and fire to create 
them imbues them with added meaning. 
</P>
<P>
Large-scale color photographs by Tina Barney add a refreshing dose of personal, 
narrative drama to the show, and likewise the collection. Like the 
turn-of-the-century French intimist painters, Barney monumentalizes the 
psychological nuances of upper-class family life. Whether focusing on the 
implicit communication and competition between mothers and daughters or the 
kaleidoscope of moods that encircles the daily breakfast table, Barney's work 
leaves much to ponder in the familiar scenes of everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
The sole video purchase in the show, Tony Oursler's futuristic "Joy Ride," is 
only moderately engaging, while Maurizio Pellegrin's spare wall arrangement of 
35 objects yields a mysterious, haunting power beyond its modest means. Each of 
the objects in "Distant Desires, Beyond the Garden" -- including a single 
glove, a framed, fragmented photograph and outmoded carrying cases for either 
golf clubs or guns -- is painted with black stripes and stenciled numbers. 
Mounted and identified thus, the objects assume the status of evidence, as if 
they were dispersed clues to an unknown crime. 
</P>
<P>
Pellegrin's installation, with many potential readings, shares a gallery with 
the large, pretentious, monochrome photographs of Barbara Ess. The hollow 
quality of Ess' images clashes not only with the evocative tension of 
Pellegrin's work but with the intelligence and independence that characterize 
the rest of the show.

PREVIEW: SHOW PAYS HOMAGE TO MUNOZ OLIVARES' WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He's painted portraits of presidents, taught in major universities and had his 
work shown in galleries all over Europe. But this year, painter Manuel Munoz 
Olivares is spending much of his long, hot summer in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Munoz Olivares made the trek to Ventura County from his home in Mexico City to 
paint a mural in the library of the new South Oxnard Center; his work will 
depict the history of the area. Tomorrow, he will take a break from painting to 
attend the opening of his one-man show at the Conejo Valley Art Museum in 
Thousand Oaks. On display will be nearly 40 examples of Munoz Olivares' 
paintings and drawings, which are on loan from the Lodi Gallery in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
As a young man, before his painting earned him an international reputation (and 
a steady living), Munoz Olivares made money as a writer and political 
cartoonist. At one point, he took a hiatus from painting to study engineering, 
but most of his 64 years have been devoted to art. 
</P>
<P>
"His work is figurative, working with the Florentine technique -- very 
precise," says Augusto Lodi, owner of Lodi Gallery. "Peasants are one of his 
most common subjects, all the people who really reflect the image of Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
And yet, Munoz Olivares is also a painter of Mexico's elite ruling class. As 
the official painter of the Mexican presidency, he has provided the portraits 
of Mexico's past eight presidents that hang in Mexico City's National Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
"It's interesting to see the contrast in his work, to see how he jumps from one 
point to another," Lodi said. His portraits of kings and presidents are, 
necessarily, formal and dignified. His depictions of peasants, however, are 
more passionate. One critic wrote that his "minutely detailed style of 
hyper-realism focuses on the emotions inherent in the ordinary gestures of 
everyday living." 
</P>
<P>
"You can see the soul of the people he paints," Lodi said. "It's as if they are 
talking to you." 
</P>
<P>
Much of Munoz Olivares' work has been published in book form. The latest, "El 
Mexico Que Se Nos Va" ("The Disappearing Mexico") depicts city life through 
street musicians, cobblers, bird sellers -- "the people," Lodi said, "who are 
disappearing as Mexico is changing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Manuel Munoz Olivares: Official Painter to the Mexican Presidency," runs 
tomorrow through July 30 at the Conejo Valley Art Museum, 191 W. Wilbur Road, 
Thousand Oaks. Artist's reception is from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. tomorrow. Museum 
hours are noon to 5 p.m. Wednesdays through Sundays. Admission free. Call (805) 
373-0054.
