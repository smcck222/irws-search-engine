SIMI VALLEY SCHOOL CHIEF TO RESIGN; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: JOHN DUNCAN SAYS HE WILL TAKE OVER THE TOP SPOT AT A NORTHERN 
CALIFORNIA DISTRICT IN THE FALL. 
</P>

<P>
Supt. John Duncan of the financially troubled Simi Valley Unified School 
District said Friday that he will resign this fall to take over as chief 
administrator of a Northern California district. 
</P>
<P>
Duncan, who has headed Ventura County's largest school district for 16 years, 
said his resignation will become effective Sept. 16. He said he has accepted 
the position of superintendent of the San Ramon Valley Unified School District 
in Contra Costa County, near Oakland. The job will pay $98,900, a year, about 
$2,000 more than what he makes in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in Simi Valley for 16 years," Duncan said. "Simi Valley has been 
awfully good to me. But I'm ready for a new challenge." 
</P>
<P>
Duncan, 57, said the district's struggle to offset an estimated $8-million 
budget shortfall next year did not enter into his decision to leave the 
18,000-student district. The budget crunch has forced district officials to lay 
off 32 temporary teachers, four librarians and four nurses at some of its 26 
campuses. Dozens of administrators were also reassigned to lower-level 
positions with reduced salaries. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the last five months, it's been very difficult . . . but it's very much 
like any other school district," said Duncan, who has been the subject of much 
criticism from teachers and union officials because of the cost-cutting 
measures. "They all have budget problems." 
</P>
<P>
Duncan said one reason he decided to leave Simi Valley is that several of his 
children live in the Bay Area. Another, he said, was the pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
He said he informed members of the Board of Education about his decision during 
a closed session Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll miss him and his outstanding leadership," board President Helen Beebe 
said. "He has left us a real heritage." 
</P>
<P>
Beebe also dismissed any notions that the district's budget problems had 
anything to do with Duncan's decision to leave. 
</P>
<P>
School officials have attributed a large part of the district's financial 
problems to a lack of state money, due to an expected $3.6-billion shortfall in 
the state budget next year. Officials also blame a declining student enrollment 
and an 8% salary increase for teachers this year for contributing to the 
district's financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the district's 800 teachers and their union representatives, however, 
have accused Duncan and other district administrators of failing to adequately 
plan ahead to avoid major cuts. They have said it is unfair to blame the 
teachers' salary increase for the budget problems when Duncan and other 
district administrators are among the highest paid school officials in Ventura 
and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Davenport, president of the Simi Valley Educators Assn., and several other 
top-level union officials are attending an out-of-state educators conference 
this week and could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Beebe said district officials will talk to several consulting groups to assist 
them in their search for a new superintendent. She said if a new administrator 
is not in place by September, an acting superintendent would be appointed to 
serve in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
Supt. William Streshly of the San Ramon Valley Unified School District said his 
district is slightly smaller than the Simi Valley system, with 16,000 students 
and 23 campuses, but that it is growing fast. Streshly said he is leaving the 
district to take a teaching position at San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
San Ramon Unified has had its share of problems this year. Streshly said the 
district's 800 teachers participated in three wildcat strikes over a two-week 
period in April and May during union contract negotiations. He said the 
teachers had been demanding a 7% salary increase for next year but finally had 
to settle for a 3.5% raise.

COST ESTIMATE FOR AMBULANCE STATION JUMPS TO $870,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The cost estimate of establishing an ambulance station in Moorpark has jumped 
to $870,000 -- $370,000 more than when the idea was introduced by two City 
Council members three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the council and the city's voters, financing an ambulance 
station within city limits would cost homeowners an additional $80 a year in 
property taxes, up from the original estimate of $44 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The escalating cost estimate intensifies the debate over the proposal to open 
an ambulance station in the city as a way to speed up emergency medical 
response. The proposal is to place a measure on the November ballot that would 
give the city the power to collect taxes for such a service. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, City Council members Eloise A. Brown and Clint Harper proposed a 
city-run ambulance station after complaining that emergency medical crews 
dispatched from a station located outside city boundaries are too slow in 
reaching injured and sick patients in Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
The council members said they would like to trim average response times for 
ambulances to less than five minutes by establishing a station closer to the 
center of the city. At the time, they estimated the cost at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, the council on a 3-1 vote gave preliminary approval to putting 
the issue on the November ballot. It also authorized an ambulance service 
budget of up to $870,000 to start the new facility. 
</P>
<P>
"It's almost doubled in a matter of three weeks," said Councilman Paul W. 
Lawrason Jr., who cast the lone opposing vote. He noted that, if approved, the 
proposal would be the highest assessment for a special service in the city. "We 
should have looked in real detail as to the costs." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bernardo Perez joined Harper and Brown in voting for the ballot measure. 
Councilman Scott Montgomery was absent. 
</P>
<P>
Harper said the higher cost estimate is based on an assumption that the city 
will establish a completely independent system with no help from the county's 
Emergency Medical Services Agency, which manages ambulance services throughout 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
Officials would essentially have to start from scratch, hiring paramedics and 
dispatchers and buying ambulances and medical equipment, Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
If the county agency or the private ambulance operator agrees to provide a 
station in Moorpark, the cost of the new station may be much lower, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Harper said he believes there is considerable public support for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think $80 a year is a lot of money when we're talking about a basic 
service that saves lives," Harper said. "We're quite convinced that we can come 
out with figures that will be considerably different than these numbers." 
</P>
<P>
But county officials say the city would pay more for establishing its own 
station than if it allowed the county to provide the service through the 
county's contractor, Pruner Ambulance Co. of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Brodfuehrer, administrator of the county Emergency Medical Services 
Agency, said that allowing Pruner to open a station in Moorpark would cost 
between $250,000 and $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Brodfuehrer said Moorpark's estimated cost of providing essentially the same 
ambulance service "sounds a little high." 
</P>
<P>
The council is expected to hold a public hearing Aug. 1 to review the measure 
and vote on whether the idea should be placed on the November ballot.

THE A-TEAM; 
</P>
<P>
AVOCADOS: GROWERS AND PACKERS ARE TEAMING TO CATCH RUSTLERS, WHO WILL STEAL UP 
TO 10% OF THE CROP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Driven by a growing number of thefts, avocado growers have mobilized into 
Ventura County's first agricultural crime-fighting force. 
</P>
<P>
They could be called the A-Team, a special strike force of growers and packers 
helping the county Sheriff's Department round up criminals and put them behind 
bars. 
</P>
<P>
Growers have become much more serious about avocado thefts, said Bob Tobias, an 
avocado grower and an organizer of the task force that includes about 10 
growers and advisers from the Sheriff's Department and the district attorney's 
office. "The main reason is because thefts are up." 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County-based California Avocado Commission, which promotes avocado 
sales, estimates that avocado rustlers probably will steal from 5% to 10% of 
the state's $200-million harvest this year. 
</P>
<P>
Avocados are big business in Ventura County -- its sixth-largest crop. The 
county's 750 growers who till 16,000 acres of avocado groves countywide brought 
in a $55-million harvest last year. 
</P>
<P>
And authorities estimate the county's loss from rustlers at between $1 million 
and $2.75 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
However, the agricultural task force puts Ventura "way ahead of the game," said 
Avi Crane, spokesman for the avocado commission. Because of its tough stance 
against crime and its organized system of growers and packers, the county was 
awarded $77,000 this year by the commission to fight the rustlers, the 
second-largest grant to a county in the state, Crane said. 
</P>
<P>
From now until the end of summer, task force members will don their 
crime-fighting hats. Instead of guns, they will carry cameras and cellular 
phones as they patrol groves day and night. 
</P>
<P>
"In Ventura County, we are sending a message out there that, if you get caught, 
you're going to jail," Tobias said. 
</P>
<P>
Until the task force was kicked off, growers had relied on sheriff's deputies 
to bring thieves to justice. 
</P>
<P>
Now the task force advises sheriff's investigators on areas vulnerable to 
avocado thieves. It also points out evidence that might have been missed by 
investigators before, confirms the value of stolen fruit and compiles data on 
avocado thefts. 
</P>
<P>
Later this summer, growers say they will help the Sheriff's Department with 
surveillance operations and the first sting operation to trap thieves who 
peddle stolen fruit. 
</P>
<P>
The sting operation will consist of a mock produce stand, staffed by deputies 
who will lure thieves into unloading the fruit they steal. 
</P>
<P>
This year, avocados are especially valuable because of smaller crops. Frost and 
wind damage destroyed much of this year's harvest. Consequently, the price of a 
single avocado is $1.50 at some stores. 
</P>
<P>
Thieves have not failed to notice this, authorities say. An estimated 200,000 
pounds of avocados will be stolen this year in the state, double the amount 
pilfered last year, avocado commission officials predict. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, there have been 19 reported thefts of between 200 and 2,500 
pounds of avocados so far this year, three of them last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's Cmdr. Merwyn Dowd, who advises the avocado task force, said aid from 
the task force has been vital. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the task force's efforts in getting the word out to local farmers, 
growers and their workers are more likely to notice missing fruit, parked cars 
and unusual tire tracks and footprints. In one case, an observant foreman 
reported a theft in progress, he said. Two people were later arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Law-enforcement investigators have been aided by the task force's insight as 
well, Dowd said. Because of the task force, sheriff's deputies now -- in 
addition to analyzing footprints and tire tracks -- look for avocado leaves in 
the cars of suspects and check under suspects' fingernails for avocado residue, 
Dowd said. 
</P>
<P>
The task force's evidence has helped prosecutors convict more avocado rustlers 
and win stiffer sentences, authorities said. So far this year, about 30 avocado 
rustlers have been convicted of grand theft, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. 
McGee. The stiffest sentence any rustler has received in Ventura County is 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases in other counties, theft of avocados is prosecuted as a 
misdemeanor, authorities said.

NEW SUSPICIONS PROMPT PROBE OF WOMAN'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The death of a 75-year-old Oceanside woman last week, first believed to be the 
result of a car accident while she was driving toward Borrego Springs, now is 
being investigated as a possible homicide, the San Diego County Sheriff's 
Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. John Tenwolde, who heads the sheriff's homicide unit, said that, based on 
the injuries sustained by Grace Burrus, "we're not satisfied it's a traffic 
fatality, and we are investigating the possibility she was the victim of foul 
play." 
</P>
<P>
Burrus was en route to Salton City in Imperial County on June 27 but never 
arrived, prompting her estranged husband, John Burrus, to file a 
missing-persons report with the Oceanside Police Department, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Her body was found at 10:30 the following morning by the California Highway 
Patrol, 75 feet below a turnout on county highway S-22 as the road winds down 
the Montezuma Grade toward Borrego Springs. Her car was found 290 feet below 
the roadway, said CHP Officer Mona DeMello-Hoss. 
</P>
<P>
She said Burrus' vehicle did not appear to be traveling fast, and that Burrus, 
who was not restrained by seat belts, was apparently ejected from the vehicle 
as it fell down the steep hillside. 
</P>
<P>
There were no witnesses to the incident, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've put our own investigation on hold, because we know there are other 
investigations going on into her death," DeMello-Hoss said. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County Medical Examiner's Office initially said Burrus had died 
of "blunt-force head injuries," but Deputy Coroner Ken Bell said Friday the 
investigation into her death was continuing and that the source of the blunt 
force was undetermined. 
</P>
<P>
The 
</P>
<P>
medical examiner's office notified the Oceanside Police Department of its 
findings, and that department in turn notified the sheriff's homicide unit, 
Tenwolde said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was trauma to the body, but the nature of the injuries she sustained are 
suspicious in nature and not necessarily consistent with injuries you might 
expect from a traffic accident," Tenwolde said. "The nature of her injuries 
piqued our interest, along with other items of physical evidence that I won't 
define, relevant to the condition of the vehicle and items within the vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
He would not give details. 
</P>
<P>
Tenwolde said Burrus' clothes were "rumpled, and not entirely covering her 
body, but she had not been disrobed, per se. The way she was wearing her 
clothing at the time could have been the result of ejection from the vehicle, 
or may have been due to other reasons. We don't know yet." 
</P>
<P>
There was no evidence she had been sexually assaulted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Her vehicle left the pavement at a "slow rate of speed" at a point along the 
highway popular among motorists for pulling over and viewing the panorama of 
the desert to the east, Tenwolde said. 
</P>
<P>
Grace and John Burrus had been married 30 years, but she filed for divorce from 
him in 1987, according to court records. The couple were scheduled to be in 
Vista Superior Court on Friday for a trial on the dissolution, including the 
division of the couple's real estate holdings and other assets. 
</P>
<P>
John Burrus could not be reached for comment Friday, and was said by a neighbor 
where he lives at Salton City to be on his way to Alaska, where he owns 
property.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 FIRMS JOIN FORCES TO BUILD HOTEL IN 
MALIBU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Adamson Cos. has announced it will join forces with the firm that owns the 
Hotel Bel-Air to develop and manage a luxury hotel the company has long wanted 
to build overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Hotel Bel-Air, which it purchased recently, the Sazale Corp., a 
Japanese firm, operates several luxury hotels in the United States and France, 
including the Los Angeles Biltmore. 
</P>
<P>
Adamson officials said they hope to start soon on the proposed 300-room, 
$65-million hotel on 27 acres near Pepperdine University. However, the 
California Coastal Commission has stipulated that a regional sewer system must 
be in place in Malibu before the hotel can be built. Slow-growth advocates are 
opposed to the sewer.

WOMAN SUFFERS SERIOUS BURNS IN FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 54-year-old woman was in serious condition at UC San Diego Medical Center 
after a fire destroyed her apartment in Cardiff early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two Encinitas firefighters who responded to the blaze have recovered 
after succumbing to malathion fumes in the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which occurred in the 1300 block of Greenlake Drive at 1:25 a.m., 
spewed flames that were "already coming out the door and windows" when 
firefighters arrived, said firefighters' spokesman Steve Marvin. 
</P>
<P>
Phoebe Asher, who reportedly had been sleeping on her couch, was airlifted by 
Life Flight to the hospital. The fire, which Marvin said was caused by 
"discarded smoking materials," caused $80,000 in damage. 
</P>
<P>
As firefighters investigated the blaze, two fell ill and were taken to Scripps 
Memorial Hospital in Encinitas, where they were treated and released. After 
calling the county hazardous materials unit, two broken one-pint bottles of 
malathion were found. 
</P>
<P>
Nursing Supervisor Tom Banaszak said Asher suffered burns over 34% of her body. 
"In addition to the burns on her arms, she sustained inhalation burns," 
Banaszak said.

CREATOR OF HOMEMADE CANCER TREATMENT DIES; 
</P>
<P>
 MESSIAH OR QUACK?: THOUGH HER METHODS WERE ROUTINELY DISMISSED AS QUACKERY BY 
THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT, EMBATTLED PHYSICIAN VIRGINIA C. LIVINGSTON FOUGHT TO 
TREAT CANCER WITH A REGIMEN OF "VACCINES" DERIVED FROM A PATIENT'S URINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA ROACH MONROE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Controversial physician Virginia C. Livingston has died at age 83, leaving 
behind a San Diego clinic that continues to advocate her methods of using 
homemade "vaccine," antibiotics, enemas and megadoses of vitamins to treat 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Livingston died of heart failure in Athens while on a visit to Greece with her 
daughter, Julie Anne Wagner of St. Helena, Calif., a spokesman for the clinic 
in San Diego said. 
</P>
<P>
The pair had left for Europe June 11, after Livingston attended the 60th 
reunion of her 1930 graduating class at Vassar College. 
</P>
<P>
Livingston's death came five months after her Livingston Medical Center in 
Point Loma was ordered by the state to stop using "autogenous vaccines" to 
treat cancer patients. These extracts of bacteria, derived from a patient's 
urine, were thought by Livingston to boost the immune system and fight cancer. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic's treatments are based on her longtime premise -- never proven to 
the vast majority of researchers -- that cancer is caused by a hormone secreted 
by a certain bacterium. The American Cancer Society issued a report earlier 
this year that said imprecise and sloppy methods were believed to have led her 
to mislabel a common staphylococcus strain a cancer microbe. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the Livingston treatments use antibiotics and a vaccine 
against tuberculosis to attack the bacteria; enemas and dietary supplements to 
limit it in the intestinal tract; and a chicken-free and egg-free diet because 
Livingston thought the bacteria flourished in poultry. 
</P>
<P>
Although her methods are routinely dismissed as quackery by the medical 
establishment, physicians and cancer researchers in San Diego declined to be 
interviewed about Livingston. 
</P>
<P>
A staff member at UCLA's Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center who served for two 
decades on the state's cancer advisory board said she concluded that Livingston 
was sincere but nonetheless a charlatan. 
</P>
<P>
"Where her power was with individuals was that she explained things in this 
very simple manner: 'You have a bug, and we can give you an antibody to that 
bug,' " said Helene Brown, a health educator at the UCLA cancer center. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a theory that ever held water, but it certainly simplifies a complex 
disease, and that's what people want, a simple explanation," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Elegant and vigorous into her 80s, Livingston brought an intensity to her 
mission that made her believable, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
"In my conversations with her, she led me to believe that she really thought 
she was a messiah in this business," Brown said. "I don't think she was in it 
solely for the money. I think she really believed that she was the messiah and 
she was going to find the cancer cure." 
</P>
<P>
Brown also has an analysis of how this messianic belief in herself originated. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a woman who became an M.D. long before many women even had that 
opportunity. So she was quite accomplished in just having gone to medical 
school and having become a female doctor," she said. "I think that's what 
tripped her up. She was one of a kind, and she eventually grasped the idea that 
she was different and better, and that whatever she would do would be a 
success." 
</P>
<P>
Born Virginia Wuerthele in Meadville, Pa., on Dec. 28, 1906, Livingston 
attended Vassar College and received her medical degree in 1936 from Bellevue 
Medical School in New York. Both her father and grandfather had been 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
Livingston took jobs as an examining physician, and, in 1949, became a 
professor of biology at Rutgers University in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
It was after the death of her first husband, Dr. Joseph Caspe, that she moved 
to the San Diego area in 1955 and became a staff physician with the San Diego 
Health Assn. 
</P>
<P>
She and her second husband, Dr. A.M. Livingston, established the Livingston 
Medical Clinic in San Diego in 1969. After he died, she married a former cancer 
patient, Dr. Owen Wheeler, and renamed the clinic the Livingston-Wheeler 
Clinic. Her third husband died in 1988, and, within the last few months, the 
clinic was renamed the Livingston Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman for the clinic, it was in 1971 that Livingston began 
dedicating the clinic's work totally to the research and treatment of cancer 
based on her bacterial theory of how cancer grew. 
</P>
<P>
Her practice over the years resulted in several complaints against her, said 
state health department investigator Daniel Walsh. Some were referred to the 
Board of Medical Quality Assurance, he said, but that agency has no record of 
any complaints having been pursued. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government ruled in 1986 that the clinic was ineligible for 
Medicare funding. A peer review conducted as part of the investigation found 
several "serious deficiencies" in clinic operations, according to the American 
Cancer Society. These included poor record-keeping; inadequate medical exams 
and lab tests; lack of follow-up on medical complications and lack of informed 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, Walsh has led a continuing investigation into whether the clinic 
violates a state ban on use of unproven cancer treatments. It was this inquiry 
that led Health Director Kenneth W. Kizer to issue a "cease-and-desist" order 
against the autogenous vaccines in February. 
</P>
<P>
Livingston's lawyers are contesting the order and also are seeking state 
approval of formal tests of autogenous vaccines, Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Copeland, assistant manager of the clinic, said the clinic's board of 
directors expects it to continue operation under the guidance of three 
physicians and one psychologist who remain. In the last few years, Copeland 
said, Livingston herself had concentrated on her writing, lectures and lab 
research, rather than patient care. 
</P>
<P>
A resident of Rancho Santa Fe, Livingston is survived by her daughter and by a 
stepson, Dr. Brent Livingston of Rancho Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service will be held at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter-day Saints, 12701 Torrey Bluff Drive. A private interment will 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
The family asks that remembrances be in the form of contributions to the 
Livingston Foundation, 3232 Duke St., San Diego 92110.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CONFERENCE TO INCLUDE SURFERS, DEVELOPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Surfers, environmentalists and others who want to save the waves and beaches 
will meet July 21 at Pepperdine University in Malibu for the GeoSurf Symposium 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
According to organizers Glenn R. Hening and John Van Hamersveld, the conference 
will be the first to bring together all groups that have a vested interest in 
the health of the coastline, from wave riders and makers of wet suits to 
ecologists and developers. 
</P>
<P>
Hening, who founded the Surfrider Foundation, a surfer activist organization, 
and Van Hamersveld, a graphic designer whose work includes the classic poster 
for the surfing film "The Endless Summer," said they hoped the symposium would 
function as a leadership seminar for all those concerned about the future of 
waves and beaches.

COUNTY BOARD TO CONSIDER AIRPORT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLYN KUSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors will consider later this month whether to approve an 
agreement with the Federal Aviation Administration to build a permanent air 
traffic control tower at Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
The permanent tower would replace a 37-foot-high temporary tower erected at the 
airport last year. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which would give the county a 40-year lease on the new control 
tower when it is completed, is necessary because the FAA is providing the $1.5 
million needed to build the six-story structure. The supervisors will consider 
the agreement July 24. 
</P>
<P>
"It's long overdue," said James G. O'Neill, the airport administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The county has been seeking federal money for an air traffic control tower 
since 1982, when the annual number of landings and takeoffs at the county-owned 
airport first exceeded 200,000, O'Neill said. The FAA requires control towers 
at airports where operations exceed that number, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, about 210,000 flights began or ended at the airport, airport 
spokesman Jeff McCaullay said. 
</P>
<P>
If the lease agreement is approved, construction on the permanent tower would 
begin in November, with work ending in May, 1992, McCaullay said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not soon enough," he said. "Getting that brand new tower is like a 
windfall to us." 
</P>
<P>
The airport's three air traffic controllers now work in a cramped room 
supported by two large shipping crates. Controllers sitting in the 
glass-enclosed structure have a full view from three sides and a partial view 
from the fourth side, O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a no-frills tower and was never meant to be permanent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The new tower will include office space, an elevator, restrooms and drinking 
fountains, O'Neill said. Controllers must now walk about 75 yards to the 
nearest restroom facility, he said. CAROLYN KUSKY

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LAWNDALE OUSTS 2ND CITY MANAGER IN 2 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lawndale City Manager James Arnold, who faces criminal misdemeanor charges in 
the demolition of three city buildings that contained asbestos, was ousted this 
week by a three-member majority of the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold is the second city manager to be fired by the council within two years. 
</P>
<P>
He described the agreement as amicable and said he has no hard feelings about 
the council's decision. "The city's been good to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Councilman William Johnson: "We just feel the city of Lawndale has been 
through a lot of problems and turmoil in the past, and we feel a change is 
needed." Council members who supported the ouster said the asbestos case was a 
factor but problems with the city's budget were a larger concern.

TEEN-AGER ADMITS ABANDONING INFANT 
</P>

A National City woman came forward Friday to say she is the mother of a newborn 
baby found rolled in a blanket beside a National City Pizza Hut on June 29. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Lynn Huggins, 18, an employee of the Pizza Hut, was booked into County 
Jail at Las Colinas on charges of felony child abuse and felony child 
endangerment Friday afternoon. She had turned herself in at the National City 
police station at 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she was unable to cope with the child and had not told anyone of the 
pregnancy," said Olivia Castellanos, a National City police dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, her mother, who had noticed a sudden weight loss by her 
daughter and had read about the case, confronted her Friday and persuaded her 
to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
The case of "Baby Girl Doe," as the authorities had dubbed her, had drawn the 
attention of the area news media last week. Earlier Friday, the county 
Department of Social Services had held a press conference displaying the baby, 
in hopes of finding her mother. 
</P>
<P>
Huggins gave birth at home, apparently without assistance, authorities said. An 
hour later, at 4:30 p.m., the baby was found outside the Pizza Hut restaurant 
in the 2000 block of Highland Avenue, where Huggins worked, said National City 
Police Sgt. Carey Sullivan. The police had had no luck finding the mother, said 
Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
Although slightly dehydrated when found, the baby is healthy and eating well, 
said Heidi Staples, the county social worker supervising the case. The infant 
has been living with foster parents for the past week. 
</P>
<P>
The baby's case is now in juvenile court, which will probably take a year to 
decide who gets custody of the girl, said Carol Baenziger, a Department of 
Social Services spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes people panic when birth comes. They don't know what to do, and they 
just drop the baby and leave," said Raymond Fellers, deputy director of the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan said National City has had two or three similar cases lately, and the 
parents of those children were located within a week or two.

JUDGE RULES PARAMOUNT RANCH APPROVAL LEGAL; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: OPPONENTS WHO HAD SAID THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT FOR THE 
PROJECT WAS INADEQUATE ARE DEFEATED. THEIR ATTORNEYS PLAN TO APPEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Superior Court judge ruled Friday that Los Angeles County acted legally in 
approving the Paramount Ranch development in Agoura, handing a stinging defeat 
to opponents who claimed the controversial luxury house development did not get 
an adequate environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ruling by Judge David P. Yaffe, construction could start soon on the 
scenic, oak-studded parcel where the Renaissance Pleasure Faire formerly was 
held. State and federal parks agencies had tried to buy the 320-acre site for 
inclusion in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for opponents of the project said they would appeal the decision, and 
it was uncertain whether the developers would begin work with the case under 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Ezra Raiten, head of Paramount Ranch Estates, owner of the site, would not 
comment on the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Yaffe ruled on two suits filed last year after the Board of Supervisors 
approved the 150-house development. The Sierra Club, the Las Virgenes 
Homeowners Federation and Friends of the Santa Monica Mountains contended that 
the county violated state law by rubber-stamping the environmental impact 
report prepared by the developers' consultants instead of doing their own 
report or carefully checking the developers' conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the county acknowledged that the Paramount Ranch developers hired 
the consultants to do the report, but said county planners monitored their work 
at every step. 
</P>
<P>
Yaffe ruled inadmissible some evidence purporting to show that the county had 
been misled about the identity of the project's owners and by a financial 
analysis presented by the developer. 
</P>
<P>
Darlene F. Phillips, a private attorney representing the county, called the 
ruling "a substantial victory for the county, certainly upholding the process 
and . . . the good work that was done in this case by the county staff." 
</P>
<P>
Carl H. Moor, one of the plaintiffs' attorneys, said the ruling "rewards the 
county for falling asleep, and it says to everyone who's applying for a 
development project, 'Go ahead and lie to us about the environmental impacts, 
and as long as we wake up just long enough to glance at the pieces of paper 
you've given us, we've complied.' " 
</P>
<P>
The case will be appealed and "we'll win," Moor said. "I guarantee it." 
</P>
<P>
The suits involved the county's practice of letting developers choose and 
direct consultants who prepare environmental impact reports for their projects. 
Many cities and counties hire report consultants themselves to guard against 
bias. But under state law, a planning agency may leave the developer in charge, 
as long as it verifies that the report is objective and thorough. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, Phillips told the judge, there are "literally hundreds of pages 
in the record that show independent review" by the county. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs said evidence they obtained through depositions and internal 
documents in the pretrial discovery process showed that the developers 
concealed key information from the county. 
</P>
<P>
They cited the repeated insistence of Brian Heller, a Paramount Ranch partner, 
that he would not negotiate with parks agencies because he was determined to 
develop the land. "I am not a willing seller," Heller told the supervisors at a 
crowded public hearing Dec. 15, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The next day, however, Raiten's firm completed purchase of the land for $13.5 
million -- a sale that had been agreed on months earlier, unknown to the 
county. Heller continued to pose as owner of the project until after 
supervisors approved it. But according to discovery documents, he was actually 
a part-time consultant to Raiten at a fee of $6,500 per month. 
</P>
<P>
Other evidence concerned a financial analysis purporting to show that the 
project would not be feasible unless the developers could build all the homes 
they requested. 
</P>
<P>
The County General Plan allowed a maximum of 103 houses on the site. 
Supervisors were under pressure from park advocates, including members of 
Southern California's congressional delegation, to hold the line at 103 houses 
so the land would not be priced beyond the park agencies' reach. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to show that he could not develop the project under the existing 
zoning, Heller hired a consultant to analyze the feasibility of alternative 
project designs. He had the consulting firm base its calculations on a land 
investment cost of $14 million -- approximately what Raiten was about to pay. 
When the calculations showed that an array of designs would be profitable, 
Heller had the consultant redo the study using a land investment cost of $17.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The county never saw the first calculations, which did not emerge until this 
year in pretrial discovery. The second version, described as a "sophisticated 
financial study," was submitted by Heller to the county at the Dec. 15 hearing. 
It was included in the environmental report as part of the justification for 
"upzoning" the property from 103 to 150 houses. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for Raiten and the county said this evidence should be excluded because 
the court should consider only the information that was before the county when 
it rendered its decisions. 
</P>
<P>
As part of his ruling Friday, Yaffe excluded the evidence, although he 
acknowledged that he had not fully reviewed it. He said he would not consider 
the discovery material because the plaintiffs had not properly organized it. 
</P>
<P>
"You've given me some sort of treasure hunt that I'm supposed to embark on," 
Yaffe said. 
</P>
<P>
During oral arguments, the validity of the financial analysis was discussed, 
but it was never explained why the first calculation was not shared with the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers said the property's value exceeded $17.5 million, so use of 
that figure made the study more accurate. Lawyers for the plaintiffs pointed 
out that the study identified the $17.5 million as the land's cost -- not its 
market value. 
</P>
<P>
Yaffe called the issue "a technicality and not a matter of substance." 
</P>
<P>
Yaffe found one defect in the report: Its omission of a January, 1989, memo 
from Heller to the county discussing the financial study. The judge ordered the 
county to add the memo to the report, a formal process that could take a few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
That will "clean up this matter and make this environmental impact report 
square with the law," Yaffe said.

PALMDALE TO CONSIDER OUTLAWING FIREWORKS; 
</P>
<P>
FIRE FEARS: THE MAYOR PREDICTS THAT UNLIKE AN EARLIER ATTEMPT, A BAN ON SALES 
WILL BECOME LAW WITHIN SEVERAL MONTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Fear of brush-fire disasters has spurred the Antelope Valley city of Palmdale, 
last holdout for legal fireworks sales in northern Los Angeles County, to again 
consider outlawing them. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale Mayor William "Pete" Knight said Friday that he has asked city staff 
members to draft a fireworks ban for the City Council to consider, predicting a 
law will be adopted within several months despite the failure of a similar city 
move two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never gotten the public input and support for it like we did this year," 
the mayor said, crediting the sense of fire danger created by a fourth year of 
drought that has left the area tinder-dry, and concern over a recent rash of 
arson brush fires in nearby areas. 
</P>
<P>
The city's move, disclosed just two days after the traditional Fourth of July 
celebration, sets the stage for a battle between county fire officials and 
anti-fireworks residents, and many local service organizations that rely on 
fireworks sales to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
"Great. That's wonderful. I'm encouraged," said Jim Daleo, an assistant county 
fire chief, when told of Palmdale's proposal. "I see a trend of cities slowly 
getting out of the fireworks business. I think the benefits of outlawing them 
outweigh the advantages of keeping them." 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, cities may choose to allow the sale of certain fireworks, 
referred to as "safe and sane." But fire officials say even those are unsafe, 
and a growing number of cities have outlawed them in recent years. Fireworks 
sales are now banned in 47 cities in Los Angeles County and permitted in 39. 
</P>
<P>
But Jim Hull, recording secretary for the Palmdale Knights of Columbus, said 
his group and other organizations in Palmdale likely will protest the proposed 
ban. The Palmdale Knights of Columbus have been selling Fourth of July 
fireworks from the same site for about 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it comes down to the bottom line that safe and sane is safe and sane," 
Hull said, blaming safety and fire problems more on fireworks such as bottle 
rockets that are illegal in California. The Knights depend on fireworks sales 
to raise money for their scholarship programs, Hull said. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale became the north county's last legal fireworks outlet when the city of 
San Fernando, under pressure from the city of Los Angeles, banned them in 1988. 
Other cities with fireworks bans include Lancaster, Burbank, Glendale, Los 
Angeles, Hidden Hills, Santa Clarita and Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
On the Fourth of July this year, county fire officials, who serve 48 cities and 
all unincorporated areas, blamed fireworks for 119 fires, with damage estimated 
at $485,000, and eight injuries. Of those fires, 33 involved houses or other 
structures, 52 involved other property, and 34 were in brush.

KAY WILSON WON'T RUN FOR REELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Citing a desire to return to volunteer work, Santa Paula Mayor Kay Wilson has 
announced she will not seek reelection to a second four-year term on the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, a local real estate agent, also said she once made a promise to herself 
not to return to public office after her term ends. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's necessary to get new blood on the council," she said. "I liked 
what my new energy brought to the council 4 1/2 years ago, and I want to make 
room for somebody else to do the same." 
</P>
<P>
Before announcing her decision Friday not to pursue a second term, Wilson said 
she talked to several potential candidates whom she might consider supporting, 
but declined to identify them. 
</P>
<P>
Two people have already announced their candidacy for three seats on the 
council. John Melton, a 16-year veteran of the council, said he will run. 
Robert Berrego, an aide to state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) and a 
member of the Planning Commission, has also said he will seek a seat. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Carl Barringer, who has served for eight years, has said he is still 
unsure of his plans. 
</P>
<P>
The filing period for the three races begins July 16 and ends Aug. 10, Deputy 
City Clerk Liz Ruiz said. Incumbents have until Aug. 15 to file, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who was appointed last April to a one-year term as mayor, said she 
dislikes the political maneuvering that often takes place in government. She 
said she wants to leave public office before becoming tempted to make decisions 
simply to please the largest number of constituents. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like politicians who hold public office and vote in manners that make 
sure they are reelected the next time around," said Wilson, who cited a pending 
council vote on whether to retain an ordinance that limits rent increases at 
mobile home parks when mobile homes are sold. 
</P>
<P>
Although a vote on the matter has not yet been scheduled, Wilson said she might 
be tempted to keep the ordinance if she remained a council member, to ensure 
support from mobile home residents. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was running for reelection I might be tempted to vote for the interests 
of one group of people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has rejoined the board of the Boys and Girls Club and said she plans to 
become more active in her church, the United Way and the Musical Arts Council. 
</P>
<P>
"You name it, and Kay Wilson will probably be ready to help," she said. CAROLYN

4-HOUR SIEGE ENDS WITH MURDER SUSPECT'S ARREST 
</P>

<P>
A man sought by Escondido police on suspicion of murder was arrested Thursday 
night in Covina after a four-hour siege involving a special weapons and tactics 
squad from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
It took Escondido homicide Detective Hal Espy more than 2 1/2 months to locate 
Mario Martinez Preza, and it took 20 members of the SWAT team to bring him out 
of an apartment at 10:30 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Preza, 34, who counts Highland Street in San Diego as one of his addresses, was 
booked into the Vista jail on a murder charge and two counts of attempted 
murder, after being arrested in Covina, which is about 20 miles east of 
downtown Los Angeles, said Escondido police Sgt. Dan Starr. 
</P>
<P>
He is charged with the shooting death of John Albert Duvall, 35, who owned 
Duvall Janitorial Service, and with the attempted murder of two others who were 
at the slaying scene. 
</P>

Duvall was shot at his residence in the 300 block of West 10th Avenue in 
Escondido on April 18. Duvall had taken over his father's business. "His dad 
had a respectable business for many, many years here," Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, Duvall was shot because of an argument about a drug debt 
to Preza. Starr said Preza claimed he was owed $700, while Duvall maintained 
that the proper amount was $400. Starr said Preza was "a supplier of drugs" who 
dealt mainly in marijuana and methamphetamine. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses to the slaying identified Preza, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Preza moved around a lot. "Staying in one place for very 
long is not part of his lifestyle," said Starr, who added that Preza has had 
several addresses in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday afternoon, Espy and police officers from Escondido, Covina, and 
West Covina converged on an apartment complex in the 100 block of Vecino 
Street. After Preza refused to communicate with the officers, who threw a phone 
in to him, police called in the 20-member SWAT team, which apprehended him 
without trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Preza's son was put in the care of an uncle who lives nearby.

AROUND THE VALLEY / SEBASTIAN ROTELLA : COWHANDS TEACH KIDS THE ROPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sebastian Rotella 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Myron Marzett squinted into a punishing desert sun beyond the makeshift corral, 
a wooden fence enclosing the batting cage in Jackie Robinson Park. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-year-old Marzett, who ropes steers professionally for the Bill Pickett 
Invitational Rodeo, looked lean and serious under his cowboy hat. 
</P>
<P>
An entourage of diminutive apprentice cowhands, until recently mere kids 
playing in the park, hurried behind him as he walked. 
</P>
<P>
"What's in the bag?" asked a boy with close-cut hair and baggy shorts. 
</P>
<P>
"Ropes," Marzett said. 
</P>
<P>
"Are you gonna rope the calf?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yep." 
</P>
<P>
Marzett was the youngest of six members of the Denver-based Bill Pickett Rodeo 
who visited the county park last week in Sun Village, a black enclave in the 
eastern Antelope Valley since the 1940s. They had two goals: entertainment and 
education. 
</P>
<P>
The touring rodeo group represents part of an ongoing effort to retrieve the 
historical role of black cowboys from the margins of history books and the 
shadows of Hollywood sets. Cowboys such as turn-of-the century rodeo star Bill 
Pickett, whose technique for subduing steers involved chomping down on the 
animal's lip with his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about rough and tough. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the cultural message, the rodeo presentations aim to inspire young 
people with a taste of the discipline and sweat that are part of being an 
American archetype. 
</P>
<P>
"We were cowboys before we were basketball players," said actor Glynn Turman, 
this year's grand marshal of the rodeo. "It's a whole neglected part of 
history." 
</P>
<P>
Turman starred as a Chicago high school kid in the 1975 movie "Cooley High" and 
plays "The Colonel" on the TV show "A Different World." But he's no celluloid 
cowboy. He raises real horses at his ranch near Lake Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
The young audience at Jackie Robinson Park warmed slowly to the show. They 
fidgeted during a discussion of barrel racing. They were reticent about taking 
part in a demonstration with nylon rope lassos by Turman, and Phillip and Chuck 
Banks, two earnest and massive brothers who learned their horse science on a 
family ranch in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
But when Marzett climbed into the corral with a hot-and-bothered-looking calf, 
lasso at the ready, 25 small children crowded against the rickety fence. Dani 
Stephens, 16, and a handful of teen-age friends in white T-shirts, black pants 
or cutoffs hung back, looking elaborately unexcited. 
</P>
<P>
Marzett hit the mark, but the calf slipped free. Marzett prepared another toss; 
the kids surged forward; the calf bolted suddenly and burst through the fence, 
accompanied by the crack of splintering wood, shouts and laughter. Now there 
was a runaway calf making speed across the park toward the open desert. And 
suddenly the place was filled with cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody grab a rope!" Turman shouted. 
</P>
<P>
Spectators Jesse Saldano and Terrel Weatherspoon were way ahead of him, giving 
hot pursuit on short legs with lassos held high. 
</P>
<P>
Dani Stephens and his fellow teen-agers sprinted with sudden vigor to the end 
of a chain-link fence, where they adroitly cut their quarry off at the pass, so 
to speak, and sent the calf back toward Turman. 
</P>
<P>
The grand marshal lived up to his billing with a lunging lasso toss. But the 
calf yanked the rope clean out of his hands and headed back into the crowd. It 
was finally subdued by Stephens and a numerous supporting cast, who animatedly 
described their roles in the capture while small hands reached out to touch the 
prone, quivering animal. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was going to be slow because of the size of him," Saldano said 
breathlessly. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost got him," said Tom Richter, 12. 
</P>
<P>
Turman grinned at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the best thing that could have happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody feigned boredom as a bull-riding demonstration wrapped up the morning, 
with a barrel standing in for the bull. Chuck Banks laid out and explained his 
accouterments with the care of a craftsman: the glove that shields the hand 
roped to the bull, the spurs, the rosin. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Robert Saxton, 6, laconically summed up his impressions of the show: 
</P>
<P>
"Cool." 
</P>
<P>
Phillip and Chuck Banks talked at lunch about the importance of passing on 
their lifestyle, which their grandparents brought to California when they 
migrated from Texas and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Banks, whose bull rider's gait was exaggerated by two broken bones in his 
left leg, the souvenir of a recent bout with a 2,000-pound bull, likes to 
challenge street kids who think they are tough. 
</P>
<P>
"I say, 'Let's see how tough you are; let's see you ride this bull,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Banks wants kids to understand that Western tradition was built by a 
legion of cowboys who were not portrayed by John Wayne: Blacks, Mexicans, 
American Indians, Basques. 
</P>
<P>
"They talked a mixture of Spanish, Indian languages and black slave talk," he 
said. "You have to hunt that information down. . . . The old people are dying 
out. The stories are going untold." 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Banks trains and raises horses when he isn't on the bronco-busting 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
His dream is to have a ranch where kids could learn about horsemanship -- about 
danger, skill and hard work. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a challenge. Every morning I have to go out and feed horses, shovel 
manure. You have to haul hay and grain, understand and take care of equipment. 
It's more than just putting on a hat and pair of jeans."

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DRIVER DIES AFTER HE WAS SHOT NEAR FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A motorist who was shot in the head while driving onto a freeway ramp in 
Sherman Oaks has died, Los Angeles police said Friday. There are no suspects in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
Juan Manrique, 18, of Arleta died Thursday afternoon at the Medical Center of 
North Hollywood, a day after the shooting at the intersection of Woodman Avenue 
and the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Manrique and a friend were about to turn onto the westbound on-ramp 
to the freeway when a car sped by them on Woodman and several shots were fired. 
Manrique was struck once in the head. His passenger, whose identity was not 
released, was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the motive for the shooting was not known but believe it could be 
gang-related because Manrique reportedly associated with gang members.

TAX INCREASE: DEBATE OVER WHO WILL PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever since Bush said the "T" word, the poor, the elderly, and especially the 
middle-class have started bracing themselves for another heavy hit they expect 
on their taxes and benefits. Here are a few of the ways to even the burden: 
</P>
<P>
1. 
</P>
<P>
Roll back the pay raise for congressmen recently implemented. Rescind the pay 
raise for senators which is scheduled to kick in after the elections. 
</P>
<P>
2. Close the tax loophole where the more affluent citizens can write off yachts 
and expensive motor homes as second home. That should not be too hard to do. 
</P>
<P>
3. Do not cut the capital gains tax. The government will have an extremely hard 
sell to convince the elderly couple, living from Social Security check to 
Social Security, of the fairness of such a tax cut, especially if they are 
asked to take a cut on cost of living adjustments. How can cutting taxes 
increase revenues? 
</P>
<P>
There are many other ways to make the load easier. This is everyone's country; 
everyone must carry a fair load!

* NICARAGUA HAS ENOUGH PROBLEMS WITHOUT ORTEGA'S CHEAP SHOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Daniel Ortega was lauded when he stepped aside gracefully after losing 
Nicaragua's presidency to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. But Ortega's grace seems 
to have given way to taking pot shots at Chamorro's fledging effort to restore 
economic health to that weary nation. 
</P>
<P>
About 85,000 Sandinista-allied trade unionists are paralyzing Nicaragua's 
public sector in the second general strike since Ortega ceded power to 
Chamorro. The strikers presented strident demands, unsatisfied even though the 
last walkout netted an 100% wage hike. 
</P>
<P>
Union excesses are justified, according to Ortega, because Chamorro promised 
and failed to bring prosperity to Nicaragua. Things were less moribund during 
his term, Ortega contended, despite a horrific civil war. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, sure. 
</P>
<P>
Ortega's carryings-on smack of sour grapes: Chamorro's government is just nine 
weeks old and the last Contra came in from the mountains only days ago. 
</P>
<P>
The strikes fly in the face of the spirit that carried the elections and 
persuaded the Contra rebels to put down their arms. Chamorro inherited empty 
coffers, an unbelievable inflation rate of 36,300% and dormant agriculture and 
industry. Chamorro, simply stated, faces the quixotic task of multiplying zero. 
</P>
<P>
Even with massive infusions of U.S. aid, it will take the cooperation of all 
Nicaraguans to repair the damage caused by a lifetime of despotism and warfare. 
</P>
<P>
If Ortega is really eager to help, he should promote cross-ideological 
reconciliation. The Sandinistas must step back and let Chamorro heal the wounds 
of conflict.

<P>
It's high time that serious consideration is now being given to raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Those people who would also cut entitlements, however, must think that some of 
us live on another planet! We who receive Social Security or federal annuities 
live here and spend money, too. We would end up paying twice. Not only will our 
tax payments go up but our incomes would go down. To be fair, taxes should be 
raised but entitlements should be left alone.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN WHO KILLED BABY SENTENCED TO 16 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A North Hollywood man who struck and killed a 2-year-old boy suffering from 
Down's syndrome was sentenced Friday to 16 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony Michael Malone pleaded guilty last month to voluntary manslaughter 
after prosecutors agreed to drop a murder charge against him. 
</P>
<P>
He received the maximum sentence for manslaughter -- 11 years -- plus five 
years for a prior burglary conviction, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeffrey S. 
Gootman. 
</P>
<P>
The baby, Jonathan Moreno, died July 27, 1988, after he was struck by Malone, 
police said. The child was the son of Malone's 19-year-old girlfriend, Theresa 
Givens, who was at work when the child died. 
</P>
<P>
Gootman said prosecutors dropped the murder charge because they could not prove 
that Malone intended to kill the boy.

TAX INCREASE: DEBATE OVER WHO WILL PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am disturbed that our President and Congress can only think of increasing 
taxes as the solution to the deficit. They have treated our outrageous foreign 
aid as sacrosanct. 
</P>
<P>
Forty years-plus is long enough to support the world! Our seniors are of the 
generation that fought in World War II, rebuilt the world with their money, 
preserved the peace with their sons and daughters, and now the politicians are 
afraid they are too affluent and need to pay more taxes. None of the American 
people need to pay more taxes. We need relief from giving money away to 
countries which no longer need it and/or countries whose leaders line their 
pockets while their people suffer. 
</P>
<P>
Keep our military strong, utilize the Peace Corps for countries which need help 
and discontinue foreign aid to pay off the deficit. I hope the politicians are 
reading lips when the American people say no tax increase.

TAX INCREASE: DEBATE OVER WHO WILL PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Schneider wrote (Opinion, July 1) that the liberals in Congress are 
concerned about the kind of tax increase likely to be in the budget deal. "Last 
week, 134 House Democrats signed a letter to Foley . . . warning that they 
would not support any agreement with the White House that puts a further burden 
on (middle-income) families rather than the very wealthy." 
</P>
<P>
In the same issue, Robert L. Borosage (Commentary page) wrote that most of us 
are already paying a tax increase. Nine out of every 10 American families now 
pay more in federal taxes than they did before the Republicans took over the 
White House in 1980. Only the richest 10% enjoy a significant tax break. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Kuttner, writing in The Times (Nov. 13) pointed out that so much of our 
red ink comes from under-taxing the rich. Raising taxes of the nation's richest 
1% would raise about $130 billion in the nation's treasury. "Since 1977, before 
the supply-side revolution the top 1% of households had just 9.2% of the 
national income. Since 1977, the annual tax bill paid by the richest 1% has 
declined by about $50 billion a year, while their income, in real terms, has 
gone up by 74%." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't necessary for President Bush to raise taxes. He merely must return our 
income tax structure to 1970 levels when the wealthiest were paying their fair 
share. The trickle-down theory didn't work in the 1920s, and it certainly isn't 
working now.

ANC LEADER NELSON MANDELA'S SOCIALISTIC VIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There have been numerous articles ("Israel Has Right to Exist, Mandela Tells 
U.S. Jews," June 10, "Mandela, Sharansky Agree to Disagree," June 30 and 
letters, June 28) devoted to the concerns of Jewish leaders regarding Mandela's 
association with Arafat, head of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the 
ANC leader's views on Israel. Unfortunately, The Times has focused little 
attention on the opinion of black people. 
</P>
<P>
Many African Americans were disillusioned by the widely publicized Jewish 
discontent with the ANC leader's position on the Middle East. Anxious that 
Mandela's American reception be as favorable as that he was given in Europe and 
Canada, blacks questioned the proprietary of this collateral litmus test. 
</P>
<P>
What is more, African Americans were stupefied by the irony of this 
controversy. After all, it is no secret that Israel and South Africa have been 
co-partners over the past 40 years. Even during periods of global boycotts and 
embargoes, the two nations have unabashedly maintained strong economic, 
military, nuclear, scientific, academic, cultural and athletic ties. 
</P>
<P>
Israel was certainly not the only nation to fortify the apartheid state. 
Nevertheless, in the present context of Jewish complaints against Mandela, 
African Americans are hard-pressed to ignore the fact that when the chips were 
down the PLO supported his struggle but Israel did not. 
</P>
<P>
Many who are now calling for Mandela to denounce his allies were silent while 
Israel supported his foes. Such manifest hypocrisy has not escaped the 
attention of the ANC leader or of millions of other black people around the 
world.

SMOKING BAN IN RESTAURANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'm sitting here reading your editorial wherein proponents of no smoking in Los 
Angeles city restaurants feel that the ban should cover a larger area, 
countywide, maybe statewide. I quote: ". . . People who smoke cigarettes or 
cigars or pipes inflict their dirty addiction on innocents who happen to be 
sharing their airspace." 
</P>
<P>
Airspace, well go figure! It's 100 degrees today, the sky is a putrid shade of 
gray-brown, the "airspace" smells foul, and all they can worry about is smoking 
in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
I am also a nonsmoker; however, self-righteous and pompous I am not. Get real, 
Los Angeles. Stop blaming smokers for the damage Southern California and its 
inhabitants caused to the environment decades ago by sheer, self-centered 
greed.

Mandela spent 27 years in prison for the right to equality.

He came to America seeking support for the abolition of apartheid and is

comparing him to H. Rap Brown and Willie Horton (Part A, June 27). 
</P>
<P>
If Dannemeyer is out for world recognition as a political moron he can now 
retire. Mandela will go down in history standing with the likes of Abraham 
Lincoln and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Dannemeyer will disappear, along with 
his negative contributions to equality.

ANC LEADER NELSON MANDELA'S SOCIALISTIC VIEWS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Edwin Meese III and Bruce Fein misunderstand Nelson Mandela's socialistic views 
("Heroism Is No Ticket to Infallibility," Commentary, June 27). They state that 
an "unchecked majoritarianism is a formula for tyranny over minorities." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela is not calling for an unchecked majority, but a country ruled by 
equals. A true socialist model (not the kind in Eastern Europe), based on the 
concept of all for one and one for all, is structured to eliminate tyranny over 
minorities by a small, elite ruling class. A just society is composed of 
social, political and economic equals who are free to develop their human 
abilities. 
</P>
<P>
Meese and Fein are only partly correct in their statement that "the founders of 
our Constitution went to great lengths to hold majoritarianism in check and to 
protect the rights of minorities." The elite, property-owning class of white 
Founding Fathers did go to great lengths to enhance national power to protect 
their economic interests. Article IV, Section 2 of the Constitution defends 
one's right to own property -- slaves, that is. The founders' goal was not to 
protect the civil liberties of slaves, indentured servants, women and common 
men. Their goal was to maintain their economic power. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela's wish for "one-person, one-vote" and redistribution of wealth from the 
white minority to the black majority echoes socialists' desire for the people 
to rule themselves through equality.

PRESERVING FRYMAN CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sierra Club has suggested that Fryman Canyon be a monument in order to 
preserve this unique piece of the Santa Monica Mountains' natural history, 
which contributed to the specific cultural history of the area in which this 
canyon exists. 
</P>
<P>
The people of our city have a right to access our cultural history in 
monuments, as well as books, and the city recognized this almost 20 years ago, 
for example, when Stoney Point Outcroppings in north Chatsworth was designated 
due to its being "one of the most picturesque areas in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
This site is analogous to a giant redwood grove. Has familiarity blinded us? Is 
this one-of-a-kind remnant of our mountains' past natural state not worthy of 
our concern and protection? Or shall we guide it to extinction?

APPOINTED OFFICIALS SILENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. has been actively involved in trying to 
mitigate the scope of a three-story monolithic shopping center, encompassing 
one full city block, which is proposed for construction on Ventura Boulevard 
between Ventura Canyon Avenue and Woodman Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
We have had consistent acknowledgment and support from all of our elected 
officials throughout our campaign to fight this inappropriate intrusion into 
our neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Namely, Councilmen Michael Woo and Zev Yaroslavsky, and City Atty. James Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
However, what is the score card for appointed officials? Zero. On April 18 our 
subcommittee for this project sent a four-page letter, along with almost 2,000 
signatures on a petition, to Mr. Kenneth Topping, director of planning in the 
Department of City Planning. This letter and the petition specifically 
addressed the issue of this Ventura-Woodman project and the vital environmental 
factors which we felt qualified the project for an Environmental Impact Report. 
This parcel was sent by certified mail. 
</P>
<P>
It has been more than two months and we have had absolutely no response 
whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
Does this suggest an arrogance and irresponsibility on the part of appointed 
officials?

MINING IN NATIONAL FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read your May 22 article about the request of P. W. Gillibrand Co. for a 
grant for a demonstration project to mine titanium in the national forest. I 
have also viewed a videotape prepared for the Gillibrand Co., and have lived 
for 27 years on property immediately adjoining the Gillibrand claims. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, the company has been a good neighbor. Their road provides a 
firebreak and a possible emergency exit from our canyon. The huge excavations 
they have made in Oak Spring Canyon and Rabbit Canyon will provide catch basins 
which may alleviate some of our flooding problems. When the building of their 
road resulted in tremendous debris deposits in our driveway during the last 
flood, Gillibrand arranged to have it removed. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the public has lost two beautiful oak-filled canyons. 
Because of the deep excavations, it is not safe, or perhaps even possible, to 
ascend the canyons up to their springs and waterfalls. I have still seen deer 
in the area, but apparently our mountain lions have been displaced. 
</P>
<P>
I have several concerns about having taxpayer money being used to finance 
Gillibrand's further mining: 
</P>
<P>
Why should the public help finance a mining-quarrying operation on public 
lands? 
</P>
<P>
If Gillibrand is so short of cash, how can he afford to pay his workers $35 an 
hour? 
</P>
<P>
If titanium is such a valuable commodity, why is the ilmenite selling for only 
$70 a ton? 
</P>
<P>
If titanium is so necessary for this country's industry and defense, and this 
country is so dependent on foreign sources, why is Gillibrand selling it to 
Finland? 
</P>
<P>
Is it possible the mining of titanium is only incidental to Gillibrand's real 
usage of the national forest -- a rock quarry? 
</P>

MORNING BRIEFING: THEY'RE UP THE THAMES MINUS A MOBILE PADDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
George Lawson, a spokesman for the Royal Henley Regatta, wouldn't last three 
minutes in Los Angeles. This week, he and fellow officials at the 151-year-old 
rowing event pulled the plug on mobile phone users. 
</P>
<P>
"People using the place for business are out of character with the aims of the 
enclosure," Lawson said. "If we don't nip it in the bud, we will have 150 
people chattering on these phones in five years' time. We have to set 
standards." 
</P>
<P>
What a nightmare. You're watching Salisbury School and Kings School battle for 
the Princess Elizabeth Cup. The boats are stroke-for-stroke 100 meters from the 
finish. Cheering spectators crowd the banks of the Thames. And you can't call 
your broker. 
</P>
<P>
Add Henley: This year's regatta rules state that women's skirts "must cover the 
knees." In the past, they "should not be above the knee." However, because of 
constant wet weather, raincoats have made it difficult for official 
knee-checkers. In turn, local clothiers' sales have suffered because spectators 
can hide their offending hemlines, rather than return to town to buy the 
correct length. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: The U.S. Postal Service's newest commemorative stamps, issued 
Friday, salute five of America's top Olympic performers -- Eddie Eagan, Ray 
Ewry, Helene Madison, Jesse Owens and Hazel Wightman. Can you name their 
sports? 
</P>
<P>
Still not overturned: Alfred Alchendiak, 70, claims that a $140 trifecta ticket 
he bought two years ago is a $1,304 winner. He's so sure of it that he has 
filed suit against Tampa Greyhound Track, its officials and the state 
pari-mutuel board. 
</P>
<P>
Five times. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Alchendiak's suit was rejected again, but he vowed to give it a 
sixth try. 
</P>
<P>
The problem arose when track judges ruled that the third dog in Alchendiak's 
wager, Oshkosh Zest, bumped his second dog, Ari Cannon, from behind. Oshkosh 
Zest nose-dived into the track, flipped and flew across the finish line upside 
down and backward -- but ahead of the fourth dog. Alchendiak cites the racing 
rules, which say that judges "shall consider only the relative position of the 
respective noses of such greyhounds." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Eagan, boxing and bobsledding; Ewry, track and field; Madison, 
swimming; Owens, track and field; Wightman, tennis. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia footnote: Eagan is the only athlete in Olympic history to win gold 
medals in both the Summer and Winter Games. In boxing, he won the gold medal in 
the light-heavyweight division at Antwerp, Belgium, in 1920. In bobsledding, he 
was a member of the four-man sled that won at Lake Placid, N.Y., in 1932. 
Before arriving at Lake Placid, Eagan had never been in a bobsled.

profound statements on international politics for years, I've written hundreds 
of articles, but I've never received so much attention as at the World Cup 
games." TED BROCK

AND NOW A FEW WORDS ABOUT OUR ANNOUNCERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to congratulate Ken Brett on again being the master of redundancy. 
</P>
<P>
Some of my all-time Ken Brett favorites: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Wally Joyner just completed an unassisted double play by himself." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The Baltimore Orioles team is experiencing many problems this year 
collectively as a group." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The average age of the Chicago White Sox team is 26 years per man." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "We have already had the plate umpire carried off the field barely under 
his own power." 
</P>
<P>
It is amazing to me the Angels continue to retain a guy who is the most 
inarticulate announcer in baseball. When you add analysis/paralysis Al Conin 
with Ken, they form an incredibly bad team -- simultaneously and at the same 
time.

WHINING DODGERS NOT WINNING OVER FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I found your article, "Dodgers Sprung in Spring" (June 26), absolutely 
nauseating. 
</P>
<P>
It's sickening to listen to grown men playing baseball whine about the 
shortened spring training causing their injuries. What, they don't have enough 
time during the off-season to get/stay in shape? I suppose when you make only a 
half a million or so dollars during baseball season, you have to spend your 
off-season pumping gas to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the amount of money you make, if you are not in top condition by 
the time spring training rolls around, it's nobody's fault but your own. So 
stop sniveling or get a job.

WHINING DODGERS NOT WINNING OVER FANS

<P>
Let's be honest. Fernando's no-hitter notwithstanding, the Dodgers are a bore. 
</P>
<P>
There's more enthusiasm on Death Row than there is on the Dodger bench. They 
can't hit, field or run, but they lead the league in yawns. Fred Claire has put 
together a collection of strangers, and Tom Lasorda is too busy selling things 
on TV to notice. Peter O'Malley had better do something pretty soon, or Chavez 
Ravine will be returned to the goats.

ANGELS BLOW AN 8-4 LEAD, WIN, 9-8, IN 16 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<DATELINE>

MILWAUKEE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
First Dave Winfield kept the Angels in a game they had won for seven innings, 
nearly lost in the eighth and then were forced to work overtime to gain some 
semblence of control. His catch in the 14th inning kept the game under control. 
</P>
<P>
Then he scored the winning run in the 16th inning on Dante Bichette's topper to 
give the Angels a 9-8 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers Friday night in the 
longest game of the season for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Minton was the winning pitcher after being activated from the disabled 
list earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Wags here say the Brewers' emblem, which features a ball nestled safely in a 
glove, would be more accurate if it depicted a ball falling out of that glove. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers are the American League's worst fielding team, and they showed how 
richly they deserve that distinction Friday when they committed six errors. 
</P>
<P>
The errors gave Milwaukee 87 for the season. The Angels are second-worst at 76. 
</P>
<P>
Aided by the six Milwaukee errors, the Angels scored more runs for pitcher Mark 
Langston Friday than they did in his last five starts. That was all to no avail 
because Langston, who had lost his last four decisions, was unable to protect 
leads of 5-2 and 8-4. In his last 10 starts since he was an 8-3 winner over 
Milwaukee on May 15, Langston is 1-6 with three no-decisions. Overall, the 
29-year-old left-hander is 4-9. 
</P>
<P>
Langston was charged with seven earned runs Friday in 7 2/3 innings, raising 
his earned-run average to 3.71. He walked five and struck out four for a total 
of 107 strikeouts in 119 innings. He leads the Angel staff in innings pitched. 
</P>
<P>
The six errors -- which included a hat trick on three routine plays by 
shortstop Kiki Diaz -- tied a Brewers' club record set on July 26, 1978, 
against the Angels. The muffs undermined the efforts of starter Dennis Powell 
and reliever Jaime Navarro and rendered seven of the Angels' eight runs 
unearned. 
</P>
<P>
The only untainted run resulted from Dave Winfield's two-run home run in the 
sixth inning, Winfield's 10th homer of the season. It followed an error by 
third baseman Gary Sheffield on a grounder by Johnny Ray. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels took a 3-0 lead in the first inning on the springboard of second 
baseman Jim Gantner's error on a grounder by leadoff hitter Brian Downing. 
Lance Parrish drew a bases-loaded walk to force in the first run, and Dante 
Bichette drove in two more with a single to left. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee got two runs back in the bottom of the inning when Langston struggled 
with his control. He walked three, then yielded a two-run single to Greg Brock 
with two out, continuing his habit of allowing a high percentage of two-out 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
Diaz's first error, on a Dave Winfield grounder, allowed Downing to score for a 
4-2 Angel lead after he had walked, moved to second on a single and to third on 
a grounder. The Angels added a run in the third inning when Bichette doubled 
and scored when Diaz threw away Jack Howell's grounder for a two-base error. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers cut their deficit to 5-4 in the fifth. Singles by Diaz and 
Sheffield put runners on first and second, and Dave Parker -- Milwaukee's lone 
representative in Tuesday's All-Star Game -- drove them in with a double that 
rolled past the glove of center fielder Bichette. Winfield, the right fielder, 
recovered in time to throw back to the infield where a relay beat Parker to 
third base. 
</P>
<P>
Winfield's home run into the left-field seats gave the Angels a 7-4 lead, and 
they added a run in the seventh inning on singles by Howell and Schofield and 
an error by Sveum, who had replaced the hapless Diaz at short. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee erased that lead by batting around in the eighth against Langston and 
Mark Eichhorn. All of their runs were scored with two out, and the tying run 
scored on Sheffield's perfectly executed squeeze bunt. 
</P>
<P>
The danger began when Rob Deer walked with one out. Brock doubled past Wally 
Joyner at first, sending Deer to third. The Angels turned Greg Vaughn's 
fielder's choice grounder into an out at home, although Deer didn't appear to 
touch the plate and catcher Lance Parrish didn't appear to tag him. 
</P>
<P>
The inning continued when B.J. Surhoff lined a single past Langston's head, 
scoring Brock and moving Vaughn to third. That was all for Langston, who threw 
124 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
Eichhorn struggled through the rest of the inning. Sveum singled to center, 
scoring Vaughn, and Jim Gantner singled to right, scoring Surhoff. Sheffield 
scored Sveum with the fourth run of the inning when he bunted toward third, a 
slow roller Jack Howell charged but couldn't play in time to first. Robin Yount 
ended the inning by grounding into a force play. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels loaded the bases in the ninth by working out three walks (one 
intentional) against Milwaukee reliever Dan Plesac, but the Brewers got out of 
that jam with a rare bit of fine fielding. The Brewers pitched carefully to 
Dick Schofield before walking him to get to Downing, and Downing vindicated 
that decision by bouncing into a double play, third to home to first. 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Reliever Bryan Harvey left the club to be with his father, Stan, who suffered a 
mild heart attack Thursday in North Carolina. A club spokesman said Harvey will 
get as much time off as necessary. Stan Harvey, 47, was in guarded condition 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Doug Rader said Harvey's absence had some influence on his decision to 
activate Greg Minton off the 60-day disabled list Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Minton arrived at County Stadium at 12:30 p.m. planning to run and pitch in a 
simulated game, not expecting to be activated. "I walk in and Doug says, 'We're 
not going to simulate you today. We're going to stimulate you,' " Minton said.

OFFICIALS TAKE RACEWAY WIN FROM BRADER 
</P>

<P>
It was easy come, easy go for Lynn Brader at Ventura Raceway on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Brader, of Somis, squeezed between a pair of cars on the front straightaway of 
the final lap of the Street Stock 15-lap oval main event for an apparent 
victory. But the aggressive move was apparently too aggressive for the 
officials, who penalized Brader for rough driving and dropped him to fourth 
place, giving Brett Miller of Oxnard his first main-event win of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Don Keeter of Ventura was awarded second with third going to Bill Famularo of 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Things were not quite so wild in the Mini Stock 20-lap oval main event as 
Ventura's Marty Desbrow drove to his second consecutive victory, boosting his 
season points leadership over Chris Raschke of Ventura, who finished third. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Moore of Oxnard finished second. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Firsich of Port Hueneme padded his figure-eight season points lead with an 
easy victory in the six-lap main event. Scott Olsen of Ventura was second and 
Miller third. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Silva of Port Hueneme went wire-to-wire to win the Mini Stock eight-lap 
figure-eight main event. The victory moved Silva within 100 points of season 
points leader Richard Webster of Camarillo, who finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Swauger of Ojai and John Csorba of Oxnard were second and third, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Eight-lap Mini Stock heat-race winners were Mike Spencer of Oxnard, Kevin 
Parker of Ventura and Raschke. Street Stock heat winners were Don Famularo of 
Simi Valley and Bill Pate of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Swenson of Ventura outclassed the field to win the Mini Stock 10-lap 
semi-main event to head-up a four-car contingent qualifying for the main event. 
Also moving up were Ken Hewitt of Moorpark, Spencer, and Brandon King of 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Six-lap Trophy Dash winners were Keeter in the Street Stocks and Webster in the 
Mini Stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Fast one-lap qualifying times were set by Jim Powell Jr. of Cypress in the 
Street Stocks, at 16.865 seconds, and Desbrow in the Mini Stocks at 17.767. 
</P>
<P>
The Winged Outlaw Mini Sprints from the San Joaquin Valley area will make their 
only appearance of the season at the Raceway tonight at 7. 
</P>
<P>
The Mini Stocks will also be running with a double-points, double-purse 
program.

STORM OWNER DELAYS DECISION; MISL OWNERS TO TALK MONDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A decision that could have a major impact on the future of the MISL was put off 
Friday until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The league is awaiting word from San Jose's Milan Mandaric, owner of the St. 
Louis Storm, who has said he expects to fold the team because he cannot find 
St. Louis investors. In its first season, the Storm reportedly lost $1.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Mandaric had said he would make the decision by Friday, but two owners -- 
including the Sockers' Ron Fowler -- said it now looked as if Mandaric would 
wait until a scheduled conference call between the owners Monday at 9 a.m. 
(PDT). 
</P>
<P>
If the Storm were to fold, it might just be the first to go. The MISL would 
then be down to seven franchises, and Fowler has said in the past that he did 
not want to go on funding the Sockers if the league does not field at least 
eight teams. 
</P>
<P>
But hope remains on two fronts. 
</P>
<P>
First, other owners could talk Mandaric into continuing. A source at the league 
office said Mandaric's decision is not a financial one, but rather "more 
emotional. He's just disappointed in the resolve of the St. Louis area. He 
could continue . . . but obviously he can't go on losing $2 million forever." 
</P>
<P>
Phil Cobb, Dallas Sidekicks' owner, agreed that Mandaric is not considering 
folding the team for financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps it's not the money," Cobb said. "Milan came into the league just 
before the season last year and really didn't have any time to put together a 
front office or a season-ticket sales staff. And he lives in San Jose, so he's 
a little bummed out about commuting back and forth. He was just looking for a 
sign from the St. Louis business community, and I don't believe he's got the 
support he was looking for." 
</P>
<P>
Mandaric, a native of Yugoslavia who made his fortune in Silicon Valley, was 
looking for 20 investors to help save the franchise. Published reports have 
said two have stepped forward. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Earl Foreman is expected to lobby Mandaric over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Foreman nor Mandaric returned phone calls Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The second area of hope concerns two proposals submitted to Foreman by Fowler. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler would not discuss the proposals other than to say that one had to do 
with his maintaining ownership of the Sockers if the league operates with just 
six other franchises. That proposal, he said, "includes significant 
stipulations." 
</P>
<P>
He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
MISL sources said they had heard Mandaric might become a partial owner of the 
Sockers if the Storm folds. Fowler did not rule out the possibility but said he 
had not discussed it with Mandaric. 
</P>
<P>
"Milan and I are friends," Fowler said. "And at this point, I would say 
anything is possible." 
</P>
<P>
But that arrangement might not go over well with other owners. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard that rumor," Cobb said. "but I don't know what that accomplishes 
other than it helps Ron Fowler. I think we all lose a little bit if we go to a 
seven-team league. Our league expenses (dues paid to the MISL, currently 
$160,000 per team per year) go up, it's less entertainment for our fans, and I 
think it makes it more difficult for the commissioner to do what he does best, 
which is solicit a TV contract and make way for expansion." 
</P>
<P>
One ominous sign: Storm Coach Don Popovic has coached five other indoor soccer 
teams. All have folded.

'SIDEWALK SURFING' ON CREST OF ANOTHER BOOM DESPITE PROBLEMS;

SKATEBOARDING: SKATE PARKS HAVE COME AND GONE, BUT WITH A RISE IN POPULARITY,

<P>
Mike Ryan of Loma Portal remembers stealing his little sister's metal 
roller-skates when he was a boy, nailing them onto the bottom of a two-by-four, 
then attaching a soap box to the top of what is now considered a 
first-generation skateboard. 
</P>
<P>
He used to deliver newspapers with the contraption, but he soon discovered that 
without the soap box, the thing made a pretty fun toy. And, hey, sidewalks 
seemed to be designed especially for it. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just the thrill of going down the sidewalk and hearing the 
clickety-clacks of the wheels hitting the cracks getting closer and closer 
together," Ryan remembered. "And then it was a matter of where I was going to 
bail, where was the nearest lawn I could jump onto." 
</P>
<P>
Yep, Ryan considered himself something of a daredevil, but now he wouldn't even 
contemplate the things skateboarders do, such as hurling themselves 20 feet 
into the air, coming down safely on a wooden ramp, then soaring off the other 
side of the ramp. 
</P>
<P>
What the Beachboys once referred to as "sidewalk surfing" has, like rock music 
itself, evolved. 
</P>
<P>
You don't hear many do-wahs in rock &amp; roll these days and you don't see 
many people riding a plank with metal wheels down the sidewalk. Bands have 
become as nasty as they wanna be, and skateboarders have become as gnarly as 
they wanna be. 
</P>
<P>
Not only has the sport changed radically, it also has flourished. According to 
the latest numbers compiled by the National Skateboard Assn., there are 10 
million skateboarders in the United States (no local figures were available). 
</P>
<P>
But there's a problem: No place to skate. 
</P>
<P>
"The older generation gets into biking," said Dennis Bullock, 20, manager of 
Just Skate, Ryan's store that caters to skateboarders. "So they've had bike 
paths built all over. But kids have been skating for over 30 years, and 
skateparks have come and gone. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, there's nowhere to go." 
</P>
<P>
It hasn't always been that way. In the late 1970s, skateboard parks abounded, 
but soon enough, they suffered a rash of liability lawsuits that resulted in 
skyrocketing insurance premiums. Eventually, most just shut down. 
</P>
<P>
"If it were up to me," said Calixto Hernandez, 19, of Ocean Beach, "I'd rather 
skate on ramps, rather than get into the street scene where there's so many bad 
vibes and irate business owners. But because there are no parks, I've been 
forced to skate anywhere I can find." 
</P>
<P>
Two skateboard parks have opened locally in the past two years, providing an 
alternative to illegally skating on streets and public property -- but only to 
those who have transportation to get to them. One is in Carlsbad, the other in 
Linda Vista. 
</P>
<P>
The Linda Vista Boys' Club Skatepark is associated with the Boy Scouts and thus 
gets around the liability problem by using the scouts' insurance. Mike McGill's 
Skatepark in Carlsbad has its own policy, but McGill, 24, a professional 
skateboarder, said because of the high cost, he rarely turns a profit. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, 40, says the insurance companies' worries are unfounded. Ryan, who hopes 
to operate a park at Robb Field to alleviate skateboard congestion on Ocean 
Beach sidewalks, has compiled data from around the country. 
</P>
<P>
Among his findings: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Today's skateparks do not provide the hard, concrete ditches that were a 
mainstay in the 1970s. Instead, they consist of wooden ramps on which 
skateboarders have learned to fall without seriously injuring themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The city of Santa Cruz has operated a public skateboard play area since 
1978 and has had only two lawsuits, one of which resulted in a small, 
out-of-court settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The city of Virginia Beach has operated three skateboard ramps since 1984 
and entertained 18,130 users in its first three years. In that time, there were 
36 minor injuries and 15 fractures. There were no insurance claims. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An Ocean City, Md., skateboard ramp has been in use for 10 years and has 
had no insurance claims. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1985, the National Safety Council found that there were 581,784 injuries 
related to cycling, 395,000 injuries related to baseball and 37,326 injuries 
related to skateboarding. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Robb Field site, Ryan would like to see one skateboard park in each 
city council district, arguing they would get kids off the streets and may even 
provide an alternative to drug use. 
</P>
<P>
He's not alone in advancing that theory. George Loveland, head of the San Diego 
Parks and Recreation Department, agreed -- to a degree. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Ryan is touting (skateboard parks) as an answer to the problems kids are 
having on the streets and with drugs these days," Loveland said. "And it would 
be, but there would have to be an awful lot of these things to make a dent." 
</P>
<P>
Because of city budget cuts, a skateboard park in each district appears to be 
out of the question, Ryan admitted. 
</P>
<P>
But even if Ryan were able to get a couple parks built, there will always be a 
few skateboarders who prefer the street scene, kids who find it part of the fun 
to seek out new parking lots, malls, school yards or drained swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a lot of fun to go out and find a new place," said San Diego's Robert 
Wages, 16. "It's like an adventure." 
</P>
<P>
Some older skateboarders go as far as chartering private planes to fly around 
the county in search of empty swimming pools, according to several skaters. 
</P>
<P>
But the main thrust in the sport is vertical skating, using plywood ramps 
pushed together end-to-end to form what skaters call a half-pipe. 
</P>
<P>
A standard half-pipe has banks 11 feet high, the top 18 inches of which is 
completely vertical. It stretches 34 feet long (16 feet of which is flat) and 
is 20 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
Good skateboarders make it appear as though gravity does all the work. They 
simply slide down one end of the half-pipe and use the resulting momentum to 
scale the other end. On average, they get themselves and their boards five feet 
above the ramp's edge (some go more than 10 feet above) before turning around 
and heading back down . . . and back up the other side. 
</P>
<P>
In truth it takes a lot of physical exertion to shift one's weight around and 
maintain balance. It's so strenuous, most skateboarders can only go back and 
forth a few times before running short of breath. But in a couple minutes, 
they're right back at it. 
</P>
<P>
"You just keep doing it even if you get tired just because it's so much fun," 
said Jimmy Brandenburg, 15, of Santee. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a rush," said Matt Carruthers, 20, of Ocean Beach. "You go fast and do 
your own thing. It lets out a lot of aggression. It's like being on a 
roller-coaster, but you're driving." 
</P>
<P>
Added Jerry Warila, 15, of University City, "It's like a sober high. When 
you're five feet above the ramp and looking down, it feels great."

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: MCKNIGHT RE-SIGNS WITH CHARGERS FOR ONE YEAR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Offensive lineman Dennis McKnight, entering his eighth year in the NFL, has 
re-signed with the Chargers, the team announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Financial terms of the one-year contract were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
McKnight, scheduled to play left guard this year, started every regular-season 
game in four consecutive seasons for the Chargers from 1985 to 1988 but missed 
all of last season with a knee injury suffered during the final preseason game. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured it was better to make a shorter deal because he is coming off an 
injury and has to prove himself to a new general manager (Bobby Beathard)," 
said McKnight's agent, Jim Steiner of St. Louis. "We'd rather he come back and 
show (Beathard) that he can play like he did two years ago when he was an 
alternate for the Pro Bowl, then we can go in and make a longer deal." 
</P>
<P>
McKnight has played center, guard and tackle during his Charger career and 
earned the spot as a Pro Bowl alternate in 1988 as a left guard. CURT HOLBREICH

<P>
TRADE MEANS CLASS A'S TREATMENT TO AFENIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Oakland A's would get little argument calling themselves the best 
organization in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the past four American League rookies of the year and 20 players that 
helped win the 1989 World Series came from the A's player development system. 
(The fact they call it a player development system, instead of something such 
as minor league operations, says a lot.) 
</P>
<P>
So Escondido's Troy Afenir was quite pleased to be traded to the A's from the 
Houston Astros' organization just before the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
And late Wednesday night, Afenir was called up to the big leagues to replace 
catcher Terry Steinbach, who was placed on the 15-day disabled list retroactive 
to July 3. 
</P>
<P>
"(The trade) was the best thing that happened to me. Things are going a lot 
smoother and a lot more honest over here," said Afenir, who spent the first 
part of this year as a catcher for the Tacoma Tigers, Oakland's triple-A 
affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
Afenir was not treated horribly by the Astros. He was called up to the big 
leagues from double-A at the end of the 1987 season and batted .300 (six for 
20) in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
But Afenir says the two organizations don't compare. 
</P>
<P>
"The part that I like is that people are honest over here," Afenir said of the 
A's. "Sometimes you're not going to want to hear what they say, but they'll 
tell you. They're very straightforward. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, they've shown they care about you as a person. You're not just a 
commodity." 
</P>
<P>
Afenir, who was on Oakland's 40-man roster this spring, extended his praise to 
A's Manager Tony LaRussa. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a handle on everything," Afenir said. "The first day we got to camp, 
(LaRussa) got all the young guys together and told us, 'The lockout is really 
going to hurt some of you guys. We have to go with the veterans.' 
</P>
<P>
"Later in the day, he pulled me aside and said, 'Af, you were one of the guys 
that really had a chance to make this club.' " 
</P>
<P>
At least temporarily, Afenir has made it after helping Tacoma win the first 
half in the Pacific Coast League's Northern Division while hitting .269 with 10 
home runs and 34 RBIs in 57 games. 
</P>
<P>
Over the final two months last year, Afenir hit .270 with nine homers and 32 
RBIs for double-A Huntsville (Ala.). He spent the first two months in 
rehabilitation from surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff. 
</P>
<P>
Afenir said he injured his throwing shoulder early in the 1988 season, but the 
Astros wanted him to play through the season at first base and outfield. Then, 
the day after the season, they sent him to get the shoulder examined, and 
surgery was performed. 
</P>
<P>
Afenir said when he came to camp the following spring with a sore shoulder, the 
Astros seemed mystified and upset. They finally dealt him to the A's on April 
6, 1989, for another catcher, Matt Sinatro. 
</P>
<P>
Afenir graduated from Escondido High in 1981 and Palomar College in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, it wasn't until after he had been drafted three times that Afenir, 
6-feet-4, 195 pounds, put together a tremendous season. That came during his 
sophomore year at Palomar, when he hit 13 homers and had 43 RBIs in 30 games. 
During one game against Mesa College, he hit three home runs before flying out 
to the warning track in his fourth at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
Before he had even played a game at Palomar, the Cubs made him the No. 2 pick 
in the nation in the January, 1982, free-agent draft. He thought about signing, 
but a week before the season, he ripped tendons near his thumb when he stuck 
his hand through a window trying to break into his locked apartment. 
</P>
<P>
Surgery followed, and he was out for most of his freshman year. That didn't 
stop Baltimore from drafting him in June, but Afenir declined that offer, too. 
Seven months later, he was drafted by Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Horn, a former star at Morse High, was recalled by the Baltimore Orioles 
after hitting .414 with nine home runs and 26 RBIs in 17 games with triple-A 
Rochester. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Horn was named the International League's player of the week for 
hitting .500 with four homers and 12 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Dickson, a graduate of Grossmont High who also played for Arizona, is off 
to a super start in his pro career with the Cubs organization in single-A 
Geneva (N.Y.). In his first 17 innings, Dickson struck out 29 and allowed just 
five hits while going 2-1 with a 0.53 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
Beto Rodriguez, a first baseman from U.S. International, hit .371 (10 for 31) 
with 12 RBIs in his first 10 games as a pro at Johnson City (Tenn.), the 
Cardinals' rookie league club.

FLAGS AND QUOTATIONS

Robert M. Ross, in his June 23 letter defending flag burning, quoted Samuel 
Adams as saying, "I disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death 
your right to say it." Voltaire is generally credited with an almost identical 
quotation. 
</P>
<P>
Francois Marie Arouet Voltaire was born in 1694 and was 38 years old when 
Samuel Adams was born. 
</P>
<P>
However, the sentiment is a good one, and Ross will allow my right to say that 
with all of the serious problems today that require massive amounts of money, 
funding for the National Endowment for the Arts seems like a frivolous pursuit. 
How many geniuses has the NEA unearthed?

 Bartlett's "Familiar Quotations" says of "I disapprove of what you say, but I 
will defend to the death your right to say it": "This sentence is not 
Voltaire's but was first used in quoting a letter from Voltaire to Helvetius in 
'The Friends of Voltaire' (1906) by S.G. Tallentyre. She claims it was a 
paraphrase of Voltaire's words in the 'Essay on Tolerance': 'Think for yourself 
and let other enjoy the privilege to do so too.' "

NO NASTY MARINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On June 27, Calendar reported that Marine Corps officials in a number of bases 
have removed 2 Live Crew's rap album "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" from base 
stores ("The Marines Have Landed -- on 2 Live Crew"). I guess the reasoning is 
that young and impressionable troops don't know what's best for them. 
</P>
<P>
This is, of course, outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
If young Marines are mature enough to decide they're willing to die for this 
country and its First Amendment freedoms, they're mature enough to enjoy these 
freedoms and decide what music they will listen to. Were the (probably 
predominantly white and middle-aged) censors willing to die in their place, it 
might be another matter. 
</P>
<P>
The article says Camp Pendleton's Lt. Col. G. C. Schoppe "reviewed the record 
personally" before he pulled it. My tax dollars were spent to pay a military 
officer to listen to rap? Oh well, I suppose some good may come of it. At least 
it will keep alive the Marine tradition of moral purity that produced Col. 
"Shredder" North.

I was relieved to hear that both the Navy and the Marines have banned sales of 
"As Nasty as They Wanna Be." 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure their reason for the ban was not censorship but rather to protect 
their tender recruits from hearing the foul language and sexually explicit 
material contained on this album. 
</P>
<P>
After all, when a sailor comes into port, illicit sex is the furthest thing 
from his mind. 
</P>

And any drill instructor can tell you how easily a Marine is offended by foul 
language.

How can Times Music Critic Martin Bernheimer pass so easily from his sometimes 
interesting reviews about Wagner's "Ring" in San Francisco to a commentary on 
"Oklahoma!" (June 25)? 
</P>
<P>
Operas and musical comedy cannot be friends, for they talk a totally different 
language. 
</P>
<P>
The musicals regurgitate half-truths, half-dramas, half-thoughts, half-music 
that can make Middle America perfectly happy -- but not those accustomed to the 
absolute wholeness of Mozart, Beethoven and Bach. 
</P>
<P>
"Richard Rodgers' inspired score remains a revelation (eat your mask out, A.L. 
Webber!)." So Bernheimer says. But if he uses such distinguished words as 
inspired and revelation for the little notes of Rodgers, what terms he can 
adopt to describe the power of Beethoven's music? 
</P>
<P>
The musical is an American form of music, as some contend? Wrong again. The 
musical is nothing but the stale, surpassed and silly operetta of our Austrian 
and Polish great-great-grandfathers.

JACKIE &amp; ROY STILL SPARKLE

<TEXT>
<P>
Hearing Jackie Cain and Roy Kral is a bit like traveling through a time warp. 
Their opening set at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill Thursday night was filled with 
the same buoyantly swinging, brightly spirited vocal jazz that has been the 
duo's stock in trade for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Cain's blond tresses have turned to silver, and Kral has added a few more worry 
lines, but the blend of their voices -- one of the most distinctive sounds in 
jazz -- has lost none of its sparkle. What made this evening different was a 
marked increase in Cain's ballad singing, and an unusually varied program of 
unfamiliar material. The heart of the set was a collection of Alec Wilder 
songs. Familiar items like "It's So Peaceful in the Country" and "I'll Be 
Around" were included, of course, but Jackie &amp; Roy also dug deeply into the 
more obscure depths of the Wilder ouevre. 
</P>
<P>
Kral's richly harmonic piano playing, aided by the able assistance of bassist 
Seward McKay and drummer Curt Moore, provided a sturdy foundation for the 
ballads. Cain made the most of the support, especially on a lush version of 
"You're My Thrill" and a serene interpretation of a "Spring Can Really Hang You 
Up the Most." DON HECKMAN

'PIECE OF CAKE': HISTORY WITH THE BLEMISHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"The game's afoot," entones Squadron Leader Rex, shoulders back, head high, 
teeth clenched, upper lip stiff. "The struggle is becoming more arduous. 
</P>
<P>
Now is the time to stand shoulder to shoulder. Let us close ranks and show the 
Boche what we're made of." 
</P>
<P>
His flock of Spitfires swoops off the green fields of France and into the 
blazing sky to engage the Heinkels and Messerschmitts. It all smells of romance 
and easy victory. 
</P>
<P>
The title of "Piece of Cake," a six-part miniseries commencing Sunday night on 
"Masterpiece Theatre" (9 p.m. Channels 28 and 15; 8 p.m. Channels 50 and 24), 
suggests grand tales of the RAF in WWII, as seen through the bright eyes and 
gun-sights of Hornet Squadron, 1939-40. 
</P>
<P>
But the title is full of cynical ironies, as related by Derek Robinson in his 
sometimes grim novel about the myth of the RAF flyboys during the Big One. They 
were in his reality a twisted mix of fresh and frightened lads, some 
embittered, some brash, and no amount of fervent oratory by Squadron Leader Rex 
could itself win the day. Bloody lessons had to be learned. 
</P>
<P>
(The day eventually is won and glory affirmed, but the series drew bitter 
hostility from legions in England who would prefer history without blemish.) 
</P>
<P>
"Piece of Cake," adapted by Leon Griffiths and directed by Ian Toynton, 
creates, then kills, some memorable men. Aerial scenes are easy and beguiling, 
although the gunfights are flat. Of course, how wonderful need the killing be? 
The point is easily made. IRV LETOFSKY

PRESIDENT OF BULGARIA QUITS UNDER PRESSURE

SOFIA, Bulgaria 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bowing to mounting pressure, Bulgarian President Petar Mladenov submitted his 
resignation Friday amid swirling controversy over remarks caught on videotape 
last December in which he talked about using tanks to disperse an 
anti-government protest. 
</P>
<P>
Mladenov's letter of resignation was read on national television at 8 p.m., 
meeting a deadline set by striking students in an ultimatum issued earlier in 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
His decision to step down sent thousands of Bulgarians into the streets to 
rejoice. 
</P>
<P>
"Never again a Communist president in Bulgaria!" an activist of the opposition 
Union of Democratic Forces told about 5,000 people gathered outside Mladenov's 
office after he quit. 
</P>
<P>
"Never! Never!" they shouted back. Many chanted "Victory!" and danced and 
hugged each other. Some carried banners that called Mladenov a liar. Others 
pulled model tanks up and down the pavement, mocking the former president. 
</P>
<P>
Mladenov, a Communist reformer who oversaw Bulgaria's transition to a 
multi-party democracy, submitted his resignation to the newly elected 
Parliament "in order not to be a reason to increase political tension," 
Bulgarian television reported. 
</P>
<P>
Political opposition parties and hundreds of student protesters had joined in 
calls for his resignation. Even the newspaper of the Bulgarian Socialist Party 
-- the former Communist Party -- joined calls for his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"Politics is a man's game," the newspaper Douma said in a front-page editorial. 
"Someone who is not good enough has to leave the stage." 
</P>
<P>
The Union of Democratic Forces issued a statement also urging Mladenov to 
resign. Trade unions, other opposition groups and the mainstream Agrarian Party 
also backed the students' demands, the official BTA news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
The attacks on Mladenov were sparked by an amateur videotape in which he is 
heard to say "Let the tanks come" to quash a stormy protest last Dec. 14. About 
50,000 demonstrators had converged on Parliament to demand that the Communist 
Party give up its monopoly on power. But they later dispersed peacefully and 
tanks were not called in. 
</P>
<P>
The words -- seemingly addressed to no one in particular -- have also been 
translated as "It is better for the tanks to come." 
</P>
<P>
The videotape was broadcast on TV on an election program by the Union of 
Democratic Forces, three days before the June 17 parliamentary runoff 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
After weeks of silence, Mladenov, in a nationwide television address on 
Wednesday, implicitly admitted having called for the use of tanks during the 
protests but said that his words had been taken out of context. He also said 
that he opposes violence and never intended that tanks be deployed against 
anti-government demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply convinced the Bulgarian people . . . would not believe the word, 
but the deed," Mladenov said, seeking to put the controversy to rest. 
</P>
<P>
But his comments came only after experts said the videotape was authentic. He 
had earlier said the video had been doctored. 
</P>
<P>
Political observers said many Bulgarians were angered not so much by the words 
themselves as by Mladenov's initial refusal to acknowledge that he made the 
remark, despite the clear evidence of the videotape, which was examined by 
specialists and determined to be authentic. 
</P>
<P>
Mladenov, 53, was initially regarded as a reformer after ousting veteran 
Communist leader Todor Zhivkov in a party purge last November. 
</P>
<P>
After replacing Zhivkov as Communist Party leader and president, Mladenov 
immediately began taking cautious steps toward reform and opened a dialogue 
with opposition groups that quickly organized. 
</P>
<P>
He became president in April and led the country to its first free elections in 
four decades last month. 
</P>
<P>
Also in April, the Communists changed their name to the Socialist Party and 
ended up winning 211 of the 400 seats in Parliament in the June elections. The 
Union of Democratic Forces won 144 seats. 
</P>
<P>
Mladenov was to have served until the Parliament drew up a new democratic 
constitution, in about 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Andrei Lukanov appeared on national TV shortly after Mladenov's 
resignation was announced and appealed for order so the Parliament could meet 
Tuesday for its first session in a calm atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 of the student strikers had gathered in front of the presidential 
building since Wednesday to press their demands for Mladenov's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
They had called for a 30-minute warning strike if Mladenov did not step down by 
8 p.m. Friday and a general strike on Monday if he had not resigned by then. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the original demands of the students, on strike since June 11, have 
been fulfilled, including the resignation of the TV director and publication of 
alleged election irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
But according to BTA, the students drew up a new list of demands Friday. They 
have demanded that a date be set for a public trial of Zhivkov, 78, who is in 
detention. He has been charged with misappropriation of state property, 
inciting ethnic hostility and grave abuse of power. 
</P>
<P>
They also demand the removal of parliamentary deputies associated with the 
former Communist regime's decisions, such as setting up harsh prison camps and 
agreeing to take part in the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.

LIQUOR INDUSTRY POURS IN MILLIONS TO FIGHT TAX HIKE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Alcoholic beverage giants like Miller, Jim Beam, Bacardi, Seagrams and Hiram 
Walker are pouring a lot more into California these days than cold beer, rum 
and bourbon. They are sending money. Big money. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, the nation's alcoholic beverage interests have been spending 
millions of dollars in the state to defeat what one industry leader calls the 
"single gravest threat to our industry since Prohibition." 
</P>
<P>
Fearful that California once again might be a bellwether for the nation, they 
are joining the native wine industry in battling a ballot initiative dubbed by 
its promoters the "nickel-a-drink" tax increase. Radio ads attacking the 
initiative have been running since mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
The industry has invested more than $12 million in a unique strategy that 
industry officials hope will not only kill the initiative, but immunize them 
against future efforts by do-gooders to hike their taxes. 
</P>
<P>
"In truth, this is the home of the California wine industry and the 
consequences to us of the (tax hike) are devastating because it will have 
repercussions around the country," said John De Luca, president of the 
California Wine Institute. "We are deeply concerned about this virus spreading 
to other states." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Becker, vice president for alcohol issues for the Washington-based Beer 
Institute, said his organization considers the initiative such a threat to its 
industry that it has departed from its normal policy of not involving itself in 
state issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Things that happen in California have a way of creeping eastward," Becker 
said. "It is very important to look at California as a model state. That's why 
we have high visibility on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
The nickel-a-drink initiative -- backed by an array of public interest, mental 
health and law enforcement groups -- would impose a steep new tax on the 
industry for the first time in decades. 
</P>
<P>
The tax on wine, a favorite son that last shouldered a tax increase in 1937, 
would jump from a penny a gallon to $1.29 a gallon. Beer, which has been taxed 
at 4 cents a gallon since 1959, would go to 57.5 cents a gallon. The tax on 
distilled spirits would jump from the $2 a gallon imposed in 1967 to $8.40 per 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated $700 million a year the new tax would raise would be designated 
for the prevention and treatment of alcohol and drug problems, emergency and 
trauma care services, child-abuse programs, law enforcement and programs to 
serve the health needs of children and pregnant women who are victims of 
alcoholism and drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"The Legislature and the governor have shown themselves incapable of imposing 
taxes on big industries that are not paying their fair share and the only way 
to raise those taxes is to let the voters do it," said Jim Schultz, policy 
analyst for Consumers Union, a supporter of the initiative. "The voters are 
quite willing to do it but they want some guarantees as to what (the revenues) 
will be used for." 
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that polls show some public acceptance of tax increases for 
specific purposes, liquor interests have hired consultants and public relations 
experts to devise a complex and expensive strategy for defeating the 
nickel-a-drink measure. The strategy calls first for a well-financed campaign 
to oppose the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The next step, in an attempt to siphon votes away from that proposal, dictates 
that liquor interests seek voter approval of a rival measure -- also on the 
November ballot. That measure would impose a much smaller tax hike, about $200 
million a year, and leave to the discretion of the Legislature how the new 
revenue should be used. The route to the ballot for this measure was through 
the Legislature, which approved the lesser tax as a proposed constitutional 
amendment last week. 
</P>
<P>
The final step in the strategy calls for a marriage of convenience with 
anti-tax groups who are sponsoring a ballot measure that would require a 
two-thirds vote of the people for any tax increase levied for a special 
purpose. If approved, that measure would apply to the nickel-a-drink initiative 
-- and would kill the tax hike if it mustered less than 67% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
By the last reporting period in May, Taxpayers for Common Sense -- the 
organization formed by the industry to fight the proposal -- had collected 
$10.6 million to fight the higher tax measure. Most of the donations came from 
out of state. 
</P>
<P>
They included $3.9 million from the Washington-based Beer Institute, $996,694 
from Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons Inc. of New York, $395,911 from Heublein Inc. 
of Connecticut, $290,868 from Detroit-based Hiram Walker Allied Vintners Inc., 
$181,108 from Bacardi Corp. and Bacardi Imports Inc. of Miami and Puerto Rico, 
$86,646 from Miller Brewing Co. of Milwaukee and $192,503 from Jim Beam Brands 
Co. of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
Although a large portion of the money will be saved for television advertising 
in the weeks before the election, the organization is spending $1 million 
immediately for a radio and newspaper advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
De Luca, of the Wine Institute, said the initial advertising blitz is an 
attempt to introduce and frame the issue for the opinion makers of the state -- 
editorial writers, television commentators and leaders of civic groups who will 
make recommendations on ballot issues to their organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"The so-called 'nickel-a-drink' (description) is a catchy phrase and it's very 
difficult to overcome," he said. 
</P>
<P>
While none of the industry organizations are formally endorsing the anti-tax 
initiative, De Luca conceded that individual companies have heavy financial 
involvement in that campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"The significance for us is not only to defeat the (nickel-a-drink) initiative 
but to keep this from recurring every two years," DeLuca said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the $3.1 million already collected by Taxpayers Coalition for the Right to 
Vote, the campaign organization promoting the anti-tax initiative, 
approximately $1.5 million has come from alcoholic beverage interests and 
related industries. The cast of contributors is much the same as that in the 
campaign reports of the industry-supported Taxpayers for Common Sense. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Coors Brewing Co. is contributing $50,000; Philip Morris USA, 
which has several beer subsidiaries, $60,000; American National Can, $300,000; 
Aluminum Co. of America, $100,000; Jim Beam Brands Co., $41,574; Hiram Walker 
&amp; Sons Inc., $78,598; Joseph E. Seagram, $84,998; Bacardi Corp. and Bacardi 
Imports Inc., $36,640 and Heublein Inc., $53,582. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the voters in November, the anti-tax initiative would go into 
effect immediately. Because of that, it could defeat the nickel-a-drink 
proposal even if that measure passes but fails to win a two-thirds vote. Most 
experts say it would not affect the constitutional amendment supported by the 
liquor industry because revenue from that tax hike is not designated for 
specific purposes. 
</P>
<P>
"What you have is an alliance of people that sort of worship at the altar of 
cutting taxes allied with extremely wealthy industries who are panicked they 
might be subject to democracy," said Schultz. 
</P>
<P>
Kris Vosburgh, executive director of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer Assn., said the 
informal alliance between anti-tax groups and the alcoholic beverage industry 
on this one issue occurred not by design but happenstance. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we would be supported by a group like that," he said, "means 
what we are doing may fit their agenda but that's not why we're doing it." 
</P>
<P>
Vosburgh said his group is trying to address what it sees as a growing and 
dangerous trend toward raising special taxes to pay for specific programs, thus 
taking more and more budget-making flexibility away from the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to strengthen the people's right not to be taxed; otherwise 
groups will continue to be picked off one at a time to fund attractive sounding 
projects and programs with no thought to the overall picture and needs of the 
state," he said.

CITY-STATE MALATHION FEUD HEADS FOR COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ASHLEY DUNN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A battle between the city of Los Angeles and state agricultural officials over 
malathion spraying escalated Friday as the state representatives announced 
plans to spray the downtown area for Mediterranean fruit flies next week and 
city officials vowed to sue to stop the pesticide application. 
</P>
<P>
The opposing positions emerged after a daylong negotiating session intended to 
calm what has developed into the most serious challenge yet to the state's 
right to battle the stubborn Medfly infestation by whatever means necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"The city of Los Angeles means business, and we're not going to jeopardize the 
health of the people," said Councilman Joel Wachs, who has been leading the 
attack on the state's spraying program. "We believe this is of critical 
importance." 
</P>
<P>
The dispute was sparked by the city's claim that it has scientific proof that 
the malathion used in the spraying campaign contains impurities that could pose 
a serious health threat. Wachs said independent tests of malathion samples 
showed quantities of lead, nickel and chromium that violate Proposition 65, a 
state initiative passed in 1986 that imposes restrictions on hazardous 
substances. 
</P>
<P>
State officials were stunned by the city's interpretation of the findings. The 
test results, they said, are nearly identical to their own sampling of 
malathion, and state scientists have reached an opposite conclusion about what 
the results show. 
</P>
<P>
"The numbers our lab got are very low, in fact, lower than that in plain old 
soil," said James W. Stratton, a medical epidemiologist in charge of the state 
Department of Health Services' review of malathion. "There's nothing serious as 
far as we can tell." 
</P>
<P>
The differing scientific interpretation might be resolved only in court. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs said the city intends to seek a court order Monday to stop aerial 
spraying until the state can prove that its mixture of malathion and a syrupy 
fly bait does not violate Proposition 65. 
</P>
<P>
Because all government agencies and private firms with less than 10 employees 
are exempted from Proposition 65, Wachs said the city instead will sue the 
private helicopter company that has been hired to do the spraying. State 
officials have long maintained that the helicopter company also is exempt 
because it is working under contract to the state. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs said that even if the suit fails to stop the spraying, it will at least 
force the state to appear in court and defend its use of malathion again in an 
open forum. 
</P>
<P>
"People want to know that everything has been studied, and the state hasn't 
done that," Wachs said. "That's been the issue all along. How can you have the 
nerve to assure somebody if you haven't done the analysis?" 
</P>
<P>
Roger Lane Carrick, an attorney representing the city, said a formal complaint 
also will be filed with the state attorney general's office concerning a state 
Department of Health Services inspector who allegedly demanded the malathion 
test results earlier this week from the laboratory that conducted the city's 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an extraordinary breach of legal ethics," Carrick said. "It shocks the 
conscience." 
</P>
<P>
State officials were not available for comment on the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
Wachs also called Friday for an independent health risk analysis of the 
malathion spraying. 
</P>
<P>
State Food and Agriculture Director Henry J. Voss said that, despite the city's 
claims, he remains confident that the malathion spraying is safe. 
</P>
<P>
Voss announced late Friday afternoon, even as lawyers for the city and state 
were trying to resolve their differences, that the spraying would start again 
next Thursday over 14 square miles encompassing downtown and several 
surrounding neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Voss had postponed the scheduled spraying until state laboratories had a chance 
to run new tests on malathion samples. 
</P>
<P>
"The Department of Health Services has completed its latest test and, like all 
previous tests, has determined that our malathion spraying program poses no 
public health risk," Voss said. 
</P>
<P>
"The findings we got are not significantly different from other analyses. The 
consistency is there," he said. "We feel comfortable going ahead with 
spraying." 
</P>
<P>
The gaping difference in how the city and state view the pesticide's safety 
lies in their interpretation of the test results. Both sides agree the raw data 
from their tests are virtually the same. 
</P>
<P>
The samples of malathion and fly bait used by the city and the state were taken 
at the same time and from the same source. 
</P>
<P>
The malathion testing stemmed from a city lawsuit filed in February against the 
state to stop the aerial spraying. Samples were taken May 31, but the city's 
results were not available until this week. Voss ordered the spraying postponed 
after Wachs' release earlier this week of the city's test results. 
</P>
<P>
The city has taken the basic numbers showing the amount of lead, chromium and 
nickel in the malathion mixture and used them to conduct an analysis of the 
potential exposure and danger. 
</P>
<P>
To determine the threshold of danger, the city took as its subject a 
hypothetical homeless child who eats all the malathion sprayed in a 
100-square-foot area. 
</P>
<P>
Using those assumptions, Wachs said the child could be exposed to 
concentrations of nickel, lead and chromium exceeding levels allowed under 
Proposition 65. 
</P>
<P>
State officials counter that the city's scenario exceeds even the worst case 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
Stratton, the state scientist in charge of reviewing malathion research, said 
it is unlikely that anyone would end up eating even a tiny amount of the bait 
mixture. The amount inhaled or absorbed through the skin would be even less, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are reaching to find some scenario that squeaks into a Proposition 65 
violation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stratton called the city's interpretation of the test results distorted, 
unrealistic and deceptive. 
</P>
<P>
"They're running this like a carnival, 'Hey! look at our numbers!' ," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Interpreting the test results is further complicated by the lack of detailed 
information on what type of lead, nickel and chromium were found in the 
malathion mixture. 
</P>
<P>
Steven A. Book, chief of the health hazard assessment division of the 
Department of Health Services and the scientist in charge of overseeing 
Proposition 65, said the law is specific in describing controlled substances. 
</P>
<P>
The proposition, which regulates more than 450 chemicals, typically names the 
form of the chemical that is considered hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
For example, only a kind of chromium called hexavalent chromium is regulated by 
the proposition. Similarly, only nickel carbonyl, subsulfide and refinery dust 
fall under the restrictions of the measure. Book said that some forms of 
chromium, for example, are considered safe and are actually found in vitamin 
pills. He said that even if restricted materials are found, determining what 
concentrations are dangerous is a complex process. 
</P>
<P>
The proposition requires that exposure to carcinogenic substances must be kept 
below a level at which there is "no significant risk." Regulators generally 
take the phrase to mean that exposure would cause less than one cancer in 
100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
Levels of birth-defect-causing materials must be 1,000 times less than the 
point where there is an "observable effect" from the substance. 
</P>
<P>
But what exactly is the point of "no significant risk" or "no observable 
effect" in the case of malathion spraying? 
</P>
<P>
Wachs said he believes the city's scenario of a homeless child is a reasonable 
attempt to establish a danger point. 
</P>
<P>
John Emerson, chief deputy city attorney handling the city's lawsuit against 
the state challenging the safety of malathion, said that the burden of proving 
the pesticide's safety now lies with the state and its helicopter contractor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a burden-shifting question," he said. "We're asking the judge, 'Has 
enough evidence been presented that the burden has shifted?' " 
</P>
<P>
Emerson said the city is hoping that a judge on Monday will agree with its 
position and order a halt to the spraying until the issue is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Voss already has stated that if there is proof that malathion is dangerous, "We 
would stop. You just couldn't do otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
But he added that he believes that no such conclusive evidence has been 
presented. 
</P>
<P>
State scientists have said that a week's delay in spraying should not allow the 
Medfly infestation to worsen in the downtown treatment area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MALATHION METALS 
</P>
<P>
Here are some of the biological effects of the three toxic metals that have 
been identified in malathion bait. 
</P>
<P>
Lead: Causes headaches, dizziness, insomnia and, in higher doses, stupor and 
coma. Nervous system damage, particularly in children. 
</P>
<P>
Nickel: Skin irritant. Causes headaches, dizziness, nausea and chest pain. Can 
cause hemorrhage and collapse of the lungs. Causes cancer, particularly lung 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Chromium: Skin irritant. Possibly causes cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Both nickel and chromium are considered essential nutritional elements 
and are required in small quantities in the diet.

YELTSIN WARNS PARTY IT FACES 'HISTORIC DEFEAT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Populist leader Boris N. Yeltsin told the Soviet Communist Party Congress on 
Friday that, after seven decades in power, the party is facing "a historic 
defeat" at the hands of the people unless it democratizes much more and much 
faster than its conservatives have allowed. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, the president of the Russian republic, warned in the strongest terms 
the congress has heard since convening at the start of the week that time has 
run out for traditional communism in the land of its birth. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet people's disillusionment with the party is rapidly turning to anger, 
Yeltsin continued, and they are prepared to vote it out of office or perhaps 
even rise in rebellion, as happened in Eastern Europe last year. 
</P>
<P>
Then, party leaders might find themselves on trial "for the damages they 
brought to the people and the nation," Yeltsin said. 
</P>
<P>
"Events are developing very rapidly," he said. "Any attempt to delay them, as 
some people are dreaming about, will inevitably lead to a full, historic defeat 
for the party. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Those who think about other options should look at the fate of the Communist 
parties in Eastern Europe. They were separated from the people . . . and found 
themselves sidetracked." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin called for the Soviet Communist Party's reorientation along broader, 
socialist lines so that it becomes a "union of democratic forces," rather than 
the political and ideological vanguard of the working class that it now 
proclaims itself. He proposed that it be renamed the "Party of Democratic 
Socialism." 
</P>
<P>
He urged the deliberate development of competing factions within the party 
after a long prohibition, the election of a new leadership on the basis of this 
competition, the drafting of a new party platform and the convening of another 
congress in six months to a year to adopt this program. He also called for the 
withdrawal of party cells from the armed forces, the police and other state 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Directly disputing President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's declaration earlier this 
week that the fate of his restructuring program, perestroika, is at stake in 
the party congress, Yeltsin said, "That question is being decided by people 
outside the walls of this building. It is being decided in the Supreme Soviet 
(the country's legislature). 
</P>
<P>
"What this congress is deciding," Yeltsin continued, "is the fate of the Soviet 
Communist Party itself." 
</P>
<P>
With this approach, sharply different from that outlined earlier to the 
congress by Gorbachev, Yeltsin appeared to be positioning himself more clearly 
than ever as an alternative to Gorbachev as national and party leader without 
directly challenging him. 
</P>
<P>
The nearly 4,700 delegates listened to him intently, but he drew only limited 
applause, much of that coming from the more liberal Moscow and Leningrad party 
delegations. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, now a frequent target for Yeltsin's criticism, told reporters later 
in the day: "I had expected more." 
</P>
<P>
Boris Kustov, the general manager of a Siberian steel mill, called on Gorbachev 
and Yeltsin to work together to pull the country out of its multiple political 
and economic crises. 
</P>
<P>
Describing them as the nation's "manifest leaders," Kustov said that only 
"their joint efforts would stabilize the political situation in the country, 
strengthen confidence in the Soviet Communist Party and rally the various 
trends in the party to accomplish key tasks." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's declaration came as delegates intensified their debate on a complex 
of documents before them -- Gorbachev's report, statements by other members of 
the party's Politburo, plans for the party's reorganization and draft platforms 
-- in anticipation of making far-reaching decisions early next week. 
</P>
<P>
If the party does not democratize broadly and quickly, Yeltsin warned, it would 
probably split into radical and conservative wings "and, sooner or later, it 
will be dropped from the ranks of real political forces of the country." 
</P>
<P>
So far, only the radical Democratic Platform, with about 100 congress votes, 
has threatened to break from the party if its demands for reforms are not met, 
but it appears to be retreating on that, pledging to remain through the 
congress in order to support Gorbachev and then deciding on the basis of 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Lysenko, one of its organizers, said Friday that he thought a split is 
inevitable, but that it would come after the congress. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, once again going against the political grain, said he felt the party 
leadership is placing too much emphasis on party unity, and this gives 
conservatives the power to slow or even stop reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"The actions of conservative forces in the party have not been neutralized in 
recent years -- quite the contrary," he said. "Too much was said to the effect 
that we are all in the same boat, on the same side of the barricades, in a 
single line and share the same thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Such a stand "guaranteed the security" of conservative forces in the party and 
strengthens their confidence that "they can get revenge" on the reformers and 
even reverse perestroika, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The conservative criticism continued throughout the debate Friday, making it 
clear that while Gorbachev may command personal support of the majority of 
delegates, his policies still face strong opposition among them. 
</P>
<P>
Gennady I. Yanayev, the country's top labor leader, attributed much of the 
current crisis to the "romantic" idea, encouraged by Gorbachev and other 
reformers at the start of perestroika, that the nation's problems could be 
resolved in two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
"A dramatic collapse of this illusion is under way now," Yanayev said, 
explaining the deep popular anger that the party faces. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan K. Polozkov, the new first secretary of the Russian Communist Party, said 
that the party leadership over the past five years under Gorbachev has 
"constantly lacked creative purposefulness and practical work, proper 
accountability and personal responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Three rival platforms were presented Friday as alternatives, either in whole or 
in part, to the program put forward by the present party Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Vyacheslav M. Shostakovsky, rector of the Moscow Higher Party School and a 
founder of the Democratic Platform, urged the delegates to "abandon all 
attempts to drive economic activity into an ideological corridor." 
</P>
<P>
"No sacred cow will give us milk or meat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The problems with socialism, he said, are not just in the way it was developed 
in the Soviet Union, which still proudly calls itself "the first country of 
socialism," but in its basic concepts. 
</P>
<P>
Although people had marched willingly under Communist slogans in the 1917 
Bolshevik Revolution and later, Shostakovsky said the party had yet to deliver 
"the land to the peasants, bread to the hungry, the factories to the workers 
and all power to the soviets," the country's governing councils, as it had 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
Alexei A. Sergeyev, a prominent political economist, criticized both the 
Central Committee's program and the Democratic Platform's proposal alike -- the 
first as a creeping re-establishment of capitalism, the second as a 
full-fledged return. 
</P>
<P>
"Both of these plans will lead to a dead end," Sergeyev said in a rousing 
speech, urging a return to traditional but reinvigorated Marxism. "Both of 
these programs will profit only small groups of gifted con artists." 
</P>
<P>
He proposed retaining state ownership and central planning for basic 
industries, only short-term planning for consumer industries and freeing of the 
service sector. He also called for controls on private businesses run as 
cooperatives, fiscal reform and strong governing councils, the soviets 
established after the Bolshevik Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Private businessmen are unlikely to pull the country out of its profound 
economic crisis, Sergeyev said, but a united, well-led party supported by the 
nation's workers and farmers could.

<P>
In their narco-terrorist campaign, cocaine traffickers have frequently targeted 
the Colombian press, with the obvious goal of subduing the country by muzzling 
the media. They appear to be succeeding: After the murders of dozens of 
journalists and threats against the lives of uncounted others, many reporters 
and news organizations are softening their coverage of the drug-trafficking 
Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
"You can see it in the newspapers and you can certainly hear it on the radio," 
a foreign correspondent who lives here said the other day. 
</P>
<P>
A local newspaper editor said, "The professional now thinks twice about what he 
is going to publish, and some try to evade the subject of narcotics traffic." 
</P>
<P>
An investigative reporter said television news programs and the two leading 
radio networks, Caracol and RCN, avoid using the term narco-terrorist and other 
language that might anger traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
Even El Espectador and El Tiempo, major newspapers known in the past for 
hard-hitting reports on drug-related crime and corruption, are assigning fewer 
reporters to investigate these subjects, the reporter said. 
</P>
<P>
This is not to say that the entire Colombian press has caved in to 
narco-terrorists. A few journalists at El Tiempo and El Espectador still defy 
danger to expose the drug lords' activities, and both newspapers still publish 
editorials and opinion columns that take tough stands against the traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing that people speak out as much as they do," said U.S. Embassy 
official Phillip McLean. 
</P>
<P>
Rafael Galvez, president of the Circle of Bogota Journalists, said at least 65 
Colombian journalists have been slain in the past seven years, 29 of those in 
1989. Most were killed by narco-terrorists, Galvez said. He estimated that 20 
journalists now live outside the country because of narco-terrorist threats. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only is the journalist's life in jeopardy, but they menace his children, 
his wife," Galvez said. He said journalists have responded in three ways: 
</P>
<P>
* With courage, defying the drug lords. "This was the position of those who 
were killed," Galvez said. 
</P>
<P>
* With prudence, avoiding many sensitive subjects and softening references to 
drug traffickers. "This is the position of a large number of journalists," 
including those running radio and television networks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
* With a see-no-evil approach, ignoring the subject of drug traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The Circle does not criticize any of the approaches, Galvez said, adding, 
"Everyone is free to administer his own fear." But he voiced concern over the 
threat posed by narco-terrorists to Colombia's traditional freedom of 
information. 
</P>
<P>
"They are not only trying to silence the press, but they also are attempting to 
undermine the institutions of democracy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most dramatic example of the struggle between the Colombian press 
and narco-terrorists is the case of El Espectador. Assassins killed Guillermo 
Cano, the newspaper's editor, in 1986. Police blamed traffickers for Cano's 
death and the deaths of seven other El Espectador employees in the past four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Last September, narco-terrorists bombed the newspaper's Bogota headquarters, 
damaging the plant and injuring 89 people. 
</P>
<P>
In April, traffickers drove El Espectador out of Medellin, Colombia's 
second-largest city and home of the notorious Medellin cocaine cartel. Gunmen 
invaded the newspaper's circulation depot, killing the transportation 
supervisor. Last October, narco-terrorists killed El Espectador's circulation 
and administrative managers. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided that we couldn't continue to risk the lives of our employees, so we 
stopped circulating," said Fernando Cano Busquets, 34, a son of Guillermo Cano 
and now co-editor of the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Cano vowed that the newspaper will continue to speak out forcefully against the 
drug lords and their crimes. "If we don't eradicate that evil from the country, 
the country will get nowhere," he said.

LIBERIAN REBELS SEIZE PORT NEAR DOE'S MANSION

MONROVIA, Liberia

<TEXT>
<P>
Rebels firing heavy artillery attacked the port of Monrovia and fought a sea 
battle Friday near the fortified mansion where Liberian President Samuel K. Doe 
is trying to cling to power with a crumbling army. 
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas moved in to the port, less than 2 miles from Doe's Atlantic beach 
fortress, telling soldiers to surrender, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't die for Doe," rebels told the demoralized and disorganized troops. 
</P>
<P>
One witness said he later saw three carloads of soldiers, dressed in civilian 
clothes, returning to central Monrovia, a city on a peninsula joined to the 
port by two bridges. 
</P>
<P>
Plumes of smoke from explosions rose from the city outskirts, and automatic 
rifle and artillery fire echoed across the besieged capital from dawn until 
noon. 
</P>
<P>
A rebel fishing trawler fired at a coast guard cutter about 5 miles offshore. 
The trawler, which hijacked a shipload of rice for the rebels Sunday, then gave 
chase, firing again before disappearing over the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, which has offered to evacuate Doe, supplied water to his 
mansion under heavy Marine guard. Four American vehicles, with black tinted 
windows, escorted a water tanker to the mansion, a witness said. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who invaded from Ivory Coast six months ago, now control all land 
routes out of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
Doe, who seized power in 1980, has declined a U.S. offer to help him leave 
Liberia as rebels led by his former associate, Charles Taylor, tighten their 
grip on Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
Doe has offered to resign, on condition that his safety and that of his 
minority Krahn tribe is guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has a task force of 2,300 Marines and four Navy ships off the coast 
to evacuate foreigners if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Monrovia's 500,000 people spent much of Friday searching for food and carrying 
buckets of water from dwindling wells. The capital has been without water for 
nine days and without electricity for a week. 
</P>
<P>
Most shops and markets have been closed since Monday and some people have been 
begging for food, or foraging for leaves to eat from waste ground.

Philippine Communist guerrillas will free a kidnaped U.S. Peace Corps volunteer 
and a Japanese aid worker unharmed and without ransom within the month, a 
purported rebel spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A man who identified himself as a commander of the New People's Army told 
Philippine reporters by telephone that NPA troops are holding Timothy Swanson, 
of Cheyenne, Wyo., and Fumio Mizuno, of the Japanese Organization for 
Industrial, Spiritual and Cultural Advancement, at a jungle camp in the 
mountains of Negros Island. 
</P>
<P>
"They are safe. We will turn them over within the month," he said, adding that 
any military rescue attempts "might endanger their lives." 
</P>
<P>
The caller identified himself as "Ka (Comrade) Efren," and said he headed the 
island's NPA regional command. Neither his identity nor his ties to the 
abductors could be independently confirmed. A transcript of his call was 
released in Manila. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official here said, however, that the call was consistent with previous 
NPA operations, and appeared reliable. He said the guerrillas apparently were 
responding to widespread criticism over kidnaping aid workers, who are 
generally popular in the Philippines. "What this statement says is it was a 
mistake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Swanson, 26, was abducted June 13 from the village of Patag. Mizuno, 36, was 
taken May 29 at a nearby silkworm farm. Both men worked in forest and farming 
projects on Negros, about 300 miles south-southeast of Manila, and are married 
to Filipina women. 
</P>
<P>
Citing NPA threats, the Peace Corps announced the evacuation of all 261 
volunteers from the Philippines last week, indefinitely ending one of the 
largest and oldest Peace Corps programs. But U.S. officials said they learned 
of Swanson's abduction only after they began the evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
Retired Roman Catholic Bishop Antonio Fortich, who has close contacts with the 
Negros rebels, said Friday that he is optimistic that the NPA will free the two 
aid workers shortly. 
</P>
<P>
"The two men are good gentlemen who have not committed human rights crimes 
against the people," Fortich said in a phone interview from Bacolod, provincial 
capital in Negros. "There is no reason for the NPA to prolong their stay." 
</P>
<P>
Fortich said the NPA, which has fought a 21-year insurgency, considers foreign 
aid workers potential targets because "they offer the people a better way of 
life. That is a threat to the NPA." 
</P>
<P>
Edgar B. Uytiepo, a Bacolod attorney who is negotiating for Mizuno's release, 
said Mizuno's abductors "suspected him of feeding information to the military. 
They had a trial, and he proved himself innocent." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking in both English and Tagalog, the caller said the NPA "invited" the two 
foreigners to "dialogue" with NPA leaders because of suspicions that they and 
their organizations were involved in government counterinsurgency operations. 
</P>
<P>
"We did not harm them because we believe they were not conscious of what they 
were involved in," the caller said. He described Swanson as "an American 
rah-rah, ready to spread goodwill, not knowing he was being used in an evil 
scheme." 
</P>
<P>
"Even if they are guilty, we will spare them this time," he said. "But we will 
not be so kind the next time."

North Korea offered Friday to open a small stretch of its border to promote 
unification with South Korea, but its capitalist rival dismissed the gesture as 
insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang announced that it would open the northern sector of Panmunjom, a 
border village, on Aug. 15, according to Naewoe Press, a semi-official South 
Korean news agency. 
</P>
<P>
North Korea said opening the area, about 800 yards long and 500 yards wide, is 
intended to promote unification of the Korean peninsula. It urged South Korea 
to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
The opening, however, would not permit foreigners to travel past the perimeter 
of Panmunjom, a truce village that straddles part of the 155-mile border 
between the two Koreas. The village is jointly controlled by North Korea and a 
U.N. Command.

LONDON DECLARATION: 'WALLS THAT ONCE CONFINED PEOPLE, IDEAS ARE COLLAPSING'

Following is the text of the London Declaration on a Transformed North Atlantic 
Alliance issued by heads of state and government participating in the meeting 
here July 5-6 of the North Atlantic Council: 
</P>
<P>
1. Europe has entered a new, promising era. Central and Eastern Europe is 
liberating itself. The Soviet Union has embarked on the long journey toward a 
free society. The walls that once confined people and ideas are collapsing. 
Europeans are determining their own destiny. They are choosing freedom. They 
are choosing economic liberty. They are choosing peace. They are choosing a 
Europe whole and free. As a consequence, this alliance must and will adapt. 
</P>
<P>
2. The North Atlantic Alliance has been the most successful defensive alliance 
in history. As our alliance enters its fifth decade and looks ahead to a new 
century, it must continue to provide for the common defense. This alliance has 
done much to bring about the new Europe. No one, however, can be certain of the 
future. We need to keep standing together, to extend the long peace we have 
enjoyed these past four decades. Yet our alliance must be even more an agent of 
change. It can help build the structures of a more united continent, supporting 
security and stability with the strength of our shared faith in democracy, the 
rights of the individual, and the peaceful resolution of disputes. We reaffirm 
that security and stability do not lie solely in the military dimension, and we 
intend to enhance the political component of our alliance as provided for by 
Article 2 of our Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
3. The unification of Germany means that the division of Europe is also being 
overcome. A united Germany in the Atlantic Alliance of free democracies and 
part of the growing political and economic integration of the European 
Community will be an indispensable factor of stability, which is needed in the 
heart of Europe. The move within the European Community towards political 
union, including the development of a European identity in the domain of 
security, will also contribute to Atlantic solidarity and to the establishment 
of a just and lasting order of peace throughout the whole of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
4. We recognize that, in the new Europe, the security of every state is 
inseparably linked to the security of its neighbors. NATO must become an 
institution where Europeans, Canadians and Americans work together not only for 
the common defense, but to build new partnerships with all the nations of 
Europe. The Atlantic Community must reach out to the countries of the East, 
which were our adversaries in the Cold War, and extend to them the hand of 
friendship. 
</P>
<P>
5. We will remain a defensive alliance and will continue to defend all the 
territory of all of our members. We have no aggressive intentions and we commit 
ourselves to the peaceful resolution of all disputes. We will never in any 
circumstances be the first to use force. 
</P>
<P>
6. The member states of the North Atlantic Alliance propose to the member 
states of the Warsaw Treaty Organization a joint declaration in which we 
solemnly state that we are no longer adversaries and reaffirm our intention to 
refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or 
political independence of any state, or from acting in any other manner 
inconsistent with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and 
with the CSCE (the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe) 
Final Act. We invite all other CSCE member states to join us in this commitment 
to nonaggression. 
</P>
<P>
7. In that spirit, and to reflect the changing political role of the alliance, 
we today invited President (Mikhail S.) Gorbachev on behalf of the Soviet 
Union, and representatives of the other Central and Eastern European countries 
to come to Brussels and address the North Atlantic Council. We today also 
invite the governments of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Czech 
and Slovak Federal Republic, the Hungarian Republic, the Republic of Poland, 
the People's Republic of Bulgaria and Romania to come to NATO, not just to 
visit, but to establish regular diplomatic liaison with NATO. This will make it 
possible for us to share with them our thinking and deliberations in this 
historic period of change. 
</P>
<P>
8. Our alliance will do its share to overcome the legacy of decades of 
suspicion. We are ready to intensify military contacts, including those of NATO 
military commanders, with Moscow and other Central and Eastern European 
capitals. 
</P>
<P>
9. We welcome the invitation to NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner to visit 
Moscow and meet with Soviet leaders. 
</P>
<P>
10. Military leaders from throughout Europe gathered earlier this year in 
Vienna to talk about their forces and doctrine. NATO proposes another such 
meeting this Autumn to promote common understanding. We intend to establish an 
entirely different quality of openness in Europe, including an agreement on 
"Open Skies." 
</P>
<P>
11. The significant presence of North American conventional and U.S. nuclear 
forces in Europe demonstrates the underlying political compact that binds North 
America's fate to Europe's democracies. But, as Europe changes, we must 
profoundly alter the way we think about defense. 
</P>
<P>
12. To reduce our military requirements, sound arms control agreements are 
essential. That is why we put the highest priority on completing this year the 
first treaty to reduce and limit conventional armed forces in Europe (CFE) 
along with the completion of a meaningful CSBM (confidence-building measures) 
package. These talks should remain in continuous session until the work is 
done. Yet we hope to go further. We propose that, once a CFE Treaty is signed, 
follow-on talks should begin with the same membership and mandate, with the 
goal of building on the current agreement with additional measures, including 
measures to limit manpower in Europe. With this goal in mind, a commitment will 
be given at the time of signature of the CFE Treaty concerning the manpower 
levels of a unified Germany. 
</P>
<P>
13. Our objective will be to conclude the negotiations on the follow-on to CFE 
and CSBMs as soon as possible and looking to the follow-up meeting of the CSCE 
to be held in Helsinki in 1992. We will seek through new conventional arms 
control negotiations, within the CSCE framework, further far-reaching measures 
in the 1990s to limit the offensive capability of conventional armed forces in 
Europe, so as to prevent any nation from maintaining disproportionate military 
power on the Continent. NATO's High Level Task Force will formulate a detailed 
position for these follow-on conventional arms control talks. We will make 
provisions as needed for different regions to redress disparities and to ensure 
that no one's security is harmed at any stage. Furthermore, we will continue to 
explore broader arms control and confidence-building opportunities. This is an 
ambitious agenda, but it matches our goal: enduring peace in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
14. As Soviet troops leave Eastern Europe and a treaty limiting conventional 
armed forces is implemented, the alliance's integrated force structure and its 
strategy will change fundamentally to include the following elements: 
</P>
<P>
NATO will field smaller and restructured active forces. These forces will be 
highly mobile and versatile so that Allied leaders will have maximum 
flexibility in deciding how to respond to a crisis. It will rely increasingly 
on multinational corps made up of national units. 
</P>
<P>
NATO will scale back the readiness of its active units, reducing training 
requirements and the number of exercises. 
</P>
<P>
NATO will rely more heavily on the ability to build up larger forces if and 
when they might be needed. 
</P>
<P>
15. To keep the peace, the alliance must maintain for the foreseeable future an 
appropriate mix of nuclear and conventional forces, based in Europe, and kept 
up to date where necessary. But, as a defensive alliance, NATO has always 
stressed that none of its weapons will ever be used except in self-defense and 
that we seek the lowest and most stable level of nuclear forces needed to 
secure the prevention of war. 
</P>
<P>
16. The political and military changes in Europe, and the prospects of further 
changes, now allow the Allies concerned to go further. They will thus modify 
the size and adapt the tasks of their nuclear deterrent forces. They have 
concluded that, as a result of the new political and military conditions in 
Europe, there will be a significantly reduced role for sub-strategic nuclear 
systems of the shortest range. They have decided specifically that, once 
negotiations begin on short-range nuclear forces, the alliance will propose, in 
return for reciprocal action by the Soviet Union, the elimination of all its 
nuclear artillery shells from Europe. 
</P>
<P>
17. New negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union on the 
reduction of short-range nuclear forces should begin shortly after a CFE 
agreement is signed. The Allies concerned will develop an arms control 
framework for these negotiations which takes into account our requirements for 
far fewer nuclear weapons, and the diminished need for sub-strategic nuclear 
systems of the shortest range. 
</P>
<P>
18. Finally, with the total withdrawal of Soviet stationed forces and the 
implementation of a CFE agreement, the Allies can reduce their reliance on 
nuclear weapons. These will continue to fulfill an essential role in the 
overall strategy of the alliance to prevent war by ensuring that there are no 
circumstances in which nuclear retaliation in response to military action might 
be discounted. However, in the transformed Europe, they will be able to adopt a 
new NATO strategy making nuclear forces truly weapons of last resort. 
</P>
<P>
19. We approve the mandate given in Turnberry to the North Atlantic Council in 
Permanent Session to oversee the ongoing work on the adaptation of the alliance 
to the new circumstances. It should report its conclusions as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
20. In the context of these revised plans for defense and arms control, and 
with the advice of NATO military authorities and all member states concerned, 
NATO will prepare a new allied military strategy moving away from "forward 
defense," where appropriate, towards a reduced forward presence and modifying 
"flexible response" to reflect a reduced reliance on nuclear weapons. In that 
connection, NATO will elaborate new force plans consistent with the 
revolutionary changes in Europe. NATO will also provide a forum for allied 
consultations on the upcoming negotiations on short-range nuclear forces. 
</P>
<P>
21. The Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) should become 
more prominent in Europe's future, bringing together the countries of Europe 
and North America. We support a CSCE summit later this year in Paris which 
would include the signature of a CFE agreement and would set new standards for 
the establishment, and preservation, of free societies. It should endorse, 
inter alia: 
</P>
<P>
CSCE principles on the right to free and fair elections 
</P>
<P>
CSCE commitments to respect and uphold the rule of law 
</P>
<P>
CSCE guidelines for enhancing economic cooperation, based on the development of 
free and competitive market economies; and 
</P>
<P>
CSCE cooperation on environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
22. We further propose that the CSCE summit in Paris decide how the CSCE can be 
institutionalized to provide a forum for wider political dialogue in a more 
united Europe. We recommend that CSCE governments establish: 
</P>
<P>
a program for regular consultations among member governments at the Heads of 
State and Government or ministerial level, at least once each year, with other 
periodic meetings of officials to prepare for and follow up on these 
consultations; 
</P>
<P>
a schedule of CSCE review conferences once every two years to assess progress 
toward a Europe whole and free; 
</P>
<P>
a small CSCE secretariat to coordinate these meetings and conferences; 
</P>
<P>
a CSCE mechanism to monitor elections in all the CSCE countries, on the basis 
of the Copenhagen document 
</P>
<P>
a CSCE Center for the Prevention of Conflict that might serve as a forum for 
exchanges of military information, discussion of unusual military activities, 
and the conciliation of disputes involving CSCE member states; and 
</P>
<P>
a CSCE parliamentary body, the Assembly of Europe, to be based on the existing 
parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe, in Strasbourg, and include 
representatives of all CSCE member states. 
</P>
<P>
The sites of these new institutions should reflect the fact that the newly 
democratic countries of Central and Eastern Europe form part of the political 
structures of the new Europe. 
</P>
<P>
23. Today, our alliance begins a major transformation. Working with all the 
countries of Europe, we are determined to create enduring peace on this 
Continent.

After surviving for 15 years without so much as a telephone to call its own, 
the once-scorned Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe was tapped 
Friday by its 16 most powerful members to become the continent's primary 
organization for East-West cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued at the end of its London summit conference, the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization called for transformation of the conference into a 
permanent organization, with its own headquarters and bureaucracy, to promote 
free elections and the rule of law, especially in the emerging democracies in 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The NATO heads of government said the conference, known by the acronym CSCE, 
should be "institutionalized to provide a forum for wider political dialogue in 
a more united Europe." 
</P>
<P>
The summit suggested creation of a new parliament, to be known as the Assembly 
of Europe, that would include representatives of all member nations of the 
conference. It suggested that the new body should be headquartered in one of 
the new democracies that have replaced the Communist regimes of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Support from NATO, which constitutes almost half of the conference's 35-nation 
membership, virtually guarantees an enhancement of the role and powers of the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union advocates an even wider mandate for the conference. It 
advocates converting the conference into a continent-wide security alliance, 
supplanting both NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The United States and its allies are 
strongly opposed to going that far because they want to maintain NATO intact. 
</P>
<P>
The conference, often called the Helsinki process because it first met 15 years 
ago in the Finnish capital, is the only European organization to straddle the 
ideological divisions of the Cold War successfully. Its membership includes the 
United States, Canada and all of the nations of Europe except for isolationist 
Albania. 
</P>
<P>
Although the conference has met frequently over the years, it has never had a 
permanent structure, relying on employees of the various host countries to 
handle administrative chores. 
</P>
<P>
The NATO communique emphasized the political role of an enhanced conference, by 
implication rejecting Moscow's plan for a new security structure. It said the 
conference should "set new standards for the establishment and preservation of 
free societies." 
</P>
<P>
The communique called on the conference to set up "a mechanism to monitor 
elections in all CSCE countries." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it proposed establishment of a "Center for the Prevention of 
Conflict that might serve as a forum for exchange of military information . . . 
and the conciliation of disputes involving CSCE member states." 
</P>
<P>
NATO called for at least one CSCE meeting a year attended either by presidents 
and prime ministers or by foreign ministers. 
</P>
<P>
The first CSCE meeting in 1975 ratified the post-World War II boundaries of 
Europe. At the time, it was denounced by conservatives as putting a stamp of 
approval on the permanent division of the conflict into democratic and 
Communist segments. However, the conference also adopted sweeping human rights 
standards that are now believed to have energized the anti-Communist revolution 
that swept across Eastern Europe last year. 
</P>
<P>
The United States once was so unenthusiastic about the conference that 
then-President Gerald R. Ford considered skipping the final session of that 
first meeting. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Secretary of State James A. Baker III has endorsed a larger role 
for the conference, although he said the organization was too cumbersome to 
take on important security functions. 
</P>
<P>
Under existing procedures, the conference can only act if it has unanimous 
approval of the 35 members, including such mini-states as Malta and the 
Vatican.

BAKER SENDS LETTER TO LEVY URGING U.S.-ISRAEL TALKS; 
</P>
<P>
MIDEAST: A MEETING WOULD BE THE FIRST HIGH-LEVEL CONTACT IN MORE THAN FOUR 
MONTHS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.

<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III has sent a letter to new Foreign Minister 
David Levy, inviting the Israeli official to meet with him soon, Foreign 
Ministry officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the two senior officials would be the first high-level contact in 
more than four months between the two countries, whose relations have been 
increasingly strained over the lack of progress in the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli newspapers reported that Baker suggested in the letter he is willing to 
meet with Levy, who became foreign minister last month, on July 17 in Paris 
during German unification talks. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand you are the type of person who solves problems," Baker wrote, 
according to the Hebrew daily Yediot Ahronot. "We must meet very soon." 
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry official denied a date for meeting was mentioned and 
described the letter as a "goodwill" message with "an invitation to meet soon, 
but no specific date." 
</P>
<P>
The time of a meeting also would depend on the health of the foreign minister, 
who is still recovering from a heart attack he suffered three weeks ago, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Baker letter, described as "very warm and friendly," was delivered Thursday 
to Levy by the U.S. ambassador to Israel, William A. Brown, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Yediot Ahronot also reported that Israel recently sent messages to Washington 
saying it would agree to negotiations with Palestinians from the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip without checking their allegiances. 
The messages indicated a willingness to talk to supporters of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization, but not PLO members. 
</P>
<P>
In London, meanwhile, President Bush said Friday he will resume talks with the 
Palestine Liberation Organization if it condemns a guerrilla raid on Israel and 
punishes the plot's mastermind. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring he wanted to revive Middle East peace efforts, Bush said that if the 
PLO responds to his request, he will urgently consider renewing a dialogue that 
had been useful. 
</P>
<P>
"What I want to see is the peace process go forward," Bush told a news 
conference at the end of a two-day North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit. 
</P>
<P>
But PLO officials in Tunis, Tunisia, said they see nothing new in Bush's 
restatement of conditions for resuming talks with the organization. 
</P>
<P>
The United States halted the 18-month dialogue last month, saying PLO leader 
Yasser Arafat had failed to condemn the May 30 guerrilla attack on Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The action was taken after an attempted raid by members of a radical PLO 
faction, led by Abul Abbas, against Israeli beaches. Israel charged that this 
was an example of how the PLO remains committed to "terrorism" despite public 
statements to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
The Baker letter to Levy is the latest message in a series of letters between 
the two countries since Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir formed a right-wing 
coalition government June 11, when Levy moved from the Housing Ministry to the 
Foreign Ministry.

ETHNIC RELATIONS IN MIAMI UNRAVEL AS ARGUMENT OVER PANTS ERUPTS INTO VIOLENCE; 
</P>
<P>
RACIAL STRIFE: TENSIONS FLARE BETWEEN THE CUBAN MAJORITY AND HAITIANS UPSET BY 
THEIR TREATMENT. A BLOODY FIGHT WITH POLICE HAS ANGERED MANY.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Haitian says the Cuban threw the first punch, and the Cuban says it was the 
Haitian. Whatever the truth, a dispute about alterations to a pair of pants has 
torn apart the tenuous seams of ethnic peace in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Just as the Haitian got the worst of the fistfight, the Haitian community here 
feels it inevitably gets the worst of things from the powers-that-be, whether 
from city officials, police or the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Miami simmered. Haitians planned a weekend of protests, this time not 
just against the Cuban-owned clothing store where the original fracas took 
place on June 29, but against the police, who crushed a demonstration at the 
shopping plaza where the store is situated. 
</P>
<P>
There had been demonstrations all week at the shopping plaza. Then, on 
Thursday, in full riot gear and with TV cameras rolling live for the evening 
news, police arrested 62 Haitians, clubbing some of them bloody with 
nightsticks. 
</P>
<P>
Many observers were horrified. To them, the protest had seemed generally 
peaceful, if illegal. The local NAACP called for a federal civil rights 
investigation. Attorneys for the Haitians threatened to sue. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the Miami police department insisted that the officers had had no 
choice. Chief Perry Anderson said that some of the crowd had rushed the 
barricades. 
</P>
<P>
"Police were trying to maintain control after days of extreme abuse . . . days 
of being pelted . . . " said Anderson, who had personally tried to calm the 
protesters several times. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those arrested were locked up for the night and charged with the 
misdemeanor of unlawful assembly. But others -- those suspected of being 
illegal aliens -- were sent to the federal immigration authority's Krome 
Detention Center west of the city. Five still remain there, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 90,000 Haitians in Miami, a usually docile population that only 
in recent years has begun to raise its collective voice. Now, there is fury in 
the words. "Instead of justice we have powerful fascists who can apply their 
pressure on the police department," the Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste complained. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke Friday at the Haitian Refugee Center. Before him was a banner 
condemning "police brutality." And at his side were many of those who had been 
arrested. A few yanked up their shirts and displayed the bruises. 
</P>
<P>
Pierre Vancol, a husky 46-year-old laborer, said that his wife had sent him to 
the grocery to buy juice. He was talking with a friend at the shopping area 
when squads of police officers descended on the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"They pushed me right over, and, after I fell, they hit me with the sticks and 
jabbed me, there, there, there," he said, his fingers moving about. 
</P>
<P>
Vancol then folded back his upper lip to show a row of fresh stitches. He took 
from his pocket a small envelope that held a broken dental plate. 
</P>
<P>
"The police call us damn Haitians and hit and hit," said another of those 
arrested, Wilder Cheri, a 24-year-old with his two young children nearby. 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, these events are an odd turn; many Haitian and Cuban leaders 
emphasize that there is no deep enmity between the two peoples. 
</P>
<P>
"We have enjoyed warm relations for years," the Rev. Fritz Bazin said. "We are 
close culturally, in music, in food, even in superstitions." 
</P>
<P>
But the current discontent began with a Cuban and a Haitian at loggerheads -- 
and ever since it has carried the tinge of ethnic resentments. 
</P>
<P>
Cuban Luis Reyes owns the Rapid Transit Factory Outlet, a clothing store in a 
busy shopping center not far from the neighborhood known as Little Haiti. He 
has been there five years and says 80% of his clientele is Haitian. 
</P>
<P>
One of those Haitian customers, Abner Alezi, 44, came to pick up a pair of 
pants on June 29 and ended up in a scuffle after demanding that they be hemmed. 
</P>
<P>
Accounts conflict about who started the fight and how many took part, but Alezi 
emerged from the store with a cut face. A small crowd gathered. 
</P>
<P>
Policemen came to sort it out, and the officers said that, when they ordered 
the injured Haitian to leave, he refused. They arrested him for trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
News of the episode quickly was spread by a Haitian radio station, and the 
broadcast left little doubt as to whom the station presumed had been wronged. 
</P>
<P>
Two hundred angry people gathered. The next day, there were even more. When 
stones and bottles crashed against the store, Reyes lowered protective metal 
shutters over his windows. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, he was a prisoner in his own business until policemen sneaked him 
out through a back door. The Cuban then decided to let things cool down before 
reopening. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Reyes' cause lit passions on Cuban talk radio. Callers wanted 
to know how police could let an honest shopkeeper be driven out of business. 
And they were not alone. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the Miami City Commission is Cuban, as is much of the city 
itself. People expressed impatience. The early strategy of police restraint no 
longer seemed reasonable. How long would this "mob" be allowed to rule? 
</P>
<P>
Reyes opened again on Thursday. Soon, 100 or so Haitians assembled. By then, 
however, the city had made a decision to get tough. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to respond to crimes," Commissioner Miriam Alonso said. 
</P>
<P>
But the brass-knuckles approach, just like the earlier scuffle over a pair of 
pants, seemed to the Haitian community another symptom of racism and abuse. 
"Alezi was just the drop that made the bucket overflow," attorney Phillip 
Brutus said. 
</P>
<P>
For years, Haitians have complained of a double standard in U.S. immigration 
policy, protesting that Cubans arrive in inner tubes and are welcomed to 
America, but Haitians come aboard rickety sailboats and are either sent back or 
locked up in a detention camp. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Haitians have marched to protest federal rules that bar them from 
donating blood because of the high incidence of AIDS among them. 
</P>
<P>
"We see ourselves as victims," Bazin said. "And in Miami it certainly did not 
help when our Cuban leaders refused to welcome Nelson Mandela" on June 28, 
complaining that he had befriended Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
The Haitians have now applied for a city permit to begin demonstrations once 
again in front of the Rapid Transit Factory Outlet. On Friday, as plans were 
made and other rallies held, the store itself was quiet. 
</P>
<P>
Reyes opened up and warily watched the door. Once, the Cuban owner ventured 
outside to talk things over with a single Haitian handing out leaflets. 
</P>
<P>
"What the police did was a disgrace," the Haitian said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but are you aware that my life was in danger?" Reyes asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, but why did you assault a Haitian citizen?" 
</P>
<P>
"It was the other way around." 
</P>
<P>
"No, it wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes." 
</P>
<P>
"No." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes." 
</P>
<P>
"No."

STRICT LOUISIANA ANTI-ABORTION MEASURE VETOED BUT HOUSE SUPPORTS AN OVERRIDE;

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer Friday vetoed what has been called the strictest 
anti-abortion bill in the nation, setting the stage for a fight to override his 
action in the Legislature, which is scheduled to adjourn on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The Louisiana House of Representatives on Friday night voted 73 to 31 to 
override the veto. Senators voted 21 to 18 to adjourn late Friday rather than 
vote on an override. 
</P>
<P>
For an override, legislators needed at least 70 votes in the House and 26 votes 
in the Senate. When the bill, sponsored by state Rep. Louis (Woody) Jenkins of 
Baton Rouge, went through the Senate on June 14, it was passed by only 24 votes 
-- two less than the number required to override. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Allen Bares conceded on the floor Friday that the bill's backers did not 
have the 26 votes needed to override. The adjournment gave abortion opponents 
three days to lobby the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The bill allows abortions only to save the mother's life. A person who 
performed an abortion for any other reason could be sent to jail for 10 years 
and fined $100,000 under the measure. Roemer, a Democrat, objected that the 
bill did not allow abortions in cases of rape and incest. 
</P>
<P>
At an impromptu news conference, the governor said he had vetoed the bill 
earlier in the day but made no other comment. 
</P>
<P>
Although his veto message will not be made public until legislators officially 
receive it, Roemer last week said that "if we cannot give some credence and 
faith and hope and constructive opportunity to the victims of these crimes 
(rape and incest) . . . " he would not sign the bill. 
</P>
<P>
No gubernatorial veto in Louisiana has been overridden by lawmakers in more 
than 65 years, and some legislators and political observers here say 
anti-abortion lawmakers may have made a crucial error in insisting on the 
strongest possible bill. 
</P>
<P>
"They could have had an anti-abortion bill passed by now if they had agreed to 
the exceptions," said Rep. James Cain of Dry Creek, a conservative Democrat 
opposed to abortion. "Now it may mean that we'll have no bill at all." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans, who said he opposed the measure because it 
could provide for the criminal prosecution of women who seek abortions, said 
abortion opponents "led their flock off of a cliff." 
</P>
<P>
"They knew from the beginning that, if the rape and incest exceptions weren't 
added, the bill would be vetoed and that they probably didn't have enough votes 
for an override," Landrieu, a Democrat, said. "They were irresponsible, and I 
think they let a lot of their followers down by pursuing a faulty strategy." 
</P>
<P>
The idea of overriding, and thus embarrassing Roemer, who still has a high 
personal popularity rating statewide, has reportedly served to intimidate some 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's been an erosion in their numbers because of their strategy," 
said Landrieu. 
</P>
<P>
Added Susan Howell, a political pollster with the University of New Orleans: 
"They didn't play this thing right, but it seems that Roemer did. He staked out 
his position of being anti-abortion except in the cases of rape and incest, and 
he made it clear that he would veto a bill not including these exceptions." 
</P>
<P>
Howell said Roemer's position "let the Legislature off the hook. Now Louisiana 
doesn't have to pay for a long legal fight that would go all the way to the 
U.S. Supreme Court, which it could ill afford. Legislators can say that they 
voted for the toughest anti-abortion bill in the nation, but somehow it just 
didn't work out." 
</P>
<P>
Despite criticism of their strategy, Democratic Sen. Mike Cross, who led the 
fight for the anti-abortion bill, said he was opposed all along to any 
exceptions to a strong bill. Cross said he was for a "tough bill or nothing" 
and added that there is "still a chance we can override. I'm not predicting it, 
but it will be close."

A judge Friday placed a Christian Science couple on 10 years' probation for 
denying medical care to their dying son and ordered periodic medical 
examinations for their other children. 
</P>
<P>
The couple, convicted of manslaughter in their son's death, said they would 
comply with the order. 
</P>
<P>
"We always tried to obey the law . . . and we'll try to obey the judge's 
instructions," David Twitchell said after he and his wife, Ginger, were 
sentenced by Suffolk Superior Court Judge Sandra Hamlin. 
</P>
<P>
The Twitchells, lifelong Christian Scientists, were convicted by a jury 
Wednesday of recklessly and wantonly causing the death of their 2 1/2-year-old 
son Robyn by relying solely on prayer to heal the boy. Robyn died on April 8, 
1986, and an autopsy showed he had suffered from a congenital defect that 
caused a bowel obstruction. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Hamlin placed the Twitchells, who had faced up to 20 years in 
prison, on probation and said that they must take their three children for 
periodic health checkups under guidelines for children set by the American 
Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
She said a doctor should be called at "any signs of serious illness" in the 
children -- Elias, 9 months old, Brian, 2 years old, and Jeremy, 8. 
</P>
<P>
Hamlin asked for monthly reports and said she would call for an immediate 
hearing if conditions are violated. 
</P>
<P>
Hamlin denied a defense motion to stay the sentence pending the outcome of an 
appeal, which was filed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyer Steve Lyons said Friday that the defense would appeal that 
denial next week. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement after the sentencing, Twitchell said that, although he 
would obey the judge's order, he would "always pray first" for his children's 
health. 
</P>
<P>
Special prosecutor John Kiernan had asked for a "very lengthy" period of 
probation for the Twitchells, who now live in Brentwood, N.Y., periodic medical 
checkups of their children and that the couple perform community service 
"designed to benefit young children."

The husband of a woman killed in last week's fiercely destructive brush fire 
said Friday he is trying to raise money for a foundation dedicated to teaching 
the public about fire safety. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Gurka said he hopes the memory of his wife, Andrea Lang Gurka -- the 
only person to die in the Santa Barbara blaze -- will live on through the 
Phoenix Center, a proposed clearinghouse for information on topics ranging from 
building fire-retardant homes to preventing soil erosion after fires. 
</P>
<P>
Gurka, 36, said he has approached private investors as well as political and 
religious leaders in the community for support of the center, which he 
estimates will cost about $100,000 to establish. He intends to discuss plans 
for the project today during a fire-relief telethon in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to find some meaning in this," said Gurka, dark circles of fatigue 
underlining his eyes. "If we can educate people about fire, then potential 
human life won't be lost." 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Lang Gurka, 37, died sometime after 6 p.m. on June 27 as she tried to 
flee the fire roaring toward the Gurkas' house at the bottom of a canyon in the 
1700 block of San Marcos Pass Road. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Gurka, an architectural and landscape consultant, said his wife saw the 
approaching flames and called him at his Montecito office to discuss possible 
escape routes. Her car had broken down the day before, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The couple decided she should try to get a ride with neighbors, or run out on 
foot. If that failed they agreed that Andrea Gurka, who had lost mobility from 
two sprained ankles in the past year, would take shelter in the lowest, coolest 
area possible -- a dry creek bed that ran close to their house. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Gurka said his wife called back within minutes to say she could not 
reach any neighbors, and he started a desperate drive home through streets 
clogged with traffic. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he got there, police barricades were up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He alerted authorities to his wife's predicament. The next day, he searched the 
ruins of the house and made the rounds of evacuation shelters. 
</P>
<P>
That night, Gurka filed a missing person report. A search team sent by the 
Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department found her body at 9:30 a.m. Friday, 
June 29, in the creek bed about 75 yards from the house, Deputy Tim Gracey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying not to concentrate on what could have been," Michael Gurka said, 
closing his eyes and furrowing his forehead. "I've been advised not to blame 
myself, and I'm working on that now." 
</P>
<P>
The Gurkas met in 1976 in New York City, where they were teachers at a private 
school. They married two years later and soon moved to California to live 
closer to nature, Gurka said. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Barbara home in which they had lived since 1985 is now a pile of 
charred rubble. Also consumed by the fire were about 1,000 watercolors painted 
by Andrea Gurka and two dozen unpublished children's books she had written. 
</P>
<P>
Gurka, described by relatives as a kind and energetic woman, grew up in New 
York, appearing with her mother, actress Doe Lang, on soap operas as a child. 
She attended the New York High School of Performing Arts and studied at the 
American Conservatory Theatre in San Francisco as a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
But her true love was art, Michael Gurka said. He said she worked as a 
free-lance illustrator for the New York Times from 1977-78 and for the Los 
Angeles Times between 1980 and 1982. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Gurka spent her days painting fanciful watercolors of the wild 
animals that she fed every day. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Gurka said he and his wife had decided to put their relationship before 
their careers. 
</P>
<P>
"I really, really loved my wife," he said. "I can't see not structuring my life 
in dedication for what she stood for."

TEMPLE ACHIEVES MEASURE OF PEACE IN HACIENDA HEIGHTS

<P>
Man Tao, 35, a Buddhist nun from Malaysia, slowly enunciated the foreign words: 
"Como esta usted?" 
</P>
<P>
"Como se llama?" 
</P>
<P>
She giggled shyly while taking a break from welcoming a steady stream of 
visitors to the Hacienda Heights temple and bowed her shaved head after 
demonstrating what she had learned in three months of Spanish classes at Hsi 
Lai Temple. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps one day I'll have the chance to connect with the Spanish-speaking 
people and give them the Buddha's teaching," Man Tao said. 
</P>
<P>
A collection of awe-struck sightseers, devout worshipers and curious passers-by 
is a common sight to Man Tao and the 30 other nuns and monks-in-residence at 
the monastery, the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere and one of 
more than 50 branches of Fo Kuang Shan, Taiwan's predominant Buddhist 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
"Beautiful," sighed Husteon (Chick) Price, 72, a West Los Angeles resident 
visiting for the first time with his wife, Dorothy, and a Thai neighbor, Nilla 
Kronprasert. "I've read about this in the paper. It's just beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Outside, a group of art students from Mt. San Antonio College in Walnut milled 
around the central courtyard of the 15-acre complex, admiring the glistening 
ocher tile roofs, gilded sculpture and intricate stone carvings. Nuns scurried 
from one building to another, offering hot tea to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
A solemn-faced Asian woman entered the Hall of Buddha, knelt on the tile floor 
and prostrated herself before three seven-foot-high fiberglass statues of the 
smiling deity, enveloped in a cloud of jasmine incense. 
</P>
<P>
As Hsi Lai Temple prepares to mark its second anniversary next month, spiritual 
leaders there are more than just religious mouthpieces and strict adherents of 
the eight precepts, or Buddhist commandments. Over the last two years, they 
also have served as ministers of culture to residents in the ethnically diverse 
community. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish classes are conducted in Chinese for the benefit of immigrants from 
Taiwan, China and Hong Kong who work side by side with newcomers from Mexico 
and Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the temple helped establish a sister school relationship 
between Nogales High School in La Puente and P'u Men High School at the Fo 
Kuang Shan Temple in Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of each month, the temple holds an "Eight Precepts Retreat" to teach 
lay people the basics of Buddhism. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 100 participants file into the Hall of Buddha and learn how to 
chant, prostrate before the deity and repent their bad deeds. They are served 
two vegetarian meals and, at the end of the day, sleep on floors in the 
monastery's living quarters, in accordance with a Buddhist teaching that 
followers of the religion forgo luxury. (Nuns and monks at Hsi Lai sleep on 
simple cots, Man Tao said.) 
</P>
<P>
Such is the rhythm of life at Hsi Lai -- not a rhythm that came easily to the 
Hacienda Heights temple. When the Buddhists first proposed the project 10 years 
ago, Hacienda Heights residents opposed it, showing up en masse before the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors to object to the temple's large size and 
the number of people and cars it would attract. Some feared the nuns and monks 
would startle neighbors with pre-dawn gongs and loud chanting. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, after 2,000 visitors descended on the temple during Chinese New 
Year, residents complained about illegally parked cars and traffic pouring onto 
Hacienda Boulevard. Supervisor Pete Schabarum warned temple officials that the 
large crowd violated a conditional-use permit. The county erected no parking 
signs on the street. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, fire officials said lighted niches with tiny statues of Buddha 
lining the walls of the main temple did not meet safety codes and would either 
have to be removed or protected with a sprinkler system. The temple opted for 
the latter. 
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, there are fewer complaints, mostly concentrated in the residential 
area surrounding the temple complex on Glenmark Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's in the wrong location," said Sharon Pluth, who lives on Thaxton Avenue a 
few blocks north of the monastery. "They made it into a tourist attraction. I 
would have fought just the same if they wanted to put Disneyland in my 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Besides being a religious and cultural center, Hsi Lai Temple has become a 
stopping-off point for Chinese students and scholars who have defected to the 
United States. Since the June 4 military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters 
in Beijing's Tian An Men Square, participants in the movement, including 
student leader Wuer Kaixi, have sought temporary refuge at the temple. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, Xu Jiatun, China's former top representative to Hong Kong whose 
departure from the British colony was the subject of widespread media 
speculation that he was planning to seek asylum in the United States, turned up 
in Southern California under the care of Hsi Lai's founder, Master Hsing Yun. 
</P>
<P>
Xu reportedly had fallen out of favor with Chinese Premier Li Peng for being 
sympathetic to the democracy movement. Last month, Hsing held a press 
conference at the temple to dispel rumors of Xu's defection. Hsing said the 
74-year-old Xu was merely vacationing and intended to return home. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Hsing said his willingness to house Xu, Wuer and others 
was merely a humanitarian gesture, which he would extend to people of all 
faiths and cultures. He added that he shied away from mixing religion and 
politics when he refused a request by Chinese community leaders to hold a 
ceremony at Hsi Lai Temple in commemoration of those killed in Tian An Men 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
"They have their political ideals, we have our own ideals of compassion and 
loving kindness," Hsing said through an interpreter. "For example, if a mother 
is beating her child, and the child is taken in by a third person, the mother 
would not have misunderstandings and blame the person for taking care of her 
child."

NEGOTIATIONS TO AGREE ON BUDGET FALTER 
</P>

Republican and Democratic negotiators retreated from earlier positions on 
spending reductions and tax increases Friday, slowing down work on an 
already-overdue state budget. 
</P>
<P>
Legislative leaders said the Assembly and Senate would work today and Sunday, 
but they held out little hope that agreement could be reached before the end of 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be here a few days," said Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco) after a meeting with Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti 
(D-Los Angeles) on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers had been scheduled to adjourn Friday for a monthlong recess. "I don't 
think we can -- or should -- leave town without a budget," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers are working to produce a combination of spending reductions or 
tax increases that will total $3.6 billion, which is said to be the size of the 
gap that exists between available tax revenues and service requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian has issued a budget that would increase spending by 7.4% 
and he is holding firm against tax increases. Democrats are pressing for a 
budget hike of more than 13%, arguing that soaring school enrollments, prison 
inmate populations and fast-growing welfare rolls are producing more demands 
for spending than the tax structure can support. 
</P>
<P>
Although negotiations are still wide open, sources said a $729-million tax 
proposal by Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno is under intense fire. 
With Republicans expressing little support for Maddy's proposal or other 
tax-increase measures, Democrats were pulling back from their agreements on 
spending reductions. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said lawmakers were "peeling off" various tax proposals because of 
lobbying pressure put on them by various interests whose businesses or 
industries would be hit by tax hikes. 
</P>
<P>
In the face of opposition to tax increases, Roberti, the Senate leader, began 
backing away from a $1.5-billion package of spending reductions he supported as 
recently as Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Roberti said that in order to back the kind of budget reductions sought by 
Deukmejian and GOP legislators, Democrats would have "to see $1 billion in 
revenues (tax increases)." 
</P>
<P>
Maddy said: "We don't think there are enough cuts, they don't think there are 
enough revenues, so we are trying to work it out."

PACIFIC LUMBER'S OLD-GROWTH REDWOOD LOGGING BID REJECTED

Pacific Lumber Co.'s plan to log 453 acres of old-growth timber in the north 
coast Headwaters Forest was rejected Friday by the California Department of 
Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
CDF officials cited concerns for the rare marbled murrelet, a robin-sized bird 
that nests in the tops of ancient redwood trees near the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
The decision was the latest obstacle to Pacific Lumber's plans to log the 3,000 
acres of virgin timber east of Eureka known as the Headwaters Forest. 
</P>
<P>
A lawsuit by environmental groups has blocked the company from carrying out 
state-approved plans to cut 319 acres in the forest, the largest remaining 
privately owned grove of ancient redwoods. 
</P>
<P>
The decision also highlighted growing public concern over the environmental 
impact of logging old-growth forests, where giant trees up to 1,500 years old 
shelter unique species of wildlife, including the controversial northern 
spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
The owl's listing as an endangered species by the federal government last month 
angered the timber industry, which said it could cost thousands of jobs. Unlike 
the spotted owl, the marbled murrelet is not listed as an endangered species by 
either the federal government or the state of California, although conservation 
groups have filed petitions to have it listed. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Lumber President John Campbell said the CDF decision was "based on 
political rather than scientific reasons." Pacific Lumber already has agreed to 
study the murrelet population and take steps to protect the birds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Lumber has 10 days to appeal the CDF decision to the state Board of 
Forestry.

CHAPMAN SHAW ROOT; FORMER COCA-COLA BOTTLING FIRM CHAIRMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chapman Shaw Root, 65, former chairman of the country's largest Coca-Cola 
bottling company and the grandson of the industrialist who designed the 
Coca-Cola bottle in the early 1900s. Root headed Associated Coca-Cola Bottlers 
from 1951 until 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The company had plants in Pennsylvania, Florida, New York and New Jersey. In 
1982, he sold his majority interest in the bottling company to the parent 
company of Coca-Cola for $417.5 million. Last October, Forbes magazine listed 
Root as the 389th wealthiest man in America with a net worth of $290 million. 
In 1966, he formed the Root Co. as parent company of his expanding financial 
holdings. At the time of his death, Root also owned such businesses as the 
Daytona Hilton and radio stations in Florida. Root was the grandson of Chapman 
J. Root, founder and owner of Root Glass Co., the firm that designed and 
patented the distinctive Coke bottle. That design led Chapman J. Root to 
acquire several Coca-Cola bottling franchises which later became the Terre 
Haute-based Associated Coca-Cola Bottlers. In Ormond Beach, Fla., on Monday of

HOMELESS ROUSTED FROM S.F. CIVIC CENTER

<TEXT>
<P>
Under a deadline imposed by Mayor Art Agnos, more than two dozen officers 
raided Civic Center Plaza before dawn Friday and gently rousted about 100 
transients from their illegal encampment across from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few hours after the police action, during which five people were 
arrested, the plaza was "reclaimed" by ordinary citizens. Mothers wheeled their 
babies on the paths; old men sat on the benches, reading newspapers and 
chatting; children fed the pigeons. Some folks inspected the pretty flower 
beds. 
</P>
<P>
It seemed that the homeless occupation of the plaza for more than two years had 
never taken place. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is very nice," said a broadly smiling Jack Richards, who moved to 
San Francisco from Ohio 20 years ago. "This is the way it used to be -- without 
the conflict, the yelling, the screaming." 
</P>
<P>
It was hard to believe that a few hours earlier police were ready to use force 
to remove the remnants of the occupiers of one of San Francisco's showplace 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the homeless had lived under the trees in the plaza for years. Agnos, 
who had been under heavy pressure to restore the plaza to general public use, 
vowed months ago to find housing for the homeless whether they liked it or not. 
</P>
<P>
One man was carried away in his sleeping bag. Homeless advocate Keith McHenry 
of the Food Not Bombs group was arrested and booked on suspicion of interfering 
with police. Other charges included misdemeanor counts of illegal lodging and 
illegal distribution of food, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the hard-core homeless who refused to leave the plaza and ignored the 
Friday deadline called their home under the trees "Camp Agnos." 
</P>
<P>
The plaza is bounded on the west by City Hall, the north by the 
earthquake-ruined State Office Building, the south by Civic Auditorium, and the 
east by the Main Public Library. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't fair," grumbled one man to the police officer who was ousting him. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't live here anymore," the policeman replied. "I'm not going to debate 
it with you." 
</P>
<P>
"Officers are using a low-key, friendly approach," Police Capt. Frank Jordan 
told reporters recording the scene. The chief said city officials were directed 
to try for a "humane solution" to the homeless situation. 
</P>
<P>
So far as 25-year-old Dale Forbis was concerned, life in the middle of San 
Francisco's seat of government was good enough for him and his wife, Patricia. 
They moved to San Francisco from Chicago four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness," Forbis said. "That's what this 
country was all about. So why can't I pursue my happiness the way I choose, as 
long as I'm not bothering anyone?" 
</P>
<P>
He said he has refused to take advantage of city multi-service centers opened 
this week, and hinted that the couple plan to move to a neighborhood south of 
the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Police provided a shuttle service with vans to move the homeless people and 
their belongings a few blocks to a big shelter at Polk and Geary streets. 
</P>
<P>
A garbage bin was pulled up on the sidewalk for trash. Some of the transients 
took advantage of it, while others eyed the junk for what they could use. 
</P>
<P>
Living a hard life often on the edge of violence, many of the homeless said 
they had formed strong friendships. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a small town here," said Oscar Amezquita, 33, who said he fled 
Guatemala two years ago for political reasons. He said he can't find work. 
</P>
<P>
"We trust each other, feed one another, take care of each other. We don't want 
to live in a shelter with people we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
One of the "graduates" of plaza living is 28-year-old Willie Lewis, who showed 
up on Thursday to lend support to his old buddies. For two years, Willie lived 
out of a sleeping bag in the plaza, his life, he said, a haze of drugs and 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
Willie said he took a look at his bleak life, cleaned himself up, got himself a 
job and moved into an apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"These folks took care of me when I was sick," he said. "I never went a day 
without eating, and I was never cold. . . . Sleeping out here is a hundred 
times better that those rat- and lice-infested hotels they want to send people 
to."

A nationwide strike by Sandinista workers grew louder and more physical as 
pipe-wielding peasants and chanting students joined workers demanding a voice 
in the country's economic policies. 
</P>
<P>
Union leaders estimated more than 85,000 people stayed away from work on the 
strike's fifth day, but the government insisted the figure was much lower. The 
strike, called to protest President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro's 
market-oriented economic polices, has spread to state-run banks and most of the 
government bureaucracy. Students, bus drivers and farm workers are also taking 
part in the walkout.

Rocky Flats, which produces plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons, has had its 
manufacturing operations suspended since December because of safety and 
environmental problems. The latest order applies to all handling and movement 
of nuclear materials, the department said. The announcement, reported by the

NASA officials, awaiting results of an investigation into the mirror flaws 
plaguing the Hubble Space Telescope, refused to comment on a report the space 
agency passed up chances to test the mirrors on the ground. Sources quoted in 
Aviation Week and Space Technology's July 9 issue said the Air Force offered 
NASA use of its spy satellite test facilities to check the $1.5-billion space 
telescope's two main mirrors 10 years ago. But NASA turned down the offer 
because the Air Force wanted all NASA and private industry personnel associated 
with the tests to obtain top secret military clearance, the sources said.

A National Endowment for the Arts advisory panel has denounced the agency's 
rejection of grant recommendations for performing artists Karen Finley, Holly 
Hughes, John Fleck and Tom Miller, and it is urging reconsideration of the 
decision, the panel chairman said. The artists all deal with political and 
sexual issues in provocative ways. "I think it is really an issue of 
censorship," said Phillip Arnoult, founder and artistic director of the Theatre 
Project, a performing arts center in Baltimore, where the artists had appeared.

An Oakland woman died after her car was struck by a police car that was 
traveling at an estimated 55 m.p.h. through an intersection during a high-speed 
chase, authorities said. 
</P>

Police said Patricia Welsh, 41, failed to yield for the patrol car, which was 
using its siren and flashing lights while chasing a van whose passengers were 
suspected in an East Oakland shooting. Sgt. Earl Sargent said the officers 
"were in pursuit of people suspected of attempted murder. They were well within 
policy." Welsh's passenger, Joe Fernandez of Oakland, was hospitalized in 
serious condition. Two officers in the car received minor injuries. The van got

<P>
The state Public Utilities Commission ordered the Santa Fe Railway to resume 
hauling truck trailers on flatcars on a rail line through the southeastern 
California desert. The PUC said the railway closed its loading ramps at Blythe 
in Riverside County in August with only four days' notice to local governments 
and shippers. 
</P>
<P>
The spur line, which runs from Ripley, south of Blythe, about 80 miles north to 
the Santa Fe main line at Cadiz in San Bernardino County, has served the Palo 
Verde, Coachella and Imperial valleys for many years, the commission said. The 
discounted service allowed truckers to load more than 6,000 trailers a year 
onto flatcars at Blythe for shipment. Santa Fe said the service was no longer 
profitable and also argued that the state had no legal authority over service 
on a spur line that is linked to a federally regulated interstate rail line. 
The PUC concluded, however, that it had jurisdiction over a spur line within 
the state and said Santa Fe had failed to document its claim that the service 
was unprofitable for the railway.

The Pacific Lumber Co.'s plan to log 453 acres of old-growth timber in the 
Headwaters Forest near Eureka was rejected by the California Department of 
Forestry and Fire Protection. 
</P>
<P>
Department officials cited concerns for the rare marbled murrelet, a small 
robin-sized bird that nests in the tops of ancient redwood trees near the 
Pacific Ocean. The decision was the latest obstacle to Pacific Lumber's plans 
to log the 3,000 acres of virgin timber east of Eureka, known as the Headwaters 
Forest. A lawsuit by environmental groups has blocked the company from carrying 
out state-approved plans to cut 319 acres in the forest, the largest privately 
owned grove of ancient redwoods in the world.

Under a deadline imposed by San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos, more than two dozen 
police officers rousted 100 transients out of their illegal encampment across 
from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the homeless had lived under the trees in the plaza for years. Agnos, 
who was under heavy pressure to restore the plaza to general public use, vowed 
months ago to find housing for the homeless whether they liked it or not. One 
man was carried away in his sleeping bag. Homeless advocate Keith McHenry of 
the Food Not Bombs group was arrested and booked on a charge of interfering 
with police. Other charges included misdemeanor counts of illegal lodging and 
illegal distribution of food, police said.

<P>
A psychiatric unit at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Long Beach -- shut 
down in May after five patient suicides -- is scheduled to reopen Monday as a 
federal investigation into the deaths continues. 
</P>
<P>
The number of beds has been cut from 28 to 10, the nursing staff has been newly 
trained and new supervisors have been assigned to the locked ward, where the 
most unstable psychiatric patients are held. 
</P>
<P>
The ward was shut down in May after a 27-year-old Marine hanged himself in a 
bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth patient suicide in 13 months; two others hanged themselves, 
one jumped from a hospital roof and a fifth shot himself shortly after he was 
allegedly granted an early release, according to records and staff members.

Lenain has been charged with receiving stolen property, a felony that carries a 
penalty of up to a year in state prison or county jail, Solis said. The 
tortoises were healthy and munching grass back at the center Friday afternoon,

The Gem Cafe, a decades-old Hermosa Beach diner that was to have been shut down

of community support and a last-minute compromise.

The restaurant's owners, Henry and Grace Poirier, had been facing the demise of 
the diner they bought 28 years ago from two sisters who had founded it in 1949.

Now they have a six-month lease that will give them until Dec. 31 to find a new 
location.

So you're 11 years old and your dog ate your homework, your bike had a flat and 
you're having a crummy day in the classroom. It isn't easy being a child in the 
stressful '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Relax. 
</P>

That's the advice of teacher Betty Mehling at Lupin Hill Elementary School in 
the Las Virgenes School District. More than advice, it's part of the lesson 
plan. For Mehling, relaxin' is the fourth R. 
</P>
<P>
"Teaching children to relax is giving them the answer of how to deal with 
stress and tension," says Mehling. "Today's young are bombarded with the 
negative -- say no to drugs, drinking, smoking and sex." 
</P>
<P>
Mehling, who has instructed children in the art of relaxation for 10 years,

LAST-MINUTE AMNESTY BIDS MUST BE MADE IN HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to cut down on long lines at legalization offices throughout the 
region, officials of the Immigration and Naturalization Service said Friday 
that they will require last-minute amnesty candidates from a seven-county area 
to make their applications at the INS' Hollywood office. 
</P>
<P>
Staff shortages at 10 legalization offices serving the INS' Los Angeles 
District meant that undocumented aliens hoping for a last chance to qualify for 
amnesty under the 1986 Immigration and Reform Act were being turned away at 
many sites. 
</P>
<P>
Aliens were camping out overnight at some offices, and violence broke out at 
the Santa Ana office. 
</P>
<P>
Problems had been reported at other INS offices throughout the Southwest, but 
lines were longest in the Los Angeles District, officials said. By dedicating 
the Hollywood office entirely to the late applications, officials said, they 
hope to relieve the other offices. 
</P>
<P>
"People are not going to be sleeping in parking lots in this region or anywhere 
else in the country," said Ben Davidian, INS Western regional commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Davidian said that when INS Commissioner Gene McNary in Washington was told 
about the long lines at some offices, he ordered local officials to come up 
with an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Immigrant rights advocates criticized the solution. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Alva, an attorney with the Los Angeles Legal Aid Foundation, said: "We 
understand there has to be some sort of system. But the idea they came up with 
totally misses the boat. It appears totally intended to alleviate their 
black-eye image, to take the lines off the street. To have that one office deal 
with a seven-county district is ludicrous. It's going to require people to 
travel from Riverside, San Bernardino and Orange County to this one office. 
It's insane."

Los Angeles city officials are seeking to shut down a privately run U.S. 
Immigration and Naturalization Service detention center in the Pico-Union 
District that has been the focus of repeated demonstrations in recent months by 
radical groups. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, two officials from a firm that runs the detention center were 
arraigned in Los Angeles Municipal Court on charges that their company, 
Transitional Housing Inc., has violated building and zoning ordinances by 
operating the facility without a permit in a commercial zone. 
</P>
<P>
Claiming that the building is approved to operate only as a hotel for the aged, 
the city attorney's office filed a misdemeanor criminal complaint last May to 
close the green, two-story "Alvarado Processing and Residential Center," used 
by the INS to detain applicants for political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
Transitional Housing Inc. owner Karl Harz and company president Richard Edwards 
deny the charges, claiming that they are operating a legally permitted 
board-and-care facility. They said they have made hundreds of thousands of 
dollars worth of improvements, transforming a crime-ridden building into a safe 
and useful public facility. 
</P>
<P>
"I should be getting a plaque from Mayor Bradley rather than getting hassled," 
said Harz, a Redondo Beach businessman. 
</P>
<P>
Harz and other company officials claim that their prosecution by the city is 
politically motivated by Councilwoman Gloria Molina, who asked building 
officials to investigate the facility after it opened. 
</P>
<P>
But officials with the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety point to 
the facility's barred windows, motion detectors, security guards and wire mesh 
-- which encloses inside balconies and keeps second-floor residents from 
climbing onto the roof -- as evidence that the owners are violating their 
certificate of occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
"That's certainly out of the ordinary for a hotel for the aged," said Timothy 
O'Conner, a city building inspector. "They're using the structure in an 
unapproved manner." 
</P>
<P>
Alma Martinez, a spokeswoman for Molina, said the INS and Transitional Housing 
should have gone through public hearings to obtain a conditional-use permit or 
variance before opening the facility. 
</P>
<P>
"There would have been plenty of normal proceedings in which to discuss this," 
Martinez said. "What we're trying to do is clean up the area and bring in 
productive, viable industry, not another incarceration facility." 
</P>
<P>
A similar battle was fought in 1986, when a converted Hollywood motel being 
used as an INS detention center came under fire from the community and was 
cited by the city for building and zoning violations. The center's operator 
shut down the facility later that year. 
</P>
<P>
INS officials declined to enter the fray. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position is we have a contractual agreement with this firm," said INS 
spokeswoman Virginia Kice. "As long as they're providing services, we won't get 
involved. If the city takes some action that prevents them from providing 
services, then we'll have to take action." 
</P>
<P>
The Alvarado Street center has been the scene of violent clashes in recent 
months between police and leftist immigrant-rights advocates who claim that the 
facility is a "concentration camp." Dozens of protesters have been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Pico-Union residents say that while they are tired of the repeated protests at 
the detention center, they reject arguments by Transitional Housing officials 
that the facility improves conditions in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a scandal," said Raul Diaz, leader of a local homeowners group. 
"People cannot live like this." 
</P>
<P>
Transitional Housing won the $2-million detention facility contract last fall 
after the INS stopped using another privately run center in Inglewood. 
Transitional Housing's contract expires in September, by which time the INS 
hopes to have completed construction of its own detention center at the 
agency's former regional headquarters in San Pedro. The agency's only other 
detention facilities in Southern California are in El Centro and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Alvarado Street detention center was troubled from the start. The facility 
went without a director experienced in detention facilities until this week, 
when Transitional Housing hired retired INS employee George Rayner to fill that 
job. And another firm run by Harz -- which owned the building being used for 
the center -- recently filed for bankruptcy. That firm, Alternative Funding 
Sources Ltd., could no longer meet $30,000 monthly interest payments on the 
property, Harz said. 
</P>
<P>
Harz said the current legal owner of the building is one of his creditors. 
</P>
<P>
The facility holds about 220 immigrant men, women and children at a time, some 
of them for several weeks or months. Most of those detained are applicants for 
political asylum, who must stay in the center until their cases are adjudicated 
or until they can raise the $500 to $2,000 needed to meet bond. 
</P>
<P>
Refugees from Afghanistan constitute the largest nationality group at the 
center. There are several Pakistanis, Salvadorans, Sri Lankans and Mexicans 
there as well. The refugees sleep in bunk beds, four to six per room. Each room 
is equipped with a small television and bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
The detainees are free to roam the center and use its Ping-Pong tables or a 
small recreation area, but unarmed Pinkerton security guards watch the 
building's exits. Although INS rules forbid them from leaving the center, a few 
have left anyway, Edwards said. In those cases, the guards, who are not armed 
and are instructed to avoid using force, notify the INS of the escapes.

STATE REQUIRES SCHOOLS TO REPORT CHILD ABUSE; 
</P>
<P>
LAW: EMPLOYEES MUST CALL IN EVIDENCE OR RELIABLE REPORTS OF NEGLECT OR ABUSE 
IMMEDIATELY. L.A. DISTRICT ALSO HAS ITS OWN SYSTEM FOR CONFORMING TO LAW.

<P>
Procedures for school officials to report cases of suspected child abuse by 
anyone are spelled out in state law. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Los Angeles Unified School District has its own system for 
ensuring that all its employees are familiar with the law and know what their 
responsibilities are. 
</P>
<P>
School employees must report evidence or reliable reports of neglect or of 
physical, sexual or emotional abuse immediately by telephone to a child 
protective agency. In Los Angeles, that is local police, the Sheriff's 
Department or the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services. The 
telephoned information must be followed up within 36 hours by a written report 
on a state-supplied form. 
</P>
<P>
Once a case is reported, district officials said, they generally take their cue 
from the investigating agency on how to proceed or what the school's further 
role should be. 
</P>
<P>
Those who fail to follow the proper procedures are subject to criminal 
prosecution. All new district employees are required to sign a statement that 
they are familiar with the reporting law and that they will report suspected 
cases as required. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, the Los Angeles district developed its reporting policy 
with the assistance of a project known as CARE -- Child Abuse: Recognize and 
Eliminate. 
</P>
<P>
The CARE program, headed by former teacher Shayla Lever, provides intensive 
training for teachers, other staff members and parents in 152 of the district's 
elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
Lever said one of the most difficult aspects of child abuse is getting people 
to recognize what is and is not abuse, along with the need to be specific. 
</P>
<P>
For example, it is not against the law for a parent to spank a child; however, 
any injury that resulted from the spanking would be considered child abuse and 
must be reported. Vague statements cannot be reported, she said. If someone 
accused a teacher of touching a student in a way that was "inappropriate," it 
would be up to the principal, for instance, to determine just what was touched 
and how before deciding whether the incident should be reported. 
</P>
<P>
Lever said the district's policy was already in place when teacher Terry 
Bartholome was accused in 1984 of molesting several of his third-grade students 
at 68th Street Elementary School in South-Central Los Angeles. Bartholome was 
later convicted and sentenced to 44 years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
She noted that a district administrator was convicted of a misdemeanor for not 
properly reporting the students' allegations against Bartholome. The 
administrator's conviction was overturned on appeal.

GETTY PULLS STATUE FROM DISPLAY; 
</P>
<P>
ART: NEW DOUBTS SURFACE OVER AUTHENTICITY OF THE MALIBU MUSEUM'S PRIZED GREEK 
WORK, "KOUROS." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu has removed its prized Greek "Kouros" for 
study because of new doubts about the authenticity of the statue. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot, 8-inch-tall marble sculpture of a young man, thought to date from 
the 6th Century B.C., is one of the museum's three most celebrated Greek 
antiquities, along with a monumental marble "Aphrodite" and a bronze 
"Victorious Athlete." 
</P>
<P>
The museum in Malibu purchased the "Kouros" -- reportedly for more than $6 
million -- in 1985 after 14 months of study and put it on view in 1986 after 
additional study and conservation at the Getty. But a recent discovery of a 
marble torso that is generally regarded as a forgery or a modern copy has 
raised new questions about the Getty statue. 
</P>
<P>
The torso, which came to the museum's attention in April, depicts only part of 
a male nude figure and it differs in surface and general appearance, but it is 
made of similar marble, "possibly from the same quarry" and it contains "subtle 
similarities of style and detail," Getty curator Marion True said in a prepared 
statement Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The museum has purchased the torso from an unidentified private collector who 
brought it to True's attention. The "Kouros" was removed from the antiquities 
gallery on Friday, and the two pieces will be studied during the next several 
months in the museum's conservation laboratory, museum director John Walsh said 
in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, we will be very disappointed if our new studies lead to the 
conclusion that the museum's 'Kouros' is not an authentic work," Walsh said, 
"but it's most important that we try to discover the truth about the two 
statues. 
</P>
<P>
"These cases arise in the field, and they occur at this museum as they do in 
other museums that collect antiquities. The main thing is to determine the 
truth and make it known," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The situation would seem to be an embarrassment to the wealthy museum, which is 
often in the news, but Walsh said the "Kouros" affair is more of "a puzzle, 
though a very prominent puzzle." 
</P>
<P>
Another, less-prominent sculpture in the Getty's collection -- a marble "Head 
of Achilles," once thought to be the work of 4th-Century B.C. Greek master 
Skopus -- was discovered to be a modern copy two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said the "Kouros" always has presented puzzling questions for the museum. 
Critics have commented on the statue's archaic-style smile and the fact that 
its stylized hair, eyes and hands contrast with more realistic feet and flesh 
around the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
In a study published by the museum, True acknowledged that the "Kouros" had 
"unusual stylistic features," Walsh said. Some anatomical forms on the marble 
appear old-fashioned while others are more up-to-date, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's something that has to be explained. Marion weighed the possibility that 
it might be a forgery on the one hand or that it was done in a slightly 
provincial style on the other" and decided in favor of the latter 
interpretation, Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
Her conclusion was supported by scientific findings that the crust on the 
surface of the stone had occurred naturally over time and had not been induced 
by a forger. Before the sculpture was installed in the museum's gallery, 
Stanley Margolis, a geochemist from UC Davis, studied the surface of the marble 
and Jerry Podany, head of the Getty's antiquities conservation laboratory, ran 
tests determining that the marble had come from a quarry on the Island of 
Thasos. 
</P>
<P>
But the torso has sufficient similarities in the execution of the anatomy to 
cause the museum to rethink its earlier conclusions, Walsh said. He declined to 
comment on the museum's recourse if the "Kouros" is proven to be a fake. "That 
would be between us and the seller," he said. The museum bought the statue at 
an undisclosed price from a private collector through an unidentified Swiss 
dealer. 
</P>
<P>
When the "Kouros" was acquired by the museum, it was lauded as an extremely 
rare acquisition. A person with close ties to the museum was quoted in 1987 as 
saying that the Getty paid more than $6 million for the statue. Only about a 
dozen complete examples of "Kouros" figures are known to exist among about 250 
fragmentary works around the world. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York 
is the only other American museum that has a complete "Kouros" in its 
collection. The Met bought its statue in 1932, the last time a "Kouros" had 
come on the market before the Getty made its 1985 purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Hoving, former director of the Met, editor of Connoisseur magazine and a 
frequent critic of the Getty, charged that the statue was a fake at the time of 
the Getty's purchase. He based his argument on the opinion of Giuseppe Cellini, 
a Roman conservator, who thought the "Kouros" was an entirely different statue 
from the one the Getty actually bought. Subsequently, other scholars have 
expressed doubts about the piece, but "the weight of opinion was in favor of 
authenticity," Walsh said.

ANGELS SEND WHITE BACK TO MINORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
If he truly has the boundless potential the Angels believe and not merely the 
dashes of brilliance he has shown, Devon White will have to prove it in the 
minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
White, a two-time Gold Glove winner and 1989 All-Star who was hitting .213 and 
leading the Angels with 71 strikeouts, was optioned to triple-A Edmonton Friday 
in a move that neither he nor his teammates expected. White left Milwaukee 
without talking with reporters, but an associate of his agent, Ed Keating, said 
the 27-year-old outfielder was "more surprised than anything else" by the move. 
</P>
<P>
Even Greg Minton, who was activated off the 60-day emergency disabled list and 
took White's roster spot, was surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking about the ways they might get me back on this team, and this 
wasn't one of them," said Minton, who underwent elbow surgery April 27. 
</P>
<P>
The move reduces the glut in the Angel outfield, which had produced grumbling, 
and apparently leaves center field to Dante Bichette and Max Venable. Luis 
Polonia, who on Thursday advocated making a move to cut the number of idle 
outfielders and establish a set lineup, said he felt badly for White but 
thought a change could be beneficial. "We were struggling. Something had to be 
done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Manager Doug Rader said the move "should be looked at as an opportunity and not 
a demotion," and that although White had made strides in improving his 
offensive efforts, his production was insufficient. White, who in 1987 -- his 
first full season -- hit .263 with 24 home runs and 87 runs batted in, peaked 
this season at .227 on June 2. He had seven home runs and 22 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, this will get him over the hump," Rader said. "Hopefully, by 
removing the pressure of major league life and competition, he might be able to 
do that. We understand we're going to lose (the defensive) aspect. It's 
something you don't relish, but we're trying to develop a player to the 
greatest degree of his ability, and that includes offense as well." 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Mike Port said he remains convinced that White's potential is 
genuine and said the time in Edmonton could allow the Angels "to find the key 
for him to play to the best of those abilities." 
</P>
<P>
"The adjustment we made today is purely constructive in nature," Port said by 
phone from California. "It's not in any way detrimental to Devon. The potential 
is absolutely there and, aside from that, we've all seen the abilities he has 
on the basepaths and how he can drive the ball. There was too terribly much 
ability there for us to go on with the status quo. We hope this constitutes 
taking a step back to take two steps forward." 
</P>
<P>
Port also said that reducing the number of outfielders to five, plus designated 
hitter Brian Downing, was not the sole intent. "This gives us the 11th pitcher, 
and we had pretty good stretches last season when we had 11 pitchers," Port 
said.

A DISMAYED HERZOG QUITS AS MANAGER OF CARDINALS 
</P>

Whitey Herzog, whose brand of running baseball brought the St. Louis Cardinals 
three National League pennants and one World Series championship in 11 seasons, 
resigned as manager Friday, saying he could no longer motivate his last-place 
team. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've done a good job as a manager this year," Herzog said. "I 
just can't get the guys to play. I think anybody could do a better job. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not happy the way the ballclub has played. I'm the manager and I take full 
responsibility for it." 
</P>
<P>
Herzog will be replaced as manager on an interim basis by Red Schoendienst, 
General Manager Dal Maxvill said. 
</P>
<P>
Herzog, 58, said he would remain with the Cardinals as a vice president, 
primarily advising on player personnel matters. But he said he is not 
necessarily ending his career as a manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to sit here and tell anyone that I wouldn't want to manage 
again," Herzog said. "I don't know how I am going to feel two years from now. I 
don't want to manage this year. I really don't think I want to manage next 
year. But I don't want that etched in stone, because I might get the itch to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Herzog said the Cardinals have agreed to honor his contract, which runs through 
1992, but have told him they would let him out of the deal for a job with 
another team. 
</P>
<P>
Herzog showed no emotion during the 25-minute news conference at the team's 
hotel in downtown San Diego. But after leaving the podium, he became teary when 
he was hugged by first baseman Pedro Guerrero, the former Dodger. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel bad because a lot of things that Whitey said are right," Guerrero said. 
"We should be in a better situation with the ballclub that we have, but we just 
haven't been getting the job done." 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals entered Friday night's game against the San Diego Padres in last 
place in the National League East with a 33-47 record, 14 1/2 games behind 
first-place Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the poor start, Herzog's announcement apparently came as a surprise to 
all but a few club executives who knew of his misgivings. Herzog said he tried 
to resign about three weeks ago but was talked out of it by Maxvill and Fred 
Kuhlmann, the Cardinals' president. 
</P>
<P>
"He told us then it could get a lot uglier," Maxvill said. 
</P>
<P>
The low point, Herzog said, came earlier in the week when the Cardinals were 
swept in a three-game series in San Francisco by a combined score of 16-4. The 
last loss was by a 9-2 score in a game in which the Giants scored eight runs in 
the seventh and eighth innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I was totally embarrassed by the way my ballclub played up there," Herzog 
said. "I can stand losing, if the team is playing up to its capabilities. But I 
was bewildered a little bit. I just can't believe that we can have players that 
as a team are playing as bad as they have. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what it is. I've never been through a situation like this. The 
effort is there . . . but sometimes I don't know if their minds are there. We 
make so many bad plays fundamentally. I think that is a reflection on me." 
</P>
<P>
He said he told Kuhlmann of his decision Friday morning. This time, Kuhlmann 
said, he did not try to dissuade Herzog. 
</P>
<P>
"We were reluctant to accept his resignation," Kuhlmann said. "It's too bad we 
had to reach this point." Herzog said the decision was entirely his, and that 
he was under no pressure from management to step down. His resignation brought 
to an end one of the most successful eras in Cardinal history. 
</P>
<P>
Herzog came to the team in June of 1980 after five seasons in Kansas City that 
included three American League West titles. He managed the Cardinals until the 
last six weeks of the 1980 season, then became general manager. He served as 
both manager and general manager in 1981 and relinquished his front-office 
duties a year later. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to lead the Cardinals to the 1982 World Series title and NL pennants 
in 1985 and '87. His last game was a 4-1 victory over the Padres Thursday. His 
822 victories with the Cardinals are second only to Schoendienst's 1,028. 
</P>
<P>
This is the third time Schoendienst, 67, has managed the Cardinals. The first 
was for a club-record 12 seasons beginning in 1965, and the Cardinals won 
consecutive National League pennants in 1967-68 and the 1967 World Series. He 
also took over on an interim basis for Herzog in the final stages of the 1980 
season. He has been a coach with the team since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Herzog is the fourth major league manager to leave his job this season. Bucky 
Dent was fired by the New York Yankees and replaced by Stump Merrill; Russ 
Nixon was fired by the Atlanta Braves and replaced by General Manager Bobby 
Cox, and Davey Johnson was fired by the Mets and replaced by Bud Harrelson. 
</P>
<P>
Herzog was to leave San Diego Friday and said he plans to take some time off. 
</P>
<P>
Herzog has managed for at least a part of the past 18 seasons, compiling a 
record of 1,281-1,125 with the Texas Rangers, the Angels, Kansas City and St. 
Louis. Only Sparky Anderson of Detroit (1,797) has more victories among active 
managers.

A seven-car crash during practice for today's Pepsi 400 stock car race at

</P>
<P>
Terry Labonte and Dave Marcis were less seriously injured in the accident in 
which six cars, including three of the eight fastest qualifiers, were so badly 
damaged that their owners will have to use backup cars in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Waltrip, 43, who had qualified for his 500th start, instead will be sidelined 
for at least two months after being admitted to the intensive surgical care 
center at Halifax Medical Center in serious but stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
Waltrip was unconscious when rescue workers reached his Chevrolet, but he 
quickly regained consciousness. His car was hit on the driver's side door, and 
most of the front end was torn off. Workers cut away the roof, pulled Waltrip 
out and placed him on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
Labonte and Marcis were treated at the hospital and released, and each said 
they hoped to be well enough to start the race. Jimmy Horton, who has won four 
consecutive Automobile Racing Club of America races on superspeedways this 
year, will replace Waltrip. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Martin, Ernie Irvan and Phil Barkdoll also crumpled their cars but were 
not hurt. Bill Elliott cracked the front bumper on his Ford but was otherwise 
unscathed.

Jose Sulaiman, president of the World Boxing Council, testified in New York 
that promoter Don King never asked him to overturn the outcome of Buster 
Douglas' heavyweight title victory over Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by King's attorney, Alan Unger, if the promoter had asked for a rematch, 
Sulaiman said: "I think he did. 
</P>
<P>
I heard him during the time of the press conference. But I'm not sure." 
</P>
<P>
Sulaiman said he personally favored an immediate rematch, but the WBC Executive 
Council has ruled that Douglas should first make a mandatory defense against 
Evander Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
Sulaiman testified on the fourth day of King's breach-of-contract suit against 
Douglas and his manager, John Johnson. King also is suing the Mirage Hotel and 
Casino for allegedly inducing Johnson to sign a contract with the Mirage to 
fight Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, Johnson and the Mirage have sued King for breach of contract in 
federal court in Nevada, but that suit has been stayed pending the outcome of 
the New York trial.

Two 1988 U.S. Olympic heroes won events Friday in the opening day of the Santa 
Clara International Swim Meet, but their times were well off world and American 
records. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Biondi, of Castro Valley, Calif., who won seven medals in Seoul, held off 
Bart Pippenger of Kamiah, Idaho, who was competing for the Las Vegas Gold, to 
win the men's 100-meter butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
Biondi was clocked in 56.06 seconds, which didn't threaten Pablo Morales' world 
and American standard of 52.84 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Triple gold-medal winner Janet Evans of Placentia, who attends Stanford 
University, bested Michelle Von Notze of Australia in the women's 400-meter 
individual medley. She finished in 4:57.13, nearly 20 seconds slower than her 
American record of 4:37.76. 
</P>
<P>
None of the other six individual winners in the first day of the three-day meet 
came close to the record books either.

ODDS AGAINST GARRISON AGAIN AS SHE TRIES TO DENY NAVRATILOVA

<P>
So, Martina Navratilova, your path to the women's final and a record ninth 
Wimbledon title has been cleared of Steffi Graf, now how do you feel? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just trying not to hyperventilate," Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
All that separates the 33-year-old Navratilova from a ninth Wimbledon crown -- 
Helen Wills Moody had eight, the last in 1938 -- is Zina Garrison. 
</P>
<P>
The odds are against Garrison, who is 1-27 against Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
"I've beaten her once and I've played her close in a lot of situations," 
Garrison said. "And you get to a final, a final like this on grass, anything 
can happen." 
</P>
<P>
A 26-year-old Texan, Garrison is the second black woman to appear in a 
Wimbledon final. The first was Althea Gibson, who won consecutive titles in 
1957 and '58. 
</P>
<P>
Navratilova's 98 Wimbledon singles victories are a record. In six matches so 
far this year, Navratilova has lost only 24 games, without dropping a set, as 
she chases her dream of a record ninth title. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had a bit of an obsession, too," Garrison said. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked on a lot of sprints, a lot of running, weights -- I was running 
eight, nine miles a day almost -- and just trying to get into top shape and be 
ready, (so) if I have the opportunity to do it, I knew I could do my best." 
</P>
<P>
To get to the final, Garrison saved 28 of 38 break points, won 84% of her 
service games and beat No. 3-seeded Monica Seles and No. 1 Graf. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison has even served more aces than Navratilova, 13-11. 
</P>
<P>
"She has beaten Steffi, so she can certainly beat me," Navratilova said. "I'm 
confident, too, but I'm not certainly counting my chickens before they're 
hatched." THOMAS BONK

SPIEGEL GETS STAY AGAINST ORDER TO DEPOSIT ASSETS; 
</P>
<P>
THRIFTS: THE EX-COLUMBIA S&amp;L CHIEF IS GRANTED A TEMPORARY REPRIEVE FROM 
PUTTING $19 MILLION OF RESTITUTIONS AND PENALTIES INTO AN ESCROW ACCOUNT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas Spiegel, former Columbia Savings &amp; Loan chief executive, won a 
reprieve Friday from immediately depositing $19 million of restitutions and 
penalties into an escrow account. 
</P>
<P>
But in granting the reprieve, U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson in Los 
Angeles froze the assets of Spiegel and his wife, and required him to post a 
$1-million bond by next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In a two-hour hearing, Spiegel's attorneys successfully challenged an order 
issued Thursday by the Office of Thrift Supervision that would have required 
Spiegel to place the funds and his Columbia stock in an escrow account by noon 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The order was part of the largest civil complaint ever filed by S&amp;L 
regulators against an individual. In that administrative complaint, the OTS on 
Thursday charged Spiegel with improperly diverting $19 million of the thrift's 
funds to pay himself hefty bonuses, buy luxury planes, a gun collection and 
condominiums, among other allegations. The OTS also moved to levy a $5-million 
fine against Spiegel for burdening the Beverly Hills-based S&amp;L with losses. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel's attorneys challenged the applicability of the laws on which the OTS 
based its complaint. They argued that those laws apply only to current S&amp;L 
officers. Spiegel resigned as Columbia's chief in December and since then has 
severed all direct management ties to the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel's attorneys also argued that regulators failed to give the former 
executive a fair hearing. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been conducting an investigation for more than seven months and 
they've provided no explanation as to why it was necessary to act as 
precipitously as they did," Spiegel attorney Dennis Perluss said after the 
hearing. "They filed their charges without giving us any advance notice. They 
provided no justification for the cease-and-desist order." 
</P>
<P>
In granting Spiegel a temporary restraining order, Wilson said the balance of 
hardships in the case "tips strongly" in favor of the former Columbia chief. 
Wilson said Spiegel must notify the government 48 hours in advance of any 
expense he incurs of more than $5,000, excluding attorneys' fees or 
"reasonable" living expenses, and that such expenditures can be challenged in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
The judge said Spiegel and his wife could not "transfer, sell, encumber or 
otherwise dissipate" assets, including transferring them outside the country. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson scheduled a July 30 hearing to explore regulators' charges. Both sides 
are required to file court papers in the case no later than July 16, he ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Harris Weinstein, chief counsel for OTS, said after the hearing that "the OTS 
is pleased the judge has placed significant constraints on the ability of Mr. 
and Mrs. Spiegel to use and move their assets while the matter is under court 
consideration." 
</P>
<P>
However, the judge denied an OTS request that the Spiegels file with the court 
a statement disclosing their assets. Weinstein said that denial could hinder 
efforts to enforce the freeze. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always harder when you have to go back and reconstruct assets as of a 
certain date," Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel, in a written statement, called Wilson's order "fair and reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
Spiegel and his family control about two-thirds of Columbia stock. But those 
securities are virtually worthless, as the thrift has posted huge losses during 
the past year, in part because of the decline in value of its $3-billion 
portfolio of risky junk bonds.

ARCO TUNE-UP CENTERS SHIFT ATTENTION TO SMOG CHECKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Atlantic Richfield Co. plans to change the emphasis of its MP&amp;G Tune-Up 
centers to focus on the smog-check business as tougher state laws have forced 
many service stations and auto repair shops to limit or stop performing 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
MP&amp;G franchisees, which provide automotive repairs at about 100 Arco 
stations in Southern California, said the company will change the name of the 
operation later this summer as part a new marketing campaign that will put 
greater emphasis on the smog-check business. Officials at Arco, a Los 
Angeles-based energy company, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The move comes as many stations have abandoned or curtailed smog inspections, 
citing the high cost of new equipment and a tougher new state exam that has 
dramatically cut the number of technicians qualified to conduct inspections. 
</P>
<P>
"Arco is trying to cash in on this here," said Mostafa El Ali, a former 
MP&amp;G franchisee. "The only thing that has salvaged MP&amp;G is the 
smog-check business." 
</P>
<P>
At the end of June, 15,850 technicians -- about 10,000 fewer than last year -- 
were certified statewide to conduct smog inspections, according to the state 
Bureau of Automotive Repair, which oversees the smog inspection program. The 
number of smog inspection stations has also dropped to 7,900 from 8,200. 
</P>
<P>
"They made it so tough that mechanics who have been in the business 25 years 
could not pass the test," said Al Juntila, manager of A-1 Automotive in Los 
Angeles. "I took the test and failed myself." As a result, Juntila says the 
shop performs only five smog inspections a week, compared to 25 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
At Sedgeman Automotive Service in Los Angeles, owner Bob Sedgeman said he 
stopped performing smog inspections after balking at spending up to $20,000 for 
new testing equipment. "It ain't worthwhile to do the test," he said. 
</P>
<P>
State officials expect the situation to improve as technicians retake the exam. 
Government and industry officials note that the high failure rate highlights 
the shortage of mechanics qualified to repair the new breed of high-tech autos. 
</P>
<P>
A little more than 50% of those tested since last September have failed the 
portion of the exam that would permit them to perform smog checks on cars made 
after 1979, when the automotive industry began widely using high technology. In 
contrast, 72% of those tested have qualified to inspect less sophisticated cars 
made in 1979 or earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a lot of mechanics who were in the business a long time, and the 
technology got ahead of them," said bureau spokeswoman Kate McGuire. "They 
wanted to keep it simple. We just wanted to keep up with the technology of the 
auto industry." 
</P>
<P>
Many in the auto repair industry agree. 
</P>
<P>
"The handwriting has been on the wall for the past 10 years," said William 
Plummer, who owns two auto repair shops in Pasadena and Walnut and passed the 
state exam. "The automotive trade needs high-tech people and they are not 
getting them. It's hard to get people into the field." 
</P>
<P>
"It's expensive," Plummer said of the inspection equipment. "It may cost you 
some money, but I still think it's the right thing to do for the environment."

UNEMPLOYMENT DIPS 0.1% DESPITE SLOWER JOB GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a continuing slump in manufacturing and construction jobs, the nation's 
unemployment rate edged down 0.1% in June to 5.2% of the work force, the Labor 
Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Although the latest figures suggested that the economy has not emerged from its 
lengthy slowdown, analysts said the Federal Reserve is not expected to move 
quickly to nudge interest rates down to stimulate growth. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no real zip in this economy," said Elliott Platt of Donaldson, Lufkin 
&amp; Jenrette Securities in New York, "but you don't have the combination of 
recessionary forces to drag it into negative territory, either." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, a sharp upward revision in May's job figures -- showing that about 
155,000 jobs were added outside the government work force instead of the 
original estimate of 19,000 -- convinced some investors on Wall Street that the 
economy has been somewhat stronger than they thought. 
</P>
<P>
The result was a selloff in the bond market, where traders had been hoping that 
a weak employment report would persuade the Federal Reserve to cut short-term 
interest rates after six months of holding monetary policy steady. 
</P>
<P>
"This report will not force the Fed to ease," said Robert Dederick, chief 
economist at Northern Trust Co. of Chicago. "The month before was revised up, 
and unemployment was lower." 
</P>
<P>
The Fed is expected to wait for evidence later this month that should indicate 
whether consumers will boost spending enough to sustain a recent production 
upswing. Retail sales have slumped for three months in a row, an unprecedented 
downturn for a non-recessionary period. 
</P>
<P>
But some economists believe that the Commerce Department's estimates of a sharp 
spending falloff are mistaken. Government economic reports are frequently 
revised as experts gather more data, often providing a sharply different 
portrait of the economy than the first evidence suggests. 
</P>
<P>
A separate calculation of unemployment that includes military forces stationed 
in the United States fell to 5.1% in June from 5.3% in May. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses added a modest 97,000 payroll jobs last month, according to the 
Labor Department report. But overall non-farm employment rose by just 40,000, 
largely because the Census Bureau began layoffs of hundreds of thousands of 
extra workers it had hired for the once-a-decade population count. 
</P>
<P>
The 40,000 increase in jobs came on top of an explosive employment gain of 
356,000 in May, more than double the 164,000 first reported. Roughly 200,000 of 
the jobs added in May were attributable to the hiring of census workers. 
</P>
<P>
In California, the jobless rate fell to 4.9% from 5.4% for the previous two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Unemployment has remained remarkably steady for roughly two years, but job 
growth has slowed to just half the pace of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 290,000 Americans have entered the work force so far this year, said 
Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, compared to 1.5 
million who either found jobs or were actively looking during the same period 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the private sector job growth in recent months has occurred in service 
industries, while the nation's manufacturing sector has shed jobs for more than 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
Factory payrolls lost another 31,000 jobs in June. It was the 14th time in 15 
months that manufacturing employment has fallen, cutting roughly 335,000 jobs 
from the post-recession peak in March, 1989. Construction employment fell by 
14,000, the fourth monthly decline in a row, reflecting a weak housing market. 
</P>
<P>
"The apparent steadiness of the economy is an illusion," complained Lawrence A. 
Hunter, an economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "Underlying two years of 
stable unemployment rates are significant job losses in manufacturing and an 
increase in the number of discouraged workers who have dropped out of the job 
market." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the weakness in the June job market, however, other clues in the Labor 
Department report indicated that the U.S. economy might be regaining some 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
The average manufacturing work week remained at a relatively high 41 hours for 
the second month, and overtime held at 3.8 hours, suggesting that factories 
have started to boost output. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, labor costs -- which some central bankers worry may fuel higher 
inflation -- continued to rise, with average hourly earnings moving up to 
$10.01 in June from $9.98 in May. 
</P>
<P>
"Given their worries about inflation being stuck at an unacceptably high level, 
the Fed is likely to do nothing to cut rates," said David Levine, chief 
economist at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. in New York.

RENAULT OFFERS $98 MILLION FOR MACK TRUCKS; 
</P>
<P>
TAKEOVERS: THE FRENCH CAR MAKER ALREADY CONTROLS 44.5% OF THE AILING U.S. FIRM. 
SOME SAY MACK'S SURVIVAL RIDES ON THE DEAL'S SUCCESS.

<P>
French car maker Renault launched a bid Friday worth nearly $100 million to 
take full control of U.S. truck maker Mack Trucks Inc. in an aggressive effort 
to return it to profitability. 
</P>
<P>
Mack announced that Renault, which already controls 44.5% of Mack's shares and 
has warrants and convertible bonds that bring its total stake to 66.1%, wants 
to buy all remaining shares at $6 a share. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, if Renault succeeds, would be worth about $98.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
Mack Chairman Ralph E. Reins said Friday that a plan by Renault Vehicules 
Industriels to buy out Mack's remaining outstanding shares is essential to the 
truck manufacturing company. 
</P>
<P>
Reins, who was attending a Mack board meeting in France, told employees that he 
views Renault's tender offer "to be a very positive development," according to 
Mack spokesman James Santanasto. 
</P>
<P>
Renault's financial and operational support is "crucial to the survival of 
Mack," Reins said. 
</P>
<P>
New York business analyst Charles Harris of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. said Mack had 
been in "a downward spiral in the last 10 years" and said he did not think Mack 
could survive as an independent company. 
</P>
<P>
"This company is dying on the vine and has to do something," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
Mack shares closed at $6.50 in over-the-counter trading Friday, up from $5.25 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Renault, which said it would make its offer July 12, also has $50 million in 
convertible debentures. If exercised and converted with the warrant, the French 
firm's ownership would increase to about 61.1%. 
</P>
<P>
The Renault offer expires Aug. 9 and is conditioned on enough shares being 
tendered to boost its interest in Mack Trucks to at least 90% of the truck 
manufacturer's shares. 
</P>
<P>
Renault, which is owned by the French government but is itself heavily in debt, 
said it was making the offer "because of the continuing deterioration of the 
financial condition of Mack" and the need to restructure the company's debt. 
</P>
<P>
Mack, which lost a record $185.4 million last year and $33.9 million in the 
first quarter of 1990, said it expects a net loss of about $90 million for the 
six months ended June 30. 
</P>

Mack's board, which includes four representatives of Renault, on Friday 
approved a five-year business plan which projects a net loss of about $130 
million for the year ending Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
In a news release, Mack officials said they do not expect the company to show a 
profit before 1992. 
</P>
<P>
Mack officials said the company would probably default on its consolidated, 
three-year revolving bank loans with Citibank of New York and Credit Lyonnais 
of France after its second-quarter results are announced.

Federal Reserve policy-makers concluded in their May meeting that inflation 
posed too great a danger to allow interest rates to decline, minutes of the 
meeting released Friday show. 
</P>
<P>
The 8-week-old records were made available amid signs that the policy-makers 
had decided at their most recent gathering on Monday and Tuesday to shift their 
policy and stand ready to nudge interest rates lower if the economy weakens 
further. 
</P>
<P>
Unidentified government officials were quoted by the Wall Street Journal on 
Friday as saying they believed that the directive adopted earlier this week 
allows a relaxation of the tight credit policy if additional signs of economic 
sluggishness emerge. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts were split over whether the June employment report released Friday by 
the Labor Department provided such evidence. The unemployment rate slipped to 
5.2% from 5.3%, but non-farm job growth was a weaker-than-expected 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
In May, members of the Federal Open Market Committee voted 10-1 to maintain the 
existing credit policy and directed central bank officials to be equally ready 
to raise or lower rates, depending on developments on inflation and economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
Members agreed that "current information on business conditions pointed on 
balance to relatively moderate but sustained economic expansion." At the same 
time, the members "generally agreed that the prospects for significant 
reductions in inflation pressures during the quarters immediately ahead were 
not promising." 
</P>
<P>
Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and a prominent 
advocate of a tough anti-inflation policy, voted against the directive. He 
argued for a tighter credit policy "to help assure that progress would be made 
toward a reduced rate of inflation." 
</P>
<P>
Hoskins said tighter credit would "enhance the credibility and effectiveness of 
monetary policy in countering the persisting strength of inflationary 
pressures," according to the minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Other members, who were not identified, went along with the directive but said 
"the need to contain and ultimately to reduce inflation might well require a 
firming of policy at some point." 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has been fighting inflation with higher interest rates 
since early 1988. In mid-1989 it began nudging rates down amid concern the 
economy might topple into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
However, since late December, the Fed has held steady.

Home Mortgage Rates Down: Fixed-rate home mortgages averaged 10.06% this week, 
down from 10.15% last week, according to a national survey released Friday by 
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, 
lenders were asking an average initial rate of 8.46% this week, up from 8.45% 
the week before. The rates do not include add-on fees known as points.

Rubbish Firms to Merge: GI Industries in Simi Valley, the major trash hauler in 
eastern Ventura County with nearly 50,000 customers, agreed to be acquired by 
Republic Waste Industries Inc. of Houston in a stock swap valued at about $15 
million. The deal is subject to several conditions, including approval by both 
companies' directors and GI's stockholders. GI, led by the Asadurian family, 
which owns 44% of its stock, has suffered losses in recent years because of a 
failed diversification effort.

TOKYO DEVELOPER BUYS SHERATON IN ANAHEIM; 
</P>
<P>
REAL ESTATE: THE HOTEL'S TUDOR-STYLE EXTERIOR WILL BE RENOVATED INTO A 
EUROPEAN-STYLE CASTLE AND VILLAGE.

<P>
A Tokyo land developer, Pacific Islandia Resort Inc., has purchased the 
Sheraton-Anaheim Hotel for $35 million to $40 million and says it plans to 
acquire two more Orange County hotels. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Islandia, through its U.S. subsidiary, Pacific Islandia Guam Inc., 
purchased the 500-room Sheraton-Anaheim from the Maloof family of Albuquerque, 
N.M. The Japanese developer said it plans to renovate the hotel, which opened 
in 1968 and is near Disneyland and the Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
Kaneyoshi Kawamoto, Pacific Islandia's president, said Friday that his firm 
plans to acquire two other hotels in the county to cash in on an increase in 
the Japanese tourist trade. He declined to say which hotels the company is 
considering buying. The Sheraton-Anaheim is the first hotel the firm has 
acquired. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at some hotels in Anaheim and in the South Orange County area," 
said Jeffrey Morse, formerly of the Sheraton Hotel-Newport Beach, who will 
become general manager of the Sheraton-Anaheim. "In addition, we hope to manage 
hotels for other investors in the county and Southern California area." 
</P>
<P>
Kawamoto said the hotel's Tudor-style exterior will be renovated into a 
European-style castle and village. 
</P>
<P>
"Until now, the property has just sat quietly in the shadow of Disneyland," 
Kawamoto said. "We want to take the property out of the shadows and make it 
stand out on its own." 
</P>
<P>
Besides hiring Morse, Kawamoto said, no major changes in the hotel's senior 
management are anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
"The only changes we plan are those in the attitude of the present staff," he 
added. "We plan to make the atmosphere of the hotel into what it should be: a 
place where guests can enjoy themselves thoroughly in their individual rooms 
and in all public places." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Islandia plans to spend an additional $15 million to $20 million for 
renovations, according to a source familiar with the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Maloof, the hotel's former owner, would not comment on the sales price. "We 
thought about selling it in the past," Maloof said, "but didn't have the need 
to until now because they offered a fair price." 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Islandia has formed a company, K &amp; M Hospitality Inc., to manage 
the Sheraton-Anaheim as well as any hotel acquisitions that it makes in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Kawamoto, 44, is also president of Pacific Islandia Resort's parent company, 
Kawamoto Gakuen, an educational services company started by his father in Tokyo 
in 1976. He is also managing director of Tokyo-based Shibuya Educational 
Planning Co., an educational-testing preparation company. 
</P>
<P>
Joanne Soboto, a hotel industry consultant for Laventhol &amp; Horwath in Costa 
Mesa, said Japanese investors have become more interested in acquiring Southern 
California hotels and resorts as tourism from Pacific Rim countries has 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
"The Anaheim-Disneyland area has always been a strong hotel market," she said. 
The acquisition "is good for the Japanese investors because they can coordinate 
better with Japanese tour companies."

JAPAN WILL CUT PRICE IT PAYS RICE FARMERS 
</P>

<P>
The Japanese Cabinet decided Friday to cut by 1.5% the price the government 
will pay farmers for the 1990 rice crop, Agriculture Minister Tomio Yamamoto 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Japan faces mounting international criticism for its refusal to end a ban on 
commercial imports of rice, which it has said is needed to protect farmers from 
cheap imports and to ensure self-sufficiency in Japan's staple food. 
</P>
<P>
The reduction, to an average of 83 cents a pound, was recommended by a ministry 
panel on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The reduction was made with one eye on next week's seven-nation economic summit 
in Houston because it allows Tokyo to say it has taken concrete measures to 
reform its agricultural policies, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
Rice prices in Japan are about six times world levels. 
</P>
<P>
The decision followed the failure of an advisory board made up of consumers and 
farmers to unanimously endorse the cut after a meeting that lasted until late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The advisory board, appointed by the Agriculture Minister, ended up issuing a 
joint statement with a number of different opinions on the price cut and 
Japan's farm policies. 
</P>
<P>
Some members said the cut was too small in light of world prices and showed 
lack of vision in farm policy. Others, mainly producers, said any cut was 
inappropriate, given recent rises in prices and labor costs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is unusual but, in a case like this, the minister has the power to decide 
without the endorsement of the board," an Agriculture Ministry official said. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, another ministry official said the proposed cut was in line with 
lower output costs and the fact that the government has large rice stockpiles. 
It was also aimed at narrowing the gap between domestic and foreign prices, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Japan cut its wholesale rice price for the first time in 31 years in 1987, by 
5.95%. In 1988, it cut the price again, by 4.6%. In 1989, it was left 
unchanged, despite an Agriculture Ministry recommendation that it be cut.

JOBLESS DATA BUOYS MARKET; DOW UP 25.74

<P>
Stock prices rebounded Friday, in the slowest trading of the year, with traders 
encouraged by a government employment report showing underlying strength in the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials climbed 25.74 to 2,904.95, finishing the 
week with a net gain of 24.26. The index fell 32.42 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8-to-5 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 851 up, 537 down and 566 unchanged. 
But Big Board volume dropped to 111.73 million shares from 128.32 million 
Thursday and the lightest total since a 77.61 million-share day on Dec. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts had expected a quiet session because many traders were taking time off 
after Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks rallied on the surprisingly large upward revision in non-farm jobs for 
May, which showed payrolls increasing by 356,000, compared to the 164,000 
previously reported. Analysts said traders were apparently more focused on the 
prospects of better corporate profits than on the diminished chances of an 
interest rate cut. 
</P>
<P>
"That (May) revision eliminated the chance of any near-term Fed easing," said 
MMS International equity analyst Robert Walberg. But investors looked at the 
positive aspects of the jobs report, which indicated that there is still some 
strength in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The stock market had gotten a little worried about second-quarter earnings 
reports, and so it interpreted (the revision) as positive," said Jack Solomon, 
technical analyst at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the strength in the market was centered in recession-resistant firms, 
such as food and drug stocks. General Mills rose 1 7/8 to 90 1/2, Pepsico 
gained 2 1/8 to 79 7/8, Philip Morris jumped 1 3/4 to 49 1/4 and Amgen added 1 
3/4 to 79 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Some industrial stocks were also strong, including Alcoa, up 2 3/8 to 66 1/2; 
Phelps Dodge, up 2 to 64, and Exxon, up 1 to 47 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Other market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* McDonnell Douglas jumped 2 1/2 to 43 3/8, on apparent optimism about the 
company's strong shipments of MD-80 aircraft in the second quarter. McDonnell 
rose 1 7/8 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
* Shoe stocks were big gainers. K Swiss rose 1 3/4 to 26 1/4, Nike jumped 2 to 
80 and Stride Rite rose 2 7/8 to 30 3/8. But LA Gear inched up just 1/8 to 28 
5/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Mack Trucks added 1 1/4 to 6 1/2. Renault of France, which owns about 44.5% 
of Mack, announced plans to make a $6-a-share bid for the rest of the stock. 
</P>
<P>
* Voicemail company Digital Sound of Santa Barbara, which plunged early in the 
week on disappointing earnings news, slipped 1/8 to 4 1/2. Azusa-based Optical 
Radiation lost 1 to 32 1/4, on concern about potential problems with the 
company's new theater sound technology. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed slightly higher in thin 
trading. The Nikkei average gained 93.45 to close at 32,445.12. In London, 
stocks closed higher, buoyed by a good performance on Wall Street. The 
Financial Times 100-share index closed up 8.6 at 2,340.0. 
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, West Germany, the DAX index of 30 leading shares closed at 
1,932.80, up 18.62 in another strong rally.

Bond Prices Slide on Interest Rate Fears 
</P>
<P>
Government bond prices plunged on the news that the nation's unemployment rate 
dropped in June, making it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will ease interest 
rates soon. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year bond fell 1 1/8 point, or $11.25 per $1,000 in face 
amount. Its yield increased to 8.50% from 8.40% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Traders bid bond prices lower in reaction to the unemployment report. William 
Sullivan, analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, said the report "showed a bit more 
buoyancy in the labor force than the market had anticipated." 
</P>
<P>
News of a stronger economy makes it less likely that the Federal Reserve will 
lower interest rates. Lower rates benefit fixed-return investments such as 
bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Gib Clark, chief bond trader for Daiwa Securities Inc., said the unemployment 
report capped a week of figures that were disappointing to the bond market, 
including a report showing auto sales were stronger than expected. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of scotches the thought of Fed easing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Sullivan said, the bond market is under price pressure as it faces 
the auctions of several major new bond issues next week, including $5 billion 
worth of 30-year bonds by the Resolution Funding Corp., the federal agency that 
raises money for the savings-and-loan bailout. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices often soften temporarily as the market anticipates potential 
difficulty in digesting new issues. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight 
loans, was quoted at 8.25%, up from 8% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grain and Soybeans Continue to Drop 
</P>
<P>
Prices of grain and soybean futures plunged for a second straight day as more 
weather forecasters predicted ideal weather next week for Midwestern crop 
development and winter wheat harvesting. 
</P>
<P>
On other commodity markets, pork futures fell sharply, copper climbed, precious 
metals slipped and energy futures were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures settled 5.50 to 10 cents lower, 
with the contract for delivery in July at $3.0925 a bushel; corn was 3.50 to 
8.25 cents lower, with July at $2.80 a bushel; oats were 4.50 to 5 cents lower, 
with July at $1.31 a bushel, and soybeans were 8 to 10.75 cents lower, with 
July at $6.19 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
The selloff extended Thursday's steep losses in the corn and soybean markets as 
it triggered waves of selling by speculators. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, some private forecasters were predicting hot, dry weather 
for the western and southern reaches of the Corn Belt. 
</P>
<P>
But by Friday, "they're all saying the weather's going to be mild with good 
rain in the next week or so, and that is the ball game," said Victor 
Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the grain trading division of Dean 
Witter Reynolds Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Pork futures tumbled on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on selling linked to 
recent high hog slaughter figures and sluggish retail demand, especially for 
bacon. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dollar Mixed After Climbing Overseas 
</P>
<P>
The dollar finished mixed on domestic currency markets after closing higher 
overseas following the release of the better-than-expected U.S. unemployment 
report. 
</P>
<P>
Because the unemployment report suggested that U.S. interest rates won't drop 
soon, some dollar traders anticipated that more foreign investors are likely to 
buy U.S. bonds soon. That would mean more foreign buying of dollars, and thus a 
stronger currency. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose overseas but turned mixed when trading shifted to the United 
States. Dealers said, however, that the much-anticipated employment report 
failed to move the market significantly and activity was relatively thin. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 150.95 yen, down 0.05 yen from Thursday's close. 
Later in London, the dollar was quoted higher at 151.00 yen. In New York, the 
dollar settled at 151.70 yen, up from 150.57 yen on Thursday.

The embarrassment of riches at the Festival International de Jazz leaves no 
idiom untapped. Typically, though contemporary jazz is strongly represented (by 
Elvin Jones, Arthur Blythe, McCoy Tyner, Archie Shepp and dozens more), 
traditional sounds such as the blues are not ignored; in fact, one outdoor 
stage is devoted to daily blues sessions, mainly by French Canadian groups 
(despite such names as The Okazoo Blues Band), while Robert Cray, Dr. John and 
Wilson Pickett have filled indoor halls. 
</P>
<P>
Much ingenuity has been shown in mixing Canadian and American talent. The 
Modern Jazz Quartet joined forces with a Canadian string quartet, the Quatuor 
Morency. Thursday evening the vocal-and-bass duo of Sheila Jordan and Harvey 
Swartz shared a show with singer Karen Young and bassist Michel Donato, a 
Quebec couple who have carried the same idea much further: they both sing; they 
have a fresher, bolder (and bilingual) repertoire, and Young's voice is strong 
and assured. Score one for Canada. Late in the show they switched partners; 
finally all four got together for a joyous two-voice, two-bass hit.

The Latin temperament, a product of the sharp increase in the Spanish speaking 
population here, has been nourished daily by Hilton Ruiz, Milton Nascimento, 
Chick Corea and, most memorably, by singer Celia Cruz, the Cuban-born salsa 
spitfire who, despite a shower that became a heavy storm Tuesday evening, drew 
a crowd estimated at 75,000 to a two block area in the Boulevard Rene Levesque. 
</P>
<P>
On a stage decorated with the flags of Mexico, Cuba and Panama, Cruz shared her 
program with the Venezuelan singer Oscar d'Leon and a 15-piece band. This was 
basically dance music, but dancing became a bit awkward amid a sea of 
umbrellas. A jazz interlude was inserted when the saxophonists David (Fathead) 
Newman and Chico Freeman soloed powerfully on "Blue Bossa." 
</P>
<P>
A cornucopia of pianists Wednesday found Keith Jarrett's recital coinciding 
with that of Michel Camilo, a virtuoso from the Dominican Republic. We chose 
Camilo, who is extraordinary but extravagant; his concert was almost literally 
a smashing success, as he used formidable technique to pound his way through 
original pieces such as the Latinesque "Island Stomp." The brute-force formula 
works for him; he had the crowd in an uproar, but his subtler side (displayed 
in his own gentle "Dans l'Amour") was too seldom heard, and the excesses 
extended to his bassist and the laborious drummer. 
</P>
<P>
At an adjoining theater a little later, the Americans Kirk Lightsey and Harold 
Danko (both Chet Baker alumni) formed a piano duo that aimed not at the jugular 
like Camilo, but at the mind and heart. Their cohesion is fantastic. It is as 
if some higher power were controlling these four hands, making them move as 
one. 
</P>
<P>
The program consisted mainly of intricately arranged tunes by Wayne Shorter 
("Anamaria," "Iris," "Pinocchio"); even when they played a Danko original it 
was entitled "Wayne Shorter." The first 45 minutes was spellbinding, but as 
time wore on the persistent sound of two pianos began to wear thin. 
</P>
<P>
Most rewarding of all was Tommy Flanagan's late evening appearance at the 
Nouveau Monde Theatre. Here was the perfect formula: much better (an 
Ellington-Strayhorn medley), much bebop (tunes by Gillespie, Parker, Thad 
Jones, J.J. Johnson), and no bombast. In George Mraz he has the Tommy Flanagan 
of the bass, whose every solo is a melodic marvel. The wit and empathy of the 
drummer Lewis Nash rounded out this spirited trio. 
</P>
<P>
Among the Canadians heard at free concerts in and around the Rue Ste. Catherine 
were Sylvain Provost, a Pat Metheny inspired guitarist, whose quartet played in 
a large tent off the street; Hans Leveille, a graduate of Los Angeles' Guitar 
Institute, whose sextet pumped out heavy-handed fusion in a giant four-story 
shopping mall; and Streetnix, heard in open air concerts at the Place des Arts. 
Patterned after the Dirty Dozen Band from New Orleans (they are also in the 
festival), Streetnix used an incongruous old time set-up (tuba, trumpet, drums, 
and two young women playing alto sax and trombone) to play tunes by Mingus, 
Bird and Monk. Amazingly, it worked.

JAZZ NOTES: TRIBUTE AWARD TO TRUMPETER CONTE CANDOLI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Conte Candoli, the ace be-bop-style trumpeter who has gained renown working 
with Stan Kenton, Woody Herman, Supersax and Doc Severinsen, has received the 
eighth annual Tribute Award from the Los Angeles Jazz Society, it was announced 
Thursday. Other awards, including the society's Lifetime Achievement Award and 
Educator Award, will be announced later. Candoli will be feted at a banquet at 
the Los Angeles Hilton Hotel and Towers on Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm overwhelmed, to say the least," said Candoli, who joins guitarist John 
Collins, pianist Gerald Wiggins and others in receiving the prestigious honor. 
"This is about jazz, and that's what we all started out to do. We may get 
sidetracked a bit but we always get back to the main thing. I really appreciate 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Candoli -- who will appear July 11 to 13 with drummer Frank Capp at Stingaree 
Gulch in San Pedro -- was 16 years old and living in his native Mishawaka, 
Ind., when he began his career with Herman in the summer of 1945. "My brother, 
Pete, got me that job. As I think back, I owe all of this to Pete," Candoli 
said. "He started me off and was my main influence." 
</P>
<P>
Roy Eldridge and Dizzy Gillespie also served as musical models for the 
trumpeter, who, after working with Kenton from 1952 to 1954, moved to the 
Southland to work with Howard Rumsey's Lighthouse All-Stars at the Lighthouse 
Cafe in Hermosa Beach. There, from 1954 to 1959, he played alongside such 
stalwarts as saxmen Bud Shank and Bob Cooper, trombonist Frank Rosolino and 
pianists Claude Williamson, Sonny Clark and Victor Feldman. 
</P>
<P>
"Stan Levey (ex-Kenton drummer) got me on that gig," recalled Candoli, who will 
turn 63 next Thursday. "I had left Kenton and was back home in Indiana and he 
called me, asking me if I wanted to come out to the Coast. It took me about one 
second to respond. 'You got it!' I told him." 
</P>
<P>
Another job Candoli joyfully remembers was with Shelly Manne at the late 
drummer's jazz haunt, Shelly's Manne-Hole in Hollywood, from 1961 to 1968. 
"Working with Shelly was fantastic," he said. "I had played with him all my 
life, with Woody (Herman) and Stan (Kenton) and at the Lighthouse. But I 
enjoyed working his club the most. Just about anybody that was anybody -- 
Coltrane, Miles, Art Blakey, Shearing, Oscar Peterson -- was there, and we got 
to play opposite them (splitting sets)." 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, Candoli joined Severinsen's "Tonight Show" crew -- a job he called 
"the greatest." 
</P>
<P>
" 'The Tonight Show' enhanced my career," he said. "It made me comfortable, so 
when I go out and play jazz, I'm in a good frame of mind. It gives me a sense 
of security, and that feels good. It certainly never dampened my desire to 
play. I may go on vacation and lay off for a week, but that's about it." 
</P>
<P>
Candoli can also be heard with Bill Berry's L.A. Band at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art at 1:30 p.m. on July 29, and on that same day, with Tommy 
Newsom's Orchestra at Warner Park in Woodland Hills at 5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
PIANIST SCORES MANNE AWARD: Pianist Cecilia Coleman has been selected as the 
recipient of the Shelly Manne Memorial New Talent Award, which, as part of the 
annual LAJS awards, is given to a promising young local musician. Coleman, 27, 
has worked with vibist Charlie Shoemake (she also studied improvisation with 
him), saxman Benn Clatworthy and trombonist Jimmy Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, who has been a professional since the age of 19, is busy this weekend. 
She works with bassist Henry Franklin at the Overland Cafe in Palms tonight and 
with singer Shelly Moore at Coffee and More in Long Beach Sunday. She'll also 
be with Cleveland's octet at the Catalina Bar &amp; Grill in Hollywood on July 
25. 
</P>
<P>
The pianist, who appears on Clatworthy's soon-to-be-released "Thanks, Horace" 
(Discovery), cites Red Garland, Bud Powell, Mulgrew Miller and Benny Green as 
her chief influences. "Those are the ones I most listen to," she said. "I'm 
also very fond of Woody Shaw. If I could play piano like a horn player, I'd 
like to play like him."

<P>
'MAGNETIC YOUTH': VIDEOTAPE AND TEENS ATTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sergio Martinez lowered his head and grinned selfconsciously as videotaped 
images of him talking on the telephone flashed by on a video monitor. Martinez, 
19, endured a few good-natured jabs about his screen image from Lou-ee Munoz 
and Gina Padilla, friends from the Para Los Ninos center in downtown Los 
Angeles, as they sat facing two screens in a cluttered corner of the 
third-floor office of Visual Communications. 
</P>
<P>
Video artist/instructor Gina Lamb joined in the banter, but she quickly 
refocused attention on the work at hand -- introducing the three downtown 
youths to the rudiments of editing videotape. Martinez, Padilla and Munoz have 
never worked with video before, but their maiden voyage in the medium will be 
premiered at Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions on July 29. 
</P>
<P>
That's the final day of the "Magnetic Youth: Teen-Powered TV" exhibit curated 
by Lamb that is running at the downtown facility. The exhibit features 3 hours 
of video work created by teen-age youth working with artists across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"My major goal is to let them know their opinion is important and video is a 
way that people will see it and take notice," said Lamb, who had been doing 
video art work with youth around Los Angeles for five years. For the past two, 
she has been a full-time artist-in-residence at Jefferson High School in South 
Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Video works on a lot of levels. One is that you can use the medium creatively, 
have complete control over it and make this thing that is different from 
television. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives a certain sense of . . . empowerment is this catchword now, but it 
does (apply) with the kids because they can show it to their friends. In a 
sense, they build a certain self-confidence in who they are. It gives them a 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
Lamb, a Baltimore native who moved to Los Angeles in 1984 and received her 
master's degree in fine arts from UCLA in 1987, got the idea for the "Magnetic 
Youth" program when she attended a media arts conference last year that focused 
on education. She found other video artists doing similar work and, when new 
video art curator Adriene Jenik arrived at LACE with a background in education 
and documentaries, the wheels were put in motion. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the "Magnetic Youth" tapes are the work of inner-city youth and fall in 
the documentary vein. The subjects include abortion, media coverage of the 
Bensonhurst killing and Central Park "wilding" attack, rap music and graffiti 
art. "My Three Friends" relates the harrowing escapes of three refugees from 
Cambodia and Vietnam who became friends at Belmont High here. 
</P>
<P>
"My Soul Is . . ." depicts a Living Haiku Society meeting over pizza in a New 
York City school, while "Sundance" is a celebration of nature that is the most 
purely "artistic" of the lot. The most sophisticated is "We Have the Force," 
which combines a cartoon puppet family with documentary footage that shows that 
battling addiction is more complex than "Just Say No" sloganeering. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a really nice tape of Navajo kids talking about their work called 
'Have You Ever Seen a Rainbow at Night?' " said Lamb. "That was professionally 
edited, but the kids shot and narrated it and they come through strongly. 
</P>
<P>
"The work is beautiful. You see the beautiful mountain ranges and then a flying 
carpet with a TV on it that says 'Dynasty.' The kids are really funny -- they 
tell the viewer at the end how they can have an imagination." 
</P>
<P>
Lamb's Para Los Ninos residency, funded by an Artists Projects grant from the 
National Endowment for the Arts, has already had a few ups and downs. One 
participant was grounded, a second who was scheduled to edit didn't show up, 
and a power outage at Visual Communications left the rest working amid a 
jury-rigged maze of extension cords and hot lights. 
</P>
<P>
Sergio Martinez plans to document the contrast between rich and poor sections 
of Los Angeles, and Gina Padilla is doing her individual piece on addiction. 
Lou-ee Munoz, who plans to do a piece on the aesthetic side of graffiti art 
murals, found a connection between video's editing process and the way he mixes 
records as a music deejay. 
</P>
<P>
The Para Los Ninos tape won't be the only new work debuted at the last of the 
LACE exhibit. Lamb's Jefferson High students will also present a documentary on 
the anti-narcotics barricade surrounding their school. 
</P>
<P>
Two recent Jefferson graduates, Teresa Mercado and Irene Esquivel, were helping 
Lamb. Esquivel had been undecided about future plans until she got involved 
last year in a 10-minute documentary on Jefferson graduate and rock 'n' roll 
pioneer Richard Berry, who wrote "Louie Louie." 
</P>
<P>
"The surprising thing was (discovering) that working with video was the thing I 
wanted to do," said Esquivel, who plans to enter Cal State Los Angeles in 
September and major in broadcast and mass media. "The camera is a little box of 
magic where you put your ideas into reality and show them to people. It's 
another form of expression." 
</P>
<P>
It's stories like Esquivel's that give Lamb the most satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"I see myself as a person artist," she said. "I'm interested in people and 
that's why I like working with kids. (It's) like Diane Arbus, going in and 
becoming like your subject, but for me taking it a step further and turning the 
camera over to the subject. For a lot of artists, the youth fill them with 
energy and push them forward so they're learning as much as the kids are."

SPEAKING OUT: DISSENT IN THE CHURCH: 2 VIEWS ON VATICAN INSTRUCTION; 
</P>
<P>
CON: IT SHOWS THE SHIFT TO A MORE CONSERVATIVE VIEW OF THE CHURCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FATHER CHARLES CURRAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The instruction indicates a continuing shift to a more conservative and 
authoritarian understanding of the Catholic Church. It fits into the pattern of 
many recent Vatican declarations and actions. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of contemporary Catholic theologians have recognized at times 
the legitimacy of theological dissent from some non-infallible church teachings 
-- that is, those teachings not at the core of faith. 
</P>
<P>
The instruction disagrees. Dissent, which is described as "public opposition" 
to the teaching office of the church and includes organized dissent and the use 
of the mass media, is forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
A Catholic theologian who, after a loyal effort, cannot accept a non-infallible 
or unchangeable teaching is to make known to church authorities one's 
difficulties, with a prayerful certainty that truth will prevail. 
</P>
<P>
The description of dissent is a caricature. The instruction does not mention 
dissent in theological journals and books, and therefore appears not to accept 
it. 
</P>
<P>
The instruction is a return to the church before the Second Vatican Council of 
the mid-1960s. In the 1950 encyclical, Humani Generis, Pope Pius XII declared 
that whenever the Pope goes out of his way to speak on a disputed issue it is 
no longer a matter for free debate among theologians. The Second Vatican 
Council explicitly rejected such wording in its discussions on the church. 
</P>
<P>
In 1968, U.S. Catholic bishops recognized the legitimacy of public theological 
dissent from non-infallible teaching under three conditions: the reasons are 
serious and grave; the teaching office is not impugned, and no scandal is 
given. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility of such dissent is necessary for the good of the church itself. 
Theology systematically and thematically studies the faith and life of the 
Christian community and tries to understand the word and work of Jesus in the 
light of the ongoing circumstances of time and space. 
</P>
<P>
This attempt to understand more adequately will at times take the form of 
dissent. Theologians will obviously make mistakes, but theological 
interpretation, including the possibility of such dissent, serves the good of 
truth and of the church. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks in part to theological dissent, church teaching has changed on a number 
of positions over the centuries; e.g., the right to silence; slavery; the 
procreative intention in marriage; religious freedom; freedom of conscience; 
interest on loans; critical biblical scholarship; the Catholic Church, and 
salvation. 
</P>
<P>
Dissent has a long track record in the church going back to St. Paul publicly 
disagreeing with St. Peter at Antioch. The Catholic Church would have been much 
better off if more dissenters had protested the Crusades, the witch hunts, the 
failure to recognize local liturgical customs, the exploitation of native 
peoples, and, above all in our time, the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
What will happen? 
</P>
<P>
There are many similarities to the crackdown by the Vatican less than 100 years 
ago that condemned Americanism, modernism and critical biblical scholarship. 
But today it will be difficult to put the toothpaste back into the tube. 
Unfortunately, the credibility of the church will suffer. 
</P>
<P>
Why are we Catholics who firmly believe that faith and reason cannot contradict 
one another still so fearful of the struggle and search for truth? Even the 
Vatican recognizes that we are dealing with matters that are fallible and 
reformable. 
</P>
<P>
 Curran was barred from teaching theology at the Catholic University of America 
in Washington, after his published views in the areas of sexual ethics -- 
especially birth control, abortion, divorce and homosexuality -- were censured 
by the Vatican in 1986. He then taught social ethics at USC until recently, 
when he starting teaching theology at Auburn University. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Photo, Father Charles E. Curran THE ISSUE How much can a Roman Catholic 
theologian disagree with the Pope? A recent instruction from the Vatican 
proclaimed that theologians have no right to dissent publicly from official 
church teachings, even those not considered infallible or based on divine 
revelation. The Times asked two Catholic theologians to present their differing 
views on the controversial issue. From time to time, those involved in 
religious issues will be asked to speak out on their ideas.

THE DROUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
TOP USERS CUT 15% OR MORE WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
Ventura's top 10 water users have all met -- and some have greatly exceeded -- 
reductions in usage mandated by the city's water conservation ordinance, which 
went into effect in mid-April, statistics released Friday show. 
</P>
<P>
Topping the list compiled by the city Public Works Department is Texaco Oil 
Corp., Ventura's third largest user, which reduced its consumption by 52.9% in 
June as compared to the same month last year. Even United Foods, with a 18.6% 
reduction -- the lowest of the top 10 -- exceeded the 15% reduction required by 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Mayor Richard L. Francis commended the top 10 for their efforts but 
warned all water users "not to relax and say 'Hey, we've done it,' and then 
turn around and take a 20-minute shower. The drought's not over . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
The top 10 list includes two oil companies, two hospitals, two mobile home 
parks, the city itself, county facilities in the city, a food company and 
Ventura Community College. The 10 account for just over 15% of the city's 
overall consumption, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
The water conservation ordinance was adopted in March after the City Council 
was warned that four years of drought conditions had depleted the city's 
aquifers. Under the ordinance, government agencies such as the county hospital 
and the city Parks and Recreation Department have to reduce water use by 20%. 
Private enterprises such as oil or food companies have to reduce water use by 
15%. 
</P>
<P>
Residents must limit their water consumption to 196 gallons a day per dwelling 
in mobile homes, apartments and condominiums. Single-family houses are allowed 
up to 294 gallons a day. 
</P>
<P>
Violators in every category are subject to penalties of up to 10 times the 
normal water rate for the excess amount, Green said. 
</P>
<P>
As a whole, the city had reduced water use by 24.6% in June, compared to the 
same month last year, but the goal is 30%. 
</P>
<P>
Public Works Department spokeswoman Carol Green said she believes that goal 
will be reached soon because residential users, who use from 60% to 70% of the 
city's water, will follow in the footsteps of the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
For the big water users, the reductions didn't come easy. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Scheinfurth, manager of the Lemon Wood Mobile Home Park, said reducing 
water consumption 38.2% was painful and costly. Every resident had to pitch in, 
and many attended meetings to learn water-saving tips, Scheinfurth said. 
Recycled water from showers and laundry washes was used to irrigate flower 
gardens. Two decorative fishponds had to be filled with sand. Low-flow showers, 
toilets and faucets were installed in the clubhouse. Landscape irrigation was 
restricted to night hours, and the park's 1,000 lemon trees had to survive with 
less water than usual. 
</P>
<P>
Oil companies had disparate results in their efforts to conserve. Texaco was 
able to cut its water use by 52.9%, but Shell Oil, the city's No. 1 user, only 
reduced consumption by 19.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Texaco spokeswoman Sharon Stakes said the firm spent $6,000 to replace dozens 
of toilets with low-flow models used by the company's 150 field employees. The 
company also did not pump as much water into its wells to flush out oil. 
</P>
<P>
She said Texaco is making up the difference by recycling about 6,000 water 
barrels every day and by activating a water well owned by the company that 
produces 5,000 barrels a day. However, she warned that the company will have to 
use more water in upcoming months as more water pressure is needed in the 
pumping wells. 
</P>
<P>
Shell officials could not be reached late Friday to comment on their reduction. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura city officials said they were particularly impressed with the 
reductions by the two local hospitals, where hygienic standards require 
extensive water use. 
</P>
<P>
Community Memorial Hospital spokeswoman Barbara Milton said the 320-bed 
facility accomplished its 21% reduction by installing aerators into every 
faucet in the building. The aerators, which add air bubbles to the stream of 
water, cut down water flow from 5.6 gallons per minute to 2.2 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital also installed low-flow shower heads, which reduced water flow 
from 7.5 gallons per minute to 3 gallons, and did not water its lawns as often, 
leaving some of them browner, she said. 
</P>
<P>
United Foods Manager Ruben Franco said his mushroom farm saved water by 
retrofitting all showers and toilets and by washing the floors once a week 
instead of every day. While United's 18.6% reduction was the lowest among the 
top 10 users, Franco said he and his 325 company employees are making every 
possible effort to conserve. 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the city government managed a 23.9% cutback by taking measures 
such as installing drip irrigation systems on Johnson Drive, suspending 
landscape irrigation in all the fire stations and installing a computerized 
irrigation system in four city parks. Also, most plumbing fixtures in city 
buildings were retrofitted to consume less water and a massive publicity 
campaign advised city workers to save water.

NEW ZIPS IN THE MAIL FOR MANY BOX HOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEANNA BELLANDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego area is about to undergo its biggest one-time introduction of ZIP 
codes, affecting more than 41,000 post office box holders at 26 post offices. 
</P>
<P>
The ZIP codes of people who have mail delivered directly to their homes or 
businesses will not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
The change, which goes into effect Sept. 1, means that 26 ZIP codes will be 
added, 23 in the city of San Diego and three in the rest of the county, said 
Postal Service spokesman Mike Cannone. There are now 145 ZIP codes assigned in 
the San Diego area, and the last big ZIP code shuffle started Sunday when 
Oceanside got five new codes and Escondido got three. 
</P>
<P>
Growth and an ever-increasing mail supply have forced the Postal Service to 
make these changes. Cannone said 8.3 million pieces of mail are handled daily 
in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"We're running out of numbers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The ZIP code changes are expected to speed up automated mail sorting, and that 
will mean better delivery, said Bill Timms, station manager at the William Taft 
Station at 5052 Clairemont Drive, one of the places affected by the change. 
</P>
<P>
But postal employees don't expect any real hassles. 
</P>
<P>
"It shouldn't be that much of a problem because we're starting to notify people 
now," said Jim Courtney, superintendent at the Poway post office. The change 
will affect Poway's 1,218 post office boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Cannone plans to barrage the affected post-office boxes with flyers reminding 
customers of the upcoming change. 
</P>
<P>
"I've worked very hard at reducing the confusion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service also has a one-year grace period, so it will honor both the 
old and the new ZIP codes during that time, but Cannone said people shouldn't 
wait too long to make the change. The grace period gives businesses and other 
people affected a chance to order stationery and other supplies printed with 
the new ZIP codes. 
</P>
<P>
The Postal Service warns that this isn't the last change in ZIP codes the San 
Diego area will see. In January, a 919 ZIP code will be added, Cannone said. 
ZIP codes in the city start with 921 and in the county with 920. 
</P>
<P>
ZIP CODE CHANGES

<P>
The Sept. 1 ZIP code changes will affect customers who have post office box 
addresses at the following 26 facilities:

STATE TO STUDY DRUG DEATH AT FHP HOSPITAL

<TEXT>
<P>
State health authorities are opening an investigation into the case of an 
elderly cancer patient who died at FHP Hospital in Fountain Valley because of a 
nurse's mistaken infusion of the wrong drug, an official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Times also learned on Friday that the nurse who allegedly made the 
medication error, 37-year-old Maureen Daubert, is working at a VA hospital in 
Lebanon, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief telephone interview, Daubert, a registered nurse, expressed shock 
that details about the incident had become public. She declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
The investigation is being handled by the state Department of Health Services, 
which has jurisdiction over the licensing of California hospitals. Jacqueline 
A. Lincer, the health department's licensing administrator in Santa Ana, said 
she had assigned an investigator to review FHP records and "procedures" 
concerning the care of 74-year-old Francis J. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a horrendous thing that happened, this medication error," Lincer said. 
"But it does on occasion happen." 
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, Van Nuys attorney John L. Moriarity, who represents Johnson's 
family, said he will probably file suit against the hospital to gain access to 
hospital records. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials have confirmed that Johnson died last Nov. 14 after Daubert 
accidentally injected her with potassium chloride instead of following a 
doctor's written order to administer the diuretic Lasix. 
</P>
<P>
Told of the state investigation, FHP associate vice president Anna Marie Dunlap 
said, "That doesn't surprise me." After press reports of the death this week, 
"I think they would feel obligated" to investigate, she said. 
</P>
<P>
FHP issued a statement Thursday calling the nurse's action "an inexcusable 
lapse in judgment" and saying the hospital was cooperating fully with 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
"The nurse's unfortunate mistake is not in any way indicative of the general 
quality of care offered at FHP's hospital," the statement said. It added that 
FHP was conducting its own investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Nurse Daubert has been on staff at the Veterans Administration Medical Center 
in Lebanon, Pa., since May 7, hospital spokesman Steve Gallerizzo confirmed. He 
said the hospital checked Daubert's credentials and was told "there were no 
impairments" to her California nursing license. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, an Anaheim nursing registry rated Daubert's performance from July, 
1988, through this April as "superior," and the nursing director at FHP 
reported that Daubert had left their employment "voluntarily," Gallerizzo said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the FHP nursing director reported Daubert's dates of employment but 
"did not fill out the performance data" that the VA's reference form requested. 
</P>
<P>
FHP officials reiterated Friday that Daubert was fired last November -- seven 
days after Johnson's death -- because she made an "egregious error," allegedly 
grabbing the wrong medication from a shelf and injecting Johnson with it. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Dunlap said, "in keeping with the laws governing employee rights to 
privacy," the hospital may not have told a potential employer that Daubert was 
fired but rather only "confirmed the name, dates of employment and position the 
employee held." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson suffered cardiac arrest and died 40 minutes after the wrong medicine 
was administered, deputy coroner Bruce Lyle has said. 
</P>
<P>
Although FHP physician Dr. Sabry Ghaly signed a Nov. 15 death certificate 
attributing Johnson's demise to "metastatic breast cancer," the coroner's 
office on Thursday formally amended that document, saying the cause of 
Johnson's death was "acute potassium intoxication." 
</P>
<P>
In its Thursday statement, FHP said its own investigation had found it 
difficult to determine Johnson's exact cause of death because "any one of 
several acute problems could have been at fault, including septic shock, 
massive heart failure and terminal cancer beyond treatment." 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley police inspector Steven J. Williams has been investigating 
circumstances surrounding the death. He said Friday that he plans to question 
FHP doctors and nurses involved in treating Johnson next week and plans to 
present his findings to the district attorney's office later this month. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, an official at the California Board of Registered Nursing has 
confirmed that Daubert has been under investigation since January. She said a 
recommendation could be submitted to the attorney general's office for civil 
action within a month. 
</P>
<P>
But for now, Daubert's "license is still clear" because no formal accusation 
has been filed against her, said Susan Brank, the board's assistant executive 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
Brank noted that any hospital checking on Daubert's background would probably 
not be told that she was under investigation. "It would not become public 
information until the complaint was substantiated," Brank said. 
</P>
<P>
Details of Daubert's background remained sketchy Friday. But Brank said Daubert 
has held an active, and unblemished, registered nursing license in California 
since September, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, she was licensed as a registered nurse in Massachusetts from 
1980-1984, where she earned her nursing degree from Springfield Technical 
Community College in 1980. No complaints were on file against her there, a 
spokeswoman for that state's nursing board said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Daubert does not appear to hold a nursing license in Pennsylvania, 
federal law does not require that, said VA spokeswoman Donna St. John. She said 
federal law only requires that a VA nurse hold a nursing license from any 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Commenting further on the state health department's investigation, licensing 
chief Lincer said her agency is not empowered to impose fines on a hospital or 
its owner, but could, in an extreme situation, suspend or revoke a facility's 
license to operate.

WILD FREEWAY CHASE, GUNFIGHT ENDS IN ARREST

A man suspected of beating a taxicab driver and stealing his cab was wounded in 
a gun battle with police Friday morning after shooting at law enforcement 
authorities during a harrowing chase on the crowded San Diego Freeway, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The chase ended when the suspect sped over a center divider on a congested 
Laguna Hills intersection, blowing out two tires, and then fled into a deep 
ravine, where he hid behind a clump of trees and continued to shoot at 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
Miraculously, law enforcement officials said, no one except the suspect was 
injured during the 25-mile chase or the subsequent 10:30 a.m. shoot-out in the 
ravine at Moulton Parkway and Laguna Hills Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"Luck was definitely on our side," Irvine Police Lt. Vic Thies said. "This guy 
fired so indiscriminately, it was extremely fortunate that no one else was 
hit." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine police identified the suspect as Ronald K. Trotter, 29, of Stanton. A 
single shotgun blast, fired by an Orange County sheriff's deputy, hit Trotter, 
said Irvine Lt. Mike White. 
</P>
<P>
Trotter was listed in critical condition at Mission Hospital Regional Medical 
Center after undergoing surgery Friday afternoon, hospital spokeswoman Nancy 
Gasho said. 
</P>
<P>
Also injured was the taxicab driver, who fought with Trotter and tried to wrest 
the gun from him before the cab was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
"I was frightened that he would kill me and I was mad," said the cabdriver, 
Valery Yakubov. "I held the (suspect's) gun with one hand and hit him with the 
other. I hit him and he hit me. I hit him in his face over and over. . . . 
There was blood everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
The gun fired once during the struggle, but Yakubov was not hit. He said the 
suspect then pointed the gun at him and possibly pulled the trigger again, but 
the gun jammed. Yakubov then escaped. 
</P>
<P>
Police described Trotter as a muscular man who wore a black hat, jacket and 
pants. 
</P>
<P>
This was the fifth officer-involved shooting in Orange County this year. A 
sixth shooting involving Orange County officers occurred in Los Angeles County 
last month when a Fullerton narcotics officer and a drug suspect were killed in 
a shoot-out during an undercover operation in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office is investigating Friday's shooting 
because it involved law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's shooting ended a half-hour car chase at speeds of up to 75 m.p.h. that 
took the suspect, Irvine police, California Highway Patrol, Orange County 
sheriff's deputies and an Anaheim police helicopter on a journey from Irvine to 
the South County community near the Laguna Hills Mall. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began shortly before 10 a.m., when Yakubov, 29, of Anaheim, was 
called to pick up a customer at John Wayne Airport, said Coast Yellow Cab 
Cooperative operations manager Thom Pelk. 
</P>
<P>
After picking up his fare, Pelk said, Yakubov drove the man to at least two and 
possibly three locations, Pelk said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know what those addresses are, but after two or three times of doing 
this, he (the suspect) pulled a gun on the cabbie," Pelk said. 
</P>
<P>
At the intersection of Morse and Von Karmann avenues, the two got into a 
scuffle. The suspect then pulled out a .45-caliber automatic handgun and 
pointed it at Yakubov's head, Pelk said. 
</P>
<P>
Yakubov did not radio for help. 
</P>
<P>
"I imagine he was in a rather precarious position with a gun pointed at him," 
Pelk said. 
</P>
<P>
During the fight, the cabdriver grabbed for the gun, which fired. The bullet 
missed Yakubov, but he sustained gunpowder burns to his arm. Yakubov, a 
Ukrainian immigrant who has worked for the cab company for two months, was 
taken to Healthcare Medical Center of Tustin, where he was admitted overnight 
for a broken rib and facial cuts suffered in the scuffle. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Yakubov on the street, Trotter then headed for the congested San 
Diego Freeway, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, Irvine police officers spotted the taxi traveling southbound on 
the freeway near Irvine Center Drive, Thies said. Two Irvine police squad cars 
followed the suspect as he sped southbound, whipping past slower cars on the 
congested freeway. Within minutes, California Highway Patrol cars joined the 
chase. 
</P>
<P>
When the pursuit reached El Toro Road, the suspect began firing his gun out the 
driver's window, missing police and other drivers, Thies said. 
</P>
<P>
Lyle Edwards, 52, of Mission Viejo was on the freeway when he spotted the 
lights of at least four squad cars flashing in his rear-view mirror. 
</P>
<P>
Then he noticed a yellow taxicab "whip by on the left. He wasn't more than two 
cars in front of me," Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'My gosh, they (police) are chasing this guy,' " Edwards said. At that 
point, Edwards was startled by what sounded like an explosion. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw his rear window shatter and explode," Edwards said. "I couldn't believe 
it. Nobody could. It happened so quickly and everybody (drivers) just tried to 
get out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
The suspect finally got off the freeway at Avery Parkway and led the growing 
number of pursuing squad cars through several Laguna Hills neighborhoods. 
Meanwhile, an Anaheim police helicopter had been called in to keep an eye on 
the suspect from the sky. 
</P>
<P>
James Jones, 28, of Anaheim, said he was waiting for the light to change at the 
intersection of Moulton Parkway and Laguna Hills Drive when he saw the taxicab 
careening down the street toward him at about 60 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"He was coming right at me," said Jones. 
</P>
<P>
As the cab reached the intersection, it sped over the center divider in an 
attempt to make a left turn on Laguna Hills Drive. While airborne, the rear 
tires exploded. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect skidded to a stop, jumped out and fled into a deep ravine covered 
with high brush and trees. 
</P>
<P>
"The taxi was still rolling," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
As the Anaheim police helicopter circled the area, an officer using a 
loudspeaker warned the suspect to throw down his weapon. More than a dozen 
squad cars from Irvine and the Sheriff's Department converged and blocked off 
the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
"Cops were piling out of their cars with lots of weapons," said witness Debbi 
Barton, who was also in her car at the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
Moments later, as police closed in, the suspect reportedly began firing again 
from behind a clump of trees. 
</P>
<P>
At least one sheriff's deputy returned the fire, but "none of our officers 
fired," Irvine's Lt. White said. 
</P>

CURB ON NEWS RACKS MAY BE WIDENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A year-old city ordinance that restricts sidewalk displays of publications 
deemed obscene may soon be extended to include racks inside stores. 
</P>
<P>
An amended ordinance that the City Council introduced this week would require 
all "harmful matter" sold in convenience stores and other shops to be placed 
inside racks that block from view at least the lower two-thirds of the 
material. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike last year's ordinance, which touched off a feud between anti-pornography 
crusaders and free-speech activists, the proposed new law has slid into the 
legislative process virtually unnoticed, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
No one spoke for or against the proposal at last Monday's council meeting as 
the ordinance was introduced. And Margaret Kleckner, the city code enforcement 
officer who a year ago fielded a flurry of calls from residents on opposing 
sides of the issue, said she has received no comments this time around. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance would prohibit store owners from openly displaying 
magazines or newspapers considered "harmful" under state guidelines. Many 
distributors of the targeted publications have already sent out blinder racks 
to stores carrying their material, Deputy City Atty. Sarah Lazarus said. 
</P>
<P>
"This (proposal) is in line with state law as a way of covering up allegedly 
offensive material so it is out of view from children . . . but it doesn't 
require stores to keep it completely out of sight," Lazarus explained. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed ordinance, which council members will consider for adoption July 
16, would also allow city code-enforcement officials to enter private 
businesses to make sure that the law is being followed. 
</P>
<P>
Violators could be fined up to $1,000 and sentenced to as much as six months in 
jail, according to the draft ordinance. Store owners could be charged with a 
separate offense for each day they failed to comply with the rule. 
</P>
<P>
The "harmful matter" statute that the city enacted in July, 1989, mandated 
blinder racks for all sidewalk displays. 
</P>
<P>
It also limited to eight the number of newspaper racks that could be located 
within a 200-yard stretch of a public right of way, and established guidelines 
to determine which publications would have priority for street-side display. 
Those guidelines effectively prohibited many of the targeted publications from 
being sold on the street, Lazarus said. JOHN PENNER

VOLUNTARY WATER SAVING IS REQUESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council, calling for a voluntary conservation effort, has passed an 
ordinance asking residents to reduce water consumption by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
"Residents are asked to cut their usage by 10% any way they can," city public 
information officer Mike Maxfield said. 
</P>
<P>
"Water conservation kits and a list of suggestions are available at the finance 
desk at the civic center." 
</P>
<P>
If the voluntary effort does not produce the desired reduction, and if the 
drought continues, Maxfield said, the city may be forced to regulate the times 
and dates of lawn watering. 
</P>
<P>
The city has not set a time frame for evaluating whether the voluntary effort 
is successful. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they might also regulate water usage by prohibiting the 
washing of cars and the hosing down of sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
Maxfield said the city will use July, 1989, water usage as a baseline for 
determining cutback levels. 
</P>
<P>
If mandatory cutbacks are initiated, that usage will probably also be used to 
establish penalties for residences that don't achieve a 10% reduction. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be some sort of appeal process for those who have already cut back 
usage," Maxfield added. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

COUNCIL LETS VOTERS DECIDE ON PARK PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has decided not to seek a bond issue in the Nov. 6 election 
but instead to have a referendum on what voters want built in Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
The council dropped the bond issue option this week after failing to agree on 
financing major projects proposed for the park, including a youth sports 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman John Erskine had pushed for getting a bond issue on the Nov. 6 
ballot. He contended the city has scores of building projects that should be 
financed by bonds, rather than the city's hard-pressed general fund. 
</P>
<P>
But after failing to get agreement from five of the City Council's seven 
members -- the minimum needed to put a bond issue on the ballot -- Erskine 
instead opted for an advisory vote by residents on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
The council at its July 16 meeting will decide what proposals to submit to the 
voters in the Nov. 6 "wish list" referendum. The possible list includes 
improvements to the equestrian trail in Central Park, removal of methane gas 
from a landfill adjoining the park and financing for a youth sports complex. 
</P>
<P>
A coalition of parents of gymnasts, Little League baseball players and soccer 
players has been urging the City Council to use some undeveloped Central Park 
land for a multi-use sports complex for youngsters. The proposed youth sports 
complex would have a building for the gymnasts and playing fields for baseball 
and soccer. 
</P>
<P>
Councilmen Don MacAllister and Wes Bannister voiced strong support for the 
youth sports complex. 
</P>
<P>
"Huntington Beach does less for its small kids than most other cities," 
Bannister said. "We provide activities for the adults and teen-agers, but we 
don't do much for the small kids." 
</P>
<P>
MacAllister said that in previous years, the City Council has voted to put 
baseball fields and other youth sports facilities into Central Park. But the 
city staff "has sat on its hands" and failed to implement the council's 
instructions, MacAllister contended. 
</P>
<P>
By a 4-3 vote, the council designated a portion of Central Park as the proposed 
site for a youth sports complex. The site is undeveloped park land on the west 
side of Golden West Street, at the intersection of Talbert Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Financing for the proposed youth sports complex remains unsettled, however, and 
the question is likely to be among the items in the Nov. 6 advisory vote. BILL 
BILLITER

DISABLED URGE BUDGET CUT PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Disabled people joined forces this week to protest Gov. George Deukmejian's 
proposed budget cuts by urging Orange County residents to call their state 
lawmakers and voice their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Employees at the Dayle McIntosh Center for the Disabled in Anaheim, many of 
whom are themselves disabled, asked local officials and supporters to lend a 
hand at the telephone campaign by calling state representatives. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a real swell of support," said Brenda Permo, executive director 
of the center, who estimated that at least 100 people have participated in the 
campaign. The center prepared a one-page fact sheet detailing the budget cuts 
and their effect on the center in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The center has operated in Anaheim for 13 years, helping disabled people from 
throughout the county to get job training, find work and live independently. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed budget cuts would trim about $375,000 off the center's annual 
budget of $1 million, which could cause the center to lay off about one-third 
of its employees, said Premo. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take away a center, you take away all the structural support and you're 
going to put people into institutions," said Premo. "And unless we're going to 
let people die, or put them on the streets, it's going to cost a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
Premo said that institutionalizing disabled people in board-and-care and 
nursing homes would cost about twice as much as it does for a disabled person 
to live independently with the part-time care of a nursing aide. 
</P>
<P>
There are 25 Dayle McIntosh Centers in the state, and about 15 are expected to 
close if the proposed budget cuts are passed, Premo said. The Anaheim location, 
primarily because of local private support, would not be closed, officials 
said. LISA MASCARO

SCHOOLS HIRE HEAD OF SUPPORT SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard L. Donoghue will replace John Perry as assistant superintendent of 
support services for the Orange Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
Donoghue, who has been assistant superintendent of business services for Pomona 
Unified since 1984, signed a contract earlier this week for a starting salary 
of $94,700, about $5,000 over the listed salary. Benefits include three weeks 
of vacation and an expense account of $400 each month. 
</P>
<P>
School board President Jeff Holstien explained the higher salary offer as "the 
amount of dollars needed to get Mr. Donoghue to leave a rather comfortable 
position in Pomona where he had everything under control to come into a 
district where, I would say, things are in a bit of a disarray financially. 
</P>
<P>
"The district has to allocate dollars to bring in top-notch people who can 
bring this district back where it belongs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Unified has been beset by financial instability and charges of fiscal 
mismanagement in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Holstien said Donoghue had an "excellent reputation" in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"He gets things done, he solves problems and he does so in a 
non-confrontational manner," Holstien said. Donoghue's predecessor, Perry, was 
highly critical of board policies and resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Donoghue said about a year ago that a mutual friend introduced him to the 
Orange Unified's newly appointed superintendent, Norman Guith. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I knew the superintendent I thought we might be able to make a 
difference," Donoghue said. "We seem to be on the same philosophical page." 
</P>
<P>
"Orange did not get into trouble overnight and its problems can't be solved 
overnight," Donoghue said. "It's like the guy who asked, 'How do you eat an 
elephant?' . . . One bite at a time." 
</P>
<P>
Donoghue will join Orange Unified immediately on a part-time basis and will 
begin full-time duties about the first of next month. 
</P>
<P>
The Pomona school district serves about 26,500 students, comparable to Orange 
Unified's enrollment of about 24,000. Both districts have budgets of about $105 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Donoghue was assistant superintendent of business services for the East 
Whittier City School District from 1977 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
He received a master's degree in education from the University of Southern 
California in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Donoghue, 45, came to California from Washington in 1959. He and his wife 
Melody live in Arcadia with their three children. MARY HELEN BERG

PETITIONS PREPARED TO KEEP SEAT VACANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of Irvine residents intent on preventing Mary Ann Gaido from filling an 
open City Council seat plans to file petitions Monday to keep the seat vacant 
until it can be filled in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
Gaido, the third-highest vote-getter in the June city election, qualifies to 
fill the remaining two years of Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan's term when 
Sheridan steps in to the mayor's seat. 
</P>
<P>
Gaido, the city Planning Commission chairwoman, lost to Art Bloomer and Barry 
J. Hammond, who won two open council seats. 
</P>
<P>
In the past several weeks, the group has collected 2,900 signatures. This 
weekend, about 35 residents will canvass shopping centers in a final push for 
3,861 signatures, or 7% of the city's 55,163 registered voters, that are 
required to force a special election, said Christina L. Shea. 
</P>
<P>
Shea led last November's efforts to repeal a sexual-orientation clause from 
Irvine's anti-discrimination law, a voter initiative called Measure N. 
</P>
<P>
Measure N supporters are credited with providing Sheridan enough votes to 
defeat incumbent Mayor Larry Agran. However, Sheridan opposes the petitions and 
would like to see Gaido seated. Although members of the group believe Gaido is 
too liberal, Shea said, the group also wants the voters to decide who fills the 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a July 15 deadline to collect signatures, Shea said the group wants to 
turn the petitions over to the City Council before it can vote to certify 
election results Tuesday, which would automatically seat Gaido to complete 
Sheridan's term. The council will meet at 4 p.m. Tuesday to consider certifying 
the election, ordinarily a routine matter, but recently made complex by 
conflicting sections of the city's election law, which was amended by voters in 
June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Once the council certifies the election, two council members whose terms are 
ending -- Cameron Cosgrove and Edward A. Dornan -- will leave office, and Gaido 
moves into Sheridan's council seat. Because of glitches in the election law, 
Bloomer and Hammond are not allowed to assume office until July 20, and 
Sheridan can't take her seat as mayor until July 13, the day after Agran's term 
officially ends. 
</P>
<P>
The council has been discussing how to bridge this gap when outgoing council 
members leave and newly elected members take over. 
</P>
<P>
The council delayed certifying the election results on June 26 after the city 
attorney and a pair of attorneys hired to review the city election laws 
disagreed over the best action. 
</P>
<P>
A special meeting scheduled June 30 was canceled because the attorneys could 
not agree when the results should be certified and how to solve the 
term-of-office gap. TOM McQUEENEY

TUSTIN MAY REZONE AREA FOR HIGHER DENSITY 
</P>

TUSTIN 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Planning Commission on Monday will consider rezoning a recently annexed 
strip of residential property to allow higher density. 
</P>
<P>
When the 2.3 acres at Holt and Warren avenues was annexed in 1989, some North 
Tustin residents opposed it, predicting that Tustin would rezone it to allow 
multifamily units instead of the five single family homes that are there now. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those same people oppose the rezoning, and the city's Planning 
Department has received several letters and phone calls about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
"This will be a test case as to Tustin's philosophy on (rezoning) as far as 
residential property goes," said one of the opponents, Bill Weber, president of 
the Foothill Communities Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The city planning staff has recommended denial of the zoning change, which 
would require an amendment to the General Plan. In a report to the Planning 
Commission, staff members wrote that reclassifying the property is inconsistent 
with the General Plan and could affect future proposals to annex North Tustin 
properties.

THAR SHE STINKS! WHALE CARCASS DECOMPOSING IN S. LAGUNA COVE

<P>
The badly decomposed body of a whale that washed ashore Friday for the second 
time this week is stuck in a tiny, inaccessible cove, causing consternation 
among county and city officials over how to remove the carcass before it 
creates a health threat. 
</P>
<P>
Worried that bacteria from the 15-foot whale could contaminate county-run West 
Street and Thousand Steps beaches just one-third of a mile away, officials are 
hoping that high tides will float the carcass back out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to leave it there" for now, Jim Huston, assistant director of the 
county environmental health department, said late Friday. "We can't get any 
equipment in to remove it, and there isn't enough sand there to bury it." 
</P>
<P>
The shallow, 50-foot-wide cove, below homes on Sea Cliff Drive, is surrounded 
by 75-foot-high, sheer rock faces and cannot be reached on foot, said John 
Thomas, a resident of the area. 
</P>
<P>
The head and trunk of the mammal, believed to be either a blue or sei whale, 
turned up in the rocky cove late Thursday afternoon, Thomas said. Since then, 
its stench has been wafting up into South Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguards originally spotted the remains Wednesday at nearby Laguna Royale 
beach, said Mike Gaughan, director of U.S. Ocean Safety, which provides 
lifeguard service at county-operated beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday crowds made it impossible to bury or remove the badly decomposed 
carcass, so lifeguards closed off that portion of the beach and kept swimmers 
out of the water nearby, Gaughan said. That evening, high tides washed the 
carcass back out to sea. 
</P>
<P>
Early Thursday, the whale's body was spotted floating by employees of the 
county Harbors, Beaches and Parks Department. When they tried to tow it farther 
out to sea, the carcass began breaking apart and eventually entered the cove. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach public works employees are ready to aid the removal, although 
county and city officials late Friday were not sure which jurisdiction is 
responsible. The cove is in the city but lies between two county-run beaches.

ALL-STAR FOOTBALL: QUARTERBACK MISSED PRACTICES TO ATTEND A DINNER, BUT TAKES

<P>
Steve Stenstrom of El Toro High School waited and watched on the sidelines at 
the Orange County all-star football game Friday night at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
While starting quarterback Danny O'Neil of Mater Dei and reliever Donnie Smith 
of Edison had only marginal success in the first half, Stenstrom took it all 
in, waiting for the second half to begin. 
</P>
<P>
Only then would he trot onto the field. Stenstrom missed three practices and a 
scrimmage last weekend to attend a scholar-athlete banquet in Chicago and South 
Coach Dave White started O'Neil. 
</P>
<P>
"It was weird sitting on the sidelines," said Stenstrom, who passed for 4,604 
yards in two seasons at El Toro. "All I did was watch the first half," which 
ended with the North leading, 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
When the third quarter began, Stenstrom's task was to pick up the South. It was 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
Using simple, play-action passes that froze the North defenders, Stenstrom 
completed 9 of 11 for 108 yards and one touchdown to lead the South to a 22-9 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Stenstrom, named the game's most valuable offensive player, had 99 yards in the 
third quarter, leading the South to touchdowns on its first two drives. A 
nine-yard touchdown pass play to Brian Higgins of Edison and a two-point 
conversion pass to Doug Cunningham gave the South a 14-3 lead with 1:43 left in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
He completed his first six passes on those drives, before his seventh pass was 
tipped at the line of scrimmage and fell incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
The scoring pass to Higgins was typical of the South's second-half game plan. 
</P>
<P>
A 15-yard completion to Kealii Clifford of Mater Dei gave the South a first 
down at the North nine. 
</P>
<P>
On the next play, Stenstrom stopped the North rush with a fake handoff, then 
rolled left into the clear. Meanwhile, Higgins was all alone in the back of the 
end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"Danny had to go out there and learn (what the North was doing) on his own," 
said Stenstrom, who will attend Stanford next fall. "In the second half, we got 
the play-action passes going." 
</P>
<P>
And he shredded the defense, repeatedly finding his receivers had beaten the 
North secondary. 
</P>
<P>
The largest gain was a 24-yard gain to Higgins that set up the South's first 
touchdown, a three-yard run by Clifford with 6:51 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The North had no answer for Stenstrom's short passing. 
</P>
<P>
"You're in a world of hurt if you can't pressure the quarterback," said North 
Coach Tom Meiss of Orange. "Our coverage was reasonably good, but you can't 
cover (receivers) for five minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham figured it was only a matter of time before the South began 
clicking. 
</P>
<P>
"You're playing with all these good players," he said. "It was hard to get the 
jitters out. We hadn't played in six months." 
</P>
<P>
Cunningham, who played running back, defensive back and split end, proved to be 
as valuable as he was versatile. 
</P>
<P>
He rushed for 53 yards on five carries and caught three passes for 48 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"In the second half, everyone started picking it up," Cunningham said. "The 
line started blocking better." 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, spending 24 minutes watching from the sidelines seemed to help 
Stenstrom. 
</P>
<P>
"Steve saw it and it was obvious what we had to get done," said O'Neil, who 
completed all four of his first quarter passes for 53 yards. "We ran the 
play-action and the receivers ran good patterns."

<P>
South Coach Dave White invented a whole new way to win the Orange County High 
School All-Star football game Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
He waited until the third quarter to play his best quarterback, Steve Stenstrom 
of El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Stenstrom made White look wise, coming off the bench to complete nine of 11 
passes for 108 yards and a touchdown as the South cruised by the North, 22-9, 
before an estimated 7,500 spectators at LeBard Stadium. The North still leads 
the series, 16-13-2. 
</P>
<P>
Stenstrom, who is headed to Stanford on a football scholarship, sat out the 
first half while Mater Dei's Dan O'Neil and Edison's Donnie Smith shared time 
at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil earned the start when Stenstrom missed three practices last week while 
attending a scholar-athlete banquet in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Stenstrom started the second half, completing his first five passes for 60 
yards and setting up a three-yard touchdown run by Mater Dei's Kealii Clifford. 
Matt Logan missed the extra point and the South took a 6-3 lead with 6:51 left 
in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Stenstrom, the game's offensive most valuable player, completed his first six 
passes and had 99 yards passing in the third quarter. His two incompletions 
were tipped by defenders. 
</P>
<P>
"He came out hot in the third quarter," White said. "All three of our 
quarterbacks did a great job. Each got to play a quarter, and I told them the 
best one would get to play the fourth." 
</P>
<P>
That was Stenstrom, who also led the South to a score on its second possession 
of the third quarter, throwing a nine-yard touchdown pass to Brian Higgins of 
Edison with 1:43 left. He completed a pass to Huntington Beach's Doug 
Cunningham for the two-point conversion and a 14-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Clifford scored his second touchdown by accident, recovering a fumble in the 
end zone by Cunningham, who lost the ball at the two-yard line after a 23-yard 
run. Cunningham completed a pass to Vince Tauanuu of Westminster to give the 
South a 22-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The North capped the scoring when Gary Bladow of Villa Park scored on a 
one-yard run with 2:16 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
While Stenstrom shined, North quarterback Todd Gragnano struggled, completing 
12 of 22 passes for 88 yards with one interception. 
</P>
<P>
"Gragnano's got a great arm but we did a good job pressuring him," White said. 
"He was throwing on the run a lot." 
</P>
<P>
North Coach Tom Meiss said his team couldn't establish a running game, and the 
South clamped down on the North's passing attack. The South held Coy Collins of 
Loara to 28 yards in six carries and Erik Mitchell of Los Alamitos to 21 yards 
in seven carries. 
</P>
<P>
"The South didn't respect our play-action (pass) and there was a lot of 
pressure on Gragnano," Meiss said. 
</P>
<P>
That pressure came early and often. 
</P>
<P>
After a scoreless first quarter, the North opened the second period with a 
61-yard drive, highlighted by a 23-yard run by Chris Shockley of Pacifica, that 
gave the South a first down on the one. 
</P>
<P>
But on the next play, Gragnano fumbled the snap and Mitchell recovered at the 
eight. Two plays netted four yards, setting up a 21-yard field goal by Dave 
Knorr of Orange with 6:25 left in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Gragnano made another costly mistake late in the second quarter. His pass over 
the middle was intercepted at the South 47 by the South's David Morris of 
Saddleback with 34 seconds left in the half. Morris returned it to the North's 
16. 
</P>
<P>
Smith then threw to Cunningham for 10 yards, giving the South a first down at 
the six with 18 seconds left. After two incompletions, Smith's pass over the 
middle on third down was tipped by the North's Scott Strini of Orange and 
intercepted in the end zone by Ron Papazian of Whittier Christian. 
</P>
<P>
Papazian returned it to the North's 10, and Gragnano ran out the clock on the 
next play. 
</P>
<P>

history, was honored at halftime with a framed drawing . . . Esperanza's Keith

A NIGHT OF MUSICAL HORROR AND CRUDITY

<P>
If you don't have any ideas, try a gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
That seems to be the principle behind Johnny Monster and the Nightmares. The 
San Clemente band has gained some popularity on the local rock circuit by 
taking musical styles and a coarse, rowdy attitude that come straight from the 
frat house, and relocating them to the haunted house. 
</P>
<P>
The four-member schlock-horror band's show Wednesday night at Club Postnuclear 
was a monstrous mishmash, just the sort of mutation of entertainment you get 
when a gimmick goes groping around without an idea in its head. 
</P>
<P>
The gimmick, in this case, seems to be to reincarnate the nasty but funny ghoul 
of "Beetlejuice" as a farcical rock singer. But achieving that would require a 
front man with the imagination and acting ability to forge a true persona 
incorporating some snide wit. Acting was beyond Johnny Monster (his real name 
is David Paskowitz). Even parody would require more consideration than this 
band could muster. About all this Monster could manage was crude horsing 
around. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Paskowitz horses around with a good deal of energy may account 
for the band's having found an audience. The wiry singer often jumped onto the 
floor with the pit denizens, slam-dancing with abandon as the band thrashed 
away punk-style. The physical contact took a more worrisome turn when Paskowitz 
pinned a woman in the audience to the floor in imitation of a sexual assault. 
All in good fun, right? Just a stage buffoon making like he's Mr. Hyde? Maybe, 
but what if the next person Paskowitz tackles doesn't see the joke, the way his 
unsuspecting Postnuclear victim apparently did? 
</P>
<P>
The musical side of the routine called for Paskowitz to bellow theatrically in 
imitation of Vincent Price while delivering inane verses on mock-ghoulish 
themes that got no better than this: 
</P>
<P>
 Going to a lifeless luau 
</P>
<P>
 You're a corpse, you're invited. 
</P>
<P>
 Going to a lifeless luau 
</P>
<P>
 Where the dead get excited. 
</P>
<P>
Paskowitz does have a capacious set of pipes, and he frequently showed off his 
lung power with falsetto screams that most heavy-metal bleaters would envy. At 
certain moments, he generated some force, leading one to think there might be a 
real rock singer underneath all that melodramatic Grand Guignol posing and 
mannered B-movie vocal phrasing. 
</P>
<P>
It was hard to tell whether there was potentially a real rock band under the 
blanket of stage smoke and sonic murk that tends to envelope Postnuclear. When 
audible, guitarist John Fields spun out a tuneless metallic screech, while 
drummer Sean Spencer and bassist Shane Anderson played to garage-band standards 
on songs that borrowed from surf music and R&amp;B. 
</P>
<P>
Tender Fury was by far the more rewarding band on this double-bill. Singer Jack 
Grisham is no stranger to stage gimmickry, dating back to the early 1980s, when 
he fronted the original T.S.O.L. (which, incidentally, managed in the 
necrophiliac fantasy, "Code Blue," to convey the sort of crude but pointedly 
satiric wit that eludes Johnny Monster). Grisham resorted to one of his old 
tricks midway through the half-hour set, lowering his pants a la Jim Morrison 
to reveal his leopard-spotted underwear. But he quickly hitched up his trousers 
and got on with the show. 
</P>
<P>
Grisham's singing was drowned out in a poor mix through most of the show, 
emerging only on the last two numbers. While he never has had the bite and 
power of a top-grade rock singer, Grisham compensates with personality that 
comes through in his theatrical, almost vaudevillian drawl. In the past, he has 
sometimes taken shows as a lark, joking his way through performances. But 
Grisham, who says he has changed old ways by quitting substance abuse, 
performed with focus and intensity. 
</P>
<P>
It was the playing, rather than the singing, that carried this performance. 
Hunt Sales, the drummer from David Bowie's band, Tin Machine, kept up a fast, 
fiery pace (Sales, who produced Tender Fury's current album, "Garden of Evil," 
has been sitting in as the band's stage drummer since early this year). 
Guitarist Daniel Root stayed in step with Sales, churning out hard, slab-like 
riffs and feedback-drenched solos. On Tender Fury's two albums, Root excels 
with forceful economy. He showed that he could stretch out more prolifically on 
stage without becoming diffuse. 
</P>
<P>
The sound mix improved at the end, in time for Tender Fury to finish with two 
driving numbers, "Garden of Evil" and "(Desperate) And Looking for the Chip," 
that recalled the Cult in their headlong, insistent throb. Tender Fury 
headlined Friday at Bogart's in Long Beach.

EL TORITO'S CEO RESPONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I enjoyed your article, "Consistency Links Restaurant Chains" (by Max Jacobson, 
Calendar June 17). I appreciate your selection of El Torito as one of the five 
restaurants you visited. 
</P>
<P>
There are a couple of corrections I would like to bring to your attention, 
however, just for the record. 
</P>
<P>
The first El Torito opened in 1954 in Encino, and we were acquired by W.R. 
Grace in late 1976. In 1986, we again became a privately owned company. In 
addition, earlier this year we switched to cooking with 100% vegetable oil, 
which means no "heavily larded beans." 
</P>
<P>
I thought your assessment of the various chains was accurate and fairly done. 
However, your statement in the opening paragraph, (that) the "big companies are 
so successful that they couldn't care less," isn't true. I would like to assure 
you that we do care; providing our guests with the best in service, food and 
ambience has been our primary objective for 36 years.

REVIEW OF ERASURE CONCERT HARPED ON SEXUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading your review of the Erasure concert ("Capering Andy Bell Leads 
Erasure Through Zesty Evening" by Mike Boehm, Calendar June 18), I was pretty 
upset. For me and for three good friends of mine, this was our first concert, 
and we were very excited. Naturally, our hopes were high for this concert, and 
Erasure proved very quickly to be a very enthusiastic group. The four of us, as 
well as many others at the concert, knew of the two men's homosexuality. That 
had absolutely no effect whatsoever on our feelings toward the music or the 
band. 
</P>
<P>
Erasure's performance was nothing short of awesome. Maybe I feel this way 
because this was my first concert, but I'm almost positive that I really 
enjoyed the concert to the fullest. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most eye-catching lines in the article is this: "Bell didn't make a 
big point of his sexuality. . . ." I (also) didn't feel that Andy Bell made any 
special attempts to "exploit" his sexuality. In your article, however, there 
was one basic theme that you seemed to revolve around: Bell's sexuality! Your 
review didn't seem to be much of a review. It was more along the lines of gay 
performers and how much straight people love to see them perform. 
</P>
<P>
I think that most of the people there were able to overlook the sexuality of 
the two singers and enjoy the concert. It was neat. Nobody was making 
derogatory remarks that are usually heard when there are a couple of gay people 
around. I don't believe that I lowered my guard for the fun that they provided, 
and I'd like to believe that the other 10,000 there didn't either. 
</P>
<P>
You did Erasure an injustice by your constant harping on their homosexuality. 
If you went to a concert to later offer a review, please do that. Don't stoop 
to the level of bigotry that a lot of society has. Offer your readers an 
evaluation of the concert and Erasure's wonderful ability to give a stage 
performance that kids and adults will never forget. Please don't make such a 
big deal about their choice of life.

THROW A HOUSE PARTY GUESTS WON'T FORGET;

ENTERTAINMENT: ELEGANT BUT AFFORDABLE TOUCHES LIKE TRUMPETERS OR AN ENGLISH 
BUTLER CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE.

Kathy Miller knows how to throw a house party. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing we haven't done," says Miller, owner of Activities Inc., a 
party-planning service in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
At various fetes, she has set up human buffet tables with talking heads 
situated among the cheese and pate, planted a rude waiter or a couple staging a 
ferocious fight among the guests, and arranged a black-tie affair where guests 
ate with their hands (the client was tired of stuffy, sit-down dinners). 
</P>
<P>
"Any time you can create an atmosphere conducive to mingling, or get people 
talking, it helps break the ice," Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
While human buffet tables might not be your style, you can create an elegant 
ambience the next time you invite friends over by adding these classy but 
affordable touches: 
</P>
<P>
Imagine arriving at a party and having a trio of trumpet players herald your 
arrival. Most people expect such an honor to be reserved for royalty or 
presidents. Hosts who want to treat their party guests like bluebloods, 
however, can hire trumpeters from Fanfares d'Elegance of Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
The trumpeters will arrive in black tuxedos or Renaissance-style garb, then 
blow their horns as guests enter the party. 
</P>
<P>
"Guests like to feel regal. It brings out the goose bumps," says Owen 
Kirschner, director of Fanfares d'Elegance. 
</P>
<P>
His trumpeters have heralded the Duke and Duchess of York at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion and Pope John Paul II at a pre-Mass celebration in Los 
Angeles. They've played at grand-opening celebrations for South Coast Plaza's 
Crystal Court, the Atrium at Newport Beach's Fashion Island, and the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kirschner can provide up to 120 musicians, home entertainers can make 
do with one or two trumpeters for an elegant, but not ostentatious, display. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're having a party, you might have a single trumpeter welcome guests at 
the door and play when they go to dinner," Kirschner says. 
</P>
<P>
A Fanfares d'Elegance trumpeter costs $125 for two hours or less. For more 
information, call (213) 429-3732. 
</P>
<P>
Playing the harp doesn't sound like a hazardous job, but Rosalie Corson knows 
better. 
</P>
<P>
First, she has to haul around a harp that stands six feet tall and weighs about 
100 pounds -- no easy feat for the petite Corson, who's a foot shorter than her 
instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Then she often finds herself playing outdoors under trying conditions. 
Sometimes she struggles to keep the harp from blowing over in a strong wind, 
and she knows at least one harpist who landed in a pool, harp and all. 
</P>
<P>
"They have us playing on the edges of cliffs," Corson says. "We'd be happy just 
to play on a quiet, calm day sitting in the shade." 
</P>
<P>
No matter what the conditions, though, harpists always manage to sound as if 
they just dropped down from heaven, which is why hosts choose Corson to 
serenade their guests at private parties. 
</P>
<P>
"Harp music reminds people of angels," Corson says. "People tell me how 
soothing it is. It's not obtrusive." 
</P>
<P>
Harp music is especially suitable for small dinners and cocktail parties. 
Guests can carry on conversations while the harpist picks at the strings in the 
background. 
</P>
<P>
Corson, a Santa Ana resident, charges $150 for the first hour and $50 for each 
additional hour. She can be reached at (714) 544-3458. 
</P>
<P>
The host wanted to throw a beach bash on the Fourth of July, but he had a 
problem: He knew his guests would have to battle for parking spaces on the 
crowded streets of Laguna Beach. His solution added a touch of class to an 
otherwise casual affair. He hired the Majestic Valet Parking Service in Laguna 
Beach to park the guests' cars. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Mambeygi, owner of the valet parking service, says his valets have opened 
car doors for notables like Ronald Reagan and Eddie Murphy, but one need not be 
a VIP to be treated like one. 
</P>
<P>
Valets add a special touch for private, at-home get-togethers. Uniformed 
attendants will help guests out of their car, then whisk away the automobile so 
they can proceed immediately into the party. 
</P>
<P>
People want the parking service for two resons, Mambeygi says: necessity and 
class. Valets can solve parking shortages by maximizing the number of spaces 
while adding prestige to small home parties. 
</P>
<P>
Valet parking costs about $100 per attendant, with one attendant able to handle 
12 or 13 cars depending on the parking conditions. For information, call (714) 
497-1465. 
</P>
<P>
Party guests often don't know what to make of Christopher Allen. 
</P>
<P>
"You're a butler? And you're English?" they ask, staring at his crisp black 
tuxedo. Allen always answers politely in his proper English accent. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people don't know how to react to it. They don't expect to see a butler 
in a small house," Allen says. 
</P>
<P>
He portrays "the standard Hollywood image" of the British butler at private 
parties. He greets the guests, accepts their coats and any gifts they've 
brought, serves drinks, passes around hors d'oeuvres and announces dinner. 
During the meal, he's busy pouring the wine and announcing each course, 
describing every entree in detail. 
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise a guy who's allergic to salmon could be eating salmon mousse," Allen 
explains. 
</P>
<P>
After dinner, he serves coffee and cleans up. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy for the hostess -- she doesn't have to be bothered," he says. 
</P>
<P>
His presence gives the party an air of sophistication. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't have the same ambience if a caterer just dropped off food in 
cardboard boxes," he notes. 
</P>
<P>
Allen charges $25 an hour for the British butler service. He is available 
through the English Domestic Service Agency in Mission Viejo. For information, 
call (714) 859-1088. 
</P>
<P>
Folks can usually find Mark Daukas in the freezer. He was there again the other 
day at the walk-in freezer at Orange County Ice in Anaheim, wearing his work 
clothes -- a ski parka, ski pants, several layers of sweaters and kneepads -- 
as he carved his latest creation out of ice. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I'm dressed for the cold, it doesn't bother me," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Daukas is too concerned with making great sculptures out of ice to worry about 
the temperature. 
</P>
<P>
He has won every competition that counts in ice carving, including the 1989 
international ice carving competition in Japan, and he has helped elevate ice 
carving into an art form. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the standard buffet dolphin, he creates intricate sculptures of 
flamingos, swans, hearts, sea gulls, mermaids, dragons -- even a life-size 
Elvis. He makes a new sculpture every week for the Sunday brunch at the 
Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
"I aim to take my work out of the realm of a buffet piece and turn it into a 
sculpture medium," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Daukas can get fine detail in ice through his unorthodox carving methods. 
Instead of a chisel, he uses mostly power tools, including a dentist's drill, 
to make fine cuts. "A lot of people think we use blow torches," he says. 
</P>
<P>
The only drawback to Daukas' chilly profession: Sooner or later, all of his 
creations melt. 
</P>
<P>
The sculptures start at $300 and can go up to $18,000 for a massive 
show-stopper, such as a 25-foot-long scene of Santa and his flying reindeer. 
For more information, call Mark Daukas Designs at (714) 760-7271. 
</P>
<P>
"You're invited" -- how the host delivers those two little words often signals 
whether a party is going to be a smash or a sleeper. 
</P>
<P>
An inventive invitation suggests that the party, too, won't be your 
run-of-the-mill affair. 
</P>
<P>
Creative hosts who aren't satisfied with the printed invitations offered at 
stationery stores can invent their own at Classy Presents in Anaheim Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The staff will help the host devise a custom invitation for every kind of 
party. One can choose from all kinds of paper and card stock, 80 different type 
styles and 60 colors of ink. A favorite photograph or piece of art can be 
reproduced as well. 
</P>
<P>
The shop uses a computer to inscribe the invitations with calligraphy that 
looks like the work of a human hand, according to owner Judy Beard. 
</P>
<P>
Once, for a diamond anniversary, the shop laminated the invitations with silver 
sprinkles so they sparkled like diamonds, she says. 
</P>
<P>
The invitations cost $1 to $5 apiece, depending on the work and materials. 
Classy Presents also sells custom gift wrap, stationery and gifts. The shop is 
at 5773-A E. Santa Ana Canyon Road, Anaheim Hills. For information, call (714) 
921-9699.

HANDYMEN SHOULD STICK CLOSE TO THEIR GLUE GUNS 
</P>

Next time you tackle a construction job around the home, reach for your gun. 
I'm talking about your caulking gun. Load it up with one of a variety of 
specialized construction adhesives now available in caulking gun cartridges, 
and you'll have a potent tool for shooting down a wide variety of construction 
problems. Examples? 
</P>
<P>
Decking: The traditional way to fasten down deck planking is with two nails at 
every joist. This holds the planks down, at least initially, but with time, it 
also causes problems. One is splitting. Another is rust. Even the best 
hot-dipped galvanized nails will rust eventually. This causes stains and 
eventual deterioration of the decking. Nails can also work loose, pop up and 
injure bare feet. 
</P>
<P>
The answer to all these problems is deck adhesive, a special formula designed 
to work well with pressure-treated stock. Using this adhesive won't eliminate 
the need for nails entirely. You'll still need a few here and there (follow 
directions on the glue cartridge) to restrain warped boards and keep good 
contact between planking and joists. But you'll use far fewer nails than you 
would without adhesive, and you'll get a stronger, more durable job in the 
bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Sub-flooring: Here's another ideal application for construction adhesive. 
Typical floor construction calls for one layer of five-eighths or sometimes 
half-inch plywood followed by another layer of plywood under-layment to provide 
a smooth base for your finish flooring. By using adhesive and special 
three-quarter-inch tongue-and-groove plywood, you can do the job with just one 
layer. The adhesive should go on all joists, plus along the mating edges of the 
plywood sheets. Nail according to adhesive instructions and you'll get a 
sturdy, squeak-free floor with less labor than required for the old-fashioned 
two-layer system. 
</P>
<P>
Finishing off walls: There are also special adhesives for installing drywall 
and paneling. I always like to use at least a few fasteners when installing 
drywall, but with paneling, you may be able to get by without any nails at all, 
using this trick: 
</P>
<P>
Run a fat bead of adhesive on each stud and the panel in place, pressing it 
firmly into the adhesive. Immediately pull the panel away to let the adhesive 
dry for a short time (this varies according to brand). Then press the panel 
back in place. When you do, it will stick like, well . . . glue.

IT ONLY TAKES A TINY PIN AND A BIT OF WORK TO BURST WALLPAPER BUBBLE 
</P>

Q. My husband and I wallpapered our bathroom, and unfortunately a couple of 
bubbles have formed where the adhesive hasn't held. Is there a way to get rid 
of the bubble without putting a couple of big creases in the paper? 
</P>
<P>
D.G., 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
A. "If you've just finished the job, try poking a hole in it with a sharp pin 
and flattening it out," says Charlie Kaczorowski of Tustin Paint Mart. "If it's 
too dry, and the wall covering is paper, try wetting it then flattening it. If 
you're working with vinyl, you can try flattening it down and holding it till 
the paste sticks." 
</P>
<P>
Q. The rain gutters around our house need replacing, and we can't decide 
between aluminum or vinyl gutters. What are the pros and cons of each? 
</P>
<P>
J.K., 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
A. Besides aluminum and vinyl, you can also choose gutters made of steel, 
copper or even wood. Maintaining a good gutter system is important to keep 
water from falling in torrents around your home and possibly damaging the 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Aluminum makes a good choice, since it can be made to fit your home and have as 
few joints as possible, says Steve DiMiceli of T &amp; J Rain Gutters in Garden 
Grove. "You can have it pre-painted in about 20 colors, or you can have it done 
in primer gray and paint it yourself." 
</P>
<P>
For the price, aluminum probably has the best value. "Expect to pay around 
$2.25 per foot for aluminum gutters that will come with a 20-year guarantee." 
</P>
<P>
Galvanized steel and copper are two heavy-duty alternatives. Don Miller of 
Architectural Sheet Metal in Orange recommends these two for their durability, 
although the consumer should beware of a contractor taking shortcuts. "He may 
try to do it cheaply and caulk the seams, but steel and copper should always be 
soldered," says Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Prices for steel can start around $7 per foot, while copper can start from $18 
per foot and will depend on the metal's open market price. However, Miller 
points out that steel can last 50 years or more. And "copper can last the life 
of the building. Because of its resistance to rust, you may want it if your 
home is near the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
People who have trouble sleeping on rainy nights may prefer vinyl gutters for 
their silent operation. Vinyl's cost and ease of installation make it a popular 
do-it-yourself choice, according to Bob Burn of Santa Ana's Builder's Emporium. 
Expect vinyl guttering to run $5 per 10-foot section. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What's the best type of grass for a small area that doesn't get much sun? We 
have a corner at the side of the house where yard tools and garbage cans are 
kept. It won't take any type of sod that we've tried so far from the nursery. 
</P>
<P>
K.A., 
</P>
<P>
Seal Beach 
</P>
<P>
A. "If you haven't tried Bermuda grass, you may want to use that. It's probably 
the hardiest grass you can use for such an area," says Christina Versteeg of 
Huntington Garden Center in Huntington Beach. "If it should die out because of 
heavy use, it usually comes right back." 
</P>
<P>
Although Bermuda seed is available, you may want to try the sod if you'd like 
to have a consistent amount of coverage in that space. "Usually it costs around 
55 cents per square foot," says Versteeg. "If you're getting more than 500 
square feet, the price goes down."

GARDENING HAS INVIGORATING REWARDS FOR ELDERLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE VOLZ, MATURITY NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just because you are no longer in your salad days is no reason to give up 
gardening. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, insists 65-year-old Florence Everts, a Washington landscape designer 
who has designed gardens around the world, gardening is "probably the most 
therapeutic, rejuvenating and invigorating" activity senior citizens can engage 
in. 
</P>
<P>
Everts, a transplanted Australian and the wife of a retired U.S. foreign 
service officer, has designed gardens at American embassies in Pakistan and 
China. She now landscapes in Washington, where she is a partner in the firm 
Donnelly, Everts &amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
She is quick to offer gardening tips, especially for seniors. For example, she 
notes that although bending over can be good exercise, some senior backs 
stiffen quite quickly. One suggestion: Use raised flower beds. You won't have 
to bend over quite so far. 
</P>
<P>
And there is no rule in gardening that prevents you from bringing along a stool 
to sit on. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Smith &amp; Hawken, a Mill Valley company, offers a variety of tools 
for seniors. They include two-foot-long forks or trowels, which weigh only a 
pound each and cost $12.50 apiece, or a $39 gardening stool to either sit or 
kneel on. (A canvas cover is an extra $14. For a catalogue, write: 25 Corte 
Madera Ave., Mill Valley, Calif. 94941.) 
</P>
<P>
Although gardening is a solitary endeavor, it's a great way to meet people and 
close the generation gap, Everts contends. 
</P>
<P>
She recommends that avid gardeners consider joining plant societies. Almost 
every large city has clubs devoted especially to one type of flower, such as 
the camellia, for example. 
</P>
<P>
"You can meet experts, but it is also an opportunity to meet others," Everts 
says. "There is a great mix of generations. You get horticulture students and 
people who are just interested in gardens." 
</P>
<P>
Everts says that the societies and garden clubs often run tours to private or 
public gardens; that is not only a good way to socialize, but it's also 
"healthy because there is a lot of walking." 
</P>
<P>
Another endeavor for the senior gardener is volunteer service for cities that 
need assistance in keeping their parks in good condition. Everts suggested 
contacting local officials to find out how you can help. 
</P>
<P>
One of Everts' own "local" tasks was to design the gardens of the ambassador's 
residence in Islamabad, Pakistan. She directed a crowd of gardeners, laborers 
and children in hauling in 80,000 cubic feet of soil. Her army of helpers 
planted 1,000 flowering shrubs, 150 shade trees and 70 flowering trees. 
</P>
<P>
So, if you are complaining about planting a pear tree, think of Everts and dig 
in. 
</P>
<P>
Horticultural experts offer these tips for older gardeners: 
</P>
<P>
Plant perennial flowers. Since they come up annually, you cut down on the need 
to dig and plant each year. 
</P>
<P>
Vegetables aren't so easy because there aren't that many perennials. Asparagus 
is one of the few. Putting in vegetable plants, rather than sowing seed and 
having to thin out the tiny shoots, can save some bending. A number of 
vegetables can be purchased as plants, including lettuce, tomatoes, cabbage and 
peppers. 
</P>
<P>
Use a thick mulch to keep the weeds down and the moisture in. This means less 
weeding. 
</P>
<P>
For expansive lawns, use ground cover such as ivy, which takes much less

NEW PHOTO MUSEUM DIRECTOR IS KEEPING HIS PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
PHOTOGRAPHY: HEAD OF RIVERSIDE INSTITUTION IS BUILDING A LOCAL CONSTITUENCY . . 
. AND WANTS TO APPEAL TO ANGELENOS, TOO.

When he first heard that UC Riverside's California Museum of Photography needed 
a director, Jonathan W. Green said to himself, "Oh, great. L.A." 
</P>
<P>
What did he know? From his vantage point in Columbus, Ohio, Riverside and Los 
Angeles sounded like the same big, sprawling city. 
</P>
<P>
Checking into the situation, Green discovered that Riverside is 1 1/2 to 3 
hours from Los Angeles -- depending upon traffic -- and that the psychological 
distance looms even longer in some Angelenos' heads. He heard of Westsiders who 
refuse to drive to downtown Los Angeles, much less to Riverside's 
well-populated hinterland. 
</P>
<P>
Enlightened but undaunted, Green resigned as director of exhibitions at the 
Wexner Center for the Visual Arts at Ohio State University and headed west. The 
50-year-old photographer, author, historian and critic is now director of the 
California Museum of Photography in downtown Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
The museum -- which boasts a collection of 18,000 photographs by recognized 
masters, 100,000 images documenting a century of world history, 250,000 
stereoscopic prints and negatives, and 6,000 cameras and related pieces of 
equipment -- was established in 1973 at UC Riverside. The museum was lodged in 
an old house on campus until last April, when it moved to a cleverly 
refurbished Kress variety store on the downtown pedestrian mall. With a new 
public face and a more accessible location -- however distant from Los Angeles 
-- the museum is poised to play a stronger role in Southern California's art 
scene and to raise its national and international profile. 
</P>
<P>
"The museum is well known in the photography community," Green said, 
acknowledging that he has something of a sleeper on his hands. "(Former 
director) Charles Desmarais and the museum's small staff have accomplished a 
small miracle by getting the museum built and running a strong program with 
limited resources," he said, but now it's time to expand the program and 
increase the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Challenge No. 1, as Green sees it, is "to understand the relationship between 
Riverside and Los Angeles, and how to bridge that gap." That dilemma is part of 
what he calls "the dual challenge of building a constituency in Riverside 
County and doing the kind of shows that will make people in Los Angeles think 
that it's worth the drive to come out here." 
</P>
<P>
The museum's potential is enormous, but the task of realizing that potential is 
extremely complex. To be successful, the California Museum of Photography must 
not only become part of greater Los Angeles' art community, it must also serve 
the university's needs as well as those of Riverside's lay audience. 
</P>
<P>
"The key point that made the job interesting to me was that the university had 
the vision to build the museum in the middle of the community," Green said. 
"There's an exciting potential in reaching both ways. The university has 
intellectual and academic responsibilities, but it also provides leverage and 
resources to mesh with the community. My problem is how to get the most 
interesting work to the largest audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming from the Midwest, I'm concerned about how to make the collection 
relevant and accessible to the Hispanic population here. The population is 40% 
Chicano in this area. We want to play a role in the Riverside area, so we will 
institute bilingual programs and undoubtedly add staff members from minority 
groups," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many demands facing the museum can be met by sensitive and creative 
programming, Green said. "I hope to concentrate on three words in the title, 
California Museum of Photography. We should try to identify as clearly as 
possible what it means to be a museum in the late 20th Century in the arena of 
photography, and to address regional issues in California," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Green envisions a three-part program: "At all times I expect to have a 
historical show that reevaluates material in the collection in terms of current 
thought and critical theories. There will also be a contemporary show that will 
include work by local artists and artists from other parts of California. The 
third exhibition, running simultaneously, will expand the traditional notion of 
photography to include film, video, performance and mixed-media work that 
incorporates photography." 
</P>
<P>
This third category is a new direction, and it will bring work into the museum 
that does not look like photography. This move is likely to meet resistance 
from the museum's traditional audience, but there is no reason to separate 
contemporary photography from the rest of art now that it has become so 
thoroughly assimilated, Green noted. 
</P>
<P>
Photography still occupies a special place in the art world, however. "One of 
the reasons that photography is pro-active in recent political and social 
issues is that it continually focuses back on the real world. Photographers 
tend not to hide in ivory towers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Green, who has been a review panelist and consultant for the National Endowment 
for the Arts, said he expects the museum to "make a concerted response to the 
censorship issue." 
</P>
<P>
A free-lance photographer and author of five books on photography, Green has 
arrived in California after a 22-year career in the Northeast and Midwest. He 
joined the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1968, 
teaching photography and directing the institute's Creative Photography 
Laboratory and Gallery. In 1976, he moved to Ohio State University, where he 
spearheaded the widely acclaimed Wexner Center for the Visual Arts, a 
$43-million museum and multidisciplinary art center that opened last year.

BARRY WHITE'S SOUND HAS MADE A COMEBACK, BUT CAN HE?;

Barry White had several nicknames in the '70s, when his sultry songs were among 
the most popular in the era of disco. 
</P>
<P>
He was known as Dr. Love and the Prince of Pillow Talk -- and he smiles now at 
the mention of them. 
</P>
<P>
In a playful mood during an interview at the Hollywood offices of A&amp;M 
Records, White said, "Women love to hear me say things like, 'I love ya, baby.' 
I was able to touch women at their very core. In the '70s, they loved me." 
</P>
<P>
But there's another nickname from the '70s that he dismisses: King of Disco. 
</P>
<P>
"That's foolish," White said, speaking with the intensity and authority of a 
preacher in the pulpit. "Disco had been around since 1969. I surfaced in 1972. 
I was just there at the right time with the kind of music that was happening." 
</P>
<P>
Another reason that White, 45, may not like the disco tag is that it has been a 
stigma in an '80s pop world that viewed the peppy dance music of the '70s as 
horribly passe. 
</P>
<P>
But dance music is back in vogue, and some of pop's most acclaimed new stars 
are pointing to White as a major influence. Among them, British soul singer 
Lisa Stansfield, whose "All Around the World" is one of the biggest-selling 
singles of the year. 
</P>
<P>
An outgoing man who speaks effusively about music, White loves Stansfield's 
record and takes pride in what he sees as elements of his style in the hit. 
</P>
<P>
"She used my formula for phrasing, my chord progressions, my melody structure, 
my style of doubling of the harmony," he said, with no sense of jealousy or 
resentment. "I appreciate that. She's one of the students in the Barry White 
school of music." 
</P>
<P>
White also, justifiably, sees elements of his silky, sexy approach in the music 
of such other newcomers as England's Soul II Soul as well as veterans like 
Luther Vandross and Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Now White hopes that the public will respond to his own new album the way it 
has to the records by Stansfield and the others. 
</P>
<P>
White had 10 Top 40 hits in the '70s, including "I'm Gonna Love You Just a 
Little More Baby" and "Never, Never Gonna Give You Up." But when disco went 
under at the end of the decade, White's popularity sank with it. It's taken 
most of this decade for White, who's appearing with his 32-piece orchestra at 
the Universal Amphitheatre on Sunday, to reestablish himself. 
</P>
<P>
His singing on "The Secret Garden," the hit single from Quincy Jones' latest 
album, probably did more than anything else to reintroduce White to American 
fans. His own A&amp;M albums have also helped. The first, 1987's "The Right 
Night," didn't catch on, but "The Man is Back" has been a steady seller in the 
soul market since last fall. 
</P>
<P>
At times White spoke so fervently about pioneering the use of strings as a 
primary instrument in disco that he seemed to be bragging. 
</P>
<P>
Sensing this, White paused. "I'm really a modest man," he said. "I'm not 
bragging. Barry White doesn't brag. But sometimes you have to speak up for 
yourself, to let people know what you've done. People forget. I know a lot of 
them forgot about me." 
</P>
<P>
White didn't dwell on the '80s, mostly a down decade for him. The problem, he 
claimed, was that after more than 10 years of writing, producing and arranging 
music -- for himself, the vocal group Love Unlimited and the Love Unlimited 
Orchestra -- he simply needed a break. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just tired," he said. "So, I took a rest so I could come back 
rejuvenated." 
</P>
<P>
White grew up in Watts, a high-school dropout more interested in gang 
activities than music. But after spending seven months in jail in 1960 for a 
gang-related incident he declined to explain, White was through with that life. 
He turned to music, where he was no overnight success. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on the streets for 11 1/2 years before I got a hit record," recalled the 
singer, who worked as a session pianist and arranger in the '60s. "I was 
struggling and hustling and getting nowhere. I had four kids by the time I was 
21. We survived on welfare for five years. Sometimes I thought those rough days 
would never end. But I kept pushing and pushing." 
</P>
<P>
In the early '70s, White discovered a marketable formula. "My music deals with 
the relationship between two people," he said. "I've always written music that 
people can play during romantic moments. One thing I do is speak sensitively to 
women. Most men don't do that. They don't think it's manly to express 
themselves in a tender manner to women." 
</P>
<P>
These days White has comfortably married his signature style with frantic 
hip-hop rhythms. The difference between now and then White noted, is mostly 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
"They have machines for this sound and machines for that sound, but one thing 
remains the same," he said. "The song is the most important thing. That hasn't 
changed. As long as I can still write a song, there'll be a place for me in 
music."
