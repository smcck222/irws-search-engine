<P>
With The World According to Garp (Channel 13 Sunday at 8 p.m.), writer Steve 
Tesich and director George Roy Hill try to hew to the heart of the sprawling, 
surreal John Irving novel, cherishing the fragility of life and illuminating 
the complicated existence of novelist T.S. Garp (a sweetly randy Robin 
Williams). However, the only person who seems more than a literary conceit is 
John Lithgow's dignified, poignant and funny transsexual who once played tight 
end for the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
Although embellished by gorgeous location filming, the 1988 TV movie The Woman 
He Loved (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.), in which Jane Seymour and Anthony Andrews play 
the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, is at best plodding and far inferior to the 
1981 "Masterpiece Theatre" version of the Windsor legend. 
</P>
<P>
The crux of the fairly absorbing 1988 TV movie A Stoning in Fulham County (NBC 
Sunday at 9 p.m.) is that an Amish farmer (Ron Perlman) won't testify against 
some assailants, even though his infant daughter is killed. 
</P>
<P>
In Poor Little Rich Girl: The Barbara Hutton Story (NBC Monday at 9 p.m., 
completed Tuesday at 8 p.m.) Farrah Fawcett manages to bring some dimension to 
the unhappy heiress whose life seems to have been as hollow as this film. 
</P>
<P>
Murder by Natural Causes (Channel 11 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a terrific 1979 
made-for-TV thriller, written and produced by Richard Levinson and William 
Link, with Hal Holbrook and Katharine Ross starring. 
</P>
<P>
Murder: By Reason of Insanity (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is a solid, 
fact-based 1985 TV movie, directed by Anthony Page and starring Candice Bergen 
as a wife battered by a mental-patient husband (Jurgen Prochnow, who is 
chilling). 
</P>
<P>
The Woman in Red (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is a sexy but crass 1984 
remake of Yves Robert's infidelity farce, "Pardon Mon Affaire," and boasts a 
stunning temptress in Kelly Le Brock and a sterling main-title balladeer in 
Stevie Wonder. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1987 Dolls (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.), Stuart Gordon, whose first two 
films were imaginative and bloody H.P. Lovecraft adaptations, is more whimsical 
and lighthearted in this knowing trapped-in-a-dark-mansion-in-a-hideous 
rainstorm genre piece featuring menacing children's playthings. 
</P>
<P>
Vincente Minnelli's 1952 The Bad and the Beautiful (Channel 5 Saturday at 8 
p.m.) remains one of Hollywood's best commentaries on itself and is as 
memorable for its David Raksin score as it is for its stellar cast, headed by 
Kirk Douglas and Lana Turner. The KTLA telecast will be colorized. 
</P>
<P>
The evergreen Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid with Newman and Redford 
returns Saturday on Channel 9 at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
As in "Psycho," Curtis Hanson's 1987 The Bedroom Window (Channel 13 Saturday at 
8 p.m.), a Hitchcockian pastiche about successively deeper layers of voyeurism, 
terror and guilt, takes us from adultery and deceit to murder and madness. It 
doesn't quite jell, but it's engrossing and has a fine cast headed by Steve 
Guttenberg, Isabelle Huppert and Elizabeth McGovern. 
</P>
<P>
The 1975 Cousin, Cousine (Channel 28 Saturday at 9 p.m.) remains one of the 
most popular foreign films, a pleasant romantic fantasy in which cousins by 
marriage embark upon an affair without much thought for their spouses, who are 
unsympathetic anyway. With Marie-Christine Barrault, Victor Lanoux.

It is my impression that movies, TV and stage shows were to be entertainment, 
which the dictionary defines as diverting and amusing. What puzzles me is when 
I hear producers say a program wasn't realistic enough. 
</P>
<P>
Since when is realism diverting and amusing? Could it be that these people 
aren't realistic enough to know the difference? 
</P>
<P>
My interpretation of entertainment is "The Wizard of Oz," "Superman," "Back to 
the Future," "Batman," "Star Trek," Sherlock Holmes, Robin Hood, Tarzan, Disney 
classics and so on. All quite unrealistic, but everlasting! 
</P>
<P>
I think the most realistic thing to do is keep bedrooms for sleeping, violence 
for the news broadcasts and return to real entertainment that is both diverting 
and amusing.

<P>
Que Viva Mexico! (Bravo Monday at 11 p.m.): This is a fascinating assemblage of 
Sergei Eisenstein's aborted 1932 poetic epic of Mexican peasantry. (1:30) 
</P>
<P>
The Best Years of Our Lives (TNT Thursday at 5 p.m.): The key to this enduring 
William Wyler-Samuel Goldwyn postwar classic is that it touches upon timeless 
themes of homecoming and family relationships and that its three very different 
returning soldiers -- Fredric March, Harold Russell and Dana Andrews -- allow 
for wide identification. (3:45) 
</P>
<P>
Danton (A&amp;E early Sunday at 1 a.m.): Bleakly beautiful and richly detailed, 
Andrzej Wajda's 1982 film is an electrifying depiction of a society hurtling 
toward chaos. Gerard Depardieu is superb in the title role as the boisterous 
and earthy revolutionary. (3:00)

OK, you finally got me to write. After 30 years of subscribing to The Times, I 
finally protest and am sending back to you the "Tales of the Crypt" cover of 
our TV guide for the week of June 3. 
</P>
<P>
The cover was disgusting and not a sight I wanted to see every time I picked up 
the guide. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, please be more aware of how this affects small children (my 
grandchildren, to be specific) and at least not be as graphic. 
</P>
<P>
I still love The Times and will forgive this one mistake, but I just felt you 
should know how one subscriber felt about this sort of cover.

AN INCONCEIVABLE RELATIONSHIP? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your June 28 article (" 'Mother of Us All' Is Pushed From Pedestal") on the new 
biography of Simone de Beauvoir by Deirdre Blair, and Blair's reconstruction of 
the writer's life, merits the following comment: 
</P>
<P>
How Simone de Beauvoir lived her sex life doesn't really merit a book to be 
written about the subject. 
</P>
<P>
As to her relationship with Jean Paul Sartre, both seemed to have found it 
convenient. She was known and will be remembered as la femme de Sartre. Their 
relationship transcended from the sexual to the fraternal, a sexless friendship 
between man and woman that American women writers, above all, cannot conceive.

LEGALIZING STREET VENDORS: MOVE TO AVOID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iwould like to comment on "Vendors vs. the Law" (June 27). 
</P>
<P>
I was born and raised in Venezuela where street vendors, although illegal, are 
as thick as flies and just as annoying. 
</P>
<P>
In business districts, they take up most of the sidewalk, creating hazards for 
the pedestrians and large amounts of trash that wind up on the street. The 
vendors are unfair competition for merchants since they do not have to pay rent 
or taxes and have no upkeep. Peeled fruit and most foods tend to develop nasty 
bacteria that can make unsuspecting customers extremely ill. 
</P>
<P>
If vending were legalized as LAPD Chief Daryl Gates longs for, we would have 
uncontrolled vendors all over the city and another incompetent government 
agency that will be overworked and understaffed. Councilman Michael Woo should 
take a little trip down to Latin America and experience vendors personally 
before creating another government monster. Believe me, they are not something 
we would like to add to our way of life in this city.

ZAN THOMPSON: AT LEAST GIVE HER CREDIT FOR TRYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ZAN THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is nothing like standing by a cash register with your prospective 
purchases and learning that your credit is not good -- unless it is spending 
two hours unsnarling the skein of mishaps. 
</P>
<P>
I went to a department store in the Santa Anita Fashion Mall to find something 
crisp and cool to wear in La Quinta. This is the time of year when everything 
in the closet looks scratchy and feels like something a monk into 
self-mortification might slip on. 
</P>
<P>
I found a place to park after just three circuits of the parking area and went 
in the store. The petite section is on the second floor. Petite is a size 
classification for people who are short. Clothing manufacturers have finally 
almost adjusted to the existence of women over 21 years of age being short. 
(Petites are often full of bows and ruffles and sparklies. They look as if they 
were designed for women who squeal and say "Oooh!" a lot.) 
</P>
<P>
I wandered through the racks of clothes looking for the perfect garment to make 
me look tall and willowy. 
</P>
<P>
After a few minutes, a smiling young woman came up and asked if she could help 
me. I told her I was looking for tops and pants to wear on a trip where it 
would be warm in the daytime and cool in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
My friends all seem to have handsome sweaters in beautiful colors made of 
cloud-puff yarn. I have a couple that look as if they should be given to the 
dog to use as a blanket; those two and an Aran Islands sweater I bought in 
Ireland that is too warm unless a Texas norther is coming through. 
</P>
<P>
Pleasant and helpful salesperson Kathleen Brooker helped me gather some things, 
which she folded and placed on the counter in one of the cash register islands. 
</P>
<P>
First, we had to call the assistant manager of the section because I had 
selected a sweater that seemed to be an orphan and had a code that made the 
computer cross. The assistant manager punched in some numbers that placated the 
machine and we pushed forward. 
</P>
<P>
When it was all punched in, Kathleen looked at me, sadly. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the matter?" I quavered. 
</P>
<P>
"It says, 'Customer to credit.' You have to go upstairs," she told me. 
</P>
<P>
I did and stood in line where a number of women were trying to have their bills 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
When it was my turn, the young woman in charge of the cash counter brought my 
name up from the same computer somewhere and said to me pleasantly, "You 
haven't paid your Christmas bill." 
</P>
<P>
I was wrathfully righteous and the woman in charge of the credit desk said I 
could speak to someone in the credit office at the downtown store. His name was 
Don, and when I told him I lived in La Quinta he told me about his wife's 
parents' place next door in Indian Wells. 
</P>
<P>
Don read me the charges on my account from last December. I had bought every 
item. The gifts of December sound dreary in the heat of July. But I did 
remember each thing and to whom it went. 
</P>
<P>
I explained that I had never been billed for any of these things, and although 
I am the soul of rectitude, I am unlikely to send a department store a check in 
an undetermined amount at any time, and especially if I have never been asked. 
</P>
<P>
The money desk woman said that my bills had been sent to a man named Thompson 
in a city in Arizona where I have never set foot. I told Phyllis Chaucoin at 
the money desk that my name was Mrs. Douglas K. Thompson and the account had 
been active for some years. The computer had been billing the man in Arizona, 
whose name differed somewhat, for seven months. 
</P>
<P>
Don in downtown credit said he would fix everything in the computer and all 
would be well after I wrote a check in the amount I owed. I did, and gave the 
check to Phyllis and went back to find Kathleen after one hour and 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Several people worked on ringing up my purchases for the second time and you 
know what happened. The thing said, "Customer to credit." 
</P>
<P>
I went back upstairs and saw Phyllis, who was sympathetic. By that time, I had 
a dull disinterest in everything I had bought. 
</P>
<P>
I went back to Kathleen who was pleasant and apologetic. Later, I tried to tell 
the head of personnel how nice Kathleen had been but that department answers, 
"Human Resources." I was so demoralized I hung up before I could commend 
Kathleen, Phyllis and Don. I thought that by some electronic mishap, I had 
reached Washington and the Department of Human Resources. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, I wrote a change of address notice to all of my charge accounts when I 
moved and that was the first time I had tried to use that account since I 
bought the Christmas stuff. 
</P>
<P>
I phoned and tried once more to tell someone, anyone, that some nice people had 
tried to help me but when I asked for Petites, they gave me Better Dresses and 
turned on the aural molasses, causing me to hang up, a demoralized broken 
blossom. 
</P>
<P>
I think it would have been in the spirit of the season for the fellow in 
Arizona to pay that little old bill.

ROGER SIMON: WHY TELL THE TRUTH WHEN LIES WILL DO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oh, come on. You didn't really believe him, did you? 
</P>
<P>
You really believed George Bush when he said: "Read my lips: No new taxes"? 
</P>
<P>
Naw, you couldn't have. Not unless your IQ is somewhere around room 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of Americans know that candidates for President lie to us. We 
demand it, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
I'll give you an example: In 1984, Walter Mondale told the truth and said that 
if he was elected President, he would raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
And everybody including the press jumped down his throat, saying he was a 
dummy, a dope and a dweeb for speaking the truth. 
</P>
<P>
So it was not difficult for George Bush's brain trust to come up with their 
game plan for 1988: 
</P>
<P>
First Genius: "Lemme see, if Mondale loses by saying he will raise taxes then 
we should . . . we should . . . we should . . . 
</P>
<P>
Second Genius: "We should say we won't raise taxes!" 
</P>
<P>
First Genius: "That's it! That's it! But is it true?" 
</P>
<P>
Second Genius: "Gee, this is politics. I don't think that matters." 
</P>
<P>
It sure doesn't matter to the public. We will take the candidate of soothing 
lies over the candidate of hard truths any day. 
</P>
<P>
It worked for Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Ronald Reagan said he would give America guns and butter and balance 
the budget -- all at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, he was elected, and he never came close to balancing the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
But did we blame the guy? Naw. We knew he had been pulling our legs, but, gee, 
it sure felt good while he was doing it. 
</P>
<P>
True, some real conservatives were angry with Ronald Reagan for not balancing 
the budget. But when it came time for Reagan's re-election, what were these 
angry conservatives going to do? Vote for Walter Mondale in protest? 
</P>
<P>
No way. Maybe these voters felt betrayed by Reagan, but they sure were not 
about to vote for some crazed liberal instead. 
</P>
<P>
And I predict the same may be true for Bush. He will probably suffer no great 
political damage for having fibbed to us. Sure, the Democrats will run around 
saying, "He lied! He lied!" 
</P>
<P>
But in 1992, I think lots of people who voted for Bush and are angry about 
increased taxes will end up saying: "What am I supposed to do? Vote for a 
Democrat? Won't he raise taxes even more?" 
</P>
<P>
That's what the Republicans always tell us, anyway: "Maybe we didn't do 
everything we said we would, but you've got to stick with us because the 
Democrats will do a lot worse." 
</P>
<P>
And it sells. It sold for Reagan, and it may sell for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Which still leaves Bush with a momentary embarrassment. How does a President 
explain that he spoke an untruth? 
</P>
<P>
Well, that's what presidential spokesmen are for. While often fine fellows 
personally, professionally they are human fog machines. Here is the explanation 
from Marlin Fitzwater, the presidential spokesman, as to how Bush could say one 
thing about taxes back in 1988 and the opposite in 1990: 
</P>
<P>
"We feel he said the right thing then and he's saying the right thing now. . . 
. Everything we said was true then, and it's true now." 
</P>
<P>
Got that? George Orwell may have invented "doublespeak," but George Bush 
perfected it. 
</P>
<P>
But what made Bush change his mind about taxes? Why didn't he just keep going 
along blowing smoke up our skirts? 
</P>
<P>
It's something called the "burden of office." And it's no joke. If you are a 
fundamentally decent man, which I believe Bush to be, you wake up one morning 
and you tell yourself: "Hey, I've got to really do something about the deficit 
in this country, or we may have some real trouble here." 
</P>
<P>
Deficit is a word that doesn't really mean anything to most of us because the 
numbers are too huge. But you want a way of understanding what the real problem 
is? Take a look at Donald Trump's monthly expenses. 
</P>
<P>
They were just revealed because he is in so much hot water that his banks are 
putting him on a budget. Look where his money goes, however: Every month he 
pays $583,000 in "personal expenses." OK, so the guy's a big tipper. Aside from 
that, he pays $246,000 for his Boeing 727 jet, $841,000 for his yacht, and $2.1 
million interest on his loans. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, his monthly interest payments are way beyond what he spends on 
his toys. And that's what the deficit is doing to our government. 
</P>
<P>
The interest on the federal deficit is huge. It is now more than $175 billion a 
year. And that money does not go to build roads or feed the hungry or even put 
a human on Mars. It goes to pay off the financiers, many of whom are German and 
Japanese, who bought the government bonds in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
The problem has gotten so out of hand that even George Bush is now convinced we 
must reduce the deficit. And cutting spending is not enough. We must also raise 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
True, he said he wouldn't do that. He lied. If we could tax lying, we could 
probably wipe out the deficit, but we'd never get Congress to pass that law. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, however, if you want to know a sure-fire method of telling when 
a politician is lying, try this: 
</P>
<P>
Watch his lips. 
</P>
<P>
If they're moving, he's lying.

A VISION OF LUXURY HOMES FOR OLD DUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERKLEY HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WEST COVINA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jake Amar, environmental systems manager for the BKK Corp. landfill, guided his 
white van along a dirt road that winds around the base of two mountains of 
trash. 
</P>
<P>
One day, Amar said, the terraced pyramids amid the San Jose Hills will be 
transformed. Instead of dirt-covered garbage, grassy knolls will form the 
center of two proposed multimillion-dollar developments in West Covina and 
Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
The BKK plan calls for luxury homes, office buildings, industrial facilities, 
equestrian trails, a low-rise hotel and a championship golf course to ring a 
1,200-acre landscape whose garbage and toxic-waste foundations will be hidden. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's very, very safe," Amar said of the dump's proximity to the two 
separate but related developments, one in southern West Covina, the other in 
western Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
As Amar spoke, front-end loaders buried trash tumbling from garbage trucks at 
the 583-acre landfill, the county's second largest, which is scheduled to close 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
"The logical thing to do," BKK Corp. President Kenneth Kazarian said, "(is) to 
develop the land." 
</P>
<P>
Although a number of closed landfills in the nation have been made into 
facilities such as golf courses, Kazarian described his company's efforts to 
reclaim land around a toxic dump as pioneering, in part because of the 
expensive precautions being undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
But, reflective of the dump's controversial role for three decades, not 
everyone agrees that the latest proposals are either logical or innovative. And 
if recent public meetings are an indication, the debate will probably continue 
for months and years as officials rule on the plans. 
</P>
<P>
Besides local agencies, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the state 
Department of Health Services, the South Coast Air Quality Management District 
and the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board will review aspects of 
the development plans as they relate to the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
"That site has a real serious potential to pollute longer than my lifetime and 
your lifetime," said George Tracy, head of West Covina's Waste Management and 
Environmental Quality Commission. 
</P>
<P>
During the early 1980s, 103 acres of the landfill served as the only 
toxic-waste dump between Santa Barbara and the Mexican border. Some 3.4 million 
tons of such waste -- everything from batches of bad vodka to cyanide -- was 
dumped. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, not long after gases seeped into nearby houses and forced 21 families 
to evacuate, the hazardous-waste section of the landfill was closed in the wake 
of public and governmental pressure. A month before, the EPA had rated the site 
as one of the nation's most dangerous toxic dumps, filled with a spongy soup of 
cancer-causing chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
In light of this, Tracy's city commission has repeatedly urged the City Council 
to act with caution on the development proposal for West Covina that has been 
devised by Newport Beach-based Davis Developments, which is working with BKK. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the City Council last Monday gave its unanimous consent to include 
the BKK land as part of a West Covina redevelopment plan. A 2.3 
million-square-foot commercial development is proposed for BKK land northwest 
of where trash is dumped. In an earlier step last month, the council approved 
an environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a tremendous project," West Covina Mayor William Tarozzi 
said. He added that he supports the development because various experts have 
assured him of its safety. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Sorsher, an associate waste management engineer with the state Department 
of Health Services, said a thick earthen cover has been installed over the 
dump's toxic section. Readings from air, soil and water monitoring devices do 
not indicate immediate public health hazards, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite such assurances, Walnut officials and residents have responded with 
less enthusiasm to the BKK-backed proposal for the untouched hills and ravines 
there. 
</P>
<P>
Maurice Cofer, past president of the Gartel Fuerte Homeowners Assn., complains 
about "the raping of the hills." His view is shared, he said, by seven 
homeowners groups whose opposition is based on environmental and growth 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
A BKK subsidiary, Walnut Land Co., in partnership with Newport Beach-based 
William Lyon Co., has proposed a luxury housing tract, a low-rise hotel, a golf 
course and a 9.5-acre commercial center. This would be designed, BKK officials 
say, to connect with the West Covina development, although there would be much 
open space between them. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for nearly a half-mile buffer zone separating housing from the 
landfill itself. The houses would be 2,000 to 3,000 square feet in size and 
sell for upward of $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
Walnut Mayor Bertha (Bert) Ashley said the City Council will not approve the 
plans unless they are drastically scaled down. She said developers want 
permission to build 695 houses on 551 acres, a ratio that far exceeds the 
zoning allowed in the hilly area. 
</P>
<P>
Kazarian said those who criticize BKK and its development plans fail to 
appreciate his company's willingness to compromise. 
</P>
<P>
He said BKK agreed to close the non-hazardous section of the landfill 10 years 
earlier than planned, at a loss of millions of dollars. If the land goes 
undeveloped, he said, Walnut and West Covina would lose money too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just our company with vision," Kazarian said, citing West Covina 
officials' support for BKK's plans. 
</P>
<P>
Money is a key to that support, the officials say. BKK is West Covina's largest 
generator of business tax revenue, accounting for $3 million of the $44 million 
in total city revenues projected for the coming year. City officials say they 
are worried about how they will replace the dump when it closes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to take something that could have been just a vacant piece of 
ground . . . and make it into an economically viable piece of land," said 
Michael Miller, West Covina's community services director. 
</P>
<P>
An office and light industrial development, Miller said, could provide jobs and 
supplement the loss of BKK revenue. 
</P>
<P>
But West Covina resident Jean Arneson, a leading foe of BKK, said the emphasis 
on dollars represents misplaced priorities. "I'm worried that our council is 
concentrating on the money to be made from redeveloping BKK land and is not 
concerned about the environment," she said. "I'd like to see it all left as an 
open, green space." 
</P>
<P>
More than anything else, Arneson said, she is worried about what is buried at 
the dump. "We're leaving a legacy of a trash-making generation," she said. 
"What a legacy for the city that labels itself as the 'City of Beautiful 
Homes.' " 
</P>
<P>
This sentiment was expressed often in the early 1980s, when hundreds of 
residents jammed the council chambers to decry "Waste Covina." Four council 
members, accused of granting accommodations to BKK, had to fight off a recall 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
Since those days, officials of Torrance-based BKK say they have spent $38 
million in sophisticated improvements at the dump. "We haven't been a popular 
neighbor," Kazarian said, "but we've done our best to not be a bad neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the company's harshest critics agree that the situation is vastly 
improved. "Things once were very bad with BKK. Things are now better," said 
longtime BKK critic Nancy E. Adin, who lives less than a quarter-mile from the 
landfill's toxic portion. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Adin shared a $43-million out-of-court settlement with more than 500 
other neighbors of the dump. The neighbors, who each received between $25,000 
and $300,000, had sued the company, its insurance companies and the developers 
of subdivisions near the dump over alleged health and safety problems related 
to the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
Adin, a chemistry teacher at Cal State Los Angeles and Cal State Fullerton, 
says she is taking a cautious approach toward the development proposals. "It 
could be a tremendous disaster or it could be nothing," she said.

OH MY! 25 YEARS OF LIONS, TIGERS AND BEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
As any entertainer knows, the trick is to grab the audience before the first 
commercial break. 
</P>
<P>
The formula has always worked well for Jeanne Collier, a 25-year veteran docent 
at the Greater Los Angeles Zoo who was honored last month for completing her 
12,000th volunteer hour. 
</P>
<P>
Collier coordinates the zoo's speaker's bureau from her Eagle Rock home. But 
for her, the fun begins when she laces up her tennis shoes, straightens her 
safari shirt, and prepares to shepherd a group of kids on a tour of the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying an oddity-crammed handbag of fake fur ("Real people wear fake fur," 
she said jauntily), Collier is a blend of storyteller, jester, teacher and mom 
to the thousands of people she has guided past the preening flamingos and 
around the omnipresent squawking peacocks. 
</P>
<P>
Her tour group one recent morning consisted of a chatty bunch of 4th, 5th and 
6th graders from the talented and gifted program at Inglewood's Kelso 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
Even before they set out for the woolly monkey island, Collier had won their 
hearts, and more importantly, their attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I don't know if you've ever seen a drunk elephant before . . . " she said, 
her eyebrows raised and her delivery sounding like a cross between Johnny 
Carson and Mr. Wizard. 
</P>
<P>
She went on to explain that elephants aren't given alcohol at the zoo, but in 
the wild they eat fermented marula fruit and whole herds get tipsy on them. To 
the delight of her listeners, she pulled a dried marula fruit out of her 
handbag. 
</P>
<P>
Interspersed in her stories, such as how the zookeepers collect saliva samples 
from female rhinoceroses for pregnancy tests, are important messages, such as 
how poachers have pushed the animals close to extinction. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're giving tours, if you start to lose them, you change the pace," she 
said during an interview. "You either get humorous, get gory, get surprising . 
. . or you talk about courtship!" 
</P>
<P>
For her straggling band of elementary school students, Collier used the zoo's 
colony of woolly monkeys as a springboard to talk about the disappearance of 
the tropical rain forests. 
</P>
<P>
"We care about the rain forests because we love the animals and they're in our 
hearts," she said. Besides, she tells the youngsters, when the rain forests are 
gone, so is chocolate, because the cacao seeds that make real chocolate are 
grown only there. "And how would we live without chocolate?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't," replied Antoinette Marble, 11, sharing a somber look with the 
"60-something" Collier. 
</P>
<P>
After so many years at the zoo, Collier knows the turf like a second home and 
its residents like old friends. She fondly greeted Evelyn, a gorilla who blows 
kisses, and noted that Zombo, the dominant silverback male, could be pounding 
on his chest just to show off. 
</P>
<P>
At the anteater exhibit, she got groans from the Kelso students with a pun 
about all the "anti-bodies" that are given the animals to keep them healthy in 
captivity. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, as she chatted and clowned, Collier sought to educate. The smell 
emanating from the gorillas is the male gorilla's sweat, she said, and not what 
an 11-year-old delicately referred to as "bathroom." 
</P>
<P>
The meerkats, prairie dog-like rodents, are not only sociable, she said, but 
smart. "Find the lookout," she said, and the children were quick to spot a lone 
rodent atop a rock, scanning the sky for hawks. 
</P>
<P>
Why are the female peacocks so dully marked, when their mates are so 
resplendent? "Because the girl doesn't have to attract the guy?" asked 
11-year-old Nicholas Rice. "That's part of it," Collier replied. She also told 
the children to think about camouflage, and how it would protect "somebody 
sitting on a nest, trying to hide." 
</P>
<P>
Collier's enthusiasm has never dimmed, she said, because she loves the zoo, she 
loves children, and she loves animals. 
</P>
<P>
Her love of the zoo may have something to do with its location, she said. She 
and her husband, Harold, courted in Griffith Park before their wedding 50 years 
ago this month. Twenty-six years later, when the zoo opened at its present site 
in 1966, she gave her first tour. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to the children, junior high students are Collier's favorites. 
"They are kind of incorrigible, and pretend they're not interested in anything 
you've got to say. I take that as a challenge," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Collier's love of animals is one born of close observation and a delight in the 
surprises the animal kingdom offers. A favorite memory is the day she watched a 
mother siamang gibbon make her body into a hammock underneath her baby in order 
to protect the youngster as it practiced crawling upside-down on the wire 
ceiling of the cage. 
</P>
<P>
To her, the quiet scene was as entertaining as watching the saliva collection 
at the rhinoceros enclosure. This was done, by the way, with a basket of apples 
to make the mother rhino drool, while a keeper collects a sample with a 
long-handled cup. 
</P>
<P>
The only thing Collier doesn't like to watch at the zoo is the clock, which 
inevitably steals time she wishes she could spend showing children the 
two-headed snake, toucans and other exotic animals. 
</P>
<P>
Limping slightly, but outpacing her brood of the day, Collier breathlessly 
dashed to a cage housing four red-faced uakari monkeys from South America. 
These, she explained, are so rare they are only found in this zoo and in the 
endangered rain forests. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we're late," she said apologetically, "but this may be the only chance 
you'll ever get to see a uakari, and I couldn't let you miss them." 
</P>
<P>
The tour was over, with little fanfare, at the 11:30 a.m. bird show, where 
Collier caught her breath and giggled at the crow that untied the keeper's 
shoelace in a gag she's seen dozens of times. 
</P>
<P>
"I never get tired of this," she said. "I really got a kick out of these kids 
today."

TEACHER LESS THAN IMPRESSED BY GRIPES OF LOSING CANDIDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One message that is becoming very clear in this current business-political year 
is that "arrogance and indifference" do not sell well with the general public. 
Whether it is Donald Trump, a world leader or a small-fry politician, the 
public's attitude has been one of rejection. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, defeated candidate Kenneth Manning has complained about his loss in 
the 52nd Assembly Republican "primary" (Times, June 24). The fact is that Mr. 
Manning only garnered 17% of the actual vote, and only 6% of the registered 
Republicans, hardly a "mandate" for anyone who understands simple math. 
</P>
<P>
Much of that 17% came on the shirttails of his father, Tag Manning, who in his 
own right earned his political respect, instead of assuming that it was his 
"natural right" as did son Kenneth Manning. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Manning hasn't endeared himself to the employees of the Hacienda La Puente 
School District or the community. Mr. Manning was the principal effort in 
leading the board to spend over $326,000 on a stadium at Wilson High School 
while approving $3 million in cuts in the school budget. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Manning did little if anything to bring about a resolve in the teachers' 
labor impasse of 22 months even though he advertised himself as the 
"educational candidate." Nor did Mr. Manning project much of a democratic image 
to the students of our district when he arrogantly stated that all other 
candidates should just quit the primary race because they didn't have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
Do we really need a Board of Education member or an Assembly representative 
that mocks the democratic process, speaks with a double tongue on party unity 
or publicly embarrasses everyone with his completely unsportsmanlike behavior 
as a "bad loser?" 
</P>
<P>
As far as Mr. Manning's penchant with conservatism goes, if George Washington, 
Thomas Jefferson, John Adams and the rest of our forefathers were ultra 
conservative, we would still be singing "God Bless the Queen," and this country 
wouldn't exist.

A VOTE FOR LA VERNE'S 'SMALL TOWN CHARACTER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For those who still misunderstand the purpose of the La Verne Small Town 
Preservation Committee's initiative or "Bob Mastro's" lawsuit against the 
Edwards Cinema Co. and the city of La Verne (Times, March 25), let me try 
again. 
</P>
<P>
First of all, the "1,000 seat" initiative now exempts all nonprofit 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the lawsuit was filed by several property owners and residents of La 
Verne, not one individual alone. Third, our intention is to limit the size of 
the proposed theater, not its existence. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Edwards personally has refused to compromise with us on the theater's size. 
The proposed theater will seat 2,950 people, be 64,000 square feet in size, an 
acre and a half, and be equal to a five-story building at its highest point. 
</P>
<P>
The city of La Verne and Mr. Edwards have refused to listen to the citizens of 
La Verne. If the merits of our lawsuit are unfounded, why has Judge John 
Zebrowski of the L.A. Superior Court extended his stay order against the 
issuance of grading and building permits for the Edwards project indefinitely? 
</P>
<P>
Property owners within 300 feet of adjacent property to be rezoned are to be 
notified by law of that pending change. I was so notified. Taxpayers should be 
interested in changes which may affect them. I am. 
</P>
<P>
Businessmen should be more than involved and concerned with business 
development in their area, but also the compatibility and appropriateness of 
each development in the city as a whole. I am. 
</P>
<P>
People should be concerned for other people and with maintaining the quality of 
life for all. I am. 
</P>
<P>
Someone has to be concerned enough to fight to maintain as best as possible La 
Verne's small town character. For the record, I am.

VALUES: THE DEBATE OVER SOCIAL ISSUES IS A REHASHING OF BATTLES FROM THE '60S 
-- BATTLES ALREADY DECIDED. BUT IT IS EASIER THAN TRYING TO SOLVE TODAY'S 
DIFFICULT SOCIAL PROBLEMS.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Texas, the school system is in financial turmoil, the prisons are more 
crowded than the office buildings and the state may soon face a budget deficit 
deep enough to rattle the teeth of whichever party has its hands on the wheel 
when it hits. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the most spirited exchange in the past few weeks between the state's 
gubernatorial contenders came when Republican Clayton Williams accused Democrat 
Ann Richards of lacking sufficient vigilance against flag burning. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the county attorney in this exuberant university and capital town -- 
ostensibly among the most liberal in the state -- recently joined colleagues in 
San Antonio and Florida in warning record stores that they could be prosecuted 
for selling the records of the rap group 2 Live Crew to minors. 
</P>
<P>
For the past few weeks, U.S. politics has been fixated on such questions -- 
from the debate over a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning, to the 
struggle over National Endowment for the Arts funding for artists deemed by 
some obscene. 
</P>
<P>
This is a sour agenda, even for a nation in a surprisingly sour mood on its 
birthday. After a brief upsurge during the 1988 campaign, Americans are once 
again telling pollsters they consider the country to be fundamentally on the 
wrong track. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly why so many Americans remain pessimistic about the country's direction 
is difficult to isolate. When the Wirthlin Group, a GOP polling firm, explored 
that question in a recent survey, it found a welter of concerns -- crime and 
drugs, the economy, social apathy, government paralysis -- but no unifying 
note. 
</P>
<P>
In this unfocused atmosphere, each side of the political spectrum continues to 
develop its own analysis of the uneasiness -- and to construct its political 
appeal on that base. By and large, liberals see the anxiety as concern about 
long-term economic trends. "The public's confidence that America will always be 
a strong place for economic opportunity is diminished," insists Democratic 
pollster Richard Maullin. "That's what is eating them." 
</P>
<P>
Many conservatives, meanwhile, portray the unhappiness as the product of a 
widespread sense that America has lost its moral bearings even as its economic 
system appears to be triumphing internationally. "With the end of the Cold 
War," conservative columnist Joseph Sobran observed recently, "it's time for a 
critical introspection we may have felt we could hardly afford earlier." 
</P>
<P>
That introspection may be overdue. But neither conservatives nor liberals have 
developed a vocabulary that positions them to lead it. Both are looking 
backward -- attempting to fit a complex new situation into tired rhetorical 
frameworks. 
</P>
<P>
The conservatives' continuing cultural offensive on the flag and obscenity 
illustrates the dynamic. It's not difficult to draw a list of social problems 
that may be exacerbated by fraying moral standards -- poor educational 
performance and widespread drug use, to name two. 
</P>
<P>
It is more difficult to list the ways that government can effectively reverse 
such fundamental social breakdowns. As GOP pollster William McInturff said, 
drugs are a difficult issue to bring home convincing progress reports on. Few 
politicians want to base their claim to moral leadership on a war that appears 
stalemated -- especially since so few have ideas about how to break out of the 
trenches. 
</P>
<P>
And so, to demonstrate their commitment to traditional values, conservatives 
have reached back to the sort of symbolic issues that worked for Richard M. 
Nixon in 1968. President Bush and the cultural conservatives in Congress are 
behaving like graying devotees of classic-rock radio stations: After all these 
years, they still can't let go of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, we are reduced to conflict without content. The debate over the 
flag-burning amendment or 2 Live Crew has the same relationship to a real 
contest of values as war games have to war: All the tactics and maneuvers of 
the real thing, with nothing, in fact, at stake. 
</P>
<P>
All this made more sense 20 years ago. Then, in the crucible of Vietnam, the 
civil-rights movement and the sexual revolution, real bullets were being fired 
on the cultural front. 
</P>
<P>
To the extent anti-war demonstrators defaced the flag, it was because they felt 
the country had desecrated the values it represented. And when middle America 
recoiled from those protests, it was because they understood that, along with 
the Stars and Stripes, the young protesters were rejecting many of the verities 
of their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the battles over increasing sexuality in the arts during the 1960s 
was largely a proxy for the overall social upheaval over the explosive shift in 
sexual mores that many found frightening and immoral. At issue was not just 
sex, but the value of traditional rules of order. 
</P>
<P>
Is such a debate occuring today? Does any significant segment of U.S. society 
consider America a malevolent force in the world; or even feel crimped by the 
middle-class values that define our nation -- veneration of work and family? 
</P>
<P>
If so, it's difficult to find evidence. We may not always live up to those 
ideals -- but few responsible voices celebrate the continued prevalence of 
divorce or the epidemic of illegitimate births among inner-city teens. Hardly 
anyone without tenure sings Vietnamese folk songs, or calls marriage a corrupt 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
Even polls of the baby boomers, now raising teen-agers of their own, typically 
find them agreeing that the 1960s went too far in rejecting traditional moral 
standards. As for younger people, any group that overwhelmingly gave its vote 
to Ronald Reagan can hardly be considered in revolt against anything but revolt 
itself. At this point, flag-burning embodies nothing as much as the passion for 
15 seconds on the evening news. What could be more American than that? 
</P>
<P>
The partisan histrionics in these choreographed clashes obscure the larger 
trend: The debates of the '60s have been, in the broadest sense, concluded. 
</P>
<P>
Though a minority remains unhappy with the outcome, greater social tolerance 
and sexual permissiveness are now inextricably part of our society; the 
exaggerated disaffection from America that marked the flag desecrations of that 
earlier era has been essentially expunged. If anything, the nation today 
suffers from an excess of complacency -- and for all their indignation at 
social excess, conservatives have not devoted much thought to combating social 
numbness. 
</P>
<P>
Liberals are having almost as much trouble fitting the confusing economic 
situation into their old framework. After resisting the message when Rep. 
Richard A. Gephardt and Jesse Jackson unfurled it in the 1988 presidential 
campaign, many Democrats -- with the encouragement of an influential book by 
GOP analyst Kevin Phillips -- are again rallying to the party's traditional 
populist argument, accusing the Reagan and Bush economic plans of favoring the 
rich. 
</P>
<P>
That's difficult to dispute -- but the populist argument only takes Democrats 
so far, economically or politically. The stagnantion in median family incomes 
-- the primary underlying source of economic anxiety -- dates to 1973, long 
before Reagan left Sacramento. No one is certain why inequality is widening in 
America, or why living standards for average families faltered in the early 
1970s after rising throughout the postwar era, but it is clear to all serious 
economists that more fundamental forces are at work than tax cuts and 
deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats may profitably play populist notes in the ongoing budget 
negotiations. But many believe the party cannot tap the middle class' economic 
concern solely by condemning greed at the top. 
</P>
<P>
As Democratic strategist Stanley B. Greenberg says, it is easy for the party 
"to convince the middle class we're against the rich, but that's not enough." 
Far more difficult, he says, is convincing middle-class voters that the party 
hears their concerns about rising costs of basic services and economic 
opportunity for their children. More difficult yet is developing an agenda that 
helps to raise productivity and living standards. 
</P>
<P>
Like the conservatives trying to address the social problems of the 1990s with 
the fading war cries of the 1960s, the liberal populists risk missing the real 
currents of public concern. No one denies these old hot buttons can generate 
powerful political emotions. But, in the long run, they cannot solve the 
biggest problem of the left and right alike: convincing voters they understand 
the realities of their lives today. Ultimately, for both parties, the price of 
nostalgia may be irrelevance.

WORLD LEADERS MEET TO PLAN ECONOMY -- BUT WHAT DO THEY CONTROL?;

SUMMIT: GATHERING TO PLOT THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, HEADS OF THE LEADING WESTERN 
NATIONS TRY TO CHART THEIR BRAVE NEW WORLD -- BUT WHO HAS THE MAP?

In ancient times, the Egyptian priests would gather each year in the temple of 
Isis, where they collectively invoked the prescribed incantations that, the 
faithful were assured, would facilitate the springtime rising of the Nile. The 
Nile, of course, sometimes rose and sometimes didn't, and contemporary scribes 
no doubt speculated on the qualities of priestly leadership that gave rise to 
successful or unhappy outcomes. 
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the seven mightiest nations in the Western world are gathering 
today in Houston to decide, not in a temple, but on a "summit," the future 
course of the world economy. No fewer than 4,000 journalists will attend the 
three-day occasion. Displays of bronco-busting will lighten the serious 
"working sessions" of the great men and woman -- there must have also been 
entertainments in ancient Egypt. The entire assemblage will smile giddily as 
they punish their stomachs with Texas barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
Probably few ordinary Egyptians wondered whether the priests really had the 
power they said they did. In our less polite age, doubts seem more widely 
spread. 
</P>
<P>
The first, and possibly the most controversial, summit item will be whether the 
Western nations should save the Soviet Union or, as it is sometimes phrased, 
"bail out" Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
The West German -- and putatively, pan-German -- chancellor, Helmut Kohl, has 
already promised $3 billion in trade credits for the Soviets. President 
Francois Mitterrand of France hopes the whole Western alliance can cough up $15 
billion. Pundits argue that if the United States doesn't evidence comparable 
open-handedness, it will no longer be viewed as a leader. 
</P>
<P>
There should be no confusion here with America's postwar Marshall Plan for 
Europe. Hard as it is to believe, the Marshall Plan commitments were greater 
than the annual defense budget. The recipient countries qualified for the aid 
by proposing specific plans for jump-starting their economies that, on the 
whole, worked. It was possibly the last episode in history of practical 
statesmanship on the grand scale. 
</P>
<P>
Whether that sink of corruption and confusion that is the Soviet economy will 
"survive" or not, or whether Gorbachev will maintain his grip on power will be 
determined by dark and tumultuous forces ripping the Soviet Union, which no 
Western analyst can pretend to understand. Surely, however, in a country that 
spends $300 billion on its military and sends $5 billion each year to Cuba, 
some shipments of Western TV sets and camcorders will hardly sway the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the Marshall Plan era, the issues surrounding aid to the Soviets 
are ones of ritual and self-interest. In a post-Cold War world, can Europe 
chart a foreign policy independent of the United States? Should the United 
States care if it did? Which country's merchants will get government financing 
for selling goods in a potentially huge, if murky, new market? How far can the 
West Europeans get away with using their budgets to finance exports to Eastern 
Europe, while the United States uses its budget to finance the military defense 
of Western Europe? 
</P>
<P>
From the great issues of world diplomacy, the leaders will turn to more mundane 
matters, where, collectively, there is a rare opportunity for positive 
accomplishment. The current bout of trade negotiations, the "Uruguay" round, is 
likely to founder on the issue of agricultural protectionism -- a kind of 
Berlin Wall of economic policy-making. 
</P>
<P>
It is conceivable, if by no means certain, that if all seven leaders denounced 
such policies, their trade negotiators might actually succeed in knocking a few 
chinks out of the agricultural wall. But in all likelihood, the issue will be 
passed over in an embarrassed silence, or with a few windy phrases reminding us 
that the seven leaders are, after all, just politicians trying to do their 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Considerable attention will be devoted to the economic reunification of 
Germany. For the last two years, government experts, economists and central 
bankers devoted much thought and effort to careful analysis of that problem, 
almost unanimously recommending measured caution and a long, slow process of 
gradual integration. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl, no economist, just a pit bull of a politician, ignored them all and 
reunification happened last week. The seven leaders, with Kohl's cooperation, 
will busy themselves constructing a record to prove that that was how they 
planned it all along. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the leaders will turn to that most treasured illusion of 
post-Keynesian policy-making. What sort of economic growth rates, inflation 
rates and currency values should the assembled governments prescribe for the 
industrialized countries? 
</P>
<P>
President Bush will receive considerable praise for his reversal on taxes. 
Presumably, if the United States increases its cigarette or gasoline taxes by, 
perhaps, $25 billion, and reduces its budget deficit, world savings will rise 
and everyone will march forward to a brighter, richer future. 
</P>
<P>
Baldly stating the proposition exposes its silliness -- $25 billion, even $50 
billion, is less than the counting error in a $15 trillion industrialized 
economy. In any case, the combined budget deficits of the industrialized 
countries have been reduced sharply during the past decade, from 4.2% of 
combined output in 1983, to only about 1.2% this year. Oddly, savings have 
dropped at the same time, not as rapidly, but substantially. 
</P>
<P>
The economic discussions at the summit are like the foam mosquito larvae make 
on a pool. The real economic forces run deep and massively. Patterns of work 
and savings are driven mostly by demographic change, such as the rapidly aging 
population of Japan and the maturing U.S. work force. The globalization of 
major industries, the decentralization of manufacturing -- Ford factories in 
Spain, Honda factories in Ohio -- the revolution in information services will 
determine the course of economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders, like parents, can do real damage if they work at it with both energy 
and malice. The recent lurching toward demagogic protectionism is, hopefully, a 
near-miss case in point. Summitry is a harmless enough illusion. It is probably 
better for world leaders to be friends and acquaintances than not. But the Nile 
will rise or not regardless.

Several years ago I escorted a group of American college students to an 
interview with the Speaker of the British House of Commons. The Speaker's 
schedule dictated that the meeting take place in the ornate dressing room where 
he was being enrobed before assuming his place on the dais that dominates the 
debating well between the tiered House benches. Arriving a bit late, we saw the 
back of a tall figure already mantled in a black gown. Attendants fluttered 
about him, draping various accouterments on his lanky frame. 
</P>
<P>
As he turned to greet us, an almost undetectable flicker of surprise ruffled 
his dignified composure. Then he surveyed the assemblage of young Americans, 
wearing shorts, T-shirts, sandals and baseball caps, being ushered into the 
vestment chamber of the Speaker of the Mother of Parliaments, and he proceeded 
to deliver a lecture. 
</P>
<P>
The lecture was not about dress standards -- though I've always suspected it 
was the students' attire that prompted it. It was about taking things for 
granted. More particularly, it was about taking freedom for granted. 
</P>
<P>
"Men have died for your freedom," he said in his booming Welsh baritone. The 
students looked as if they had just been slapped with a wet towel. Did real 
people talk like that? They had heard that sort of thing only in movies -- 
mostly black-and-white movies, the boring kind. What odd and sentimental folk 
these Brits were! 
</P>
<P>
Americans have had many occasions in recent months to witness this unsettling 
foreign tendency to speak with unabashed reverence about things like freedom 
and democracy. What's more, foreigners have adopted the discomforting habit of 
invoking our national icons and quoting our historic heroes in defense of 
liberty. President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia and Prime Minister Tadeusz 
Mazowiecki of Poland display easy familiarity with Thomas Jefferson; Lech 
Walesa as well as Soviet reformers and Romanian rebels cite Abraham Lincoln; 
Nelson Mandela lays a wreath at the tomb of Martin Luther King Jr., and, in the 
most dramatic cultural expropriation of all, Chinese students in Tian An Men 
Square parade a replica of Lady Liberty -- herself a gift to the United States 
from the people of France. 
</P>
<P>
Surely we are all proud that our national symbols, and the values for which 
they stand, are honored by other peoples. But many Americans also find the 
practice rather quaint, a kind of unsophisticated incantation by simple-minded 
foreigners who know our history only superficially and therefore have not yet 
acquired our worldly attitudes of iconoclasm and, especially, hero-bashing. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign visitors may gaze on the statuary in the Capitol and see the emblems of 
elemental political forces and powerful cultural values; we see some enmarbled 
guys -- and a few women -- whose latter-day handlers managed to pull off a neat 
media stunt that got them turned into permanent tourist attractions. We know 
that all those characters pulled their trousers on one leg at a time, that they 
had their full quota of human frailties, that there are no giants on the earth. 
Familiarity may not breed contempt, but it surely demystifies. We are too well 
acquainted with our historical selves to be awed. Perhaps our self-knowledge 
has robbed us of the capacity to be inspired. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, in an arresting inversion of the behavior that finds our own prophets 
more honored in other lands, we have recently poured our own adulation 
unrestrainedly over two visitors from abroad: Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Mandela. 
Gorbachev's visit to Stanford University in June elicited the kind of frenzied 
adoration once tendered only by mobs of pubescent women to rock megastars. In a 
great university committed to cultivating the domain of reason, all classes 
were canceled and throngs of jostling, shouting, waving people surged behind 
the police barricades, aching for a glimpse of the Soviet leader. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller but no less passionate crowds greeted Mandela wherever he appeared. No 
imaginable American political figure could command such displays of affection 
and enthusiasm. Indeed, public figures from Jesse Jackson to George Deukmejian 
clamored to get in the same camera-frame with Mandela and Gorbachev, just to 
bask in their reflected glory. 
</P>
<P>
Again, Americans are justifiably enthused about Gorbachev's attempt to reshape 
Soviet society, and Mandela's struggle to bring racial justice to South Africa. 
But why are we so passive and jaded about appeals to modernize our own rickety 
social infrastructure, or rutted streets and crowded schools? Why are we 
increasingly so cantankerous and confrontational about our own racial problems? 
Why so intent on demythologizing all our national heroes, so fiercely resistant 
to affording to any living American the claim to be able to inspire us? 
</P>
<P>
Just as we find the world's excitement about our political values to be a kind 
of flattering curiosity, so do we seem more willing to cheer political change 
at a distance than close at hand, more apt to lionize the visitors, not the 
locals. 
</P>
<P>
What's going on here? Partly, one supposes, we cheer Havel and Gorbachev and 
Mandela with abandon because we are emotionally invested exclusively in their 
success. It won't be for us to suffer the disemployment and inflation and 
uncertainty and, quite possibly, the violence that will in all likelihood 
attend their various struggles to transform their countries. For us, their 
efforts will be gain without pain. At home, in contrast, we sense the real 
discomfort that change must entail -- higher taxes; ragged, tiring 
argumentation; close, demanding inter-racial dialogue and concessions. 
</P>
<P>
This much history we do know: However attractive democracy might be in the 
abstract, it has proved a messy and painful business in practice. And that's 
why we need periodically to re-trim the vessel that is carrying us on our 
national journey. The sober idealism of Jefferson and Lincoln and King is 
weighty ballast for the ship of state, both in stormy seas and in periods, like 
the present, of sullen calm. We need their visionary captaincy now as much as 
ever. Those struggling to launch democracies know this, and we who should be 
trying to stay the course shouldn't forget it. This is one thing that cannot be 
taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
As that black-gowned Welshman said to my students, some things are worth dying 
for. We may not be called upon to do the actual dying, but if we don't reckon 
democracy that kind of value, democracy itself surely will.

THE LEGACY OF CHERNOBYL;

BOOK MARK: THE SOVIET UNION TRIED TO KEEP THE DISASTER AT CHERNOBYL A SECRET, 
BUT AS THE TOXIC PLUME MOVED ACROSS EUROPE, THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS RADIOACTIVE 
VOLCANO BECAME APPARENT. IN HIS BOOK, 'THE LEGACY OF CHERNOBYL,' ZHORES 
MEDVEDEV DESCRIBES THE COVER-UP.

By Zhores Medvedev, Zhores Medvedev is a biochemist who has written several

<TEXT>
<P>
The 10 days from April 26 to May 6, 1986, have become known in Soviet 
literature as the "Battle of Chernobyl." There were no direct reports from 
Chernobyl in those 10 days. At that stage, the people directly or indirectly 
responsible for the accident controlled the emergency measures. They had 
nothing to gain and a great deal to lose from glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts to cover up inconvenient information and a tendency to shift 
responsibility were immediately apparent. They became even stronger later, 
particularly during and after the trial in July, 1987, of the director of the 
Chernobyl station and his deputies and engineering team. The proceedings of the 
trial were kept secret -- not because classified technical information was 
divulged, but because they were too embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the accident helped in the initial effort to cover it up. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that the accident took place at night had one obvious advantage: There 
were few people in the immediate vicinity. The first concentrated cloud of 
radioactive debris, aerosol and gases that formed over the reactor passed over 
parts of the town of Pripyat, Yanov station and villages nearby. But most 
people were asleep indoors, protected from the radiation to some extent by the 
walls of their houses. Moreover, the night shift in the station was smaller 
than the day shifts. During the day shifts, for example, more than 2,000 
workers normally worked on the construction sites at Units 5 and 6 at 
Chernobyl. There were far fewer people around at 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
It is now known that the explosion that destroyed the reactor core in the early 
hours of April 26, 1986, blew nearly 20 million curies of radioactive materials 
and several million curies of the inert radioactive gases xenon-133 and 
krypton-85 into the atmosphere. Although the reports of the trial do not 
disclose the actual level of radiation, it was alleged that one local official 
"deliberately reduced the levels of radioactivity by several orders of 
magnitude" when he reported the situation to his superiors. 
</P>
<P>
This attempt to lay the blame for the initial cover-up on the local 
administrators -- who, it is implied, thereby made it difficult for Moscow 
officials to assess the disaster immediately -- is misleading. 
</P>
<P>
During the trial of station officials in July, 1987, it was reported 
that,"(Chernobyl station director Viktor) Bryukhanov and the former shift 
foreman, Boris Rogozhkin, were responsible for not taking the measures 
envisaged in the evacuation plan. Moreover, almost the entire shift that came 
to work at 8 a.m. remained unnecessarily at the station. 
</P>
<P>
"The population of Pripyat was not warned about the accident, nor were the 
civil-defense headquarters informed. Since the civil-defense staff had no 
information about the situation, they took no measures. As a result, the usual 
rhythm of life on a Saturday proceeded . . . . The evacuation began only 36 
hours later and was conducted according to a newly worked-out plan." 
</P>
<P>
But it is not fair to only blame local officials. One account of the accident 
makes it clear that officials in Moscow did not understand they were dealing 
with a catastrophe of global dimensions. There are signs, too, of an initial 
attempt to hide what had happened. The decision-making process seems to have 
been deliberately slow to preserve a facade of "business as usual." The 
chairman of the commission formed to handle the situation was allowed, for 
example, to complete a routine, rather unimportant meeting. It was probably 
hoped that if there were no sign of crisis, rumors of the accident could be 
prevented. 
</P>
<P>
Another indication that Moscow did not comprehend the seriousness of the 
accident was the low status of the commission first set up to handle the 
accident. Normally, when an industrial or natural disaster is considered to be 
nationally or internationally important, an energy commission is set up under a 
member or candidate member of the Politburo. Few people, even in the Soviet 
Union, knew commission chair Boris Shcherbina, one of more than a dozen deputy 
prime ministers. When it became clear a few days later that the Shcherbina 
commission lacked the necessary power to deal with the accident, a parallel, 
superior commission was set up under Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, a member of the 
Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the situation deteriorated hourly. Throughout the night of April 26, 
the level of radioactivity in the air continued to increase. Gen. Vladmir 
Pikalov, the commander of chemical services for the Soviet Army who was 
dispatched to the scene, decided to inspect the destroyed reactor. As Pikalov 
and his driver drew closer to the reactor building, they noticed the air above 
the ruins was fluorescent. There were no flames, just the eerie light. 
</P>
<P>
Pikalov understood the cause, but did not know how to deal with it. He decided 
to try something desperate. He took a special armored car equipped for 
radiological reconnaissance and drove to the plant. The gates were closed. 
Dismissing his driver, Pikalov took the wheel himself and smashed through the 
gates. He stopped near the destroyed building to take measurements. It was only 
then, more than 20 hours after the original explosion, that it was definitely 
established that the graphite of the reactor core was burning, that the core 
was still melting and that the reactor continued to release enormous quantities 
of radioactivity and heat. 
</P>
<P>
At 7 a.m. Sunday, April 27, Pikalov and the group of nuclear experts who had 
spent the night discussing his findings, reported the situation to the 
government commission. The commission in turn reported to the Kremlin. Pikalov 
probably also reported to his military superiors in the Ministry of Defense. 
This was the first proper information received by the leaders of the Soviet 
Union about the scale of the disaster and its possible consequences. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the government commission arrived in Pripyat, it was clear that if 
the reactor was still releasing enormous amounts of radioactive material, the 
danger to the local population was mounting rapidly. Evacuation was clearly 
indicated, but the commission's medical officers wanted to delay it, on the 
ground that the radiation level in Pripyat was not high enough. 
</P>
<P>
Although the authorities knew the gravity of the situation, they did not 
realize the radioactive plume had crossed the Soviet border and that the 
accident had acquired international dimensions. The radiation monitoring 
service had probably not yet been able to summarize the contours of the plume 
and offer computer predictions of its movements. There was still hope that the 
accident could be covered up. And as long as there was that chance, local radio 
and television could not be used to advise people to stay indoors. Thus people 
in Kiev were not informed of the accident and the evacuees from Pripyat were 
moved only a short distance, to villages in the Polessky district, 40 
kilometers southwest of Chernobyl. 
</P>
<P>
The news blackout was partly lifted on May 6, when Soviet journalists were 
allowed to send "heroic" reports from Chernobyl, including some details of the 
"great battle" that, it was claimed, had already been won. However, no 
technical details were given. 
</P>
<P>
It was feared that public trust in nuclear energy would be undermined. Both the 
Soviet government and the nuclear industry wanted to preserve the momentum of 
the nuclear energy program. It was not only a crucial element of the Soviet 
Five-Year Plan and of the long-term plan to the year 2000, it was also the 
cornerstone of plans to integrate the economies of the Soviet Union and the 
countries of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The Chernobyl accident had serious repercussions for the Five-Year Plan, set to 
be presented during the Supreme Soviet session in June. But the government was 
unwilling to reconsider it at such short notice and no changes were made. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-day news blackout on Chernobyl may have harmed the reputation of the 
Soviet government and its new policy of glasnost, but it did not surprise 
anyone who lives and works in the Soviet Union. Glasnost was new. It had not 
yet become a trend that could be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, this short-sighted attitude made the emergency work more costly, 
particularly in terms of human health. But there was probably also a reluctance 
to appear helpless, and the Soviet government was helpless until the inferno of 
the graphite fire and the huge releases of radioactive products were 
controlled. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the news blackout were thus primarily domestic. 
</P>
<P>
No one knows what is left inside the sarcophagus and whether the Chernobyl 
radioactive volcano is really dead. Nor do they know whether it will be safe 
for future generations.

THE MISSING LINK IN THE BEST-LAID PLANS OF TRANSPORTATION MANAGERS; 
</P>
<P>
CONGESTION: THE LITTLE TRIP THAT WORKING PARENTS MAKE TO TAKE THEIR CHILDREN TO 
A CARE PROVIDER CREATES A LOT OF POLLUTION AND TRAFFIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbara Keeler, Barbara Keeler is an educational writer and author of Energy 
Alternatives, to be published in September by Lucent Books. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Exasperated with the freeway crawl and with noxious fumes, California voters 
agreed early last month to pay for some transportation relief by raising the 
gas tax. But most commuters ill experience little comfort -- especially working 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Quality Management District's commuter program, for example, neglects 
the needs of workers who must drive their children to school or to child-care 
facilities. The plan asks employers to help reduce drive-alone commutes from 6 
a.m. to 10 a.m. Employers are supposed to reward workers who participate in 
ride-sharing programs, use public transit, agree to a compressed work week or 
reduce drive-alone trips by other means. 
</P>
<P>
Day-care centers unfortunately aren't geared to 10-hour days, four times aweek. 
Car pools and public transit are also less satisfying options for workers who 
are parents. Before catching the bus, a parent must typically drive a short 
distance to take his or her child to the care provider. 
</P>
<P>
Starting a cold engine for a five-mile drive produces 60% of the pollution a 
20-mile trip does, according to the AQMD. A program designed to improve air 
quality by reducing the number of vehicle trips, then, must take into account 
the needs of working parents. Otherwise, its benefits, at best, will be 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
It's not surprising that child-care needs have been overlooked as a 
work-related and transportation issue. Today's concept of childhood is quite 
different from the days when father and son, mother and daughter worked 
side-by-side at home. After the Industrial Revolution, families just moved 
closer to the factories. 
</P>
<P>
With the advent of child-labor laws, the wives of men working at the factories 
stayed home with the children, largely remaining there until the 1950s. 
Exceptions were made during the two world wars, when women had to fill factory 
positions left vacant by men in the armed forces. During World War II, 
factories provided excellent child-care centers for workers, but the facilities 
were closed after the men returned from the war. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1950s, relatives and neighbors took care of the children of working 
parents. But as more and more women entered the work force, fewer neighbors and 
relatives were available. More divorces and escalating living costs were also 
factors driving women into the job market. A growing number of parents began to 
take their children to day-care centers and licensed homes located outside 
their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
By 1987, 55% of working women had children younger than 6 years of age. A 1988 
study by the California Department of General Services showed that of 2,729 
state employees surveyed, nearly 20% drove their children to or from school or 
day care. Ninety percent of the drivers were women. The trip to the child-care 
provider added, on average, eight miles to the round-trip commute. 
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicated that parents did not walk or bicycle their children 
to school or day care. Among parents with children at home, ride-sharing 
dropped one-third; among working women with children, use of public transit 
declined by three-fifths. Because most users of public transit are women, the 
survey results suggest that the ability of buses, light rail and trains to 
solve the state's transportation problems is limited. 
</P>
<P>
Happily, more employers are beginning to offer child-care programs. Los Angeles 
County, for example, provides excellent child care for its employees, 
alleviating many of the worries facing working parents. But it does not take 
their transportation needs into account, since the centers are only located at 
hospitals. Workers assigned to other, sometimes distant county sites must still 
detour to deliver and pick up their children. 
</P>
<P>
Child care at the work site offers employers more than a tremendous recruiting 
advantage. It is also good transportation policy, since the extra miles that 
parents drive to child-care providers would be eliminated. However, the effect 
on ride-sharing programs and the appeal of alternative transportation would be 
minimal. Few parents would take three children on a bus, and a father or mother 
driving three children to the work place would not be among the most popular 
ride-sharing partners. 
</P>
<P>
Some employers, including government agencies, have considered guaranteeing 
ride-sharers and transit users transportation for personal emergencies. They 
have also considered restricting on-site child care to workers who ride-share 
or use alternative transportation. 
</P>
<P>
One emerging child-care strategy could increase use of public transit. Some 
transportation agencies are planning to build child-care facilities at transit 
stations or at park-and-ride lots. Such a facility opened this year on the 
light rail-line of the City of San Diego Metro Transit Authority. In San Jose, 
one is being considered at a point where buses, light rail and commuter trains 
meet. It would include care for mildly ill children, a service working parents 
sorely need. Boston, Atlanta, the Port of New Jersey and the County of San 
Diego are conducting feasibility studies for locating child-facilities care in 
existing transportation centers or along major transportation corridors. 
</P>
<P>
Child-care facilities at residential sites would probably best serve parental 
needs and ease traffic congestion. These centers could organize car pools to 
drive children to neighborhood schools. Parents willing and able to walk, 
bicycle or take a bus to work could eliminate car trips altogether. 
</P>
<P>
By whatever means, transportation-demand managers must make provisions in their 
plans for the growing percentage of workers who require child care. A commuter 
plan that ignores the needs of a large segment of the work force is doomed to 
fall short of its goals of reducing miles driven and number of trips made.

SNYDER: LIVING -- AND DYING -- FOR THE CAUSE OF HOMELESSNESS 
</P>

Radio's Saturday news show, Weekend Edition.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several years ago, I decided I could no longer report on Mitch Snyder's 
activities. Life is too short and compromising to spend much energy trying to 
be skeptical about someone risking his death and devoting his life to people 
living in the street. Snyder liked to point out that, in his previous careers 
as a car thief, hot-check artist and Manhattan business consultant, he had been 
called corrupt, consumed and greedy -- but never crazy. That, he insisted, only 
began when he turned his life over to what has become known as the cause of the 
homeless. A cause he lived for until his death on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A day before the 1984 elections, he ended a 51-day fast when the Reagan 
Administration agreed to donate an old federal building for a shelter -- the 
same shelter he hanged himself in. He told reporters after that fast, as he was 
being wheeled into a hospital emergency room, "What can I say? You all look 
like hamburgers to me." One could not doubt it. 
</P>
<P>
To official Washington, that part of the city that seems to live by the corner 
office, the power tie and the official car, Snyder presented himself with 
irritating calculation as a man who dressed in donated army-surplus clothes and 
spent nights sleeping on steam grates. He urged reporters to spend a night 
beside him on the street -- "Don't write about it, just do it," he urged us, 
"understand it." 
</P>
<P>
He would point out, like a man showing features of his hometown that only he 
knew to strangers, how a whole other city stirred into being during the small 
hours after midnight: Men and women slumbering in shrouds of cloth scraps on 
the staircase of the Lincoln Memorial; children being soothed to sleep by their 
mothers inside of cardboard cartons, set up like subdivisions near the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder's most unsettling tactic was to go without food, in a city where catered 
shrimp on the buffet table is part of the corporate diet. Years ago, we had a 
dull argument when I asked if his fasts weren't imitative and coercive. 
</P>
<P>
"Look," he said, "if I ran into a house on fire to rescue someone who was 
trapped, would you call that coercive? A fast is a way of trying to rescue 
someone who could die if no one cares enough to risk his life." 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, when I would spend a few hours trying to help cook and serve 
holiday dinners in the downtown shelter, you practically had to make a 
reservation to scrub a pan. Tourists, concerned suburbanites, students and 
confirmed volunteers would crowd the kitchen, desperate to cut carrots. Rather 
like a Hollywood restaurant, servers would rush back through swinging doors, 
saying, "Cher! I saw her! And Martin Sheen, too!" 
</P>
<P>
"Sorry I didn't call ahead," I told him this past Christmas. He said, only half 
joking, "Don't worry. You're always welcome." 
</P>
<P>
The shelter he helped create downtown is often overcrowded in the winter, 
sweltering and perilous in the summer and a dangerous place to sleep in any 
season. People often curl the two or three things they care most in the world 
about under their arms at night -- a radio, some shoes, a picture -- and try to 
fall asleep while clenched like a fist. People wheeze with the sickness they 
have picked up from the streets. Drugs and drunkenness have been more difficult 
to keep out than the cold. Snyder had been increasingly worried about that, 
wondering if his shelter was only helping the city to slide homeless people 
onto a separate shelf. 
</P>
<P>
This spring, he refused to admit census takers into the shelter. His opposition 
to what seemed a decently intentioned step to understand the depth of 
homelessness surprised some of his supporters, but he told them the shelter was 
a home. People living in Potomac River suburbs wouldn't look up from their beds 
at night to see census takers counting the number of noses between their 
sheets. People living at the shelter deserved the same dignity. 
</P>
<P>
Snyder's sometimes aggravating activism brought homelessness into focus for 
millions of Americans. But during the past 10 years, it seems to have passed 
from being a moral scandal into a feature of American life. Last Christmas, he 
was enthusiastic that the prospects for peace in the world would make greater 
devotion to homeless people here possible. But by this spring, he had seen the 
promise swallowed by the threat of the federal deficit, by the political appeal 
of aid to Eastern Europe and by malingering indifference. Last month the 
Washington City Council voted to reduce the city's obligation to provide 
shelter for every citizen. Snyder seemed to read it as a sign that a decade of 
the most dramatic stunts and risks to make us care about those who lived in our 
streets had still failed to create a constituency for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
In a time when much in our politics and culture was urging Americans to be rid 
of guilt, Mitch Snyder was asking us to listen to voices that made us twitch 
with discomfort for being fortunate. "Thanks for coming," he would often say 
when you left the shelter. "You can go home and take a hot shower. The people 
still outside can't." He was a hard friend that way, annoying and boorish and, 
damn him, bless him, always much too right.

DISASTER RELIEF FOR VICTIMS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES

<TEXT>
<P>
Throughout my 16 years as a firefighter/paramedic, I have witnessed many 
horrible incidents. The recent destructive fires are among those experiences. 
</P>
<P>
I am amazed at the difficulty we have passing laws which ban wood roofs or the 
difficulty we have getting compliance from homeowners in clearing flammable 
brush from around their homes. 
</P>
<P>
The California State Firemen's Assn. and many other fire service organizations 
have pushed for a ban on wood roofs in new construction, pushed to ban the 
private use of fireworks, pushed for laws to require the installation of 
residential sprinklers in new construction, pushed for laws which protect your 
lives and property; how successful do you feel we have been? 
</P>
<P>
I can assure you that the effort will continue at the state and local levels, 
yet we need your voice. We are having difficulty getting two legislative bills 
passed as we wrote them; AB 2666 by Assemblywoman Bev Hansen and SB 1830 by 
Sen. Cecil Green, which would have permitted local governments to pass building 
standards more restrictive than state law, have been significantly amended to 
our dissatisfaction and to the detriment of local control and fire safety. 
</P>
<P>
You can help by writing to the Senate Housing Committee, Chairman Leroy Greene, 
2205 State Capitol, Sacramento 95814, and asking him to see that these bills 
are passed to our satisfaction.

I can keep this short and to the point: How many military helicopters sat as 
the recent fires consumed Southern California? I suggest some tax dollars be 
devoted to water-carrying equipment for these hundreds, maybe thousands of idle 
military "sorry-we-weren't-trained-for-that" helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
We should be able to send a fleet of water-dumping helicopters to any hot spot, 
especially those close to the coast. 
</P>
<P>
We live by the ocean; fire is a real problem; fresh water is in short supply, 
and salt water can put out fires. We need to plan and prepare for fires.

CLEARING AWAY ALL THE POLITICAL SMOKE; 
</P>
<P>
WHY A STATEWIDE SMOKING BAN WOULD BE GOOD, BUT STATE PREEMPTION BAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It sounded eminently fair -- even magnanimous -- when the California Restaurant 
Assn. announced its support of an outright statewide ban of smoking in 
restaurants -- as long as smoking is banned in other public places. Why pick on 
restaurants? 
</P>
<P>
Why indeed: A state legislative ban, the restaurant association argues, should 
dictate a consistent government attitude toward smoking in public places. Now, 
restaurateurs say, local ordinances regulating smoking make for a piecemeal 
approach. True. It's one reason why we've expressed doubts about a proposed ban 
in L.A. city restaurants: The ban would be better if it were broader in 
geographical scope. But it is also true that the effects of second-hand smoke 
are serious. Passive smoke, the smoke that nonsmokers involuntarily inhale, is 
thought to be a leading cause of preventable death. 
</P>
<P>
So, the association suggests that smoking be prohibited in all public places. 
That's right, in principle. But how successful the proposal will be depends on 
what a "public place" is and whether the Legislature will display a heretofore 
unevidenced gumption in resisting hard lobbying from the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, Sacramento shows no signs of reversing its tendency to bend to the needs 
of the tobacco interests. On the contrary. Take a look at a tobacco bill by 
Assemblyman Richard Polanco, (D-Los Angeles). At first glance it sounds great. 
But it would have the effect of weakening the local controls on access to 
tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, AB 3967, which this week was amended to make it slightly less 
objectionable, would set up state standards to govern tobacco sample giveaways. 
That sounds reasonable. But it also would preempt local governments from 
passing or enforcing tougher laws that ban promotional giveaways to potential 
smokers. This bill is opposed by health advocates long familiar with 
Sacramento's smoked-filled rooms. Rightly so. 
</P>
<P>
As for the restaurateurs, logically they're right, but as a practical matter a 
bill on banning smoking in public is not going to happen. A statewide 
restaurant smoking ban is a good -- and possibly even achievable -- start.

BUSH VETOES FAMILY LEAVE BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I heard on the news that President Bush thinks it is bad for big business to 
grant 12 weeks unpaid family leave to parents. I can't believe that a man with 
the family he has, and the grandchildren he has and the beliefs that he says he 
has, would allow this to happen. 
</P>
<P>
It is bad enough to have "unpaid" leave, but to not grant any leave at all, how 
can he do this? 
</P>
<P>
I believe that President Bush needs a few lessons in compassion and 
understanding, something we were led to believe he had when he was running for 
office, but then again, we never do ever really know the person running for 
office until it is too late. 
</P>
<P>
I think we should take a good look at future candidates and ask questions about 
him that are for the good of the people and not just big business. This world 
is getting smaller and smaller, and if we don't come together as a unit, we 
aren't going to be much good to anyone in the long-run.

During the recent heat wave, at about midnight, we were awakened by a stranger 
ringing our doorbell.

<P>
He was driving on Rodeo Road and told us that the planting area at the rear of 
our property was on fire. I called the Fire Department and was told it had 
already been reported. Another stranger seeing the situation had gone to the 
nearest phone and called the Fire Department. The damage was minimal.

Both gentlemen stayed with us until there was no longer any danger. We do not

While Stallone attempts to branch out, Arnold Schwarzenegger is getting ready 
to go back into action in "Terminator 2: Judgment Day," expected to begin 
rolling in early October in and around L.A. 
</P>
<P>
James Cameron -- who made his directorial debut with the original "Terminator" 
(1984) -- produces, directs and co-writes with William Wisher. (A longtime 
friend and former college roommate of Cameron's, Wisher worked as a consultant 
on the original "Terminator" -- and wrote the film's novelization.) 
</P>
<P>
This time out, the story involves John Connor, the young and troubled son (he's 
already got a police record) of "Terminator's" tough heroine, Sarah Connor, 
again played by Linda Hamilton. Michael Biehn -- the futuristic soldier of "I" 
-- will also be back. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Schwarzenegger's in the midst of starring in the action-comedy 
"Kindergarten Cop," which reunites him with "Twins" director Ivan Reitman. Pat

OUTTAKES: NOT A GENUINE TIFFANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
One person who won't be buying a ticket to "Jetsons: The Movie": actress Janet 
Waldo. 
</P>
<P>
Waldo voiced the character of Judy Jetson for the animated series, which ran on 
all three networks between 1962 and 1983 and is now in syndication. 
</P>
<P>
She'd reprised the role for the just-out Universal feature film -- and then got 
dumped for youthful pop singer Tiffany. 
</P>
<P>
All because Hanna-Barbera Prod. figures Tiffany -- who performs songs on the 
sound track, and is under contract to MCA Records -- will sell more tickets. 
</P>
<P>
"I was totally crushed," says Waldo. "I originated the character, and I feel 
very sentimental about Judy. If they had recast the whole show, there wouldn't 
have been any problem at all. But the fact that my part was the only one that 
was changed just threw me. I felt it was very disloyal (of Hanna and Barbera)." 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand how Janet feels," Bill Hanna responds. "It was purely a 
business decision, based on the thought that Tiffany would bring in more 
dollars at the box office." 
</P>
<P>
Waldo, who has played numerous characters in other Hanna-Barbera cartoon shows, 
had recorded all her dialogue as Judy and been paid in full when she learned 
she was out. 
</P>
<P>
Hanna and Barbera tried to console her with letters and flowers, promising that 
she would continue to play Judy in all other Jetsons projects. 
</P>

OUTTAKES: FRENCH CONNECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"I felt everybody around town looking for ideas, so I looked to some movies I 
loved." 
</P>
<P>
That's how French producer Frederic Golchan made deals on five remakes of 
French films that are now in development or awaiting release at Hollywood 
studios. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, for Warner Bros.' "Quick Change," due out July 13, it was the book 
Golchan loved. The new movie stars Bill Murray, Randy Quaid and Geena Davis as 
three bank robbers trying against all odds to reach the airport and get out of 
town. Although it's the second adaptation of Jay Cronley's 1981 novel -- first 
adapted as "Hold Up," a 1987 French/Canadian production -- Golchan insists his 
is the first version true to the book and its "inherent American humor." 
</P>
<P>
Golchan's other remake projects: 
</P>
<P>
* "The Associate" ("L'Associe," 1979), about an unassuming businessman who 
"invents" a prestigious partner who becomes so popular that the businessman 
sets out to "kill" him. Later, he's arrested for murder. At 20th Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
* "Hibernatus," originally made in 1969 by Edouard Molinaro (same title), about 
a young man who reawakens after 80 years in ice. David Misch is scripting for 
Disney. 
</P>
<P>
* "Things of Life" ("Les Choses de la Vie," 1969), a drama about a man whose 
life flashes before him -- in the moments before he dies in a fatal car crash. 
David Rayfiel scripts or Jaffe-Lansing Prods. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Woman Next Door" ("La Femme d'a Cote," 1981, directed by Francois 
Truffaut), a tale of obsessive love was at Columbia, is now in turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
Golchan has several original projects cooking as well, but he's making his mark 
by retooling French titles for American audiences. The secret? Americans, he 
says, "seem to need their own pacing and format, along with their own language. 
And of course, Americans like movies to be plot-oriented, as opposed to 
character-oriented." Pat H. Broeske

STARTED in 1920 and completed in the '40s, the adobe house at Orcutt Ranch is 
now a popular site for weddings. But it's the small botanical garden -- eight 
acres of an eclectic mix of monkey puzzle, bamboo, huge ancient live oak (one 
is 700 years old, another a teen-ager of 350) and sycamore trees, winding 
paths, a creek, stone otter gargoyles and a grassy picnic area -- that's the 
real treat. Historical tours are conducted on the last Sunday of each month 
between 2 and 5 p.m.

STAGE WEEK: 'STRUGGLING TRUTHS' IN TIBET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Things get cerebral this week at the Odyssey Theatre, where Ron Sossi is 
staging the premiere of Peter Mellencamp's "Struggling Truths," opening 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a think piece," admitted the theater's artistic director. The setting is 
Tibet, spanning the 1930s to 1950s. In a succession of 40 scenes, a 
"reincarnated, enlightened" lama narrates the stories of a brother and sister 
who end up on opposing factions -- he wants to be a lama, she joins the Chinese 
communists -- and of the Dalai Lama taking the throne as a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
As a historical evocation, Sossi allowed, "It has certain information -- but 
since the man and woman are totally fictitious, it's really a condensation of 
what happened." 
</P>
<P>
The basic premise, he continued, "is the clash between the ideas of Tibetan 
Buddhism and Chinese Communism. That's the political level. But on the 
metaphysical level, there's the whole idea of duality: that we live our lives 
under the illusion that everything breaks down into opposites -- things are 
good or bad, black or white. In the philosophical sense, it's about how we're 
caught, always choosing between those opposites. Therein lies our state of 
suffering, the Buddhists say." 
</P>
<P>
Although Sossi stressed that the playwright does not side with either the 
Buddhist or Communist point of view, the piece is nevertheless provocative; one 
Asian actor turned down a role because, he said, he didn't like the play's 
politics. Which leads to another issue: the director has heard rumors of 
discontent about the relatively small number of Asian actors (three out of 14) 
cast in the piece. 
</P>
<P>
"It was never intended by the writer to be all-Asian," he said 
matter-of-factly. "It's a parable, not a historical document. I definitely 
wanted to do it cross-culturally; that's how we advertised. We wanted to use as 
many Asians as possible, and we went out of our way to look for them. The long 
and short of it is, the Asian community of actors is not that large, so our 
choices were very small. Some of the Asian actors we cast later withdrew. 
Others we found didn't even come in to audition." 
</P>
<P>
THEATER BUZZ: Speaking of the Odyssey, we were wondering what was going on with 
that "one- year" lease signed with the city last August. The theater doesn't 
show any signs of picking up and moving on any time soon. "Originally they told 
us, 'We can only give you a one-year lease, but the way the city operates, 
it'll probably be two or three years -- at least,' " said Sossi. "At the same 
time, (Councilman Zev) Yaroslavsky said, 'Don't hold your breath; anything can 
happen.' So that's where we are."

ON THE RECORD: THE QUARTET SCENE, EAST AND WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
String quartets were once classified according to certain perceived national 
characteristics. The typical American group (forget about the melting pot) was 
a tough bunch whose work was predicated on drive and hard edges. East European 
ensembles were purveyors of a lush, rhythmically free style. Britons were 
undemonstrative, etc. 
</P>
<P>
While once there may have been some validity in such simplifications, the 
listener unfamiliar with the performers' names in recent chamber music 
recordings would be unlikely to determine their national origins. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's Lindsay String Quartet brings a powerful ensemble personality to 
three Haydn quartets: in F minor, Opus 20, No. 5; in B-flat, Opus 33, No. 4, 
and in D, Opus 71, No. 2, all recorded live at London's premier chamber music 
venue, the Wigmore Hall (ASV 674). These are aggressive but hardly slapdash 
readings. The Lindsay is attentive to modern scholarship in matters of 
Classical articulation without totally forswearing the use of expressive 
portamento. 
</P>
<P>
And if Czech ensembles are inevitably fat-toned purveyors of Romanticism, then 
what is the Panocha Quartet doing playing the first four of Haydn's magical 
Opus 33 quartets (Supraphon 0634, mid-price) with such short-stroke lightness, 
such zippy incisiveness and elegant wit? The question is rhetorical. 
</P>
<P>
From Hungary comes the New Budapest Quartet, a daring name if ever there was 
one, with what would seem to be its debut recording (Hyperion 66401). While 
these gentlemen may not efface memories of the Budapest Quartet, the present 
group has a claim to authenticity denied their illustrious predecessor: the old 
Budapest in its final and finest configuration comprised four Russian-born 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The "New" group presents the first two quartets of Beethoven's Opus 18 in 
finely tuned, sweet-toned readings that miss some of the edginess and 
presentiments of later-Beethoven danger lurking in both scores. Perhaps one 
could summon more enthusiasm for their playing if we were offered something 
more necessary than this first installment of yet another Beethoven cycle. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of the 20th CD version of Schubert's "Death and the Maiden" (MCA 
25899) didn't rouse the passions, either. Still, the New World String Quartet, 
Harvard University's first quartet in residence, demands attention, responding 
with undeniable skill and flair to the familiar measures. 
</P>
<P>
The New World, as captured in MCA's attractively intimate sonics, has a big, 
warm ensemble tone joined to a driving style that moves the music along smartly 
but with no feeling of haste. The coupling finds the New World illuminating 
much earlier, but hardly negligible, Schubert, his Quartet in G minor, D. 173. 
</P>
<P>
If a Russian school of quartet playing still exists, its vestiges reside in 
Moscow's venerable, venerated Borodin Quartet. While its kind of grand manner 
is sorely missed in some repertory, the Borodin's big-toned, emotionally 
generous style is as ill-suited to the flickering half-lights of the Debussy 
and Ravel Quartets as is the over-resonant recording (Virgin Classics 91077). 
</P>
<P>
London's hot-ticket Arditti String Quartet, which specializes in 20th-Century 
scores -- consider them a Kronos Quartet without the props, funky threads and 
carefully cultivated mystique -- has begun what promises to be an exciting 
series for the French Disques Montaigne label. The initial release (without 
catalogue number) pairs the two works in the medium by Alban Berg: the String 
Quartet, Opus 3, and the "Lyric Suite." 
</P>
<P>
The interpretations blaze with conviction and skill, without quite capturing 
the off-kilter lyricism of what some take to be the ironic title of the Suite. 
Still, it would be foolish to argue with such technical mastery, or with the 
solidity of tone these artists bring to music that is often encountered as a 
succession of frenetic scrapes and scratches, distancing us from the score's 
elusive emotional core. 
</P>
<P>
The Artaria Quartet, while taking its name from the old Viennese publisher of 
chamber music, hails from San Francisco, where its members are principals of 
the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra. The foursome presents on period instruments 
three of Boccherini's six quintets for strings with guitar obbligato (Richard 
Savino), including the irresistible G-major Quintet, with its stomping Fandango 
finale (Harmonia Mundi 9007026). 
</P>
<P>
The playing combines sweetness of tone and rhythmic punch, with Elisabeth Le 
Guin meriting particular praise for her skillful execution of the tortuous, 
high-lying cello parts.

The young ex-Art Blakey pianist seems to want to touch all bases, at the cost 
of a truly distinctive style: "See-See Rider" is an old time Ma Rainey blues; 
others are works by Monk, Elmo Hope (the very boppish "Crazy") and Neal Hefti 
(a long investigation of "Li'l Darlin' "). Green's four originals are 
lightweight and pleasant, but his attempt to re-create Bud Powell's "Glass 
Enclosure" lacks the dynamic articulation of the composer's own 1953 
masterpiece. A promising though less than consistent major label solo debut.

In-Effect. Bad Brains, Living Colour, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Fishbone are 
some of the bands in these Bronx bombers' ballpark, but the Spyz announce their 
ultimate fealty early in their second album, with "Purple Haze" guitar quotes 
that fly the Hendrix flag high. 
</P>
<P>
"Gumbo Millenium" sounds more like an indulgent, late-career album than the 
unmistakable statement of intent you want in a young group's second round. Some 
crushing metal cuts, inventive jazz-rock hybrids and touching soulfulness are 
obscured by uninspired filler and especially by plain ol' goofing off that 
should never have been let out of the studio. RICHARD CROMELIN

On his major-label debut, the son of minor-league blues man Tabby Thomas 
concocts a strange brew of deep soul, country blues, modern funk, Hendrix and 
Marley that falls somewhere between a more rockin' Robert Cray and a Lenny 
Kravitz without the Lennonisms. Despite a pro forma approach to songwriting and 
a somewhat limited vocal palette, young Thomas gets by on the depth of his 
emotional expression and a stinging, rootsy guitar style. An audience for this 
amalgam awaits. DON WALLER

POP EYE: THE CD LONG BOX: VICTIM OR VILLAIN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is it time to put the CD long box on the endangered species list? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it's too early to predict the demise of the unpopular -- and unwieldy -- 
long box, which has become an industry-wide eco-embarrassment. But long-box 
opponents are on the offensive: 
</P>
<P>
* Saying he's received thousands of letters from outraged consumers, Ban the 
Box founder Robert Simonds, who runs Rykodisc Records, is touting a plan 
encouraging record buyers to remove long boxes and leave empty cartons with 
register clerks at local record stores. 
</P>
<P>
* The Ban the Box coalition has received "pledges of support" from dozens of 
new rock star partisans, including David Byrne, the B-52's, the Replacements' 
Paul Westerberg, 10,000 Maniacs, John Hiatt, Rosanne Cash, Crosby, Stills &amp; 
Nash and Lenny Kravitz. 
</P>
<P>
* Perhaps the most encouraging news is that long-box printer and paper 
manufacturers are feeling so much pressure that they've begun a lobbying 
counter-offensive. Worried that record labels are considering plans to junk the 
boxes, paper and printing companies have formed the Entertainment Packaging 
Assn. (EPA), which recently gave record execs a three-page fact sheet designed 
to promote the long box's positive attributes. 
</P>
<P>
(Among its claims, the fact sheet says that long boxes are "environmentally 
friendly"; that it is a "myth" that American forests are "being abused" like 
Brazilian rain forests and that eliminating CD packaging, which constitutes 
"less than .00006 of the weight of all garbage produced annually in the U.S.," 
would extend the life of a landfill "by less than one hour every year.") 
</P>
<P>
"We think the (long-box) has been unjustly maligned," says Floyd Glinert, EPA 
head and executive vice president of Shorewood Packaging, a leading New 
York-based paper-printing firm. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a lot of overkill on this whole issue -- it's become almost 
unpatriotic to say you're not in favor of recycling. So after all the coverage 
during Earth Day, we felt that our side of the story wasn't being told. The 
bottom line is that long boxes represent an infinitesimal percentage of the 
solid-waste garbage in this country." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tower Records chief Russ Solomon -- who in April dismissed 
environmental concerns, saying he was "adamantly opposed" to ditching the long 
box -- is changing his tune. While he still insists that long boxes are "the 
industry's most practical packaging tool," the owner of the influential 
55-store chain now boasts that clerks at Tower's L.A. and Seattle stores are 
encouraging consumers to leave long-box trash at the cash registers. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a tremendous positive response," said the shift manager at Tower's 
Sunset Strip store. "We're unloading 40 to 50 20-gallon bags full of long boxes 
every day, which we're sending to a recycling center in Santa Monica. I'd say 
that nearly 75% of the customers are leaving their long boxes. And most people 
who don't are buying CDs as gifts." 
</P>
<P>
Tower stores will also soon offer consumers the choice between bags made out of 
recyclable plastic or paper. Is it possible Solomon has suddenly made the leap 
onto rock's eco-bandwagon? "I guess I'm more open-minded than I was a few 
months ago," he said. "We live in the real world and I listen to what people 
say -- and they're saying we have to be more ecology conscious. Even my own 
store clerks have been bitching at me and writing me nasty letters!" 
</P>
<P>
Ban the Box's Simonds is hoping his eco-offensive will encourage other record 
store owners to see the light. "It's a dramatic method for consumers to show 
retailers where they stand on CD packaging -- and transfer some of the 
consequences of the long box to record store owners," said Simonds, who began 
his campaign earlier this year. "It's also a way of reminding them that all 
this trash isn't out of sight and out of mind, because the trash is going into 
their dumpsters."

ON THAT SUBJECT: Raffi and Midnight Oil aren't the only pop artists who don't 
want their new CDs released with a long box. According to manager Kenny Laguna, 
rock songstress Joan Jett manager has made a formal request to CBS Records 
asking that the label issue her next album without a CD long box. 
</P>
<P>
"Joan isn't someone who gets involved in a lot of causes, but she feels 
strongly about this -- she doesn't want to be a party to destroying millions of 
trees for a box that everyone throws into the garbage," explained Laguna, who 
said Jett's album is tentatively scheduled for a Christmas release. "So we sent 
a letter to the top execs at CBS about a month ago, along with some recent 
Earth Day articles. Joan made it clear she's serious. She said if they felt 
they couldn't market her CD without a long box, then she'd rather them not put 
a CD out at all, even though that could cost her a lot of record sales." Laguna 
said the CBS brass is currently considering her request.

HILBURN'S DEFENSE OF RAP -- FANS AND FOES REACT; 
</P>
<P>
WHAT ROLE MODELS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If "rap's most important message may not be in the music or words at all, but 
in the establishment of rappers as role models," and even if "what's often 
overlooked in the criticism of the song is that the narrator doesn't follow 
through on the impulse," any group that even has the impulse to "kick the woman 
in the stomach and kill the baby" is sick, deviant and totally pathetic! 
</P>
<P>
Role models? To whom? And to what mentality? To what kind of society are we 
speaking? 
</P>
<P>
The fact of the matter is quite simple, really. This is not music in any 
definition of the word. This is garbage, it's boring and insulting to anyone of 
any intelligence at all! Freedom of speech? Artistic freedom? Don't make us 
laugh! There's no "art" in all this, and as for vindication, we think not. Not 
even time will vindicate such an assault on the senses. 
</P>
<P>
The saddest part of all this is that the rappers are doing to their community 
exactly what the more outrageous members of the gay liberation movement are 
doing to theirs: setting back the "cause" about 20 years. Truly a shame and a 
disservice to all the people in each group who have worked tirelessly to 
promote a positive image and make our world a better place.

HILBURN'S DEFENSE OF RAP -- FANS AND FOES REACT; 
</P>
<P>
MESSAGE UNDERSTOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Robert Hilburn's June 24 commentary, "Getting a Bad Rap," misses the point. His 
mistake is he fails to realize or examine the fact that rap scares parents and 
the mainstream not just by its content but its context. 
</P>
<P>
To say people outside the inner city can't relate to life there because they 
don't experience it isn't the issue. If rap is representative of inner-city 
life, then what is shown is a life that is violent, scary, tough and 
aggressive, even in the positive messages that Hilburn says rap music gives. 
</P>
<P>
By conveying all of this in a confrontational and aggressive posture, rap makes 
the inner-city life even scarier to the mainstream, and thus gentrifies our 
society even more. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of feeling a stronger need to improve life there and understand it 
better, people get scared or put off by it and they build walls to avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
The walls get stronger not because this music is misinterpreted but because it 
is understood. 
</P>
<P>
Confront an audience, in this case the rest of society, with blatant, sexually 
or violently charged views of a tough and hardened life, then make the images 
graphic or explicit, and that audience will not only recoil, it will withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
Right or wrong isn't the point; it's that "getting up in their face" will never 
gain you allies, only fuel your enemies. Hilburn may be able to see the city 
through the fire, but his explanation will not keep it from burning.

HILBURN'S DEFENSE OF RAP -- FANS AND FOES REACT; 
</P>
<P>
NO LACK OF ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is Hilburn living on the same planet that I am? He claims that rap music has 
been relegated to "largely underground status" and receives "scant national 
airplay." I pulled out my latest issue of Rolling Stone and found that several 
of the top spots on the charts were held by rap groups, including M.C. Hammer 
at No. 2 and Public Enemy at No. 6. 
</P>
<P>
I hear rap music utilized constantly in commercial advertisements, public 
service messages and nationally syndicated TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
Wasn't that Run DMC running neck and neck with Woody in the "Tour de Lite" TV 
commercial? How about the Lakers' "Just Say No to Drugs!" video a couple 
seasons back? And who could forget that god-awful "We Are the Bears," which 
showcased the rapping abilities of Jim McMahon and William (The Refrigerator) 
Perry? Didn't Theo Huxtable perform a rap song on the nation's No. 1 TV show? 
Heck, rap even has its own TV show, "Yo! MTV Raps!" 
</P>
<P>
I have had the opportunity to teach both in the inner city (South-Central Los 
Angeles) and a rural environment. From what I can tell, kids everywhere can't 
get enough rap music. If they could memorize their times tables as well as they 
memorize rap lyrics, my job would be cake. 
</P>
<P>
Hilburn's theory that rap's message is lost on white, middle-class, 
college-educated "observers" because it employs literary devices from the 
inner-city culture borders on racism. Could you imagine someone getting away 
with saying the reverse? That black, inner-city "observers" were confused over 
the message of another musical genre because it utilized literary devices 
foreign to their dialect? Come on, Robert, give us some credit. 
</P>
<P>
Hilburn is getting farther and farther out of touch. Having him write a rap 
overview is like having James Watt write the Sierra Club newsletter. I just 
don't think he gets it.

HILBURN'S DEFENSE OF RAP -- FANS AND FOES REACT; 
</P>
<P>
IT NEEDS NO DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mr. Hilburn, your defense of rap is admirable, but if your chief desire for rap 
is to produce a white artist of "Elvis-like talent and charisma who could 
translate the energy and style of rap in a way that might neutralize the issue 
of race," then we can do without your defense. 
</P>
<P>
What you want is what WASP culture seems to perpetuate throughout modern 
history, that is, the co-opting of African cultural creativity, taking out 
overtly ethnic uniqueness, adding some arrogant European refinement (to make it 
palatable to the so-called civilizers of the land), and voila: Rap music devoid 
of all the anguish, frustration and disillusionment that produced it in the 
first place! 
</P>
<P>
Rap is the musical equivalent of the voice of Abel's blood crying from the 
ground. It is the expression of both pride and protest of African-American 
youth. Rap music cries out from the wilderness to remind America that a good 
part of the wealth of this nation was, and continues to be, built on the 
deprivation and degradation of the African, and, though we labor in the midst 
of economic and cultural disrespect, rap affirms the dignity of our African 
heritage and serves as the voice of dissent in the land. 
</P>
<P>
The violent image of rap artists, reflected in some of their dress and lyrical 
content, speaks to the fact that 400 years of forced labor is violent! The 
psychological damage of decades of social stigmatization through segregation is 
violent! The defamation of our character as a people through media and the 
educational system's intentional suppression of our many cultural contributions 
to America is violent! This violence is the fruit from the ground that white 
America's Manifest Destiny has sown. 
</P>
<P>
The illusion of WASP greatness has infected most of the white population with a 
self-induced insanity that prevents a realistic self-appraisal in establishing 
the causes of racial turmoil in this country. As a result, any effort that 
speaks of our dissatisfaction over our forced social and economic peonage -- be 
it through music, film or the written word -- the so-called mainstream response 
is always the same: Will it promote bloodshed? Any perceived threat that rap 
produces in white communities is based solely on the guilt of ill-gotten gain 
and the fear of rebellion and revenge, as well as the steadily growing 
popularity of rap among white youth. 
</P>
<P>
Lastly, Hilburn's statement that rap's most important message may not be in the 
music or words at all is to insult the very issue rap music brings to the 
forefront. Rap stands on its own merit and needs no defense. Without the 
message and words, there's no point to rap. Take it or leave it.

CHURCHILL GRANDCHILDREN CAN'T ESCAPE THE SHADOW OF GIANT; 
</P>
<P>
HISTORY: NONE OF THE 10 MEN AND WOMEN OF SCANT ACCOMPLISHMENT THREATENS TO 
MATCH SIR WINSTON'S STATURE AS A STATESMAN, ORATOR AND HISTORIAN.

<TEXT>
<P>
Hurrying back to London after a weekend in the country, Winston Churchill 
ignored the pleas of his grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't go, Grandpa," begged Edwina Sandys and young Winston Churchill, who were 
staying at Chequers, the prime minister's official country residence. 
</P>
<P>
It was July, 1944, a month after the D-day invasion, the early days of the 
German V-1 "buzz bomb" assault on London. 
</P>
<P>
As the car drew away, his secretary, Marion Spicer, recorded in his diary that 
the war and the youngsters both weighed on Churchill's mind. 
</P>
<P>
"What a world to bring children into!" the prime minister said. 
</P>
<P>
The world has proven hospitable for the 10 grandchildren of Sir Winston Leonard 
Spencer Churchill (1874-1965). It's a place where they can make their marks, 
but they can't escape his long shadow. 
</P>
<P>
Three have made it into "Who's Who," including two who have followed their 
grandfather and their fathers into Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Winston S. Churchill and Nicholas Soames are Conservative Party back-benchers 
-- legislative spear carriers -- in the House of Commons where 50 years ago 
their grandfather summoned Britain to a sacrifice of "blood, toil, tears and 
sweat." 
</P>
<P>
In a studio on Long Island, Edwina Sandys is hacking away at pieces of the 
Berlin Wall to create a sculpture for Westminster College in Fulton, Mo., where 
Churchill warned the West in 1946 that "an iron curtain has descended across 
the continent." 
</P>
<P>
The third generation also includes businessmen, a barrister and a society 
journalist. None, as yet, threatens to match their grandfather's eminence as a 
statesman, orator, historian and artist. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have his ability, and I know it," says Nicholas Soames, who was 
elected to the House of Commons in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 42. When he was that age, he had already been chancellor of the Exchequer. 
I haven't yet gotten off the back benches." 
</P>
<P>
Soames, a pal of Prince Charles, has his grandfather's round face and 
monumental physique -- "portly, flamboyant, fun," in the words of Matthew 
Parris, political satirist for The Times of London. 
</P>
<P>
With some affection, the opposition lawmaker Tony Banks has said that "anyone 
who sees the honorable member for Crawley here on a Friday in his weekend 
clothes cannot but think instantly of Mr. Toad." 
</P>
<P>
The grandfather, too, spent long years as just another member of Parliament 
between 1929 and 1940 -- a lonely voice urging Britain to face up to the 
monstrousness of Adolf Hitler's Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"People glibly talk of his finest hour, and most people would have in mind 1940 
and the ensuing wartime years," says the younger Winston Churchill. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . I think the real trial for him had been the 1930s, when he could count 
his political friends on the fingers of one hand, when he was being reviled in 
the press, on the radio, in Parliament." 
</P>
<P>
The grandson is not friendless, but has been a back-bench exile since 1978 when 
he defied Conservative Party head Margaret Thatcher, then the opposition 
leader, by voting to end sanctions against the white-minority government of 
Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't see it as wilderness years, because unlike my grandfather I'm 
actually supportive of the government that's in power, my own party. He was 
not," Churchill said recently. 
</P>
<P>
Churchill, 49, has made his way quietly and surely, unlike his combative 
father, Randolph, the only son among the five children of Winston and 
Clementine Churchill. Randolph Churchill, who died in 1968, was elected to the 
House of Commons only because he once ran unopposed, and he was once dismissed 
by a newspaper columnist as "the pale satellite of another's fame." 
</P>
<P>
Randolph Churchill was married and divorced twice. Arabella Churchill McLeod, 
the child of his second marriage, lives in western England and directs 
"Children's World," a theater project for handicapped children. 
</P>
<P>
His sister, Diana Churchill, who committed suicide in 1965, had three children 
by her marriage to the late Duncan Sandys -- Julian Sandys, a barrister; Celia 
Sandys Perkins, an interior decorator who lives in Devon, and Edwina, who lives 
in New York with her husband, Richard Kaplan. 
</P>
<P>
Another sister, Mary Churchill, now Lady Soames and the only surviving child of 
Sir Winston, had five children by her marriage to the late Christopher Soames 
-- Nicholas; Emma Soames, former editor of "The Tatler"; Charlotte, now Lady 
Peel by virtue of her marriage to Earl Peel; Jeremy Soames, an executive with 
the banking house of N. M. Rothschild; and Rupert Soames, chairman of GPTelecom 
in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Sir Winston's actress-daughter, Sarah, died in 1983, leaving no survivors. A 
fifth child, Marigold, died in childhood. 
</P>
<P>
The stresses reflected in the lives of Churchill's children have been less 
severe for the grandchildren, says Emma Soames. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we're a generation on does make it a lot easier," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Her brother says family connections are resented by a newer breed of Tory, cut 
in the mold of Margaret Thatcher, the grocer's daughter. "Contrary to what 
Americans think," Soames says, "this isn't a country that is run as a 
hereditary democracy.' 
</P>
<P>
Young Winston Churchill found the name could be a burden. In "Memories and 
Adventures," published last year, he told of being thrashed by bullies at Eton, 
who would taunt him, "Take this for being a -- -- ! Take this for being a -- -- 
! And take this for being Winston-bloody-Churchill!" 
</P>
<P>
Born at Chequers, Churchill has most closely followed his grandfather's 
footsteps. Both toured Africa, and wrote books about it. Both were war 
correspondents, the grandfather in the Boer War and the grandson in Vietnam and 
the Middle East. Sir Winston entered Parliament at age 26, his grandson at 30. 
</P>
<P>
Emma Soames also took up journalism, and at one time had Randolph Churchill's 
old job of writing a column for the Evening Standard. She giggles, proudly, 
about being the first woman journalist labeled a "hackette" by Private Eye, 
London's bitingly satirical magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen months ago she was appointed editor of Tatler magazine. From its bare 
and utilitarian offices she chronicled the world of "power, money, glamour, 
style, wit, success. You know -- up!" 
</P>
<P>
Though born into that world, she says that being Winston Churchill's grandchild 
counts for little in today's equation of power and success. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure it opened a few doors," she said. "But the doors get slammed in your 
face again if you don't deliver the goods. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after the interview with The Associated Press, Soames was fired and 
the Conde Nast firm appointed a new editor to attempt to revive the magazine's 
flagging circulation. 
</P>
<P>
As a child, Emma Soames lived at Chartwell Farm, near Churchill's personal 
country home, Chartwell, in the woodlands of Kent, and often saw her 
grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose I must have been 4 or 5, so it's a bit hazy. But I remember him 
using words that I didn't understand, and I used to go to my nanny and say, 
'What does inappropriate mean?' " 
</P>
<P>
Edwina Sandys says the Berlin Wall work is her first directly inspired by her 
grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
"It's silly to be too purist about it," she said in a telephone interview. "But 
he was such a famous man. You don't want always to do something connected with 
him, you want your own thing." 
</P>
<P>
However, she and her sister prepared an exhibition of her grandfather's 
watercolors in Washington in 1983, a tribute to happy days at Churchill's 
country home. 
</P>
<P>
"He would be painting, and sometimes we would show our drawings," she said. "He 
was doing more painting than we were. 
</P>
<P>
"He loved color, he loved landscape and was very, very sensitive. Some of the 
landscapes he did show enormous sensitivity to light, light on trees and light 
on water and clouds, which perhaps some people wouldn't realize he had." 
</P>
<P>
Edwina Sandys got a taste of fame from "Christa," a statue of a crucified woman 
that was condemned by an Episcopal bishop when it was displayed at New York's 
Cathedral of St. John the Divine in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"People write to me all the time about Christa, and they want photographs and 
posters and things," she said. The image is now on loan in California. 
</P>
<P>
"She's sort of out on her own, you know, like a child that's grown up," said 
Sandys, who has two grown sons. "She goes out and gets invited to places." 
</P>
<P>
Young Winston Churchill says he was influenced a lot by his father and his 
grandfather, "particularly in the causes I've inherited." 
</P>
<P>
He campaigned for a memorial to victims of the Katyn Forest massacre in Poland, 
carried out by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, and co-founded Radio Free Kabul on 
behalf of the moujahedeen fighting the Communist government and the Soviet army 
in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
And, a few months short of his 50th birthday, Churchill says he is still in the 
younger half of the House of Commons. 
</P>
<P>
During the turbulent 1960s and '70s, his Churchillian views on defense and 
foreign policy, expounded in his book "Defending the West," found an opponent 
in his half sister, Arabella. She supported disarmament, he says, and was very 
much "opting for the alternative lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Navy once made the mistake of inviting her to be the Azalea Queen at 
the rendezvous of the NATO navies at Norfolk, Va., and made the mistake of 
sending her a reply-paid telegram," Churchill says. 
</P>
<P>
"They got back about six pages of diatribe against this iniquitous warmongering 
organization called NATO, even though it was her grandfather who was largely 
responsible for creating it." 
</P>
<P>
Now, at least, he laughs heartily at the story.

DIPLOMACY: WOULD-BE BENEFACTORS ARE AMONG THE THRONGS FLOCKING TO THE NEW

<P>
Poland is awash in would-be benefactors. Executives, ambassadors, governors, 
heads of state, celebrities -- the parade of visitors trailing their good 
intentions through the country's wrecked economy is endless. 
</P>
<P>
The goodwill visits have become tiring, but Poland must try to cash in on the 
bonanza before the angels from the West turn to another fashionable cause. 
</P>
<P>
For every planeload of visitors, ranking government members must clear 
schedules and prepare briefings. They fear closing off any opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
But now, although very politely, some Poles are beginning to wonder: Will much 
of anything come of all the meetings, briefings and conferences? 
</P>
<P>
"The Poles are suffering from visitor fatigue," said Jerzy Gabrielczyk, a 
London businessman working as a top adviser to the Industry Ministry through 
the British Know-How aid fund. 
</P>
<P>
"They come and have meetings with the ministers. They think it is fantastic -- 
to have a meeting with a minister. Then they shake hands and nothing ever 
happens," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some missions have been fruitful: A German builder has started a new airport 
terminal, and a French firm provided computer services for the May municipal 
elections. The well-publicized homecoming of heiress Barbara Piesecka Johnson 
brought a monumental art exhibit, but talks on investing in the Gdansk shipyard 
broke off. 
</P>
<P>
The visits can mark the beginning of genuine cooperation, said Jerzy Baczynski, 
writing in the weekly Polityka. 
</P>
<P>
"Yet on many occasions . . . their only outcome are suggestions on further aid 
to Poland" -- subject to further study, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The foreign delegations are political, parliamentary, industrial, international 
-- and countless. 
</P>
<P>
A small sampling from recent weeks: Portuguese business leaders, Japanese 
investors, the U.S. Import-Export bank, India's health minister, Iran's vice 
minister of building, Britain's foreign minister, Sweden's minister for 
cooperation with developing countries, East Germany's defense minister, former 
U.S. national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, French police officers and 
the governor of Maryland -- along with his state's topsail schooner, the Pride 
of Baltimore II. 
</P>
<P>
They come to teach: how to speak English, run a democratic election, organize a 
free press. And to learn: How bad are the telephones? How much would it cost to 
retool a factory? 
</P>
<P>
The new Polish government hopes they have also come to give: harvesters for 
farmers, computers for banks and money to help the nation's young market 
economy grow. 
</P>
<P>
But some, it seems, mainly come for what photographers call a "grip and grin" 
with Poland's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat regularly required to arrange visits senses a new 
ambivalence among Polish officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It is ambivalence because intellectually even some very impatient people 
realize they are getting pretty generous aid packages from most of the West, 
and it is in their interests to be a good trooper," the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, we have noticed a growing impatience with this constant flow of 
visitors," he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Schurick, Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer's press secretary, said he 
felt it. 
</P>
<P>
"That notion was in the air . . . that they've seen a lot of foreign 
delegations here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the governor is convinced that a personal visit is worthwhile if it comes 
with an all-business message, said Schurick: "We've got no intention to solve 
Poland's problems but if there can be two or three specific contracts with 
Maryland, then I'm going to do what I can to make them happen. . . . A personal 
visit could put it over the top." 
</P>
<P>
Polish officials are reluctant to talk about the downside of being so 
sought-after. 
</P>
<P>
One with a well-known name, whose portfolio includes pressing economic issues, 
was overheard by a diplomat asking with a tinge of annoyance when faced with a 
new visitor, "What am I, the minister of tourism?" 
</P>
<P>
Polish leaders have developed A lists and B lists of meeters and greeters 
according to a visitor's rank, the Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone wants to see (Solidarity Parliament leader Bronislaw) Geremek, 
everyone wants to see (Lech) Walesa. But just because everyone wants to come to 
Poland, it doesn't mean that they can see them," said another Western diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, the architect of Poland's economic reform 
plan, is one of those in "huge demand," said an aide. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all there are the politicians who come here out of curiosity," he 
said. "And of course all the ambassadors are pushing their way in through doors 
and windows. We decided Thursdays would be the day for them, so we see a 
maximum of two every Thursday." 
</P>
<P>
Then there are business executives, the aide said. "There is great danger that 
one could be granted a meeting and another wouldn't be, so we are really trying 
to limit them. . . . Of course, we have to make exceptions for really big 
figures, such as the head of the (West German) Dresdner Bank." 
</P>
<P>
At the Labor Ministry, Director General Leslaw Nawacki said many visits "have 
the nature of reconnaissance. People just come to see what we are doing or what 
kind of help they could offer." 
</P>
<P>
"The main cost of these visits is hard work and time," he said. "People who 
come often can't really understand the situation in Poland, going from 
socialism to a market economy. Nobody has done it before, and everybody who 
comes here looks at it from the point of view of the West. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, we must admit with shame that we are not prepared either. 
It's something completely new to most of us."

OBSCURE GROUP CLAIMS TO TARGET PHILIPPINES; 
</P>
<P>

TO OVERTHROW THE AQUINO REGIME. BUT ITS EXISTENCE IS DOUBTED.

<P>
A shadowy group of young military officers, using anti-American rhetoric, 
claims to lead an underground movement to overthrow President Corazon Aquino 
and the social system she represents. 
</P>
<P>
The Young Officers Union, or YOU, appeared last year as yet another clique in 
the factionalized Armed Forces of the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of YOU's membership within the 15,000-member officer corps -- or 
even whether the organization exists at all beyond press releases -- is the 
subject of considerable speculation among government officials, the press and 
foreign diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos dismisses YOU as a public relations creation of 
the better-known Reform the Armed Forces Movement, whose image has been 
tarnished because of links to discredited politicians. 
</P>
<P>
But some officials apparently take the group seriously; the military has 
offered a total of $77,000 in rewards for the arrest of seven renegade officers 
identified as YOU leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Some military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, estimate that up to 
half the lieutenants and captains in field units are either members or 
supporters of YOU. 
</P>
<P>
Those estimates, if true, raise the specter of continued political instability 
in the Philippines even after Aquino leaves office in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
YOU's origins are as obscure as the organization itself. Sources said it 
emerged as a separate faction after renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio (Gringo) Honasan 
failed in an attempt to overthrow Aquino in August, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Some officers claim YOU also played a major role in last December's bloody coup 
attempt, along with Honasan's Reform the Armed Forces Movement. 
</P>
<P>
Sources said the younger officers broke with Honasan because they felt he and 
other movement leaders were indecisive and too closely allied to opposition 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
Military sources both inside and outside YOU said the new organization was also 
born of frustration among junior officers with fighting the 21-year war against 
communist rebels. 
</P>
<P>
A colonel, speaking on condition of anonymity, said combat experience has 
persuaded many young officers that the real enemy is not the Communist New 
People's Army, but poverty, social oppression, corruption and the government's 
failure to deliver basic services. 
</P>
<P>
"These idealist guys who are out in the field see the difficulties in fighting 
the communist insurgents with very little help from the government and 
corruption in their military leaders," said a general, who also insisted on 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The colonel said charter members of YOU included intelligence officers who 
became sympathetic with some goals of the communists because of their exposure 
to rebel propaganda and deplorable conditions in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
Like the communists, YOU uses nationalistic, anti-American rhetoric. It calls 
for sweeping social, economic and political change and an end to "American 
interference" in this former U.S. colony. 
</P>
<P>
YOU leaders include Capt. Washington Javier, Capt. Rafael Cardeno and Lt. 
Diosdado Valeroso -- all former members of the Philippine Constabulary's 
special anti-communist intelligence command. All are now underground. 
</P>
<P>
According to sources, YOU also has adopted the organizational structure of the 
outlawed Communist Party of the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
One YOU member, who uses the alias 1st Lt. Ruben Sanggalang, said the 
leadership is divided into nine cells of about six members each. 
</P>
<P>
Each cell is led by a political officer who conducts "teach-ins" and is 
responsible for a specific task, such as propaganda or communications, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As in the communist underground, members of one cell usually know only one 
member of any other cell. This enables cells to maintain contact without fear 
that a single arrest could compromise an entire group, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sources say YOU sponsors Marxist-style political discussions among combat units 
and is trying to establish "support groups" among civilians to broaden its 
base. 
</P>
<P>
YOU statements are replete with the same references to "American imperialism" 
and the Aquino "puppet regime" as those of the communists. 
</P>
<P>
"A considerable number of young military officers have come to realize that 
their supreme loyalty is to uphold the dignity, freedom and social justice that 
the Filipino people rightfully deserve," YOU said in a recent statement. 
</P>
<P>
"We vow Cory will not finish her term as an illegitimate president," the 
statement added. "For as long as the majority of our beloved countrymen have to 
suffer the indignity of living in a prostituted sovereignty and sham democracy, 
we vow to continue the struggle that we hope and pray will finally free our 
beloved countrymen from the clutches of the imperialist U.S. government." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the anti-Americanism appears linked to U.S. intervention in the 
December coup attempt, when U.S. F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover for government 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
"We are warning them (Americans) that the next time they meddle, they will find 
themselves trapped in another Vietnam," Sanggalang said.

Mayor Marion Barry said Friday that he will endorse none of the five Democrats 
vying for his job and urged his loyalists to back whatever candidate they 
choose. 
</P>
<P>
"What I've decided to do . . . is not make any public endorsement," Barry told 
about 100 supporters gathered outside the federal courthouse where his drug and 
perjury trial is being held. 
</P>
<P>
"Those (supporters) who feel compelled to move on can do so." 
</P>
<P>
Top city government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the mayor 
realized that his shrinking number of supporters already were making their own 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
"He knows that his organization is already beginning to slip away," said one of 
the mayor's top political advisers. "At this point, he doesn't have much to 
deliver anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Barry refused to rule out the possibility of making an endorsement in the 
future, but said that for now, "I am busy with my trial in the courtroom here." 
</P>
<P>
Barry announced on June 13 that he would not seek a fourth term while battling 
the criminal charges. The 54-year-old mayor has pleaded innocent to 10 
misdemeanor cocaine possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy 
charge and three felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug 
use.

NIGERIAN SEEKS RELIEF FROM CURSE; 
</P>
<P>
AFRICA: SON SAYS HIS MOTHER'S BODY WAS MISHANDLED WHILE BEING FLOWN TO HER 
VILLAGE -- AND THAT CROP FAILURES AND OTHER WOES HAVE FOLLOWED. HE IS SUING THE 
AIRLINE.

<P>
Almost four years after his mother died, Onyebuchim Onyeanusi yearns to give 
her an honorable burial that might lift a curse against him and his family. 
</P>
<P>
The curse, rooted in African tribal beliefs, has been blamed for all sorts of 
woe in his native Nigerian village: dismal yam harvests, a canceled wedding and 
an epidemic that killed chickens, goats and sheep. 
</P>
<P>
The bad things started after his mother was buried in shame, after, he says, 
her body was mishandled and misplaced for eight days while being shipped from 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Because he was responsible for the funeral, Onyeanusi says he was cursed by the 
gods of his native Ibo tribe, as were 98 family members. 
</P>
<P>
Onyeanusi hoped to set things right the Western way: He and the relatives filed 
suit against Pan American World Airways, which shipped her body home. But a 
federal judge ruled against him last month, and his efforts to avenge his 
mother's spirit now hinge on appeals. 
</P>
<P>
"The war is not over," Onyeanusi said. "This was only a battle." 
</P>
<P>
Onyeanusi's saga underscores the challenges of Africans emerging in the modern 
world, but still rooted in traditional beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
It began Oct. 1, 1986, when his mother, Olamma, died of pneumonia while 
visiting Onyeanusi, who lives on visa status with his American wife and their 
four children in Philadelphia. The mother was about 90 when she died, although 
her age was unknown because of uncertain birth records. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am shipped his mother's body while Onyeanusi flew to southeastern Nigeria 
to arrange the funeral. The body was supposed to go to Paris, then home via 
Nigeria Airways. 
</P>
<P>
According to tribal custom, all business stops until the honored person is 
buried. The family bears all expenses, and Onyeanusi pledged the family's 
155-acre plantation to feed the 20,000 villagers who gathered for the feast 
honoring his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe people should rejoice in death. The highest honor you can give 
someone is at death. There is singing, feasting, the shooting of guns," 
Onyeanusi said. 
</P>
<P>
But the villagers waited and waited and waited. Each day for eight days, a 
frustrated and bewildered Onyeanusi made the two-hour drive to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
The funeral tab eventually came to about $24,000. But that was the least of the 
family's problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Videon Funeral Home of Broomall, Pa., embalmed Olamma Onyeanusi's body and 
dressed it in a blue sarong, blue turban and white gloves. She was placed in a 
sheet metal case, which in turn was put into an air tray made of corrugated 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
The body left New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
But a Pan Am memo dated Oct. 20 from the director of cargo at Roissy Airport in 
Paris said: "Shipment received with a crate surrounding the coffin damaged. 
Nigerian Airways refused to accept transfer and we had to call the Pompes 
Funebres (French funeral home) to repair that crate." 
</P>
<P>
When the body arrived in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, the family said it had 
decayed. And somewhere along the line, Olamma Onyeanusi had been wrapped in 
burlap and turned upside down -- tribal taboos that show someone committed 
suicide or was an evil person. 
</P>
<P>
"These are regarded as the greatest abuse to be given a corpse," Onyeanusi 
said. "We knew from the smell the body had spoiled. She was decomposed, 
decaying. The skin was peeling off." 
</P>
<P>
At the funeral, the family burned heavy incense to mask the smell before 
burying her in disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
The family offered sacrifices of yams, money and English wine to appease the 
gods. But tribe members say they have seen the woman's spirit roaming, despite 
placing chains on her grave to hold her down. 
</P>
<P>
"If anything happens, the family is blamed for it," said Onyeanusi. "My mother 
was treated as if she were nothing. My mother is not at peace. She is angry." 
</P>
<P>
One relative, Obioha Onyeanusi, was a prominent farmer, but was ruined by a 
poor harvest of yams, an Ibo delicacy. An epidemic blamed on the curse also 
killed 2,500 chickens, 95 goats and 89 sheep. 
</P>
<P>
The woman's daughter, Nnalu, earned a degree at Cheyney University in 
Pennsylvania and went home in 1986 to marry a man she had known for 10 years. 
But he called off the wedding because of the curse. 
</P>
<P>
Business deals also went sour, the family says. 
</P>
<P>
"It was as if the family had been shunned. Nobody wanted anything to do with 
them," said John Beavers, Onyeanusi's lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
The family sued in 1988 to recover costs for mental anguish, emotional distress 
and breach of contract. But U.S. District Judge Edmund Ludwig threw the case 
out June 13 without saying anything about the curse. 
</P>
<P>
Ludwig ruled that the case was covered by the Warsaw Convention, an 
international treaty that limits liability on shipments to about $18 per pound 
with a maximum damage claim of $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
The treaty also requires that damage claims be filed within 21 days. Onyeanusi 
didn't notify Pan Am for 60 days, so his claim was invalid, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Bracaglia, Pan Am's attorney, denied the airline mishandled the corpse, 
but refused to comment on specific allegations. But, he said: "The issues 
themselves are fascinating." 
</P>
<P>
Onyeanusi has asked the judge to reconsider and, failing that, will seek relief 
from the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes against the grain of not only Nigerian thinking but American thinking 
that human remains are just goods that can be lost like luggage," Beavers said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to prove to an American jury these curses are real. All we 
want to do is convince them the family believes it's true and they've suffered 
consequences," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Onyeanusi, who is about 50, was a captain in the losing Biafran army during 
Nigeria's 1967-70 civil war, Africa's bloodiest tribal conflict, in which 1 
million people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
He left his native village of Uzuakoli and the land of the Ibo, the 
fourth-largest ethnic group in his homeland, to study in America. He earned a 
bachelor's degree at Philadelphia College of Textiles and Science, a master's 
degree at Temple University and a doctorate in vocational education at Temple. 
</P>
<P>
Experts on African beliefs say Onyeanusi might not be able to offset the curse 
even if he wins the appeal. But it's his only chance to regain respect. 
</P>
<P>
"The gravity of a curse like this is such that one lives with it forever," said 
Emeke Akaezuwa, an Ibo who is executive director of the African Academy of 
Arts, Science and Technology in North Brunswick, N.J. "If you lose respect in 
the Ibo culture, no one takes you seriously. You are as good as dead." 
</P>
<P>
Onyeanusi can only ask the gods for mercy. 
</P>
<P>
"If this had been done to us by an individual, my whole tribe would have gone 
to war," Onyeanusi said. "If I win the case, it would be like bringing back 
someone's head. It would prove I'm a warrior, a strong man. It will show the 
gods I have done something against someone who shamed my mother."

GRAND CANYON CONSIDERING CROWD CONTROL

GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Myrna Hillyard remembers the moving experience of sitting alone at the Grand 
Canyon and studying the beauty. But no more. 
</P>
<P>
"It's much harder to be alone here. You can't really have that solitary 
experience which is so special," the elementary school principal says as she 
shepherds a class around the park. 
</P>
<P>
Cars orbit the parking lot in search of a space these days at the Grand Canyon. 
Tourists remain on shuttle buses for fear of losing a seat and postpone dinner 
until 9 p.m. to avoid the long restaurant lines. 
</P>
<P>
As the population in the Southwest has grown and the popularity of 
Disneyland-Las Vegas-Grand Canyon tour packages has surged -- especially among 
foreign tourists -- the Grand Canyon National Park now finds itself inundated 
with visitors, short on staff and facilities, and searching for solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Park officials expect more than 4 million visitors this year -- 33% more than 
just five years ago. The number of visitors has grown faster than at any other 
national park. 
</P>
<P>
But bus service launched in 1974 in response to crowds -- then just 2 million a 
year -- actually has been cut back, its funding sliced from $1.5 million to 
$620,000. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer rangers are available for talks, toilets are cleaned less often and 
roadside plants end up trampled by drivers who give up trying to find a parking 
space. Complaint letters are up. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just not meeting the needs," said park management assistant Chuck Lundy. 
"The demands on our facilities, our restaurants, our campgrounds, or 
transportation, have exceeded the abilities of the park." 
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether park officials may someday be forced to limit visitors to 
the most popular areas, to preserve a memorable experience. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a dilemma. We're pleased people can come and see the Grand Canyon, but 
we're concerned about the quality of the experience," Lundy said. "We think the 
transition from what is expected to occur into what is unacceptable has begun 
to occur." 
</P>
<P>
Plans are in the works for a huge Disneyland-type parking lot away from the 
park, which would be serviced by shuttle buses, Lundy said. 
</P>
<P>
But while officials and some canyon-protection groups fret over the crowds, 
tourists say they have come to expect nothing else at major attractions. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still so special and so wonderful, I'd hate to see them limit it," said 
Myrna Hillyard, the principal from the Ft. Apache Indian Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
"You expect lots of people, and they really haven't bothered us much," Cort 
Lowerison of California, said during a Memorial Day weekend visit. "We just eat 
in the off hours to avoid waiting in line."

POLAND'S RETURN OF CHOCOLATE FIRM TO CAPITALISM HAS A TASTE OF IRONY;

EASTERN EUROPE: CONFECTIONERY OUTLIVES FOUR DECADES OF COMMUNISM.

<P>
The label on a chocolate box makes a metaphor for the troubled tale of postwar 
Poland. 
</P>
<P>
"Formerly E. Wedel," it says in large letters. In tiny print, a footnote adds: 
"22nd of July Confectionery Industry Works." 
</P>
<P>
Three generations of Wedel family labor were erased by Communist fiat in the 
postwar zeal to nationalize private industries. It took four decades to figure 
out that it was all a big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Now that Poland is embracing capitalism once again, the 22nd of July 
Confectionery Industry Works also will be "formerly." The new label is not 
expected to commemorate it. 
</P>
<P>
The chocolate company is to be one of the first five state enterprises offered 
for sale to private investors as post-Communist Poland tries to revitalize a 
crumbling economy. 
</P>
<P>
From the state-owned industries, private companies are to be formed to flourish 
or fail without government subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
First for the auction block are those deemed to have the greatest chance of 
success, and Wedel occupies a special place in Poland as a prewar company that 
still means quality to consumers otherwise awash in shoddy goods. 
</P>
<P>
When the means of production were liberated from the capitalists, it is said 
the workers at Wedel "spontaneously" called for it to be renamed in honor of 
July 22, 1944, when a Soviet-backed committee proclaimed itself the government 
of Poland. 
</P>
<P>
The candy-loving class and Wedel's foreign customers were not impressed. 
</P>
<P>
As the Communist economy staggered through its last years, apparatchiks in the 
confection section finally admitted the blunder. 
</P>
<P>
The Wedel name went back on the packages, with the delicate addition of 
"formerly," and the official name became a postscript. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the national holiday was changed from July 22 to May 3, the date of 
a Polish constitution in 1791. 
</P>
<P>
Andrzej Karbowniczek, who runs the factory, said: "Regardless of political 
changes, we have never been ashamed of the example of a man who achieved very 
good results" in the chocolate business. 
</P>
<P>
That man was Jan Wedel, third-generation capitalist. His grandfather, Karol 
Wedel, opened a Warsaw candy shop in 1851 and the family's fortunes were 
sweetened by the second generation, Emil, who sent his own son, Jan, to Paris 
and London for instruction in chemistry and management. 
</P>
<P>
When Jan returned, the business expanded further. The Wedels opened a Paris 
shop in 1937 and flew the candy to it in their own airplane. 
</P>
<P>
Jan Wedel is remembered with reverence in Warsaw. 
</P>
<P>
"The company was Wedel's 'family,' " the weekly Tygodnik Solidarnosc said. "He 
attended name days, birthdays, weddings; granted loans, helped solve life's 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
Wedel's factory was occupied by the Germans during World War II and partially 
destroyed. Then, says a promotional booklet from the mid-1980s, "the liberation 
of Warsaw began . . . the socialist expansion of the factory." 
</P>
<P>
One day in 1949, the company was nationalized by People's Poland and no longer 
belonged to the Wedel family. 
</P>
<P>
"People close to Mr. Wedel said he was most happy that the old machinery was 
replaced by modern machines," said Karbowniczek, the factory director. 
</P>
<P>
Happy to lose his family's legacy? 
</P>
<P>
Well, Karbowniczek said, Wedel "was a clever man. He did not intend to fight . 
. . because he knew it was . . . useless." 
</P>
<P>
Tygodnik Solidarnosc said that Wedel was allowed to return as a technical 
manager's assistant, but that the factory register shows him leaving after less 
than a year due to "poor health." 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper suggested that the real reason for his departure was harassment 
by Communist Party operatives at the factory. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses often saw Wedel sit for hours on a bench in the park across the 
street, staring at the factory, the paper reported. 
</P>
<P>
In 1950, one Boleslaw W., identified as a candy wrapper, wrote to the Communist 
Party daily Trybuna Ludu: "It has been five years since the factory has been 
reopened by the Polish Communist Party . . . years of comrades' efforts to . . 
. improve production and improve working conditions. Production and the 
existence of the factory itself have now nothing to do with the capitalist 
Wedel and owe everything to the working class. 
</P>
<P>
"Up to this moment, against logic, the factory has been working under the old 
name Wedel. How can it be? How is it possible to export under the capitalist's 
name? Our export production must be our tool of propaganda . . . of production 
of working people, without capitalists." 
</P>
<P>
The name 22nd of July -- 22 Lipca in Polish -- was adopted, whether by 
"spontaneous" demand of workers or by the apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
Karbowniczek said the decision "was not too fortunate. I had a lot of problems 
with foreign trading partners who were asking who that Mr. Lipca was."

The Wedel factory, which has about 3,000 employees, made sweets last year 
valued at 126 billion zlotys, or $13.2 million. Roughly 20% of its production 
was exported, including the trademark Wedel chocolate wafers in round 
blue-and-white boxes.

"Wedel is one of the first enterprises to be privatized because we are one of 
the best," said Jozef Rutkowski, the factory's financial manager. "We belong to 
the group of enterprises that can guarantee to their shareholders that their 
capital will be quickly multiplied." 
</P>
<P>
The company suffered with the decline of Poland's economy. In 1983, under 
martial law, there was not enough foreign currency to buy raw materials and 
chocolate production ceased for the first time in Wedel's history.

$10 MILLION LATER, TRASH-TO-ENERGY PLANT IS STILL JUST TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

"The construction of a privately operated, trash-fired power plant in northern 
San Diego County was approved Tuesday night by the San Marcos City Council 
following 27 hours of debate and testimony over seven nights of hearings. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The plant's developer said construction of the $217-million project would 
begin within weeks and that the plant, promised to be the most advanced in the 
country because of environmental safeguards, could be operating within 2 1/2 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Times, Jan. 31, 1985 
</P>
<P>
"NCRRA (North County Resource Recovery Associates) officials say they hope to 
begin actual construction in the spring, and for the plant to be operating by 
1990." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Times, Dec. 18, 1987 
</P>
<P>
"By a 3-2 vote that reflects continued divisiveness over the controversial 
issue, the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday agreed to enter new negotiations 
with the would-be developer of a trash-to-energy plant in San Marcos." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Times, Jan. 24, 1989 
</P>
<P>
Eight years after the county first talked about building a sophisticated trash 
incinerator next to its San Marcos landfill -- a plant that would recycle some 
of North County's trash, burn much of the rest of it and even generate 
electricity for San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. -- the county is, well, still 
talking about it. 
</P>
<P>
More than $10 million has been spent so far for a project that still exists 
only on paper. The environmental reports, the lawsuits, the correspondence, the 
consultants' studies, the proposed contracts and the financial spread sheets 
take up not just files, but entire file cabinets. Not only have several people 
been put in charge of the project's development, but it has changed between 
entire corporations. 
</P>
<P>
The trash-to-energy plant was supposed to be operating by now, reducing the 
county's urgent need to develop another landfill in North County. It was 
supposed to cost $120 million, according to the first estimates. And it was 
supposed to be a totally private capital venture, with millions of dollars of 
perks and revenue earmarked for the county and the city of San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
But now, at best, construction may begin late this year or early next year for 
just one phase of the project -- a recycling operation that is designed to 
remove between 20% and 25% of the incoming waste as recyclable material. 
</P>
<P>
If the entire project is built -- complete with huge boilers, a 300-foot-high 
smokestack and technology to keep pollution to a minimum, but still measured in 
tons -- it may cost $300 million, some officials say. Maybe more. 
</P>
<P>
And, unlike the first draft of the project, in which the plant was to be 
designed, built and operated solely by a private company, the county is now 
being asked by the developer to accept some of the financial risks of 
maintaining and operating the plant. 
</P>
<P>
Already, the county has agreed to hire a consultant, at a cost of $60,000, to 
help the developer -- Thermo Electron Corp. of Massachusetts -- secure private 
financing for the project. Three other companies that previously were financial 
partners in the project have backed out, citing increasing costs and reluctance 
to spend more money on a project that may never be built. 
</P>
<P>
The extent of the county's direct financial interest in the trash plant is 
still being debated in negotiations that have been continuing, off and on, for 
months behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
Not the least of the project's critics is county Supervisor John MacDonald, in 
whose North County district the plant would operate and who is one of the 
county officials negotiating with the would-be developer. 
</P>
<P>
"Environmental issues aside -- and I can see both points of view -- the 
economics of this plant are very bad for the county," MacDonald said. "Although 
there is a penalty if the developer backs out, the county is still exposed to a 
very costly liability. If the operation is not successful, the county will have 
to pick it up and try to run it, and I don't think we should be in that 
position." 
</P>
<P>
Said MacDonald: "This project started out to be entirely built, operated and 
funded by the private sector. But now it's been wiggled around so the county is 
undertaking some of the financial risks." 
</P>
<P>
Among those is a proposed contractual term that, should new environmental laws 
require the plant to be retrofitted with new air-pollution control equipment, 
the expense of buying and installing that equipment would be borne by the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
Supervisor Brian Bilbray, who represents the southern part of the county and 
sits on the county's negotiating team with MacDonald, enthusiastically endorses 
the North County trash plant and shrugs off the financial concerns as the cost 
of the county tending to its solid-waste disposal crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray says that, although the financial figures were significantly more 
favorable to the county in 1982, when officials first pitched the idea of a 
trash-to-energy plant, the county has little option but to pursue the project. 
</P>
<P>
"The mistake that was made in 1982 was that both the city and county of San 
Diego placed all their bets on one technology -- trash-to-energy -- and they 
abandoned the pursuit of landfills. In '82, trash-to-energy was the 
environmental option. But everyone stopped pursuing landfills as an alternative 
. . . and today, we don't have either." 
</P>
<P>
The existing San Marcos landfill is scheduled to reach capacity next summer, 
unless -- as expected -- the city of San Marcos gives the go-ahead to the 
county to enlarge it, thereby providing several more years of use. Meanwhile, 
the county is trying to decide where to put one or more new landfills in North 
County. The soonest that one could be open is 1994. 
</P>
<P>
Three sites are under consideration by the county Planning Commission -- one in 
Fallbrook, another alongside California 76 in the Pauma Valley and a third near 
Warner Springs -- but all have been criticized for a host of environmental 
concerns, including fear of contaminating ground water beneath the sites. 
</P>
<P>
Bilbray says that North County, because of its aquifers and geology, does not 
easily accommodate landfills and that, if the region is to responsibly deal 
with its own waste, the trash-to-energy plant is its best alternative. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-'80s, many environmentalists urged the adoption of sophisticated 
trash incinerators, saying airborne pollutants were less a risk than those 
posed by landfills, and because landfill sites were becoming increasingly 
difficult to acquire. 
</P>
<P>
County officials at first embraced the trash-to-energy plant as a better 
alternative than landfills, as well as a source of income to the county, 
through the county's share of royalties in the sale of recyclables and the 
generation of electricity. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, SDG&amp;E signed a contract with North County Resource Recovery 
Associates to buy electricity generated by the burning of trash in San Marcos, 
because of the utility's desire at the time to encourage alternative power 
sources and because of the relatively high cost of energy at the time. Since 
then, however, energy costs have decreased and SDG&amp;E will now end up paying 
NCRRA more for electricity than it would if it entered a similar contract 
today, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The county would receive about $20 million a year for its 90% share of the 
electricity revenue -- but, in turn, SDG&amp;E would end up paying nearly three 
times the actual cost of the electricity the plant would produce, based on the 
contract's language. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, because of the delays in building the plant and increasing costs of 
installing pollution-control devices to meet new state standards, the cost of 
the plant has doubled from the initial estimates. Bilbray, however, still 
vouches for the project's viability and blames the increased cost on North 
County municipal politicians and local landowners who have tried to block its 
construction through litigation. 
</P>
<P>
"The very people we're trying to serve in North County are the ones who are 
suing us, and who are being the obstructionists. They're suing us now because 
of the cost of the plant -- but it's been their lawsuits that have pumped up 
the price of the project every day," Bilbray said. "If they don't want this 
plant built, where do they think they're going to handle their waste stream? I 
don't see them coming up with any better answers." 
</P>
<P>
Trash plant critics note that they proposed greater recycling of North County's 
garbage when the trash plant was introduced, but that the county rejected the 
notion of a wholesale recycling operation in its 1985 environmental impact 
report. Why now, critics ask, has the county done an about-face on recycling? 
</P>
<P>
There may be one obvious answer: Thermo Electron has gotten nowhere with the 
project, stymied by lawsuits, the difficulty in finding financing, escalating 
costs and the need to renegotiate its contract with the county. 
</P>
<P>
To get the project off the dime, San Marcos Mayor Lee Thibadeau in February 
suggested that Thermo Electron at least be allowed to build the so-called 
"front-end," or recycling component, of the project. Thermo Electron officials 
agreed with the notion, and, despite criticism from opponents that the 
recycling-only component was simply a maneuver to gain momentum for entire 
project, the county agreed to consider the half-project. 
</P>
<P>
Now, county officials and Thermo Electron are discussing a contract that calls 
just for a recycling project, but both sides agree that, eventually, they want 
an entire trash-to-energy plant built. To that end, an updated draft 
environmental impact report on the project was released by the county Friday, 
opening a 45-day public review and comment period. 
</P>
<P>
"We were at a stalemate, and these (critics) had been saying since Day 1 that 
recycling is the way to go, so let's start off with that," Thibadeau said. "The 
opposition says recycling will put Thermo Electron's foot in the door, but I 
say it's at least an effort to compromise and start addressing the problem of 
solid-waste removal." 
</P>
<P>
Thibadeau has been the most vocal supporter of the trash-to-energy plant, 
having suggested time and again that, if the county doesn't approve the 
project, he will recommend that his city provide landfill space to serve only 
San Marcos and other North County cities -- he names Vista and Oceanside -- 
which have not tried to block the plant's construction in court. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been sued by Carlsbad, Encinitas and Escondido, even though those cities 
are responsible for generating 46% of the trash that goes into the landfill in 
my city," Thibadeau complained. "It would be real easy for me to tell them to 
go to hell, and to go forward with our own landfill and let them deal with 
their trash on their own." 
</P>
<P>
Thermo Electron officials, meanwhile, say they are ready to spend $80 million 
to $90 million to build the recycling component of the project. If construction 
begins by the end of the year, it would be operating within 21 months, said 
Jerry Davis, president of the company's energy systems division. 
</P>
<P>
"But if we're not ready to go by the end of the year," he said, "we'd all 
reevaluate where we are and recontemplate our navels." 
</P>
<P>
The end-of-the-year construction start-up is critical because the company has 
already been assured $185 million in bonds through the California Pollution 
Control Financing Authority. The bonds have already been sold, and the proceeds 
for Thermo Electron's use are being held in escrow. 
</P>
<P>
But some officials worry that if the project is not under way by December, the 
bond funds, which because of their tax advantages are the single most critical 
element of the project's financing, would no longer be available to Thermo 
Electron, thereby dooming the project. 
</P>
<P>
Financing issues aside, the plant would still have to pass muster from the 
county's Air Pollution Control District, which approved the plant's pollution 
control technology five years ago but, because of changes in state law, will 
now have to meet a newer and tougher set of environmental standards. 
</P>
<P>
In particular, California now has ozone standards that are 25% tougher than 
when the trash plant was first approved by the air district, agency spokesman 
Bob Goggin said. The plant is expected to emit about 300 tons of nitrogen 
oxide, a precursor to ozone, every year. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most difficult challenges facing the NCRRA, Goggin said, will be a 
requirement that the company reduce the county's air pollution by 1.2 tons for 
every ton of pollution that escapes from its San Marcos emissions stack. "We've 
been ordered to reduce pollution in San Diego County, so NCRRA will have to 
clean up something else to a greater degree than it pollutes through this 
plant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if they can do that," Goggin said, explaining that the California 
Clean Air Act requires that no new emissions be generated from new or modified 
sources of pollution. "NCRRA will have to do that through offset mitigations. 
It's a very complex issue, but they've hired a very successful consulting firm 
in finding those kinds of offsets." 
</P>
<P>
Project opponents, who note that they've successfully stalled the project so 
far, say they are increasingly confident that the trash-to-energy plant will 
never be built, either because the state's financing assistance will dry up and 
the company will be unable to find other, independent financing once the county 
Board of Supervisors is frightened off by the risks of associating with the 
plant, or because the plant will fail to meet environmental restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Among the still-pending lawsuits against the project are ones that contend that 
the county should have put the entire public works project out to competitive 
bid, that the environmental impact reports are flawed and that the state acted 
illegally in extending its bond financing offer. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Biondo, Carlsbad's city attorney, calls the trash plant "an incredibly 
bad business deal" in addition to being a case of "bad planning, because 
they've put a major industrial use right next to the La Costa residential area, 
and without any regard to regional interests." 
</P>
<P>
Biondo said residents throughout the county should oppose the trash plant 
because the cost of operating and maintaining it -- which will be paid by the 
county, through the fees it charges trash haulers -- will eventually be picked 
up by residents countywide. 
</P>
<P>
"The Board of Supervisors should say this was an OK deal when it was first made 
in 1982, but that things have since changed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors are next expected to publicly discuss the trash plant in 
November -- at the same time they discuss the expansion of the San Marcos 
landfill.

POLITICAL MAP'S CHALLENGE IS TO COLOR IT BY THE NUMBERS; 
</P>
<P>
REDISTRICTING: ENVIRONMENTALISTS, GAYS AND ETHNIC GROUPS ALL HAVE THEIR OWN 
PROPOSALS FOR REDRAWING CITY COUNCIL DISTRICT BOUNDARIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To understand San Diego politics as the City Council uneasily approachesits 
decennial redistricting task, you literally need a map. 
</P>
<P>
With its brightly colored hues of red, yellow, blue and green, an oversized 
11-by-17-inch map prepared by a council-appointed task force has some council 
members either turning or seeing those colors. Indeed, if that map's irregular 
shapes, squiggles and curves, which can boost or destroy careers, are approved, 
you can color some of the council members blue. 
</P>
<P>
But that is only one of many maps floating around City Hall. Unhappy with the 
task force's product, environmentalists have drawn up a counterproposal that, 
by reconfiguring the eight council districts, could reshape the city's 
political future. Gay activists, neighborhood leaders and others have suggested 
stretching a boundary line here or trimming one there to address their 
concerns, and council aides have spent weeks poring over census data in an 
effort to protect their bosses' interests -- and, not coincidentally, their own 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever their ulterior motives, the political cartographers are bound by other 
guidelines from various sources: creating districts of roughly equal population 
with minimal disruption of existing boundaries, making certain that the lines 
do not discriminate against racial or ethnic minorities, respecting natural and 
man-made boundaries such as canyons and highways, and trying to avoid splitting 
communities into two districts. 
</P>
<P>
What has become obvious to almost everyone who has taken marker pen to map, 
however, is that the immutable legal requirements and practical political goals 
are sometimes mutually exclusive. Or, to paraphrase Abraham Lincoln, when it 
comes to redistricting, you can please some of the people all of the time, but 
you can't please all of the people all of the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people are not going to be satisfied," Mayor Maureen O'Connor concedes. 
"In redistricting, that's inevitable. We talk about justice and fairness being 
the goal. The question is, whose justice?" 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of the redistricting board's proposed map characterize it as a fair, 
evenhanded attempt to devise logical council boundaries in the face of the 
multiple goals governing the process. 
</P>
<P>
"This map wasn't drawn to help or hurt either party, homosexuals, developers, 
environmentalists or any other particular point of view," said campaign 
consultant Dan Greenblat, who served on the board. "What we did was look at 
what we had to do and what communities or the council wanted us to do, and then 
try to make the pieces fit together." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents, however, argue that the map is a thinly veiled effort to bolster 
pro-development forces on the council that further divide the city into 
districts of haves and have-nots. The plan, they contend, further concentrates 
low-income neighborhoods -- and thorny crime and drug problems -- in the three 
council districts south of Interstate 8 now represented by Democrats John 
Hartley, Wes Pratt and Bob Filner. 
</P>
<P>
"This map is a cleverly drawn gerrymander that, under the guise of increasing 
minority representation, segregates the city along socioeconomic lines and 
tries to get rid of the most progressive, environmentally conscious members on 
the council," said 8th District Councilman Filner, whose new Burlingame house 
was left outside the district's proposed new boundaries. "It would be a 
disaster for the city." 
</P>
<P>
Monday's council debate is certain to be lively, for nothing strikes so close 
to politicians' self-interest as does the once-a-decade redrawing of district 
boundaries to reflect population shifts. A high-stakes political drama that can 
all but guarantee some officeholders' reelection while endangering the survival 
of others, redistricting holds major implications for programs, budgets and 
minorities' voting rights -- thereby doing much to set San Diego's political 
agenda for the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
"Redistricting will set the stage for the 1990s in San Diego," said political 
consultant David Lewis. "It creates the playing field where everything else 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
The focal point of the controversy is the proposed redistricting map developed 
by the 17-member citizens' advisory board appointed early this year by the 
council and the mayor. Among other things, that map, the result of more than 20 
meetings during the past five months, would create the city's first 
majority-Latino council district, shift more than a dozen neighborhoods from 
their current district to another and leave two council members -- Filner and 
Linda Bernhardt -- outside their districts as a result of their recent or 
planned moves. 
</P>
<P>
One of the panel's major objectives was to rectify the district-to-district 
population imbalances that occurred over the past decade. For example, although 
only about 112,000 people live in Ron Roberts' 2nd District, more than 172,000 
reside in Abbe Wolfsheimer's 1st District in northern San Diego. Two other 
districts, the 5th and 8th, also have grown substantially above the citywide 
average, while the 6th and 7th districts each need to gain about 20,000 
residents to keep pace with the other districts. 
</P>
<P>
If the city's 1.1-million population were divided equally among the eight 
districts, each would include about 136,000 residents. Under the advisory 
board's recommendation, the districts' population would range from about 
131,000 in the 2nd District to the 5th District's 141,000 -- evidence that the 
guidelines used in drawing the district lines do not neatly conform to absolute 
numerical divisions. 
</P>
<P>
An equally important purpose behind the redistricting process is to help settle 
a 1988 federal lawsuit challenging the city's electoral system. Filed on behalf 
of the Chicano Federation of San Diego County, the lawsuit alleged that the 
citywide general election runoffs then used in council races unconstitutionally 
diluted the voting strength of Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Although San Diego voters made that point moot by adopting district-only 
elections in November, 1988, the lawsuit raised another critical issue: the 
contention that past redistricting has "fractured" Latino votes by dividing 
them among multiple districts, thus minimizing minority communities' political 
clout. As proof, Latino activists emphasize that, while three Latinos have 
served on the council, none has ever been elected without first being 
appointed. 
</P>
<P>
Worried about potential federal court intervention, the redistricting panel's 
members settled on creating a Latino-majority district to avert that 
possibility. That goal would be accomplished in the city's southernmost 
district, Filner's 8th, where the addition of Barrio Logan and southern Golden 
Hill to the heavily Latino communities of Logan Heights, San Ysidro and Otay 
Mesa would increase the number of Latino residents from 40.3% to 52.2%. 
</P>
<P>
"For too long, the Hispanic community hasn't had a champion on the council," 
said Jess Haro, the redistricting board's vice chairman and the Chicano 
Federation's former chairman. "This at least would give minority candidates a 
fairer chance to get elected." 
</P>
<P>
Filner says he could be reelected in 1991 despite the changed demographics. But 
in order for him to have that chance, the district's proposed new boundary -- 
which falls about 10 blocks from Filner's new home -- first would have to be 
realigned, a change that could be achieved relatively easily by shifting a 
small slice of the proposed 3rd District into the 8th District. 
</P>
<P>
A more serious concern for Filner deals with the proposed redistricting plan's 
removal of Balboa Park and a major chunk of downtown from his district. If, as 
proposed, those areas are moved into the 2nd District, Filner argues, the 8th 
District representative will be a "less substantial player" on the council 
because of the loss of those high-profile regions. 
</P>
<P>
"They've not only taken me out of my district, but they've made it a far less 
important district," Filner said. "That's no accident." 
</P>
<P>
The redistricting board's most active members included Greenblat, who was 
instrumental in Republican Gloria McColl's victory over Filner in a 1983 
council race; Patricia Meyer, the law partner of Filner's 1987 opponent, 
Michael Aguirre, and Haro, who also was active in Aguirre's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Another major complaint about the proposed new council boundaries has come from 
the Sierra Club and San Diegans for Managed Growth, which argue that the plan 
would create a pro-development bias on the council by concentrating most 
high-growth areas into the 1st and 5th districts. The proposed 5th District, 
for example, would include most of the Interstate 15 corridor in northern San 
Diego, as well as a major portion of Mission Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Such boundaries not only would force one or two council members to bear the 
brunt of volatile growth battles, but also, thanks to district-only elections, 
would enable other council members to support development in the 1st and 5th 
districts with relative impunity, environmentalist argue. District-only races 
insulate politicians from the wrath of voters outside their own districts. 
</P>
<P>
"By isolating growth into (two) districts, the plan . . . protects other 
council members from having to answer for their votes on growth issues," said 
Sierra Club official Alan Sakarias. Members of the citizens' task force note, 
however, that many community leaders from those northern neighborhoods -- 
particularly those along the I-15 corridor -- favored being consolidated into 
the same district, saying that it could enhance planning. 
</P>
<P>
Under the environmentalists' proposal, those high-growth areas would be divided 
among at least four districts, a plan that they argue would increase 
accountability on growth issues. Doing so, however, could dilute the Latino 
constituency in the 8th District, angering some Latino activists who, mindful 
of their community's historical low voter turnout, fear that any such reduction 
would endanger one of the redistricting proposal's major goals. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a voting rights case, not an environmental case," Haro said. "This 
shows a little hypocrisy and elitism on the part of environmentalists. They 
supported district elections because they said they wanted a greater voice for 
communities, but now they're proposing something that does the opposite." 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of which map is examined, the proposed boundaries also leave some 
neighborhood activists distressed over their communities' placement. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing last month, one gay activist labeled the advisory board's plan a 
"homophobic effort . . . to divide and conquer" by splitting most of the city's 
gay population among three districts, rather than consolidating it within a 
single one. Similarly, residents of Rolando, Oak Park and Golden Hill have 
protested the redistricting panel's plan to either change their council 
representation or divide their community between districts. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the loudest complaints have come from Golden Hill, which, with the 
exception of a small corner in the 4th District, now is concentrated in the 8th 
District. The advisory board's plan, however, would evenly divide the community 
between the 3rd and 8th districts. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just going to take the soul out of this neighborhood," said David 
Moore, president of the Golden Hill Neighborhood Assn. "If we're cut right down 
the middle like this, it will destroy our identity as a community." 
</P>
<P>
Other areas that in their entirety or in part would be shifted to new districts 
under the advisory panel's proposal include Rancho Bernardo, Carmel Mountain 
Ranch, Serra Mesa, Logan Heights, Encanto, Chollas View, Middletown, Uptown, 
Burlingame, Hillcrest, East San Diego, Southeast San Diego, downtown, Mission 
Valley and Clairemont. 
</P>
<P>
Similar complaints are heard about the environmentalists' map, which would 
split areas such as Pacific Beach, La Jolla, University City and Scripps Ranch 
between districts. Some residents of the 2nd District, which stretches from 
Point Loma to Balboa Park under the advisory panel's plan, also are displeased 
with the prospect of being converted into what one Ocean Beach leader called a 
"Coppertone District" running primarily along the coast. 
</P>
<P>
Such dilemmas underline the difficulty of simultaneously meeting the mandates, 
wishes and expectations of the courts, community leaders, interest groups and 
politicians in drawing district lines -- complicating the council's effort to 
meet a July 24 deadline in completing the thorny task. 
</P>
<P>
Most council members have said that they see a need for some changes to the 
redistricting committee's work, with those amendments ranging from minor 
tinkering to a complete overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
"I know this would lead to lots of screaming, but it might be that this map is 
so flawed that maybe we ought to go back to square one," Bernhardt said. In 
contrast, Roberts argues that "a few minor adjustments" could remedy most of 
the map's perceived ills. 
</P>
<P>
Even small-scale changes, however, could be problematical, because, as 
Wolfsheimer notes, a shift of any line "touches off a domino effect" altering 
the makeup of other districts. Or, as GOP campaign consultant John Kern, a 
member of the advisory board, put it: "One change begets another that begets 
another." 
</P>
<P>
And, though the council members typically pay homage to issues such as 
community identity and ethnic balance when speaking of redistricting, they also 
recognize another vital point: The lines they draw can help stock their 
districts with friendly voters or purge them of hostile ones. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's just say that you've got at least eight people who are very interested 
in how this comes out," consultant Lewis said. "Very interested."

WILLIE BROWN DENIES CONNECTION WITH SILBERMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown on Saturday emphatically denied allegations that 
he may have funneled into his law practice money from businesses with an 
interest in bills considered by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, a San Francisco Democrat, said the charges, attributed by the FBI to 
convicted San Diego businessman Richard T. Silberman, are "totally and 
completely unsupported." 
</P>
<P>
"It's an irresponsible allegation made by a sick man who's been convicted," 
Brown told The Times in an interview on the Assembly floor. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman's comments were reflected in notes taken by an FBI agent in April, 
1989, when Silberman was arrested on charges of laundering money characterized 
by an undercover agent as drug-trafficking profits. Silberman, once the top 
aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., was convicted June 28 of violating 
federal currency law and awaits sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his arrest, according to the FBI, Silberman sought leniency by 
offering to set up Brown and others he said he had helped establish foreign 
corporations to launder money. 
</P>
<P>
Notes of the meeting, taken by FBI agent Charles Walker, indicate that 
Silberman described Chula Vista City Councilman David Malcolm as Brown's 
"bagman" and that Brown's San Francisco law office had a connection to 
legislation involving the state unitary tax law and the proposed merger of 
Southern California Edison Corp. and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the notes read: 
</P>
<P>
"7/83 -- Jap. meeting re unitary tax" 
</P>
<P>
"25K 'legal fee' -- millions in savings" 
</P>
<P>
After leaving former Gov. Brown's staff, Silberman lobbied the Legislature on 
behalf of Japanese business interests seeking to overhaul the state's unitary 
tax law, which involves the way the state assesses multinational corporations 
that do business in California. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the Legislature revised the system in a way more favorable to foreign 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, speaking after the Assembly completed a rare Saturday session 
deliberating on the state budget, said he had "no connection at all" to any of 
the businesses Silberman represented. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd really like to have him go through my client list and tell me which one of 
those non-Japanese were involved in the unitary matter," Brown said. "I 
represent developers and movie stars and record executives and that's it. I 
don't have any other clients." 
</P>
<P>
Brown also said his law firm has never been connected to Southern California 
Edison. And he said he had "no idea" why Silberman would describe Malcolm as 
his "bagman" -- a term used in political circles to describe a person who acts 
as an intermediary for illicit payments from special interests to elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Brown has twice appointed Malcolm to the state Coastal Commission, but he said 
he first did so at the recommendation of local officials and members of the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
"I rejected Malcolm twice," Brown said. "I rejected him because he was a 
Republican. They kept sending him back. (State Sen.) Lucy Killea (D-San Diego) 
and (Assemblyman) Pete Chacon (D-San Diego) and all the Republicans in this 
house and Democrats in this house lobbied me to accept the recommendations, and 
I did and I'm really glad I did. 
</P>
<P>
"David's turned out to be a first-class guy. I wish I could get him to raise 
money for me." 
</P>
<P>
Despite his denials, Brown said he could understand why Silberman, desperate to 
escape prosecution, would try to finger him. 
</P>
<P>
"I practiced law for a long time, and every time I've represented anybody who's 
gotten nailed, the first thing they start asking me about is, is there some way 
we can give them (the police) somebody," Brown said. "They say we'll give them 
somebody who can't get back at us, and we'll give them somebody they might 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
"Why Willie Brown? I have no idea. I have no connection at all."

SHOOTING QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My stepson, Charles Barker, was the subject of a story printed in the San Diego 
edition of the Los Angeles Times ("Slain Teen Had 2 Sides to His Life, Friends 
Say," June 25). I would like to commend H.G. Reza for portraying my stepson as 
the quiet, polite person he was. The article was researched and the facts were 
presented in a most professional manner, while avoiding undue sensationalism. 
</P>
<P>
I do, however, feel compelled to comment on two issues, one pertaining to the 
story and the other to the case. 
</P>
<P>
In regard to the story, the issue I have is with the comments made by the 
Madison High School official who chose not to be identified. The school 
official was quoted as saying Chuck was "kicked out of Madison." Elsewhere, the 
story states that Chuck was expelled from Madison. 
</P>
<P>
I was present when the decision was made to have Chuck leave Madison and 
transfer to Twain Junior-Senior High School. It was not presented to me or to 
his mother that this was an expulsion. He was not "kicked out." We mutually 
agreed that Chuck was not doing well at Madison, and that a transfer to Twain 
would be in his best interest. 
</P>
<P>
The second issue I have is with the treatment of the case by the district 
attorney (who ruled the shooting a justifiable homicide). I will be the first 
to say my stepson did wrong and deserved to be punished. I do not defend nor 
condone his actions. He chose to break the law, and that was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
He did not, however, deserve to be shot to death. According to police, the 
events of the case were: two boys wearing stocking masks approached a man and 
said, "Freeze -- give me your wallet." At this point, the man feigned a heart 
attack, pulled a weapon and fired one fatal shot. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I grieve the loss of a child and, at the same time, are shocked to 
learn that our boy had attempted a robbery. (But) the laws of this country 
clearly state that the punishment must fit the crime. Attempted robbery does 
not warrant the death penalty.

AN 'OLD LADY' GOES BACK TO SCHOOL; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: STILL RAISING A FAMILY, THIS 39-YEAR-OLD HOUSEWIFE IS RETURNING TO 
COLLEGE TO COMPLETE HER DEGREE AND EARN A TEACHING CREDENTIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNE GORMAN, Jeanne Gorman lives in Escondido with her husband, Tom, who 
completed his bachelor's degree in 1973, while she worked as a hospital 
administrator's secretary to support him. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My husband is proud of me, the kids think it's funny, and I think I'm crazy. 
</P>
<P>
Here I am, a 39-year-old housewife with thoughts of one day teaching high 
school English, deciding to go back to college. 
</P>
<P>
What am I doing? 
</P>
<P>
The last time I studied a college catalogue this intensely was half a life ago, 
back when I drove a red-hot Mustang between the sorority house and campus. 
Today I'm commander of a powder-blue Ford Aerostar, car-pooling neighborhood 
kids between home and school. 
</P>
<P>
I've got a son going into his sophomore year of high school and a daughter 
heading into fifth grade, and, instead of riding them to do their homework, I'm 
casting about for my own. Back when I was first in college, I was in awe of old 
ladies in their 30s who had the guts to parade around a college campus. Now I 
am that old lady. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, as an 18-year-old, I felt I had to specialize in something. I 
focused on English and, during my first three years, earned just about all the 
credits I needed to qualify as an English major. Now I find myself short on my 
general education requirements -- the stuff that will make me appropriately 
well-rounded in the classroom. Isn't housebreaking a husband and raising two 
children worth, say, 9 or 12 units? 
</P>
<P>
Back then was 1969-73 at Cal State Fullerton, where I set off for a B.A. degree 
and ended up sidetracked in my junior year with an MRS. Now it's back to school 
-- as a Mrs. -- to finish my B.A. requirements and then earn a teaching 
credential. 
</P>
<P>
Is this mid-life crisis or simply time to give some serious thought to an old 
notion? I believe there is no finer profession than parenthood, salary 
notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
But, when I consider that my passion for literature has not diminished over the 
years, maybe it's time I seriously begin to apply it. I've nurtured my own 
children's reading skills; imagine the challenge -- and rewards -- of working 
with an entire classroom of teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, some -- and maybe most -- of them won't see what use they have for 
Dickens or Milton. But, if I can educate the bunch, and inspire a few . . . 
</P>
<P>
First, though, I've got to get myself through school. 
</P>
<P>
At least I won't be the only new kid on campus. I enrolled at Cal State San 
Marcos, the new university that will have its grand opening in August. (The 
last grand opening I celebrated was at the mall.) 
</P>
<P>
This fall, Cal State San Marcos will have 500 students on the entire campus. 
Fullerton's campus played host to 25,000 students, with lecture halls large 
enough to accommodate 500. 
</P>
<P>
Based on Cal State San Marcos' graduation requirements, I think it would have 
been easier graduating with my husband at Cal State Fullerton (and getting a 
diploma bearing Ronald Reagan's signature as governor). 
</P>
<P>
Now, for instance, the university of the '90s wants its students steeped in an 
international perspective. So I've got to take 15 units in something called 
"global awareness" -- one class focusing on the United States, two classes 
studying Europe and two classes studying Third World society and culture. 
Classes like "American Society and Institutions," "Industrialization of Europe" 
and "Mexico and Her Neighbors." Oh, Homer, I never really liked geography. 
</P>
<P>
Then I've got to take three units in something called "race, class and gender." 
("Women in Literature" qualifies, and so does "Introduction to American Ethnic 
and Multicultural Studies.") 
</P>
<P>
Get this: Everyone's required to take three units of study "designed to equip 
students for lifelong understanding and development of themselves as integrated 
physiological, social and psychological entities." How can school accomplish in 
one semester what my family's been trying to do for the past 20 years? 
</P>
<P>
And I love this: I've got to demonstrate within the first year that I'm 
computer literate. Of course I can boot my computer. I drop-kicked it just the 
other day when it ate the letter I was writing to my sister. 
</P>
<P>
This course sounds intriguing: "Sp.Tp. PSCI:USSR-Gvrn&amp;Econ." Do I get a 
unit of credit just for figuring out what it stands for? How about 
"Sp.Tp.Am.Hst:Rsch CA Hst?" 
</P>
<P>
My 15-year-old son suggests I take "Sociology of Deviance." Ten-year-old 
daughter favors "Molecular Genetics Laboratory" because she's wondering just 
how related she is to her older brother. Husband thinks I ought to consider 
"Intro to Number Theory," maybe as it relates to my checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, I'll sign up for "Pop.Lit:Communities Transt." I'm not sure what 
it is, but heck, it qualifies for both global awareness and race, class and 
gender and it's in my major. 
</P>
<P>
And I need to take an upper-division math or science course. My son's high 
school math leaves me in a black hole, so I'll do something in science. "Stress 
Biology" sounds right down my alley: "The study of the physiological responses 
of mammals to extremes in their environment: temperature, hydrostatic and 
barometric pressure, emotional strain, water restriction, food deprivation, and 
exercise." 
</P>
<P>
That's perfect. Emotional strain is being on the brink of 40. Water restriction 
is having to ask for a glass of it at a restaurant. Food deprivation is 
something I deal with at midnight. 
</P>
<P>
And exercise is when I get out of bed every MWF to get my butt to class.

GROWTH RESTRICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I understand that the San Diego City Council is considering adoption of an 
urgency ordinance that includes a long-range growth-management plan. 
</P>
<P>
I strongly oppose any further restrictions on new development and urge the 
council not to adopt the ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
The traffic standards being proposed as part of the city's growth-management 
plan are unrealistic and unattainable. The plan proposes to mandate that new 
development bear the entire burden and responsibility for building, maintaining 
and financing the city's transportation facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Under this plan, no new development would be able to meet the traffic standards 
being proposed. Using today's traffic standards, 43% of the roadway facilities 
are already below the standards that would be mandated by the city's plan. In 
essence, new development would be held hostage to the ability of the city to 
generate potentially billions of dollars in new taxes to resolve existing 
deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
Building permits in this region have already dramatically slowed, and more 
government fees and regulations will only choke the economy of San Diego.

DORM DILEMMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Berol ("A Solution to Mini-Dorm Dilemma," June 24) makes an eloquent 
appeal for protecting our neighborhoods from the insidious erosion inflicted by 
unregulated housing. 
</P>
<P>
The economic appeal provided by renting single-family houses to students is 
hard to resist. 
</P>
<P>
Pacific Beach, like La Jolla and the college area, is particularly hard-hit by 
the additional traffic, noise and all-around density fostered by this practice. 
</P>
<P>
The result: as houses fill to capacity and streets become long parking lots, 
any semblance of a single-family neighborhood is lost to the expediency of 
housing more and more people. As long as the colleges and universities ignore 
their responsibility to house the students they attract to our city, the city 
at large will suffer, students and residents alike.

L.A. STUDIES WATERS OFF REDONDO BEACH FOR SEWAGE OUTFALL; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: THE PLAN -- ONE OF THREE BEING CONSIDERED -- CALLS FOR DUMPING 350 
MILLION GALLONS OF EFFLUENT A DAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE HATCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles is considering construction of a second ocean outfall 
for its giant Hyperion sewage plant, and one of the three routes being studied 
slices south into waters off Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal for another tunnel-sized outfall, which would be from three to 
five miles long, is in its early planning stages. The city's Department of 
Public Works has yet to receive approval for the estimated $170-million to 
$200-million project from permitting agencies or the Los Angeles City Council. 
And an environmental impact report will not be ready for public review until 
March, 1991, at the earliest, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the prospect of 350 million gallons of effluent per day entering South 
Bay waters is already stirring local opposition. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very concerned," said Torrance City Councilman Dan Walker, who sits on a 
state water panel that would have to review the outfall proposal. "We have the 
best of a bad water quality situation in Santa Monica Bay, and now they want to 
give us this." 
</P>
<P>
Richard Bonham of the South Bay Boaters Assn., a grouping of King Harbor 
boaters, said, "We've got to be very vigilant," and if the plan goes ahead "we 
have to fight it tooth and nail." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles officials say they are considering a new outfall because the 
principal one in use cannot handle all the plant's effluent by force of gravity 
alone, requiring the plant to use costly electric pumps. 
</P>
<P>
These large pumps push the treated sewage through that outfall -- a 
12-foot-diameter line that extends five miles almost due west from Hyperion -- 
when the flow from Hyperion exceeds a rate of 325 million gallons a day. Plant 
Manager John Crosse says the pumps are in use 16 to 17 hours a day, running up 
electric bills of $100,000 a month, or $1.2 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
Another problem, officials say, is that occasional power outages idle the 
pumps, and excess effluent is sent through an emergency outfall that discharges 
just one mile offshore. 
</P>
<P>
Sanitation officials argue that with Hyperion's sewage flows growing year by 
year, future power failures could hold increasingly serious consequences -- 
especially during wet weather, when rainwater seeps into the system and sewage 
flows are at their height. 
</P>
<P>
"We could be receiving a billion gallons a day during wet weather after the 
year 2000," Crosse said. "With only the five-mile outfall, the one-mile outfall 
and no pumps, there's a potential we wouldn't be able to get the (sewage) out 
of the plant. We'd flood the plant." 
</P>
<P>
Crosse says Hyperion now handles an average flow of 365 million gallons daily, 
with flows during the 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. peak hours reaching a rate of 500 
million gallons a day. In wet weather peak flows have approached 700 million 
gallons per day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and a private consulting company are studying three main routes 
for a new outfall. One would run alongside the current 5-mile line, another 
would extend slightly to the north and the third would be angled southward, 
toward the underwater Redondo Canyon off Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Each route includes options for three-, four- or five-mile outfall lengths that 
end in two branches, called diffusers, of several possible sizes. City 
sanitation officials say they are considering 18 outfall variations in all. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Naydo, the chief of construction at Hyperion, says the goal is to wind 
up with a reinforced concrete pipeline that is 12 to 13 feet in diameter and 
capable of handling a gravity flow of up to 350 million gallons of effluent 
daily. The price, he says, would be $170 million to $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
Naydo declined to say which of the three routes is preferred for the outfall, 
but he said there are two engineering arguments against the southern option and 
one in favor of it. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the comparatively smoother routes to the north, the southerly path 
crosses rocky terrain that would be more difficult to build on. It also enters 
a portion of the Palos Verdes Hills fault zone, making it more vulnerable to 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
The route's chief benefit, however, is that the sea floor drops off more 
sharply in the direction of the Redondo Canyon than it does along the other 
routes. According to Naydo, that means the line doesn't have to be as long to 
reach the depths at which effluent disperses adequately. 
</P>
<P>
"The deeper you discharge the less chance there is that it will impact 
near-shore areas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The first opportunity for public review of the proposal comes next March, after 
release of the draft environmental impact report, but opponents of the 
southerly route have been quick with criticism. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Boaters Assn. President Sandy Overland says her group is worried that 
a sewage outfall in the area might damage marine life in the Redondo Beach 
Canyon, which she described as a "darned good fishery." She questions the need 
for building an outfall at all. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd prefer they recycle (treated effluent) and use it to water parks and golf 
courses, things like that," Overland said. "Let's try to save our water and 
save our ocean at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Sanitation officials said such water reuse is already being done but cannot 
begin to offset the increases in sewage expected from the current pace of 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Elected officials have also begun drawing a bead on the outfall issue. 
</P>
<P>
Walker says that although "a good case can probably be made for an additional 
outfall," it should be built near the current one, not extended into waters 
that have not been subjected to outfall contaminants. Walker sits on the state 
Regional Water Quality Control Board, one of the regulatory groups that would 
have to rule on whether to allow the outfall project. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo Beach Mayor Brad Parton agrees. "I wouldn't want to see (an outfall) 
off Redondo Beach," Parton said, adding that Redondo Beach City Council members 
share his view. "In the north part of the bay they've had 'Keep out of the 
ocean' signs a lot more more than we have here. . . . This whole thing makes me 
nervous." 
</P>
<P>
John Dorsey, head biologist of the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation's 
environmental monitoring division, says the ocean bottom off the beach cities 
has not been completely free from outfall pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
In past years, contaminants from the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts' 
sewage outfalls off White Point have rounded the Palos Verdes Peninsula, 
settling in sediment off the beach cities, he says. 
</P>
<P>
But Dorsey, speaking for himself and not for his agency, says he sees merit in 
the argument that a second outfall should not be extended into a new portion of 
the bay. 
</P>
<P>
"My personal feeling is that . . . you might as well run it as close to the 
existing one as possible," Dorsey said, "not go to a whole different part of 
the bay that hasn't seen all the effects (of an outfall)."

LAWNDALE AGENCY LOSES YOUTH FUNDS OVER ASBESTOS FLAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The administrator of a federally funded youth employment program has decided 
not to place student workers with the Lawndale Public Works Department this 
summer in the wake of an asbestos-exposure controversy involving the city. 
</P>
<P>
The decision came two weeks after Joe Maradiaga, a former part-time city 
employee, told the City Council that he and other youths working for the Public 
Works Department were unknowingly exposed to asbestos last summer while 
cleaning up rubble left from the demolition of three city-owned buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Public Works Director James Sanders pleaded not guilty to criminal charges for 
his role in razing the buildings in violation of state and federal regulations 
covering the handling of asbestos. City Manager James Arnold, who was ousted 
from his post this week, also pleaded not guilty in the case. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot going on with the Public Works Department and allegations, and 
it did not seem to me (to be) the best environment for youth to be working in," 
said Gardena Assistant City Manager Mitch Lansdell, who administers the federal 
program for Gardena and Lawndale. "When there are other work sites available 
that provide good work experiences for youth, it doesn't seem appropriate to 
place them" with Lawndale's Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
Lansdell said Friday he decided in June not to place summer employees with the 
Lawndale agency after reading newspaper accounts concerning the 
asbestos-exposure case and discussing the charges with Lawndale's youth 
employment coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
The program is still paying for 35 Lawndale youth workers. About half of them 
have taken jobs with other city departments and the remainder are working with 
the schools and in businesses. 
</P>
<P>
In a memo to the City Council, Sanders criticized Lansdell's decision, saying 
the work the youths did in his department should not be lost because of 
complaints from one disgruntled teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
Maradiaga was employed with the summer youth program in June, 1989, when he was 
asked to help clean up the demolition site. He said recently that he and the 
other youths were never told there was asbestos at the site and were not 
ordered to wear any special clothing, as required by federal health and safety 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
Maradiaga, who was hired as a regular part-time employee a few months after the 
summer program ended, said he didn't learn that the razed buildings contained 
asbestos until this April. He said in an interview that he was fired by Sanders 
for making copies of a city-commissioned lab report on the asbestos case. 
</P>
<P>
Maradiaga's allegations are under investigation by the district attorney's 
office, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Anthony Patchett, who is prosecuting Sanders 
and Arnold for the alleged asbestos disposal violations. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders declined to be interviewed about Maradiaga's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold's attorney, Patricia Friedel, has said there were legitimate reasons for 
Maradiaga's firing that are "unrelated to the copying incident." 
</P>
<P>
In Sanders' memo to the City Council, which was made public Thursday night, 
Sanders said Maradiaga "is trying to get even by making trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Maradiaga had worked on the demolition site 10 days after asbestos "was first 
observed" there, and youth workers were used "in the final stage of the project 
to pick up small chunks of concrete and black top which were too small or 
scattered to be picked up mechanically," according to the memo. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders also wrote that Lansdell should have consulted with the city manager 
before making his decision to bar youth workers from taking jobs with the 
Public Works Department. He also recommended that the council consider 
administering its own program. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems irresponsible to make such an important decision on a significant 
benefit to Lawndale based on misinformation from a disgruntled, former, 
part-time, 19-year-old employee," Sanders wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Harold Hofmann said Thursday that Lansdell had "an obligation to let us 
know they were going to cut us off" and that the program's administrator "just 
overstepped (his) bounds a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Carol Norman disagreed, saying, "When you have the welfare of 
younger people to consider, are you going to allow these people to . . . 
perhaps be in danger? I can fully understand why there would be a cessation of 
the program" in the Public Works Department, she said. 
</P>
<P>
A decline in federal funding has forced the program to cut back by 10 the 
number of student workers in both Gardena and Lawndale, Lansdell said. 
</P>
<P>
This summer, 17 of the 35 student workers assigned to Lawndale are working for 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
The program pays the salaries of low-income students seeking employment and 
takes applications from employers who want to provide the jobs.

COALITION USES LOUD VOICE TO HAVE ITS SAY WITH POLITICIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Power has always derived from two main sources, money and people. Lacking 
money, the Have-Nots must build power from their own flesh and blood. 
</P>
<P>
 -- social reformer Saul Alinsky 
</P>
<P>
In less than two years, an unlikely coalition of grass-roots activists from the 
San Fernando Valley's political backwaters has grown into a powerful, if 
sometimes abrasive, voice for those who traditionally have had little to say 
about the way their communities were run. 
</P>
<P>
The organization, VOICE, an acronym for Valley Organized In Community Efforts, 
has led campaigns against abandoned cars, gangs and assault weapons, and most 
recently won important victories in an anti-graffiti campaign that included 
sponsoring legislation that would raise money to scrub the city of Los Angeles 
clean of illegal writings. 
</P>
<P>
A broad-based coalition of 20 churches and synagogues with a combined 
membership of 25,000 families, VOICE also has developed a reputation for 
putting politicians on the spot by extracting promises from them before 
thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
These tactics, though often successful, have caused some elected leaders to 
accuse the organization of being too confrontational. 
</P>
<P>
"Their rigidity disturbs me," Los Angeles Councilwoman Joy Picus said. "It 
doesn't endear them to me. I don't like confrontations. I don't like being 
treated as the enemy, especially when we share the same goals." 
</P>
<P>
But, said Father David Ullrich, a VOICE leader and pastor of Santa Rosa 
Catholic Church in San Fernando, the organization provides "a way to give a 
voice to the voiceless." 
</P>
<P>
"We've been taught that it's not nice to raise your voice," he said, "but it's 
really silly not to." 
</P>
<P>
This week, with its anti-graffiti campaign winding down, VOICE will begin an 
attack on what its leaders say is a serious social ill -- the state of public 
education in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The organization will launch its "Kids First" campaign Thursday at East Los 
Angeles College. It will be a joint effort with VOICE's sister organizations -- 
the older and more experienced East Los Angeles-based United Neighborhood 
Organizing Committee, or UNO; the South Central Organizing Committee in Los 
Angeles, or SCOC; and the East Valley Organization, or EVO, in the San Gabriel 
and Pomona valleys. 
</P>
<P>
"VOICE will not rest until all children can receive a quality education," said 
Msgr. James Loughnane, pastor at St. Joseph the Worker Church in Canoga Park. 
It still remains to be seen whether the entrenched problems of education will 
respond to VOICE's grass-roots efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The seeds from which VOICE grew were sewn four years ago, when Father Tom Rush, 
then the pastor of Santa Rosa Church, set out to form a religion-based 
coalition of community crusaders ranging from the barrios of Pacoima and San 
Fernando to the upper-middle-class neighborhoods in Tarzana and Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Ullrich, who took over in 1987 after Rush was transferred to another parish, 
said he approached leaders of other area churches and synagogues in an effort 
to persuade them that by banding together, they could improve the quality of 
life for their members wherever they lived. This was a new approach in the 
Valley, where political issues usually are tackled by fragmented homeowners 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
So successful was the effort that by the time VOICE was launched by a crowd of 
1,200 cheering people Nov. 22, 1988, at Cal State Northridge, 15 churches and 
synagogues representing about 20,000 families already had joined the 
organization. Hundreds of members have learned how to lobby politicians. Julio 
Pardo, a factory worker from Pacoima who had never before spoken to a 
politician, now is a regular in the halls of the Legislature in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, the organization's goals were to fight drug dealing and liquor sales 
to minors and to get rid of abandoned cars on residential streets. Eventually, 
VOICE members broadened their campaign to include gang problems and religious 
and racial discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking questions and we're making demands," said the Rev. Curtis Page, a 
VOICE leader and former pastor of Kirk O' the Valley Presbyterian Church in 
Reseda. "It's no longer a matter of the politicians lecturing to us, but of us 
telling them what to do. We believe that people have the right to determine for 
themselves what is best for them. Through our training, we empower people to 
take control of their own lives." 
</P>
<P>
Funding comes from the member congregations. Annual dues range from $500 to 
$7,000, depending on the size of a congregation. VOICE had an initial budget of 
$187,000 to hire professional organizers, open an office and send members to 
leadership training courses. Its annual budget now is about $85,000, Page said. 
</P>
<P>
VOICE's brand of activism comes from the theories of the late social reformer 
Saul Alinsky, who rallied Chicago's Irish slums into a power bloc in the 1930s, 
and who founded the IAF, acronym for Industrial Areas Foundation, with which 
VOICE is affiliated. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have organized a vast, mass-people's organization, you can parade it 
visibly before the enemy and openly show your power," he wrote. "Power is not 
only what you have but what the enemy thinks you have." 
</P>
<P>
But Alinsky's tactics as employed by VOICE and its three sister organizations 
have drawn criticism from some elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, an angry Mayor Tom Bradley stalked out of a meeting with 
UNO. More recently, Bradley has drawn fire from some VOICE leaders for not 
immediately agreeing to a meeting with them on their anti-graffiti proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Late last week, Richard Alarcon, Bradley's Valley liaison, announced he had 
firmed up a date for a VOICE meeting with the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
VOICE leaders say they know their confrontational tactics offend elected 
officials, but they insist that the end justifies the means. 
</P>
<P>
"VOICE is definitely an irritant to some people," said IAF organizer Mike 
Clements. "But when people don't have access, they need to raise their voices. 
People who have traditionally been ignored have a voice in shaping public 
life." 
</P>
<P>
"We're not rude," Ullrich said. "But we do face up to things." 
</P>
<P>
True to Alinsky's writings, the sheer numbers of people who show up to support 
VOICE objectives appear to intimidate some politicians, some say. 
</P>
<P>
"It's eye-opening to watch some of the elected officials," said VOICE leader 
Flo Weber, a probation officer from Woodland Hills. "They've never seen so many 
people come before them to support an issue." 
</P>
<P>
Alinsky's methods were valid in his time, Picus said, but now should be adapted 
to acknowledge the change in times. "When Saul Alinsky organized in this 
manner, he was trying to help the truly helpless who have no allies," she said. 
"Now, they have allies." 
</P>
<P>
Invited to a VOICE assembly in May, Picus thought she was to speak to the group 
of more than 1,000 people who had gathered at Valley Beth Shalom in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Page confronted her on stage and pressed her to announce a position on 
an ordinance authored by Councilman Joel Wachs that would tax utility customers 
to raise millions of dollars annually for a continuing anti-graffiti program in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"They never told me they were going to ask that question," said Picus, who 
agreed to support the Wachs initiative. 
</P>
<P>
While some elected leaders criticize VOICE's methods, many admit they have been 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
The San Fernando City Council earlier this year approved an ordinance proposed 
by VOICE that requires store owners to keep cans of spray paint under lock and 
key to make it more difficult for graffiti writers to practice their craft. San 
Fernando also has made improvements at Las Palmas Park in the city's mainly 
minority south side at the request of VOICE. 
</P>
<P>
"They have the potential to be much more influential than they are," said one 
political aide, who asked not to be identified. "And they will become much more 
so. Look at what has happened with UNO in 11 years. UNO is now very powerful." 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who authored an anti-graffiti bill at the 
organization's request, said VOICE members played "a major role" in pushing the 
legislation through the Assembly. Their lobbying efforts "changed a few minds," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would allow local jurisdictions to place a tax on the sales of spray 
paint and wide felt-tip markers used by graffiti writers with the approval of 
two-thirds of voters. It must now be approved by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
VOICE's diversity helped to attract Weber and others to the organization. 
</P>
<P>
"It was important that we had a cross-section of the Valley," said Weber, who 
helped in organizing the group. "It's ecumenical and cross-cultural, and it's 
constantly growing." 
</P>
<P>
"What people have learned is that they have common problems no matter where 
they live," Page said. 
</P>
<P>
Malka Tasoff, who is now receiving VOICE leadership training, said the 
organization was the first she has seen "that strove toward a broad-based 
coalition. Here, you have the business community coming together with the 
Hispanic community, the Anglo community and the Jewish community. We're 
focusing on our commonality, on issues that concern us all." 
</P>
<P>
Page, who resigned from his church pastorship as of July 1 to become a 
professional organizer for the IAF, said the organizations will determine their 
course of action on education after they learn of members' concerns through a 
series of small "house meetings" now being held. 
</P>
<P>
"Education is a monumentally sized issue," Page said. "But whatever we do will 
come from the people." 
</P>
<P>
The education campaign could take several years, Page said. As it stands now, 
he said, the educational system in Los Angeles -- because of inadequate 
programs and a high dropout rate -- condemns many children to spend the rest of 
their lives in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Tasoff, a Tarzana attorney and a member of Valley Beth Shalom temple in 
Tarzana, said she is excited about the education project. 
</P>
<P>
"My impression is that VOICE is the only ray of hope we've got," she said. 
"I've been concerned about public education for years. I am concerned my 
children are not being educated." 
</P>
<P>
Millionaire businessman Richard Riordan, who has been active with IAF groups in 
Los Angeles, is organizing support among Los Angeles business leaders for the 
effort. Business and industry has a growing need for talented workers and Los 
Angeles schools are not supplying them, Riordan told a recent VOICE meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles is the wealthiest oasis in the history of mankind and yet we have 
a totally diseased education system," Riordan said.

POLICE SHUT DOWN PONY RIDES; 
</P>
<P>
ANIMALS: THE OPERATOR OF THE CONCESSION VOWS TO FIGHT AN ORDER TO CLOSE HER 
BUSINESS, WHICH HAS BEEN A FIXTURE IN RESEDA FOR 26 YEARS. 
</P>

<P>
Over the protesting shouts of several parents, Los Angeles animal regulation 
officers shut down a popular Reseda pony ride Saturday and cited its owner for 
operating the business without a city permit. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Menary, who started the weekend attraction 26 years ago, was allowed to 
keep 22 ponies at the two-acre site she owns at Tampa Avenue and Lanark Street, 
but was ordered not to operate the concession. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to fight this," said an upset Menary, whose petting farm draws about 
200 people each weekend. "I'm a fighter and I think I have a right to be here. 
This is my life." 
</P>
<P>
Menary defied an order to shut down the pony ride Saturday and said she would 
do the same today. 
</P>
<P>
If she does, the pony ride will be closed and Menary will be cited again, said 
Lt. Annetta Reeff of the Department of Animal Regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Until last year, Menary had housed the pony ride and assorted animals, 
including goats, sheep, chickens, turkeys, cows, a llama and an emu, on a 
nearby lot she owns in the same block of Tampa Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said that when she moved the rides, that canceled her long-held 
right to operate a commercial enterprise in a residential-agricultural zone. 
</P>
<P>
Menary was issued the order to shut down on July 3, Reeff said. 
</P>
<P>
"She has exhausted all of her administrative rights to appeal," Reeff said. "It 
has come down to the department to close her down. She has received enough 
notice." 
</P>
<P>
Several Los Angeles police officers were called to the pony ride and petting 
farm Saturday "to keep the peace" while the pony ride was being shut down, 
Officer Steven Ford said. "We don't like to do this," he said. "I used to come 
here when I was a kid." 
</P>
<P>
Several parents shouted insults at the officers as they went about their work. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody wants this lot for something," one man said. "Has to be a developer." 
</P>
<P>
Others said they would start a petition drive in support of Menary. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a learning experience," said Leslie Dahlquist of West Hills, a parent 
and first-grade teacher, "Where else can city kids come to experience farm 
life? Kids and animals. That's the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
Animal regulation officers cited Menary for various infractions of the Los 
Angeles Municipal Code, including operating a pony ride without a permit, using 
animals to draw a crowd, keeping roosters too close to a nearby residence, 
harboring unlicensed horses and keeping wild animals (the llama and the emu) in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Menary was ordered to appear on the citations July 20 in Van Nuys Municipal 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
She is due July 18 in the same court on similar citations issued last year. 
</P>
<P>
Her attorney, Ronald M. Cohen, said he will ask for a jury trial for his 
client. 
</P>
<P>
He also said he will ask the court to rule on whether Menary can obtain a 
permit to operate the pony ride and whether she has the right to appeal to the 
City Council an earlier denial of the operating permit by the zoning board.

LAND A SMOKE SCREEN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two key questions arise out of the recent wheelings and dealings by the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy and Bob Hope over an access road to his property. 
</P>
<P>
Why is all this going on when the Draft EIRs for Hope's project and for the 
Liberty Canyon project (both with Potomac Investment Associates as developers) 
are not yet ready for public review? Could it be that the projects are so harsh 
on all aspects of the environment that the developers know they could never 
even attempt to mitigate them? So, to soften the impact of the environmental 
nightmare when the EIRs are finally released, they are laying a smoke screen in 
the guise of a large amount of "donated" land. 
</P>
<P>
The second question deals with the wildlife access corridor under the Ventura 
Freeway along Liberty Canyon Road. Currently, the underpass is used very little 
during the dark and early morning hours. This is one of the few documented 
passages left for wildlife to cross under the freeway between Calabasas and 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
In order to access Bob Hope's land, Potomac Investment Associates will extend 
Liberty Canyon Road north through their Liberty Canyon Project parcel next to 
the freeway. Since this road will be expensive to build, they are proposing 
over 1 million square feet of commercial development, including a 200-room 
hotel which will overlook the existing wildlife corridor. 
</P>
<P>
This, along with the road extension, will put an end to the wildlife passage 
and further sever the animal populations south of the freeway to the ocean. As 
stated time and again by many wildlife experts, when a habitat becomes 
fragmented, then native plant and animal species will become extinct. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe all those who feel this land swap is such a good deal should invest in 
plastic figures of deer, coyotes, fox, bobcats and mountain lions and place 
them strategically in the Santa Monica Mountains parks so that visitors can 
pretend that they saw some real animals.

2 MEN DIE FROM GUNSHOT WOUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two San Diego men died of gunshot wounds in separate incidents over the 
weekend, and police said they had no suspects in either case. 
</P>
<P>
In the first incident, Ignacio Orozco, 20, who had moved recently from 
Washington state to the 1600 block of 40th Street, died at 10:10 p.m. Friday at 
Paradise Valley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses had taken him there after he was shot in the chest and shoulder 
during an argument with another man about 9:40 p.m., San Diego police said. The 
shooting occurred near 40th and Delta streets. 
</P>
<P>
In the second shooting, police said a 27-year-old San Diego man died at Mercy 
Hospital within an hour of being shot early Saturday as he walked near 26th 
Street and Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said Ruben Zenteno, who lived in the 1600 block of Fern Street, was 
seen walking with a companion at 6 a.m. and that a few minutes later several 
gunshots rang out. 
</P>
<P>
Police responded at 6:14 a.m. and found Zenteno shot in the chest and arm. He 
died at Mercy at 7:02 a.m.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HEAD-ON COLLISION KILLS DRIVER OF PICKUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A pickup collided head-on with a Jeep in Lancaster Saturday, killing the 
truck's driver and injuring two people in the Jeep, the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities identified the dead woman as Joanne Hammond of Lancaster, described 
as being in her 30s. 
</P>
<P>
The two passengers in the Jeep -- Robert and Glynis O'Reilly -- were being 
treated for cuts and bruises at a hospital after the 12:30 p.m. accident at 7th

DANNEMEYER'S ATTACK ON MANDELA TERMED SHAMEFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article "Mandela Talk Draws Cheers From Congress" (June 27) by Times staff 
writer Edwin Chen was indeed inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
It is too bad that Republican Congressman William E. Dannemeyer from Fullerton 
had to show his narrow-minded attitude when he likened Mr. Mandela to H. Rap 
Brown and Willie Horton. Perhaps Rep. Dannemeyer has been too long in office 
and needs a long, worthwhile rest.

DISCERNING SELF-INTEREST ON AIRPORT SITE; 
</P>
<P>
COUNTY SUPERVISORS SHOULD KNOW WHERE DEVELOPER JOHNS IS COMING FROM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It would be difficult to be active in Republican politics in Orange County and 
not know William Buck Johns. A charming man with a down-home manner, Johns has 
repeatedly opened his Santa Ana Heights estate to political events for such GOP 
figures as Vice President Dan Quayle and Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.). Johns 
also is a prominent member of the Lincoln Club, the county's most prestigious 
Republican support group. 
</P>
<P>
Johns' role in the GOP gives him added credibility in certain circles, 
including those in which the members of the County Board of Supervisors -- all 
of whom are Republicans -- move. But Johns also is a shrewd land developer and 
businessman. The board must keep this in mind as it considers a proposal touted 
by the Transportation Alternatives for Southern California, a private group of 
which Johns is patron and co-founder. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with pointers, maps and artists' renderings, TASC is drumming up support 
for an idea to build a new international airport, which the county says is 
needed, in San Bernardino County. The idea would be to build the airport on 
what is now George Air Force Base. It would be linked with Orange County by a 
high-speed train envisioned as running from Anaheim to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, after a lengthy presentation by TASC, the Board of Supervisors voted 
4-0 (Harriett M. Wieder was absent) to support the idea. But later one 
supervisor, Thomas F. Riley, said he was surprised to learn that Johns had his 
own Riverside County development interests in mind when TASC made its 
presentation. "It made me wonder about what they were telling us," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
Riley and others on the board shouldn't have had to wonder. They should know 
where Johns is coming from. The selection of a new international airport site 
in Southern California to serve Orange County is one of the region's most 
important and vexing questions. It must be answered strictly on the basis of 
public need -- never on who might personally benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Johns hasn't hidden his private interest in this decision. He says, "My motives 
are simple: I'm trying to make a profit." But that wasn't the message given by 
TASC when it made its presentation to the board. 
</P>
<P>
It's possible that what TASC is proposing is best. But public officials must be 
aware that the information they are getting may be weighted in favor of those 
with something to gain. Whatever the board decides, it should know that TASC's 
proposal is motivated by self-interest.

WELCOME, LONG BEACH MEDICAL CENTER; 
</P>
<P>
BUT THE NUMBER OF COUNTY TRAUMA PATIENTS IT WILL BE ABLE TO TREAT IS YET TO BE 
SEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County trauma system, limping along on three good but overworked 
legs, should be running a lot more efficiently now that the Long Beach Memorial 
Medical Center is part of the system. 
</P>
<P>
But precisely how much difference the recent addition of the highly regarded 
Los Angeles County hospital and its trauma team will make remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
When the Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center dropped out of 
the four-hospital network last December because of the financial strain, the 
volume of emergency patients at the three remaining trauma centers increased 
considerably. Long Beach Memorial, which is a top-rated emergency facility, 
will ease some of that pressure. 
</P>
<P>
More important, its location will speed the time it takes to get injury victims 
in the north coastal area of Orange County to the emergency room, which should 
save some lives that otherwise might be lost. That in itself justifies the new 
affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
But the expected 250 to 300 Orange County trauma patients that the Long Beach 
center is expected to treat annually are considerably fewer than the 900 or 
more patients that Fountain Valley had been caring for. Many of those will 
continue jamming the emergency rooms at UCI Medical Center and Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana in the central part of the county, where more of a crisis in 
emergency care exists than in South County at Mission Hospital Regional Medical 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
To stay solvent, hospitals need a good "patient mix" between the number of 
insured patients and indigents, who are more costly for hospitals to treat 
because reimbursements are so low. 
</P>
<P>
Because Los Angeles County has even more indigent patients than Orange County, 
Memorial should have a better balance of patients. But whether it will treat 
enough indigents to ease the burden on other trauma centers in Orange County's 
network is the unknown factor. 
</P>
<P>
So, as important as Memorial's addition is to the trauma network, it still 
leaves untreated the fundamental and chronic problem facing emergency medical 
care here and in many other places: a shortage of money to adequately support 
the system. 
</P>
<P>
Federal, state and county government have to face up to their responsibility 
and provide the health care system with the transfusion of money it needs. 
</P>
<P>
Until they do, too many patients, and the hospitals in the area desperately 
trying to care for them, will remain at risk.

ROCKWELL CITED FOR NOT FILING SAFETY REPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has issued a violation notice to Rockwell 
International for failing to submit required reports on the radiation safety 
program at its Santa Susana Field Laboratory west of Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell is required to file a quarterly review that evaluates radiation 
measurements, waste discharges and worker radiation exposures at the site. 
</P>
<P>
According to the violation notice, the company has yet to file these reports 
for the third and fourth quarters of 1989 and was late in filing reports for 
the first two quarters of last year. 
</P>
<P>
The NRC characterized this as a level-four violation on a scale of one to five, 
with one being the most serious. "It's what we would call more than minor 
significance," NRC spokesman Greg Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a minor violation," but "I'm not pleased with the situation," said Clark 
Gibbs, director of the Atomics International segment of Rockwell's Rocketdyne 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
Nuclear activity has stopped at Santa Susana, except for decontamination and 
disposal work. Rockwell's radiation safety staff has dwindled in recent months, 
but Gibbs said he did not know if this was the reason the quarterly reviews 
weren't filed. 
</P>
<P>
The NRC did not fine Rockwell, but the notice, dated June 22, gave the company 
30 days to explain in writing the reason for the violation and corrective steps 
it will take.

POLICE COMMITMENT STIRS APPRECIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On June 26, officer Tommy De La Rosa was laid to rest. I didn't know him that 
well. Those who did used phrases such as "tough cop," "tender family man," 
"loyal friend and police officer." 
</P>
<P>
He was eulogized as a "good cop" committed to the welfare of others and the 
enforcement of the law. 
</P>
<P>
Peace officers swear an oath that involves the possibility of death -- they 
place the community's welfare above their own. 
</P>
<P>
Our society's support of individual freedom and self-determinism is a magnet to 
many in the world community. Though it is difficult, we constantly seek a 
balance between individual rights and majoritarian rights (public protection). 
</P>
<P>
Where millions of people coexist, the law defines the boundaries of individual 
freedom. Peace officers enforce these laws -- laws that allow us freedom yet 
restrict the infringement by others on that freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers are cohesive force in our community -- laws and their 
enforcement make our quality of life possible. Peace officers help to hold our 
society together. 
</P>
<P>
After attending Tommy De La Rosa's memorial service, I was impressed by more 
than the familiar presence of authority. As the son of a retired Fullerton 
police officer, I've known cops all of my life. During the grieving and 
mourning, men and women -- as bighearted and human as any I've known -- said 
goodby to a fellow officer and reaffirmed their commitment to their duties. 
</P>
<P>
I appreciate that commitment, as do many others.

DANNEMEYER'S ATTACK ON MANDELA TERMED SHAMEFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On June 26, the Orange County delegation, with but one exception, hid behind 
the Orange Curtain and peeped out at Nelson Mandela in ignorance and fear. 
</P>
<P>
Ignoring the honor bestowed upon Mandela by their peers in Congress, C. 
Christopher Cox, William Dannemeyer, Robert Dornan and Ron Packard missed the 
powerful and inspirational congressional address made by a man making history 
in his country and our own. 
</P>
<P>
You do not, gentlemen, represent this resident of the county. Your remarks on 
the subject are an embarrassment, Willie Horton a ludicrous analogy. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela cited American heroes and their deeds in the course of his speech. We 
are indeed a proud nation -- brave, strong, and free. And make no mistake, we 
have shed blood to protect our freedoms. We cannot claim the patience with 
restrictions placed upon this freedom that has been endured by black South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
We must not fear the challenge to inequality and minority rule that inspired 
our Declaration of Independence, or equate such a fight for freedom with 
communism to lend legitimacy to our fears. 
</P>
<P>
But, sadly, every coward has his yellow streak. And from behind the Orange 
Curtain, it seems yellow and orange do make red.

COURTESY TITLE TRENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There is a sensible trend in the use of titles for addressing men and women 
that should satisfy Lynn Spear Merles (Letters, June 21). 
</P>
<P>
Men have long been addressed as Mr. whether married or single. Addressing all 
women as Miss (written Ms. but not pronounced "Mizz") is being used more and 
more often. Many women do not want to be called Mrs., and it should not make 
any more difference than when addressing men as Mr. W. POWER

CRASH OF EXPERIMENTAL PLANE STIRS SAFETY DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The crash-landing of a small test plane at Torrance Municipal Airport last 
month has some residents and officials questioning whether experimental 
aircraft ought to be flying out of an airport that is in the midst of homes and 
small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
One city resident told the Torrance City Council on Tuesday that experimental 
airplanes like the one that crashed should not be flying over city 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think this is a safe situation," Joseph Arciuch complained. 
</P>
<P>
City Council members requested a staff report about the rules governing such 
experimental airplanes, which are primarily small, home-built craft. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a highly developed urban area," said Councilman Bill Applegate, who 
said that unproven planes that need fine tuning should be flown in a less 
developed area. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman George Nakano said that although he does not favor an outright ban, 
he does have concerns about the safety of experimental planes. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot of the plane, John Parker, 52, of Torrance, says the matter is being 
blown out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
His craft -- a small aluminum plane called "American Special" -- met all 
federal requirements, according to Parker, who is well-known among those who 
build and race their own planes. 
</P>
<P>
And some aviation experts say that experimental aircraft are being unduly 
criticized. 
</P>
<P>
"If you were going to build your own plane that you were going to fly, wouldn't 
you go the extra mile to make sure it was safe?" asked John Burton, spokesman 
at the Experimental Aircraft Assn., based in Oshkosh, Wis. "Home-built pilots 
have a vested interest in safety." 
</P>
<P>
The debate is not new. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, city officials talked of banning experimental aircraft last 
October after the crash of a home-built plane. They found out later that the 
city lacked authority to enact a sweeping ban on the planes. In that accident, 
a passenger in the plane was hurt, a home was set on fire and another was 
damaged. 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance accident was much less dramatic. Parker's plane had trouble 
shortly after taking off at 3:14 p.m. on June 28. The plane was attempting to 
land without power when it hit the ground, remaining upright, a witness said. 
</P>
<P>
"He landed hard. There was substantial damage to the aircraft and minor 
injuries to the pilot," said Barbara Abels, public affairs officer with the 
Federal Aviation Administration, Western Pacific Region. The FAA is 
investigating the cause of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
The plane was a "proof-of-concept" aircraft, said Parker, a craft he was using 
to test systems such as engine controls and landing gear. It had flown about 70 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not an airplane you fly every day. It's not a pleasure plane -- it's a 
research vehicle," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
Parker has flown and raced planes extensively. "He's quite well-known in the 
air-racing world," said Jack Cox, editor in chief of Experimental Aircraft 
Assn. publications. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate incident June 20, Parker's plane exceeded noise limits at the 
airport, said David Roelen, city environmental quality officer. Roelen said he 
wrote Parker, stating that any future complaints about noise levels would be 
referred to a city board that oversees airport noise matters. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA has special regulations for experimental aircraft, said Fred Farrar, a 
spokesman at the agency's Washington headquarters. They must get special 
air-worthiness certificates after an FAA inspection and must spend their first 
40 hours of flight over unpopulated areas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most experimental aircraft are built by owners from kits, though not every kit 
plane is an experimental craft.

UPHOLDING THE LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I know not what position others may take, but as for me, when I vote for local, 
state or federal office candidates, I expect that those candidates will 
recognize that they owe an unreserved allegiance to behave in conformity with 
the laws governing this land. 
</P>
<P>
If they wish to change the laws under which our governmental tiers operate, 
they have a perfect right to do so just as long as it is done within the limits 
set by Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Under those circumstances, I will support their right to do so, whether I agree 
with, or oppose, their position. 
</P>
<P>
I think it takes unbridled, dictatorial gall to tell officials of our 
government that they will be, or are putting themselves in jeopardy of being, 
excommunicated if they do what they have been elected to do. 
</P>
<P>
Most oaths of office include clauses requiring the candidate to agree to 
enforce the obligations of the office without reservations. If the candidate 
plans to have reservations about performing the legal duties of an office, the 
oath should not be taken and the nominee is not legally entitled to hold the 
office. If the candidate insists on declaring a higher loyalty to a person 
claiming to hold a mandate from the divinity, that allegiance should be 
exercised from the pulpit and not from a public office where a commitment has 
been made to uphold the laws of the land.

ANTI-GANG PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding the (June 23) editorial entitled "The Death of a 4-Year-Old," your 
comments are well-taken regarding the untimely death of an innocent youngster. 
However, I am distressed by some of the unfortunate language that stereotypes 
our community. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California does have gang problems. However, to characterize Garden 
Grove as one of six cities dominated by street gangs threatening innocent 
bystanders " . . . in the roughest sections . . . " is untrue. 
</P>
<P>
We do not consider Garden Grove to be dominated by gangs or that innocent 
bystanders are more liable to be victims than elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The Times may not know the solutions to ending gang violence, but to stay ahead 
of the gang problem here are some of the steps Garden Grove has taken. We 
instituted proactive police programs such as school education, special gang 
investigation units, more gang training and information for all officers, and 
joined a computerized information service with other law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Our Police Department is continually investigating and arresting all those who 
break the law, including gang members. We are proud of the law enforcement job 
that our police officers perform. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that in the future The Times will be more careful in assigning labels to 
cities, because we feel Garden Grove is dominated by good citizens.

NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FIGHT: DAYS OF BLANK CHECKS OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have just read the letter from Clark Hepworth that decries the state of the 
nation and ominously foresees the imminent destruction of democracy itself. 
</P>
<P>
Why? Why, due to the single-handed efforts of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher to 
implement some limitations in the National Endowment of the Arts grants, of 
course. (For which, in a segue of logic that reveals Hepworth's own remarkable 
gift for creativity, he succeeds in equating Rohrabacher with Hitler and 
Stalin.) 
</P>
<P>
Why, I wonder yet again, does Hepworth and others of his view have such 
difficulty in distinguishing the difference between censorship and sponsorship? 
(Could it be a case of the "simplistic mentality" he attributes to Rohrbacher?) 
</P>
<P>
Here it is again in simple terms: Rohrabacher is not trying to "control 
creative thought." Today's artists are as free as they ever were to create, 
produce and "think" anything they want to. The only issue is whether they are 
"entitled" to be subsidized in their efforts by the federal government (read: 
my tax dollars). 
</P>
<P>
How such an idea ever came into being in the first place is the really puzzling 
question, but the answer, anyway, is a resounding no. Look though you might, 
you will find no mention of it in the Bill of Rights -- so we can all rest easy 
on that score. 
</P>
<P>
The only remaining issue, then, is funding. If an artist finds it compromises 
his creative integrity to sign a waiver in which he must agree not to use the 
federal grant money to produce "works of art" that portray the sexual abuse of 
children, and other such unreasonable stipulations, then by all means let him 
exercise his right not to sign it. More power to him. He is then free to 
produce any and all manner of whatever "art" he desires with no restrictions 
whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
But, horror of horrors, he will simply have to pay for it himself.

ALLEGATIONS DISPUTED IN CASE OF THE PURLOINED KINKAJOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This letter is written to respond to allegations made against my client in two 
letters to the editor printed July 1. The letters were written by Priscilla 
Feral, a representative of Friends of Animals, and Kyle Owens, a representative 
of the Fund for Animals. 
</P>
<P>
First, there is an allegation made in the letter by Priscilla Feral that my 
client, Cary Chevalier, violated court rules, and thereby "unlawfully obtained 
the temporary restraining order" that allowed the University of California to 
take possession of the subject kinkajous. Nothing could be further from the 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
At the hearing on May 22, 1990, the court simply found that a simple procedural 
error had occurred regarding the return of the kinkajous. If, as claimed in the 
letter from Ms. Feral, the kinkajous had been "unlawfully obtained," then it is 
certain that the judge would have returned the animals to Primarily Primates 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, although there might have been a minor procedural error on the part 
of one of Mr. Chevalier's attorneys, it did not change the findings of the 
court that the animals should remain in the possession of Mr. Chevalier and the 
University of California. 
</P>
<P>
Further, Ms. Feral goes to great pains to argue that as a grand jury failed to 
indict the individuals who stole Mr. Chevalier's property, that no wrong could 
have been committed against Mr. Chevalier. We dispute this strongly and believe 
that at the close of the civil litigation, there will be sufficient evidence to 
demonstrate the injuries suffered by Mr. Chevalier and his animals. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Owens claims that the kinkajous were not taken illegally from Mr. 
Chevalier, and further claims that the experimentation performed by Mr. 
Chevalier has no valid scientific purpose. However, Mr. Owens provides no 
factual support for either of these allegations. Unfortunately, it is not 
unusual for people in our client's position to have to respond to allegations 
of his type. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, all of Mr. Chevalier's experimentation was performed without any harm 
to the kinkajous and with all of the appropriate authorizations pursuant to 
federal and state law, as well as the in-house rules of the University of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The only harm that has come to the animals has occurred while they were in the 
possession of the so-called "animal rights" groups. While the kinkajous were in 
their possession, two of the animals disappeared and one of the animals was 
castrated. 
</P>
<P>
Although we prefer to have these controversies aired within the context of the 
lawsuit presently pending in Texas, it is clear that certain animal rights 
groups are bent on pursuing these allegations in a public forum. Therefore, we 
felt we had no alternative but to address the allegations made against our 
client in that same public forum.

CHAOS GIVES WAY TO ORDER IN ITALY

If it were possible for a sporting event to take on human characteristics, the 
14th edition of the World Cup, which concludes Sunday with a championship game 
between Argentina and West Germany, would have come to life as a rebellious 
teen-ager, a family's black sheep. It repeatedly challenged soccer's 
stern-jawed order with surprising results only a rebel would dare offer. 
</P>
<P>
Only a rebel would eliminate Brazil and the Netherlands, two favorites, in the 
second round. Only a rebel would push Yugoslavia to within one missed penalty 
kick of the semifinals, and Ireland to the quarterfinals in its first Cup 
appearance. Only a rebel would allow little Costa Rica, also a Cup rookie, to 
beat Scotland and Sweden and advance to the second round. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, only a rebel would revel in England's fine run to the semifinals, a 
show accompanied by the constant brawling and lawlessness of the English 
hooligans, whose pathetic Drunks Over Italy tour led to daily arrests and came 
close to ruining the Cup experience for at least three cities. There is justice 
in the world if this collection of louts is consigned to the Bronx when the Cup 
comes to America in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
The tournament's best example of rebelliousness, though, was the Indomitable 
Lions of Cameroon, who beat Argentina in their first game, won their 
round-robin group and had a legitimate chance to bring the Cup home to their 
poor, troubled African nation, in what truly would have been one of the most 
remarkable stories in the history of sports. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this line of thinking: The Lions came within five minutes of 
eliminating England in the quarterfinals, England proceeded to play West 
Germany to a dead heat in the semifinals and now West Germany will play an 
Argentina team that is lacking three starters. It is not that great a stretch 
to envision the Lions winning. They certainly belonged. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the Cup field has been reduced to two teams, though, this strain of 
disorder has come to a sudden halt. It is as if the rebel suddenly has given up 
on his cause, or the black sheep has relented and agreed to go to law school. 
The championship game contains not an iota of anarchy. Out of chaos comes 
order: West Germany and Argentina have been the elite of this sport for more 
than a generation. 
</P>
<P>
Argentina is bidding for its third championship in a dozen years. West Germany 
has made the final now in three straight Cups and five of the past seven. They 
are alone at the top. Brazil has not reached a final in 20 years. Italy has won 
only once since Mussolini reigned. England invented the game, but its only Cup 
victory came on home soil 24 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The only difference between West Germany and Argentina is that their rises were 
along different angles of incline. Argentina's was sharp, a burst of Latin 
heat, a sudden ascension after decades as a soccer nonentity. West Germany 
assumed its place as soon as the country recovered its sporting legs after 
World War II, winning the Cup in its first post-War appearance, in 1954. 
Reflective of the organized, efficient German manner, the team's standard has 
not fallen in 36 years. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, and this is a fine way to start an argument, West Germany clearly is 
the world's most consistently successful team since World War II. Brazil has 
won one more World Cup (3-2), but its standard has dropped while West Germany 
has reached the semifinals in all but two of the Cups since 1954, winning 
another in 1974, all the while using different generations of players but an 
unchanging style based on technical superiority, physical strength and mental 
toughness. 
</P>
<P>
The Germans just do not give away a thing. In 1982, they rallied from a 3-1 
deficit in overtime of a semifinal to eliminate France. Four years ago, with an 
aging team from which little was expected, they reached the final and then 
rallied from a 2-0 deficit to tie Argentina late in the second half, only to 
lose to a last fit of Diego Maradona brilliance at the end. 
</P>
<P>
Argentina has no such tradition on which to call. The Argentines did make the 
final of the first Cup, in 1930, but after that they were reduced to being 
Brazil's little brother from South America, advancing beyond the second round 
only once in the next 44 years. They won when the Cup came to their country in 
1978, though, precipitating a soccer boom that resulted in the current 
generation of skillful players and Maradona. 
</P>
<P>
The two teams have reached the final in Rome in decidedly different manners. 
West Germany, along with Italy, was the class of the tournament throughout, 
displaying the crisp, inventive offense so lacking in the rest of the field. 
Argentina has slogged through a succession of injuries, ejections and poor 
performances, scoring only five goals in six games and winning only two in 
regulation time. 
</P>
<P>
This disparity has given rise to German confidence. "We are prepared to play 
Argentina and avenge our loss in the 1986 final," said Franz Beckenbauer, the 
West German coach. "They have not improved since 1986, and we have improved a 
great deal. We are very confident." 
</P>
<P>
Before they get too carried away, the Germans should note that Argentina's Cup 
record since 1978 is 18-4-3. Maradona's team is difficult to beat. But 
regardless of who wins, the matchup is an ending few envisioned when the Cup 
began and Argentina lost to Cameroon, initiating the run of disorder that 
lasted until, well, until now.

<P>
Hitting the home run that gave the Angels their second consecutive extra-inning 
victory Saturday brought extra satisfaction to Jack Howell. 
</P>
<P>
Howell's opposite-field home run with two out in the 11th inning lifted the 
Angels to a 4-3 victory in Milwaukee's County Stadium and boosted his 
confidence beyond what a .223 batting average would suggest. His diligence and 
willingness to take advantage of teammate Dave Winfield as a resource paid in a 
two-for-four performance that included Howell's first home run since June 21 
and gave reliever Mike Fetters his first major league victory. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're hitting below .200 and things aren't successful, you abandon a lot 
of things," said Howell, who hit a pitch from Randy Veres (0-1) into the 
left-field bullpen. "Not only DJ (hitting instructor Deron Johnson), but 
(equally) as important is Dave Winfield. Since Cleveland, when I sat out three 
games, I've been hitting with DJ and going over a bunch of different 
philosophies. One thing we talked about was hitting the outside pitch and going 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
"In my previous at-bat (a fly to the left-field warning track in the ninth 
inning), I thought I hit the ball fairly well. He was throwing me everything 
away, so I was looking for a pitch away and that's what he threw. As far as 
Winfield, the thing that's been the big key isn't mechanics but what pitchers 
are going to do. He told me I can hit the ball the other way, but it's been 
other things, too. Winfield hasn't stepped on any toes." 
</P>
<P>
Winfield, who entered the game as a defensive replacement in the 11th inning, 
downplayed his role in Howell's success. "We just talk some baseball," he said. 
"DJ's worked with him and I just talk to him like I talk to all my teammates." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, who are 4-5 on this trip with one game left, were able to talk 
about a sweep in Milwaukee because Fetters pitched two solid innings after 
starter Chuck Finley's nine-inning effort. Finley struck out a season-high 10 
batters but was unable to hold a 3-0 lead the Angels had provided him after 
four innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I did what I can do. I'm not disappointed with anything," said Finley, a 
27-year-old left-hander whose record remained at 11-4 with a 2.54 earned-run 
average and 84 strikeouts in 117 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just one of those nights were they weren't hitting it real hard. There 
were lots of rollers. . . . I felt like I did what I needed to do, and it was 
great to see Mike get his first big league win. I remember my first one, in 
1986." 
</P>
<P>
Finley seemed likely to collect his 12th victory after the Angels provided him 
a run in the first inning and two more in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Luis Polonia led off the game with a triple into the right-field corner, and he 
scored on Max Venable's sacrifice fly to center. The lead grew to 3-0 in the 
fourth inning when second baseman Johnny Ray, who entered the game with 11 hits 
in his previous 22 at-bats, got his first of two hits Saturday with a single to 
right field with one out. Lance Parrish followed that by smashing a 2-and-1 
pitch into the left-field seats for his 16th home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee cut that lead to 3-2 in the fifth inning, stirring first when Rob 
Deer led off with a 425-foot blast into the left-field seats. "He just crunched 
it," Finley said. "He got it up and out. I challenged him and he hit it. But it 
don't matter how far it went, it's still only one run." 
</P>
<P>
But the Brewers scored another in that inning when Jim Gantner singled to 
center, stole second and scored when Gary Sheffield hit a liner to left that 
hopped over the glove of Polonia for a triple. Finley ended the inning by 
inducing Robin Yount to pop to second. 
</P>
<P>
Pete O'Brien, the eighth hitter in the Brewers' lineup, started the 
seventh-inning rally that tied the game, 3-3. He singled to left, moved to 
second on a well-executed sacrifice by Bill Spiers and, after Gantner struck 
out, scored on Sheffield's double to left. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers put a runner in scoring position in the 10th inning when Deer 
reached on an infield single and moved up on O'Brien's sacrifice, but Fetters 
was able to bear down and retire Spiers on a fly to left and Gantner on a 
grounder to the right side. 
</P>
<P>
A 10th-inning Brewer threat was thwarted when Dave Parker was stranded on 
second base after a double. 
</P>
<P>
"After being swept in Toronto, coming here and winning the first two is really 
big," said Fetters, who was promoted from triple-A Edmonton on May 18 after 
Finley had sprained his left ankle and had to miss a start in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking forward to getting in tonight -- well, I was looking forward to 
Chuck getting a nine-inning victory, but I'm glad I could get my first one." 
</P>
<P>
Howell has taken heart from the Angels' 16-inning victory Friday and the 
comparatively brief win Saturday, which leaves them 5-4 in extra-inning games. 
</P>
<P>
"It would definitely be nice to sweep this series right before the (All-Star) 
break," he said. "It would give us a really good feeling going into those two 
days off."

After all the time Jack howell spent in the batting cage, the hours of 
listening to hitting instructor Deron Johnson and experimenting with different 
stances under the eyes of Johnson and teammate Dave Winfield, hitting the home 
run that gave the Angels their second consecutive extra-inning victory Saturday 
brought extra satisfaction.

NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
* Record Pace: The Toronto Blue Jays had drawn 2,139,313 through 46 dates, an 
average of 46,507, which projects to 3,767,058, a total that would break the 
Dodgers' major league record of 3,608,881, set in 1982. The Dodgers would argue 
that they sold more than 3.8 million tickets that year, but the National 
League's announced totals include only turnstile admissions. The American 
League announces total sales, including no-shows. On the other hand, the Blue 
Jays would argue that the Dodgers' 3.6-million turnstile total of '82 includes 
complimentary admissions. Toronto, through Thursday, had 23 consecutive 
sellouts and 80 in 110 dates since the SkyDome opened last summer. 
</P>
<P>
* Expo Express: The Montreal Expos remained within striking distance in the 
National League East while waiting for the return Thursday of rookie Delino 
DeShields, who has 23 stolen bases and will have missed 22 games because of a 
broken finger. The Expos were 9-10 through the first 19 of those games, 
stealing only 11 bases after stealing 111 in their first 62 games. On the 
absence of DeShields, Tim Raines said, "We stopped getting the cheap runs where 
he would walk, steal second, ground ball, ground ball and we'd be up a run." 
</P>
<P>
* Road Blues: The Houston Astros' 10-33 road record includes a 4-30 mark since 
May 5, and an 8-23 mark and a 5.56 earned-run average by the starting pitchers 
-- contrasted with the starters' 11-13 record and 2.35 ERA at home. Of the 64 
home runs the Astros have permitted, 17 have been hit by the New York Mets in 
only six games at Shea Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
* The Hit (&amp; Miss) Man: The New York Yankees' Don Mattingly, who averaged 
.309 in his six previous Junes, batted only .216 in June this year, his worst 
month since hitting .205 in September of 1983. Mattingly, through Thursday, was 
batting .253 with no home runs in his last 159 at-bats. "I'm done listening and 
talking," he said. "The doorman, the groundskeeper, everyone wants to tell me 
why I'm not hitting." 
</P>
<P>
* No Explanation: The six no-hitters of the first half don't figure, 
particularly since home runs, through June, increased 21% compared to last 
season, the per-game run total had increased from 8.3 to 8.7 and the cumulative 
major league batting average had risen from .255 to .260. "Offense is up and 
no-hitters are up," Texas pitching coach Tom House said. "Those are mutually 
exclusive facts, and all it tells you is that it is illogical." ROSS NEWHAN

<P>
At the All-Star break of a lockout season, these are the keys to the kingdom: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AMERICAN LEAGUE WEST 
</P>
<P>
With all of their other assets, the Oakland Athletics still seem to need a 
physically sound Jose Canseco. The A's were 8-9 and scored three or fewer runs 
10 times when Canseco was out of the lineup in June. 
</P>
<P>
His absence accentuates a lack of productivity by the designated hitters, but 
with him, the A's could wrap up a third consecutive division title by 
mid-August, because they play 17 of their first 20 games after the break and 26 
of their first 33 at home, where they are 21-14. 
</P>
<P>
A return to form by Mike Moore could make it easy. A 19-game winner last year, 
Moore is 7-7 and has been unable to get his fastball much above 80 m.p.h. for 
most of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago White Sox have held on doggedly, but only catcher Carlton Fisk is 
accustomed to pennant pressure, and one wonders how many times Manager Jeff 
Torborg can juggle his bullpen mirrors before they crack. 
</P>
<P>
White Sox relief pitchers made a numbing 193 appearances through 75 games, 
averaging 3 2/3 innings a game while working 36% of the staff's total. The 
relievers' 20-8 record, parlayed with Bobby Thigpen's 26 saves, reflects the 
bullpen's importance to Torborg, but a yield of seven or more runs three times 
in the last week of the first half may be a more relevant statistic now. 
</P>
<P>
Probable Finish: 1 -- Oakland, 2 -- Seattle, 3 -- Chicago, 4 -- Kansas City, 5 
-- Minnesota, 6 -- Texas, 7 -- Angels. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AMERICAN LEAGUE EAST 
</P>
<P>
New England title hopes hinge primarily on the ability of Roger Clemens, who is 
12-4; Mike Boddicker, 11-4; and Greg Harris, 6-3, to remain injury-free. Boston 
has tried six other starters in the fourth and fifth spots in the rotation and 
they are a combined 5-10. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors persist that the Red Sox are willing to trade Mike Greenwell, who has 
not hit a home run on the road in nearly a year and hit his only two homers of 
this year on April 27, to the Atlanta Braves for a young pitcher; but, barring 
a trade, the Boston staff consists primarily of the three starters and closer 
Jeff Reardon, sidelined twice in the first half because of injuries and used 
five times in one recent six-game span by Manager Joe Morgan, prompting the 
ESPN analyst of the same name to tell his audience, "It wasn't me folks." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan's managing aside -- the truth is, the Red Sox only thought about asking 
American League President Bobby Brown to extend their manager's recent 
suspension -- the Red Sox will enter the second half believing they can 
dominate their Eastern rivals, against whom they are 25-12, and dominate anyone 
at home, where they are 28-13 with 40 games remaining in Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto, by contrast, has only 32 games left at home and 44 on the road. A team 
that leads the league in scoring, the Blue Jays should also boast the deepest 
and best starting staff, but their performance has been enigmatic. 
</P>
<P>
At various times in the first half, the Blue Jays lost six of eight, nine of 10 
and six in a row, the starters compiling a 5.91 earned-run average in those 
spells. Then there were surges of five consecutive victories, 10 of 11, seven 
of nine and eight of 10, when the ERA was 3.25. 
</P>
<P>
If Dave Stieb, Todd Stottlemyre, David Wells, Jimmy Key and John Cerutti ever 
maintain one of those rolls -- as they have the ability to do -- the race could 
be reversed in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
Probable Finish: 1 -- Toronto, 2 -- Boston, 3 -- Milwaukee, 4 -- Cleveland, 5 
-- Detroit, 6 -- Baltimore, 7 -- New York. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NATIONAL LEAGUE WEST 
</P>
<P>
There doesn't seem to be any way the Cincinnati Reds can blow it. Although Eric 
Davis, who missed 22 first-half games with injuries, has yet to find his 
groove, the regular lineup includes six players with 28 or more runs batted in, 
six with batting averages of .280 or higher and three with 20 or more stolen 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
They have depth on the bench and in the bullpen. And with a 22-10 home record, 
they get 49 of their final 83 games there. The one question is the depth of the 
rotation. Jose Rijo is again sidelined because of a shoulder injury, and 
replacement Scott Scudder has been hit hard. Rick Mahler has been mediocre 
since replacing the traded Ron Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
However, Jack Armstrong and Tom Browning are a combined 19-8, and Danny Jackson 
has permitted only six earned runs in the 24 2/3 innings of his last four 
starts, the struggle to recover from his arm injury of 1989 apparently behind 
him. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds have several other factors going for them, specifically the 
underachieving San Diego Padres, the mediocre Dodgers and the defending 
champion San Francisco Giants, who post the best lineup among these alleged 
contenders but are still trying to cope with pitching injuries. 
</P>
<P>
If the basically rookie duo of John Burkett and Trevor Wilson, who had 12 of 
the Giants' 41 victories entering the final weekend of the first half, can 
continue to stabilize the riddled rotation, and sophomore Jeff Brantley can 
provide the consistent relief that Steve Bedrosian hasn't provided, San 
Francisco might still be a threat, but it's a tall order. 
</P>
<P>
Probable Finish: 1 -- Cincinnati, 2 -- San Francisco, 3 -- Dodgers, 4 -- San 
Diego, 5 -- Atlanta, 6 -- Houston. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NATIONAL LEAGUE EAST 
</P>
<P>
The New York Mets' ongoing roll under new Manager Bud Harrelson tends to cloud 
the fact that the Pittsburgh Pirates' lineup is just as formidable and, 
position by position, maybe superior. 
</P>
<P>
What separates the two is the proven quality and quantity of the Mets' 
rotation. Who do you like: Dwight Gooden, Frank Viola, David Cone, Sid 
Fernandez and Bob Ojeda; or Neal Heaton, John Smiley, Doug Drabek, Bob Walk and 
Walt Terrell? Fernandez has missed two recent starts because of a shoulder 
problem, but Ron Darling, while unhappy with his uncertain role, has stepped in 
to pitch effectively. 
</P>
<P>
That edge gives the Mets a better chance to sustain a streak or stop a slump, 
but the Pirates have an edge of their own. They are 23-10 at home and play 48 
of their 81 second-half games there. 
</P>
<P>
The Mets must play 47 of their last 85 on the road, where they were 17-17 
entering Saturday night's game at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Probable Finish: 1 -- New York, 2 -- Pittsburgh, 3 -- Montreal, 4 -- Chicago, 5 
-- Philadelphia, 6 -- St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
At some point in the next few days, weeks or months, Angel owner Gene Autry 
will place a call to Whitey Herzog, who resigned Friday as manager of the St. 
Louis Cardinals. Autry has long been an admirer of Herzog's. 
</P>
<P>
Reached Friday, shortly after Herzog announced his resignation, Autry said: "I 
think a lot of Whitey. He's a fine man and fine manager. I will probably touch 
base with him at some point, but I'm not going to call until he has had a 
chance to sit back and get a hold on his emotions." 
</P>
<P>
The hiring of Herzog in a field or developmental capacity would be a wise move 
by the Angels. Autry once had him under contract, but let him slip away. 
</P>
<P>
Herzog coached for the Angels in 1974, during the great Bobby Winkles 
experiment, when then-General Manager Harry Dalton hired Winkles directly off 
the Arizona State campus. 
</P>
<P>
When Winkles was fired during the season, Herzog served briefly as interim 
manager before the hiring of Dick Williams. At the end of that season, Herzog 
left to become manager of the Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably should have hired Whitey as manager instead of Williams," Autry 
said Friday. "That's probably one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made. 
Williams came in and didn't do any better than Winkles had. Whitey went on to 
become one of the best managers in baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Autry insisted that he isn't thinking of a change in his managerial or 
front-office ranks, but merely voicing respect for Herzog. 
</P>
<P>
"Our hitters have gone cold right now," he said, "but Doug Rader is doing a 
good job. I can't fault the manager for our position."

<P>
ANOTHER 4-0 ONE-HITTER IN DETROIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER

<TEXT>
<P>
If last weekend was the time for no-hitters, this is the weekend for 
one-hitters. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Appier, a 22-year-old right-hander from Antelope Valley, Saturday night 
made it two consecutive 4-0 one-hitters at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
The Kansas City rookie wasn't as close to perfect as the Tigers' Jack Morris 
had been Friday night, but he turned in a magnificent performance in the 
Royals' 4-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Morris have given up a single to Kurt Stillwell, the second batter he faced, 
then was perfect the rest of the 4-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Appier, in his ninth start since joining the rotation in late May, gave up a 
leadoff single to Lou Whitaker. Except for four walks, he matched Morris. 
</P>
<P>
Stillwell didn't have the only Kansas City hit in this game, but he had the big 
one. His bases-loaded single in the third inning drove in two runs and gave 
Appier all he needed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of spooky to have the same kind of games two nights in a row," 
Kansas City Manager John Wathan said. "But Kevin pitched a great game. He had 
all his pitches working. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't have the control Morris had, but otherwise he was just as great. He 
has been one of our most consistent pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
Appier has a 4-3 record, and the Royals expect big things of him. He was born 
in Lancaster and went to Antelope Valley High School, Antelope Valley College 
and Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
The Royals brought him up late last season, which he finished with a 1-4 record 
and a 9.14 earned-run average, but the Royals, who had made him the ninth 
player selected in the 1987 June draft, knew he was a prospect. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I had good stuff," Appier said. "I walked some guys but, fortunately, 
I worked out of those situations. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what I did, but it hasn't hit me yet. I'm not awed. I expect so much of 
myself that I'm never awed by myself. I'm a perfectionist. A lot of people in 
my family are the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Texas 7, Boston 4 -- With Mike Boddicker and Nolan Ryan on the mound at 
Arlington, Tex., this game had figured to be a pitchers' duel. 
</P>
<P>
But Boddicker (11-4), who had won 10 games in a row, couldn't make it through 
the sixth inning, while Ryan made it through seven to get his 297th victory. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan (8-4) settled after giving up three runs in the first inning. He struck 
out 12. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Incaviglia hit two home runs, and Ruben Sierra had another as the Rangers 
battled back from the 3-0 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
With Boddicker not at his best, the Red Sox lost their third game in a row, and 
their lead in the East -- which was 4 1/2 games several days ago -- was cut to 
a half-game over Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 1, Oakland 0 -- Less than 24 hours after they had hammered seven home 
runs in the second game of a doubleheader at Cleveland, the Athletics couldn't 
touch Bud Black. 
</P>
<P>
The left-hander held the predominantly right-handed-hitting A's to two singles. 
He retired the first 13 and the last 11 batters he faced. During the interim, 
Rickey Henderson and Carney Lansford got the hits. 
</P>
<P>
Curt Young (4-3) also pitched well. But Chris James singled home a run in the 
fourth inning, and with Black in top form, that was the game for the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the A's lineup -- Jose Canseco, Mark McGwire and Dave Henderson -- 
went 0 for 10. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 4, Chicago 1 -- Tim Hulett tripled in two runs, and John Mitchell 
picked up his first victory in almost three years in this game at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who had last won on Aug. 5, 1987 when he was with the New York Mets, 
held the White Sox to seven hits in eight innings. Gregg Olson pitched a 
perfect ninth to keep the White Sox from increasing their lead in the West. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 4, Seattle 2 -- With Jimmy Key returning to form and joining David 
Wells and Dave Stieb to give the Blue Jays excellent pitching, Toronto seems 
ready for a second-half drive. 
</P>
<P>
Key, hit hard in his two previous starts, held the Mariners to three hits in 
seven innings at Toronto, and the Blue Jays won their fifth game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Key gave up a two-run home run to Jeffrey Leonard in the first inning and was 
almost perfect after that. 
</P>
<P>
George Bell drove in three runs, including two on a first-inning single. 
</P>
<P>
Duane Ward pitched two hitless innings to get his seventh save. 
</P>
<P>
New York 5, Minnesota 4 -- Seldom-used utility infielder Wayne Tolleson singled 
with two out in the 12th inning at New York, then scored the winning run on 
Roberto Kelley's single to left field. DAN HAFNER

FRIENDS USE STICKBALL AS A TIME MACHINE; 
</P>
<P>
TRADITION: IT'S MORE THAN A GAME FOR TRANSPLANTED NEW YORKERS. IT'S A WAY TO 
RELIVE THEIR YOUTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
From a distance, they looked like kids choosing sides for a pickup game. They 
wore high-topped sneakers and stretched T-shirts, smiled at their girls and 
blew bubblegum, spit at insects and even let out an, "Ah, shoot," every once in 
a while. 
</P>
<P>
Up close, however, their graying beards and receding hairlines betrayed them. 
</P>
<P>
In a nostalgic return to friendships shared in an era of the Brooklyn Dodgers 
and Mickey Mantle, a group of ex-New Yorkers who have since moved to California 
uphold a Brooklyn sporting tradition every Fourth of July called stickball, in 
an annual Brooklyn-West "Stickball Classic." 
</P>
<P>
The group, which plays the game on Drexel Street, in Los Angeles, is a settled 
mix of successful entrepreneurs and family men, returning to childhood one day 
a year in remembrance of how it once was, and in celebration of what they have 
become. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, it's as though those childhood days were yesterday," said Sy Zagha, 
one of the game's longtime supporters. "You don't see some of these people for 
five, 10 or 15 years. But you're still old friends. There's a certain feeling 
that you don't lose." 
</P>
<P>
After high school, most went their own way -- some into business, others to the 
military -- and most of them are married. But each, for various reasons left 
Brooklyn and moved to California. 
</P>
<P>
Having kept in touch by telephone or at holiday gatherings, 25 years ago they 
decided to organize their first Fourth of July picnic and stickball game to get 
together. 
</P>
<P>
Like kids playing on a warm summer afternoon, there was no homework, no stock 
analysis, no late shipments, just a game . . . like in the old days. 
</P>
<P>
That afternoon was the beginning of an annual event that has been bringing the 
group together for more than two decades, and attracting some ex-New Yorkers 
from as far away as San Francisco to take part in the event. 
</P>
<P>
In 1978, the group began handing out an award to the player voted "most 
improved performer." The award, a tattered pair of 1978 Dodgers vs. Reds 
tickets, went to Bill Marin this year. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like an honor winning this award," Marin said. "It's like entering the 
Hall of Fame. I am now a part of the history of this event, which will continue 
for years." 
</P>
<P>
The game also serves as a gathering for friends and family members but 
eventually evolves into a melange of story-telling and joke-swapping. 
</P>
<P>
Irving Eskenazi, who is the host of the event, said: "We see each other at 
other times during the year.But this event is a chance to get together and just 
have fun. Now that the kids are getting older, we're starting to pass the 
tradition to them. That makes it kind of special." 
</P>
<P>
The tradition has been passed to people outside the original group, as well. 
</P>
<P>
Marin, who was born in Ecuador, said: "I was raised in L.A. and worked for Irv 
(Eskenazi) in the record business. Every night I would work late with him, and 
he would tell stories about what it was like in New York when he was growing 
up. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd explain the game of stickball and tell me how many manholes you had to 
hit for a home run and about the pitching and how they'd get their bats and 
about Coney Island hotdogs. And as the story went, everything seemed so 
exciting about growing up then, especially the stickball games. 
</P>
<P>
"So my first time here, I felt like I had just broken into the minors. It's 
really an event." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the kind words and inviting smiles, the game takes on a character of 
its own. Whether a ball is ruled fair or foul is of paramount importance, often 
bringing about vociferous protests and a reclarification of the rules. 
</P>
<P>
If you didn't know better, you'd think they were kids. 
</P>
<P>
"You're trying to grow at work and advance in your (professional) field all the 
time," Marin said. "But for that one day, I can be competitive athletically and 
I want to win desperately, even if it's just a game. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll argue over a ball being foul or fair, but not for the money or fame. 
It's not going to cost us our jobs or our livelihoods. We do it purely for the 
sake of winning. In that sense, it's like being a kid again." 
</P>
<P>
Since "the old days" is what this event is all about, the stories abound . . . 
</P>
<P>
The time was the early 1950s. The location, 67th Street and 20th Avenue in 
Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
It was a place where kids named Blackie and Chickie and Natie walked the 
streets swapping stories about baseball idols and plans for a trip to Coney 
Island. The neighborhood, most recently in the news for the gang slaying of a 
black youth, was made up mainly of stucco row houses and tiny back yards. 
</P>
<P>
Every morning, you could hear the shuffle of feet leaving the breakfast table 
and the familiar "whack" of the screen door as kids streamed into the streets 
to organize the day's games. 
</P>
<P>
A ratty-looking group in white T-shirts and long pants, they'd scour the 
neighborhood, stopping at each porch stoop just long enough to swipe a 
neighbor's mop or broom. 
</P>
<P>
Quickly stripped of its brush end, the broom became a sturdy stickball bat that 
might last several days. 
</P>
<P>
"We were pretty quick then," said Lenny Pinto, rubbing his belly and laughing. 
"Then some old lady would figure it out and start screaming, 'They've got my 
broom.' 
</P>
<P>
"Once we got a bat, we'd need some money for a ball. So, we'd look around for 
Pepsi-Cola bottles and cash them for two cents and the large bottles for a 
nickel." 
</P>
<P>
Often, they could play six or more games a day. And by supper, it had become a 
community event. 
</P>
<P>
"When our fathers would come home, they'd sit on the stoop and watch the game. 
. . . The wives would call out, 'Tom, Harry, John, ya coming for dinner?' 
They'd say, 'We're watching the kids, we'll eat later.' And then the whole 
neighborhood would come out to watch the game," Pinto said. 
</P>
<P>
"The sewer was home plate, and since there were four sewers on a block, you 
could have four games going at one time."

Joseph Shaber, one of the game's organizers, said that without television or 
video games, large families improvised their entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"There might be 20 families in a building, each with six kids, which was normal 
back then. It was different, everybody knew everybody, and neighbors were 
tighter. When everyone came out, you'd start playing the games, and you could 
just fill the streets with people." 
</P>
<P>
But as this day in 1990 came to an end, the "kids" reluctantly returned to 
their duties as fathers and grandfathers and businessmen. And with their day of 
remembrance finally over, their bodies tired and stiff, they left the streets 
once again, still muttering about a solid hit or a tough pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Those were the days . . .

GOLF ROUNDUP;

<P>
WADKINS INCREASES LEAD TO 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twenty years after losing to Lanny Wadkins as an amateur, Curtis Strange gets a 
shot at revenge today in Williamsburg, Va. And this time there's $180,000 on 
the line. And it's on Strange's home course. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good front-runner, he's a tough competitor and he's got a lot of guts," 
Strange said. "But I've got my share, too. It ought to be fun." 
</P>
<P>
Strange has ground to make up. On Saturday, Wadkins used three birdie surges to 
shoot a four-under-par 67 that gave him a three-stroke lead over Strange going 
into the final round of the Anheuser-Busch Golf Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Wadkins, a native of nearby Richmond, made consecutive birdies at three 
different stages of his round at the Kingsmill Golf Club. He also had two 
bogeys which left him at 15-under-par 198 for the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Strange, who was born in nearby Norfolk, chipped in from the fringe on the 
par-four 18th for a birdie. His 68 put him at 12-under 201. 
</P>
<P>
Because Wadkins is 40 and Strange is 35, they didn't meet often as amateurs. 
But Strange recalled that Wadkins did beat him in the semifinals of the 1970 
Virginia Amateur. 
</P>
<P>
"I was always kind of right behind Lanny," Strange said. "Lanny and I have 
become friends -- very good friends." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to sharing a home state, Strange followed Wadkins in college golf 
at Wake Forest. But Wadkins tried to downplay the parallels between himself and 
Strange, whose 17 victories include two U.S. Opens. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a tough competitor. He's capable of playing better than anyone," said 
Wadkins, who is seeking his 19th career title. 
</P>
<P>
Betsy King is leading the Jamie Farr Toledo Classic, although you'd never know 
it to listen to her talk. 
</P>
<P>
"I should have quit after the front nine," she said after shooting a 
one-under-par 70 for a one-stroke lead over Chris Johnson and Tina Purtzer 
heading into today's final round. 
</P>
<P>
King is at four-under-par 138 through 36 holes. She built a two-stroke lead 
with three consecutive birdies, then came back after dropping three shots to 
par by making a 15-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole. 
</P>
<P>
George Archer ignored back problems while shooting a five-under-par 67, 
building a two-shot lead over Frank Beard, Homero Blancas and Charles Coody 
after two rounds of the senior tour Northville Long Island Classic at Jericho, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Archer, who began the day two strokes behind first-round leader Gary Player, 
used an eagle on the par-five 10th hole and a birdie on No. 11 to build a 
four-stroke margin. But bogeys on Nos. 13 and 16 pulled him back to the field 
at 136, eight shots under par.

MERRIFIELD DESERVES PRAISE FOR ROLE AT PIC 'N' SAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While overall we felt that your June 23 story "Can This Guy Really Run a Big 
Bargain Basement?" was a fair and accurate portrayal of both the state of Pic 
'N' Save and its chairman, Lew Merrifield, there are three statements that we 
feel require clarification. 
</P>
<P>
The statement by Edward Randolph, a supplier to close-out stores and former Pic 
'N' Save shareholder, that "the stores are too pretty" indicates a lack of 
understanding of the present state of the close-out industry. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, close-out retailers could operate out of substandard stores, 
with goods piled on slabs of plywood atop sawhorses. Today's customer, however, 
demands more. Competition is greater for discount shoppers' dollars; time is an 
increasingly precious commodity. 
</P>
<P>
The statement by "an industry observer who asked not to be identified" that Mr. 
Merrifield seems to lack "an extra gene that merchants are born with" is 
ludicrous. We may not know about genes, but we do know about retailing. Lew 
Merrifield is among the best retailing executives that any of us have ever had 
the privilege to work with. 
</P>
<P>
The last statement from an industry analyst that Pic 'N' Save's expansion has 
failed is just not true. In fact, the stores that are performing best are our 
newest stores. We are pleased to say that this year, sales to date are up 18.5% 
for all stores and 5.7% on a comparable store basis. 
</P>
<P>
Lew Merrifield dragged Pic 'N' Save kicking and screaming into the 1990s. The 
company and its employees, including the undersigned, are all better for it.

WITH NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE, WORKERS COULD CHANGE JOBS WITHOUT LOSING 
BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One benefit of national health insurance that David M. Gordon ("National Health 
Insurance Would Be Cost-Effective," June 17) failed to mention is its 
portability from employer to employer. Our current system provides health 
insurance, pensions and similar programs on a company-by-company basis. 
</P>
<P>
When employees change jobs they often discover that significant benefit losses 
are entailed. 
</P>
<P>
For example, at a new job an employee may discover that his or her previously 
insured medical conditions (or those of dependents) are not covered because 
they are "pre-existing." Pension formulas are often arranged to penalize 
employees who leave in mid-career. The contrast with Social Security is 
obvious; under that national system employees can change jobs without any loss 
of coverage. It is 100% portable. 
</P>
<P>
The concern over rising health costs creates an opportunity for re-examining 
the decentralized, duplicative and mobility-inhibiting benefit system created 
by the tax code. That system reflects a bygone era of large, secure employers, 
long-term careers and economic stability. But in the modern world, many forces 
have combined to make job changes, both voluntary and involuntary, commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
Benefit programs that are not 100% portable deserve no tax subsidy.

David M. Gordon should glance farther east in Europe than Britain for examples 
of what "more equitable" truly means in regard to health care or any other good 
or service. More equitable really means burdening taxation, fewer choices and 
lower quality. 
</P>
<P>
I'm amazed that while many countries are throwing off the chains of state-run 
governments, an American economist calls for the world's leading example of 
economic and political liberty to follow a path to socialism.

BALEARIC ISLANDS LURE THOSE WHO SEEK THE BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. LISA BEEBE, Beebe is a free-lance writer living in New York City. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
PALMA, Majorca 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A journey to an island is a quest for the best: the softest sand, the clearest 
water, the longest beach, the best snorkeling, the finest sunset, the most 
stunning view, the best buys, the best hotels, and, ultimately, the best place 
to get away from all the other seekers of superlatives. 
</P>
<P>
Although Spain's Balearic Islands (Majorca, Ibiza, Formentera, and Minorca), 
stretching from Barcelona to Valencia along the country's Mediterranean coast, 
have earned a reputation for homogenized mass tourism, the overbuilt areas are 
easily avoided. 
</P>
<P>
While the bronzed masses lie end to end beneath the sun of Palma de Majorca and 
the surrounding beaches of the southern shore, many of Majorca's bests await to 
the north and west. 
</P>
<P>
Along the western coast, cliffs plunging into aquamarine waters form intimate 
coves. Most striking among them is Cala Sa Calobra. 
</P>
<P>
If you approach it from the inland city of Soller, you'll pass the island's 
tallest mountain, Puig Mayor (4,750 feet) amidst the Sierra de Tramontana, a 
Mediterranean rendition of the Alps, where white rock instead of snow marks the 
area above the tree line. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing north, you'll come to two of my favorite Majorca hang-outs, Puerto 
de Pollensa and the Formentor Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
The former is a broad, gently curving bay filled with the island's clearest, 
cleanest water and rimmed with its softest, whitest sands. 
</P>
<P>
Still free of the high-rise eyesores that plague the southern coast, Puerto de 
Pollensa's smaller, more intimate hotels are both lively and lovely. 
</P>
<P>
My favorite is the Hotel Illa d'Or, a vivid, white presence with a certain 
colonial charm (request a room in the old wing). 
</P>
<P>
Still largely undeveloped is the Formentor Peninsula linked to Puerto Pollensa 
by a 12-mile road that winds vertiginously among vistas of sands, forests, 
cliffs and water so turquoise it seems painted fresh daily. 
</P>
<P>
About halfway between Puerto Pollensa and the lighthouse at Cabo Formentor is 
the Hotel Formentor, the peninsula's sole lodging and Majorca's finest. 
</P>
<P>
Not all of the island's splendors are by the sea, however. The mountain village 
of Deya is pure visual poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Winsome and small (there are but two museums, a church and a handful of cafes, 
bars, restaurants, boutiques and art galleries), it is Majorca's prettiest 
village and has long been a refuge for soul-searching artists and writers. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Graves, author of "I, Claudius" and numerous other books, lived in Deya 
for 45 years and lies buried in the village cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
Nestled discreetly among Deya's hills is Majorca's second poshest hotel, La 
Residencia, a composite of two refurbished manor houses of the 14th and 16th 
centuries. It frequently welcomes such celebrities as Michael Douglas and Peter 
Bogdanovich. 
</P>
<P>
Back to the sea, my favorite beach is that long stretch of serenity known as 
Platja d'es Trenc, 25 miles southeast of Palma de Majorca. Not a single hotel 
mars this broad beach fringed with a pine forest and Cape Cod-like dunes. 
</P>
<P>
At one end are thatched beach umbrellas, lounge chairs, and a lone snack bar -- 
the only concessions to vacationing civilization as we know it. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end, it's just you and your towel. And in some cases that is 
literally true, as this secluded beach has long been a favored retreat for nude 
bathers. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there is no sunset like an island sunset, but not all island sunsets 
are created equal. Majorca's best is experienced over sundowners at the terrace 
bar of the Hotel Illa d'Or on Pollensa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
As the sun goes down in a blaze of amber-gold glory, the Mediterranean laps 
gently at your feet and the mountains crescendo from deep purple to inky black. 
</P>
<P>
Although a comparable sunset may be witnessed from the Hacienda, Ibiza's top 
hotel, life there finds its superlative moments at pool side. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel, a sybaritic retreat in the Moorish style, is situated on a tranquil 
promontory overlooking Na Xamena Bay, and has hosted such personalities as 
Goldie Hawn, Tony Roberts, and, in his more carefree days, Adnan Khashoggi. 
Guests gather several times a day around the ample pool where, weather 
permitting (and it almost always does), all meals are served. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the thick of touristic activity, Ibiza Town still exudes the 
uninhibited spirit of the '60s when the island was a hippie haven. 
</P>
<P>
Every evening the town's bars, shops, and restaurants swarm with provocative 
fashions and gravity-defying coifs. After midnight, the party continues at 
Pacha, Ku and Amnesia, the island's hottest, all-night discos. 
</P>
<P>
Since fashion is the island's second most important industry, Ibiza's boutiques 
are the best in the Baleares. Since the late '60s, a nonconformist fashion 
philosophy known as "ad lib" has evolved here. 
</P>
<P>
Rooted in the traditional attire of the island's natives and the natural, 
free-flowing garments of the hippies, Ibizan designs have in recent years 
become much more sophisticated. But their nonconformist spirit has not wavered. 
</P>
<P>
Indifferent to the fads of the moment, Ibiza's fashion philosophy is "Dress as 
you like, but show good taste," a motto coined by Smilja Mihailovitch, the 
Yugoslavian princess and longtime island resident who spearheaded the fashion 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the leading designer names to look for in Ibiza Town are Paula's, Tip 
Top, Maria M, Cantonada, Elena Deudero, John Charlie, Caty Mari, Lipstick and 
Bianca. 
</P>
<P>
Also in Ibiza Town is the Per eyra Jazz Club (a.k.a. La Cantina), the best 
music club in the Baleares where customers and music spill out onto the veranda 
Bourbon Street style. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ibiza offers over 100 beaches of varying sizes, shapes, and sexual 
persuasions (gay or nudist, for example), a mere half an hour away by hydrofoil 
are the beaches of Formentera, reputedly the best in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
The claim has some merit, and foremost among this small island's beaches is the 
Platja de Ses Illetas, a slender finger of land flanked on both side by beaches 
trailing soft and white into a blue-green sea sprinkled with sumptuous yachts. 
</P>
<P>
Those without a yacht must get there via a bumpy dirt road, but the experience 
is worth every bounce. 
</P>
<P>
Last but not the least of Ibiza's many charms is the elastic nature of time, 
which bends here to humans rather than the other way around. No need to make 
plans; things just happen. 
</P>
<P>
Shops and restaurants stay open as long as there are customers and close when 
there are no more. People come for a week's vacation and stay forever. It's 
just that easy to lose track of time. 
</P>
<P>
After staying on a few unplanned days myself, I finally pressed on to Minorca, 
the second- largest island in the Balearic chain. 
</P>
<P>
A relative newcomer to the tourist trade, it is less developed than its 
siblings, and some of its better beaches are accessible only by all-terrain 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
Those who make the trek, however, are rewarded with crystal clear waters and 
shimmering white sands. 
</P>
<P>
By far the island's most astonishing vista is that from the promontory at Cap 
de Cavalleria. Getting there is not easy, though. 
</P>
<P>
A long, dirt road (negotiable by car or motorbike) punctuated with gates 
closing off access to private lands jostles you through pretty countryside 
reminiscent of the Scottish Highlands. Don't let the gates deter you, though. 
</P>
<P>
Island custom is simply to open them, drive through, and close them again 
behind you. At the end of the road await a lighthouse and the best view in the 
Baleares -- a panorama of rolling hills and glorious cliffs ringed by a 
jewel-blue sea. 
</P>
<P>
Another Minorcan highlight is the tiny town of Fornells. Curled around a 
northern bay filled with boats and windsurfers, it is really little more than 
an assemblage of upscale restaurants and a smattering of chic shops grafted 
onto a fishing village. 
</P>
<P>
Its most notable commodities are the savory calderetas (rich soups/casseroles 
of fish, shellfish, or the local spiny lobster) that from time to time entice 
Spain's King Juan Carlos to sail in for a meal. He usually dines at Es Pla on 
the water's edge, but locals claim the calderetas at Es Cranc are the best. I 
can't disagree. 
</P>
<P>
While Majorca and Ibiza boast great sunsets, Minorca's celestial piece de 
resistance is the moon, which seems closer, bigger, and more commanding here, 
especially when full. 
</P>
<P>
One night, beneath the light of that extraordinary moon, I discovered the most 
unique nightspot in the Baleares, La Cava d'en Xoroi in Calan Porter. 
</P>
<P>
Embedded in a sheer cliff high above the sea, its bars and terraces occupy a 
series of caves and its dance floor extends to the cliff's edge. Beyond the 
railing . . . a superlatively dramatic drop to the sea.

How to get there: Iberia Airlines, Aviaco and Air Europa fly to the Balearic 
Islands from Madrid or Barcelona, which is only 30 minutes away. Flights and 
hotels are often hard to come by in the peak months of July and August, so book 
in advance.

In May, June, and September, the weather is still fine and there are fewer 
crowds.

PARIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You've done the Louvre marathon, you've swooned in front of the Musee d'Orsay's 
Renoirs and Van Goghs, and you've survived the grubby gantlet surrounding the 
Pompidou (Beaubourg). 
</P>
<P>
By now you've resigned yourself to the idea that the price of art in Paris is 
long lines and pushy crowds. 
</P>
<P>
What if someone were to tell you that there are museums in central Paris with 
magnificent collections, priceless masterpieces, and with average attendance 
figures in the double figures? That's 25 to 50 visitors. Per day. 
</P>
<P>
They do exist. And there are three of them within a few minutes' stroll of each 
other, just north of the Champs-Elysees. 
</P>
<P>
Each one offers a look at how a real person put together a collection of 
antiquities and art that was to be lived with and enjoyed every day in a home. 
</P>
<P>
Enter any one and you get to share that particular splendor that was Belle 
Epoque Paris, at the height of its power and self-confidence. And it's entirely 
possible you'll have the rooms to yourself. 
</P>
<P>
You can visit all three in a single tour but any one would make a fine morning 
or afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Musee Jacquemart-Andre: Set on the busy Boulevard Haussmann, the Musee 
Jacquemart-Andre has a rear entrance, curved to allow carriages to spiral up to 
the doorway. 
</P>
<P>
The once-spacious grounds have been taken over by office and residential 
buildings, but the house retains much of its character. 
</P>
<P>
Wealthy art lover Edouard Andre built the house in 1869 to house his already 
extensive collection of Renaissance bronzes and ceramics, Gobelins and Beauvais 
tapestries, 18th-Century furniture, and, his favorite, sculpture from 
16th-Century Italy and 17th-Century France. 
</P>
<P>
His marriage to the painter Nelie Jacquemart in 1881 was also a joining of 
artistic temperaments. Well-connected to political and artistic circles, she 
joined with her husband in searching out the finest art for their showplace 
home, combining her taste for 18th-Century paintings with his for the 
17th-Century. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the rooms on the ground floor have the lighthearted feel -- both 
frivolous and formal -- of the Louis XV furnishings that fill them. 
</P>
<P>
The mood is quickly set by two lovely and fleshy Boucher paintings in the first 
reception room. But the Grand Salon is the best expression of this 18th-Century 
sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
The cream and gilt paneling, taken from a house built in 1735, provide a 
beautiful backdrop for graceful furniture, carpets, porcelain and framed 
tapestries. 
</P>
<P>
The rooms to the east house an eclectic collection of tapestries, sculptures, 
and porcelains. Paintings include works by Fragonard, Reynolds, LeBrun, 
Watteau, Riisdael, Van Dyke, David, and Rembrandt ("Portrait of Dr. Tholleux" 
and an unusual "Le Pilgrim"), among many others. 
</P>
<P>
Passing back through the Grand Salon you enter the first Italian room. 
</P>
<P>
Two of my favorite pieces are here, side by side. The room contains a smashing 
Uccello, St. George slaying a delightfully sinuous dragon while a fair maid 
watches, almost indifferently. Next to it in an entirely different mood, is a 
stunning portrait by Mantegna of Christ flanked by his tormentors. 
</P>
<P>
Next door a room contains a famous Bernini bust of Pope Gregory XV, but it is 
the large Tiepolo mural filling the end of the room, that draws the eye. 
</P>
<P>
Ascending one of the dual, curved staircases to get closer to the fresco, you 
are led to the upper floor and Renaissance galleries filled with Italian 
treasures. Donatello provides two infant angels, while paintings by Sellaio, 
Bellini and others line the walls. 
</P>
<P>
Mme. Andre, on her death in 1912, bequeathed the house and its contents to the 
privately owned and operated Institut de France. It operates about 15 museums 
in Paris and other parts of France, including the Marmottan and the Chateau of 
Chantilly. 
</P>
<P>
Musee Nissim de Camondo: In 1911 Count Moise de Camondo began to fill his 
family's gracious 18th-Century home with fine furnishings and art, mostly from 
the 18th Century. His son Nissim, an aviator, was killed in World War I, and on 
the count's death in 1935 the home became a museum and a memorial to the lost 
heir. The count's surviving daughter, Beatrice, her husband and two children 
all died at Auschwitz. 
</P>
<P>
No hint of those dark days appears in the house. Passing through a charming, 
spacious entry, you ascend a grand stairway to the "first floor" and its three 
large, light-filled salons. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the excesses of the 18th Century, the times allowed a generation of 
artisans to produce objects of great beauty for a wealthy and appreciative 
aristocracy. 
</P>
<P>
The oval "Salon des Huet" is a particularly elegant example of that attention, 
with large pastoral paintings by Huet, fine furnishings, paneled walls and 
colorful carpets. Through the French windows on one side you look across a 
spacious terrace and formal gardens to the lovely Parc Monceau. It is not too 
hard to imagine yourself taking tea here surrounded by conversation and music. 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs are the family's private rooms. Nissim de Camondo's bedroom is as he 
left it in 1917. The furnishings of the count's bedroom are impressive and well 
worth a look. 
</P>
<P>
But the highlight of this floor is the grand salon, the "family room" of the 
house. One wall is filled with windows, filling the room with light and giving 
a pleasing view of the park. Again, the furniture is 18th Century, each piece 
with an impeccable pedigree, but each chosen for comfort that goes far beyond 
formality. 
</P>
<P>
This must have been a family that cherished its moments together. I was 
especially taken with one 19th-Century painting -- a view of the backs of six 
red-coated gentlemen, it is the antithesis of formal portraiture, and totally 
charming. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, this room impressed me so much the first time I saw it that I returned 
just to see it again and try to understand better the mind of Moise de Camondo, 
who so carefully and knowledgeably blended art and family life. 
</P>
<P>
Musee Cernuschi: Wealth and business brought the Italian financier Cernuschi, a 
friend of Garibaldi's, to Paris, where he built this house in the mid-1800s. 
The rigors of the Prussian siege of Paris in 1870 and the violence of the '71 
Commune drove him away from the capital. 
</P>
<P>
He traveled the world for three years and returned, determined to put together 
a collection of Oriental art, then little-known in the West. Arguably, the 
explosion of artistic expression at the end of the century in France can be 
traced to this influx of art from the East. 
</P>
<P>
As fine as the house is, it is the art that takes center stage here. The 
collection covers Chinese art from 3000 BC to the 13th Century and includes 
pottery, porcelain, painted silk, bronze statuary and paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Porcelain and terra-cotta funerary figures, the inescapably coquettish 
miniature courtesan, the priestly zodiacal figures -- each piece seems to 
vibrate with expression and depth. The celadon bowls and vases are perfect in 
shape and shimmering with rich glazes. 
</P>
<P>
Also there's the "Horses and Grooms" painted silk scroll. Acquired for the 
Cernuschi in 1956, it was found in a cave in 1900 and dates to the 8th Century 
(Tang Dynasty). It is one of the most stunning works I've ever seen and it 
alone is worth a trip to the Cernuschi. 
</P>
<P>
But there is more. The grand atrium staircase leads to the upper floor and a 
huge gallery built to contain a monumental bronze Buddha. The statue dominates 
but in no way diminishes the delicate pottery, porcelain and paintings that 
share the room. 
</P>
<P>
A section of the wall is hung with scrolls and a display of calligraphy is 
arranged chronologically to demonstrate its development. 
</P>
<P>
There are many other small museums in Paris that offer similar experiences. The 
Michelin Green Guide lists about 85. By seeking them out you gain not only the 
pleasure of discovering their various themes and treasures, but you will be led 
to discover for yourself more of the real Paris, where art and the art of 
living are to be found everywhere.

YOUTH BEAT: CHECK RAIL DISCOUNTS BEFORE GOING ON TRIP

<P>
If you are going to attend school overseas, with plans to travel afterward, you 
may be eligible for special discounts on train transportation, particularly 
those discounts that are not promoted and sold in North America. For your own 
benefit, do a little research. 
</P>
<P>
Europe-bound travelers under 26, for example, who will be residents in a 
country for more than six months, are eligible to buy one-month Inter-Rail 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
The passes offer a 50% reduction in the country of purchase, and unlimited free 
second-class transportation in 20 other countries from Britain to Morocco. 
Inquire at rail stations and travel agencies throughout Europe. They are now 
being sold for about $297 U.S. in France. 
</P>
<P>
An Inter-Rail card is also honored for reductions on some private Swiss 
railroads and several shipping services, in such areas as the North Sea, Irish 
Sea, across the English Channel, from Spain to Morocco, France to Corsica and 
Italy to Sardinia. 
</P>
<P>
It's also possible to purchase a version of the pass that includes some free 
sea travel, and one that includes some free sea travel and is also valid for 
any 10 days of travel within a single calendar month. The price is presently 
1,500 francs, about $285 U.S. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how to research the deals available in foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Check with the tourist information office of the countries you intend to 
visit. Most have representatives in North America. You can find them in your 
telephone directory or travel agents may have their addresses and phone 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Inquire at student travel agencies. They often have information about 
special point-to-point youth and student fares that are available through their 
affiliates in foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Check the guidebooks that are researched for independent, budget travelers. 
In a bookstore that specializes in travel publications, look for series such 
as: "Let's Go" (by Harvard Student Agencies); "Lonely Planet" (Moon 
Publications) or the 1990 (20th) edition of "Eurail Guide: How to Travel Europe 
and All the World by Train," by Kathryn and Marvin Saltzman. 
</P>
<P>
Although the bulk of information in the "Eurail Guide" is dedicated to Europe, 
it contains information on services and tickets in 141 countries. 
</P>
<P>
"The Eurail Guide" is also helpful with advice on popular sightseeing routes 
for train travelers, and warnings of potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
The "Eurail Guide: How to Travel Europe and the World by Train" is available in 
book stores for $12.95. 
</P>
<P>
It can also be ordered from the publisher for $14.45, which includes postage 
and handling. Write Eurail Guide, 27540 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu 90265.

<P>
With The World According to Garp (KCOP Sunday at 8 p.m.), writer Steve Tesich 
and director George Roy Hill try to hew to the heart of the sprawling, surreal 
John Irving novel, cherishing the fragility of life and illuminating the 
complicated existence of novelist T.S. Garp (a sweetly randy Robin Williams). 
However, the only person who seems more than a literary conceit is John 
Lithgow's dignified, poignant and funny transsexual who once played tight end 
for the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
Murder by Natural Causes (KTTV Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a terrific 1979 
made-for-TV thriller, written and produced by Richard Levinson and William 
Link, with Hal Holbrook and Katharine Ross starring. 
</P>
<P>
Murder: By Reason of Insanity (KTTV Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is a solid 1985 TV 
movie, directed by Anthony Page and starring Candice Bergen as a wife battered 
by a mental patient husband (Jurgen Prochnow). 
</P>
<P>
The Great Ice Rip-Off (KTTV Thursday at 8:30 p.m.) is niftyycaper comedy, a 
1974 TV movie that pits Lee J. Cobb's retired cop against Gig Young's jewel 
thief. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1987 Dolls (KCOP Friday at 8 p.m.), Stuart Gordon, whose first two films 
were imaginative and bloody H.P. Lovecraft adaptations, is more whimsical and 
lighthearted in this knowing trapped-in-a-dark-mansion-in-a-hideous rainstorm 
genre piece. 
</P>
<P>
Vincente Minnelli's 1952 The Bad and the Beautiful (KTLA Saturday at 8 p.m.) 
remains one of Hollywood's best commentaries on itself and is as memorable for 
its David Raksin score as it is for its stellar cast, headed by Kirk Douglas 
and Lana Turner. The KTLA telecast will be colorized. 
</P>
<P>
In Le Bonheur, Agnes Varda's superb, uncompromising 1965 film (KCET Saturday at 
10:35 p.m.), Varda asserts that only those who have the courage to follow their 
own natures and are willing to defy the artificial and stifling conventions of 
society can hope to achieve fulfillment in love. Jean-Claude Drouot stars. 
</P>
<P>
As in "Psycho," Curtis Hanson's 1987 The Bedroom Window (KCOP Saturday at 8 
p.m.), a pastiche about successively deeper layers of voyeurism, terror and 
guilt, takes us from adultery and deceit to murder and madness. It doesn't 
quite jell, but it's engrossing and has a fine cast headed by Steve Guttenberg, 
Isabelle Huppert and Elizabeth McGovern. 
</P>
<P>
The 1975 Cousin, Cousine (KCET Saturday at 9 p.m.) remains one of the most 
popular foreign films, a pleasant fantasy in which cousins by marriage embark 
upon an affair without thought for their spouses, who are unsympathetic anyway. 
</P>

Re-Animator Stuart Gordon's 1985 film of a 1922 H.P. Lovecraft story is a real 
throat-grabber, one of the best, funniest Grand Guignol horror pictures of the

madness and who is determined to conquer brain death. (2 hours) Edited. (KCOP

THE PADRES' SEASON IS HALF BAD AT BREAK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
You're Tom Werner. 
</P>
<P>
You can't believe this is happening. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, you felt a bit queasy about the Padres the day you officially became 
owner and heard on the radio that your All-Star catcher, Benito Santiago, 
suffered a broken left foreman and would be out for six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But how were you to know things would go this bad? 
</P>
<P>
How were you to know that the Padres would go into the tank, losing nine of 11 
games, and 17 of the past 24 games, dropping out of the pennant race by the 
All-Star break? 
</P>
<P>
How were you to know that your manager, Jack McKeon, would come to your office 
this past Monday and request to come upstairs as soon as possible and assume 
the sole job as vice/president baseball operations? 
</P>
<P>
How were you to know that most of your players are so outraged over the team's 
lackadaisical play that it's no longer fun for them to even come to the 
ballpark any more? You listen to them say: 
</P>
<P>
"We're dead, we're totally dead," Padre starter Dennis Rasmussen said. "It's 
like we're going through the motions. We don't have any fire. It's just like we 
sit there, waiting for something bad to happen. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a joke." 
</P>
<P>
Padre starter Bruce Hurst said: "Look at us, there's no emotion in here 
whatsoever. Guys come in here, put on their uniforms, throw their gloves on the 
field, and leave. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to be honest with you, it's tough seeing what's going on right now." 
</P>
<P>
Rasmussen and Hurst are among about a dozen players who are throughly disgusted 
with the Padres' carefree attitude. But after you and your partners talked with 
many of the players during last Sunday's team party, you've already gotten that 
inside scoop. 
</P>
<P>
And you thought you had troubles on the set of "Roseanne?" 
</P>
<P>
"Right now," you say, "I feel like my insides are being ripped out with every 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to be calmer with defeats. I'm very competitive personally, and this is 
very hard. I'm very frustrated as a fan, and owner, that we haven't seen them 
play to our potential." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, you think, you should have listened to friends and family who spent 
weeks trying to talk you out of this silly notion of buying the Padres. Now 
that you think back, the only one who was really in favor of you shelling out 
more than $20 million for the right to be chairman of the Padres was your 
13-year-old-son, Teddy. 
</P>
<P>
But you wouldn't listen, would you? You've always liked a challenge, and 
dammit, you were going to make this work. You could envision yourself on 
national TV, along with your 14 partners, accepting the World Series trophy 
from Fay Vincent. Man, this would be a bigger thrill than taking Cosby to the 
top of the charts. 
</P>
<P>
Now, you have this mess. 
</P>
<P>
You're thankful for a friend such as Russell Goldsmith, who went into this 
venture with you as one of three vice chairmen. You talk to Goldsmith daily, 
and together, try to soothe each other's fears. You discuss a plan of attack 
with each other to make this a first-class organization, but you'll go about 
this quietly, and slowly. 
</P>
<P>
There already are things that have caught your attention in the front office, 
and you're learning more and more each day about your employees. 
</P>
<P>
You remember the first day you toured your front office, looked around, and 
immediately thought to yourself how few blacks were among your 100 full-time 
employees. Incredibly, there is not a single black in a high-profile 
administrative position. This must change. 
</P>
<P>
You find it rather curious that one of your front office officials is a sports 
memorabilia collector. When Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser set the major league 
record two years ago at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium for pitching 59 scoreless 
innings, you've been told that that same official was on the field tearing out 
the pitching rubber for his own collection. That stuff belongs in Cooperstown, 
not in the basement of somebody's house. 
</P>
<P>
It's gotten so bad that your star player, Tony Gwynn, actually is shelling out 
his own money for bats this year. Instead of watching the bats being sold for 
$100 a pop in memorabilia stores, Gwynn makes sure his discarded bats go to 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
You've got another vice president who doesn't know how to keep score at 
baseball games. Really. You're still wondering what he does to fill his 40-hour 
work week. 
</P>
<P>
The president, Dick Freeman, you've decided, will stay. He not only has a 
contract through this year, but just a few months before you took over, an 
agreement was signed that will keep him on the payroll for about $225,000 
through 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman has assured you that the club will once again make money. Although 
attendance is declining because of the club's play, you're still on pace to 
sell 2.3 million tickets, the same amount as a year ago when the Padres made a 
franchise-record $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The break-even point is between 2 million and 2.1 million tickets, but you know 
that considering your payroll likely will increase by about $7 million next 
season, you'll need to sell about 2.5 million tickets to break even. 
</P>
<P>
You and your partners know the only way to increase attendance, and elevate the 
current full season-ticket base from 10,500, is to improve the product on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
You can make wholesale trades, as Jack McKeon, your manager and vice 
president/baseball operations, suggests. He already has told you about talks he 
has had with the Kansas City Royals, as recently as this week, about the 
possibility of acquiring reliever Mark Davis and either outfielder Bo Jackson 
or Danny Tartabull. It would cost you at least center fielder Joe Carter, and 
probably at least another player. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon is pushing hard for you to agree to take back Davis in a trade. You know 
all about Davis. He's the man who saved 44 games last year for the Padres, won 
a Cy Young award, turned down a four-year, $12 million contract with San Diego, 
signed with the Kansas City Royals for an extra million, and has flopped so 
badly that even the sedate fans of Kansas City are booing him unmercifully. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon and Pat Dobson, Padre pitching coach, have convinced you that that they 
could turn Davis around, but you're not about to take on a contract like that. 
Maybe if the Royals would eat about half of the contract, you might think about 
it, but you'd be the laughingstock of the industry to take him back with that 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of other moves that McKeon is considering. First baseman Jack 
Clark, who's making $2 million now and likely will receive a raise in 
arbitration this winter, is prime trade bait to an American League team. 
Starter Bruce Hurst could go in the right deal. And, heck, now that you think 
about it, the only players McKeon told you that are untouchable are starter 
Andy Benes, second baseman Roberto Alomar and catcher Benito Santiago. It's 
highly unlikely McKeon would ever trade All-Star outfielder Tony Gwynn because 
of the violent public reaction, but hey, if he was overwhelmed. . . . 
</P>
<P>
You listen in reverence as McKeon speaks. This man is legendary in the game of 
baseball with his wheeling and dealing. Nothing is sacred with him. When he 
gets bored, he'll even make imaginary trades involving other teams. 
</P>
<P>
"When we came in here and bought the club," you say, "amongst other things, we 
were buying the services of Jack McKeon. In my mind, Jack McKeon is the guy who 
can turn this around." 
</P>
<P>
You are optimistic because the Padres historically always wait until the second 
half to perform well. Why, under McKeon, the Padres have a .619 winning 
percentage (91-56) after the All-Star break the past two years. Of course, it 
never was good enough to win the division, but this is no time to get picky. 
</P>
<P>
Deep inside, though, you wonder if you're only kidding yourself in thinking 
that this team is capable of putting together such a run. You hardly consider 
yourself a baseball expert, but you've seen Pony League teams with better 
defense than this one. 
</P>
<P>
This defense is so bad that there already have been 44 errors among the quartet 
of shortstop Garry Templeton, second baseman Alomar, third baseman Mike 
Pagliarulo and center fielder Carter. And this doesn't even count the balls 
they don't reach. To put this feat in perspective, the San Francisco Giants' 
entire team has made only 46 errors. 
</P>
<P>
The bullpen duo of Craig Lefferts and Greg Harris are worn out. Of course, what 
do you expect when they've already made 71 appearances and have pitched in 111 
2/3 innings? 
</P>
<P>
The offense has been anemic. Of their 42 defeats this season, just 10 times 
have the Padres scored more than three runs. In fact, they've scored more than 
three runs in just two of their past 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
Is it really the team's fault, you wonder? Or it is the manager's? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, you told McKeon on Monday that he will stay downstairs as manager for the 
remainder of the season, but what you didn't say was that you're carefully 
monitoring the situation. Right now you're familiarizing yourself with top 
managerial candidates in the game, and have already heard plenty about Don 
Baylor of Milwaukee and Hal McRae of Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Why, just mention Baylor's name around former Red Sox players Calvin Schiraldi 
and Hurst, and they'll talk for hours how they respect him more than anyone in 
baseball. Mention McRae's name around George Brett, Frank White and Willie 
Wilson in Kansas City, and they'll tell you how their club might be different 
if he never had turned down the Royals' managerial job in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
There also are former managers floating around, such as Jim Fregosi of the St. 
Louis Cardinal organization, Hal Lanier of Philadelphia, Davey Johnson, 
formerly of the Mets, and Pat Corrales of Atlanta. And right here on your 
coaching staff you have Pat Dobson, who manages in the off-season in the Senior 
League, and Greg Riddoch, either of whom you could turn to as interim managers 
for the remainder of the season while you evaluate whether they're right for 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
And, oh, you couldn't help thinking Friday what a coup it would be to bring 
Whitey Herzog to San Diego as manager in 1991. Could you imagine a 1-2 punch of 
McKeon in the front office and Herzog on the field? And you thought Cosby and 
Roseanne were a powerful combo. 
</P>
<P>
Still, you want to be careful. This is going to be a very important decision in 
your regime, and one that could be instrumental in the future of your 
franchise. You're not about to let anyone force you into making a quick 
decision on this. 
</P>
<P>
For all you know, it could be impossible to ever have a winner again here. It's 
as if there's something in the air that makes people forget about playing 
baseball in San Diego. It is rather bizarre, isn't it, that third baseman Mike 
Schmidt and Herzog each announced their mid-season retirements with their teams 
in San Diego? 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, something is wrong with this team. You find it odd that the Padres 
actually are a much-better team on the road, 16-17, than at home, 21-25.. You 
find it odd that the team seldom takes infield before games, and extra-hitting 
always is optional. You find it odd that members of this team have lost track 
of how many outs there are in an inning, or the count, at least five times this 
season. And you find it odd that most of the players would like to see fines 
levied against themselves for mental blunders or violations of team rules. 
</P>
<P>
"A guy starts getting fines, and after a couple of times, it starts to sink 
in," Padre veteran Ed Whitson said. "That'll wake some guys up. It's not that 
tough seeing signs. It's not that tough to know how many outs there are in an 
inning. Hell, just turn around and look at the scoreboard. It's not that tough 
to follow rules around here." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, nothing is said, at least publicly in front of the players. At first, 
the lack of discipline began irritating some of the players to such a point 
where they called a team meeting in May in New York. They were going to police 
themselves. That worked for a while, but now, veterans say, the situation has 
deteriorated to a point of no-return. 
</P>
<P>
Why is it that one player was allowed to sit on the bench Tuesday against the 
Pittsburgh Pirates with only a sweat top on, and only went to get fully dressed 
when notified he would pinch-hit? Why is it that more and more players are not 
even bothering to stick around to watch the game any more, and retreat to the 
clubhouse when removed from the game? Why are players allowed to show up at the 
ballpark five minutes before batting practice without being publicly 
reprimanded? Why is it that players frequently are missing signs from 
third-base coach Sandy Alomar and first-base coach Amos Otis, sometimes to the 
point where the coaching staff wonders if it's done purposely? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe then, you begin to understand, you're taking these defeats much tougher 
than most of the players. Heck, with the exception of the usual three to four 
players night after night, the clubhouse empties faster than a firehouse on 
call. 
</P>
<P>
Now you know what Clark means when he says, "It's like we're all going 
different directions right now. We've got to get ourselves focused, and for 
whatever reason, that's just not happening." 
</P>
<P>
These days the only bond among the players is that they believe they have the 
talent to field a championship team. Oh, maybe it's too late to catch the 
Cincinnati Reds, but they know deep inside there's far too much talent in the 
clubhouse to be playing like this. Instead of shuffling players, they'd like to 
see a new approach by McKeon, or a new man sitting in his chair. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon has heard suggestions before, and stealing the line of his buddy, 
Chicago Cub Manager Don Zimmer, says, "How come last year I was a genius, and 
this year I'm a dummy.' I'm the same guy aren't I? 
</P>
<P>
"I can't pitch for the guys, or come up to the plate and hit the runner in. I'm 
doing everything I can, knocking my head against the wall for answers." 
</P>
<P>
It's now up to you to make the choice. Do you want to take the chance the 
Padres will jell in the second half under McKeon, and leave everything status 
quo? Do you want to bring McKeon into the front office immediately instead of 
waiting until the off-season, and let Dobson or Riddoch take a crack at the job 
on an interim basis, with the full understanding that you still might hire 
outside? Or do you want to immediately hire someone from another organization? 
</P>
<P>
The problems are just beginning, causing you to scratch your head trying to 
remember who the wise guy was who ever told you that it was going to be fun 
owning a major league baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
Oh yeah. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks a lot, Teddy. 
</P>
<P>
Remember the car you were promised on your 16th birthday, well, the way I'm 
feeling right now, that vehicle's going to be consisting of two wheels and 
spokes. 
</P>
<P>
But, uh, Ted, before you leave the house, you wouldn't have any ideas on 
managers, would you? 
</P>

JAMISON IS CALIFORNIA'S NEWEST REDWOOD; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: SIX-FOOT-11 UC BERKELEY-BOUND CENTER WILL TRY TO MAKE AN IMPACT IN 
FRESHMAN SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. A. ADANDE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ryan Jamison will never have to worry about being overlooked. After all, he is 
6 feet 11. 
</P>
<P>
For Jamison, a Mar Vista resident who is headed to UC Berkeley on a basketball 
scholarship, the question is how much will he contribute to the Golden Bears' 
quest for a Pacific 10 Conference title during the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
Jamison was the starting center at Loyola High for three years. He began as a 
cautious sophomore, surrounded by a senior-dominated lineup that handled the 
scoring duties. By his senior year, he blossomed into an All-CIF first-team 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
He set school career records for field goal percentage (61.6%), rebounds (714) 
and blocked shots (194). He averaged 18.9 points and 11.5 rebounds a game last 
season and set school season records for field goal percentage (65.3), rebounds 
(323) and blocked shots (89). He also set single-game records of 28 rebounds 
and 11 blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I think my progression has been in confidence," Jamison said. "As a sophomore, 
I could have played a lot better if I had confidence in myself." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Thomason, the boys' basketball coach at Loyola, saw a change in Jamison's 
physique as well as a more aggressive attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"He got stronger physically and took more responsibility for scoring and 
rebounding," Thomason said. "In his senior year, he was the player we'd look to 
for scoring. He was never a project, he simply had to get to the point where he 
felt he could be a force." 
</P>
<P>
Thomason noticed a major breakthrough in December when the team was playing in 
the Beach Ball Classic in Myrtle Beach, S.C. It faced Archbishop Shaw, the 
Louisiana state champions who were led by All-American center Melvin Simon. 
Early in the game, Jamison got the ball in the low post, faked, dribbled once 
and dunked over Simon. 
</P>
<P>
"It showed he knew his place, that he wasn't going to back off against 
anybody," Thomason said. "More than just the two points, it was the feeling he 
gave me of how far he had come since his sophomore year." 
</P>
<P>
Jamison will have to make even more progress if he wants to be a factor in the 
Pac-10. California Coach Lou Campanelli said he would like Jamison to add 25 
pounds to his current weight of 215. But he is willing to wait for Jamison to 
develop. 
</P>
<P>
"When we recruited Ryan, we were looking at a few years down the line," 
Campanelli said. "If he works hard he could be a fine player. He has good hands 
and a soft touch." 
</P>
<P>
Jamison looks as if he belongs at the beach, not in the gym. His short blond 
hair, tanned skin and soft-spoken demeanor fit the stereotypical Southern 
California image. It's no surprise, then, that the Mar Vista resident also 
plays volleyball, the unofficial sport of the beach. 
</P>
<P>
He played for Loyola as a sophomore, when the team won the mythical national 
championship. Jamison did not play during his junior year due to off-season 
basketball conflicts, but returned as a senior to help the Cubs win the Del Rey 
League. A few colleges were interested in Jamison for his volleyball skills, 
but he was intent on playing basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very interested in him," USC volleyball Coach Jim McLaughlin said. 
"But his coach told us he was going to play basketball, so we called off the 
dogs. I think he had the potential to be a great middle blocker." 
</P>
<P>
Jamison said: "Not to put the sport down, but volleyball sometimes gets a 
little boring to me. You don't get to run all the time, and you're not involved 
in all the plays." 
</P>
<P>
But he did choose volleyball over baseball, with the seasons running at the 
same time. Jamison, a pitcher, denied the Del Rey League the unusual sight of 
seeing a 6-11 player standing atop the mound. 
</P>
<P>
Jamison said that playing volleyball has helped his basketball game by 
improving his coordination and lateral movement. Of the three sports, Jamison 
has been playing basketball the longest, having first picked up a ball 10 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
By making basketball his No. 1 pick, Jamison also chose to play the sport with 
the most intense recruiting process. The summer before Jamison's junior year, 
Thomason met with him and his parents to tell them what the coming year had in 
store. Jamison said this, along with the coach's periodic advice during the 
season, helped him keep things in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"Overall, (being recruited) was a positive experience for me," Jamison said. "A 
lot of people think of it as being a real burden. But I seemed to control it. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned about people and what they'd try to do when they want something. 
Everyone was trying to be my friend, so I looked out for those types of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Marymount, UC Santa Barbara and New Mexico were among Jamison's final 
choices, but California's combination of coaches, academics, location and a 
challenging conference won out. 
</P>
<P>
Jamison's hopes for a high school basketball championship ended when Loyola 
lost the Southern Section 5-A Division championship game to Mater Dei, 83-57. 
Jamison, who had lost 20 pounds during a weeklong bout with the flu, scored 
only six points and grabbed six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about beating Mater Dei even if I was healthy, but I would have 
loved to have been 100%," Jamison said. "You always want to imagine yourself 
playing in front of a big crowd and doing well. It was a big letdown." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the memory of that disappointment will drive Jamison to work harder in 
college. He won't be playing against high school boys anymore, and California 
is a team on the rise. The Golden Bears went to the NCAA tournament last 
season, and defeated Indiana in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
Thomason said Jamison's improvement is only a matter of putting in enough 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the skills, he has the talent, he just has to keep working and he'll 
improve," Thomason said. "And you can't put a premium on a 6-11 guy with his 
versatility." 
</P>
<P>
Jamison had an active role both offensively and defensively in Thomason's 
up-tempo style of play. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not the type of big kid who just plops down in the low post," Thomason 
said. "He can run the court, fill the lane (on fast breaks) and hit the jump 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
Campanelli knows he's getting a multiskilled player. 
</P>
<P>
"He's got the ability to score and he's a very good passer for a big man," 
Campanelli said. "Once he gets stronger, he'll be able to rebound better. He's 
got the potential to be a solid player in the Pac-10." 
</P>
<P>
The consensus between the coaches is that only Jamison will determine how 
effective he can be. You can add Jamison's name to the list. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it all depends on me," Jamison said. "Cal never promised me anything, 
they're just willing to give me a fair shot. I'm just going to give it 100% and 
whatever comes out of it, I can live with it. Either way, I'm prepared."

VAN NUYS NOTCHES 3-1 LEGION VICTORY OVER FALTERING EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oscar Macias had Woodland Hills East batters biting on off-speed pitches, and 
his Van Nuys-Notre Dame teammates helped him reel front-running East back 
toward the pack in its division. 
</P>
<P>
"I had them scouted," Van Nuys Coach Jody Breeden said. "Their two-three-four 
players, if you get two strikes on them, they go fishing for the off-speed 
stuff, and that's the kind of pitcher (Macias) is." 
</P>
<P>
Macias allowed seven singles in 8 2/3 innings, and East's two-through-four 
hitters finished a cumulative one for 11 in a 3-1 loss in American Legion 
District 20 play Saturday afternoon at Notre Dame High. 
</P>
<P>
East (15-4), which rocketed out of the blocks with a 14-1 record, lost for the 
third time this week and now holds a mere half-game lead over Woodland Hills 
West in the Western Division with one week remaining in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys (11-6), which competes in the Eastern Division, improved its playoff 
chances considerably with the win. 
</P>
<P>
"We're coming up with big wins over good teams," said outfielder Chris Prince, 
who finished three for four and drove in all three Van Nuys runs. 
</P>
<P>
Prince drove in the game's first run in the bottom of the first when he hit a 
chopper up the middle that glanced off second baseman Matt Allison's glove and 
scored Eric Martorano from third. 
</P>
<P>
East didn't manage a hit until the third inning but tied the score in the 
fourth. Carey Wilbur drove in Jamie Zeichick with a two-out infield single. 
Eric Rothman followed with a single but was thrown out stealing to end the 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
The score was still tied, 1-1, in the bottom of the seventh before Van Nuys 
loaded the bases on three consecutive singles. Cleanup hitter Prince then 
lashed a two-run single over second base to close out the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
"The infield was playing in and I just got a fastball up and took it over the 
middle," said Prince, who said he has been tinkering with his stroke all 
summer. "I've been changing my hands around a lot. Now, I'm just holding my 
hands up, and it's keeping me from popping up." 
</P>
<P>
Macias said he also is looking to round back into form after being unable to 
pitch much of the spring because of shoulder tendinitis. 
</P>
<P>
"This is kind of like a comeback situation for me," said Macias. He threw a 
variety of curves and changeups, "anything that would keep them off balance at 
the plate." 
</P>
<P>
The right-handed Macias (4-0) retired East on four pitches in both the first 
and seventh innings. He walked three and struck out three before yielding to 
reliever Eric Vellozzi with two on and two out in the ninth. Vellozzi retired 
the first man he faced to earn the save. 
</P>
<P>
East's Chris Brown (7-3) struck out eight and walked three in eight innings. He 
allowed three hits in the first and four in the seventh but only two in the 
other six innings. 
</P>
<P>
Martorano, who moved from the eighth spot to leadoff, scored twice and had two 
singles for Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Rothman, with two singles, was the only East player with more than one hit.

run in a 3-1 loss. JOEL BEESON / for The Times

KRIEGER AVOIDS 5-CAR CRASH TO WIN MAIN EVENT AT SAUGUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN FLEISCHMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A five-car accident on the second lap of the Sportsman Division main event at 
Saugus Speedway delayed the 40-lap race for nearly an hour Saturday night 
before a crowd of 3,553. 
</P>
<P>
But after the race restarted, Larry Krieger of Reseda won for the second 
consecutive week. Krieger passed Tom Eurton of Valencia on Lap 30 and held on 
for the victory in a 14-car field. Craig Rayburn of Simi Valley finished 
second, followed by Pat Mintey of Quartz Hill and Dave Phipps of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the win, Krieger, who entered the night third in the points 
standings, will remain behind points leader Will Harper. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Staubs of Littlerock won the 15-lap figure-eight main event. Steve Nickolai 
of Simi Valley finished second, followed by Russ Beckers of Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
A videotape of the Sportsman Division accident showed that a car driven by Gary 
Sigman of Carson got turned around on the backstretch. Keith Spangler's car 
collided head-on with Sigman and then John Cran of Reseda rear-ended Spangler, 
became airborne and went over the top of Spangler's car. 
</P>
<P>
Spangler, of Northridge, was taken to the hospital for X-rays after leaving his 
car under his own power. The race was delayed until another ambulance could 
arrive at the track. 
</P>
<P>
Cran entered the night second in the Sportsman points standings. Spangler was 
fourth and Sigman seventh. 
</P>
<P>
Also involved in the accident was Mintey, who entered the night eighth in the 
points standings. Mintey, who had the night's fastest qualifying time, was able 
to re-enter the race, however, because his car did not sustain major damage. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Nickolai took advantage of a few breaks -- and a lot of skill -- to 
win the 25-lap Street Stock main event and take over the points lead. 
</P>
<P>
Nickolai started sixth but moved up to second, behind Chris Doyle of Canyon 
Country, by passing Larry Durm of Northridge on Lap 18. 
</P>
<P>
Nickolai then passed Doyle, who had led the whole race, during a yellow flag on 
Lap 23. Nickolai had to pass on the inside to avoid a stalled car. 
</P>
<P>
The win was the first main-event victory of the season for Nickolai, who 
started the night tied for third in the points standings. 
</P>
<P>
Nickolai also got some help when Russ Beckers of Sepulveda, who was running in 
second place, was involved in an accident and went to the back of the pack. 
Also sent to the back was Staubs, who was running third. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, points leader Dave Blankenship was unable to compete because of an 
illegally wide wheelbase and Thad Friday of Reseda, who was second in 
standings, was unable to finish the race when his motor failed. 
</P>
<P>
Doyle finished second, followed by Ed Horst of Reseda, Doug Renno of Canoga 
Park and Rayburn. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Petty of Palmdale led from the beginning to win the Street Stock semi-main 
event and advance to the main event. The race was called after nine laps 
because of an accident involving Sean Hadley of Reseda and Dave Osborne. 
</P>
<P>
Durm won two Street Stock heat races. Other heat-race winners included Larry 
Woodside of Saugus and Rayburn (Sportsman); Mike Johannes of Van Nuys and Jim 
Marlewski of Simi Valley (Street Stock); and Petty and Staubs (figure eight). 
</P>
<P>
Trophy-dash winners included Krieger in the Sportsman, Ken Maler of Castaic 
(Street Stock) and Rayburn (figure eight).

<TEXT>
<P>
Dorrey Brandt and Anthony Trear began their semifinal matches Saturday at the 
74th La Jolla Tennis Tournament in similar fashion -- losing in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt, a senior at San Diego State, said her mind was "way out there" when she 
fell behind 5-1 in the first set, while Trear, who hadn't played a tournament 
in 2 1/2 years, said he was just hoping he could win a game after dropping the 
first set at love. 
</P>
<P>
But both players advanced to today's finals at the La Jolla Tennis Club after 
Brandt's mind eventually wandered back to the tennis court and Trear's 
confidence level rose after he finally won a game. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt went on to win 10 consecutive games in defeating No. 1 seeded Lisa 
Seeman of Solvang, 7-5, 6-2. She will play University of San Diego's Tonya 
Fuller at 9 a.m. in the women's open final. Fuller beat Julie Coakley of UC 
Santa Barbara, 6-1, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Trear, 31, of Ramona will play 20-year-old Tony Bujon of Texas Christian 
University in the men's open final at 10:30 a.m. after beating Todd Ryska of 
Glendale, 0-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-1). Bujon, who advanced to the round of 16 in this 
year's NCAA singles tournament, defeated John Steel of La Jolla, 7-5, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Brandt, seeded fourth, had fallen behind 4-0 in her two previous matches, so 
she wasn't overly concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt I could come back," she said. "I wasn't too worried about the score. I 
just wanted to start playing better. I wasn't concentrating on the ball and I 
was missing a lot of easy volleys." 
</P>
<P>
But Brandt's volleys began to fall inside the baseline and her passing shots, 
which had been finding the net or Seeman's racket, started whizzing by the 
flat-footed Seeman. At one point, Brandt won 10 consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
After being broken five times in row, Seeman broke Brandt and held her serve to 
close within 4-2. But Seeman continued her pattern, which began in the first 
set, of missing easy overheads and volleys in the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
"She was frustrated because I came back so quickly," Brandt said. "I pretty 
much turned it on and she wasn't moving too well." 
</P>
<P>
Brandt will be going for her second consecutive singles crown today. Three 
weeks ago she won a United States Tennis Assn. circuit event at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm playing well and I'm having a lot of fun," Brandt said. 
</P>
<P>
Fuller, seeded fifth, also seems to be having fun. She knocked off two seeds, 
ex-SDSU player Sondra Mitchell and USC's Linda Allred, before beating Coakley, 
who was unseeded. 
</P>
<P>
Trear, who played college tennis at UCLA, said he was beginning to think Ryska 
was invincible. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping he would crack before too long -- luckily he did," Trear said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real mental battle for me. I've had a lot of trouble with that part 
of my tennis in the past. But today I seemed to stay focused." 
</P>
<P>
In the men's 60 doubles division, two-time U.S. Open champion Pancho Gonzales 
made his first La Jolla tournament appearance in 47 years a success. Gonzales 
and his partner Bill Davis defeated Earl McAdams and Chuck Slitgerber, 6-4, 
6-2, in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Gonzales played La Jolla he entered five divisions at the age of 
14.

The San Diego Nomads dropped a 2-1 decision to the California Emperors in 
Redlands Saturday night despite taking an early 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Nomads went up three minutes into the game when Steve Black pounced on a 
loose ball in front of the net and kicked it in. 
</P>
<P>
But a minute and a half later, the Emperors tied the game when Kurt Allan put 
one into the upper-left corner from 40 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
Mahntie Reeves closed the scoring with a goal in the game's 56th minute for 
California. 
</P>

CITIES GIVE SIGH OF RELIEF AFTER QUIET 4TH; 
</P>
<P>
SAFETY: IT WAS THE LEAST TROUBLESOME INDEPENDENCE DAY IN MEMORY, WITH JUST ONE 
MAJOR BLAZE OCCURRING IN CERRITOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It has taken intensive advertising, a lot of pleading and some threatening, but 
area firefighters said it appears that residents have finally gotten the 
message that fireworks are dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Southeast firefighters said this year's Independence Day celebration was the 
quietest they could recall, even though only Cudahy, Whittier, Long Beach and 
La Habra Heights bar the sale of fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious fireworks-related blaze happened in Cerritos, where a home was 
destroyed while the family was at a professional fireworks show. But roof and 
apartment house fires in Montebello and Paramount also made them hot spots 
relative to other area cities, where the most serious fireworks-related calls 
were in response to grass fires and burning palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great," said Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Leonard Fontes, whose 
station covers Bell Gardens and parts of Bell and Cudahy. "We had no home 
fires, no injuries, no loss. It was unreal. We were expecting the usual 
onslaught." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Robert Viers, whose station covers Maywood, Bell 
and parts of Cudahy and Huntington Park, also said this was a quieter year than 
usual. In the past, he said, it was not unusual to respond to two or three 
fireworks-caused blazes in buildings. 
</P>
<P>
This year, his station responded to three grass fires, and no damage was 
reported, Viers said. 
</P>
<P>
"If this is all we had each year, it would be great," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Viers, Fontes and other fire captains attributed the decrease in accidents, 
injuries and fires to extensive media coverage, combined with increasingly 
aggressive fire prevention programs that emphasize penalties for the use of 
illegal fireworks and that instruct residents on how to use legal fireworks 
safely. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are getting educated, finally," said Capt. Jerry Epperson, 
whose station covers La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
Norwalk Fire Capt. Steve Noble said high-profile cruising by firefighters on 
the lookout for illegal fireworks helped in his area: "People get loony at this 
time, but the high visibility of firemen out on the streets helped us. This 
prevented a lot of problems. They knew we were there." 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach, firefighters waited with police at the city's borders of 
neighboring Lakewood, Paramount and Compton, where the sale of state-approved 
fireworks is permitted. Residents walking into Long Beach with fireworks were 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
"They told them to either walk back across the border or we'd confiscate them," 
said Bob Caldon, Long Beach Fire Department spokesman. "We confiscated one 
guy's fireworks, and he had just paid $300 for them." 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies, acting on an anonymous tip, confiscated nearly 100 boxes of 
illegal professional-grade fireworks from a Whittier garage Wednesday and 
arrested two men on suspicion of selling illegal explosives, selling fireworks 
without a permit and possession of more than one pound of explosives. 
</P>
<P>
A Cerritos home was destroyed when a bottle rocket landed on its shake roof 
after the family left to watch the city-sponsored fireworks show at Cerritos 
College. 
</P>
<P>
County Fire Capt. Pat Sullivan said that the fire at 11343 Abana St. started 
about 9:20 p.m. Wednesday. Neighbors reported that someone in an adjoining 
neighborhood was firing bottle rockets, one of which was found on the roof next 
door to the fire, Sullivan said. He said damage is estimated at $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Cerritos "should ban fireworks," said Mina Ramesh Shah, the distraught owner of 
the burned home. 
</P>
<P>
The Cerritos City Council voted last year to place on the November ballot an 
advisory measure asking voters whether fireworks should be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
In Montebello, firefighters battled two apartment fires and a carport fire. 
They have not determined whether any were caused by fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
Several Montebello families were left homeless Wednesday by a blaze that 
started on a shake roof at an eight-unit apartment complex at 221 N. Fourth St. 
The fire began at 10:25 a.m., destroyed the roof and damaged second-floor 
units, firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross was asked to find shelter for those the blaze displaced. 
</P>
<P>
Paramount Fire Capt. Leonard Guillen said the Fourth was as busy as usual for 
his station. His crews responded to one garage fire, two roof fires and a 
kitchen fire caused by a child who threw a firecracker behind the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
In Long Beach, it was a quiet night for firefighters, but police showed up in 
force along the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Police cited about 40 people for drinking in public and possession of 
fireworks, which carries a $1,000 fine and even jail time. Police also arrested 
four or five people for public drunkenness, according to police Lt. Richard 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 45 officers monitored beaches and parks on foot, in patrol cars, aboard a 
helicopter and in all-terrain vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Seventeen of the officers concentrated in the Alamitos Bay Peninsula, where 
three years ago police reported a near-riot when young people became rowdy and 
fighting broke out. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, police have closed off the peninsula on the Fourth to drivers who 
are not residents or friends of residents. On Wednesday, all drivers entering 
the peninsula had to prove they belonged in the area by either providing 
identification with a peninsula address or the telephone number of an area 
resident, who was then asked to vouch for the person. 
</P>
<P>
The blockade angered some people, and Jones conceded that police got some 
complaints, but many residents told police "they really appreciated us down 
there, (and said) we were a stabilizing force." 
</P>
<P>
In Signal Hill, about 2,500 people gathered for clear views of spectacular sky 
shows from as close as the Queen Mary and Veterans Stadium in Long Beach and as 
far away as Disneyland in Anaheim, Signal Hill Police Cdr. James Butzbach said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a beautiful night," he said. "Over the years, it's become an 
attraction. It's a family affair out there. People come out with their picnic 
baskets and just kick back. You have your pick of the shows out there." 
</P>

DISTRICT TO ADD TEACHERS TO BOOST ENGLISH INSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD BLUME, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Responding to state demands and a federal civil rights investigation, the Los 
Nietos School District Governing Board has unanimously agreed to remedy teacher 
shortages and other problems in the district's programs for students who do not 
speak English as a first language. Under the plan, adopted June 26, the 
district will hire or train at least three teachers per year from now to 1994, 
either to conduct classes in Spanish or teach English as a second language. The 
district, whose student population is 90% Latino, now has two teachers 
certified to teach bilingual classes. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators from the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights 
concluded that the district: 
</P>
<P>
* Has too few teachers to serve non-English speakers. 
</P>
<P>
* Lacks proper educational materials for bilingual students. 
</P>
<P>
* Gives instructors insufficient guidance on teaching non-native speakers. 
</P>
<P>
* Neglects the reading and writing skills of students who are only fluent as 
speakers. 
</P>
<P>
* Classifies students as fluent in English before they are fully prepared for 
regular classes. 
</P>
<P>
About 406 Latino students need immediate language aid in the 2,000-student 
district, which straddles parts of Santa Fe Springs and Whittier and consists 
of three elementary campuses and one middle school. The district now places 
bilingual teaching aides in classes as needed to help teachers communicate with 
students who lack English fluency. 
</P>
<P>
Adeline Rocha, the school board president, said she knew about problems in the 
district's bilingual program even before the report was finished: "I heard from 
two parents that their children were not being put into the bilingual 
classroom. The parents wanted their children to learn immediately in their 
language, and then move rapidly into learning English as a second language. 
That wasn't happening." 
</P>
<P>
When news broke about the U.S. civil rights investigation, the district was 
already responding to state officials who had expressed concerns similar to 
those of federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
The state review happens every four years. The Office of Civil Rights 
investigation began in response to a complaint filed Dec. 5. It alleged "a 
pattern of discrimination" against Latino students because of a dearth of 
language services. 
</P>
<P>
Interim Supt. Charles Menzies recalled saying to federal investigators: "I'm 
familiar with other districts. Some of the things that you're telling me we 
need, I know are also needed in other districts." 
</P>
<P>
But, Menzies said: "They received a complaint about us (not the others). At the 
beginning, we were very defensive, upset. We wanted to know who blew the 
whistle, how dare they say they're afraid to come forward." 
</P>
<P>
Later, he talked to an administrator who had a similar experience earlier. "She 
made me see it from a positive view," Menzies said. "It got them off the dime, 
and now they have a very good program, one that they're very proud of. 
</P>
<P>
"If they tell us we need to do it, then we can't ignore them, and we're going 
to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Because unemployed bilingual teachers are rare, the district will pay 10 of its 
own teachers $19 an hour to learn Spanish this summer. The district has also 
paid the course fee for them. 
</P>
<P>
Most will probably not know enough Spanish to earn bilingual certificates in 
time to teach classes next fall, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Menzies said the district's efforts mostly "came about after December. Our 
population hasn't changed. Just our attitude has changed. It's a very positive 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
The regional Office for Civil Rights, which monitors school districts in 
California, Arizona, Nevada and Hawaii, investigates about 300 complaints a 
year, said John Palomino, regional director. The office is charged with making 
sure that students receive equal educational opportunities, regardless of sex, 
race, color, national origin or handicap. 
</P>
<P>
About 80% of the investigations turn up problems, investigator Michael Riggin 
said. The most frequent deficiency found is in special-education programs, 
which serve students with mental, emotional or physical handicaps. The No. 2 
source of violations occurs in programs for students with limited 
English-language skills. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1977, 30 Los Angeles County school districts, including Los Nietos, have 
been investigated and found to offer inadequate language assistance. Each 
district has submitted a plan to address the problem. If they had not, the 
districts could have lost their federal money.

CONGRATULATIONS TO HONOR STUDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although I do not come from Ecuador, and West San Antonio was my barrio and not 
Carmelitos Housing Project, I also lived through the exhilaration of earning a 
perfect high school academic transcript (San Antonio Vocational and Technical 
High School, now "Fox High") in June, 1956, and shortly afterward found myself 
"young, talented and Mexican" at Texas A &amp; M and Rice universities. (The 
term Hispanics had not yet been "invented.") 
</P>
<P>
We had no trouble in calling ourselves poor Mexicans in Texas. Fierce 
uncomplicatedness or lack of sophistication? 
</P>
<P>
For 2 1/2 years I worked as a staff mathematician at TRW in Houston before 
coming here to work for Fluor and go to UCLA. Good things can happen. 
</P>
<P>
It was a pleasure to read your article "4.0 Student Breaks Free of Housing 
Project Stereotypes" (The Times, June 28). I thank you for the article and 
congratulate the spirit of Viviana Arellano, a courageous and intelligent 
person. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, many in the larger population believe that such personal 
adaptation to reality as she perceived it constitutes "elitism" and that she 
should "stay in her place." 
</P>
<P>
I suggest to Arellano that she should develop personal leadership and teaching 
potential so as to tactfully and diplomatically make this country truly a 
kinder and gentler place.

ROLL CALL: THE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Romania and Family Planning 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 224 to 198, the House limited the way $1.5 million for family 
planning in Romania can be handled. The vote was a victory for anti-abortion 
forces. It occurred as the House sent a $15.6-billion fiscal 1991 foreign aid 
bill (HR 5114) to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The amendment kept the $1.5 million from being administered by either the 
Planned Parenthood Federation or the U.N. Fund for Population Activities. 
Critics say those groups advocate abortion among other population control 
options. Foes of the amendment called the point moot because the bill already 
kept any of the Romanian aid from being spent on abortions. 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote supported the anti-abortion position on administering U.S. family 
planning aid in Romania.

Aid to Cambodia 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 260 to 163, the House adopted an Administration-backed amendment 
to provide $7 million in non-lethal aid to forces fighting the communist, 
pro-Vietnam government of Cambodia.The aid was controversial because the 
insurgents include Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge, notorious for killing millions of 
Cambodians while ruling the country from 1975 to 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.) said the aid would help end the Cambodian 
civil war and achieve free elections. The Khmer Rouge could not win an election 
and thus could not regain power, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica) said "our policy of aiding the Khmer Rouge 
alliance has given respectability to the most genocidal killers since the 
Nazis." 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to send $7 million to anti-government forces in Cambodia 
including the Khmer Rouge.

Wild and Scenic Rivers 
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 93 to 323, the House refused to prohibit the federal government 
from using eminent domain as it includes the Niobrara River in Nebraska in the 
Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Several dozen property owners could have their 
land condemned under a bill (S 28) to put 76 miles of the river into the 
federal preservation system. The bill was sent to conference with the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsor Don Young (R-Alaska) said "to have the American government condemn your 
land because somebody likes to look at it is not America." 
</P>
<P>
Opponent Peter H. Kostmayer (D-Pa.) said "if we adopt this amendment, we are 
gutting this legislation. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
A yes vote was to keep the government from condemning land to protect the 
Niobrara River.

PLEA FOR BUILDERS TO AVOID WHITTIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I hope Jeanne Muhlestein is right when she says that responsible developers 
have become wary of bringing their business to Whittier ("Projects Exempted 
from Whittier's Building Freeze." The Times, July 1). We can only hope that all 
the other developers will follow their lead.

DRUG FUNDS TO BE USED TO PAY FOR OFFICERS

HUNTINGTON PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This financially strapped city will use hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
drug forfeiture money during 1990-91 to pay for seven new sworn officers and 
six other police employees to fight rising crime. 
</P>
<P>
The thirteen employees, as well as equipment for them, represent the only 
significant new expense authorized by the City Council during a series of 
recent budget meetings. Those meetings concluded last Monday, when the council 
approved a $30-million austerity budget. 
</P>
<P>
The council decided to use the forfeiture money, which was seized during drug 
busts involving Huntington Park police, when it became apparent that there was 
not enough money in the city's general fund to pay for the additional officers. 
</P>
<P>
Cities usually avoid using uncertain funding sources to pay for ongoing 
expenses such as police officers or other personnel, according to city 
officials. If the Huntington Park Police Department, for example, is not 
involved in any large drug busts in the next year, the flow of forfeiture funds 
could slow to a trickle. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Park has $1.4 million in forfeiture money, about $1.25 million of 
which came from a record cocaine bust at a Sylmar warehouse last year, Police 
Chief Patrick M. Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>
The additional seven officers, plus five jailers, a records clerk and the new 
guns, radios and other equipment for them, will cost the city about $1.2 
million a year, Connolly said. Once the forfeiture money runs out, the city 
will have to find additional funding or lay off the officers. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are hoping that sales tax and other revenue will increase enough 
to keep the officers, but they are not counting on it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible problem," Mayor Thomas E. Jackson said. "We're going to go 
into a program that we have no visible means of continuing. We're hoping that 
the effect of this program will be so overwhelming that we might run most of 
the bad guys out of town." 
</P>
<P>
Hiring more police officers has been a priority of city officials. Crime has 
been rising in Huntington Park, which has plenty of gang activity and one of 
the highest auto theft rates in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Its Police Department will have 67 sworn officers with the new positions. The 
city's population is about 52,000, and it has fewer officers per 1,000 
residents than the average city in California, according to a recent study by 
UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1987, financial problems forced the city to eliminate three police 
positions, along with positions in other departments. 
</P>
<P>
The council tried to obtain funding for 15 more officers last year when it put 
a measure on the ballot that would have imposed a 7% utility tax to raise $2.7 
million. But the measure was defeated at the polls. All four major candidates 
in last April's election called for more police during their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
It will be about six months before the new officers are on the streets, 
Connolly said. 
</P>
<P>
The city will spend about $10 million from its general fund, which is closely 
watched because it pays most city salaries. The city should finish the year 
with a general fund reserve of $590,000, Chief Administrative Officer Donald L. 
Jeffers said. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the money in the $30-million budget is earmarked to pay for the 
cost of operating the municipal water system and the city's dial-a-ride 
program, and to maintain city streets, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, this will give the city the opportunity to begin building an 
appropriate reserve," Jeffers told the council in a report.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: LOWER AIR FARES FOR CONSUMERS NOT IN THE CARDS;

<P>
Has airline deregulation worked? 
</P>
<P>
It is the great continuing argument among government regulators, members of the 
travel industry and, for that matter, anyone who travels. 
</P>
<P>
Most airline officials argue that it has worked to the benefit of the masses, 
that it has popularized commercial aviation and that fares, on the whole, have 
decreased. These same officials say they have the numbers to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of airline deregulation in 1978, the number of passengers 
has almost doubled (more than 456 million in 1988, the last year for which 
complete data was available), while air fares measured in constant dollars 
declined 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of deregulation also argue that passengers today enjoy more airline 
choices. In 1978, airline passengers could choose from two or more airlines 
only 69% of the time. In 1988, they had a choice 89% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, one study shows that the nation's travelers have benefited by more 
than $100 billion in fare savings since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
It all sounds pretty good. So why are many air travelers complaining? 
</P>
<P>
In California, where regulated intrastate air fares could get you between Los 
Angeles and San Francisco for as little as $16 at the beginning of 
deregulation, the one-way fare has recently been as high as $186. A Los 
Angeles-Sacramento round trip, which once cost less than $30, now can run as 
high as $213! 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the country has experienced a similar explosion of high air fares, 
especially on the high-density commuter runs between Chicago and New York, 
Detroit and Chicago, and on New York shuttle flights to Washington and Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers flying from cities such as St. Louis, Minneapolis and Dallas are 
often shocked -- by their lack of choice in airlines and by the diminishing 
number of carriers on certain routes. Consumers looking for reasonable air 
fares on these routes are often finding themselves out of luck and paying high 
air-transportation bills. 
</P>
<P>
Why is this happening? 
</P>
<P>
One reason is something called "yield management" -- the practice of 
controlling the inventory of seats available at specific fares on specific 
flights on specific days. Virtually every airline now follows this yield 
management routine, which tends to limit most discount seats if there is a 
strong demand for particular flights. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason has been the development of "fortress hubs," airports that are 
essentially monopolized by a single airline. In Pittsburgh, for example, USAir 
has a staggering 84% of all flights in and out of that city. TWA controls 82% 
of the traffic out of St. Louis. And Minneapolis is dominated by Northwest, 
with 80% of the flights. 
</P>
<P>
In these fortress hubs, passengers have sometimes paid fares as much as 50% 
higher than fares for similar flights (and distances) in other parts of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
A third reason is the myth developing that deregulation has stimulated 
competition among airlines. In truth, in a deregulated marketplace, the only 
real competition is waged between existing, longstanding airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Recent history indicates that new airlines just don't survive. And this is 
unfortunate. It is, it seems, also inevitable. Airlines may be deregulated, but 
airports are not. New airlines often experience great difficulty in obtaining 
gate space from the large carriers that apparently control the supply. 
</P>
<P>
And even if a new airline can get a gate, the only weapon it has to attract new 
passengers -- low fares -- will almost immediately be turned against them when 
competitors also lower their fares. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing that they have both loyal and frequent passengers, thanks to major 
marketing tools such as frequent-flier programs, the big airlines match the low 
fares. 
</P>
<P>
The philosophy of the fare-matching by the big carriers has nothing to do with 
attracting new business or making money. Instead, the low fares are matched by 
the big carriers because they have deep pockets -- they know they can lose 
money longer at these low fares than the new airline. And, more often that not, 
the new airline soon goes out of business (in many cases even after flying 
planes that are 100% full). 
</P>
<P>
The big airlines argue that this merely represents healthy competition. Except 
that in almost all cases, when the new low-fare airline goes out of business 
(or is otherwise sold/merged or consolidated into another carrier), air fares 
rise. One study by the U.S. General Accounting Office indicated that ticket 
prices at these fortress airports have indeed risen faster than at other 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Justice is now investigating this development -- the 
domination of major airports by one or two large carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Already, federal prosecuters have asked USAir to provide specific information 
about how gates will be allocated at a new passenger terminal at Greater 
Pittsburgh International Airport. Key to the investigation is whether the 
airline (which already dominates Pittsburgh) has any arrangements with the 
airport that would make it harder for a new airline to try to start service 
there. 
</P>
<P>
(The Justice Department had previously opposed the mergers between TWA and 
Ozark, and betweenNorthwest and Republic. But the deals were approved by the 
Transportation Department, which had authority in these cases.) 
</P>
<P>
While the investigation continues, the most passenger gripes are coming from 
those who insist they are being gouged on short-haul flights: St. Louis to 
Springfield, Ill. ($189 one way); Los Angeles to San Francisco ($186 one way), 
and the shuttle fares in New York ($119 each way to Boston or Washington). 
</P>
<P>
But the airline lobby insists that these fares are not excessive. They claim 
that the average air fare between Los Angeles and Sacramento is 80% of the fare 
for routes of the same distance elsewhere in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But does that make things fair for travelers? 
</P>
<P>
Obviously not. 
</P>
<P>
"I can buy the argument that airline labor and other related costs have 
increased since deregulation began," says Los Angeles public relations 
executive Joseph Cerrell, a regular passenger on the Los Angeles-Sacramento 
run. If anyone remembers low air fares on that route, it's Cerrell. Back in 
1967, his second-biggest client was PSA. Los Angeles to San Diego was $6.67, 
San Francisco from LAX went for $12. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sacramento fare was $14.50," he recalls. "I can accept that I wouldn't be 
paying that fare today. But how can an airline justify charging me $426 to fly 
between Sacramento and Los Angeles? On some airlines, for just a little more or 
a little less, I could fly between Los Angeles and London. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the choice between Sacramento and London, I think I'd choose London. 
After all," he says with a laugh, "I'd get more mileage, have a meal and even 
see a movie or two on the way. OK, the airline has a valid argument that it 
costs them more to operate in 1990. But in the 10 years since deregulation, 
have the airline costs risen more than 15 times? I think not." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there has been a strange twisting of events. During regulation, the 
federal government set short-haul fares below cost and long-haul fares above 
cost. And now, since deregulation, the exact opposite has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
In California, some legislators have attempted to pass legislation to correct 
this imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
First, State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) introduced a bill that would have 
created a state-run airline, a sort of legislative challenge to the airlines to 
lower their air fares in the California intrastate market. The bill was 
defeated when the airline lobby argued that the cost of the airline would cost 
taxpayers money. 
</P>
<P>
However, the California Senate did pass legislation that would require airlines 
to give up unused airport gates or pay a fine of $2,500 per day -- an attempt 
to let new airlines into the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, how do you go about trying to secure a low air fare? 
</P>
<P>
You can do your own form of comparison shopping, calling airline toll-free 
reservation numbers until you find a fare you can accept. 
</P>
<P>
You can also find a travel agency that uses a computer program called "Fare 
Assurance," a program that automatically -- and without bias -- searches for 
new, cheaper air fares. 
</P>
<P>
You can also subscribe to something called "Best Fares," a monthly publication 
that lists all the published coach fares for hundreds of possible itineraries. 
A one-year membership costs $68. Call them at (800) 635-3033. 
</P>
<P>
But in the long run, a San Francisco firm called Marketel thinks it may have 
the answer: Put airline tickets on an electronic auction block, a sort of 
futures market for air fares. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only a matter of time," says Marketel founder and senior vice president 
Bill Perell, "before the negative aspects of airline oligopoly forces the 
government to re-regulate. The airlines don't want this, but at the same time, 
the airlines haven't allowed the consumer to express his/her fare preferences." 
</P>
<P>
Under the Marketel plan, prospective airline passengers would electronically 
submit their bids for seats on specific flights via their home personal 
computers. The request would list departure dates, times and the price the 
passenger is willing to pay. Airlines would then review the bids and pick the 
ones they wanted to accept. 
</P>
<P>
As in a typical commodities market transaction, the computer would compare bid 
prices with anonymously placed "sell" orders by the airlines and then make a 
match. (This would also apply to hotel rooms and rental cars.) 
</P>
<P>
These passenger bids would be firm fare offers, backed by a credit card. If the 
airline accepted the bid, the passenger would then be charged for the ticket -- 
presumably at a lower-than-published price -- and the airline would be able to 
better allocate their seats. 
</P>
<P>
"It would work well for everyone," says Perell. "For some folks, it would 
eliminate the six-day madness that occurs when people needing to make a plane 
reservation discover they just missed the cutoff for a lower seven-day, 
advance-purchase ticket. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, because of the lower fares inherent with bidding most flights, the 
airlines would receive additional revenue from travel that might not otherwise 
occur because of high quoted fares. In today's market, everyone is a 
discretionary traveler." 
</P>
<P>
Marketel expects to have its system up and running later this year. Once the 
system is in place, airline passengers may have at their disposal their first 
direct chance to influence air fares in their favor. 
</P>
<P>
With luck, the hunt for lower air fares will then be made that much easier.

THE MARTYR OF THE RAIN FOREST; 
</P>
<P>
THE BURNING SEASON THE MURDER OF CHICO MENDES AND THE FIGHT FOR THE AMAZON RAIN 
FOREST BY ANDREW REVKIN (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $19.95; 511 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David M. Graber, Graber is a research biologist with the National Park 
Service. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We Norteamericanos are suddenly smitten with the Amazonian rain forest. Now 
that our passion burns so brightly -- and seemingly without end -- it is 
politically instructive to consider briefly how such a state of affairs came to 
pass in just a few years. 
</P>
<P>
Only a decade ago, biologists working in the tropics began to warn their 
colleagues that agricultural practices and development in tropical America were 
beginning to have an impact on some species, and that ambitious development 
plans such as the trans-Amazonian highway could lead to catastrophe for what 
was then the largest and most diverse uninterrupted biological community in the 
world. Anthropologists had begun to protest the progressive extinctions of 
native people both through loss of habitat and by direct genocide. 
</P>
<P>
By the mid-'80s, climatologists were contributing a new chord: the Greenhouse 
Effect, in which the burning of Amazonia was contributing carbon dioxide while 
eliminating one of the world's great storehouses of excess carbon. And perhaps, 
they suggested, clear-cutting would lead to irreversible desertification of one 
of the wettest places on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
We worried about trading golden lion tamarins in the forest for Brazilian beef 
for our hamburgers. Photographs of the scarring and burning from the space 
shuttle offered dramatic visuals. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as we enter the '90s, the world's bankers, agronomists and politicians are 
asking if there isn't a "softer path" for the tropics to develop, something 
more compatible with its own ecological rhythms. And finally the world's 
communications media have penetrated Amazonia in a big way, providing their own 
peculiar contribution of information and shallow, exploitative confusion. 
</P>
<P>
This last has meant -- as usual -- that the First World, especially America -- 
as usual -- has engendered an Amazonia in its own image, with noble rustics, 
exploitative capitalists, cuddly animals, graceful trees and miraculous powers 
of global salvation. Almost nobody north of the Equator knew who Chico Mendes 
was until he was murdered, but today he is the martyr of the rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
The best thing about "The Burning Season" is its insistence on complexity. The 
Amazon of our imaginings is a cartoon. Andrew Revkin, whose customary beats are 
science reporting for The Times and Discover magazine, demolishes that cartoon. 
His foil is Chico Mendes, the radical Brazilian rubber tapper (seringueiro) who 
fought deforestation to sustain the culture of his people, and who was adopted 
by the world's environmental avant-garde shortly before his predictable murder 
by ranchers as 1988 drew to a close. 
</P>
<P>
Revkin took a cram course in Portuguese, then spent a couple of months talking 
to people in the Amazon basin and another month getting to know the rest of 
Brazil. He invested enough time and consideration in his story to do what 
reporters are supposed to do but usually don't. He has constructed a 
representation of "reality" in multiple dimensions, in which the characters 
have motivations -- often multiple and imperfect -- and in which both the good 
guys and the bad guys get to tell their own stories and show themselves to be 
quite human. He tells enough of the history of Brazil and the Amazon and 
provides enough data about the geography, ecology and resources of the Amazon 
for an American to begin to get the picture. 
</P>
<P>
The gist of this story concerns the first indigenous counterforce that has 
arisen in Brazil to stem the deforestation of the Amazon. Until quite recently, 
most of the pressure to conserve arose from foreign environmentalists, who had 
started by crying alarm and had progressed, with only slightly more success, to 
applying pressure on Brazil by getting to the vast flow of North American and 
European capital that not only fuels development but keeps the Brazilian 
economy from collapsing in red ink. 
</P>
<P>
As conservationists slowly have come to realize, environmental protection never 
really succeeds until it is adopted by local people. In Brazil, the only "local 
people" who have had any say have been members of the traditional Latin 
American clique of autocrats who, abetted by First World capital, have achieved 
vast wealth at the expense of both human and natural resources. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, one of the greatest sources of Brazilian wealth was latex 
painstakingly extracted from the native rubber trees of the Amazon rain forest 
by the seringueiros for slave wages, but sold on the international market at 
vast profit. In South America, rubber trees must grow as a relatively scarce 
element of the intact forest, or else they are attacked by pests and diseases. 
</P>
<P>
"The Burning Season" focuses on the efforts of Mendes and his compatriot rubber 
tappers to organize themselves for economic survival. Once, that meant 
eliminating the middlemen who sucked most of the profits from the raw-rubber 
trade. Now, it is preserving the very forest where these hardy folk have carved 
a sustainable niche from harvesting rubber and Brazil nuts. In this, the 
mixed-blood seringueiros have of late discovered a natural alliance with the 
Indians, who likewise require the forest to survive and who have had even less 
political power than the tappers. 
</P>
<P>
The ranchers, their wealthy sponsors and their local lackeys have represented 
traditional right-wing power; the tappers, as they have learned to organize 
politically, have therefore found themselves naturally allied with leftist 
revolutionary forces in Latin America. But to view this as a struggle between 
left and right is to miss much of the point and most of the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the myth that Greens have constructed around Mendes, he was never a 
Brazilian John Muir. But he was a quick study, and rapidly learned the 
connection between the protection of the tappers' way of life and larger global 
desires to protect the rain forest. Smart, well-read and charming, he led his 
dispersed flock to political awareness, to alliances first within Brazil and 
later beyond its borders. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its rich store of insight, "The Burning Season" does not reveal what 
will happen to the Amazon. Brazil has recently become more democratic; even the 
wealthy and relatively conservative new president has shown a strong interest 
in environmental preservation and in protecting indigenous, non-destructive 
uses of the forest. On the other hand, the forest continues to fall and burn at 
a fearsome clip, and the meager economics of latex and Brazil nuts are not 
sufficient to save it. What Revkin does offer, and it is substantial, is the 
understanding necessary for any of us who care to contribute to a solution.

RICHARD EDER: A PASSAGE FROM INDIA; 
</P>
<P>
THE JOURNEY BY INDIRA GANESAN (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $18.95; 175 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard Eder 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After years in the United States, where she was a chemistry professor, a 
widowed mother returns to her family home in Pi, a fictional island just off 
the South Coast of India. With her are her two daughters: Renu, a college 
student, and Manx, who is in high school. 
</P>
<P>
Out of this return, and the different things it means to each, Indira Ganesan 
has written a first novel that is something better than delicate, and something 
better than wise. There is a fine chiseling in the portraits of the hesitant 
Renu and the self-confident Manx, but it is the carving on two wands submitted 
to fire. And there is wisdom in what each goes through, but it is wisdom not 
conquered but struggled over. 
</P>
<P>
Ganesan, born in India and educated here, has taken the first-novel step of 
writing about what formed her. In this case it is two worlds, and the civil 
strife they ignite when inhabited by the same person. It means that Ganesan can 
write with a lovely balance not common to first novels. Memory calls up -- it 
has to -- both golden warmth and cool questioning. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone in "The Journey" -- Renu and Manx, their mother, Rukmani, and the 
extended family they find in the rambling country household -- is set off on a 
spectrum ranging from the reds and oranges of tradition to the blues and 
indigos of Westernization. 
</P>
<P>
There is the beautifully drawn character of the grandfather, who took to his 
bed years before on the grounds that Pi was about to sink, and that the most 
sensible course was to prepare for death. It was also the most comfortable; his 
"dying" makes the pleasantest of lives, solicitously attended by his children, 
strolling in the garden and making an occasional pilgrimage to the mainland 
just to check on the progress of world dissolution. 
</P>
<P>
There are Rukmani's highly traditional sisters, Bala and Chitri. There is her 
high-spirited brother, Adda, who traveled in Europe and brought back, to the 
family's horror, a Spanish wife. She soon died, though, and Adda occupies the 
traditional place of a bachelor uncle, with cheerfully free ideas and agreeably 
conservative ways. 
</P>
<P>
There is Amir, a former revolutionary once jailed for leading the Pi 
independence movement, who has settled down to manufacture umbrellas with 
erotic handle-carvings. There is a real estate developer who believes in 
American-style progress and regards even Europe as behind the times. "Paris is 
just another park of lost civilizations," he proclaims. 
</P>
<P>
The returning mother and her two young daughters are the moving figures across 
the family spectrum. They take their places perhaps too neatly; 
overexplicitness is a young author's apprenticeship, even one as good as 
Ganesan. 
</P>
<P>
Rukmani followed the lead of her husband -- also a scientist -- in living 
Western in the United States. She "moved through American life, tough as a 
pioneer, conquering dryers, parking meters, elevators, cellophane-packed goods. 
. . ." Ganesan writes. But widowhood reversed the current; the death of a 
nephew becomes her excuse for moving back and, once back, for taking up the 
mostly rooted of family roles. 
</P>
<P>
When Renu, for reasons we shall see, goes into extended depression, Rukmani 
suggests an age-old solution: an arranged marriage to a nice doctor or 
engineer. "She saw it as a party, a distracting, exciting spectacle that would 
take months of planning, shopping, issuing invitations, visiting, not to 
mention all the details to attend to in selecting a groom." 
</P>
<P>
On the other side is Manx, anchored to her life as perhaps only a 15-year-old 
needs to be. Her life, of course, is America: rock music, Cokes, high school, 
the future. She packs her suitcase with jars of peanut butter and eats it on 
store-bought white bread, while her uncle and aunts, her mother and sister are 
eating rice and dall. 
</P>
<P>
We see her sitting on the veranda plugged into her Walkman: "Self-absorbed, 
immensely bored, Manx had the ability to fall asleep anywhere, any time." It is 
a protection, a healthy one. Manx is the most clearly drawn of Ganesan's 
characters; we glimpse the generous and independent spirit that is taking shape 
between the Walkman's two earplugs. When a banana seller stops to chat -- as 
everyone does on Pi -- and begins to lament the death of her husband, years 
before, Ganesan writes: 
</P>
<P>
"The woman was rocking now, wringing her sadness out like water. Manx began to 
rock too." In that detail, we see that Manx will go back to America, will 
finish growing up American, and that her Indian identity will find ways to grow 
up too. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle, straddling the divided world and temporarily wrecked by it, is 
Renu. She is all openness, all ears, all readiness to be reclaimed by her 
roots. For her, the journey to Pi is, specifically, a journey to a childhood 
with which she has never come to terms. 
</P>
<P>
Rajesh, her dead cousin, haunts her. They were intimate playmates before Renu's 
family moved to America; they studied Sanskrit and read comics together; they 
were like twins. He died in a train that skidded off a bridge into the water. 
And the Indian saying goes: "If one twin dies by water, the other will die by 
fire." 
</P>
<P>
Renu feels herself pulled back into the family tradition. She half-welcomes it; 
she dreams continually of Rajesh; he seems to be holding her. But something 
resists, as well. Slipping into tradition suggests slipping into the saying. 
</P>
<P>
When her mother prattles about marriage, Renu dreams of a line of girls with 
apes as consorts. The result is a long spell of catatonic depression. At the 
end, after a series of reluctant moves and encounters, Renu will come out of it 
quite suddenly. She too will resume her American life; for her there can no 
longer be a place for the Indian life that came so close to extinguishing her. 
</P>
<P>
There is a certain tidiness in the scheme, in the growing-up, in the lessons 
learned. This is a minor flaw, the legginess of the writer as thoroughbred 
colt. And in some ways, perhaps, the tidiness actually helps us find our way 
through the Indian world that Ganesan locates with such nuance between beauty 
and oppression. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a sample. The family is sitting in the garden; the grandfather has 
disappeared on one of his pilgrimages. We see it through Manx's eyes: 
</P>
<P>
"She went outside, where most of the family had gathered. Long incense sticks 
were lit to keep the mosquitoes away, and someone was spraying bug repellent. 
The neighborhood was awake, the season too hot for sleep during a government 
current-rationing blackout. A murmur of voices drifted near the gate as 
neighbors patroled the area to make sure everyone was suffering equally. A card 
table was set up and a deck was cut. 
</P>
<P>
"Manx imagined that this tableau would last forever. That her aunts would 
always chatter and gossip, her sister remain catatonic, her grandfather absent. 
If she were to hold her breath, if she never uttered another sound, it would 
still be the same. The moon flicked in and out of the clouds, soundlessly 
fishing the sky. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a sudden rattle at the gate, a shuffle of feet. Her grandfather 
stood before them, returned from his trek. He had dried sandalwood paste on his 
arms, red and ash powder on his forehead. His feet were dirty and swollen. 
</P>
<P>
" 'The island is sinking,' he announced. 'The god told me there is nothing to 
be done.' "

ON THE GRAND TOUR WITH CANALETTO; 
</P>
<P>
CANALETTO BY KATHERINE BAETJER AND J.G. LINKS (METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART, 
HARRY N. ABRAMS, DISTRIBUTOR: $60; 387 PP., 167 COLOR ILLUSTRATIONS, 13 
BLACK-AND-WHITE; 0-8109-3155-9) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bernard Barryte, Barryte is curator of European art at the Memorial Art 
Gallery of the University of Rochester. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 18th Century was the age of the Grand Tour, and one product of the new 
passion for travel was the proliferation of view paintings (vedute), which 
recorded specific and recognizable sites. Among the foremost masters of the 
genre was the prolific Venetian painter, Giovanni Antonio Canal, called 
Canaletto (1697-1768), whose work caused his first patrons to marvel: "You can 
see the sun shining in it." 
</P>
<P>
The artist's reputation was established by his luminous views of Venice, though 
he was equally proficient in creating imaginary, but plausible, landscapes. The 
perfect congruence between his talents and contemporary taste was recognized 
first by Owen McSwiney and then by Joseph Smith. These enterprising gentlemen 
promoted Canaletto's paintings among British collectors, who cherished these 
dazzling mementos of the most opulent city on the Grand Tour. 
</P>
<P>
In 1746, the artist traveled to England where he remained for about 10 years. 
He expanded his repertoire to include portraits of London and the estates of 
the aristocrats who were his most consistent patrons. His sketchbooks allowed 
him to paint Venetian scenes while in England and to paint British scenes when 
he returned to his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
Today, his pictures are generally appreciated not only for their intrinsic 
charm but also as records of England before London cannibalized its 
countryside, and as tantalizing visions that recall the splendors of Venice 
prior to the depredations of pollution. But as this handsome book effectively 
demonstrates, Canaletto's paintings transcend their utility as topographical 
records. Their beauty reflects the vitality and geometric clarity of the 
artist's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"Canaletto" is the catalogue for the exhibition organized by the author, a 
curator at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, in collaboration with the 
eminent British scholar, J. G. Links. Because Canaletto's oeuvre has been 
authoritatively established in W. G. Constable's catalogue raisonne (revised by 
Links in 1989), the authors were not concerned with questions of attribution or 
with the need to distinguish his work from that of other view painters, as in 
Vittorio Moschini's 1954 monograph. Rather, they address issues raised as early 
as 1771, when Antonio Zanetti the Younger assessed the artist's accomplishment: 
"Canaletto combined nature and artistic license with such skill that his works 
appear to be absolutely accurate." But the Venetian connoisseur emphasized that 
this is an illusion achieved by disciplined artistry. 
</P>
<P>
Katherine Baetjer and Links bypass the beguiling subjects that make Canaletto's 
paintings so deceptively accessible and explore the intellectually rigorous 
structure and meticulous craftsmanship that underlie their capacity to 
fascinate. 
</P>
<P>
In support of this enterprise, the authors offer an impeccable selection of 
acknowledged masterpieces. The 85 paintings and 42 drawings all are reproduced 
in beautiful color plates, which make the volume a visual delight. Detailed 
catalogue entries provide information on the patrons and provenance of each 
object and on the history of the landmarks, noting especially the artist's 
revisions of visible reality. 
</P>
<P>
Five introductory essays discuss Canaletto's reputation and analyze the methods 
by which he consistently engages our imagination. Links incorporates a lifetime 
of study in a biographical sketch that reveals much about Canaletto's relations 
with his patrons. 
</P>
<P>
The essay by Michael Levey, former director of the National Gallery, London, 
emphasizes the imaginative artistry underlying the "powerfully factual air" and 
"pattern-making precision" that constitute the hallmarks of Canaletto's style. 
Levey characterizes Canaletto as an idealizing rather than as a 
representational painter, arguing that he consistently "asserted his artistic 
right to modify" the facts of visual reality in the interest of creating a 
picture while retaining "the general air of verisimilitude in the finished 
work." Furthermore, the organization of actual and invented details is entirely 
"subordinated to the major concern with coherent composition." Topographical 
facts are manipulated as part of the comprehensive reordering that is essential 
to the harmonious reality created within each picture. 
</P>
<P>
The insights offered by Viola Pemberton-Pigott, senior restorer for the Royal 
Collection, derive from her microscopic scrutiny of individual paintings. She 
draws attention to the mechanical devices that Canaletto employed to achieve an 
illusion of crystalline perfection and describes his technique of "sculpting" 
in paint to enhance the naturalistic appearance of surfaces. Most surprising is 
her observation that the brilliant luminosity and coloristic effects for which 
Canaletto is famous are actually achieved with a very limited palette. 
</P>
<P>
Surveying his career, the conservator confirms Levey's remarks regarding 
Canaletto's Cezanne-like devotion to the mastery of composition. She concludes 
that Canaletto "deliberately rejected the brand of realism that had 
characterized his early painting. He passed from the meticulous observation of 
every detail to exploring the scope of composition within color, pattern and 
texture, and the extreme stylization of his later works became a further stage 
of Canaletto's unflagging creativity." 
</P>
<P>
Altogether this is a wonderful book. The texts complement the multitude of 
illustrations, enhancing our appreciation for the sparkling pictures by 
revealing the sophisticated artistry Canaletto carefully veiled. 
</P>
<P>
My only quibble is that throughout there are references to prints by and after 
Canaletto, and some effort should have been made to include relevant examples. 
Otherwise, this substantial volume admirably serves the artist it celebrates.

FICTION IN BRIEF: MIRACLES IN AMERICA BY SHEILA KOHLER (ALFRED A. KNOPF: 
$18.95; 175 PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
Sheila Kohler was born in South Africa, studied psychology in Paris and lives 
in New York. The 13 short stories in this collection don't reflect that 
experience directly so much as transform it into dreams. 
</P>
<P>
Like dreams, Kohler's stories have sharp details and vague outlines. They are 
narrow and obsessive, yet hint at wider meanings. Like dreamers, her 
characters, mostly women and children, float almost devoid of context in 
generic, mostly urban settings, in privileged comfort, in a subtle but 
all-pervading malaise, sometimes in myths of somebody else's making. 
</P>
<P>
"The odd thought struck me . . . that I had before me, leaning over me, 
breathing down on me, Snow White's stepmother." The narrator, a patient in a 
Swiss hospital, rejects this idea as "a passing fancy." The older woman is 
recruiting her as a "distraction," possibly sexual, for a distinguished local 
couple. There are no obvious parallels with the fairy tale, but the patient has 
hair "almost the color of ebony"; there is mention of "the shiny apple" that 
"promised nothing favorable," and the story ends with the patient falling 
unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
The creature on the living-room rug at night that seems to be drawing a young 
South African girl into a terrifying embrace may be the tokolosh, the evil 
spirit mentioned by a black servant boy, but its "small beringed hands" are 
those of the girl's mother. The landowner in a tropical country who displays 
his wife's corpse to a visitor almost certainly murdered her. The wife in Paris 
who spies on her husband's rendezvous with another woman later dances with what 
may be the same woman and feels that she has healed the breach in her marriage. 
The middle-aged scientist who experiments with the restorative effects of snake 
venom is herself strangely rejuvenated by two sinister men who rent her an 
apartment and entangle her in marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Individually, these stories are striking, if sometimes hard to interpret. 
Together, they strike much the same notes over and over. Only rarely does 
Kohler indulge us with sharp, realistic dialogue and even humor -- a quality 
that she usually keeps tightly bandaged, under wraps.

FICTION IN BRIEF: RELIABLE LIGHT BY MEREDITH STEINBACH (RUTGERS UNIVERSITY 
PRESS: $18.95; 160 PP.)

<P>
Short stories can be bad, good or, in rare cases, magical. This collection of 
seven by Meredith Steinbach consists of five good ones and two that are better 
than good; they leave dents in the bumpers of the reader's mind that defy 
simple hammering out. 
</P>
<P>
Steinbach also is a novelist ("Zara" and "Here Lies the Water"), and her 
stories have a novelistic amplitude. They enfold periods of years, crowds of 
characters, generations of families, without obsessive concern that every scene 
be immediately relevant or that every unnecessary word be pruned. This is 
confident writing. 
</P>
<P>
True, three of the longer stories are, perhaps, too novelistic. A young woman 
divines the truth about her enigmatic mother when she returns to the Midwest 
for her grandfather's funeral. Another young woman is stunned by loved ones' 
deaths and dispirited by the effort of living in a sodden, Seattle-like city 
where the sun never shines. Residents of an island in New England watch as a 
Vietnam veteran re-creates the kind of tragedy he has spent years trying to 
forget. The many virtues of these stories -- a quirkiness, a tenderness, a 
solid sense of place -- just don't happen to include perfection. 
</P>
<P>
But one of the shorter stories -- about an immigrant woman trapped with her 
lover in a Chicago hotel fire -- is seamless; the fire is both real and a 
symbol of her oppression outside, and we are left uncertain that she will 
escape. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are the magical ones: 
</P>
<P>
"Soundings in Feet and Fathoms" is told by a black doctor who has moved from 
Harlem to a small New England town, only to be trailed by the bloodhounds of 
racism. Bigoted parents refuse to let him operate on a boy, who dies; the 
doctor is blamed, and his own son is tormented at school. Steinbach has found 
this man a voice, recognizably black and male but jarringly unorthodox and 
individual, that speaks to his son -- and to us -- with humanity and power. 
</P>
<P>
"Actual Oil" is a comic fable about three women who own a farm. The youngest 
runs off with a con man with "electronic eyes" who calls himself Hermes, after 
the cunning, silver-tongued herald of the gods. Even after she returns home, 
the older women must protect her from his charms. "Where are you anyway?" she 
asks when he phones to announce that he has completed a two-day encounter 
workshop and been "actualized." "I am here in myself, where I am always at 
home," Hermes answers in perfect-pitch psychobabble. "Temporarily I'm in 
Nashville." The pitch stays perfect; the story is quietly, steadily, grinningly 
funny -- on the road of reading, another fine thing to run into.

AS CRIME GOES BY BY DIANE K. SHAH (BANTAM BOOKS: $3.95; 336 PP.; 0-553-28310-3)

Paris Chandler is the latest in the growing field of female crime 
investigators. She is not, however, a cop, a private eye or even a crime 
reporter. She is a "legman," as she ironically calls herself, for Etta Rice, 
the Los Angeles Examiner's queenly gossip columnist. 
</P>
<P>
The time is 1947, which allows for many nostalgic touches by author Diane K. 
Shah, who worked, much later than that, as a sports reporter for that 
newspaper. For example, she has Ira Gershwin playing show tunes at a Bel-Air 
party while guests sing along. One of the characters owns a Nash Rambler. The 
in-places are Chasen's and Mocambo. And after buying lunch for a subject, 
Chandler says: "I reached for the check. A dollar fifty for the sandwiches. 
Twenty-five cents for the pie and tea. Lauralee Hart had been an expensive 
interview." 
</P>
<P>
Also, she has some nice descriptive bits: "Lauralee was one of those Veronica 
Lake look-alikes who spent half the day sweeping hair out of her eyes and the 
other half giving all of her hair a good overall toss." 
</P>
<P>
The plot centers on the murder of Anne Bardon, a starlet who is found shot to 
death on Santa Monica Beach. She is one of a string of would-be actresses kept 
by director Jack Seeberg. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler is involved because a woman purporting to be Mrs. Seeberg had called 
on her at the Examiner and asked her to plant an item suggesting that she was 
having an affair. Evidently she wanted to humiliate her husband. 
</P>
<P>
A few days later, when Anne Bardon's body is found, Chandler sees it in the 
morgue and realizes Anne Bardon was her Mrs. Seeberg. She does not tell the 
cops, which is the first of her many blithe transgressions of law and ethics. 
</P>
<P>
Aided by her fellow legman, Nick Goodwin, a rather charming but feckless Ivy 
Leaguer who wants to be a screenwriter, Chandler uses her job to question 
everybody concerned, including Seeberg, Mrs. Seeberg and the several women on 
Seeberg's string. Chandler also has the unwanted help of Tee (Theodora) Jones, 
a flamboyant ex-hooker turned private eye. 
</P>
<P>
At various stages of her investigation Chandler wants to write a news story for 
the paper but is frustrated by the sexist city editor, who calls her "the girl 
in the dresses," and assigns the story to a man (who gets it wrong). 
</P>
<P>
Though it reeks of a licentious Hollywood novel, the book has no explicit sex 
scenes. Chandler evidently has been celibate since the death of her husband in 
a freak accident. Paris Chandler's parents are rich Bel-Air socialites, and she 
gets around in a chauffeur-driven Bentley. 
</P>
<P>
Though it is never related to this story's murders, the notorious Black Dahlia 
murder of 1947 is given prominent attention, probably as a metaphor for the 
times. Also, the press hysteria over Elizabeth Short's murder keeps driving 
Chandler's story off the front page and diverts the attention of the cops. 
</P>
<P>
There are occasional bits of saucy dialogue: 
</P>
<P>
"Are you a vegetarian?" I asked politely. 
</P>
<P>
"No," said Yvette. "I'm a Gemini." 
</P>
<P>
And when Chandler shows her naivete by asking a sportswriter whether it's 
libelous to call the Dodgers "Dem Bums," he responds, without even looking up 
from his typewriter: "You ask me, it's libelous to call 'em a baseball team."

DEPRAVITY IN DREAMLAND; 
</P>
<P>
L.A. CONFIDENTIAL BY JAMES ELLROY (MYSTERIOUS PRESS: $19.95; 512 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dick Roraback, Roraback is a member of the Book Review staff.

<TEXT>
<P>
Almost everybody in "L.A. Confidential" dies. Those who don't wish they had. 
</P>
<P>
In the incontinent mayhem that masquerades as a James Ellroy novel, the line 
between the quick and the dead is fine. Only the ungrateful deceased are 
permitted to rest -- in pieces, most likely; in hell for sure. For the living, 
it's just a question of time. 
</P>
<P>
Dead or alive, nobody is clean. Sasquatch-sized skeletons spook every closet: 
</P>
<P>
Edmund Exley -- protagonist only by virtue of longevity -- is a Los Angeles 
Police Department comer. He is billed as a war hero. Actually, what he had done 
in the war, Daddy, was to artfully arrange a row of Japanese corpses, fry away 
the evidence with a flame-thrower, and accept the Distinguished Service Cross 
with understandable modesty. 
</P>
<P>
Preston Exley, the father for whose approval Ed lusts, has retired, with 
laurels, from the force. He is now L.A.'s prime contractor, the man who built 
Dream-a-Dreamland (read Disneyland) and most of the freeways. Preston did not 
earn his stake by putting bad people in the pokey. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Dieterling (read Walt Disney), animated-cartoon pioneer and Dreamland 
godfather, has corrupted one son and murdered another, whose name is 
immortalized in a Dreamland ride. 
</P>
<P>
Jack (Trashcan) Vincennes, also LAPD, is called the "celebrity crimestopper," a 
scabrous sobriquet earned from paid and publicized drug busts of the likes of 
Robert Mitchum and Charlie (Yardbird) Parker (whom Vincennes frames, then 
stuffs into a garbage bin; hence Trashcan). He also has terminated two 
innocents while he was high on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Bud White -- LAPD, what else? -- is a time bomb in blue, ever since his father 
cuffed him to a bed, made him watch while Dad beat Mom to death with a tire 
iron, left them both to rot for a week. Bud is somewhat short-tempered with 
woman-beaters, notably with a gentleman from Eagle Rock whose arm Bud jams into 
a churning garbage disposal. 
</P>
<P>
Even the fringe felons are given a certain panache by Ellroy -- bass player 
Burt Perkins is affectionately known as "Deuce" for his "two-spot on a chain 
gang: unnatural acts against dogs" -- while the real-life extras in the 
'50s-vintage novel have distinctive personalities of their own: Johnny 
Stompanato, who, in fact and fiction, is knifed to death by Lana Turner's 
daughter; mobster Mickey Cohen, safe in the pen, who has the only good lines in 
the book ("I have never killed no man that did not deserve killing by the 
standards of our way of life"). 
</P>
<P>
The plot, faster than a stray bullet and equally random, ricochets about two 
police cases -- one past, one present, each bearing on the other. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier crime -- the "solving" of which earned Preston Exley his wings -- 
is a surpassingly grisly attempt by two maniacs to surgically assemble a 
"perfect" human being from the body parts of slain children. 
</P>
<P>
The more recent abomination is a shotgun massacre at the Nite Owl Coffee Shop. 
Ed Exley draws this assignment. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from Chief William Parker (the same), Exley corrals three black 
men, who happen to have perfect alibis: At the time Nite Owl was going down, 
they were gang-raping a kidnaped Latina and "selling her out" to their friends. 
Unimpressed, young Exley butchers all three -- who are, incidentally, unarmed 
-- and earns yet another promotion. 
</P>
<P>
Among other depravities linking the two cases is a porn ring that features -- 
hang in there -- mother-son incest on roller skates! 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Ellroy spares no sensibilities. By Page 25 of a long and chaotic 
tale, he has offended every color, creed or kink known to man. With equal 
disdain, he eschews verbs, nouns, adjectives as obstacles to his unique 
narrative flow. What is lost in clarity is recouped in concision: One Ellroy 
paragraph is tantamount to a page, even a chapter in more measured parables. To 
wit: 
</P>
<P>
"Bud packed up, got out, brainstormed some more -- pimp war clicks, clickouts 
-- Duke Cathcart had two skags in his stable, no stomach for pushing a 
14-year-old nymphet -- he was a pimp disaster area. He tried to click Duke's 
pad tossed to the Nite Owl -- no gears meshed, odds on the (blacks) remained 
high. If the tossing played, tie it to Cathcart's 'new' gig -- Feather Royko 
talked it up -- she came off clean as Sinful Cindy came off hinky. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Got that? If you have, and if Ellroy hasn't yet driven you to droolsville, 
you'll doubtless identify with one Timmy Valburn, the man under Dreamland's 
"Moochie Mouse" suit: 
</P>
<P>
"Jack," says Timmy during interrogation, "I'm tres Hollywood. I dress up as a 
rodent to entertain children. Nothing surprises me."

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE BUS OF DREAMS BY MARY MORRIS (PENGUIN: $7.95)

<TEXT>
<P>
A collection of competent but uninvolving stories reprinted from various 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Morris can put words together in ways that suggest a character or set a 
mood, but these brief vignettes involving alcoholic fathers, quarreling 
families and unhappy lovers lack a distinguishing voice. The stories seem 
vaguely familiar, as if the reader had skimmed them in the dentist's waiting 
room a few weeks earlier. If such a thing as generic fiction exists, Morris has 
pioneered it.

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE 1990 DOONESBURY STAMP ALBUM BY GARRY TRUDEAU (PENGUIN: 
$8.95)

Unlike most contemporary cartoonists, Garry Trudeau has stubbornly resisted 
attempts to merchandise his strip. The first "Doonesbury" license product was 
created to raise money for "Writers' Voices," a national program that provides 
accessible reading material to the 27 million American adults who are 
illiterate or have only limited reading skills. 
</P>
<P>
This spoof of a conventional stamp album allows Trudeau an opportunity to show 
off his skill as a graphic artist. The cleverly designed pseudo-stamps include 
images of his familiar characters (Zonker darkens like a roasting Thanksgiving 
turkey as his tan deepens from "Gaucho Glow" to "Malibu Melt") and a series of 
mordant lampoons of George Bush. A map showing the homes of the regular 
"Doonesbury" cast includes special graphic symbols indicating Elvis sightings, 
oil spills, Geraldo-free zones and Towns Without Pity.

Romanian-born poet Andrei Codrescu offers his sardonic reflections on the 
follies and inconsistencies of contemporary culture in this anthology of 
commentaries from NPR's "All Things Considered." Codrescu has an eye for the 
off-beat image. 
</P>
<P>
In the title essay, he muses on the giant puppets used to teach tame sandhill 
cranes how to socialize with wild birds, and turns the experiment into a 
metaphor for the problems of human communication. In one of his more outrageous 
pieces, he suggests that Americans eliminate the federal deficit by fining 
themselves 5 cents "every time they use the F-word." ("Eddie Murphy . . . who 
has never spoken a whole sentence without using the F-word five or six times, 
would contribute quite a good deal. From each according to his needs.") These 
concise essays are both entertaining and thought-provoking, but it's impossible 
for anyone who's listened to "All Things Considered" to read them without 
hearing the author's distinctive, nasal voice.

A droll comedy of manners, set in a provincial English village. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Thornby, the daughter of a determinedly eccentric (and possibly 
incestuous) family, takes up Claud Bannister, an unprepossessing man 20-odd 
years her junior, the way a more normal woman might take up embroidery or 
raising African violets. With smug aplomb, she bullies him into declaring his 
independence from his mother and pursuing his goal of becoming a writer. Laura 
enjoys meddling in Claud's life so much, it never occurs to her he might have 
talent. She discovers his ability and the hollowness of her much vaunted 
independence in a comeuppance that is richly deserved and tartly amusing.

DEATH SQUADS KILL BRAZIL'S CRIME-PRONE STREET KIDS 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
DUQUE DE CAXIAS, Brazil 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cleiton, 12, used to steal from the stores in a shopping gallery near the 
center of Duque de Caxias, one of the grimy, violent suburbs on the sprawling 
northern outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. He belonged to the ragged legion of 
street kids who live by their wits and sometimes die by the gun. 
</P>
<P>
Cleiton's killers caught up with him one night last January as he slept on a 
sidewalk near the gallery. A boy called A.G., who knew Cleiton, tells the story 
in a few words. 
</P>
<P>
"He was sleeping," A.G. said, "and they filled his face with bullets." 
</P>
<P>
Cleiton's death was not an isolated incident. Hundreds of deprived and 
delinquent Brazilian minors are killed every year. 
</P>
<P>
According to people who monitor the situation, an alarming number of youngsters 
are killed by "extermination groups" -- death squads bent on cleaning up 
crime-plagued areas. 
</P>
<P>
Death squads have been at work for years in Brazil, but concern has risen in 
the past year because of the number of youngsters being killed, not only in Rio 
but also in other urban areas, including Sao Paulo and Recife. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, young people are too frightened to talk about the situation, but 
A.G., a thin, dark boy with shy eyes and fluffy curls, agreed reluctantly to 
meet a reporter if two women he trusts, a Roman Catholic nun and a social 
worker, could be present. 
</P>
<P>
They met in a church-sponsored center where street children can come for a free 
meal, a warm shower, basic schooling and kind encouragement. A.G., in a soiled 
blue soccer shirt, faded shorts and rubber sandals, kept his eyes on the table 
in front of him and fiddled with a piece of plastic tape as he talked. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is afraid," he said. He said he had known "a heap" of youngsters 
killed in Duque de Caxias. One was Luciano, 16, picked up by his killers in 
January and shot in the head. His body was dumped on a hill behind the 
cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
"He robbed stores," A.G. said of Luciano. "During the day he would study the 
store, and at night he would go in through a window and clean it out." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after Luciano's death, gunmen killed his friend Ademir, 16. "He also 
robbed," A.G. said. 
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt, he insisted, about who the killers work for. "The store 
owners pay them to kill us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A.G. has slept in the streets for 11 of his 16 years. He said the killers 
almost got him when he was 13. 
</P>
<P>
"I was asleep, and they threw me into a car," he recalled. "They took me to the 
valao (an open sewage canal that runs through Duque de Caxias), and told me to 
jump in. I jumped and fell down in the dirt. Then I got up and ran, and they 
fired a shot that hit me in the leg." 
</P>
<P>
He showed a small scar below his right knee where he said the bullet grazed 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt the pain," he said, "and I went running to the train station and the 
railroad police. They protected me." 
</P>
<P>
Sister Beatriz Semiano listened as the boy talked, and she confirmed the 
dangers he described. 
</P>
<P>
"He lives in the street, he sleeps in the street, and he is threatened with 
death," she said. "It is a terrible problem in Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
Sister Beatriz and others who are concerned about the killing say the problem 
has its roots in urban poverty, antiquated laws, police corruption and 
ineffective systems for providing child welfare and criminal justice. 
</P>
<P>
To survive, many street children turn to petty crime. By the time they reach 
their teens, some are involved in serious crime: drugs, burglary, armed 
robbery. 
</P>
<P>
By law, offenders under the age of 18 cannot be brought to trial, and few are 
held for long at low-security detention centers. Some simply walk away, and 
some are let out because of overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants, driven to desperation by robberies, hire private security guards, 
many of them off-duty or former policemen, who take the law into their own 
hands and eliminate criminals of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
In some slums, drug gangs provide security for merchants, killing robbers and 
thieves. The gangs fight one another, too, and sometimes kill their own people 
for violating strict codes of loyalty and secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
Often it is hard to say who is behind a killing, a gang or an extermination 
group. Wolmer do Nascimento, a coordinator for the National Movement for Street 
Boys and Girls, which works with abandoned children in several Brazilian 
cities, said there are 10 groups, "more or less," at work in Duque de Caxias. 
</P>
<P>
Tiana Se, who is also a coordinator for the movement, said that death squads 
hired to eliminate thieves and muggers from tourist districts of Rio -- 
Copacabana and Ipanema -- often dump their victims' bodies in the northern 
suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
Se, a public schoolteacher with children of her own, said the killers of 
juvenile delinquents "are applauded because society says they are bandits -- 
nothing can be done with them." 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is getting worse all the time," she said. "The number of deaths is 
increasing." 
</P>
<P>
Official statistics are generally imprecise and incomplete, but several recent 
studies show that a significant number of youngsters are being killed and that 
the problem is spreading. 
</P>
<P>
One shows that 184 children younger than 18 were killed by firearms in Duque de 
Caxias and the neighboring municipality of Nova Iguacu in 1987 and the first 
half of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A private research center, the Brazilian Institute of Social and Economic 
Analysis, went through newspapers in 10 states and found 81 reports of minors 
killed by death squads in the first half of 1989. The institute is working on a 
study that covers all of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Other figures show that more than 110 young people, all under 18, have been 
killed "execution style" so far this year in metropolitan Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
Gilberto Dimenstein, an investigative reporter, estimates that killers are 
reducing the number of Brazil's young people at the rate of more than one a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent book, "The War of the Children," Dimenstein says that sometimes a 
child is killed to eliminate a potential witness, because minors in 
crime-ridden neighborhoods "know the names of policemen or bandits involved in 
crimes and (death) squads." 
</P>
<P>
In his book, Dimenstein asks a man he identifies as a former death-squad killer 
if he has killed children, and the man responds: 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody here asks the one he is going to kill for identification papers. A 
bandit is a bandit, whether he is 10, 15 or 40 years old." 
</P>
<P>
Liborni Siqueira, one of only two juvenile judges in Rio de Janeiro, a city of 
7 million people, says he deals with 15 cases a day involving juvenile 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
He criticized the juvenile detention system for not giving its wards work and 
discipline, and for functioning as a revolving door. 
</P>
<P>
"Minors enter and leave in quick succession," he said. "Whoever wants to can 
escape at will." He said some repeat offenders are brought before him as many 
as 30 times. 
</P>
<P>
Tania Moreira, a public prosecutor in the Duque de Caxias criminal courts, said 
death squads serve as a brutal form of control over a chaotic social 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
"When you kill a street boy, first, you take out one of the worst ones, and you 
also give an example to the others that helps control them, keep them in line," 
she said. "You are exercising social control through fear." 
</P>
<P>
Moreira said that in most death-squad killings, "we never find out who did it." 
No one has been charged in 688 of the 919 homicide cases registered last year 
in Duque de Caxias. 
</P>
<P>
Death-squad convictions are rare, she said. Witnesses are threatened and 
sometimes killed. 
</P>
<P>
The judiciary is also susceptible to pressures, she said. She showed a reporter 
documents relating to the case of Marcio Rodrigues Machado, 15, who in June, 
1989, was abducted from his home by hooded men, beaten and shot in the head. 
Last month, Moreira charged three policemen with the slaying and asked a 
criminal court judge to order their arrest. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Rubem Medeiros refused. He held that "the seriousness of the crime, 
in itself, does not give rise to the necessity of preventive imprisonment." 
</P>
<P>
At present, 27 men face trial on charges involving death-squad killings in 
Duque de Caxias. Some trials are scheduled to begin in August, and some of the 
people who have been charged are in jail, but others are free on their own 
recognizance or are fugitives. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the 27 are security guards, some are petty merchants and three are 
policemen, prosecutor Moreira said. 
</P>
<P>
All these cases were brought by a special commission of the state investigative 
police. Inspector Eide Trindade de Lima, who heads the commission, said it 
could do more if it weren't for the fear of witnesses in death-squad cases. 
</P>
<P>
"People are afraid to come in here," Trindade told a reporter across his desk 
in a downtown Rio squad room. 
</P>
<P>
He said death squads go unpunished because the justice system is slow, 
inefficient and easily influenced, while "exaggerated formalism" in the 
Brazilian criminal code ties the hands of investigators and prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to blame the whole legal system," he said. "Our legislation is a 
joke." 
</P>
<P>
Trindade confirmed that members of extermination groups are usually "persons 
who collect from merchants for acting as security guards." 
</P>
<P>
"Before," he said, "the merchants sought out the security guards. Now the 
security guards seek out the merchants." 
</P>
<P>
Rampant criminal activity, he said, is the result of social and economic misery 
that turns abandoned children into criminals. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the government is not providing a solution," he said, "people there seek 
another solution, which is violence, the law of the strongest. As long as that 
(continues), new bandits will appear. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to work, but we don't have hope that the picture will 
change."

PUSH TO POP THE TAX BUBBLE SPARKS DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On its surface, nothing could be more absurd. No matter how much money a highly 
paid corporate executive makes, his federal income tax rate will never exceed 
28%. Meanwhile, a successful university professor with lower earnings of 
$100,000 a year must pay an extra $330 in taxes for every additional $1,000 he 
makes on the lecture circuit. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent unfairness of this "bubble" in the tax code, under which families 
with taxable income between roughly $75,000 and $210,000 face a 33% tax rate on 
a portion of their income while those earning more pay a flat 28% but lose some 
of their basic deductions, has become a staple of Democratic political rhetoric 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
"The highest-income people should be paying the highest tax rate, and not the 
people who are a step below," said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.). "In 
correcting that, we are not creating a new tax." 
</P>
<P>
Congress created the confusing bubble in the tax code as part of the sweeping 
1986 tax revision. It established a "phantom" tax rate of 33% to enable the 
government to phase out certain tax benefits for the wealthy while keeping the 
official top income tax rate as low as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Complaints about the disparity get an especially receptive hearing among 
congressional lawmakers, whose own salaries -- and opportunities for lecture 
fees and other honorariums -- make them all but certain victims of the bubble. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, though, what's on the surface doesn't always reflect reality. 
Democrats have a good case that the tax system has become less progressive in 
the last decade -- but it's not because of the bubble. 
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, tax experts explain, the bubble was designed to prevent the 
wealthy from taking advantage of tax benefits available to everyone else, and 
it actually helps make the current system more taxing for the rich, not less. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people believe -- incorrectly -- that taxpayers subject to the 33% rate 
are being treated unfairly compared to higher-income taxpayers whose marginal 
rate is 28%," Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), one of the key architects of tax 
reform, pointed out in a recent letter to his Senate colleagues. "In fact, the 
'bubble' does not reward the rich . . . it enhances the tax system's 
progressivity." 
</P>
<P>
This paradox of the historic 1986 tax revision law is at the center of the 
current budget negotiations between the White House and Congress. Democrats are 
intent on trying to exact a greater share of taxes from the wealthy after a 
decade in which the overall tax burden generally was cut far more for the rich 
than for the poor and middle class. But rather than saying so explicitly, 
lawmakers prefer to focus the public's discontent on an all-too-confusing 
anomaly in the tax code. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, bursting the bubble has become the minimum price that Democrats 
are demanding for their acceptance of the Bush Administration's plan to cut 
taxes on capital gains -- the profits that come from the sale of capital 
investments such as stocks or real estate. That would boost taxes for those 
with incomes above $200,000, but it also would give it all back -- and more -- 
to many of the same people. 
</P>
<P>
Boosting the top rate to 33% for everyone in the upper bracket would raise 
about $42 billion over five years, taking all the money from the richest 
600,000 taxpayers with incomes above $200,000. On the other hand, a capital 
gains tax cut, while initially generating tax revenues by encouraging investors 
to sell some of their assets, would provide more than 60% of its tens of 
billions in benefits to the 1% of families earning more than $200,000, 
according to congressional tax specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, tax analysts say, whatever the economic benefits that might flow from 
reducing tax rates on capital gains, doing so also would heighten presure among 
the affluent to escape the higher general tax rates by converting ordinary 
income into investments. In fact, they contend, the perverse result of such a 
deal could well be to enhance the very unfairness and capriciousness that 
Democratic lawmakers say they want to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
Why does the bubble exist? To understand the issue, it helps to go back to the 
unusual political climate in 1986 that made tax revision possible. With 
Republicans in control of the White House and the Senate and Democrats 
dominating the House, few people expected a sweeping overhaul of the tax system 
to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
All but buried in the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, the tax reform 
corpse was revived in May, 1986, with a plan by then-Chairman Bob Packwood 
(R-Ore.) that eventually created only two basic rates -- 15% for lower-income 
taxpayers and 28% for upper-income taxpayers. (The old system had involved 14 
brackets, culminating in a top rate of 50%.) To keep a fair share of the tax 
burden on the affluent, however, the Packwood proposal eliminated or pared many 
of the loopholes used by the wealthy to slash their tax bills under the old 
system. 
</P>
<P>
But Congress went even further. Keeping the top rate well under 30% was 
critically important to the Republicans who were backing tax reform. Making 
sure that more-affluent taxpayers continued to pay a greater percentage of 
their income than those with lower income was essential to Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
As frequently is the case, the lawmakers settled on a gimmick that accomplished 
both goals: Wealthier taxpayers would lose the benefit of today's $2,050 
personal exemption and also give up the advantages of the 15% rate on their 
first $32,450 in income ($19,400 for singles). 
</P>
<P>
The end result is that the richest taxpayers have no personal exemptions and 
pay a flat 28% on all their taxable income. 
</P>
<P>
To phase out the tax benefits smoothly, the lawmakers saddled taxpayers in 
lower brackets (with incomes of roughly $75,000 to $210,000 for a family of 
four and $45,000 to $100,000 for singles) with a 5% surcharge on the portion of 
their income that falls within the bubble. Those taxpayers pay a higher 
marginal rate of 33% on part of their income, but they also retain some of the 
benefits of the personal exemption and the 15% rate, so that their average tax 
rate is always lower than the maximum 28%. 
</P>
<P>
The bottom line is that the bubble helps ensure that a person's effective 
income tax burden still rises with his income, maintaining the modest 
progressivity of the federal tax system. 
</P>
<P>
"The irony is that the reformers who built more progressivity into the code are 
now being attacked for doing the right thing," said Norman Ornstein, a 
congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute here. "But few 
people understand that this was not some crazy anomaly put in there to give an 
extra break to the rich." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all that, the bubble still has become a symbol of unfairness in the tax 
code. While Republicans would like to leave income tax rates alone in the 
current budget negotiations, Democrats believe that the bubble provides them 
the most powerful lever for extracting a tax increase from the well-to-do. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush is determined to lower capital gains tax rates on long-term 
investments to 20% because he thinks a change would enhance economic growth. 
Although most congressional Democrats oppose such a rate cut as a giveaway to 
the rich, many concede that the White House is likely to get its wish. 
</P>
<P>
So now that Bush is prepared to junk the basic trade-off of lower rates for 
fewer loopholes that was embodied in the 1986 tax revision law, most Democrats 
see no reason to preserve it, either. The result may be to impose slightly 
higher tax rates on the rich, while restoring their favorite tax break -- a 
reduction in tax rates for capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
By eliminating many of the tax breaks that invited abuse and kept hordes of tax 
lawyers busy helping people and corporations minimize their taxes, the 1986 law 
significantly improved the progressivity of the tax system. 
</P>
<P>
But it was not enough to overcome the regressive impact of the huge 1981 tax 
cut -- which showered most of its benefits on the affluent and corporate 
shareholders -- and the 1983 Social Security changes, which ushered in a wave 
of payroll tax increases that landed most heavily on middle-income Americans. 
</P>
<P>
Although the White House and congressional Republicans are searching for other 
ways to tax high-income Americans that might well enhance progressivity -- such 
as imposing a small tax on stock transactions or further paring back the 
business-meal deduction -- the goal of eliminating the bubble remains at the 
top of the Democratic agenda. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Byrle M. Abbin, the top tax specialist in the Washington office of 
Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm, captures the full irony of today's 
debate. "The bubble," he said, "may be the first tax provision ever repealed 
simply because it was hard to explain why and how it works."

Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev halted a hunt for scapegoats in his 
Kremlin leadership Saturday with a display of power and political skill, 
reining in belligerent conservatives who accused his top lieutenants of driving 
the nation to the brink of ruin. 
</P>
<P>
After delegates to the 28th Communist Party Congress excoriated two key 
reformers and voted to call each member of the leadership to personal account 
for the nation's crisis, Gorbachev countered with a schoolmasterly upbraiding 
and an instinct for retaining control. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to bury the party, to split the party, then continue on this 
course," Gorbachev reprimanded the delegates, warning them to "think, and to 
think hard." 
</P>
<P>
In the morning session, conservatives had pilloried Politburo members Alexander 
N. Yakovlev and Vadim A. Medvedev, two of Gorbachev's staunchest supporters, 
accusing them of errors that have cost the Communists power and influence 
throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
Fired by their success in rattling the once-untouchable ruling figures, the 
delegates, swept along by aggressive hard-liners, voted to assess each leader's 
role in the failure of reform. 
</P>
<P>
The reforms, inaugurated by Gorbachev five years ago amid much promise, have 
not only failed to improve living standards but have deepened economic troubles 
and inflicted the worst food crisis since World War II on the people. 
</P>
<P>
Disillusioned with the Communist Party's inability to stem the decline, 
hundreds of thousands of members have quit the party, once the pinnacle of 
prestige and privilege. 
</P>
<P>
From the outset of the congress, the nearly 4,700 delegates have held the party 
leadership responsible and questioned the wisdom of perestroika, Gorbachev's 
program of political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the angry delegates were able to question members of the party's 
Politburo directly, triggering the first real debate since the congress opened 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
One after another, Politburo members were summoned to the rostrum to answer the 
barbed and hostile questions of delegates, and by the end of the morning the 
congress had voted, nearly 2 to 1, to evaluate the performance of each member 
of the leadership over the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, moving to quell this conservative uprising and the challenge it 
represented to his own authority, took over chairmanship of the afternoon 
session and persuaded the majority of loyal or uncertain delegates to vote down 
separate report cards in favor of a statement on the leadership's collective 
guilt. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting criticism in a draft resolution the congress will consider Monday 
is a watered-down reprimand that has spared Gorbachev and his reform team an 
embarrassing exposure to further hostility. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's ability to control undulations of unrest among delegates who appear 
to be in search of an authoritative leader also was tested by repeated 
outbursts that disrupted speakers, including the president himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I am ashamed when this hall turns into a public free-for-all," Gorbachev said, 
chastising the delegates as they repeatedly challenged his maneuverings to 
deflect criticism and stay in command. 
</P>
<P>
The decision on assessing responsibility followed appearances by five Politburo 
members to answer questions from the delegates, who have been meeting in the 
Kremlin for nearly a week. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd was stirred up by Yegor K. Ligachev, a hard-line member of the 
Politburo, who lashed out at both foreign and domestic setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
He denounced moves to increase private property and speed the transition to a 
market economy, winning hearty applause for a suggestion that pro-market 
supporters should be the first to experience the unemployment such reforms are 
likely to spur. 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev also condemned German reunification and Baltic separatism. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest danger, comrades, comes from anti-socialist forces, from 
nationalists of all types, who in some republics are already restoring the 
bourgeois order," the Siberian conservative railed in a clear slap against the 
Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
Reunion of the two Germanys was a "swallowing" of East Germany by its Western 
brother, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev's words fueled a controversy that has surfaced repeatedly at the 
congress over the departure of Eastern European allies from the Communist 
flock. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze denied that East Germany "has been 
given to Bonn on a plate," warning that security relations among sovereign 
states are better founded on mutual interest than military force. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have blocked reunification by the use of our forces stationed in the 
German Democratic Republic," Shevardnadze said. "But what that would have meant 
is clear to anyone. And that is the answer to anyone who says we should not 
have allowed it." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev stepped in after the thunderous applause Shevardnadze won from the 
delegates to suggest calling an end to the time-consuming debate over each 
Politburo member's address to the congress. Winning the delegates' support on 
that easily, Gorbachev ordered a 30-minute break. 
</P>
<P>
Pressing ahead forcefully after the recess, he proposed a vote on collective 
assessment of the leadership's responsibility, getting the decision taken 
earlier in the day overturned by a vote of 2,495 to 1,545. 
</P>
<P>
Reform advocates said the reversal prevented the congress from giving a boost 
to conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
"Our Russian thirst for blood is showing," Inna Dementyeva, a delegate from 
Moscow, said, criticizing the effort to expose the leaders to individual 
account. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates on Monday will consider the general assessment of top-level 
culpability, a draft of which was introduced by Vladimir A. Ivashko, president 
of the Ukraine and a member of the party's Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
The party leadership "has not realized all possibilities for its radical 
transformation from the state party into the political leader," Ivashko read 
from the proposed resolution. "The Communist Party and party committees of all 
levels failed to restructure their work, to mobilize creative potential of 
party organizations." 
</P>
<P>
Yakovlev and Medvedev had been hounded by hard-liners in the raucous morning 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
Yakovlev, one of the leaders responsible for foreign policy, rejected 
delegates' accusations that he had contributed to the worldwide decline of 
socialist prestige. 
</P>
<P>
"If a people turns its back on the party, it is a matter for the people," the 
66-year-old Politburo member stated. 
</P>
<P>
Medvedev accused his critics of indulging in nostalgia for the uncontested 
power they held in the days of dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates had peppered them with biting questions about their role in 
democratic reforms that have led, in the view of conservatives, to a fall from 
grace for the party that once ruled without challenge. 
</P>
<P>
The new freedom of speech encouraged by Gorbachev's glasnost (openness) policy 
has brought government ministers and regional party bosses in for criticism, 
but few members of the party's upper echelon have ever experienced such public 
rebukes. 
</P>
<P>
Both Yakovlev and Medvedev, visibly rattled by the criticism, indicated they 
would be leaving the Politburo after the congress. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev disclosed earlier that three other members of the ruling body had 
asked for retirement, and others are expected to withdraw or be removed at the 
end of the 10-day congress that will seat a new leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates have indicated they will return Gorbachev to the role of party 
leader, likely with a deputy to take some of the political workload off his 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
Leningrad party leader Boris V. Gidaspov told reporters that two party members 
considered front-runners either to challenge Gorbachev as general secretary or 
to serve as his deputy are Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin and Ivashko, the 
Ukrainian leader. 
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian Parliament, meanwhile, has called home 60 of its delegates to the 
congress to hold a session on republic issues, another sign of assertiveness by 
one of the nation's more than 100 ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
During his appearance before the congress, Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov 
said the secessionist movement in Lithuania would have to abide by Soviet law, 
which includes holding a public referendum and phasing the withdrawal over at 
least five years. 
</P>
<P>
Lithuania's Parliament voted last week to suspend its March 11 declaration of 
independence for 100 days, buying time to work out a solution with Moscow, 
which had invoked an economic embargo on the republic in mid-April.

U.S. WON'T BALK AT MORE JAPAN AID FOR CHINA

<P>
The Bush Administration signaled Saturday that it will not object if Japan 
resumes billions of dollars worth of lending to China, even though Washington 
technically still favors continuing the economic sanctions that the allies 
imposed on Beijing in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The modified U.S. position, disclosed by President Bush in a meeting with 
Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, was designed to give Japan the green 
light that it has been seeking to resume some lending to China while still 
keeping the allied sanctions intact. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo initially had hoped to persuade leaders at the annual seven-nation 
economic summit beginning here Monday to relax the allied restrictions, which 
were put into force at last year's summit parley after Beijing's crackdown on 
dissidents at Tian An Men Square in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But U.S. officials said the White House was fearful of angering Congress, which 
still has not approved the Administration's proposal to renew 
most-favored-nation trade benefits that the United States has been granting 
Beijing since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's seeming willingness to look the other way while Japan resumes lending to 
China appeared to pave the way for the summit to give its collective blessing 
to such a compromise during deliberations Monday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Strapped by the drying up of foreign capital, Beijing has been pressing Japan 
and other rich industrialized countries to resume their earlier lending so it 
can spur its economy out of a slump. Tokyo is especially sensitive to such 
pressure because it is seeking to maintain good political relations with its 
Chinese neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Some officials have suggested that the allies may use a similar formula to work 
around their differences over aid to the Soviet Union, which West Germany and 
France want to step up, but which Washington opposes. Under a China-like 
compromise, the leaders could approve a "common framework" that would allow 
individual countries broad leeway to do as they wish on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady hinted Saturday at such an approach. "We 
understand nations have different interests, different points of view," Brady 
told reporters in a discussion of the Soviet and China aid issues. "There isn't 
necessarily one overarching principle that governs how different nations should 
conduct themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Bush and Kaifu, the summit participants include West German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, French President 
Francois Mitterrand, Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti and Canadian Prime 
Minister Brian Mulroney. 
</P>
<P>
Jacques Delors, president of the Europe Commission, the European Community's 
executive branch, also is attending the parley. 
</P>
<P>
The softened attitude signaled Saturday on the part of the United States 
appeared to be partly a response to Japan's recent concessions in broad 
U.S.-Japanese economic talks that the two sides recently completed in Tokyo. 
Bush praised Kaifu profusely Saturday for his "outstanding leadership" in that 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, the President reiterated in no uncertain terms the 
Administration's opposition to providing massive Western aid to the Soviet 
Union, as proposed by France and West Germany, repeating earlier assertions 
that the money would only be wasted unless Moscow first makes needed economic 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear what impact Bush's stand Saturday would have on 
Congress' consideration of the proposal to continue previous U.S. trade 
preferences for China. Many lawmakers already are angry over Bush's reluctance 
to take a harder line toward Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have assailed the Administration for maintaining a "double standard" 
for economic aid to China and the Soviet Union, taking a hard line on loans and 
trade benefits for Moscow while continuing them relatively freely for Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Bush told reporters during a brief break in the proceedings Saturday that 
Washington still believes that the allies should maintain the multilateral 
sanctions that they imposed on Beijing last year, which include a partial 
freeze on World Bank lending. 
</P>
<P>
But he said Japan is a sovereign nation that "can make up its own mind on a lot 
of questions," including the one of whether to resume bilateral aid to Beijing. 
"They work very cooperatively with the U.S.," he said of the Japanese, "but 
sometimes they have interests (of their own) that prevail." 
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that while Bush and 
other U.S. officials "do have concerns about multilateral lending to China . . 
. there are other kinds of activities, other kinds of lending that might be 
undertaken by individual countries, and we're willing to hear what their 
arguments are." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japan left no doubt that it plans to resume lending to China almost 
as soon as it can find an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
Taizo Watanabe, Kaifu's spokesman, told journalists Saturday that Tokyo already 
had been encouraged by Beijing's recent lifting of martial law in Beijing and 
Lhasa, Tibet, and allowing Fang Lizhi to leave China for exile in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"When there is further improvement, we could be inclined to proceed" with 
resumption of a multimillion-dollar regional development loan to China, 
Watanabe said. 
</P>
<P>
Watanabe also reaffirmed that Japan shares the U.S. view that the allies should 
not begin massive international lending programs for the Soviet Union, at least 
until Moscow makes needed economic reforms, such as providing for private 
property and private ownership of corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo is particularly incensed because Moscow still has not shown any 
willingness to open talks on returning four islands in the southern Kuriles off 
Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido that were seized by the Soviets in 
1945 at the end of World War II. The Northern Territories, as they are called 
by Japanese, have been occupied by the Soviets since then, but Tokyo regards 
them as Japanese territory. 
</P>
<P>
On the China issue, Tokyo already has begun moving toward a break from the 
allied position. Earlier this month, Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking Corp. 
announced that it had signed a contract to lend China's state-owned airline 
$126 million to buy a new Boeing 747-400 aircraft -- a move that analysts said 
showed that Japan's Finance Ministry already had lifted its ban on China loans 
by Japanese banks. 
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, bowing to allied demands, has limited its lending to China to 
so-called "human needs" loans for earthquake relief and the like. However, 
apparently with U.S. blessing, the kinds of loans counted in this category have 
expanded steadily over the months. In May, the bank approved a $150-million 
loan to China to improve farm output.

<P>
From all appearances, the shallow waters of the toddler wading pool posed 
little danger to Tina Cocco, a boisterous 3-year-old. Seated securely inside a 
brightly colored, puppy dog-shaped float toy she called "Snoopy," the 
dark-haired child happily splashed around the pool under the watchful eyes of 
her mother and a baby-sitter. 
</P>
<P>
But in a matter of seconds, as the women lounged in the sun at the Nellie Gail 
Ranch Swim Club in Laguna Hills, came near-disaster. Without warning, the 
plastic inflatable raft overturned, trapping Tina's head and upper body 
underwater as her legs kicked the air, entangling themselves in the leg holes 
of the suddenly menacing toy. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Cocco moved quickly and pulled her frightened, yet safe, daughter from the 
water. Although the incident was but a momentary scare, experts say it points 
to the dangers of children being left unsupervised in pools with inflatable 
toys not designed to act as life preservers. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission said 1,954 people, 
including an estimated 600 children under the age of 14, were injured in 
accidents involving flotation toys used in pools. Of those, about 100 were 
hospitalized. And although the federal agency does not track deaths associated 
with the toys, physicians say that some patients hospitalized in these cases 
often suffer permanent brain damage, or die. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, where a high percentage of backyard pools help make 
drowning the No. 1 cause of death at home for young children, many communities 
have banned flotation devices from public pools. 
</P>
<P>
But lifeguards and other experts say that in many cases, the word simply hasn't 
gotten out to parents that the flotation toys so popular with children can be 
hazardous if used as a substitute for life preservers. 
</P>
<P>
"They are very dangerous," said Sally Schneider, aquatics coordinator for the 
American Red Cross in Long Beach. "Floating toys are the last thing you should 
put your child in to play in the water." 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the flotation devices charge that the colorful, often animal-shaped 
toys can easily deflate while in the water and have an alarming tendency to tip 
over. Toy manufacturers point out that their products are toys, not life 
jackets, and note that all such inflatable toys carrying warning labels on 
their packaging boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, critics worry that too many parents fail to read the warning labels in 
their rush to enjoy their backyard pools; they assume that because the toys 
float and often are designed to fit a small child's body, they can be used as 
life preservers. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, water-safety officials say that all too often the child 
who uses the toys cannot swim. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the real danger," said Milton Freeman, national YMCA aquatics director 
based in Atlanta. "These toys give a sense of false security. Parents have a 
tendency to strap them in and leave for a minute, and that's all it takes." 
</P>
<P>
Toy makers insist they have gone to great lengths to warn parents that the 
items are toys, not constructed to keep a child afloat, and are no substitute 
for adult supervision. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine telling anyone that these toys are in any way baby-sitters," 
said Dave Fisher, director of product design at Intex Recreation Corp., a Long 
Beach-based company with manufacturing plants in Taiwan and Singapore. "I don't 
understand how people can go off to answer the phone and leave their kids in 
the pool." 
</P>
<P>
Intex is acknowledged by competitors as one of the leading flotation toy 
manufacturers on the West Coast. Fisher said sales of the firm's line of 
inflatable water toys reached $100 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
"Safety is something we think about every day," he said. "We've never tipped 
one over in all the hundreds of times we've tested these toys. But there are 
some people who are going to misuse a product no matter how it's made." 
</P>
<P>
The potential danger has been addressed by the Philadelphia-based American 
Society for Testing and Materials, a nonprofit group that provides product 
information. The organization has issued standards for flotation toys and 
recommends warning labels on packaging. Most firms comply with the voluntary 
standards, but experts worry that the general public may not be aware of the 
potential problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been waiting to talk" about the issue for years, said Cathy Ferguson 
Brennan, a former Olympic swim champion who now supervises the swimming program 
at the Nellie Gail Ranch pool. 
</P>
<P>
Brennan, who also helps produce water-safety videos for the American Red Cross, 
said she has been warning of the dangers of the toys "but nobody wants to 
listen. I have spent my lifetime around kids and I have seen the attractive 
nuisance these toys represent." 
</P>
<P>
About 30 feet from the wading pool where Tina Cocco tipped over, Brennan 
re-created the accident with the same model of inflatable toy used by the 
3-year-old to illustrate how easily it could happen. 
</P>
<P>
Placing Charlotte Martin, a 2-year-old of similar size to Tina, into a 
bright-green floating toy shaped like a frog, Brennan stood waist-deep in a 
pool next to the toy and asked the child to climb out. 
</P>
<P>
Grunting determinedly, the slim, blonde girl leaned forward and managed to pull 
most of her body out of the bobbing, plastic toy before it capsized. 
</P>
<P>
With most of her body underwater, Charlotte tried to free herself but her legs 
became tangled in the leg holes, momentarily trapping the youngster before 
Brennan pulled her out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
"A non-swimmer would have panicked and made it difficult to pull her out," 
Brennan said. "Left alone, the child would intake water and drowning would come 
quickly and silently. Underwater, nobody can hear them yelling or screaming." 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration, she said, showed that parents "should beware of flotation 
devices. The pool should be a fun place for a child, but only under close 
supervision." 
</P>
<P>
Brennan and other water-safety experts worry because of the rash of drownings, 
and near-drownings, involving children during the summer months. 
</P>
<P>
In California alone, a UC Davis study released in March shows that children 
under the age of 4 make up about 75% of the pool drownings statewide. Although 
statistics do not indicate how many deaths are linked to the toys, national 
drowning experts say accidents involving inflatables may be grossly 
underreported. 
</P>
<P>
Emergency response crews are too busy to notice anything besides the job at 
hand and parents "are in such a state of trauma, exactly how it happened is not 
of great concern to them," said Dollie Brill, president of the National 
Drowning Prevention Network in Ft. Worth, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no government agency that deals with it, and reporting of this kind 
of accident is extremely limited," Brill said. "It's a hidden problem that 
critically needs some attention." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County, which does not separate pool deaths from others, reported 
120 drownings in 1989. Billie Weiss, a county epidemiologist, estimates that 
80% of all water deaths in the county occur in a private pool. 
</P>
<P>
"Drowning in a pool is the No. 1 cause of death to children under 5 in Los 
Angeles County," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, which averages 12 to 14 water deaths each year for all ages, 
five children under the age of 5 have drowned in local pools or hot tubs this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Ralph Rucker, director of the pediatric pulmonary section of Children's 
Hospital of Orange County, said he also is concerned about the relationship 
between drownings and flotation devices. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm extremely frustrated because when parents put toys in the pool for their 
2-year-old, they make the pool a fun, loving place to be," he said. "But the 
danger to children there is so severe, you've got to look at it like a knife or 
a whirling fan. Pools are a lethal luxury in the back yard." 
</P>
<P>
He added that many flotation devices are not designed for very young children. 
</P>
<P>
"What they don't take into account is that a young child's head is very heavy 
in proportion to the rest of its body," he said. "If you put small children in 
one of those things, it is likely to tip over." 
</P>
<P>
Lee Baxter, western regional director for the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission in San Francisco, said flotation toys "are definitely not a good 
idea for a young child who can't swim. The only device I'd be comfortable with 
is one certified by the U.S. Coast Guard." 
</P>
<P>
The agency's official policy on water toys is that consumers should use them 
"with extreme care and caution," said Rosario Quintanilla, public affairs 
officer for the Consumer Product Safety Commission's Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
After the Cocco family's experience, Tina's nanny, who declined to be 
identified, said the youngster's "Snoopy" water toy was "cut into little pieces 
and thrown away." 
</P>
<P>
In recalling the incident, Jill Cocco said she was lucky that she had been 
watching her daughter as she played in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
"At night, I can still see it happen," she said. "I can close my eyes and still 
see it unfold in front of me. Fortunately, I was only three feet away and saved 
(Tina) before she became a victim. I feel so lucky. I also feel a need to warn 
other parents."

FEINSTEIN AND WILSON SIDESTEP BUDGET CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Both are running campaigns touting their courageous leadership, and both have 
boasted of their prowess in managing governments. But Pete Wilson and Dianne 
Feinstein have sidestepped the looming state budget crisis like quarterbacks 
with bad knees dodging onrushing linemen. 
</P>
<P>
As the Legislature and governor suffer paroxysms over the politically difficult 
topic of raising taxes and cutting government services, the gubernatorial 
candidates have discussed their druthers only grudgingly, and in cautious 
generalities. 
</P>
<P>
Each is not quite sure that raising taxes is the way to go. Each is insistent 
that cutbacks be made. And each has stubbornly refused to delineate what 
cutbacks they would favor, if they were in charge -- which, of course, they 
wish to be. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to govern, you ought to tell people how you're going to 
govern," said Assembly Ways and Means Chairman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa 
Clara), who has tried to no avail to interest the candidates in the budget 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
"I've heard nothing specific from either." 
</P>
<P>
Republican Wilson, in an interview last week, repeatedly refused to say where 
he would cut back state services -- or increase taxes -- to accommodate the 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first place, I am not in charge," he said in response to persistent 
questioning. "We have a governor who is in charge and what he needs is not 
advice -- he needs votes." 
</P>
<P>
The senator backed away from a call by Republican Sen. Ken Maddy, a Wilson 
supporter, for a $729-million tax increase that would form the basis of a 
budget-balancing agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very, very skeptical," Wilson said. "I'd like to see the spending cuts." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson dodged a query about whether he was suggesting that it was possible to 
resolve the $3.6-billion deficit by cuts alone -- without tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that you will see, I hope next week, a resolution of that," he said, 
adding, "I hope that they will be successful. They're running out of time." 
</P>
<P>
Like Wilson, Feinstein has focused little public attention on the troublesome 
issue of tax increases and cutbacks. Her involvement in the budget deficit 
crisis has been limited to a quick visit to Sacramento on June 14, during which 
she visited in private with Democratic lawmakers and emerged to say she was 
prepared to act as an informal adviser. 
</P>
<P>
She said then that she was "not entirely" supportive of a package then making 
the rounds that would have increased taxes by $2.3 billion and staved off the 
rest of the deficit in budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
"My general thrust is you've got to cut wherever you can, and I think you then 
have to reassess the situation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about specific targets, Feinstein said, "I'll say more on that later." 
</P>
<P>
But her spokeswoman, Dee Dee Myers, now says it is "unlikely" that Feinstein 
will endorse any specific moves. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a moot issue," she said, referring to the fact that the state 
crisis must be solved before the November election. "That's what we elect these 
people to do." 
</P>
<P>
Myers said Feinstein could not be specific because as a candidate she was 
operating in a "universe of limited information." 
</P>
<P>
"She's not privy to all of the insider information," Myers said. "We don't have 
the resources of the Assembly Office of Research and the budget office. 
Preparing a state budget is a broad and complex task." 
</P>
<P>
But Vasconcellos said each of the candidates has been offered all the budget 
information available. "That's an excuse, not a response," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The only candidate to offer a budget plan this political season was Atty. Gen. 
John K. Van de Kamp, and his resounding loss to Feinstein in the Democratic 
primary may offer a clue to why neither of the remaining two candidates has 
stepped forward with specific solutions. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the result in my race, perhaps that's the best politics," he said wryly. 
</P>
<P>
But Van de Kamp drew a distinction between the kind of negative political 
fallout that greeted Walter Mondale's 1984 statement that taxes might have to 
be raised and the impact a specific statement on state budgetary matters would 
have on Wilson and Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I got hurt on the issue," he said. "I don't think this would 
hurt either one of them very much." 
</P>
<P>
"It would be valuable to have both candidates say something about it and give 
us an idea how they would behave," he added. "It's just too easy to say it's 
none of our business and we don't have control." 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp, who proclaimed without much hyperbole that he had been more 
specific about budgetary matters than any gubernatorial candidate in memory, 
proposed boosting the state's top tax rates from 9.3% to 11% for those making 
more than $100,000 a year. All together, he detailed almost $2.3 billion in new 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney general also suggested more than $1.3 billion in budget cutbacks, 
chiefly by making a 5% cut in state administrative costs and restoring the 
$1.3-billion budget reserve over two years rather than one year. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Van de Kamp's plan was criticized as unworkable by some legislators 
skeptical of its chance of passage, and the attorney general himself 
acknowledges that neither Wilson nor Feinstein can directly affect the state 
budget choices this year. 
</P>
<P>
While dancing around budget specifics, both remaining candidates are trying to 
gauge the impact of the sharpening state and national debate over how to cut 
budget deficits, a discussion which is increasingly bipartisan. In addition to 
Republican Maddy's call for increased state taxes, President Bush recently was 
forced to abandon his campaign promise that he would not raise taxes and concur 
that some increases are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson insists that the matter will not hurt him, despite the fact that he 
could be in the position of voting on federal tax increases at the same time 
that he is labeling Feinstein a "tax-and-spend Democrat." 
</P>
<P>
Voters, he said, "don't have any trouble" equating Democrats with taxation. 
</P>
<P>
But at the same time, Wilson drew a distinction between increased income taxes 
-- which he said he does not support -- and increases in fees. The semantic 
difference has traditionally been one emphasized by politicians faced with dire 
fiscal realities. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's spokeswoman Myers reflected general Democratic thought that the 
break in Republican ranks over taxes will take the issue away from GOP 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
"It muddies up the issue," she said. "There's a sense with the Bush thing in 
particular that while the Republicans run around promising not to raise taxes, 
when push comes to shove they're probably going to raise taxes anyway."

DOES PETE WILSON HAVE A HEART? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I can tell that Pete Wilson does have a heart ("RoboPol," by Ronald Brownstein, 
May 13). I doubt I'd vote for him, because any Democrat is bound to address my 
concerns -- education, medical care for the needy, controlled growth, et cetera 
-- better than any Republican. Still, I admire him for the seemingly 
incorruptible stubborn conscience he votes with.

Honest introspection is the hallmark of a healthy psychology, and I am 
dumbfounded to learn that Wilson would admit to trying it once but not liking 
it. Do we want a computer or a person sitting in the highest office in our 
state? Scary stuff, that article.

HARRY SHEARER

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harry Shearer's "High Desert Drifters" (Man Bites Town, April 8) is another 
example of why he occupies the way cool end of a spectrum that includes the 
late Andy Kaufman (the other end) and Garrison Keillor (center). 
</P>
<P>
The best satirists can undermine our vanity by slipping in references to forces 
in our lives that we mistakenly thought we had dismissed, outgrown, transcended 
or rejected. But even for someone gifted with impeccable social timing, this is 
an heroic task in an age when nobody gets to see the wizard, not nobody, not no 
how. I respectfully submit, however, that Shearer wears the ruby slippers. And 
that, ladies and gentlemen, is a chakra of a different color.

AUTUMN OF A DICTATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I visited Chile two weeks after Dorfman. I saw a business district swarming 
with hard-working people bustling among small shops. Everything seemed in ample 
supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
I visited the poorer areas of the town and saw clean streets, a proud people 
and decent houses surrounding tiny shops. 
</P>
<P>
And yes, at 2 a.m. I saw the carabineros roughing up a young man while taking 
him to their armored car. As my Chilean hostess screamed "Asesino!" at the 
Uzi-toting police, my personal belief in freedom quickly wrestled with my need 
to survive. 
</P>
<P>
The Chile I saw is strong enough to wrestle with the past, but the Chilean 
people I met have an irrepressible drive to succeed in the future through their 
own hard work.

Most readers probably believe "The a masterful rewrite of Chilean history. 
Dorfman claims that Gen. Augusto Pinochet was a tyrant, seeking to reign 
forever; "ended democracy there" by ("backed by the U.S.") overthrowing 
Allende; "terrorized" the people and brought "economic crises" to Chile. 
</P>
<P>
But, the worse lie is that Pinochet "hit upon . . . an ingenious idea" to turn 
National Stadium into a concentration camp for torturing and executing 
dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
It was Allende, not Pinochet, who first filled National Stadium with 
"dissidents." One was my wife's brother, severely tortured but released. Not so 
lucky were hundreds with him who Allende killed. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, "all the atrocities must be remembered." Let's remember every communist 
killed by the military in the battle for Chile; let's also remember those 
hundreds, maybe thousands, of anti-communists killed by Allende.

PLANNING TO PROPOSE to your sweetheart but don't know how to do it? A 15-foot 
red heart stationed outside her home is sure to score a yes. And when the big 
day of the nuptials finally arrives, Adams Balloon Advertising can drape a 
banner over a giant inflatable, replete with personal message and internal 
lighting. 
</P>
<P>
In this city of air kisses and overblown egos, there is now a way to send 
appropriately grandiose holiday and personal messages: with a custom inflated 
balloon that lights up with your special salutation. Adams will set up a 
33x30-foot birthday cake inflatable (for $450) on your father's front lawn 
decorated with a personal message (24x20-foot is $350, 11x9-foot is $150). Or, 
depending on your relationship and the intended greeting, maybe a 22-foot-high 
gorilla ($350) -- or a 25-foot-high clown ($350; 18 feet, $250) -- would best 
do the trick. And when Halloween rolls around this fall, there are giant 
jack-o'-lanterns and friendly ghosts, and for Christmas, robust Santas and 
snowmen and such. Joan draper Adams Balloon Advertising, 701 Redlen Ave.,

COUNTY TO ASK OK TO START ON MALIBU SEWER; 
</P>
<P>
SANITATION: OPPONENTS CALL THE PLAN TO PRESSURE COASTAL COMMISSION A 
'DESPERATE' PLOY TO PREVENT A NEW GOVERNMENT FROM BLOCKING THE PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In a bid to speed construction of a controversial sewer system in Malibu, Los 
Angeles County officials have indicated that they will press the California 
Coastal Commission this week to allow the work to begin. 
</P>
<P>
A county public works official said last week that the county will ask that 
construction be allowed to proceed without waiting for the state panel to 
consider other approvals that ordinarily could be expected to take at least 
several more months. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's important for the commission to consider what we have submitted 
to them and allow us to move ahead with the project," said Harry Stone, the 
county's deputy director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
The Coastal Commission is to consider the matter Tuesday when it meets in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the sewer plan immediately labeled the county's latest move as a 
last-ditch effort to get construction under way before a new Malibu government 
has the chance to block it. 
</P>
<P>
"It shows how desperate the county is, that they're trying to circumvent the 
normal hearing process," said Bob Briskin, whose home in the Malibu Country 
Estates subdivision is near where the county wants to build a sewage plant. 
</P>
<P>
The Malibu Country Estates Homeowners Assn. last week filed a lawsuit against 
the county in an attempt to block the plant from being built there, contending 
that the environmental impact of the plant has not been adequately studied. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the subdivision, next to Pepperdine University, have expressed 
concern that if the sewer plant is built under their noses, it could damage the 
property values of their million-dollar homes. 
</P>
<P>
All five members of Malibu's future City Council, chosen last month at the same 
time voters overwhelmingly approved cityhood, are on record as being opposed to 
the sewer plan. They say it is too large and too costly and would open the door 
to more development than the area can realistically absorb. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the victory for cityhood forces, however, the county has gone to court 
to delay the actual incorporation. A three-judge panel in Los Angeles has set a 
July 18 hearing to decide whether incorporation is allowed to go forward or 
whether the county can succeed in delaying it until next March. 
</P>
<P>
Last November, the Coastal Commission approved a sewer plan that calls for a 
system 25% to 40% smaller than what the county had insisted upon. 
</P>
<P>
However, the actual construction must also be approved by the coastal panel 
before the work can begin. County officials had predicted as recently as three 
months ago that it might be April, 1991, before approvals are obtained and next 
June before the first pipe is laid. 
</P>
<P>
The county Board of Supervisors in April obeyed a judge's order to quit 
stalling and set a date for the incorporation election. In authorizing the 
election, however, the supervisors imposed a delay of incorporation that, while 
being challenged in the courts, has left Malibu's newly elected officials 
without a city to govern. 
</P>
<P>
In approving a bid by Malibu residents to vote on cityhood last year, the Local 
Agency Formation Commission stipulated that the county be allowed to retain 
control over the sewer system for up to 10 years after incorporation. But some 
LAFCO members expressed doubts about the legality of the provision, and several 
of the future council members have made it clear that they favor challenging it 
once the city is incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
At issue before the Coastal Commission is whether the county should be allowed 
to proceed with construction based on the plans it has submitted for the sewer 
system. 
</P>
<P>
By law, the proposed sewer system must comply with both a 1986 land-use plan 
for the Malibu coastal zone and a so-called implementation plan for setting up 
zoning ordinances and other legal mechanisms for carrying out the land-use 
plan.

TIE BEACH HOTEL TO BALLOT ISSUE, DEVELOPER ASKS; 
</P>
<P>
SANTA MONICA: SAVE OUR BEACHES OPPOSES THE HOTEL AND COMMUNITY CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Restaurateur Michael McCarty, faced with mounting opposition to his proposed 
luxury beachfront hotel and community center, has decided to ask the Santa 
Monica City Council to place the fate of the project in the hands of the voters 
this November. 
</P>
<P>
McCarty said he is willing to leave the project up to a public vote in order to 
end debate with a group of opponents that he characterized as small but vocal, 
and in an effort to avoid legal challenges that might tie up his plans for 
years. Rather than a separate ballot measure, he said the council could tie the 
fate of the project to one of the two beachfront development initiatives 
already scheduled for the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll have no argument after the people have supported this -- none," 
McCarty said of his opponents. "I want this party over." 
</P>
<P>
Announcing his decision on Thursday in a private upstairs room of Michael's, 
his gourmet Santa Monica restaurant, McCarty said he was confident of success. 
"I have nothing to fear or hide." 
</P>
<P>
The shift in strategy is in response to increasing criticism of McCarty's plan 
from a group of residents who early this year brought about the defeat of a 
large commercial project on city-owned land at Santa Monica Municipal Airport 
by tapping strong anti-development sentiment in the city. 
</P>
<P>
A leader of the group Save Our Beaches, Sharon Gilpin, has threatened to 
organize a referendum campaign if McCarty's project wins city approval. Gilpin 
said Thursday that she did not share McCarty's belief that the public would 
favor a luxury hotel on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
By going directly to the public, McCarty is taking a calculated risk that he 
may lose a project into which he has invested millions. At his press 
conference, McCarty reluctantly agreed that if "the people of Santa Monica 
don't want this project, we probably won't build this project." 
</P>
<P>
As it stands now, his 160-room hotel is on the council agenda for final 
approval later this month. City officials have embraced the project so far, in 
part because it would generate an estimated $1 million a year for the city, and 
also because of the community center McCarty plans to build on part of the 
property. The center would include public changing rooms and showers, a 
children's park, an arts and environment center and a 200-seat cafe. 
</P>
<P>
The site of the project, at 415 Pacific Coast Highway, has been leased to a 
membership-only club, the Sand and Sea Club, since the early 1960s, at a rent 
of $250,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been under pressure for years from the state to use the publicly 
owned land for public beach access. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the plan, including Sand and Sea Club members, question whether 
$300-a-night luxury hotel rooms are an appropriate use of public land. 
</P>
<P>
Gilpin's group is seeking public access to the entire parcel, rather than just 
the community center, and accuses city officials of underestimating community 
opposition to commercial development. "I think in this city we're finding the 
leadership is not in step with the public on development issues." 
</P>
<P>
McCarty said he would ask the council to tie his project to two competing beach 
development initiatives on the November ballot. By doing so, he would relieve 
the council of a potentially unpopular pro-development vote in an election 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Gilpin said her group has been lobbying council members over the past few 
weeks, asking them to give voters a chance to approve or reject the beach 
hotel, rather than deciding the "hot potato" themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Her group's initiative, Save Our Beaches, seeks to ban all commercial 
development on the beach. The competing initiative on the ballot -- sponsored 
by a group called Santa Monicans for a Livable Environment and known by the 
acronym SMiLE -- also opposes commercial development on the beach, but exempts 
McCarty's project because it is already in the pipeline. Under McCarty's 
proposal, passage of that initiative then could lead to construction of the 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
If the City Council were to keep to its schedule and approve the hotel this 
month, then the proposal would not be subject to either initiative, and the 
only recourse of the anti-hotel forces would be another referendum next year. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica City Manager John Jalili said he is unaware of any obstacle to 
McCarty's suggestion that the project's approval be tied to the initiatives, if 
it meets with council approval.

REGIONAL ANTI-DRUG POLICE TEAM WILL SPREAD A WIDER NET; 
</P>
<P>
LAW ENFORCEMENT: SIGNAL HILL, SANTA MONICA AND UCLA POLICE, SHERIFF'S 
DEPARTMENT TO JOIN WESTNET. 
</P>

<P>
WESTNET's first arrest nabbed more than $500,000 in cash and 30 kilos of 
cocaine just as the suspected dealers tried to move to a new location by 
concealing the cocaine in packages wrapped like birthday gifts. 
</P>
<P>
Since that raid nearly 18 months ago, the Westside Narcotics Enforcement Team 
has seized more than $3.5 million in cash, well over a ton of cocaine and other 
drugs, and scores of vehicles and weapons, while arresting 57 suspected drug 
traffickers. Ninety-five percent of the arrests have led to convictions, 
according to the team's leader, Capt. Tim Grimmond of the El Segundo Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
The successes of the team -- initially created by the Inglewood, El Segundo, 
Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach and Palos Verdes Estates police, with Redondo 
Beach and Hawthorne quickly joining in -- have attracted the attention of 
several other police departments. 
</P>
<P>
This month, WESTNET will expand out of the South Bay as four new police 
agencies come on board -- the Santa Monica Police Department, UCLA's police 
force, the county Sheriff's Department and the Signal Hill Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
With the expansion to 11 agencies, WESTNET's original team of nine officers 
will be joined by a second team of nine, doubling its investigative capacity. 
</P>
<P>
The operation's growth warrants giving it headquarters of its own, El Segundo 
city officials have decided. The city is putting up $100,000 to turn the 
basement of City Hall into a new home for WESTNET. 
</P>
<P>
Each police department assigns officers to WESTNET when it joins the team. The 
agencies also provide equipment, such as cars, radios and computers. 
</P>
<P>
Although Grimmond said he knew WESTNET would do well when it started in 
January, 1989, its rapid growth has pleased police agencies throughout the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a small community in Los Angeles, and we realize that criminals just 
cross jurisdictional borders without even thinking about it," said Sgt. John 
Miehle, assistant to the Santa Monica Police Department's chief. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't just close ourselves into our borders and think that criminals live 
here and commit their crimes here and nothing else," he said. "That's why we're 
joining WESTNET. We're more than happy to pool our information and our 
resources, because we know that always works out better." 
</P>
<P>
Before the team's creation, Grimmond said: "South Bay police handled narcotics 
on a very local level, with very little surveillance and very little effort put 
into regional problems. We worked hand-to-hand sales and saw maybe two to three 
kilos in a big bust." 
</P>
<P>
In 1987 and 1988, however, local narcotics officers began noticing a 
proliferation of cocaine in the South Bay, at roughly the same time crack was 
coming on the scene, Grimmond said. 
</P>
<P>
Although larger police departments had the resources to create special drug 
enforcement teams, smaller South Bay departments did not have that option. 
</P>
<P>
WESTNET grew out of their frustration, Grimmond said. 
</P>
<P>
Drug dealers "operate all over. They know no boundaries," he said. "They move 
as fast and as far as cars and planes will take them. That's how we have to 
move." 
</P>
<P>
Although the team's cases all begin with information gathered in the South Bay, 
Grimmond said, most leads eventually take them out of this area. 
</P>
<P>
Their biggest haul to date -- 491 kilos of cocaine hidden behind a false 
partition in a 20-foot tractor-trailer rig -- was taken at a truck stop just 
outside Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
On some cases, Grimmond said, individual officers have spent weeks on 
surveillance before making an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Police officials, however, say they are not concerned about the amount of time 
the team spends outside its home area. 
</P>
<P>
"By pooling your resources, you can start to solve the problem. There are no 
walls around this place," said Chief John Barber of the UCLA police agency. 
"One of the real benefits for us, too, is that an officer working on a 
specialized task force is working with some of the best experts in the world. . 
. . We get back a better officer." 
</P>
<P>
Officers assigned to WESTNET will rotate out every two or three years, Barber 
said. Not least among the benefits, police chiefs say, is that federal drug 
asset seizure laws allow local agencies to keep a large portion of the cash, 
cars and other assets that have been used in drug transactions. 
</P>
<P>
This means that at least $250,000 has gone to each WESTNET member agency so 
far, more than covering the operation's cost. 
</P>
<P>
"Our primary objective is to arrest these people and prosecute them," Grimmond 
said. "But it's been a big boon to law enforcement to have something like this 
pay for itself, too."

FIRMS JOIN TO BUILD HOTEL IN MALIBU; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: THE ADAMSON COS. AND A JAPANESE FIRM FORM A PARTNERSHIP ON THE 
PROPOSED 300-ROOM, $65-MILLION HOTEL. THE PROJECT FACES OPPOSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Adamson Cos. has announced it will join forces with the firm that owns the 
Hotel Bel-Air to develop and manage a luxury hotel the company has long wanted 
to build overlooking the Pacific Ocean in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
A company official hailed the agreement with the Sazale Corp., announced last 
week, as a "giant step toward ensuring that ours becomes a world-class hotel in 
Malibu." 
</P>
<P>
"We're extremely pleased to have them as partners," said Jay Hanan, director of 
real estate for the Adamson Cos., one of Malibu's largest landowners. Besides 
the Hotel Bel-Air, which it purchased recently, Sazale, a Japanese firm, 
operates several other luxury hotels in the United States and France, including 
the Biltmore in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Hanan declined to disclose what stake each partner will have, saying details 
have yet to be worked out. But he said it was "very possible" that Sazale may 
become the majority partner. 
</P>
<P>
"They're obviously going to manage the hotel. We're not in the hotel business," 
he said. "We're providing the land and some capital, and they will be providing 
the management and some capital." 
</P>
<P>
Although Adamson officials have said they hope to start soon on construction of 
the proposed 300-room, $65-million hotel on 27 acres near Pepperdine 
University, the project faces some potentially formidable obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
In approving the hotel plan four years ago, the California Coastal Commission 
stipulated that a regional sewer system that Los Angeles County wants to build 
in Malibu must be in place before the hotel can open. 
</P>
<P>
But with slow-growth advocates opposed to the sewer and the hotel, and the 
community set to become a city as soon as a court allows incorporation to go 
forward, the project faces an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
Like the county with its sewer system, the Adamson Cos. -- which has already 
spent more than $5 million on the project -- had hoped to start work on the 
hotel before a new Malibu city government has the chance to block it. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the company will ask the state coastal panel to approve an 
interim on-site waste disposal plan for the hotel in the event that the 
county's proposed $43-million sewer system is delayed further. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, final grading plans for the 27-acre site on a hillside above 
Pacific Coast Highway at Malibu Canyon Road must be approved by the coastal 
commission before construction can start. The commission, however, is not 
expected to consider the grading matter for at least another month. 
</P>
<P>
The Adamson Cos. has won few friends among cityhood supporters, who accused it 
of working behind the scenes to defeat a cityhood effort in 1976. Pro-cityhood 
activists were angered last December when the company joined the county in a 
lawsuit intended to further delay a vote on cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
Some cityhood supporters were amazed when several weeks before voters 
overwhelmingly approved cityhood June 5, Sylvia R.A. Neville, Adamson Cos.' 
managing general partner, gave a rare interview to a Malibu newspaper in which 
she declared her support for cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the sewer's opponents were upset when Neville and her sister, 
Rhoda-May Dallas, the firm's other general partner, struck a private deal with 
the county to surrender six acres near Pepperdine as the site of a sewage 
treatment plant. In exchange, the county agreed to do its part to help speed 
construction of the hotel by processing a variety of permits in a timely 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Through a spokesman, Neville said last week that she was "thrilled" to have 
Sazale as a partner in the hotel venture. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sazale Corp. is sensitive to the unique and natural beauty of the Malibu 
area and is looking forward to working with community leaders to ensure that 
the needs of the community, as well as those of the hotel guests, are met," 
Neville said. 
</P>
<P>
Hanan, meanwhile, acknowledged that the company has sent letters to each of 
Malibu's future City Council members, asking to meet with them and discuss the 
hotel plans. 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the hotel would include 15 low-lying Spanish-style villas nestled 
into the hillside, surrounded by extensive landscaping, including streams and 
fountains. There would be a free-standing restaurant at the corner of Pacific 
Coast Highway and Malibu Canyon Road, in addition to restaurants in the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the community will welcome the hotel once they see what is planned," 
said Hanan, who began working on the project about 18 months ago, after Neville 
and Dallas scrapped an earlier design. 
</P>
<P>
Company officials say the villa design will be much less noticeable from the 
busy coastal highway, and its Spanish-style architecture will complement that 
at the university nearby.

PLAYA VISTA DEVELOPERS PLAN PUBLIC WORKSHOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a continuing effort to reach out to the community and eliminate any 
potential roadblocks, the developer of the multibillion-dollar Playa Vista 
project will hold a series of public workshops this week to discuss the impact 
of the planned city-within-a-city. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the evening meetings, to be held Monday, will focus on 
transportation issues associated with the huge development envisioned for the 
area between Marina del Rey and Westchester Bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
The session will examine the traffic, air quality and noise impacts of the vast 
office, residential, retail, marina and hotel complex -- one of the largest 
developments in Los Angeles history. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Maguire Thomas Partners, developers of Playa Vista, will 
discuss the importance of achieving a balance between the number of jobs and 
housing units to reduce commuting and minimize air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's session will deal with Maguire Thomas' specific plans for development 
for the property, including land use and aesthetic issues, public services, 
grading and geological questions. 
</P>
<P>
The session on Wednesday evening will deal with natural, biological and 
cultural issues, including restoration of the Ballona Wetlands, archeology, 
water quality, energy and public works. 
</P>
<P>
All of the sessions will be held at the Airport Marina Hotel, 86O1 Lincoln 
Blvd., Westchester, beginning at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Senior partner Nelson C. Rising said in an interview last week that the 
workshops are intended to offer the public an opportunity to address issues of 
concern early in the planning process. The meetings are the latest in a series 
of public sessions that began after Maguire Thomas took over the 887-acre 
project last year. 
</P>
<P>
An environmental impact report is now being prepared on Maguire Thomas' plans 
for the property. Although the evening meetings are separate from that effort, 
Rising said Maguire Thomas wants to get the public's thoughts "now rather than 
waiting until the environmental impact report is completed." 
</P>
<P>
Rising has said previously that early identification of the issues will 
expedite Maguire Thomas' efforts to win approval for the development. 
</P>
<P>
Intense opposition from environmentalists and residents of surrounding areas 
frustrated efforts by the Summa Corp. to develop a high-rise community on the 
land, which stretches nearly three miles inland from the Pacific Ocean to the 
San Diego Freeway. The property had been owned by industrialist Howard Hughes 
since the 1940s and was part of his estate. 
</P>
<P>
After taking over, Maguire Thomas abandoned Summa's design. The new plans call 
for a mid-rise community with 5 million square feet of offices, 11,750 
apartment and condominium units, 2,400 hotel rooms, 720,000 square feet of 
retail space and a small-craft marina with 750 boat slips.

PEOPLE: NURSING SCHOOL A MOM-DAUGHTER EFFORT

Patricia Beck, a top nursing student at Santa Monica College, worked well with 
her co-workers and classmates at the hospital where they trained. 
</P>
<P>
Her only problem was with one student, who insisted on calling her "Pattie." It 
wasn't the nickname Beck objected to, but the classmate who was using it: 
Beck's daughter Lori Fitzwilliams. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate kids who call their parents by their first names," said Beck, a West 
Los Angeles resident who decided to return to school after a recent divorce. 
"She would call me 'Pat' and 'Pattie,' and I would just ignore her." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwilliams, who lives in Culver City with her husband and two young children, 
said she wasn't trying to be disrespectful to her mother, but merely to be 
professional. "In a hospital setting I wasn't about to go call her, 'Hey, Mom.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Beck, 45, and Fitzwilliams, 25, spent 2 1/2 years together in the nursing 
program and recently graduated with honors. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the disagreement on what Beck should be called, they say being students 
together strengthened their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
Although they never studied together, Fitzwilliams said they called on each 
other for emotional support throughout the rigorous period of studies and 
hospital work. 
</P>
<P>
"She was the only one who understood what I was going through," she said. "She 
knows my whole history, what's going on with my personal life, so we could 
communicate with saying very little." 
</P>
<P>
Two Westside volunteers were bestowed the highest honor of the Los Angeles YMCA 
when they were cited to the Golden Book of Distinguished Service at a meeting 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Terry R. White, a volunteer at the Westside Family YMCA, and Everett Maguire, a 
volunteer at the Palisades-Malibu YMCA, joined the 241 people similarly honored 
since the association established the award in 1934. 
</P>
<P>
Lessing E. Gold, managing partner for the Century City law firm Gold, Marks, 
Ring &amp; Pepper, has been appointed to the board of directors of the 
Shakespeare Festival of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
This July, the festival, a nonprofit, professional theater company dedicated to 
preserving and illuminating Shakespeare's work, will present "Much Ado About 
Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
For the second year in a row, high school senior Asher Hung has been one of 20 
students nationwide to be named a winner in the Scholastic Magazine art 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Hung, a Westwood resident who attends Buckley School in Sherman Oaks, will have 
his entry displayed in the magazine's gallery exhibit in New York. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA sociology professor Jeffrey Alexander was named the winner of the $25,000 
1990 Gold Shield Faculty Prize for Academic Excellence. 
</P>
<P>
The award recognized Alexander as "a teacher who transforms the mass scale of a 
large state university into the intensive education usually associated with a 
small liberal arts college." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander, a Pacific Palisades resident who is chairman of the Department of 
Sociology, is known for his four-volume work titled "Theoretical Logic in 
Sociology." 
</P>
<P>
The Beverly Hills High School Parent-Teacher-Student Assn. installed Evy 
Rappaport for a second term as president. 
</P>
<P>
Other officers elected for the 1990-91 school year were: Sandra Bayrd, first 
vice president; Rivka Seiden, second vice president; Fran Behrstock, 
corresponding secretary; Robin Benedetti, recording secretary; and Gail 
Lowenstein, treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
The National Women's Political Caucus-L.A. Westside has elected Susan Romeo as 
its chairwoman for the 1990-91 year. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the caucus elected Joanne Parker as its administrative vice 
chairwoman; Deborah Reich Castleman as its vice chairwoman, political action; 
Morgan Lynn, treasurer; Michelle Melone, recorder, and Diane Paris and Mary 
Rapoport, county coordinating committee representatives. SHELDON ITO

We would be fun. We would be creative. But most of all, we would be in charge. 
There were three of them, ages 7 to 9, and we had readily agreed to baby-sit 
one recent afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Using a take-charge tone of voice, we suggested some finger-painting to our 
youthful charges. "Buzz off, dummy, we want to watch MTV," said the 8-year-old. 
We would have to be even more creative. Firmly, we offered a game of kick ball 
out on the lawn. No dice. A sing-along? They laughed and made funny faces. "And 
don't even think of reading books," said the 7-year-old. "Books are dumb." They 
sat on the couch with arms crossed, waiting. Then we told them about a 
stonecutter, Tasaku, in a faraway land who envied a prince, until the Spirit of 
the Mountains granted him his wish of being the sun, a cloud and finally a 
mountain. "Tell us more!" one of them said. We had a better idea. We told them 
to take their parents to the free Family Story Hour at the Loyola Village 
Branch at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, where they could meet Gerald McDermott, the 
author of "The Stone-Cutter: A Japanese Folk Tale" and other fables. The 
library is located at 7114 W. Manchester Ave., Westchester. For information, 
call (213) 670-5436. "I guess books are pretty cool after all," said the 
9-year-old. R.D.

RESIGNATION OF BULGARIA CHIEF IS CELEBRATED

SOFIA, Bulgaria

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 20,000 jubilant Bulgarians staged a rally in central Sofia on 
Saturday to celebrate the resignation of President Petar Mladenov, forced out 
by a series of "people power" protests. 
</P>
<P>
Mladenov, 53, who ousted hard-line Communist leader Todor Zhivkov last 
November, resigned after growing public pressure to quit over charges that he 
called for tanks to crush an anti-government protest last December. 
</P>
<P>
The resignation late Friday was unprecedented in Bulgaria's modern history and 
sparked confusion in a country still struggling to make the transition from 
monolithic Communist state to multi-party democracy. 
</P>
<P>
As the demonstration gathered steam outside government buildings, political 
leaders scrambled to find a replacement for Mladenov amid predictions the next 
head of state would come from outside the ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party, 
once the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 students marched through downtown Sofia to hail Mladenov's 
decision to quit. Earlier, student leaders announced the end of a 27-day sit-in 
protest, saying that their main demand had been met. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mladenov's party won a sweeping victory in free elections last month, 
many Bulgarians are skeptical of its commitment to reform, and many university 
graduates have emigrated. 
</P>
<P>
"The students' strike was not against one person but against a demoralized 
system," poet Blaga Dimitrova told the crowd from the steps of the National 
bank.

MONROVIA, Liberia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Samuel K. Doe's shattered government announced a cease-fire on a 
makeshift radio station but sporadic fighting between Liberian soldiers and 
rebels continued Saturday on the fringe of the besieged capital. 
</P>
<P>
A radio broadcast Friday night said a cease-fire had been reached and it 
appealed to shops to open and government workers to return to their offices. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly everything remained closed, however. 
</P>
<P>
Monrovians have been beset by looting government troops, rebels bent on tribal 
reprisals and severe food shortages, and deprived of running water and 
electricity for more than a week. 
</P>
<P>
Many said they wanted to believe the cease-fire announcement but did not. 
</P>
<P>
There was no comment from the rebels, but they have said previously that Doe 
must leave the country before they will accept a truce. 
</P>
<P>
Led by former government aide Charles Taylor, the rebels invaded from Ivory 
Coast on Dec. 24 to overthrow Doe's government, which they accuse of 
corruption, tribalism and brutal suppression of opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Liberian and diplomatic sources said the cease-fire was announced from a 
makeshift radio station at Doe's fortified beachside executive mansion. The 
radio went off the air after the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
Few people heard the broadcast because the main state radio station on the 
eastern outskirts of Monrovia stopped broadcasting Tuesday as rebels advanced 
on the city. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels have been unable to make good on their claim that they could take 
Monrovia within 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Doe has been deserted by most of his Cabinet ministers, the two chief army 
commanders and dozens of other top officials. Government troops appear 
demoralized and disorganized, and many have abandoned their posts. 
</P>
<P>
Rebels attacked the city's port Friday, and the capital echoed with the rumble 
of heavy artillery and the crackle of gunfire. The fighting Saturday was 
sporadic and occurred on the city's western and eastern outskirts. 
</P>
<P>
Relief workers said about 40 people, civilians and soldiers, were treated for 
injuries at an emergency field hospital set up by the European agency Doctors 
Without Borders at a Roman Catholic hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people, fearing tribal reprisals by soldiers or rebels, have been 
trying to get into overcrowded refugee compounds, some of which are protected 
by Swiss personnel of the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
Refugees said many people jumped a wall Friday night to join them at the 
American Community School. 
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats said about 17,000 people had gathered for safety at the 
compound of the U.S. government's ship-tracking transmitter. The transmitter, 
one of only seven of its kind in the world, fell behind rebel lines on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Managers at the Omega station, just outside Monrovia, have refused rebel 
demands that they hand over Krahns and Mandingos among the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Doe is of the Krahn tribe, and Mandingos are accused of supporting him and 
growing wealthy during his corrupt 10-year administration. 
</P>
<P>
Creeks and wells in the city were crowded with people bathing or collecting 
water for cooking and drinking. Health officials fear outbreaks of cholera and 
other water-borne diseases. 
</P>
<P>
A supermarket, the first to open for days, let in shoppers two or three at a 
time after they had lined up for more than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Embassy spokesman denied a report Friday that the embassy had supplied 
water to Doe's Israeli-built mansion. He said a water tanker escorted by 
Marines had gone Friday to a creek near the mansion to collect water for the 
embassy compound. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has offered to help Doe leave Liberia. He reportedly has 
offered to resign on condition that his safety and that of his minority Krahn 
tribe is guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
After the rebels invaded, Doe's forces killed hundreds of civilian members of 
the Gio and Mano tribes, seen as the main support base for the rebels. The 
rebels then sought revenge by killing members of the Krahn tribe and the 
Mandingo people, who supported Doe. 
</P>
<P>
Rebel leader Taylor is a strong supporter of capitalism and he has widespread 
support in Liberia. But the United States and other governments have questioned 
his commitment to democracy and free elections.

WHAT'S BREWING IN LEBANON? AMERICAN BEER; 
</P>
<P>
MIDEAST: IT'S THE NEWEST ATTRACTION AT A TRUCK STOP IN THE MOUNTAINS NEAR THE 
FAMOUS GROVE OF CEDARS.

THE CEDARS, Lebanon 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When a Shiite Muslim truck driver pulls into the Christian-run truck stop here, 
political differences are set aside over a cold bottle of American beer. 
</P>
<P>
The truck stop, 6,300 feet up in the mountains and near Lebanon's famous grove 
of cedars, has served truckers and tourists for 23 years. The newest attraction 
is a brand of beer out of Pittsburgh called "American." Abu Youssef, who runs 
the place, can't keep enough of it in stock. 
</P>
<P>
The brew comes in a red, white and blue can with a picture of an American 
eagle, its wings extended in flight, clutching a flagstaff flying Old Glory. 
</P>
<P>
The Shiite Muslims of Lebanon are often associated with hostage-taking, so the 
friendly Shiite truck drivers would be amused if they could read the English 
legend under the beer logo: "Quality brewed to capture the spirit and strength 
of America." 
</P>
<P>
Almost every day, between 50 and 75 trucks stop at Abu Youssef's place, which 
is midway between Tripoli on the northern coast and Baalbek in the Bekaa 
Valley, a distance of 76 miles. 
</P>
<P>
The trucks start at sea level and climb to Cedars Pass, elevation 8,690 feet, 
then descend into the valley. There, fruits and vegetables are repacked in 
refrigerated trailer trucks for shipment on to Saudi Arabia and the Persian 
Gulf emirates. 
</P>
<P>
There are about 20 Syrian army and Christian militia checkpoints along the 
route, and they all impose a toll on the truckers. This is paid either in cash 
or in cucumbers or whatever the cargo happens to be. 
</P>
<P>
The coastal plain is hot, the roads are in disrepair and often crowded with 
herds of goats that tend to ignore the trucks' angry horns, and all this makes 
stopping here the high point of the drivers' day. 
</P>
<P>
Almost invariably, the drivers order a dish of hummus, a Lebanese dip, and a 
grilled meat sandwich along with a cold beer. 
</P>
<P>
Until American beer appeared on the scene, most of the truckers chose Heineken, 
the Dutch beer, but "now everyone wants American," Abu Youssef said the other 
day. He has canceled his longstanding order for Heineken. 
</P>
<P>
He charges the equivalent of 60 cents a can for the beer. For Pepsi-Cola, the 
truckers' favorite soft drink, he gets 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
After eating, a smoke is in order, and the truckers light up one of their 
favorite cigarettes, Marlboro or Lucky Strike. These sell for 60 cents and 30 
cents a pack, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
As they smoke and finish their beer, the radio describes the security situation 
in Beirut, where Muslims and Christians have been killing each other for more 
than a decade, and the Shiite drivers listen with the same concern as Abu 
Youssef. His fellow Lebanese Christians live in East Beirut, and many of the 
drivers have relatives in the southern suburbs of West Beirut, a Shiite 
enclave. 
</P>
<P>
When a new face appears, the drivers stop talking, waiting for Abu Youssef's 
standard joke: "You want a sandwich? With or without bread?" 
</P>
<P>
Abu Youssef also likes to tell about how he learned of American beer, 
especially if there are Americans around to listen. 
</P>
<P>
"One day a couple of summers ago, the Soviet ambassador was here in The Cedars 
on a picnic," he says. "The ambassador came in and asked if I could keep his 
beer in my cooler. And what was the brand? American." 
</P>
<P>
The ambassador gave Abu Youssef a couple of cans as a way of saying thanks, but 
the canny merchant had already decided to put in an order for it. He knew that 
if an American product had the backing of the Soviet ambassador, it had to be 
good. 
</P>
<P>
The ambassador speaks fluent Arabic but no English, so it is not likely that he 
could read the wording on the side of the can: "American beer is a tribute to 
the greatest nation on Earth, a land of freedom and opportunity."

A Western hostage held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Muslim fundamentalist groups 
may soon be freed, Iran's official news agency and Middle East sources said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency did not identify which of the 16 Western 
hostages would be let go, but Damascus-based diplomatic sources said it would 
likely be Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite, while a source in Beirut said it 
may be Irishman Brian Keenan. 
</P>
<P>
The Damascus sources said Waite's church has extended significant aid to the 
victims of last month's earthquake in Iran, which killed an estimated 40,000 
people. A spokesman for the Church of England in London would not put a dollar 
amount on the aid, which he said had been channeled through a handful of 
private agencies. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland, meanwhile, has attempted in recent months to forge stronger ties with 
Iran, and three Irish senators visited Tehran a week ago to appeal for Keenan's 
release. 
</P>
<P>
IRNA quoted well-informed sources in Beirut as saying that the Western hostage 
to be released will probably be a European. 
</P>
<P>
Ten Europeans and six Americans are still held in Beirut by pro-Iranian Shiite 
Muslim groups, which have demanded the release of Shiite prisoners held in 
Israel and other concessions. 
</P>
<P>
Iran has maintained publicly that it is not connected with the fundamentalist 
groups but is widely believed to have considerable influence with the 
kidnapers. 
</P>
<P>
Well-connected Middle East sources confirmed the IRNA report. 
</P>
<P>
"An announcement to this effect would probably be made in Beirut within the 
next two days," a Damascus-based Iranian source said. 
</P>
<P>
Waite was abducted in West Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987, while attempting to 
negotiate the release of other hostages. 
</P>
<P>
Keenan, a Belfast native who holds dual Irish and British citizenship, was an 
English teacher at the American University of Beirut when he was abducted April 
11, 1986, on his way to work.

A stunt plane flown by a space shuttle commander collided with another plane 
during a race at an air show Saturday, sending the second craft hurtling into a 
cornfield and killing its pilot. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was identified as Henry W. Jones Jr., a retired fighter pilot from 
Newport News, Va. 
</P>
<P>
The other plane, a single-engine Cassutt flown by astronaut Robert L. (Hoot) 
Gibson, landed safely at the New Braunfels Municipal Airport, 25 miles 
northeast of San Antonio. No one on the ground was injured, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"The one that crashed was attempting to pass the one that did not crash . . . " 
said Federal Aviation Administration spokesman T. C. Miller. 
</P>
<P>
Jones' Mingus Special, also a single-engine plane, lost a wing in the crash and 
tumbled through the air, breaking into several sections as it crashed, Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, 43, piloted an eight-day Challenger mission in 1984 and commanded the 
1986 Columbia mission and the December, 1988, Atlantis mission.

HUBBLE BUILDERS GOT AWARD FEES, MAGAZINE SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
SPACE: NASA PAID AS MUCH AS $1 MILLION IN BONUSES TO TWO TELESCOPE CONTRACTORS 
FOR THEIR COST-CONTROL EFFORTS, A PUBLICATION REPORTS.

<P>
The government overpaid as much as $1 million in bonuses to two Hubble Space 
Telescope contractors for their cost-control efforts on the device, whose flaws 
have become a major problem for NASA, a magazine reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional Quarterly reported in its Saturday edition that the overpayments 
occurred at the same time costs for the expensive telescope were rising 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
The original cost estimate for the Hubble was $678 million, but its final price 
tag was more than $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine said information about the bonus was contained in a July, 1989, 
audit report by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's office of 
inspector general. The material was obtained through a Freedom of Information 
Act request. 
</P>
<P>
The Hubble telescope was launched April 24 and NASA announced June 27 that its 
two main mirrors would not focus properly. A manufacturing error was suspected. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional Quarterly said the inspector general's report accused NASA 
management of "not properly considering all . . . cost overruns" in figuring 
cost-control bonuses paid to Hubble's two principal contractors, Lockheed Corp. 
and Perkin-Elmer Corp., now Hughes-Danbury Optical Systems Inc., which built 
the telescope's mirrors. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed received $14.4 million in bonuses and Hughes-Danbury was paid $6 
million in bonuses through April 30, 1987, the report said. If NASA had fully 
considered the cost overruns, the bonuses may have been reduced by as much as 
$1 million, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts Saturday to reach either of the contractors and NASA were 
unsuccessful. But Congressional Quarterly quoted project managers at Marshall 
Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., as disagreeing with the audit 
conclusions but promising to implement many of the report's recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
A Lockheed official also took issue with the report. The magazine said 
Hughes-Danbury declined to comment.

SOVIETS MAY LOFT U.S. SATELLITES FOR FIRST TIME

The Bush Administration will allow U.S. commercial satellites to be launched on 
Soviet rockets for the first time, a published report said. 
</P>
<P>
An Australian commercial venture, the Cape York Space Agency, will be permitted 
to hire a U.S. company to run a base in Australia from which Soviet rockets 
will carry satellites for customers from around the world, the New York Times 
reported in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
The project, which could be in operation by 1995, would provide a major 
opportunity for the Soviet Union to expand its international space business and 
would increase competitive pressures on the American rocket industry, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
The National Space Council, an interagency committee headed by Vice President 
Dan Quayle, met last week and completed a broad set of recommendations on the 
international launching business, the paper said, quoting unidentified 
government and industry officials. 
</P>
<P>
The story said the decision to approve the Cape York project was "among the 
thorniest issues involved in the council's policy review." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the space council declined to comment on the report Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the State Department intends to grant an export license to 
the USBI division of United Technologies Corp. to operate the Cape York 
station, where Soviet Zenit rockets could be launched. 
</P>
<P>
The project, estimated to cost nearly $500 million, is backed by an Australian 
real estate development company and would not receive any Australian government 
funds, the newspaper said. The Soviet space agency, Glavkosmos, would supply 
rockets and engineers but would not own a share in the venture. 
</P>
<P>
The Times said Australia and the Soviet Union would have to comply with 
conditions laid out by the United States, including a Soviet promise to limit 
its overseas launching to a single site and to abide by an international 
agreement controlling the export of ballistic missile technologies that have 
commercial and military uses. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. rocket manufacturers fear that they will suffer unfairly in a head-to-head 
competition with Soviet suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
But, the paper said, U.S. satellite companies have warned that, if they are 
prevented from putting their payloads on the cheapest available rockets, they 
will lose business to foreign satellite makers.

"Incredible," was Steger's only reaction after thousands showered him with

The 45-year-old explorer left Ely last July to serve as co-leader of the 
six-member International Trans-Antarctica Expedition, the longest unmechanized

The president of the French branch of the Church of Scientology and five 
colleagues have been arrested in a probe of alleged fraud and illegal practice 
of medicine, court and church officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The president, Daniele Gounord, was arrested Friday in Paris along with the 
church's treasurer and the head of a church foundation. 
</P>
<P>
They were placed under court supervision, but not jailed 
</P>
<P>
Three officials of the Scientologists' branch in Lyon were arrested there in 
the last 10 days -- the local president, treasurer and secretary. They have 
been charged with complicity in fraud and illegal practice of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
All six are to appear in court in Lyon, where an order for Friday's arrests was 
issued by Judge Georges Fenech. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests stem from a police investigation into the suicide of Patrick Vick, 
a Church of Scientology member in Lyon who jumped out of a 12th-floor window in 
1988. Investigators found medicine in his house allegedly provided to him by 
the church in violation of a regulation requiring a doctor's prescription. 
</P>
<P>
Vick's widow filed a complaint in court against the Scientologists' branch in 
Lyon.

Sisters, and the Marx Brothers. A personal friend of the Schuberts, he worked 
many years on Broadway for the Schubert Theatre chain. 
</P>
<P>
Tedeschi also performed on early television shows including "The Lucky Strike 
Hour," "The Jackie Gleason Show," and "The Morey Amsterdam Show." 
</P>

BROMELIADS: THESE PLANTS THRIVE ON THIN AIR AND AN OCCASIONAL MISTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL RAPP 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What could be easier to grow than a plant that can literally subsist on thin 
air? The answer, of course, is nothing, and the plant is the very popular 
bromeliad. 
</P>
<P>
There are almost 2,000 species in this large and fascinating family, which 
includes Aechmea, Vriesia, Guzmania, Billbergia, Tillandsia, Cryptanthus, 
Neoregelia and the bromeliad we're all most familiar with, the pineapple plant 
(Ananus). 
</P>
<P>
Although most bromeliads are very exotic in appearance -- they have beautiful 
coloring, striking leaf designs, breathtaking blooms and always make a dramatic 
statement when used as decor -- they really are the easiest of all plants to 
grow indoors. 
</P>
<P>
Classified somewhere between a foliage plant and a succulent, most bromeliads 
are epiphytes -- plants that in their native Western Hemisphere habitats attach 
themselves to a host, such as a rock or a tree, and then take their nourishment 
directly from the air. 
</P>
<P>
So even in the most unfavorable corner of your house or apartment they need 
only an occasional misting and some water in their cup, or rosette, to keep 
them thriving. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, bromeliads have such small root systems that as long as you keep 
enough water in their centers they can exist for months and even years with no 
roots at all! 
</P>
<P>
The best known example of a pure "air plant," would be Tillandsia usneoides -- 
Spanish moss. You may have seen this silvery gray, rootless beauty hanging off 
the branches of trees in places as diverse and far-ranging as Canada, Florida 
or semi-tropical South America. 
</P>
<P>
It hangs in long, stringy clumps that grow up to 25 feet long. Next time you 
buy a bag of Spanish moss to use as decorative accent, drape a little on the 
branches of your Ficus benjamina or whatever kind of tree-like plant you've 
got. Spray it once in a while and you've got a new houseplant. 
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, bromeliads need only filtered light to thrive and will 
tolerate temperatures from 40 to 90 degrees. They should be given a foliar 
feeding about once a month -- mix a little liquid plant food with water 
according to bottle directions and spray the leaves of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest bromeliad collection I've ever seen was tended by an amateur 
gardener friend of mine who fed his bromeliads by spraying them with 7-Up. 
</P>
<P>
Most people buy their bromeliad when the plant is at its most showy -- usually 
in full bloom. Probably the most commonly seen potted bromeliad is the 
ubiquitous urn plant (A echmea fasciata), which can be found wherever plants 
are sold. Also known as the living vase or fascination flower, this plant has 
large, powdery-looking grayish-green leaves, but what will catch your eye is 
the spectacular spiky rose-and-blue flower that emerges on a stalk from the 
center of its urn. 
</P>
<P>
I have good news and bad news about A. fasciata's glorious flowering. The bad 
news is that the urn plant, like its fellow Aechmeas, blooms only once during 
its lifetime (which can be years and years). The good news is that it will also 
produce profusions of baby plants, or "pups," over the years, and each of these 
will in turn bloom and produce its own pups. 
</P>
<P>
To propagate the urn plant -- and most other bromeliads, for that matter -- 
just cut off the pups or offshoots, they're also called suckers, and root them 
in damp peat moss. Once rooted, allow the peat moss to dry out and begin 
watering into the rosette. 
</P>
<P>
You can force an urn plant -- once again this is true for almost any bromeliad 
-- to bloom prematurely by putting half an apple into the rosette and then 
covering the plant with airtight plastic. 
</P>
<P>
Ethylene gasses will escape from the apple and will literally shock the plant 
into flower, as long as the plant is mature. Blooms should appear within four 
to eight weeks, depending on the species and variety of the plant -- in the 
case of aechmeas about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
One bromeliad that everybody recognizes is the pineapple plant (Ananus 
comosus), whose inflorescence is the familiar supermarket fruit. Its relative, 
the variegated pineapple (A. comosus variegatus), produces those marvelous 
little pink and cream-colored pineapples sold as cut flowers in many florist 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
To propagate a pineapple, twist the top off your store-bought fruit, (some 
people prefer to cut the top off along with about one-half inch of the 
pineapple -- either method will work, but I've had more success with twisting), 
submerge the stub in water until roots appear, which should be about three 
weeks to a month, and then plant it in soil. I've had the best luck with 
pineapple plants when I could keep them in a bright, sunny spot. 
</P>
<P>
Another of my favorite bromeliads is the earth star (Cryptanthus acaulis). The 
earth star looks exactly like its name -- a small (no more than 8 or 10 inches 
in diameter), flattened, star-shaped rosette with stiff green leaves variegated 
with light green or pink. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its striking, unusual look -- almost like a gardener's starfish -- 
and its ease of care, the earth star is a most rewarding plant for your 
children's collection as well as your own. Spray your earth star daily to help 
prevent the tips from drying and turning brown -- but this may happen to the 
lower leaves no matter what you do. When they do turn brown, simply cut them 
off with sharp scissors. 
</P>
<P>
Tillandsias are very popular and are truly air plants. They're usually 
displayed glued to seashells, rocks or pieces of driftwood. I've also seen tiny 
tillandsias planted in interesting little containers with magnets attached to 
the backs so you can put them on your refrigerator door. 
</P>
<P>
Every now and then I stumble across a "bromeliad tree" -- a large, trunk-like 
branch or piece of driftwood, mounted on a stand, and then "planted" with 
several varieties of bromeliads, usually including lots of tillandsias and 
always creating a very sculptural and striking effect. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to make your own bromeliad tree -- simply get the driftwood and a 
small board for a stand, buy a few tillandsias, a cryptanthus, a small vriesia, 
a little guzmania -- whatever turns you on -- and then, one by one, stick them 
to the wood using waterproof glue. Cover the base of each glued-on plant with 
damp spaghnum moss and affix the spaghnum moss to the wood with invisible 
fishing line or thin wire. 
</P>
<P>
Vriesia, by the way, is considered by many bromeliad fanciers to be the Royal 
Family of bromeliads. The flower spikes of vriesias come in many colors, from 
dark red to pale yellow and the leaves usually have some very dramatic 
variegation. 
</P>
<P>
The most familiar neroegelia would be N. spectablilis, commonly called the 
fingernail plant. This bromeliad has a tubular rosette with stiff, glossy, 
narrow, olive-green leaves with gray markings on their undersides. It gets its 
nickname from its red markings around the bottom of the leaves -- around the 
cup -- and its sharp, pointed tips. 
</P>
<P>
Whichever variety you choose, next chance you get, add a spectacular, 
hassle-free bromeliad to your plant-tation. You'll be glad you did.

HOT PROPERTY: GRETZKY'S GOAL: CUT COMMUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hockey star WAYNE GRETZKY has put the Encino house that he bought less than two 
years ago on the market at $3.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
"He's selling because he wants to move closer to where he practices," said 
Asher Dann of Beverly Hills, who has the Los Angeles Kings center's listing. 
"He has to go to the Forum almost every day." 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky has been living in the Encino home since moving to Los Angeles from 
Edmonton, Alberta, with his wife, Janet. They have a 17-month-old daughter, 
Paulina. 
</P>
<P>
Dann described the home, which is about 7,000 square feet in size, as "old but 
updated." "It once belonged to (1942 Academy Award-winning actress) Teresa 
Wright," Dann said. 
</P>
<P>
Gretzky's residence was built in 1939 and has six bedrooms, five baths and two 
powder rooms. Besides the main house, there are two guest cottages, a rock 
swimming pool, three barbecue areas and a driveway more than 100 feet long on 
the gated property. 
</P>
<P>
KCBS sportscaster KEITH OLBERMANN is settling into his new home, a condo in 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
He liked the unit because it is on a quiet street and he can sleep during the 
day when he has late telecasts. It has high ceilings (he is about 6-feet-6), 
and is within walking distance of restaurants and shops. Olbermann doesn't 
drive, according to sources not involved in the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Olbermann bought the 1,900-square-foot unit -- with two bedrooms, a den and 2 
1/2 baths -- for about $500,000. The condo is one of several penthouses in a 
three-story, 24-unit building constructed 16 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The condo had been listed with Annette Bravos and Betsy Emanuel in the Santa 
Monica office of Fred Sands Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
Interior designers IAN and LINDA PHILLIPS have put their own house in Woodland 
Hills on the market at $1,050,000 in preparation for a world cruise on their 
60-foot ketch "The Designing Lady." 
</P>
<P>
"We're putting our business on hiatus and taking off to play on the boat for a 
year," Linda said. 
</P>
<P>
They've only been married for a year but have had an interior design business 
together for about seven years. 
</P>
<P>
The couple have spent the past two years redesigning a 7,500-square-foot La 
Canada Flintridge home. 
</P>
<P>
There is a home for sale in Apple Valley that is said to have 400-year-old 
post-and-beam timbers in it from three cottages built in Elizabethan England. 
</P>
<P>
British authorities allowed the materials to be exported, the builder said, 
because the cottages were about to be demolished to make way for new 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
James A.G. Webster, who came from England himself, took 10 years to build the 
home, which he describes as "a new English manor house." It was completed about 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"He lived in it for awhile, but now he has a ranch in the San Joaquin Valley," 
said Markham Kopang at Bradco Development in Victorville, who is handling the 
$1.4-million home, on slightly more than an acre. The 4,300-square-foot house 
has four bedrooms and 5 1/2 baths. 
</P>
<P>
The former Palm Springs estate of 20th Century Fox studio chief DARRYL F. 
ZANUCK is back on the market at $1.5 million. Its current owner, Zanuck's 
daughter, Darrylin Zanuck De Pineda, first listed it in 1987, then changed her 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I think she's serious about selling," said a spokeswoman for Eadie Adams 
Realty, the listing brokerage firm. 
</P>
<P>
The 1.5-acre property, behind walls in the Old Movie Colony area of town, is 
where Zanuck entertained dozens of Hollywood stars until he died in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a huge lawn . . . where Daddy would play croquet until 2 in the 
morning," De Pineda recalled in a prepared statement. "He and (director) Howard 
Hawks were such fierce croquet competitors that the neighbors often called the 
police to break up fights." 
</P>
<P>
The Early California-style, 7,500-square-foot estate also has a main house with 
four bedrooms and four baths and a two-bedroom apartment over a three-car 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
After Darryl and his wife, Virginia, bought the estate in the late 1930s, they 
named it Ric Su Dar for their three children -- Richard, co-producer of 
"Driving Miss Daisy;" Susan, who died in 1980, and Darrylin, who inherited the 
property when Virginia died in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Clarification: Summit Ridge, the Chatsworth development where White Snake 
guitarist STEVE VAI bought a lot for a $2-million house he is now building, 
also has some completed houses on the market, said Georgiana D'Angelo of 
Coldwell Banker, who has a $1.87-million listing on one.

4 IN 5 GOOD SHOWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Survey Shows Agents Left 1 in 5 Unhappy," (June 24) does a disservice to the 
real estate profession. Referring to a recent Consumer Reports article, you 
state that "during the latter half of the 1980s, real estate agencies left one 
in five home sellers dissatisfied." 
</P>
<P>
One might then logically extrapolate that the other four of those five sellers 
were satisfied. Admittedly, it would be nice if the positive responses were 
higher, but I don't think an 80% client satisfaction rating in a difficult 
profession is cause for hanging one's head in shame. I seriously doubt that 
bankers, stockbrokers, lawyers and architects would score any higher. 
</P>
<P>
The next time you address this issue, perhaps it would be better that you 
direct your attention to the fact that the glass is four-fifths full rather 
than one-fifth empty.

SANTA CLARITA CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I enjoyed reading Sharon Rose's article on the Santa Clarita Valley (At Home, 
July 1). I too chose this area a few years ago as a terrific place to put down 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
I would like to add a little to the picture Rose paints of this area, because 
many of us believe that things aren't quite so rosy. The article correctly 
notes the concern residents feel about the traffic congestion throughout the 
SCV. However, as Jerry Reynolds and Ruth Newhall's comments point out, the real 
villain is uncontrolled development. 
</P>
<P>
This unplanned growth (which includes 28,000 county-approved, but as yet 
unbuilt housing units) has also adversely affected the local school systems. 
Besides overcrowding, this has caused the creation of "portable" schools using 
the commercial equivalent of mobile homes as classrooms and offices. 
</P>
<P>
Another situation that Rose does not touch upon is that the city of L.A., 
together with the county, plans to create a 190-million-ton dump in the 
southeast corner of the valley. This canyon empties into the Santa Clara River 
Wash, the source of 60% of the valley's drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
There are already three "landfills" and the dump at the county prison at 
Pitchess Honor Rancho. 
</P>
<P>
Don't get me wrong. I like living in the Santa Clarita Valley. We have less 
smog, quiet neighborhoods, high-quality education (so far!), and lower-priced 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
We also have a major traffic problem, crowded schools, few local jobs and a 
threatened water supply. All of us who purchase houses to live in rather resell 
soon learn that there's more to the neighborhood than the realtor's dog and 
pony show lets on. Consider this letter a peek behind the curtain.

PRAISE FOR WORLD CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leon Whiteson's critique (July 1) of the First Interstate World Center seemed 
to express a negative opinion of the overall exterior tower, but he is specific 
only when discussing the "awkward change of levels at the shaft's base. The 
"main lobby of 5th Street . . . is confusing" and "The lobby's connection to 
the Hope Street entry four floors above is poorly thought out," may be valid, 
but hardly cause to condemn the building as "an act of architecture only 
secondarily." 
</P>
<P>
Your photograph rightly shows the "slim white cylinder," and that "the tower 
stands out as the graceful beacon visible for miles," (Whiteson's words from 
the story). Your pictured view is the one I have the opportunity to appreciate 
every day, and to me the upward thrust of the 73 stories is fine; 20 stories 
less would seem abruptly stubby. 
</P>
<P>
Also I do not think that deals "limited the size of its site," was not the size 
of that site the same before the "deals" as after? As for THAT building ever 
being "our equivalent of Manhattan's Chrysler Building," try putting the 
mandatory heliport on top of a pointy headed building.

APARTMENT LIFE: LAW SPECIFIC ON SECURITY DEPOSIT DEDUCTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, Postema is the editor of Apartment Age magazine, a 
publication of The Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, an apartment owners' 
service group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I am an apartment manager in Long Beach. I was always told that as 
long as a tenant left an apartment with no damage and broom swept, there were 
to be no charges against, or money taken from, the security deposit. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I am hearing from a lot of people that their landlords are charging them 
for cleaning carpets, drapes and general apartment cleaning. They say that 
whatever the cleaning company charges the landlord, is what the landlord 
charges them for cleaning. Is this legal? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: In California, money may be deducted from security deposits for any of 
three different purposes. They include paying for cleaning a unit, to repair 
damages to a unit above and beyond "normal wear and tear," and to compensate 
for unpaid rent. 
</P>
<P>
This "broom swept" concept has nothing to do with California law, or the manner 
in which most courts interpret it. Forget about it. 
</P>
<P>
As for carpets and drapes, many small claims courts, where security deposit 
disputes are usually settled, say that three years constitutes "normal wear and 
tear" for them. Thus, they reason, no money can logically be spent from a 
tenant's security deposit for cleaning after a tenancy of at least three years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Water Law May Help Get Drip Fixed 
</P>
<P>
Q: I live in Los Angeles. For some time now, there has been a dripping sound 
coming from somewhere underneath my apartment unit. During the day it isn't so 
bad, but at night it is quite evident that something is wrong with the 
plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
A plumber was here in March and he was unable to find anything wrong. After I 
sent him a letter in April, the landlord came to look into the problem. He 
turned off the hot water circulation pump to see if that was the source of the 
problem. It was not. 
</P>
<P>
He then theorized that maybe the pipes were expanding and contracting with 
changes in temperature. He also said he'd have another plumber find and fix 
whatever is causing the noise. The drip continues. 
</P>
<P>
I have lived here for four years and like the apartment very much. I also like 
the landlord. He is usually very prompt in making necessary repairs, so I 
cannot understand why he continues to ignore this one. Please let me know my 
options for having this very disturbing sound eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
Also, after four years the walls of my apartment are becoming quite dingy. 
There are cracks in the plaster and some crumbling plaster under the windows 
where the rain has seeped through. 
</P>
<P>
Who is responsible for this interior maintenance (plaster and crack repair, and 
repainting)? 
</P>
<P>
A: It sounds like the owner has made some efforts to repair the leak, but since 
it has persisted for so long, it seems as if he is ignoring the problem. Fear 
not, for Mayor Tom Bradley's new mandatory water rationing plan will provide 
your owner with added motivation, monetary penalties for excess water usage, to 
repair the leak, if that's the problem. 
</P>
<P>
While the California Civil Code requires your landlord to maintain your 
apartment in a safe and habitable condition, I'm not sure that it requires him 
to fix outside leaks or noises that sound like them. (Is there any evidence of 
a leak on the ground or in a lower apartment?) 
</P>
<P>
If all else fails, you may be able to get some kind of a rent reduction for a 
"reduction in services," further motivation to the owner to fix the problem, 
from the Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Division (RSD), assuming that your unit 
is covered by rent control. 
</P>
<P>
Now, to your second question, replastering and repainting. While replastering, 
fixing the cracked and crumbling plaster, is a health and safety issue, for 
which the owner is responsible, repainting isn't. It is an aesthetic issue for 
which you are responsible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Unmarried Tenants Protected by Laws 
</P>
<P>
Q: I live in a three-bedroom, first-floor duplex on Balboa Island with one male 
roommate and one female roommate. Our yearly lease is up on Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The agent for the owner has indicated to us that she will not rerent the 
apartment to a co-ed situation (unmarried male and female). The realtor says 
these new rental rules were made by the owner. Is this legal? What are our 
rights, if any? 
</P>
<P>
A: Refusing to renew your lease because of your marital status is not legal in 
California under our state's fair housing laws, the Rumford and Unruh acts. You 
should make the realtor and owner aware of this. If they still refuse to renew 
the lease, you can sue them for discrimination based upon marital status. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Owner May Not Discount on Rent 
</P>
<P>
Q: We moved into our Burbank apartment on May 15, 1988. We got our first rent 
increase in March, 1990. The rent was increased from $650 to $725. However, the 
owner also gave us a 10% "discount" provided that we pay the rent by the fifth 
of the month, which made our rent $652.50. 
</P>
<P>
We thought that this was too good to be true, and we were right. On May 1 he 
advised us that in June our rent would be increased to $790. Again, though, he 
gave us a 10% discount for paying by the fifth, which made our rent $711. 
</P>
<P>
The owner is in the process of selling the building and indicates that the 
prospective owner requested that he raise the rent. Our concern is that the new 
owner will remove the discount and thereby increase our rent to $790. 
</P>
<P>
Since Burbank does not have a rent control law, we are wondering if we have any 
recourse if this should happen. 
</P>
<P>
A: Not really. The new owner could eliminate the 10% rent discount for prompt 
payment of rent, which is legal, with a 30-day Notice of Change of Terms of 
Tenancy. If he does so, you will either have to pay the increase or move.

WAYS TO COOL HOUSE AND CUT ENERGY BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The onset of summer can also bring on concerns about cooling costs, but take 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
Some warm weather savvy from Home Plan Ideas magazine will allow homeowners to 
minimize their home's heat buildup on hot summer days and will also help take 
the heat off their cooling budget. 
</P>
<P>
Anything that stops the sun before it gets into the house reduces heat buildup 
dramatically. Here are a few additions that do the trick: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Attach awnings. Buy either ready-made fabric awnings or aluminum models, or 
build wood awnings that tie in architecturally with the house. Concentrate on 
east- and west-facing windows. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mount outside sun screens. Block the sun by covering windows that receive 
direct sunlight with screening of bamboo, wood, fiberglass or polypropylene. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hang light-colored interior shades. Once the sun gets through windows, the 
object is to send it back out. Shades with shiny outer surfaces work best. Some 
roll-up fabric shades are backed by light-reflective material. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Install heat-reflecting or low-emissivity windows. These windows contain a 
thin film sealed inside conventional double-pane glass to slow heat gain in 
summer and heat loss in winter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Insulate the attic. Proper insulation will help keep the heat that builds 
up in the attic (up to 150 degrees) from entering the house. 
</P>

It's easy to underestimate the importance of proper air movement in maintaining 
a comfortable indoor climate. The following suggestions are inexpensive, 
practical ways to combat the buildup of warm air. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cross ventilate. Exhaust air any time the temperature outside is cooler 
than it is inside. One open window won't do; make sure air can come in one 
opening and leave freely through another. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Install a whole-house fan. If the humidity isn't too uncomfortable mount a 
whole-house fan in the ceiling just below the attic. These fans are designed to 
draw cool air in through open windows at night and push hot air out through 
attic vents.

<P>
 -- Ernest Hemingway in a letter to Charles A. Fenton, Oct. 9, 1952. 
</P>
<P>
Novelist MacDonald Harris' "The Hemingway Suitcase" devilishly takes this 
notion further, cagily playing with the idea of whether Papa knows best. 
</P>
<P>
"Suitcase" is a savvy, kicky read guaranteed to delight not only Hemingway 
die-hards but those eager to get at the nature of "art" -- what, indeed, makes 
an original unique, or can genius be faked? 
</P>
<P>
The premise, the "device," on which "Suitcase" sprightly springs, concerns a 
true incident in Hemingway's life: Several years ago a superb action/adventure 
novel, "The Hemingway Papers" by Vincent Cosgrove, was the first to take this 
episode and embellish it winningly with fiction. And for Hemingway cognoscenti, 
this event has become rife with significance, as crucial as invention of the 
printing press, as meaningfully mysterious as a visitation by the Virgin Mary. 
</P>
<P>
The incident, which occurred in late December, 1922, is noted by Hemingway in 
"A Moveable Feast" and receives half a paragraph in Carlos Baker's biography, 
"Ernest Hemingway." As Baker reports, Hemingway's first wife, Hadley, before 
catching a train from Paris to Switzerland to meet her husband, had packed all 
his manuscripts (except for "Up in Michigan" and "My Old Man") " . . . in a 
separate small valise so that he (Hemingway) could get on with his writing 
during the Christmas season." However, at the Gare de Lyon someone swiped the 
bag holding Hemingway's pages -- poems and short stories and the beginning of a 
novel never again seen. 
</P>
<P>
That is, not until publication of "Hemingway's Suitcase." Anyway, that's part 
of the appealing invention of this novel. For within the context of 
"Suitcase's" fiction are presented five short stories that might or might not 
be authentic E. H. pieces. 
</P>
<P>
I use the conditional since Nils-Frederik Glas -- the fellow in "Hemingway's 
Suitcase" who supposedly has taken possession of the long-lost Hemingway 
manuscripts -- is, himself, a writer (whose own flawed novel borrows much from 
Henry James) and someone who delights in paradox and games. Thus the issue on 
which "Hemingway's Suitcase" pivots is whether Nils-Frederik did, in fact, 
somehow get hold of Hadley's legendary purloined luggage or cleverly faked the 
stories that we have been given to read. 
</P>
<P>
As one character delineates the conflict: "He (Nils-Frederik) has stolen 
something from someone else. He has stolen from a dead man. And he wishes to 
offer what he has stolen as something that belongs to him. . . . Or he has made 
a very clever counterfeit of something, and he wishes us to believe it is real. 
I don't know which. 
</P>
<P>
Among those in "Suitcase" to whom this riddle is of more than passing concern 
are a friend of Nils-Frederik, a dealer of rare manuscripts named Wolf Ober who 
plays a hand in determining the final fate of the perhaps-Hemingway stories, 
and Nils-Frederik's son Alan, a literary agent in Los Angeles who is trying to 
sell the "found" stories to New York publishers for a sizeable sum -- a book 
that will identify Nils-Frederik as editor but never directly state that these 
stories are truly Hemingway's because of possible problems with the Hemingway 
estate. (Remember, if the stories are genuine they're hot property in more ways 
than one, having been filched from Hadley at the Gare de Lyon on that long-ago 
December day.) 
</P>
<P>
Without hemming on whether Hemingway's "lost writing" found in "Suitcase" turns 
out to be true or false (obviously, in a larger sense, the rediscovered 
literature folded into "Suitcase" is the product of Harris, unless "Suitcase" 
is an even wilier packing job than it appears), suffice it to say that this 
novel explores more than merely the question of whether the stories are cunning 
copies or "the true gen," as Hemingway would put it. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, the book is an absorbing inquiry into the nature of fact and fiction, 
art and artifice, done up as a novel. The literary hoax, the creaking bough on 
which our notions of artistic merit lie: Such are the issues that "Hemingway's 
Suitcase" confidently encompasses. Harris even gives us snippets of reviews 
weighing in on Nils-Frederik's book of maybe-yes/maybe-no Hemingway. 
</P>
<P>
As to the quality of Harris' Hemingway, it is top-notch. Though he does flirt 
with parody -- e.g. "There's the good Swiss wine and the schnapps, and we could 
ski in daytime" goes the dialogue in one of his Papa pieces titled "The Trouble 
With People" (then again, even Hemingway sometimes sounds like parody 
Hemingway) -- in the main, Harris' Hemingway comes across as good and fine and 
not something made-up, but things as they would truly be. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the stories are modeled after Hemingway's early Paris writing but 
feature "In Our Times' " Nick Adams as protagonist, and have the blunt, 
vigorous language and telegraphic "cablese" that Hemingway championed, the sort 
of rat-a-tat-tat talk that distinguishes his formative work in Paris. In fact, 
one of the pieces placed in "Suitcase," "The Lady With the Dog," contains a 
negative reference to W. H. Hudson's "The Purple Land," a novel that 
Hemingway's Jake Barnes tells us in "The Sun Also Rises" is "a very sinister" 
book, yet one favored by "Sun's" confused central character, Robert Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
Quite so, after reading Harris' Hemingway, one does think of "The Sun Also 
Rises" and how good the writing is and how playwright Tom Stoppard said it 
contains " . . . one of the greatest paragraphs ever written in English . . . " 
the section in which Hemingway has Jake talk of a bull that earlier had killed 
one matador but then was killed by Pedro Romero, and how the ear of the bull 
was given to Romero "who, in turn, gave it to Brett, who wrapped it in a 
handkerchief belonging to myself, and left both ear and handkerchief, along 
with a number of Muratti cigarette stubs, shoved far back in the drawer of the 
bed table that stood beside her bed in the Hotel Montoya in Pamplona." As 
Stoppard says: "When I read this paragraph I always think of some heavy objects 
bumping slowly down a flight of stairs, and in some way picking up not moss as 
it rolls but bits and pieces, objects, debris, fragments of the whole novel. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
Hell, I've done it . . . gone from Harris to Hemingway. Yet this can't be 
helped after reading Harris' version of young Papa's prose. 
</P>
<P>
So is it real or ingenious mimicry? Can a counterfeit surpass the original? 
</P>
<P>
In an Andy Warhol world shelved with imitation margarine and genuine artificial 
sweeteners, distinctions blur, turn fuzzy. Only ambiguity pops into focus; only 
uncertainty endures.

"A hoy there, mate! We've gathered many a treasure from foreign shores. . . ." 
Who said that? Relax, it's only the electronically wired pirate dummy stationed 
by the front door, the first clue that you've embarked on a voyage into the 
unusual. Indeed, the nautical treasures waiting to be discovered in The Sea are 
wondrous and plentiful -- much like the wonders of the sea itself. 
</P>
<P>
A circus of giant fiberglass dolphins, sharks and whales hangs from the 
ceiling. Skeletons of sea mammals adorn the walls. As you navigate your way 
through the aisles, you'll encounter shells most landlubbers never knew 
existed, scrimshaw, minerals, fossils, ships in bottles and naval relics. If 
it's related to the seven seas, you'll find it here -- somewhere. MARK EHRMAN

EVER WONDER WHO,besides Princess Di and Paul McCartney, can afford a $9,500 
stove? Well, if you think you might, you may as well get your money's worth and 
go for one that bakes, boils, broils, steams, fries, stews, roasts, simmers, 
grills and toasts -- simultaneously: the legendary British AGA (Amalgamated Gas 
Accumulator) Cooker, a cast-iron, hand-enameled work of art that never sleeps. 
The stove's four large ovens and two hot plates are stoked to their optimum 
temperatures; once there, the stove stays on constantly. 
</P>
<P>
If you've read this far, it may be time to see one up close and take the risk 
of being smitten. You'll find a blue one just like Di's (it also comes in red, 
green, black, white, brown and ivory) in situ, at Smallbone Showroom; or you 
can all AGA's U.S. agent and ask for its full-color brochure and accompanying 
20-minute how-to videotape. CHLOE ROSS The AGA Cooker is available through

ONE-THIRD THE LENGTH OF THE CELEBRATED STAGE PRESENTATION, PETER BROOK'S FILM 
OF 'THE MAHABHARATA' IS A REVELATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cinema has a poetry that makes it possible to be realistic and artificial at 
the same time -- that's what I was looking for . . . how to be realistic and 
minimalist is what put me in the studio. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 -- Director Peter Brook 
</P>
<P>
"Honey, I Shrunk the Play" might be a catchy subtitle for Peter Brook's film of 
"The Mahabharata." Flippancy aside, it is precisely what Brook has done, 
condensing his epic nine-hour stage version of the 100,000-stanza Sanskrit poem 
to a stylized three hours of screen time. 
</P>
<P>
How does "The Mahabharata" work as a film? Impressively. OK, let's come right 
out and say it: Better in many ways. 
</P>
<P>
This is the faintly disloyal reaction of a theatergoer who sat through the Zen 
rigors of "The Mahabharata's" stage incarnations twice: once in French, at 
Brook's claustrophobic Bouffes du Nord in Paris, where one realistically 
breathed the dust of the battle scenes and eyed with alarm the closeness of 
numerous oxygen-consuming fires on stage -- and once in English, in the 
air-conditioned vastness of a Raleigh Studios sound stage during the 1987 Los 
Angeles Festival, where it seemed entirely too remote. 
</P>
<P>
It is also the response of someone who had always suspected that Brook could 
have put the "Mahabharata's" message across on stage just as effectively in 
seven hours as in nine, and for whom the real shock is to have fallen so far 
short of the mark. At a taut and unhurried three hours, the movie's sheer 
density is the result of heady distillation, its impact exponentially 
strengthened and purified as if magically squared by the fewer number of hours 
it takes to get through it. 
</P>
<P>
If this isn't exactly new math, it is uncommon artistic redaction. "The 
Mahabharata," after all, is the Greatest Story Ever Told in something other 
than a Judeo-Christian context. It is a dazzling philosophical fable, whose 
aphoristic parables and proverbs are its beating heart. The very word 
Mahabharata loosely translates as "The Story of Mankind," and the exploits and 
events that unfold in it touch on every aspect of human behavior. 
</P>
<P>
It is a tale of good and evil, of the co-existence of the good Pandavas and the 
bad Kauravas perceived as both sides of the human condition, since these are 
neo-cousins descended of two brothers: the blind King Dhritharashtra (father of 
the malcontent and bellicose Kauravas) and his sibling King Pandu. Pandu's 
sons, however, are not strictly speaking his. Because of a curse placed on him 
early on, they are the offspring of his flesh-and-blood wife in a series of 
unions with benevolent gods. The double implication is that the inability to 
see (read understand) gives rise to cataclysmic angers, and that no earthly 
child can be good who is not brushed with some divinity. 
</P>
<P>
In India, there are those who believe "The Mahabharata" to be a true story of a 
terrible conflict dating back thousands of years, those who consider it simply 
a magnificent fairy tale, and those who see it as an illustrated prescription 
for the proper conduct of one's life. 
</P>
<P>
Brook himself chooses to treat it as a glorious myth. He makes no pretense at 
Indian authenticity. His "Mahabharata" is, he said, "refracted" through the 
sensibilities of his multinational company. It is an India shaped by 
non-Indians, flavored and designed for non-Indians, dressed up in Indian colors 
and paraphernalia and filled with haunting neo-Indian chants played on real 
Indian instruments. Ersatz to the purist, but certainly Indian in essence, 
which is what Brook wanted to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
A story with so many tangential and not-so-tangential asides, plots within 
plots, lessons within lessons that illuminate behavior, demands plenty of 
engagement. It requires not only that we listen and watch, but see and hear. 
Film makes us do that better. The overwhelming virtue of Jean-Claude Carriere's 
play script was its lucidity. When Brook translated it from French into 
English, a more ascetic language, its spareness was enhanced. In the film 
script, where every word counts three times as much, it is even leaner. "The 
Mahabharata" on film implodes like a black hole. 
</P>
<P>
Brook, who has said that "the great invention of the cinema is the close-up," 
pretty much debunks the already discredited notion that film demands that a 
play be "opened up." The close-up is a tool the theater does not possess. "The 
Mahabharata's" charged spiritual and philosophical content cries not for the 
outward trappings of spectacle on film but for a single-minded austerity: the 
camera's inward eye, zeroing in on a thought or emotion with the tenacity of a 
steel trap. Brook uses it with impunity. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of widening his lens, he narrows it, forcing us to 
</P>
<P>
focus on essentials. This reduction to underscore effect is a fascinating 
phenomenon. Even though he has only made 10 films, Brook has acknowledged his 
passion for the medium. "In the theater, an image can't invade your mind," he 
told a reporter. "The great quality of the theater is that you are involved and 
free. The cinema is hypnotic and, in a way, brainwashing." 
</P>
<P>
Or simply manipulative. In this case, ideally so. Beyond the poem itself and 
the way Brook plays with shadow and surface and magnified faces, there remains 
an old bone of contention: the voices. Brook has been loyal to most of the same 
actors who were in the play (most of them from his Center for International 
Theatre Research in Paris) and has used them in the film. But these players are 
an ambulatory Tower of Babel representing 36 nations, 35 of which, on the 
evidence, are presumably non-English speaking. 
</P>
<P>
Having this magnificent text rendered in tortured, if not fractured, speech 
(English or French) is an arguable choice that Brook has always defended. At 
least the technological refinements of dubbing and amplification make listening 
to it on film less arduous than listening to it on stage. One could even go a 
step further and make a case for the extra attention one is forced to pay to 
untangle some of the words. In a funny way, the combination of deliberate 
pacing and labored speech play into the director's hand. Each exchange must be 
so carefully delivered that it gives the appearance of having been conceived 
from some center of deep, primordial thought. 
</P>
<P>
This heightens impact, marshaling our attention in a way a play rarely can. 
</P>
<P>
(The recent Mark Taper Forum production of Samuel Beckett's "Eh, Joe," a 
one-act initially written for television, was an interesting exception. It 
managed a potent effect by emulating film -- projecting a close-up of the lone, 
silent actor's face on a cubic screen center stage, which represented the room 
or cell or mind that confined him. Then the director amplified the only sound 
around: the whispered voice of the man's tormentor -- a woman he hears in his 
head. It worked.) 
</P>
<P>
It is not the first time that this kind of implosion has enhanced a stage 
property that is transferred to the screen. Terry Hughes' dynamic 1982 
videotaping of Stephen Sondheim's "Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet 
Street" was another case of small being startlingly more beautiful -- moodier, 
more intense, clearer in its delineation of tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
The use of divided images for songs in many voices and the dissolving of one 
image into the next enriched the texture and sheer power of the work. Camera 
technique magnified and vivified a musical that, in its original run at the 
cavernous Uris Theatre on Broadway, had been all but engulfed by the wrong kind 
of empty space and, in a misguided attempt to reduce that cavity, dwarfed by a 
functionless, overpowering set. 
</P>
<P>
The camera's eye is a formidable presence. Like the "Mahabharata's" gods, it 
programs our responses. We are compelled to see and hear whatever it dictates. 
It moves us through "The Mahabharata's" hyper-reality as if through water, 
while the myth, pregnant with the ruthless sense of time's eternity, doles out 
its premeditated wisdoms. It is mesmerizing. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to pitched battles, even the most rudimentary camera effects are 
easily more impressive than the theater's stylized resourcefulness. On stage, 
for all of its carefully chosen symbolism (a wheel to represent a chariot, an 
arrow carried through the air to find its target), the grinding battle scenes 
of the third part, itself almost three hours long, seemed woefully repetitive 
and, at Les Bouffes, asphyxiating. 
</P>
<P>
The film's relative brevity is an asset. It doesn't take much expertise to 
divine that this clash of juggernauts was shot on a sound stage (at Joinville 
Studios) for about 2 1/2 centimes. There's not a single extra. Makeup and smoke 
screen a lot of budgetary shortcomings. "It is a trick of darkness we need," 
says Krishna -- or a trick of light. The entire film was made for something 
less than $6 million -- or the cost of a fancy Broadway musical. 
</P>
<P>
Arjuna's failure of nerve at the point of battle triggers the most arresting 
scene of the "Mahabharata" movie. In it lies a quintessential message about 
war: "Victory and defeat, pleasure and pain are all the same. Act, but don't 
reflect on the fruits of the act. Forget desire; seek detachment . . . You must 
rise up free from hope and throw yourself into battle. 
</P>
<P>
"You must learn to see with the same eye a mound of earth and a heap of gold, a 
cow and a sage, a dog and the man who eats the dog." 
</P>
<P>
On stage this was a moment easily lost in the endless shuffle. On screen, the 
story halts and turns inward, while the god Vishna pours his wisdom into the 
anguished hero, giving him the chance to rally his strength before making his 
choices -- and us the opportunity to experience the process with him. 
</P>
<P>
That ability to pull us through its experience, to make us experience its 
fairly rarefied spiritual reaches, which was true of "Mahabharata"-the-play, is 
even truer of "Mahabharata"-the-film. It won't be for all markets. But, "If you 
listen carefully," says Vyasa, the author of the great poem, to an inquiring 
boy, "at the end, you'll be someone else." Enabling us to listen carefully so 
we can be changed is the film's understated triumph.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The marketplace in this Finnish border town was an incongruous pageant of 
feathers and beads, bandannas, fringed deerskin and painted shirts as 
Blackfoot/American Indian ceremonialist Charles Lawrence rattled his spirit 
staff, thereby signaling the opening of Joensuu's Meeting of the Worlds 
festival. 
</P>
<P>
At his bidding, about 1,500 spectators held hands and mimicked his Navajo 
prayer, a mighty "ya-hey-ya-hey-ya" cutting across the Babel of languages in 
the square. The chant unleashed an affirmation of positive energy that remained 
the hallmark of the 31-concert international performance festival, held between 
June 19 and 23. 
</P>
<P>
"We, as two-leggeds, must never forget the spirit. It is a spirit working 
through the people that will truly bring the greatest changes for the Earth," 
Lawrence, an Anaheim native, told the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
As optimism peaked during this season of the white nights, and as families 
prepared for the traditional lakeside bonfires, solemn saunas, drinking and 
song that mark the celebration of Midsummer's Eve, Joensuu was preoccupied by a 
sprawling festival. Ostensibly, the focus was music, with theater, dance and 
performance art the minor keys. But revealed in its subtext was a concern for 
building bridges across cultures, for finding common ground through the arts 
and exploring the theme of borders -- political, psychological and conceptual. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, San Diego art theorist Allan Kaprow, New York actor Arthur 
Strimling and Oakland large-scale public performance artist Suzanne Lacy 
utilized the town's special geography and history to plan a constellation of 
more or less connected happenings. These included a Christo-like wrapping of 
the banks of a nearby lagoon and Illosari Island ("Island of Happiness") with 
several hundred teen-age swimmers, clad in red and waving white towels, as well 
as Kaprow's outlining on the ground in chalk images of couples meeting in the 
marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
The global gathering, orchestrated by Performing Artists for Nuclear 
Disarmament (PAND) activists in Finland and the United States, brought out 
participants of every musical stripe, including Los Angeles Philharmonic music 
director-designate Esa-Pekka Salonen, the San Francisco-based Kronos Quartet, 
noted singers Martina Arroyo and Christa Ludwig, composer Henrik Otto Donner, 
the Leningrad Philharmonic and new wave guitarist David Byrne. There were Lapp 
and Gypsy folk singers, the Japanese drummer Eitetsu Hayashi, a tango orchestra 
and Sakhile, a South African band. 
</P>
<P>
In support of PAND's platform, all artists performed gratis, and proceeds of 
the festival are to be donated to UNICEF. (Festival organizers say a profit was 
made, but the tallying was still on-going last week and no figures were 
available.) 
</P>
<P>
If culture has all too often been used by governments as a malign instrument of 
propaganda, in Joensuu, the power of music was almost tangible as a benign 
uniting force among individuals. 
</P>
<P>
There was, for instance, the performance of Shostakovitch's Fifth Symphony with 
Mariss Jansons leading the Leningrad Philharmonic in their first Finnish 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
In 1937, that same orchestra under Evgeny Mravinsky played the triumphant 
premiere of this work, thus introducing what instantly became one of the most 
popular and enduring 20th-Century symphony classics. 
</P>
<P>
Following a performance calibrated slowly to wring out all the pain and pathos 
in the music, Jansons (whose father, Arvit Jansons, was the No. 2 conductor to 
Mravinsky) acknowledged a stormy ovation by playing an encore, the "Valse 
Triste" of Finland's national hero, composer Jean Sibelius. Five years ago such 
a gesture would have been unthinkable -- Sibelius wrote the piece as a protest 
against Russian oppression of Finland. 
</P>
<P>
Another Soviet presence was Boris Grebenshikov, a rock vocalist/guitarist with 
matinee idol looks, and his backing group, Aquarium. Forced underground as a 
performer during the Brezhnev regime, Grebenshikov embarked on his career by 
studying tapes he purchased on the black market. Nonetheless, he gathered a 
following in the U.S.S.R. and remains in demand -- glasnost notwithstanding. 
Joensuu was his second appearance in the West, the first being Montreal just 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Finnish-born conductor-composer Esa-Pekka Salonen, whose very career and 
artistic existence defy man-made borders (his musical orbit now includes 
Germany, Italy, England and the United States), well appreciates the politics 
of music. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason classical music is so universal is partly because it has been 
considered not dangerous, socially speaking," Salonen said during a break in 
rehearsals. 
</P>
<P>
"So you can play a Beethoven symphony anywhere, and you don't threaten the 
system. In a way, it's a pity. I'd rather like to deal with something a bit 
more dangerous, especially because I don't drive or do anything else risky. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
Salonen did seem to be flirting with the unconventional in some rather 
venturesome programming -- in addition to a composition of his own, "FLOOF," 
inspired by a Polish science-fiction novel, he presented two works by rock 
musician Frank Zappa juxtaposed with two Mozart symphonies. "FLOOF," which 
starts from a primitive syntax and develops towards discopunk, emits along the 
way some incomprehensible sounds, like burping ("and so forth, no other 
description needed," said Salonen). 
</P>
<P>
His festival appearances were with Avantil, a chamber orchestra he founded in 
1983 together with a group of young Helsinki musicians, and which is now his 
main performance vehicle in Finland. Salonen, who estimates he spends no more 
than 25 days a year in Finland, maintains a cottage close to Helsinki for those 
infrequent visits. 
</P>
<P>
Though he by no means sees himself as Finland's cultural ambassador to Los 
Angeles -- he's committed to healthy mixes in styles and nationalities in terms 
of composers he introduces -- he is enough of a patriot to have volunteered his 
services in Joensuu, along with leading Finnish baritone Jorma Hynninen and 
basso Jakko Ryhanen. 
</P>
<P>
Besides throwing his support behind an event he deems important, for Salonen 
Joensuu represented an opportunity to reconnect with his native country and to 
speak his mother tongue. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the great things here," he said, switching reflexively between Finnish 
and English as he fielded questions in the lobby of his hotel, "is that when I 
walk in the street, on almost every corner, I see a familiar face. When I 
conduct a Finnish orchestra, it's a very odd feeling -- oh, yes, it's our 
Esa-Pekka who's back." 
</P>
<P>
Then to a more universal note: "The goals of this festival are special. Artists 
don't readily recognize limitations. Sometimes impenetrable walls turn out to 
be sliding doors." 
</P>
<P>
On the shores of Lake Ladoga, Europe's largest lake, situated 150 kilometers 
from the Joensuu marketplace, Russian and Finnish folk groups crooned their 
songs about lost youth, birch trees, and nostalgia for Karelia (that geographic 
region shared by eastern Finland and western Russia) of old. 
</P>
<P>
In what represented the final Midsummer's Day concert of the Meeting of the 
Worlds festival, as well as the first cross-cultural event to be held in 
Sortavala since the town was ceded to the Soviets in 1944, a crowd estimated at 
38,000 milled in front of the makeshift stage that had recently been erected 
jointly by workers from both towns -- and the spirit was strong. 
</P>
<P>
Until World War II, Sortavala, a vibrant, attractive city, was the site of an 
annual summer song festival. After 1944, when 400,000 Finns fled to the other 
side of the frontier on two hours' notice, it became part of a 
restricted-access military zone. As though bisected by an East-West Continental 
Divide, Finland's gravitational pull went one way, and Soviet life flowed 
another. The Sortavala Song Festival was reestablished in the '50s by the 
people of Joensuu. 
</P>
<P>
The festival's ideological climax, the East-West encounter across the border, 
was the culmination of more than two years of negotiations. According to 
Joensuu's deputy mayor, Pirkko Kylanpaa, the obstacles were daunting. 
</P>
<P>
"The roads were bad. We had to arrange the logistics of crossing the border. 
There was no stage. There were also questions of food," she added. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of June 23, two trains carrying 1,600 passengers made the 
two-hour trip through boreal forests to Sortavala. For this day only, Moscow 
suspended the usual rigorous visa requirements, and Soviet officials who gave 
passports a perfunctory once-over were almost genial as the trains rolled 
across the frontier for the first time in 46 years. 
</P>
<P>
At the station, visitors had powerful impressions of the toll to a society that 
had kept the world at bay. Smiling and making every effort to play the part of 
gracious hosts, these were people taking their first, tentative steps towards 
openness. 
</P>
<P>
Attempts had been made to spruce up the environs of the station, but elsewhere, 
wooden structures that hadn't seen a coat of paint since the Finnish withdrawal 
lent a woebegone look. Russian visitors who stayed overnight were accommodated 
in a hospital and camp grounds -- this town of 22,000 has no hotel -- and the 
few souvenirs to be seen were sold by street vendors uncertain about how much 
to charge. 
</P>
<P>
More than just a varied musical program and other scheduled festivities, the 
three-hour concert presented an opportunity for townsfolk to mingle 
unrestrictedly with visitors from the West. As one Finnish radio journalist put 
it, "Glasnost for the Russians is like psychotherapy. Now they are enjoying 
talking, but soon they'll tire of it and want more. Nonetheless, I feel 
euphoric. Sortavala represents a reopening of possibilities."

<P>
The Massachusetts Legislature enacted the largest tax hike in state history, a 
$1.3-billion combination of income, sales and gasoline levies designed to 
revive the flagging "miracle" touted by Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in 1988. The 
measure was enacted on an 80-75 vote in the House before winning final approval 
in the Senate by a 20-16 margin. 
</P>
<P>
It heads to the desk of Dukakis, an ardent supporter who aides said may sign 
the measure during the weekend. The final votes, which came shortly before 4 
a.m. in Boston, ended a marathon session. Angry Republicans and tax hike 
opponents said supporters of the measure would face retribution at the polls. 
The measure could also be undone by a ballot initiative designed to roll back 
the more than $2 billion in higher taxes and fees approved since 1988, when 
Dukakis campaigned for the White House on his ability to balance 10 state 
budgets.

Turkish political leaders led a growing outcry against Saudi Arabia over the 
death of an estimated 1,426 Muslim pilgrims trampled or suffocated in a tunnel 
in Mecca while on a pilgrimage, or hajj, to Islam's holiest shrine. 
</P>
<P>
A Turkish survivor said escape routes from the tunnel were closed with wire and 
soldiers fled instead of aiding the 50,000 trapped and panic-stricken pilgrims. 
Turkey, with 550 dead and Indonesia with 122 bore the brunt of the loss. 
Malaysia, which lost 122 pilgrims, declared Monday a day of mourning.

Leading West German firms help to build an Iraqi weapons factory where a giant 
cannon was to be made, the Hamburg-based news magazine Der Spiegel said. 
</P>
<P>
The weekly said "confiscated documents" showed that the factory near Baghdad 
was designed to produce guns. Experts feared that it was also where a cannon 
with a barrel about 150 yards long and with a range of 600 miles was to be 
built. Britain and other West European countries have confiscated shipments 
suspected of being parts for an Iraqi supergun that could hit Israel.

Government troops have regained control of a port in northern Sri Lanka after a 
month of heavy fighting, including recent clashes that left 62 rebels dead, 
military officials said. Rebel fighters of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam 
had controlled the port town of Trincomalee, 190 miles northeast of Colombo, 
and other vital areas in northern and eastern provinces. In a related 
development, the government dissolved the provincial councils in the north and 
east of the country and announced that it will hold elections at an unspecified 
date to fill seats abandoned by members of the Indian-backed Eelam People's 
Revolutionary Liberation Front, who fled the country when Indian peacekeeping 
troops withdrew in March.

AT HOME: FARMLANDS GROW INTO 'BIG LITTLE CITY';

<P>
FULLERTON: ORANGE COUNTY'S SIXTH MOST POPULOUS TOWN IS HOME TO MANY CULTURAL, 
EDUCATIONAL AND RECREATIONAL ATTRACTIONS.

When a job transfer brought Bjorn Juslin to Orange County from Finland three 
years ago, he and his wife, Merja, could have settled just about anywhere in 
the county. But Fullerton stole their hearts. 
</P>
<P>
"The downtown reminded us of Europe, with its big sidewalks and shops. You can 
window-shop here. That is unusual in America," Merja said. 
</P>
<P>
The Juslins had rented houses in Fullerton and nearby Placentia before deciding 
to buy. They shopped for about three months as far south as Fountain Valley, 
but were drawn back to Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
An immaculate, 1,800-square-foot, four-bedroom home on Victoria Drive caught 
their eye, and with their condo in Finland sold, they bought it for $280,000 
last December. 
</P>
<P>
"We love it here. This neighborhood is very quiet. Our back yard faces Acacia 
Park and the children's school is at the other end of the block. They don't 
even have to cross the street," Merja said. 
</P>
<P>
"And all the neighbors came over to welcome us when we moved in, which was nice 
because we were used to Texas hospitality," said Bjorn, who was assigned to a 
Houston office of Ericcson Business Communications upon first arriving in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
With a population of 111,749, Fullerton is Orange County's sixth largest city. 
It is noted for its cultural attractions, being home to a civic light opera, 
symphony orchestra, two museums and eight commercial art galleries. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it is the hub of higher education in the county with five colleges: 
Cal State Fullerton; Western State University College of Law; Southern 
California College of Optometry; Fullerton College, and Pacific Christian 
College. 
</P>
<P>
Besides educational opportunities, these campuses offer cultural attractions, 
including an arboretum, art galleries, theater productions and sports events. 
</P>
<P>
For recreation, Fullerton offers 46 parks, 26 miles of equestrian trails, two 
man-made lakes stocked with fish, numerous youth sports teams and tennis, 
racquetball, golf and swimming facilities within its 22 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange (57) Freeway runs like an artery through the eastern side of 
Fullerton, and the Riverside (91) Freeway borders the city in on the south, 
making almost all of Orange County freeway close. 
</P>
<P>
Providing yet another form of transportation, Fullerton Municipal Airport is 
the 19th busiest general aviation airport in California and is home to about 
550 private planes. 
</P>
<P>
"Fullerton is really a self-contained city. If you want it, it's here. We're 
only five minutes from any major department store and we have an Amtrak station 
to take you into L.A. if you want to go," said Cozi Martinetto, manager of the 
Century 21 Achievers office in Fullerton and three-time homeowner in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Martinetto and her husband, Ray, came to Fullerton from Alhambra in 1979. "I've 
always liked the feeling of the city and a small community at the same time," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton was founded in 1887 by brothers George and Edward Amerige, who sold 
their Massachusetts grain business and headed west to invest in Southern 
California land. The region had begun to prosper as railroads brought people to 
the Southland, and the Ameriges bought 430 acres of what is now Fullerton for 
$68,000. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, the California Central Railroad, a subsidiary of Santa Fe, sought 
land for a right-of-way. George H. Fullerton, president of another Santa Fe 
subsidiary, Pacific Land and Improvement Co., purchased the land from the 
Ameriges on the condition that a town site be included with the railway plans. 
Fullerton agreed, the town was created and its grateful citizens named the city 
after him. 
</P>
<P>
Railroad construction workers came to the area with their families, creating a 
need for houses, stores, churches, banks and schools. 
</P>
<P>
But even before the town was established -- as early as the 1860s -- settlers 
came to what is now Fullerton. Hearing about Southern California's favorable 
weather and soil, people from Northern California and the eastern United States 
came to the area to farm. 
</P>
<P>
The Bastanchury, Nicolas, McDermott and Ford families were among the pioneer 
farmers of Fullerton who grew oranges and grain and raised sheep, hogs -- even 
ostriches. The family names live on in Fullerton, as city streets and schools 
have been named in their honor. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Fullerton is aptly described as a "big little city." Neither a bedroom 
community nor one dominated by industry or tourist attractions, Fullerton 
offers the American dream of friendly neighborhoods, a good school system, 
in-town entertainment and employment opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Crime is kept in check by the city's 150 police officers and 13,000 members of 
its Neighborhood Watch program, which was established in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
"Neighborhood Watch makes people more conscientious about securing their home. 
That really does make a difference," said Mona Dean, Neighborhood Watch 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, there were 155 fewer reported burglaries in Fullerton than in 1988 
-- an 11% decline -- according to statistics compiled by the California 
attorney general. Robbery and rape were also down, but aggravated assault, 
murder and motor vehicle theft rose slightly. 
</P>
<P>
For people taking their first steps into the housing market, it can be 
difficult, but not impossible in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have a lot of first-time buyers in Fullerton because of the prices," 
said Barbara Kerr, a broker with Re/Max realty in downtown Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Single-family home prices in Fullerton range from about $175,000 on the south 
side to $300,000 and up in the central and north sections of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Data compiled by the North Orange County Board of Realtors shows the median 
sale price of a single-family, detached home in Fullerton as $210,000 during 
the first five months of this year. Median sale price of condominiums during 
the same period was $136,900. 
</P>
<P>
More than half of Fullerton homes are single-family, owner-occupied, and only 
9% are condominiums. The remainder, about 36%, are apartments, Chamber of 
Commerce statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
"The lowest-priced house in Sunny Hills Estates is about $550,000," Kerr said. 
"The higher you go in the hills, the more expensive it gets. Homes in Green 
Acre, Valencia Mesa, Grandview, Richmond Knoll and the Rodeo Drive area are 
among the city's original most-sought-after properties. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of Asians from Cerritos and La Palma are moving into these areas. 
They're in love with the big trees and the big lots. Some are spending as much 
as $250,000 refurbishing and upgrading, and so I see that neighborhood rapidly 
becoming million-dollar property," Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
Alan and Jean Fitzwater say they were warned about real estate prices in 
Southern California before they moved to Fullerton on a job transfer from a 
small city near Ft. Walton Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"We came prepared to rent for a year because we were a little anxious about 
making a commitment so quickly just based on a weekend. But we found Fairway 
Village, and it just felt right," Jean Fitzwater said. "It was within our 
budget, so we bought. It was a quick decision, but a good one." 
</P>
<P>
Fairway Village is a gated community of townhomes located on Bastanchury Road 
between Harbor and Brea boulevards. Built by S&amp;S in the mid-1970s, the 
quiet complex is set off by green belts and large trees and features two 
swimming pools heated year-round, a spa and lighted tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
The Fitzwaters bought their 2,000-square-foot, three-bedroom, three-bath 
townhome for $180,000 in spring, 1986. They estimate that it would now sell for 
$320,000, "but it might have slipped a little, probably about 5% or 6%," Alan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Alan, an engineer with Northrop Aircraft Corp. in Pico Rivera, wanted to look 
for a home within 45 minutes driving time of his office.

"We knew we wanted to live in Orange County. I said right away that I wanted to 
be in a real community, and that's what this is. The people here are really 
open to new friends and we've enjoyed that," said Jean, who, as a docent of the 
Fullerton Museum Center, is an active member of the community. Avid tennis 
players, the Fitzwaters also belong to the Sunny Hills Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
"When we drove down the middle of town the first time, we just fell in love 
with it. Fullerton offers something for everyone," Jean Fitzwater said. But not 
all Fullerton townhomes are as pricey as those in Fairway Village. 
</P>
<P>
While selection and price range are limited because condominiums are relatively 
scarce in Fullerton, a few developments can be found with units selling in the 
low $100,000s. They include The American Classics on Beach Boulevard and 
Rosecrans Avenue; Park Ridge and Quail Ridge, on Associated Road; Casa del Amo, 
near State College and Yorba Linda boulevards, and several on Peckham Street, 
near the intersection of Orangethorpe Avenue and Magnolia Street. 
</P>
<P>
The Arbors condominium complex, on the east side of the Orange Freeway, has 
one-bedroom units selling in the high $80,000- to $90,000-range, Martinetto 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For an affordable single-family home, Doug and Adrienne Boughter looked in the 
southwest part of Fullerton. They bought their four-bedroom, 1,700-square-foot 
home on Lambert Drive for $180,000 last September. It is their second home; 
their first having been a 1,080-square-foot "fixer-upper" in Placentia that 
they bought for $71,000 in 1987. After investing untold man-hours, they sold it 
for $135,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We did real well," said Doug, who, at 31, has lived in Fullerton nearly all 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
His parents moved to Fullerton from northern Illinois in 1963 to escape the 
cold weather. Now, Doug and Adrienne are raising their three children only 
three blocks from his childhood home. The children attend Pacific Drive School, 
one of the city's 18 elementary schools and the same one their father went to. 
</P>
<P>
"The schools haven't changed one bit. Some of the same teachers are still 
there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An audio producer at Sony Corp., Boughter is a graduate of Berkeley College of 
Music in Boston, Mass., so he knows what it's like to live elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"But when (in Boston) you can only go outside three months out of the year to 
get a suntan -- and then when you do, the mosquitoes kill you -- you realize 
just how great a place this is," he said. As for drawbacks to living in 
Fullerton, Boughter cites problems common to almost every Orange County city: 
traffic and population density. "And I miss the orange trees. We used to hike 
through them when I was a kid." 
</P>
<P>
Time was when much of the city was blanketed with orange groves and grain 
fields. Even up to the late 1960s, areas that are now parking lots at Cal State 
Fullerton were orange-tree filled. Today, Fullerton is nearly built out. 
</P>
<P>
"Land is very difficult (for developers) to acquire now in Fullerton. And what 
is here is very expensive," said Michael Mastron, sales manager for Trider 
Corp., developer of the newest housing tract in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
Located off State College Boulevard, between Yorba Linda Boulevard and 
Bastanchury Road, Mendocino at Fullerton Hills is a tract of 16 new homes that 
opened last November. Three models were available, beginning at 1,900 square 
feet and $319,900, ranging to 2,300 square feet and $385,000. 
</P>
<P>
"A number of the people who bought in our tract were already Fullerton 
residents who moved from a different part of the city. It's as if people who 
live in Fullerton are addicted to Fullerton," Mastron quipped. 
</P>
<P>
Another new housing tract, this one by the J. M. Peters Co., is in the planning 
stages on a 42.8-acre parcel on the northeast corner of State College Boulevard 
and Bastanchury Road. 
</P>
<P>
The development is scheduled to contain 236 detached homes ranging from 2,766 
to 3,562 square feet. In addition, 124 attached housing units will be built, 
ranging from 1,019 to 2,100 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Although brand-new homes are rare in Fullerton, there is a good inventory of 
previously owned homes. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of Fullerton homes are owned by people who have lived in them for 30 or 
40 years, so they are ready for turnover. Some homes are 60 years old, but they 
have not gone down. Many are custom, on half-acre lots and they're still 
beautiful," Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
Outsiders, however, might never guess the city harbors such residential charms. 
Why? Because of the image conjured up by its name. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounds so . . . industrial," Kerr said. "I was living in Beverly Hills, and 
I didn't want to move here because of the name. I wanted something to sound 
like Mission Viejo or Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Even West Covina has a better name. Or Santa Fe Springs. Guess it goes to show 
you, you can't judge a book by its cover."

CONSUMER NOTEBOOK: NOW IS TIME TO REVIEW FIRE INSURANCE; 
</P>
<P>
PROTECTION: MANY VICTIMS OF RECENT FIRES DISCOVERED THAT THEIR POLICIES DID NOT 
KEEP UP WITH INCREASES IN PROPERTY VALUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
With the memory of devastating wildfires that destroyed almost 500 Southland 
houses late last month still fresh, this is a good time to review your existing 
homeowners insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the victims of the fires in Santa Barbara/Goleta, Glendale and Sleepy 
Hollow in San Bernardino County's Chino Hills are discovering that they are 
underinsured -- or even worse, that they have no hazard insurance at all. 
</P>
<P>
With double-digit annual percentage increases in home values common in many 
Southland areas in recent years, insurers emphasize the importance of 
homeowners reviewing their insurance coverage at least once a year, according 
to David H. Crocker of Western Insurance Information Service. 
</P>
<P>
While you're required by your lender to have hazard insurance, adequate hazard 
coverage is just as important even if the house is paid for, because you'll 
need insurance money to repair or replace it if the house is damaged by fire or 
a concrete transit-mix truck falls on it -- as actually happened recently in 
Studio City -- or other covered perils. 
</P>
<P>
If your insurer offers it, you might consider obtaining an inflation guard 
endorsement that automatically increases the amount of coverage annually under 
a homeowners policy as protection against inflation, he said. The charge varies 
with the company. 
</P>
<P>
Insurance coverage for the house, its contents and the homeowner's or tenant's 
liability to others are most commonly combined into a single package called a 
homeowners policy. 
</P>
<P>
The basic homeowners policy -- called HO-1 in industrywide terminology -- 
covers 11 specified perils, including fire, theft and vandalism. The broad-form 
policy -- designated HO-2 by the insurance industry -- covers these 11, plus 
six others. A renter's policy (HO-4) is similar to the HO-2 and is for people 
who rent an apartment or own a cooperative unit. 
</P>
<P>
An advantage of having a homeowners policy over separate polices for fire, 
theft and other perils is that a homeowners policy will pay any additional 
living expenses -- over and above normal expenditures -- should the 
policyholder be forced by fire or other cause to temporarily live elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
If, like many homeowners, you have personal property -- furs, cameras, jewelry, 
art objects -- that may be more valuable than the limits set under the personal 
property coverage of a homeowners or tenants policy, you might want to consider 
purchasing a personal articles "floater" as a separate policy or by endorsement 
to the homeowners policy, Crocker said. 
</P>
<P>
Floater refers to the portable nature of the articles insured and the fact that 
coverage applies wherever the articles are located at the time of the loss, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To receive full replacement payment for any partial loss or damage under a 
homeowners policy, Crocker said, the owner must insure the dwelling for at 
least 80% of its replacement value. To receive replacement for a total loss, 
you must insure for the full value of the structure or buy a replacement-cost 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The market value of a house in most cases is not a good basis for determining 
how much coverage to buy," Crocker said. "Meet with your insurance agent -- or 
a customer service representative in the case of a direct-writing company -- to 
determine what the replacement value is. It's important to remember that the 
building lot represents a great deal of the home's value and it will not be 
destroyed by a fire." 
</P>
<P>
Another reason that it is important to have sufficient insurance is that the 
amount of coverage on the house becomes the basis for determining what 
percentages of the coverage are automatically assigned to other structures on 
the property, for personal property and for additional living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Under most homeowner policies, detached garages and other outbuildings are 
covered for 10% of the amount of the coverage on the house; personal property 
for 50% and additional living expenses for 20%, Crocker said. Additional living 
expenses are limited to 10% of the amount of coverage under the HO-1 and HO-8 
(older home policy). 
</P>
<P>
To collect for personal property destroyed in a fire, you'll have to provide 
your company's claims adjuster with a record of all belongings. Western 
Insurance Information Service offers a free brochure entitled "Taking 
Inventory." Available from the nonprofit, non-lobbying group that serves 10 
Western states, the brochure is a room-by-room checklist with space to record 
the serial numbers of television sets, VCRs and stereos, as well as a listing 
of other property such as furniture and appliances. 
</P>
<P>
For a free copy of "Taking Inventory," contact Western at 3530 Wilshire Blvd., 
Suite 1465, Los Angeles, Calif. 90010. The toll-free telephone number is (800) 
397-1679). 
</P>
<P>
Besides completing the inventory and putting it in a safe place, Crocker 
recommends: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Keeping the sales receipts of all personal property you buy. Having the 
sales receipts will help the adjuster determine the value of your damaged or 
destroyed property. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Take color photos of your property or, if you have a camcorder, make 
videotapes of it. Open up the closets and photograph or videotape the clothing; 
go into your kitchen and make a photographic record of the pots and pans. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Engrave your property with a driver's license number. You can buy an 
electric engraving device from a well-stocked hardware store. Engraving your 
property makes it easier for police to identify it if it is recovered after a 
theft. Be sure to record the numbers in your inventory booklet or other form. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Keep all these records in a bank safe deposit box or a desk or locker at 
work. They won't do you any good if they're destroyed in the fire.

IT PAYS TO CHECK ARM INTEREST RATE CHANGES; 
</P>
<P>
OVERCHARGES: REPORT CITES THAT MANY BORROWERS HAVE BEEN PAYING TOO MUCH ON 
ADJUSTABLE AND OTHER LOANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A recent report that said borrowers may have been overcharged as much as $8 
billion on adjustable-rate mortgages and other types of loans has renewed calls 
from some experts that homeowners should pay closer attention to changes in 
their ARM's interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good time to pull out your original loan documents and double-check the 
lender's adjustments," said Robert Chamness, an official with the American Bar 
Assn. and partner in the San Francisco law firm of McKenna, Conner &amp; Cuneo. 
</P>
<P>
"You might be surprised at the results," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The need to double-check periodic changes to the rate on your ARM were renewed 
after the government acknowledged that it is investigating whether errors at 
some financial institutions resulted in billions of dollars in overcharges on 
mortgages and consumer loans over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the same taxpayers who've allegedly been ripped off might also wind 
up paying for part of the overcharges. 
</P>
<P>
That's because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures deposits at 
financial institutions, may have to make refunds to customers of failed banks 
and S&amp;Ls that the federal government has already taken over. 
</P>
<P>
The Resolution Trust Corp., which was formed last year to get rid of insolvent 
savings and loan associations, may face similar problems. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent letter to the chairman of the RTC, Senate Banking Committee 
Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) said the alleged overcharges are 
"troubling." 
</P>
<P>
"First, of course, I am concerned that consumers may have been significantly 
overcharged by numerous institutions," Riegle wrote. 
</P>
<P>
"Second, I am concerned that the RTC may face large liabilites as a result of 
the need to refund such overcharges." 
</P>
<P>
If you want to double-check your lender's periodic adjustments, you'll need to 
know which index is used to make the changes and what is the margin on your 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
You can get this information from your original loan papers or from the lender. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most popular indexes in the West and other parts of the country is 
the 11th District Cost of Fund Index, published monthly by the Federal Home 
Loan Bank of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The index is a composite figure that measures the borrowing costs of several 
big financial institutions. It is published regularly in The Times, the Wall 
Street Journal and many other newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
If you're like many borrowers, your original loan documents state that changes 
to your interest rate will be based on the most recent index rate that's 
available 30 days before your payment is adjusted. 
</P>
<P>
For example, let's say your loan will be adjusted on Aug. 1. Counting back 30 
days, you arrive at July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Since the cost of funds index is published at the end of each month, the most 
recent figure on July 1 was published at the end of June -- and it reflects the 
May rate. 
</P>
<P>
Once you've got the proper rate, don't forget to add on the margin that the 
lender charges on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
The margin is basically the lender's retail markup: If the index rate is 8.75 
and the margin is 2 1/2 points, your interest rate will be 11 1/4%. 
</P>
<P>
If all your checking indicates that the lender may have erred when it made its 
adjustment, call the institution's loan-servicing department and ask for an 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
A lender that has accidentally overcharged you can rectify the matter in a 
variety of ways. 
</P>
<P>
It might offer to apply the overage directly toward the outstanding balance of 
the loan, give you a credit for next month's payment or send you a check to 
reimburse you for the overcharge. 
</P>
<P>
"Most lenders are quite willing to correct their mistakes," said attorney 
Chamness, who'll soon take over a chairman of the Bar Assn's consumer 
financial-services committee. "But you've got to point those mistakes out 
before they can be remedied."

HANDYMAN Q&amp;A: HOW TO CLEAR DEPOSITS FROM NEW TOILET VALVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Popular Mechanics 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I had a Fluidmaster 400-A tank valve installed in my toilet recently, 
and have since noticed a gurgling sound coming from the toilet. It sounds as if 
the valve is stuck open, allowing water to run into the bowl. The water level 
in the bowl doesn't change. Any ideas as to what's happening? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: The condition may be the result of a sediment buildup. Often, sediment 
in the plumbing is loosened when the new valve is installed and is carried by 
the water stream into a Fluidmaster valve. 
</P>
<P>
To flush out the deposits, turn off the toilet's water supply. Unscrew the 
valve's cover by pushing down and turning counterclockwise. Hold an overturned 
cup above the valve and turn the water on again. Flush out the valve 
thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
Check that an angle adapter has been installed on the overflow pipe. Without 
it, water will be siphoned from the tank, down the pipe and into the bowl. 
Also, check that the flusher is properly aligned over the valve seat so water 
won't leak past it. 
</P>
<P>
If sediment continues to clog the valve, you may need an in-line water filter 
in the house water-supply line. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
May Need to Open Wall to Fix Pocket Door 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can I fix pocket sliding doors that came off the rail without cutting into 
the wall to gain access? The hangers and rollers either come loose, or the rail 
becomes loose due to screws falling off. 
</P>
<P>
A: You may be able to solve the problem by adjusting the hardware the door 
hangs from. If, however, there is a problem with the tracks inside the wall, it 
may be necessary to open one side of the wall for access. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
When Paint Blisters, Check Ventilation 
</P>
<P>
Q: Last spring, I scraped every speck of defective paint from the siding on our 
house, then primed and painted with a high-quality topcoat. By November, the 
new paint had blistered. My neighbor painted two years earlier and his house 
remains in pristine condition. Why? 
</P>
<P>
A: Cut open some of the paint blisters. If bare wood shows beneath, it's almost 
certain you have a moisture problem. Check the venting on your neighbor's house 
and compare it with your own. Does he have a stationary attic vent? Has he 
installed vents in his siding? Good venting allows moisture to pass to the 
outdoors from inside a house before it can penetrate the siding and lift the 
paint. As a further precaution, use paint on interior walls that is rated as a 
vapor barrier. Also, make sure caulking and flashing are sealing out leaks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Root of Sidewalk's Problem Is Tree 
</P>
<P>
Q: Whole sections of my concrete sidewalk have heaved because of tree roots. Do 
I have to tear out the old walk and pour new concrete? 
</P>
<P>
A: Pouring a new walk would solve your problems only temporarily. The real 
problem is the tree roots. Since your concrete is in good condition, it should 
be a relatively easy matter to pry up the sidewalk in sections. Use a pry bar 
to move slabs out of the way. Chop out the tree roots. You may need to dig the 
subgrade deeper if the level has shifted. Tamp the earth firmly. For good 
drainage, put in six inches of gravel. Then replace the slabs on the gravel 
bed.

TEEN DISCOVERS $277,670 IN BAG AND TURNS IT IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN O'SHAUGHNESSY and PHILIPP GOLLNER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The teen-ager was scared when he walked into the North Hollywood police station 
with a nylon gym bag stuffed with $277,670 that he had found in a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old from North Hollywood wasn't sure whether police would slap him 
on the back for his honesty or treat him as a criminal and interrogate him. 
</P>
<P>
The reaction of the police must have come as a surprise: "Wow, look at all the 
money!" they said. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified young man, whose family requested anonymity, found the money 
shortly after midnight Friday in a Sun Valley parking lot. More than 18 hours 
later, accompanied by his father and 19-year-old brother for moral support, he 
turned over the cash. 
</P>
<P>
Police suspect the money belonged to an unlucky drug dealer. "Is there really a 
legitimate owner? I hardly think so," Sgt. Christopher Vasquez said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Not equipped to count so much money -- there were denominations up to $100 
bills -- police sent the money to their headquarters downtown, where a 
mechanical money counter used by narcotics detectives was employed to count the 
loot. Vasquez said the cash would almost certainly be handed over to the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Asset Forfeiture Unit, which distributes 
confiscated drug assets to the department. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez did not rule out the possibility that the youngster might get all or 
some of the money back if authorities fail to link it to drug activity. But, he 
said, "If you really put two and two together, where do those amounts of money 
come from? Dope." 
</P>
<P>
The young man found the money near some bushes in the parking lot of Canyon 
Liquor &amp; Deli, police said. Store manager Frank Younan said he was unaware 
of the discovery because it occurred after his business had closed. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a surprise," he said Saturday, when told of the find. "I think he was 
an honest guy. Maybe he's too young." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez said the intersection where the money was stashed is not known for drug 
dealing, although there are areas nearby where dope dealers hang out. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez, who briefly talked to the youngster and his family after they brought 
the money to the police station Friday evening, described him as "an average 
looking kid: clean-cut. He seemed like a good kid -- conscientious." 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez said the family members were worried about what would happen to them 
when they showed up at the police station with $277,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
"The family was a little bit apprehensive," he said. "They wondered, 'Are the 
police going to believe us? We don't know. Are the police going to apprehend 
us? We don't know.' " 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez said the mother told police, "We didn't know what you were going to do. 
You guys were really nice. We were surprised." 
</P>
<P>
The police didn't seem to care that the money wasn't handed over immediately. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just as much of a novelty to us," Vasquez added. "We were thinking what 
would we have done." 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager's mother told police that her son still hadn't relaxed from the 
excitement. 
</P>
<P>
"The kid is a little spooked about this thing, wondering if people will be 
looking for him," Vasquez said.

7 SCOUTS, 2 ADULTS RESCUED AS BOAT SINKS OFF SANTA CATALINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN and BILL BILLITER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven Explorer Sea Scouts and two adults were rescued after the 72-foot ketch 
Mariner they were aboard began taking on water and quickly sank eight miles off 
Santa Catalina Island, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Lifeguard Lt. Paul McIlroy said four boys and three girls, 
ranging in age from 15 to 18, and two adults were rescued shortly after 7:30 
p.m. Friday after the crew aboard the Mariner broadcast a distress call. 
</P>
<P>
McIlroy said no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Their adult adviser, Robert Fagnant, came from a below-deck inspection about 
7:30 p.m. and calmly told Shawn Wehan, 15, that the sailboat was leaking badly 
and sinking. 
</P>
<P>
Wehan was trained in Sea Scout radio skills and Fagnant told him to put out a 
"Mayday call" for help and prepare to leave the rapidly sinking vessel. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have time to be scared," said Wehan, who was standing in the water 
that flooded the boat as he made the radio calls. "You can't panic in that kind 
of situation. And I knew what to do." 
</P>
<P>
Fagnant said the leak apparently was caused when the caulking that sealed the 
hull's wooden planks failed. He said the boat, built in the 1940s on the East 
Coast and originally used as an oyster fishing boat on Chesapeake Bay, received 
$9,000 worth of repairs and was overhauled only two months ago. The Mariner had 
been extensively water tested after the maintenance, and no problems were 
evident, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The boat was donated to the Sea Scouts for training cruises about nine years 
ago, Fagnant said. He estimated the value at about $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Scouts are a branch of the Boy Scouts of America designed to train boys 
and girls from ages 14 to 21 in seamanship and safety, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
Mickey Hunter, director of the Sea Scout base in Newport Beach, said the the 
Mariner, which is owned by the Boys Scouts' Orange County Council in Santa Ana, 
was headed from Dana Point for an overnight trip to Catalina.

JIM MURRAY: MARSHALL'S MET TALE IS A PIPP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I guess the most telling argument for the advisability of playing in pain is 
the Lou Gehrig story. Every schoolboy knows it. About when the New York Yankee 
first baseman, Wally Pipp, came down with a headache or a cold or some other 
minor infirmity and requested the day off from his chores at the stadium. 
Yankee Manager Miller Huggins put a young rookie in his place. Fellow named Lou 
Gehrig. Lou stayed there for 2,130 consecutive games or 14 seasons. Wally Pipp 
drifted out of the league and out of baseball. And his name became synonymous 
with a guy who got upstaged by an understudy and never got back in the cast. 
</P>
<P>
Players learned to play hurt. The name Wally Pipp went into the language, 
symbolizing guys who didn't have sense enough to say, "I feel fine, Skip," even 
if they had a fever of 104 and chest pains. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Lou Gehrig, herself, was later to claim there was really nothing seriously 
wrong with Wally Pipp that day except he wasn't hitting and thought the day off 
might do him some good. So, he went to the race track. 
</P>
<P>
I bring this up because another first baseman, Mike Marshall of the Mets, is 
probably beginning to get an idea what Wally Pipp felt like. 
</P>
<P>
No one has ever been able to figure Mike Marshall out. A manager looks at him 
and all he can see is a pennant -- 6-feet-5, power to all fields. He has 25 
home runs and 100 runs batted in written all over him. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers sure thought he was going to be their next super star. Right after 
they signed him, he batted .373 and hit 34 home runs and knocked in 137 runs at 
Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
You wouldn't call Mike Marshall smooth. He just kind of surrounded the ball in 
the field, and he kind of clanked up to the plate like something that might 
need oil. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a lot of people thought the Dodgers should have just handed him a mitt 
and the first baseman's job when he came up and then forgot about it. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Dodgers experimented with the Greg Brocks, Sid Breams, even Pedro 
Guerreros at first base. They tossed Mike Marshall out in right field, where he 
played creditably enough, but where he sometimes looked like a bear on roller 
skates. His throwing arm was strong, if adventurous. 
</P>
<P>
But the real trouble with Mike Marshall was that you just couldn't keep him in 
the lineup. He became Baseball's Fabulous Invalid. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't as if Mike had these nice, glamorous, real he-man injuries, things 
like a broken collarbone from crashing into a fence in pursuit of a line drive 
or a cracked rib from a fastball or a rotator cuff from a hard throw. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall got these hard-to-diagnose, mysterious ailments, un-findable and, in 
some cases, untreatable. Back spasms, neck sprains. 
</P>
<P>
Back spasms are usually something a player comes up with on nights Dwight 
Gooden is going to pitch. Marshall's were a little less predictable. He came up 
with one once in the fourth game of the World Series, no less. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was the time he took himself out of the lineup because of a -- a 
little fanfare, please, professor -- wart! 
</P>
<P>
Now, wait just a darned minute! said Baseball. Give me that again?! Did you say 
"wart?" 
</P>
<P>
Well, in Mike's case, it was a little bit more complicated than that. It 
usually is. After all the clubhouse jokes telling him to stop playing with 
frogs, it developed that the "wart" was symptomatic of a nerve disorder. He 
needed an operation. 
</P>
<P>
He needed an operation on his toes, too. Nerves had bunched up between the 
third and fourth toes of his left foot. While it was a very real injury, it 
didn't sound that serious. Guerrero, who had moved to third base to make room 
for Marshall in the outfield, wanted to fight him. His other teammates, while 
more polite, were no more friendly. Marshall sat alone on trips, not exactly 
shunned but not exactly courted, either. He kept to himself. He couldn't 
understand what the fuss was. 
</P>
<P>
He hit the disabled list five times in four years. He occasionally skipped 
games or took himself out of the lineup after an inning in pain. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers finally gave up. They packaged Marshall with Alejandro Pena and 
traded him to New York for Juan Samuel. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall was agreeable. A new environment, a new lineup -- and he wouldn't have 
to face Gooden -- ever. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it was the same old back. Marshall came up to the manager a 
couple of weeks ago. He was hurting. Perhaps, if they put someone else in for 
the night -- or until the pain went . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Mets put Dave Magadan, their all-purpose infielder, on first base that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
He's still there. The Mets have spurted toward first place. With the club 
heading into the All-Star break, Dave Magadan is hitting .364 (to Marshall's 
.241). He has three homers, seven doubles and three triples. But mostly, he has 
first base. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall can't understand it. "I have been doing my exercises at the gym 
religiously, working out and am in good shape. I've got to play," he said as he 
sat in the Mets' locker room the other afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
He has demanded the Mets trade him. "When you ask for a trade, they either have 
to give it to you or you become a free agent at the end of the season," 
Marshall said. "I have told them I want to be traded. But I don't understand 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Pipp could explain it to him. Magadan might be there till the next century.

WORLD CUP: WEST GERMANY'S MATTHAEUS WOULD HAVE TO SCORE THREE GOALS AGAINST 
ARGENTINA TODAY TO CATCH SICILIAN.

<P>
If West Germany's Lothar Matthaeus wants to finish as the World Cup's top 
goal-scorer, he will have to produce a hat trick today against Argentina in the 
championship match. 
</P>
<P>
Matthaeus comes into the 11 a.m. PDT match at Rome's Olympic Stadium with four 
goals, two fewer than Italy's Salvatore Schillaci. The odds are against 
Matthaeus succeeding. Only one other player in history -- England's Geoff Hurst 
in 1966 -- has scored three goals in a World Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
It was in Bari Saturday night that Schillaci might have made the scoring crown 
his own. The Sicilian striker's 84th-minute penalty kick not only gave Italy a 
2-1 victory over England and third place in the tournament, it also doubled the 
distance between him and Matthaeus. 
</P>
<P>
England's Gary Lineker, the 1986 World Cup scoring leader, came into the match 
with four goals but was held scoreless. England's only goal came on a header 
from David Platt in the 80th minute after Roberto Baggio had given Italy the 
lead 10 minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The match also marked the end of two international careers. England's coach, 
Bobby Robson, bowed out after eight years in charge of the national team, and 
goalkeeper Peter Shilton announced his retirement after two decades as 
England's No. 1 choice in the nets. 
</P>
<P>
In all, Shilton played 125 matches for England, a world record for 
international appearances. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew about this about three weeks ago when he came to see me in Cagliari," 
Robson said. "I thought it was a right and proper decision for him. He's going 
out at the pinnacle of his career, at the end of a fabulous World Cup for 
England and certainly for him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's proved again at the highest level that he's one of the greatest 
goalkeepers we've ever seen. For me, I have not seen a better goalkeeper in 
this tournament than Peter Shilton. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been one of the great nucleuses of the team during my reign. He's been a 
terrific inspiration to everybody, and I have nothing but respect and 
admiration for him. It's nice for me that he felt he should go at the same 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Robson will take over as coach of the Dutch club, PSV Eindhoven, this fall at a 
reported $350,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding his retirement, he said: "I'm very sorry. I'm very sad. I shall miss 
it a great deal. It's been my life for eight years."

Jimmy Connors finds it difficult to pick against Boris Becker, who will play 
Stefan Edberg in the men's singles final today at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
"I think right now he's playing the best he can play," Connors said. "He has 
stayed the course all year. And who knows how long he's going to play? I think 
he has to win here. This makes his whole year." 
</P>
<P>
Connors, who won the Wimbledon title in 1982, is missing his first All England 
Championship in 19 years and providing commentary for NBC. At 37, he has 
dropped to No. 66 in the rankings since he injured his wrist in February in 
Milan, Italy, his only match of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm past the point of being concerned about my ranking," said Connors, who 
reinjured the wrist last week when he hit a few balls on a grass court. 
</P>
<P>
Connors' injury will prevent his keeping a full schedule the rest of the year, 
but he still plans to play in the U.S. Open. Next year, Connors plans to play 
10 to 12 events, although he thinks the men's game no longer suits him. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a victim of goon tennis and a victim of the powerful, big rackets," 
Connors said. "Finesse is gone. It's a totally different game now. No longer 
will you see guys like (Ilie) Nastase or (John) McEnroe, who had feel and 
finesse. Those days are over." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Connors favors Becker, he is quick to point out that Edberg's 
chances cannot be overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
"He won't make things easy," Connors said. "He's been over here working on 
grass since he lost in the first round of the French Open, so I think he is 
kind of a man on a mission, too." 
</P>
<P>
Heeeeeeeere's Steve: It was probably the week's most embarrassing moment. The 
All England Club believes it has nothing if it does not have tradition, and one 
of the club's rules is that a member must sit in on postmatch interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Rhode of the All England Club accompanied Jim Grabb of Tucson to Grabb's 
first-round postmatch news conference. When it was over, Rhode made a brief 
statement: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm Jeremy Rhode, I'm sort of the new kid on the block. This is the first 
postmatch interview I have conducted, and I must say I hope all the young men I 
have in the future are as articulate as young Steve here." 
</P>
<P>
Soccer to me: Ivan Lendl has managed to avoid contracting World Cup fever. Here 
is Lendl's assessment of soccer: "It's like watching 90 minutes of people lying 
around holding their legs." 
</P>
<P>
Best line: From Martin Johnson in the Independent, writing about how Vitas 
Gerulaitis played in his loss to John Lloyd in the men's over-35 division. 
</P>
<P>
"Gerulaitis was so immobile at times that he was in danger of being reported to 
security as an unattended package." 
</P>
<P>
Best fine: Kevin Curren was docked $500 for breaking the copying machine in the 
referee's office. Curren kicked the machine, angry that his doubles match had 
been postponed because of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
But no, yes: Wimbledon's "Yes-I-have-no-bananas" Award goes to Jakob Hlasek of 
Switzerland, who offered this confused assessment of his game after losing to 
Lendl in the second round: "My whole game is OK, but my serve is gone and that 
is why my game is gone." 
</P>
<P>
Second-best line: From Andres Gomez of Ecuador, when asked whether he 
celebrated his French Open victory back home: "I just had one party. It lasted 
a week." 
</P>
<P>
More Gomez: Although he made a quick first-round exit from Wimbledon, Gomez was 
still excited about the reaction of his countrymen in Ecuador to his Grand Slam 
title in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez said hundreds of people stood on the runway to meet his plane at the 
airport in Guayaquil. 
</P>
<P>
"And then they put me in an army truck, and I got some people in it, like my 
brothers and my cousins, and we filled it up and then we just went around the 
city," Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
"And then you turn back your head and the line of cars just is three miles 
long, and you know that was probably the best moment I had in my life," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was good to be truly accepted, and that kind of receptionist is hard to 
forget." 
</P>
<P>
Receptionist? 
</P>
<P>
Travel plans: The German magazine Stern reported that Steffi Graf is 
considering leaving Bruhl, West Germany, to live permanently in Florida. Graf, 
21, has been troubled by West German press reports linking her father to a 
22-year-old topless model who claims that Peter Graf, 52, fathered her child. 
</P>
<P>
Coincidentally, Steffi Graf recently agreed to team with the German National 
Tourist Office to promote and encourage travel to West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Protest movement: During a rain delay at Wimbledon, Bud Collins, tennis 
columnist for the Boston Globe and a commentator for NBC, reminisced about his 
former job as tennis coach at Brandeis, where the late left-wing activist Abbie 
Hoffman once played on his team. 
</P>
<P>
What kind of player was Hoffman? 
</P>
<P>
"Conservative," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him to practice serving, but not in the New York Correctional 
Institute," Collins said. "I told him to dig in, but not to go underground."

While Stefan Edberg played his Wimbledon semifinal match, Boris Becker waited 
in the locker room. Becker said he didn't need to watch. 
</P>
<P>
"I know him blind," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
An Edberg-Becker final is a familiar sight on the grass of the All England 
Club's Centre Court, where they meet today to decide the men's singles 
championship of the world's biggest tennis tournament for the third consecutive 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, Edberg, a 24-year-old Swede, and Becker, a 22-year-old West German, 
are in a rut: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1988, Becker beat Ivan Lendl in the semifinals. Rained out on Sunday, 
Becker and Edberg played the final on Monday instead. Edberg won in four sets. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1989, Becker beat Lendl in the semifinals. Becker won the final in 
straight sets after shocking Edberg, 6-0, in the first. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1990, Edberg beat Lendl in the semifinals . . . 
</P>
<P>
And the Becker-Edberg final? They agreed there isn't much difference between 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we both know each other better than any other player, it's going to be 
who wakes up with the better frame of mind," Becker said. "It's not much about 
tennis." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg is 8-15 in his series against Becker, who has won three of their four 
matches on grass. When they've met in finals, Becker has won seven of nine 
times. 
</P>
<P>
But buoyed by his 6-1, 7-6 (7-2), 6-3 victory over Lendl, Edberg is confident 
he can duplicate his Wimbledon victory of two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I can play much better," Edberg said. "We've played here the 
last two years, and I feel the way I'm playing, I've got a good chance. It's 
really the one who's got the best day." 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Wimbledon will not be won by the player who wants to win it the 
most. Lendl's defeat marked the third consecutive semifinal ouster of 
Wimbledon's top-seeded player. Each time it has been Lendl, who this year was 
unlucky to have the third-seeded Edberg in his half of the draw. 
</P>
<P>
If Edberg had been dropped to the bottom half of the draw and replaced by the 
quarter of the draw headed by fourth-seeded John McEnroe, Lendl might have had 
a better chance. 
</P>
<P>
Lendl blasted both McEnroe and Becker to win the Queens Court tournament, but 
that was three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at it, he played really well in Queens and maybe he peaked a 
little bit too soon this year," Edberg said. "I thought, sooner or later, he 
was going to have a tough match like he had with me." 
</P>
<P>
Edberg's toughest match happens today. He is venturing out onto Becker's 
domain, the Centre Court, where Becker is 21-1, blemished only by Edberg in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
After eliminating another big server in the semifinals, 18-year-old Yugoslav 
Goran Ivanisevic, Becker said he has just one plan for today: "Keep cool." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it's probably good advice for both of them. But the way things have 
been going, they will probably be back for another hot rematch next year.

Rick Leach and Jim Pugh won their first Wimbledon doubles title Saturday, but 
they still aren't sure of playing in the Davis Cup matches against Austria. 
</P>
<P>
Leach, of Laguna Beach, and Pugh, of Rancho Palos Verdes, defeated South 
Africans Pieter Aldrich and Danie Visser, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-5), in 
the men's doubles final. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Davis Cup Captain Tom Gorman has not selected the team that will meet 
Austria in the semifinals Sept. 21-23 at Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hopeful, but Tom hasn't told us anything yet," Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Pugh: "I think something like this might help our chances." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Leach and Pugh lost in the final to Anders Jarryd and John 
Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
"We wrote it down to experience," Pugh said. "But this is huge. It's something 
we always wanted, a big title, and it kind of moves us up a notch. 
</P>
<P>
Said Leach: "It feels great to hold that trophy up." 
</P>
<P>
It was Leach's and Pugh's third Grand Slam doubles title. They won the 
Australian Open in 1988 and '89. THOMAS BONK

NEWSWIRE: WALTRIP HAS SURGERY AFTER CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Race car driver Darrell Waltrip underwent more than three hours of surgery on 
injuries sustained during practice for the Pepsi 400, in Daytona Beach, Fla., 
an orthopedic surgeon said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Waltrip suffered a concussion, a broken left elbow and his left leg was broken 
above the knee in a seven-car crash Friday at Daytona International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
The operation at Halifax Medical Center concluded early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Albert Gillespie said he attached a metal plate about 18 inches long to 
Waltrip's broken thigh bone. Numerous metal screws were used to attach the 
plate to the bone. 
</P>
<P>
Waltrip's elbow was placed in a splint. There are no plans to put a cast on 
Waltrip's leg, and he should be able to begin therapy Tuesday, Gillespie said. 
</P>
<P>
The race was to have been the 500th NASCAR Winston Cup event of Waltrip's 
career.

STATE PENSION FUND WANTS A ROLE ON BANKRUPTCY COMMITTEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRADLEY INMAN, BRADLEY INMAN is an Oakland writer specializing in California 
business issues. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Public Employees Retirement System has launched a drive to 
change federal law so that it and other government entities can serve on 
committees overseeing bankruptcy reorganization plans. 
</P>
<P>
CalPERS is owed $25 million by Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, which filed 
earlier this year for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 
</P>
<P>
After a frustrating legal scramble to recover its losses, the nation's largest 
public pension fund wants Congress to amend rules that prevent such "government 
units" from serving on Chapter 11 creditor committees. These oversight 
committees can have considerable sway in shaping bankruptcy reorganization 
plans and in trying to recover losses to creditors quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The $56-billion pension fund was recently denied a seat on the creditor 
committee that was formed to restructure Drexel. The parent firm of the 
high-flying brokerage filed for bankruptcy after the junk market collapsed and 
small investors retreated from the stock market. The parent's assets exceeded 
liabilities by more than $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
Institutions and individuals quickly lined up to rescue their investments. 
CalPERS, which is Drexel's fifth-largest creditor, got in line too. 
</P>
<P>
CalPERS had loaned Drexel $25 million secured by junk bonds. In 1986, when 
CalPERS made the investment, the rate on the bonds was 2% higher than other 
fixed-income investments that CalPERS held in its portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
"It was considered attractive for its quality," said DeWitt Bowman, CalPERS' 
chief investment officer told the state Senate Committee on Public Employment 
and Retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Although CalPERS can monitor the Drexel bankruptcy proceedings, it can't vote 
on matters related to the restructuring. In federal court in New York, Judge 
Howard Buschman was sympathetic to CalPERS' appeal to serve on the committee, 
but federal law prohibits it. 
</P>
<P>
Only "persons" with creditor claims against the bankrupt firm are entitled to 
serve on the committee, according to the bankruptcy code. "Persons" is defined 
as "individual, partnership and corporation but does not include governmental 
units." 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Congress amended the definition so that a limited number of federal 
agencies, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Small Business 
Administration, could serve on creditor committees. But public pension funds 
are still excluded, and a number of court cases challenging the law have failed 
to overturn it. 
</P>
<P>
No federal legislation has been introduced to change the law, but CalPERS is 
trying to persuade the California Legislature to carry its message to 
Washington. State lawmakers are considering a resolution that would urge 
Congress to move on legislation to permit agencies such as CalPERS to serve on 
bankruptcy committees. 
</P>
<P>
Representing more than 600,000 California public employees, CalPERS first 
became interested in changing the federal rules during litigation three years 
ago between Texaco and Pennzoil. In a takeover battle between the two oil 
giants, Texaco filed for bankruptcy and CalPERS was denied voting status on the 
creditor committee even though it was a major stockholder in Texaco. 
</P>
<P>
A recent legislative hearing on the resolution gave state legislators an 
opportunity to inquire about the soundness of CalPERS' investing in junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
The legislative committee learned that of the $11.3 billion CalPERS has 
invested in corporate and U.S. Treasury bonds, less than 16%, or $1.9 billion, 
is secured by company assets or by government guarantees. Moreover, CalPERS has 
a total of $500 million invested in high-yield junk bonds. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other states, the California Legislature has placed virtually no 
restrictions on CalPERS' investment decisions. Other than a requirement that 
part of its portfolio go into home mortgages, CalPERS can make "any investment 
authorized by law." 
</P>
<P>
Measured by rate of return, that flexibility has paid off. 
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, CalPERS has earned an average annual yield of 18.2%. 
Despite the Drexel fiasco, junk bonds yielded the pension fund a 30% annual 
rate of return since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Bowman won't even second-guess the decision to get involved with Drexel. "We 
believe it was an appropriate investment," he said. "If fixed-income 
investments are properly diversified, the return can far exceed the risk of an 
occasional default."

Sales Tax Probe Targets Swap-Meet Vendors 
</P>
<P>
With tax revenue in short supply this summer, the state Board of Equalization 
is moving outdoors to ferret out firms that avoid charging sales taxes. The 
board has launched an investigation of swap-meet vendors who ignore state 
requirements to obtain a Board of Equalization seller's permit and collect 
sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Prompted by legislation approved last year, investigators "will visit swap 
meets throughout California to verify that regular sellers have permits before 
selling merchandise," said board spokeswoman Delena Bratton. 
</P>
<P>
The board also plans to audit vendors to see if they are accurately reporting 
taxable sales. 
</P>
<P>
While there are no reliable estimates on swap-meet sales in the state, they 
"have become big business in California and unique here because of our 
weather," said Jay Swerdlow of the California Swap Meet Owners Assn. in Los 
Angeles. "Shopping outdoors has become the thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
The trade group welcomes the new law, according to Swerdlow, because it 
believes that a few vendors do ignore the sales tax regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of our sellers are store owners who know the rules and are here because 
they do better at a swap meet on the weekends than they do in their stores," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Swerdlow figures that results from the board's investigation will give the 
fledgling swap-meet industry more "respectability."

HEALTH CARE: THE MAIL-ORDER FIRM EXPECTS SALES OF ITS HUMAN SKELETONS, PLASTIC 
BODY PARTS AND CHARTS TO GROW 30% THIS YEAR.

<P>
Here resides one of the enduring pieces of evidence that the catalogue business 
can sell almost anything. 
</P>
<P>
Housed in a simple, red brick building, Anatomical Chart Co. has built a 
multimillion-dollar catalogue trade catering to doctors, lawyers and educators 
as well as to movie prop departments in need of human bones -- genuine and 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
"They want an arm and a leg," said sales representative Myrna Cohen with a 
smile after finishing a call with a customer. 
</P>
<P>
More than a million potential customers have received the company's 
spring/summer anatomical products catalogue that boasts on the cover "The 
World's Only Source of Real Bone Skeletons and Skulls." 
</P>
<P>
"We used to be able to buy (a skeleton) for $200 to $300 and sell it for $400," 
said Julia Stock, vice president of sales. Today, however, a museum-quality, 
natural bone, adult human skeleton -- equipped with its own tripod and zippered 
dust cover -- will set a customer back $1,995. 
</P>
<P>
There are no restrictions on who can buy human bones. Most customers are 
medical schools or doctors who require the real thing. Many specialists believe 
that studying genuine human anatomy is the most valuable thing a student can do 
to learn to recognize the effects of disease and malformations of the body. 
</P>
<P>
Real human specimens used to be easy to come by through sources in India until 
its government banned all exportation of human remains five years ago. "There 
were rumors of killing people for their bones," said Marshall Cordell, 
president of Anatomical Chart, although he contends that the ban was a moral 
decision more than a response to such crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The company claims to have two new sources for human remains. When the Oral 
Roberts medical school closed its doors in May, Cordell bought all of its human 
bones. The other source is secret. Stock insists that it's all legal, but her 
lips are sealed about the cache to keep the company's monopoly on the genuine 
bone market. 
</P>
<P>
For most customers, anatomically correct plastic replicas of virtually 
everything from "The World's Best Life-Size Plastic Human Skeleton" (slashed 
from $379.95 to $299.95) to the "Bisexual Muscular Model with Internal Organs," 
complete with lifelike vessels, nerves and internal organs, do just fine. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 25,000-square-foot warehouse, the shelves bulge with artificial 
femurs, orbiting eyes and human brains that can be disassembled. Lifelike arms 
and legs dangle from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
There are also "key rings" from which dangle miniature body parts from head to 
toe and most everything in between. These are particular favorites among 
doctors, Stock said. Chiropractors buy miniature spines to use as promotional 
items, and dentists stock up on the $2.50 unbreakable elephantine molars. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of this is really serious," said Cordell, who passes out business cards 
attached to key rings that sport a small plastic heart. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said doctors are spending more than ever on models because patients are 
more interested in their bodies. "They want to see exactly what the problem 
is." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys, particularly personal-injury lawyers, are also increasingly turning 
to the company for visual aids to use in court. And parents are buying 
"Anatoflash Cards" and body puzzles for their children. 
</P>
<P>
But the heart of the business is its charts. Beginning in the 1940s, Peter 
Bachin drew five incredibly detailed anatomical pictures and peddled them to 
doctors and educators. Cordell, who picked up extra cash filling orders for the 
company while he was in college, eventually bought the rights to the charts. 
</P>
<P>
Cordell has led the company through an expansion that has made it the 
self-described largest distributor of health-related educational materials in 
the country. The privately held company is projecting 30% growth and is 
expecting to reach $9 million in sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
Armed with the marketing numbers that show an increase in sales around the 
gift-giving holidays and a surge in model skeleton rentals during the Halloween 
season, Cordell is eyeing high-traffic areas for retail outlets.

PERSONAL FINANCE: AT&amp;T'S NO-FEE CREDIT CARD ISN'T FOR EVERYONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since its unveiling last March, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's new 
Universal credit card has taken the world of plastic by storm. Lured by 
AT&amp;T's offer to waive the annual fee for life under certain conditions and 
to give a 10% discount on long-distance calls, more than 1 million people have 
reached out and opened accounts on this Visa card. That's far more sign-ups 
than expected and a record in the bank credit card industry. 
</P>
<P>
Worried bank card competitors, such as Citicorp and BankAmerica, have responded 
by requesting regulatory investigations of AT&amp;T's practices or by 
announcing card enhancements of their own. 
</P>
<P>
But is the AT&amp;T card a good deal? 
</P>
<P>
It depends. Although the free annual fee is attractive for people who pay off 
their balances each month, the card's other features are not particularly 
attractive or unique. In any event, the process for evaluating the card -- 
looking beyond the hype at its real costs and features -- is something you 
should use to assess all card offerings. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer experts say three elements are primary when evaluating a card: annual 
fee, interest rate and grace period. Other frills -- such as buyer protection 
plans, travel accident insurance, collision damage waivers for car rentals and 
so on -- are secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the AT&amp;T card's main selling point is its annual fee waiver. It's 
available for life to all cardholders who join in 1990 and use the card at 
least once a year. 
</P>
<P>
If you're among the 35% or so of cardholders nationwide who typically pay off 
your account balances in full every month, that's a great feature. That in 
effect means you can use the card for free: no annual fee and no interest 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody's ever offered that," Spencer Nilson, publisher of the Nilson Report, a 
Santa Monica newsletter that follows the credit card industry, says of 
AT&amp;T's lifetime fee waiver. "We're recommending it as one of the 10 best 
cards in the nation, especially for anybody who pays within 30 days. . . . It's 
a better deal than (Sears Roebuck's) Discover card or American Express." 
</P>
<P>
But if you keep a balance and carry it forward every month -- thus incurring 
interest charges -- the AT&amp;T card is not that much better than many 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
The card charges a variable interest rate set at 8.9 percentage points above 
the prevailing bank prime lending rate. With the prime currently at 10%, the 
card is set at 18.9% for now. While that's slightly below the 19.2% average 
charged by the nation's 10 largest card issuers, it's slightly higher than the 
national average of 18.4% among all card issuers. 
</P>
<P>
Also, if you have a good credit history, you might be able to get a Visa or 
MasterCard charging less than 18% from several institutions nationwide that 
also don't charge annual fees, says Robert B. McKinley, publisher and editor of 
RAM Research's Bankcard Update, a Frederick, Md., newsletter that tracks card 
rates. Some of these institutions are pickier about who they will grant credit 
but are worth a try, he says. 
</P>
<P>
As examples of better deals, McKinley cites two institutions. One, USAA Federal 
Savings, (800) 922-9092, based in San Antonio, but issuing its cards out of 
Tulsa, Okla., offers a 14.76% rate on a no-annual-fee card. Abbott Bank, (800) 
999-6977, in Alliance, Neb., charges 16.2% with no annual fee. 
</P>
<P>
"Either one of those is available to anyone nationwide; they're really good 
deals," McKinley says. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, he says, the AT&amp;T card has no cap to limit how high its rate 
will go. So if the prime rate shoots sky high, so will the rate on the AT&amp;T 
card, he says. 
</P>
<P>
The AT&amp;T card "is a good deal for those who pay their card balances off in 
full . . . but for the 65% who carry a balance month to month, clearly a better 
deal can be had elsewhere," says Elgie Holstein, executive director of Bankcard 
Holders of America, a consumer group in Herndon, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Another drawback of the AT&amp;T card is its cash advance fee, McKinley says. 
It charges 2% or $5, whichever is greater, on all cash advances obtained at 
financial institutions. Advances at automated teller machines will cost either 
2% or $1, whichever is greater. But T's card sets no limit on the fees, unlike 
most other cards, McKinley says. 
</P>
<P>
What about other benefits? 
</P>
<P>
The 10% discount on all long-distance calling-card calls is an attraction, but 
few consumers use their calling cards often enough to take full advantage of 
that, McKinley says. And this feature isn't unique. Last week, Citicorp 
announced that users of its Visa card could get discounts of up to 22% on 
long-distance calls through AT&amp;T rival MCI Communications. Within the next 
two years, most or all credit cards are expected to offer discounts on 
long-distance calls, McKinley says. 
</P>
<P>
AT&amp;T's card also offers buyer protection insurance, which will replace 
items purchased with the card that are lost, damaged, broken or stolen within 
90 days of purchase. But buyer protection is being offered on most premium 
"gold" cards, some standard Visa and MasterCards and, now, a growing number of 
checking accounts. 
</P>
<P>
Ditto for such other AT&amp;T card benefits as extended warranties, collision 
damage waiver insurance and travel accident coverage. Other cards may offer 
better terms, McKinley says. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson of all this: When shopping for a card, look at its costs carefully 
and don't be swayed by frills or marketing hype. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to be distracted by all the benefits and forget about the 
bottom line, which is the cost of a card," McKinley says.

LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONDS TO THE RISING TIDE OF VANISHING VEHICLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He had parked his new used car on the street in front of his Garden Grove 
apartment, reasoning that if he could see the car from his bedroom window it 
would be safer than in the parking lot where his mini-pickup truck had been 
stolen two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
But only nine days after buying his 3-year-old Nissan 200 SX, Duc Nguyen went 
out to go to work and the car was gone. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove police found it a day later, stripped and abandoned on a 
residential street three miles away. The engine was intact, but the two front 
fenders were missing. So was the hood, the grill and a rear window. The car's 
wheels and new tires were gone, replaced by an odd assortment of wheels and 
undersized spare tires. And there were gaping holes where the tail lights had 
been. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in the towing company impound yard, hands on his hips, Nguyen, a 
26-year-old computer operator, wasn't sure what he was going to do to help 
prevent his car from being stolen again. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe I should find somewhere else to park," he said, shaking his head. "I 
can't believe it. Why did they pick on me?" 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen, of course, is not alone -- not when he lives in a city that averages 
140 stolen cars a month -- 1,642 in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the number of vehicle thefts per 100,000 population, Garden Grove is 
among the top 100 cities under siege in what law enforcement officials call a 
national epidemic of vehicle thefts. Others included in that category are Buena 
Park, Santa Ana, Long Beach and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The surge in thefts has not only caused many owners to arm their cars and 
trucks with expensive alarm systems but has prompted law enforcement agencies, 
car manufacturers and insurance companies to work together in finding ways to 
stem the tide of vanishing vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
According to the National Automobile Theft Bureau, vehicle theft is the worst 
of the property crimes: It accounts for only 11% of the nation's property crime 
offenses, yet represents 48% of property crime costs: an estimated $7.3 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the number of stolen cars in the United States has 
increased 44% -- from 991,600 in 1978 to 1.4 million in 1988, the most recent 
year for which national figures are available from the National Automobile 
Theft Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, car-crazy California leads the pack with 295,789 stolen 
vehicles in 1989, a 10.7% increase over the previous year, according to the 
California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, when it comes to having a car, truck, van or motorcycle stolen, Duc 
Nguyen lives in the heart of the vehicle theft capital of the nation: Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Of California's 58 counties, Los Angeles is No. 1 with 129,275 stolen vehicles 
in 1989. No. 2 is San Diego County with 41,756 and Orange County is No. 3 with 
19,223. 
</P>
<P>
But there's no solace in statistics for a motorist who walks out to his 
driveway in the morning to go to work, or who returns to the mall parking lot 
after shopping, only to find his car has been stolen. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the increasing vehicle theft rate, many law enforcement agencies 
are beefing up their investigative units, expanding public awareness and 
meeting with car manufacturers to discuss ways to improve vehicle lock and 
ignition systems. 
</P>
<P>
"Heretofore, vehicle theft was something given a low priority, mainly in how it 
is categorized: as a victimless crime and as a property crime," said Sgt. 
Michael Williams of the California Highway Patrol's investigative services 
section. "And it wasn't given the attention, I'd say, by any segment of society 
as our more violent or emotional crimes: drugs, murder and robbery." 
</P>
<P>
But vehicle theft is not an insignificant crime, Williams said. And it is far 
from being victimless. "In fact," he said, "it probably has more of an impact 
than burglary." 
</P>
<P>
If your home is burglarized, he said, you may lose a TV, a VCR or a stereo. But 
when your car is stolen, "your work and social activities outside the home are 
altered dramatically. If you lose a vehicle, you can consider lost wages, lost 
time, inconveniences. Vehicles are an integral part of our lives, especially in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Various theories are presented for the surge in vehicle thefts in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
"No. 1, it was considered a low-risk, high-profit crime," said Williams, adding 
that a car thief was less likely to go to jail than a residential burglar. "And 
that was strictly because of California statutes. The law just did not specify 
that a vehicle thief had to go to jail if convicted." 
</P>
<P>
Enhanced penalties for residential burglaries in 1982 also caused some burglars 
to turn their attention to vehicles. Observed Terry Cramer, an auto theft 
investigator for the Orange County Sheriff's Department: "Some of the people 
I've interviewed have told me that they've gone to cars because there is not as 
much chance of getting caught and if they are caught, they're not going to get 
as stiff a sentence." 
</P>
<P>
Although first-time offenders still generally receive probation, a new state 
law went into effect in January that doubles the penalties for car thieves with 
prior convictions: up to six years in state prison, depending on the 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The new law also gives law enforcement the right, as with convicted drug 
dealers, to seize the assets of those profiting from vehicle theft. And, 
Williams said, it addresses juvenile offenders by requiring a probation officer 
to immediately review a case and, if there is sufficient evidence, to prosecute 
the juvenile rather than just give him probation. 
</P>
<P>
The popularity of Japanese vehicles has been another factor in the wave of car 
thefts. 
</P>
<P>
Said Cramer: "When we talk to the crooks when we catch them, they say Japanese 
cars are easier to take: They're easy to punch the ignitions. And their parts 
are readily salable. The parts are expensive, therefore there is a good market 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, nine of the top 10 stolen cars in California are Japanese. A South 
Korean-made 1988 Hyundai Excel leads the list, followed by nine different 
models of Toyotas. 
</P>
<P>
"Just in sheer numbers the Toyotas and Hyundais are popular and in sheer 
numbers they're going to be stolen," said Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Car thieves use a variety of methods to gain access to a vehicle, but they 
generally prefer a $5 dent puller, which can be purchased at any auto parts 
store. 
</P>
<P>
The device, which resembles an oversized screwdriver, can be used to pull out a 
door lock by attaching a screw on the end and sticking it into the lock 
mechanism. The same can be done with the ignition switch. Once the ignition is 
removed, a thief merely sticks a screwdriver or a tapered key into the ignition 
cavity to start the car. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators say an experienced car thief can break into a vehicle, pull out 
the ignition and drive away in about 30 seconds. "That's quicker than most 
people get in with their car keys," said Williams. 
</P>
<P>
If a car is stolen, however, the odds are good it will turn up. 
</P>
<P>
According to the CHP, 91% of the vehicles stolen in California were recovered 
in 1989. The bad news is about half had been stripped. That means everything 
from just a missing radio or seats to an entire body strip, including doors, 
fenders, tires, engine and transmission. 
</P>
<P>
"Toyota interiors are a real big item because they're very expensive to 
replace," said officer Bill Sharff of the CHP's investigative services section. 
</P>
<P>
The interior of a Toyota Supra, for example -- everything from the headliner to 
door panels -- will cost more than $8,000 to replace new at a dealership, 
Sharff said. But replacement parts may not be immediately available from the 
dealer and, to save money, insurance companies typically replace the missing 
items with less-expensive used parts. Sharff said used parts can be purchased 
for about half the price from a wrecking yard or parts shop, which may 
knowingly or unknowingly be selling stolen parts. 
</P>
<P>
As a crime, he said, vehicle theft "is kind of self-perpetuating." 
</P>
<P>
Sharff estimated that at least 25% of stolen cars are taken by organized theft 
rings, which can range from a group to an individual who steals cars and knows 
someone who is good at cutting them up or who has access to black-market 
wholesalers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of groups of individuals who have been stealing cars for years 
-- it's all they do for a living," said Sgt. Bill Lovold of the Los Angeles 
Police Department's auto theft detail. "With the drug situation, these 
individuals know they can steal a car and take the parts and get money for 
cocaine. It's very simple." 
</P>
<P>
To help turn the tide, many police departments are strengthening their auto 
theft investigation units. The Santa Ana Police Department, for example, has 
seven full-time auto theft investigators, with two whose sole job is to be on 
the street looking for stolen vehicles (4,411 in 1989 compared to 1,666 in 
1983). 
</P>
<P>
Other departments such as Huntington Beach and San Clemente are following the 
lead of New York City and San Diego and initiating CAT (Combat Auto Theft) 
programs in their cities. 
</P>
<P>
Participants in the program authorize police to stop their vehicles if they are 
spotted on the road between 1 and 5 a.m. Car owners are given a sticker for 
their rear windows as a signal to patrol officers that the vehicle should not 
normally be operating during those hours. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, car manufacturers have been meeting with vehicle theft 
investigators to discuss what they can do to lessen vehicles thefts. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, for example, a design team from Toyota in Japan met with auto theft 
investigators in Orange County to get a firsthand look at a problem that is 
virtually non-existent in Japan, where motorists regularly leave their car 
windows open and even leave the keys in the ignition without fear. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Adams, senior product engineer for Toyota Motor Sales USA, said Toyota has 
sent two major design teams to meet with auto-theft investigators in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"We've taken a lot of measures to improve the theft resistance of our specific 
products," he said. 
</P>
<P>
One result is improved door and ignition locks, which have been included on 
each model as it undergoes a design change. The locks, Adams said, "are more 
pick-resistant and harder to slide hammer, a process in which (thieves) slide 
them out of the car." 
</P>
<P>
Toyota also has begun using hardened steel on the face plate of the ignition 
lock cylinder. "This precludes them from easily screwing screws in there (to 
remove it) and because it is tough it is more difficult to pull out." The 
serrated cylinder also will break off in the ignition lock and will not allow a 
thief to start the car with a screwdriver, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Toyota also began installing anti-theft radios last year on its pickup truck 
and various car models. The owner punches in his own security code and if the 
radio is removed it must be reprogrammed with the same code in order to 
operate. 
</P>
<P>
General Motors, which met with law enforcement representatives from about 100 
major cities around the county in April to discuss auto theft, has made similar 
strides. 
</P>
<P>
Already in place on 11 GM car lines is a theft-deterrent pass-key system in 
which the car's electronic system must read a special code contained in a 
resister pellet embedded on the ignition key. Without a key bearing the correct 
code, the car's fuel system will shut down for two minutes before another 
attempt can be made to start the car. And, said a spokeswoman, "it'll happen as 
many times as you try to start the car improperly." 
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary theft data on Firebirds and Camaros, the spokeswoman 
said, there has been about a two-thirds reduction in the theft rates of those 
vehicles. By the 1995 model year the system is expected to be on almost all GM 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
But help is also coming from other quarters as well. 
</P>
<P>
Later this month, a Los Angeles-based company called LoJack is expected to 
implement its high-tech solution to the problem of tracing stolen vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Under the system, a homing device about the size of a chalkboard eraser is 
installed in a hidden location on the vehicle. When the owner reports his car 
stolen to the police, the car's homing device is activated. The device will 
then begin transmitting a signal to police vehicles armed with mobile tracking 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-seven police agencies throughout Los Angeles county, including the Los 
Angeles Police Department, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department and the CHP, 
have agreed to participate in the system. The company also has begun making 
presentations to Orange County law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The homing devices, which will be available primarily through new car 
dealerships, will cost about $600 to buy and have installed. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50,000 of the units already have been sold in Massachusetts where, 
LoJack officials said, more than 1,000 stolen vehicles equipped with the homing 
device have been tracked down. Florida, New Jersey and Michigan also have 
launched the system. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles-based International Teletrac Systems, which expects to launch its 
stolen vehicle locater service by the end of the year, claims to go LoJack one 
better. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of waiting for the owner to discover that his vehicle has been stolen, 
a hidden Teletrac radio location unit on the vehicle will be activated as soon 
as the car is moved unlawfully. Within two seconds, the vehicle's location will 
appear on a computerized map at Teletrac headquarters. The company will notify 
the police which, company officials say, will have similar software. 
</P>
<P>
The cost to buy and install the Teletrac unit will be about $500, with a $10 
monthly service charge. (The LoJack system does not require a service charge.) 
</P>
<P>
The CHP's Sharff views such technology as "a milestone." 
</P>
<P>
But whether the system will be the answer to the car theft problem, Sharff is 
not sure "because as soon as we develop that technique there will be thieves 
out there to find ways to circumvent it. But it's certainly going to help."

<P>
After his tell-tale wacka-wacka-wacka-wacka had burned white-hot on the totally 
awesome trend meter, remember what it sounded like when Pac-Man died -- that 
melting bleat as the trendy chomper disappeared into nowhere? 
</P>
<P>
Pac-Man once was so ubiquitous that then-President Ronald Reagan could pretend 
not to know what it was. But after being told it was "a round thing that 
gobbles up money," he could get reporters to guffaw just by quipping, "I 
thought that was Tip O'Neill." This was a craze composed of more than mere 
blips on a video screen: It was Jerry Buckner and Gary Garcia taking their song 
"Pac-Man Fever" to the Top Five. It was Chef Boy-ar-Dee adding Pac-Man 
characters to a ready-to-eat pasta meal. It was breakfast cereal, T-shirts, a 
Hanna-Barbera cartoon show and children's chewable vitamins. 
</P>
<P>
It was a platoon of opinion writers employing the vision of Pac-Man to describe 
their views on domestic spending, on Wall Street warfare, on the mysteries of 
sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
It was a seemingly universal whine: Mommy, please just one more quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, suddenly, it was silent. Dead. Gone. 
</P>
<P>
Can it really be roughly a decade since the little yellow blob and his 
bow-headed companion, the even more-popular Ms. Pac-Man, reigned as the 
nation's omnipresent pop fad? 
</P>
<P>
So where do trends go to die, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
If Americans get good and sick of a fad -- whether it's a dusty Darth Vader 
belt buckle in a thrift store, an old music video or even a clunky blue Ms. 
Pac-Man machine at a Los Angeles taco stand -- what happens then? 
</P>
<P>
Well, these days, call it Instant Retro. 
</P>
<P>
The 1960s live again now, or at least they did last year; the 1970s are redux 
now. Brace yourself, trend-watchers: In Instant Retro, experts and observers 
agree, time folds over on itself and we no longer grapple with the idea of 
living century to century or even decade to decade. 
</P>
<P>
No, in Instant Retro, ideas and items once ubiquitous vanish, then -- zap! -- 
they're back, instantly reminiscent, quirkily ironic and bittersweet clever. 
</P>
<P>
Rise, fall, retro. 
</P>
<P>
Are we now really living trend to re-treaded trend? Can it be that something 
can be in again as soon as it is out, that everything just is? 
</P>
<P>
Listen, is that wacka-wacka-wacka-wacka part of a deeper lesson from the 
persistent little yellow guy? 
</P>
<P>
Game developers at Atari Games Corp. say they are encouraged about the success 
they've had with new versions of Pac-Man, introduced for different home video 
game systems, including Nintendo. 
</P>
<P>
They hope players will buy Pac-Man not just because they love it, prefer it or 
are darn good at playing it, but because they miss it. Remember it. Cherish it. 
"When we reintroduced Pac Man, it was an immediate hit," says Atari vice 
president Dennis Wood. "Internally, we didn't know whether or not it would be 
good as it was. It turned out to be . . . popular beyond our expectations. To 
date, it's still our most popular selling game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a type of game that had universal appeal to male and female," he adds. 
"Easy to play. Very few games are like that. It's like Monopoly. Fifteen or 20 
years from now, you'll see that game out there. It's a classic." 
</P>
<P>
It's Instant Retro. 
</P>
<P>
And not just for the new devices, either. It's for the old machines too, 
because trends hardly die. That Darth Vader belt buckle is oddly perfect for a 
night of dancing in one of the many clubs that specialize in remixed '70s disco 
hits, and, of course, there are Pac-Man machines left to satisfy those who, 
well, never let go. 
</P>
<P>
Fans play the old machines in their homes or in between rinse cycles at the 
self-service laundry and, now, on home video game systems. 
</P>
<P>
Estimating how many of the original Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man machines still 
exist and operate nationwide would be "an impossibility," said Sandy Bettelman 
of C. A. Robinson Co. distributors in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which sold thousands of the video games in the Los Angeles area in 
the early 1980s, now gets a few back and redistributes them -- some to people 
who want them in their homes for sentimental reasons and for entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
A Pac-Man video game in its original cabinet would go for about $200 today, he 
said, adding a "combination of fondness and cheapness" led him to put Ms. 
Pac-Man in his home game room, where he has a dozen "classic" arcade games. 
</P>
<P>
Classic? "It was such a big, unusual phenomenon," Bettelman says of Pac-Man. 
"When people visit us, that's always the first game they run to." 
</P>
<P>
Bally Manufacturing Corp., which sold about 250,000 Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man 
machines in the first part of the decade, reported peak revenues of $600 
million in 1982 from its amusement game business. But by 1987, revenue from the 
games had fallen to $24.3 million. And by 1988, Bally had sold the games 
division -- a founding tradition dating to the company's first pinball game in 
1931 -- to its chief competitor, WMS Industries, for $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, rights to Pac-Man returned to Namco, the Japanese corporation that 
had invented the little dude in the first place. It, in turn, has turned over 
the license for new home versions of Pac-Man to Atari. 
</P>
<P>
"We called it the video bust," said Valerie Cognevich, editor of Play Meter 
magazine, a trade journal for the amusement industry. "Actually, the (arcade 
game) industry is doing all right now; you just don't hear about it as much. 
Pac-Man was certainly the peak, and then a lot of people got out of the 
business after that." 
</P>
<P>
But now, like owning a stoic jukebox or psychedelic posters, people can buy the 
machines and Pac to the limit in a nostalgic corner of their own home. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Mendelson, a Los Angeles video game operator who supplies newer video 
games as well as older models to area arcades, bought a Ms. Pac-Man machine for 
his family to play. 
</P>
<P>
After rebuilding the cabinet to accommodate shorter players, the Mendelsons 
find themselves playing the game "once a day, at least." 
</P>
<P>
Once the craze died down (and the price of the arcade Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man 
came down from peak prices of $2,500), Mendelson decided to put one his home 
because "it's a great frustration-reliever. It was one the games we remember 
and always enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
"People who come by see it and instantly recognize it," he says. "For them, 
it's another chance to play something they may not have played for years. I 
guess it is nostalgic." 
</P>
<P>
Already? Is everything -- pop trends, technology and plain old junk -- just 
beginning to wrap together? Is there no longer an in or out? 
</P>
<P>
Richard Saul Wurman, author of "Information Anxiety," thinks it's all part of 
what he calls the "Age of Also," a time when trends and events no longer occur 
in a linear fashion, with one succeeding the next. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told we would have paper-less offices with the dawn of computers," he 
says. "Now we have offices with twice as much paper and computers. The fax 
machine was supposed to eliminate phone calls, but now we call someone to tell 
them we're sending them a fax, and they call us back to say they got the fax. 
</P>
<P>
"What used to happen," he adds, "is there would be one prevailing trend, like 
with music, and then something would replace it. Now we have all forms of music 
popular at once, with no leading edge. Television was supposed to mean that we 
would have fewer movies, but now we have more of both." 
</P>
<P>
Which is not necessarily a bad thing. 
</P>
<P>
Instant Retro in the Age of Also preserves pop culture for multidecade uses. 
"What has happened is in some ways quite wonderful," Wurman says, noting that 
today, people are exposed to a wider spectrum of trends and culture, 
particularly in music. "It gives us a more parallel view of the world." 
</P>
<P>
On the gold lame edge of what threatens to be a massive 1970s retro movement of 
music, clogs, sideburns and center-parted hairstyles, it may not be too soon to 
consider a resurgence of '80s fads. 
</P>
<P>
In these days of Instant Retro, nothing can re-arrive too early. Newly 
resuscitated video jockey Martha Quinn peddles classic videos ("classic" as in 
videos circa 1984) on MTV. Ralph Lauren prospers. The video disc lives. Rock 
stations still play songs by Boston, Queen, Styx and the Go-Go's. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, Pac-Man wacka-wackas on. 
</P>
<P>
It plays even in museums. "Hot Circuits," an exhibit of arcade video games 
dating to the 1970s at the American Museum of the Moving Image near Queens, 
N.Y., invites visitors to play "classic" games with five free tokens. 
</P>
<P>
Co-curator David Draigh says the idea for the 45-game exhibition developed from 
a desire to "have a retrospective, because looking back at video games, it was 
such a mania and all, what with all the public outcry against them at first, 
and now how they've settled into our lives." 
</P>
<P>
Draigh said that once a list was made of the most influential video games of 
the past two decades (Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man figuring prominently), exhibit 
staffers went on "kind of an archeological dig" to find old but still-working 
video games. The exhibit's success in New York will propel it this year to 10 
more American cities, including Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
In a world in which many people reminisce about "Star Wars," watch reruns of 
"Charlie's Angels" and prefer radio stations that mix "favorite songs from the 
yesterdays with the songs of today," what about the genuine art of preserving 
nostalgia? 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's part of the extraordinary self-consciousness of the age," says 
Ricardo Quinones, a Claremont-McKenna College humanities professor who has 
written of the relation of time to the cultural past. "Things today are dropped 
very quickly and we get on a historical treadmill. We reach back more quickly 
to recent objects to recapture them . . . we have decade mania." 
</P>
<P>
"Hypernostalgia," as Quinones calls it, is not new. Europeans, during the first 
part of the century, also were preoccupied with decades and faddish movements. 
</P>
<P>
"Memory is a throwaway now, and as we forget, so too (do) we have instant 
nostalgia," he says. "I think these fad things that seem to come back around 
faster represent our destiny to be a very self-conscious society . . . and as 
we become victims of larger historical amnesia, we get more into trends and 
reviving those trends. And, of course, we are all guilty of media events. I 
guess the motto of the story is save your skinny ties, and baseball cards, 
again and again." 
</P>
<P>
Leo Braudy, a USC English professor who also studies pop culture trends, thinks 
that as Americans near the end of the century, their nostalgia speeds up. 
</P>
<P>
"By 1995, we'll be remembering 1990," he says. "We have such short attention 
spans that you can't even predict the return of fashions any more." 
</P>
<P>
For some, Braudy said, "Pac-Man could symbolize the Reagan days . . . it was 
the metaphor for greed. Can we already be sort of ironic about it? I don't 
know." 
</P>
<P>
Since Instant Retro provides fads that never really go away, he adds, Americans 
comfortably can rely on favorite trends in an increasingly chaotic, 
something-new-every-day world: "Maybe there's something kind of cozy about 
playing a favorite video game. As the world moves forward, we can create our 
own little collages of things from the past." 
</P>
<P>
So then, here's a cozy, comforting Instant Retro collage: a swirly, dreamy 
roller disco party hosted by Lindsay Wagner as the Bionic Woman. Piped-in 
Olivia Newton John songs. Wide rainbow suspenders for all the guests, even E.T. 
</P>
<P>
An economics professor, dressed comfortably in an Izod shirt, is on hand to 
explain Reaganomics. The Sex Pistols have reunited. A hair salon offers 
feathery Farrah-dos, on the house. Little Ricky Schroeder plays with Slime. 
</P>
<P>
The Pac-Man tokens are free. 
</P>
<P>
Farther down a misty hallway decorated with Carter-Mondale posters, people line 
up for gasahol, for free Bicentennial merchandise, for seats at the Patty 
Hearst trial. 
</P>
<P>
Keep going down this hall and it might just feel cozier all the time. Look, 
there's Josie and the Pussycats, and George of the Jungle. A vast auditorium 
shows films like "American Graffiti" (vintage 1950s, retro from the 1970s), 
interspersed with recurring bits from the Laverne-and-Shirley-o-Rama (vintage 
1950s and '60s retro from the '70s and '80s. Weird!). 
</P>
<P>
Does this not seem nostalgic? That's the mystery of Instant Retro. 
</P>
<P>
If you're leaving, remember to check out the door prizes -- like a Scooby Doo 
lunch pail, a big Betamax player, a Radio Shack TRS-80 computer. 
</P>
<P>
If you're staying, wear plaid.

A POET'S LEGACY IS STORED IN FOLGER SHAKESPEARE LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
If William Shakespeare were to come back to life and resurface here, he would 
feel very much at home in the neoclassic white marble building across from the 
Library of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Shakespeare would be 426 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Nine large bas-reliefs by sculptor John Gregory depict scenes from 
Shakespeare's plays on the exterior of the imposing structure. In a nearby 
garden, carved on the base of Brenda Putnam's statue of Puck, is the line from 
"A Midsummer Night's Dream": "Lord, what fooles these mortals be!" 
</P>
<P>
Inside the building, the Folger Shakespeare Library, is the world's largest 
collection of plays and poetry by William Shakespeare, as well as America's 
pre-eminent collection of English-language publications from the 15th through 
18th centuries. Holdings include two-thirds of all known titles published in 
England or in English before 1640. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the library houses a virtual history of Shakespeare productions 
during the past four centuries, thanks to its vast collection of playbills, 
promptbooks, paintings, costumes, correspondence, critical reviews, 
manuscripts, books and films. 
</P>
<P>
Scholars throughout the world come here to do serious research on Shakespeare, 
his poetry, his plays, his times, the origins and influence of the Elizabethan 
Age, the Renaissance in general, and the literature, economics and politics of 
15th-through-18th-Century Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers pore over rare books and manuscripts dating from the 15th Century 
in the stunning Elizabethan Reading Room. Visitors with no connection to 
academia come to see the treasures on exhibit in the 130-foot-long Great Hall, 
with its oak-paneled walls and hand-carved Elizabethan doorways, a re-creation 
of a Tudor gallery. 
</P>
<P>
There are midday poetry readings. The Folger Consort, an Elizabethan music 
ensemble, performs frequently. There are seminars, symposiums and lectures 
year-round. 
</P>
<P>
Here, too, is a reproduction of a theater typical of Shakespeare's day, modeled 
after an inn with balconies. Artistic director Michael Kahn's 1990-91 season 
opens Sept. 11 in the Folger Shakespeare Theatre with "Richard III," starring 
Stacy Keach in the title role of the "murderous charmer who schemes and seduces 
his way to the English throne." 
</P>
<P>
The best flavor of the Elizabethan Age to be found anywhere in America is at 
the Folger Shakespeare Library. 
</P>
<P>
It was a lecture on Shakespeare by Ralph Waldo Emerson at Amherst College in 
1879 that triggered Henry Clay Folger's interest in the playwright. 
</P>
<P>
Folger was a descendant of Peter Folger, a Martha's Vineyard, Mass., 
schoolmaster who emigrated from England in 1635. Peter Folger's daughter, 
Abiah, was Benjamin Franklin's mother. 
</P>
<P>
After he graduated from Amherst (the same year he heard Emerson's lecture), 
Folger was hired as a clerk by Standard Oil Company of New York, where he rose 
through the ranks to become president. His wife, Emily Jordan, wrote a master's 
thesis at Vassar based on her study of various editions of Shakespeare's plays 
published from the 16th to 19th centuries. 
</P>
<P>
Both were hooked on the Bard for 60 years and devoted all of their spare time 
to collecting related material. That devotion culminated in their decision to 
build the library. 
</P>
<P>
Folger died two weeks after the cornerstone was laid. President Herbert Hoover 
dedicated the library on Shakespeare's birthday, April 23, in 1932. Folger's 
wife was involved in its financial support and operation until her death in 
1936.

The Folgers had no children. Their fortune was spent on the Shakespeare 
collection, the library and the endowment to operate it. The Folgers left the 
library in care of the trustees of Amherst College. Their ashes are in the 
Elizabethan Reading Room. 
</P>
<P>
"There are things here that scholars come from England to see because they 
cannot be found in Shakespeare's homeland," said Ann Greer, library public 
affairs coordinator, as she opened the 1568 personal Bible of Queen Elizabeth 
I, a volume bound in its original red velvet. 
</P>
<P>
She turned the pages of a 1502 Latin book that belonged to Henry VIII. As a 
student, he scrawled in large, bold hand: "Thys boke is myne. Prince Henry." 
Greer also showed a letter written by Queen Elizabeth to Henry IV of France in 
1595. 
</P>
<P>
Among the library's remarkable treasures are 79 copies of the First Folio 
edition of Shakespeare's plays, published in London in 1623 by two of his 
fellow actors, John Heminges and Henry Condell, seven years after the 
playwright's death. The British Library has the next largest collection of the 
First Folio -- five copies. There were 1,000 printed; 240 are known to exist. 
</P>
<P>
The title page of the First Folio reads: "Mr. William Shakespeares Comedies, 
Histories &amp; Tragedies" and contains the best-known portrait of the author, 
one of only two authentic likenesses known to exist. 
</P>
<P>
"What a privilege to be allowed in these hallowed rooms, to be able to have 
access to the rare books and manuscripts and to use them for research," said 
Bernice Kliman, 56, who teaches Shakespeare at Nassau Community College on Long 
Island. She has spent a month every summer since 1976 in the library working on 
her own books. 
</P>
<P>
Her book "Hamlet -- Film, TV and Audio Performances" was researched here. She 
is now doing a history of 18th-Century Shakespearean actors. "I thumb through 
pages of books written in the 1700s full of descriptions of actors, their 
acting traits, face, eyes, voice, expressions, detailed accounts of their 
performances," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
At another table sat Peter Blayney, 46, of London, a scholar-in-residence who 
has been working for six years on a book about the book trade in London from 
1590 to 1610. "I'm here every day. My work is supported by a grant from the 
National Endowment for the Humanities. This project is likely to take me 20 
years," Blayney said. 
</P>
<P>
"No one has ever covered this before. I'm reviewing 8,500 books published in 
London during those two decades. Yes, I'm obsessed with the subject. You have 
to be slightly unhinged to get involved in something of this magnitude," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Two other scholars met here seven years ago while doing research and decided to 
collaborate on a book about Shakespeare's Caliban, a character in his plays who 
is the symbol of the exploited native. They have since married -- Alden Vaughn, 
a professor of history at Columbia, and his wife, Virginia, a professor of 
English at Clark University. The book is to be published next year. 
</P>
<P>
This summer -- from July 23 through Aug. 20 -- for the first time, 25 American 
and 15 British secondary-school Shakespeare teachers will spend two weeks at 
Stratford-on-Avon and two weeks at the Folger to study with some of the 
best-known Shakespeare scholars, actors and directors in an program put on by 
the Folger and the Royal Shakespeare Company. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first collaboration between the two, considered the two most 
significant Shakespeare repositories in the world," said Peggy O'Brien, 42, 
education coordinator for the Folger. The American teachers are being funded by 
a $200,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. 
</P>
<P>
She explained that each summer the Folger sponsors an institute for 
secondary-school teachers of Shakespeare who come to the library. "We generally 
have 30 to 40 teachers selected from 700 who apply. It is one of many 
educational programs sponsored by the Folger. There is also an annual 
Shakespeare Festival for Washington-area fourth- to 12th-graders. 
</P>
<P>
"We send 14 trainees to 187 schools in 12 states to teach more than 19,000 
students each year all about Shakespeare. We're doing more with Shakespeare 
than anybody. We turn the lights on with kids. The best way to teach them 
Shakespeare is to have them get up on their feet and enact the roles in his 
plays." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien said, "There is something about this guy that captures them, no matter 
who or where they are -- in rural schools, inner-city or affluent schools. 
Shakespeare can really make a difference to many young students." 
</P>
<P>
Werner Gundersheimer, 53, an Italian Renaissance scholar and author of six 
books, has been director of the Folger since 1984. He did his undergraduate 
work at Amherst and his graduate work at Harvard. He previously taught at the 
universities of Wisconsin, Johns Hopkins, Pennsylvania and Tel Aviv, and at 
Swarthmore College. 
</P>
<P>
The library has a staff of 75 and operates on an annual budget of $4.4 million, 
with $250,000 spent each year on acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
"When the library opened 58 years ago, it was universally recognized as the 
world's pre-eminent repository of materials concerning Shakespeare. Today, it 
is also one of the world's leading centers for research in the continental 
Renaissance and early modern European literature and history," said 
Gundersheimer, who added: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure William Shakespeare and Emily and Henry Clay Folger would be pleased 
and proud of this national treasure that carries their names, the Folger 
Shakespeare Library."

A VOICE THAT SPANS TWO WORLDS; 
</P>
<P>
CANTOR NATHAN LAM SERVES THE ANCIENT RITUALS OF JUDAISM AND THE DEMANDS OF POP 
MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He has prepared boys for bar mitzvahs, and Beatles for world tours. 
</P>
<P>
He has produced songs for God and the Go-Gos. 
</P>
<P>
He is Nathan Lam, 43, cantor at the Stephen S. Wise Temple in Bel-Air and vocal 
instructor for Lionel Ritchie, David Cassidy, David Coverdale, Barry Bostwick 
and John Davidson. His life is a nonstop shuttle between two worlds -- the 
ancient rituals of Judaism and the modern demands of popular music. 
</P>
<P>
"This is fun," Lam said after a half-hour sesson with actor Dean Jones. "I love 
expressing myself in the musical world. And when I'm at the pulpit, that's 
spiritual. It's sustenance, like eating." 
</P>
<P>
Lam didn't expect this extra dimension to his cantorial career. How to meet a 
Beatle wasn't taught in religion class. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not usually star-struck," said Lamb, who gave Ringo Starr six weeks of 
lessons in 1989 in preparation for his comeback tour, "but I kept thinking, 
'He's a Beatle.' And I'm teaching this guy how to sing 'Yellow Submarine'? I 
must have heard that album about 90,000 times." 
</P>
<P>
He expected the traditional life of a cantor: bar mitzvahs, weddings, funerals 
and Sabbath services, maybe an album or two of Jewish liturgy. 
</P>
<P>
And that's what happened until he officiated at a wedding in 1977. A woman 
heard his voice and asked if he taught singing lessons. "I told her to come to 
my office, and I'd give it a try," Lam said. "I had never given lessons 
before." 
</P>
<P>
Soon, the woman brought her husband, and word of Lam's talent quickly spread. 
At the same time, his fascination for voice technique grew. He bought books and 
listened to other performers. 
</P>
<P>
His first breakthrough with celebrities came when Barbara Anderson, who played 
Eve on the television series "Ironside" in the late 1960s and early 1970s, came 
in for a lesson. Anderson had lost her voice, and needed strengthening 
exercises to be ready for a speaking role in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" 
Anderson's voice gradually improved, and she reported her success to acting 
instructor Milton Katselas, who, in turn, passed the tip to his pupils. "I was 
soon inundated with calls," Lam said. 
</P>
<P>
His new life began. Soon he was instructing Burt Reynolds, who was about to 
star in "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas." Said Lam, "He's a better singer 
than people think." Next came Richard Harris, who was appearing in "Camelot." 
Harris hired Lam to arrive an hour before each show. 
</P>
<P>
For 13 weeks -- and 99 performances -- Lam came backstage, and made sure Harris 
was ready to sing. "I never missed a performance, even when my daughter was 
born." he said. He was almost late once when he was stopped by Barbra 
Streisand, who required his immediate expert opinion. He told her he would 
squeeze her in later that week between visits to Reynolds and Rod Stewart. "She 
was working on 'Yentl' then, and wanted to know about the authenticity of 
certain Jewish music." 
</P>
<P>
He also gained automatic entry into rock 'n' roll circles usually uncharted by 
men of clergy. Lam produced the vocals for the Go-Go's' third album, "Talk 
Show," and began teaching Stewart, David Coverdale of Whitesnake, and members 
of Poison. Sometimes he'd recognize the absurdity of his double life. 
</P>
<P>
"What am I doing here?" he wondered while on the Poison tour bus between 
Oklahoma City and Lexington several years ago. "It was 4 a.m., and I'm playing 
Trivial Pursuit with a rock 'n' roll band." 
</P>
<P>
His new life threatened to interfere with the old one. A congregation leader 
worried about Lam's commitment; with 2,850 families, Stephen S. Wise is one of 
the world's largest synagogues. "I told him that the job will get done." 
</P>
<P>
The congregation's governing board wanted Lam close by, granting him permission 
to hold voice lessons in his office. He didn't miss the point. 
</P>
<P>
"The synagogue comes first," Lam said, "and I make sure all my students know 
that. If there's any kind of emergency, I'll stop a lesson to do what I have to 
do." An emergency might mean final bar mitzvah lessons for a nervous 
13-year-old or officiating at a funeral. 
</P>
<P>
The synagogue is where he started. As an 8-year-old boy, he attended Temple 
Adat Ari El in North Hollywood every Sabbath service. One day, everything 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
"I stood there singing," he said, "and something touched my soul. I was 
smitten. Sometimes when I do services now, I'll go back to that sense of awe I 
had as an 8-year-old. It helps to inspire me to pray to another level. I have 
to find some way to inspire my congregation." 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't a natural. Cantor Allan Michelson, his first instructor, wasn't 
overly impressed with the early Lam sound. "The voice wasn't that good," 
Michelson said, "but when he became a teen-ager, I knew he'd become a cantor. 
He had passion, and he worked at it. He has a tremendous musical memory." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout adolescence, Lam filled in as cantor at congregations in West Covina 
and Highland Park but didn't perceive it as a full-time career. He briefly 
gravitated toward law, until realizing his passion -- singing -- could become 
his profession. A cantor is responsible for leading his congregation in prayer 
before God. 
</P>
<P>
He studied for several years in New York before returning to Los Angeles and 
assuming the pulpit at Stephen S. Wise in 1976. Today, he's vice president of 
the 
</P>
<P>
Cantor's Assembly, an international organization, and has released five albums 
of Jewish music. 
</P>
<P>
"Judaism has given me a sense of empathy for the people I teach," Lam said. 
"Everyone who comes to me is a voice that needs to be helped." 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, Lam's students, even the famous ones, have lost confidence in their 
singing voices. They don't believe they can reach the notes necessary for the 
next concert or musical. Lam must act as therapist, too. "When I know there's 
nothing physically wrong with their voices," he said, "I have to find ways of 
tricking them into doing things they didn't think they could do. And I'm a 
master at that." 
</P>
<P>
His students testify to his healing powers. Marq Torien, lead singer for the 
hard-rock group Bulletboys had strained his voice after two years of touring, 
screaming on stage and constant drinking. His livelihood was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"He got my voice back," Torien said. "He showed me how I had wasted so much 
energy with my voice, and how to stop doing that. He cares about me." 
</P>
<P>
About 20% of Lam's students come from physicians' referrals. Coverdale was sent 
to Lam by a doctor after undergoing surgery in April, 1986, for a deviated 
septum. "A vocal coach was completely alien to me," Coverdale said. "I went 
more out of desperation." 
</P>
<P>
Like most of Lam's pupils, Coverdale learned exercises designed to strengthen 
his chest and lung capacity. Lam teaches his students to position their 
diaphragm to move in conjunction with the vocal chords. 
</P>
<P>
"Singing should be an extension of one's speaking voice," Lam said. "If the 
vocal chords aren't in their right position, the person sounds hoarse or 
breathy." 
</P>
<P>
Until a few years ago, Lam believed everyone held the potential to develop an 
excellent singing voice. "But at that time, I hadn't seen some of the clients 
I've had since then. Not everyone can sing." 
</P>
<P>
Lam regularly trains more than 100 students, charging $60 for half an hour and 
$120 for an hour of instruction. His rate goes up for house calls. "I have no 
star rates," he said. "The rate is based on the hours, not the stars." 
</P>
<P>
Each day, Lam is reminded of his travels between the worlds of Jewish 
observance and contemporary popular music; from Friday afternoon lessons with 
Ritchie, he moves smoothly to Sabbath services with hundreds of congregants. 
The trip represents his personal statement. 
</P>
<P>
"I want my kids to see that there was a cantor who they see on Friday, who can 
be a religious Jew and be in the synagogue, and they also can see has a foot in 
the real world," Lam said."

COVER STORY: PLAY 'EM AGAIN;

<P>
MONTY HALL AND CO. RECALL THE GOOD OL' GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Game shows -- once a staple of daytime, early evening and even prime-time TV -- 
are making a comeback. Not that they've gone anywhere. This is a comeback of a 
different sort: the return of some old favorites. 
</P>
<P>
Is there anyone over 25 who never once saw "Let's Make a Deal"? The Monty Hall 
favorite returns to the airwaves Monday at 10 a.m. on NBC, sans Hall. Newcomer 
Bob Hilton gets to talk to giddy contestants in silly outfits. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's "Match Game," which brought wisecracking Gene Rayburn and a 
panel full of celebrities to homes every Monday through Friday afternoon in the 
1960s. It's coming back too, weekdays starting July 16 at 11 a.m. on ABC. No 
Rayburn though. Ross Schaefer asks the questions this time. 
</P>
<P>
And in September, NBC will air the celebrity stumper "To Tell the Truth," the 
true classic of the bunch. Australian Gordon Elliott will emceee the series, 
which originally was hosted by the late Bud Collyer. 
</P>
<P>
For anyone who watched '50s, '60s and '70s game shows, this begs some 
questions: Whatever happened to Gene Rayburn? Where is Monty Hall? And what 
about other hosts of the time when games were in their prime? 
</P>
<P>
And the answers are: 
</P>
<P>
MONTY HALL 
</P>
<P>
Game show icon of: "Let's Make a Deal," 1963-68 (NBC); 1968-1976 (ABC); 
1971-76, 1980, 1984 (syndicated). 
</P>
<P>
Let's make a game show: "It took us a year of showing it to networks before 
anyone would make a pilot. It was a radically different type of show. People 
were selected at random, and no one had seen anything like this before. Even 
after we made the pilot it took several months to get the go-ahead." 
</P>
<P>
The crazy clothing: "We never asked (the audience) to put on any costumes. 
People were sitting there in business clothes, but then a woman came with a 
sign asking me to pick her. Then someone wore a funny hat and then you had 
Phyllis Diller look-alikes. It grew and grew. But we never selected a 
contestant by what they wore. It would have been a costume competition." 
</P>
<P>
Let's make funny: "In 4,500 shows, a lot of strange things happened. An 
elephant once was behind one of the doors and (model) Carol Merrill was holding 
it by a rope. As the door opened, it got nervous and broke away from the rope 
and thundered down the loading platform and ran into Prospect Avenue." 
</P>
<P>
Let's make a memory: "A contestant who had won $300 wouldn't trade it away for 
anything. We found out after the show this woman had hitchhiked down from 
Central California and had just wanted to win something because they were in 
such desperation. I was moved by the fact that once she got the $300, no offer 
would budge her. It was a sad story. Ninety-nine percent of the people came to 
have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
Where is he now?: "My charity work takes up a lot of time. I am very much 
involved in the new show (as a consultant). I am working with the new host, Bob 
Hilton, and am going to Orlando (where the show is taping) to help get it up. 
No one knows the show better." 
</P>
<P>
GENE RAYBURN 
</P>
<P>
Game show icon of: "The Match Game," 1962-69 (NBC); 1973-79 (CBS); 1975-1981 
nighttime syndication. 
</P>
<P>
The magic of "Match Game": "In the '60s we didn't really have giant ratings. On 
CBS we had fantastic ratings. In 1975 we hit a 14.9 share. No show in the 
history of daytime has done that. 
</P>
<P>
"It got far racier and was a comedy show on CBS. No matter what kind of show I 
was doing, I really kind of instinctively made it into a comedy show. 
</P>
<P>
"Many years prior to 'Match Game' I did a show called 'Dough-Re-Mi.' Three 
weeks into the show the producer said, 'This show stinks, doesn't it? Do what 
you can to keep it on the air.' I started clowning around with it. I would sing 
songs and do a tap dance. It turned into a funny show." 
</P>
<P>
Why ABC did not hire him as host of the new "Match Game": "Just before they 
announced they were going to revive 'The Match Game,' 'Entertainment Tonight' 
wished me a happy birthday and gave my real age (72). When they heard how old I 
was they said, 'We want a young man. He may have a heart attack.' So they hired 
a young comic I never heard of before. It's such a difficult, weak format. But 
the show is the thing now; the host is nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Where is he now?: "I've got an agent who keeps calling me and says he is going 
to get something going. I wish he would; I am bored. I love to play tennis. I 
also have a house in Connecticut. I just planted some tomatoes and parsley. I 
want some good vine-ripened tomatoes." 
</P>
<P>
ART FLEMING 
</P>
<P>
Game show icon of: "Jeopardy!" 1964-1975 (NBC); 1974 (syndicated); 1978-79 
(NBC). 
</P>
<P>
Once upon a time: "I grew up on the Broadway stage. I was 4 when I made my 
debut in 'The Great Waltz.' I did 48 movies and three TV series -- 
'International Detective,' 'The Flying Tigers' and 'The Californians.' 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason I ever did 'Jeopardy!' was because I hadn't done a game show. 
I had done everything else in the business. It ran 12,858 shows." 
</P>
<P>
Where is he now?: "I live in St. Louis and I do a talk radio show for CBS Radio 
here. I thrill about the next job that I do whether it is a commercial or 
selling a product at a trade show. I just emceed the Miss Missouri contest." 
</P>
<P>
DENNIS JAMES 
</P>
<P>
Game show icon of: "Okay Mother," 1948-1951 (DuMont). 
</P>
<P>
Can't top this: "I had a woman fall on me on 'The Price Is Right.' The 
microphone cable got stuck around the camera and I couldn't step back, and she 
came bounding up the stairs so (fast), and we both went down." 
</P>
<P>
Today's game shows: "They are awfully slick now. The basically good game shows 
are the ones that are older -- 'The Price Is Right' and 'Jeopardy!' -- they 
stick around. In our days you got to become a personality with your show. I 
feel a lot of these kids you don't know. They concentrate on the contestant. 
</P>
<P>
"The game-show host was the producer on the stage. If something happened, there 
was no stopping for tape. You had to do a lot more thinking on the feet." 
</P>
<P>
Where is he now?: "I've still got my production company. I have been doing a 
lot of traveling. I do the telethon yearly for cerebral palsy. Thank God, I 
have never been out of work in all of those years." 
</P>
<P>
ART JAMES 
</P>
<P>
Game show icon of: "Who, What or Where," 1969-1974 (NBC); "Say When," 1961-65 
(NBC). 
</P>
<P>
His favorite: "Who, What or Where." "We were on after 'Jeopardy!' and we were 
the biggest things on college campuses. Activity would come to a halt." 
</P>
<P>
He remembers when: "When I was hosting 'Say When,' I was doing a live 
commercial for Peter Pan peanut butter. I said, 'It's really good to the bottom 
of the jar.' I then dropped the knife into the jar and the bottom of the jar 
broke and gobs of peanut butter came out. The audience started laughing and 
then I broke up." 
</P>
<P>
Where is he now?: "I go to corporations and stage game shows. It helps 
reinforce job skills. It's so much fun. It's so useful and it's a team-building 
program. I do 30 to 40 game shows a year. We travel around the country." 
</P>
<P>
Just say when: "I absolutely want to do more game shows. I fill in on some 
things. They go for the younger faces now. It's a constant talent hunt." 
</P>
<P>
JACK NARZ 
</P>
<P>
Game show icon of: "Dotto," 1958 (CBS/NBC); "Seven Keys," 1961-64 (ABC). 
</P>
<P>
The "Dotto" scandal: "That lasted a long six months. It went from zero to No. 
1. I was unaware of (the cheating) when I went before the grand jury. The way 
it happened was while we were on the air, one of the future contestants on the 
show went through a woman's purse in the contestants' dressing room. While 
going through the purse he discovered someone had given her some answers. He 
went to the district attorney, and it just so happened at the time the district 
attorney was running for re-election. 
</P>
<P>
"I was off the air for a couple of months. The show was sponsored by 
Colgate/Palmolive. I had been told by the president of the company, 'We know 
you are innocent. We are continuing your contract with us. We will get you back 
on the air.' The next show I did was 'Top Dollar,' which replaced 'Dotto.' " 
</P>
<P>
Where is he now?: "I am traveling a lot and playing a lot of golf and that's 
about it. The whole situation (game shows) has changed so much in the past few 
years, I am afraid I have kind of lost interest in them. But if the right 
situation came about . . . " 
</P>
<P>
What happened to his game-show host brother, Tom Kennedy?: "We worked together 
many times. At one point, this would have been in the '60s, he had 'You Don't 
Say' on NBC and I had 'I'll Bet' on NBC. I would appear on his show and he 
would be on mine as a guest. We would trade off and trade shows. He hasn't done 
anything recently. He did a pilot about three years ago with Carol Burnett 
called 'Star Play' and I thought it was as fine a show as anything on the air. 
But nothing happened. It's a vicious world."

HOW WILL "BATMAN" SHRINK? ; 
</P>
<P>
HBO AND CINEMAX BRING LAST YEAR'S DARK HERO DOWN TO TV-SCREEN SIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Holy cable television! 
</P>
<P>
 "Batman," last year's megahit (250 million bat-dollars), is making its cable 
debut this week. 
</P>
<P>
Pow! 
</P>
<P>
 With "Dick Tracy" T-shirts at almost every retailer and Tom Cruise posters 
looming from city billboards, last summer's Batmania is almost a faded memory. 
</P>
<P>
But not for Joe Desris, a Kenosha, Wisc., advertising executive, who has the 
largest collection of "Batman" memorabilia in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Zowie! 
</P>
<P>
 Desris has some bat-facts to share just in time for this week's cable 
premiere, on HBO Sunday at 8 p.m. and Tuesday at 3 p.m. on Cinemax. 
</P>
<P>
 Ker-plow! 
</P>
<P>
 And just how many times has he seen "Batman" take flight? 
</P>
<P>
"I lost count after a while," he said with bat-sigh. "I was out in Los Angeles 
last year and saw the film about a week before it came out. 
</P>
<P>
"Interestingly enough, there was a really brief scene they subsequently cut 
out. It was when Batman was in the Batmobile and he drives into Ajax Chemical 
Company and blows it up. When he drives out and gets out of his car, he looks 
up and the Joker is in his helicopter. There were 10 or 15 seconds they cut 
out, which is just as well because it looked like a toy helicopter." 
</P>
<P>
Holy whirlybird! 
</P>
<P>
 Desris found a lot to like in the Michael Keaton-Jack Nicholson action flick, 
especially the Oscar-winning art and set design. "There is this contrast in the 
architecture," he said. "There is modern stuff and throwbacks to the 1880s. The 
scene where reporter Alexander Knox is in the office of Vicki Vale -- there's a 
good contrast with the manual typewriter on the desk and Knox's microcassette 
recorder -- it's set in the '40s, the '90s and in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Zounds! 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most visually impressive scenes to Desris is set during the opening 
moments when two crooks are on the top of a building and Batman mysteriously 
pops down behind them. But, he said, some of that is lost on the small screen. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the things in the Ajax chemical factory with all the steam and the 
liquid escaping are good," Desris said. "Some moments in the bat cave are 
interesting, but they may be trouble on TV. It's like translating the chase 
scene in 'Bullitt' onto a 19-inch TV. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really fun to see a movie like this on the big screen because of the 
whole audience participation thing. It's much more enjoyable." 
</P>
<P>
Though Desris saw the film countless times and owns the video, he's the first 
to confess "Batman" is a flawed creature. 
</P>
<P>
Thud! 
</P>
<P>
 "'Some grade school back east had bats in the lunchroom and they had to get 
the kids out of there because of the stench," said Desris, laughing. 
"Obviously, if you have bat droppings all over the place, it will be a pretty 
nasty smelling bat cave. 
</P>
<P>
"There are other things: Batman designed this really interesting craft that 
could fly all over the place, but the Joker could shoot it down with an 
itty-bitty gun. And if the Joker fell from that high of a building why would 
his body still be intact?" 
</P>
<P>
Holy gaffes! 
</P>
<P>
Desris quickly pointed out, though, that he once read an article about "Star 
Wars" which pointed out the 1977 George Lucas classic contained more than 150 
mistakes. "As much as I like 'Rear Window' and 'Psycho,' there are flaws in 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Powie! 
</P>
<P>
 Desris hasn't seen "Dick Tracy" and has no inkling if the highly publicized 
Warren Beatty film will cause as big a flap at the box office. "Last week I was 
in a Target store and they had a whole aisle devoted to 'Dick Tracy' stuff, 
which was great, but nobody was there," he said. "(Last year) if you found any 
stuff in toy stores on 'Batman,' there would be 18 kids around it or it was 
already sold out. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great (Disney) has made plans in advance and made all this stuff 
available, but when you plan a blockbuster, it's not a blockbuster," Desris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Warners aired its first ("Batman") TV spot, I think, on Memorial Day. They 
didn't want to give away a lot of things. Whereas with 'Tracy,' you could get 
stuff a long time ago. 
</P>
<P>
"(Warners) didn't know if 'Batman' was going to be great. There was a lot of 
publicity, but it wasn't coming from Warners; it was coming from the media and 
all the fans." 
</P>
<P>
Kaboom!

SHE WAS PAID the ultimate compliment: A few years ago two of her works were 
stolen from a Westwood gallery along with a Miro, a Dali and a Lichtenstein. 
Beverly Bigwood is an artiste du papier. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, when the rest of us graduated elementary school and left behind 
construction-paper days, she continued to play with the colored paper, 
ultimately developing it into an art form. Her whimsical folk-art portraits 
have adorned the walls of such widely known L.A. restaurants as Spago, Nucleus 
Nuance, 7th Street Bistro and El Cholo and have appeared in such prominent 
stores as Giorgio and Fred Segal. 
</P>
<P>
Following a telephone interview with a customer, during which a discussion of 
mood and color takes place, Bigwood works from a photograph, cutting, ripping 
and otherwise molding the client's personality into a finished collage. Her 
pieces are particularly popular as gifts for weddings, for parents of newborns 
and for husbands, wives and other significant others. The lively, animated 
portraits measure 16x20 inches and sell for $90.

PLANNING TO PROPOSE to your sweetheart but don't know how to do it? A 15-foot 
red heart stationed outside her home is sure to score a yes. And when the big 
day of the nuptials finally arrives, Adams Balloon Advertising can drape a 
banner over a giant inflatable, replete with personal message and internal 
lighting. 
</P>
<P>
In this city of air kisses and overblown egos, there is now a way to send 
appropriately grandiose holiday and personal messages: with a custom inflated 
balloon that lights up with your special salutation. Adams will set up a 
33x30-foot birthday cake inflatable (for $450) on your father's front lawn 
decorated with a personal message (24x20-foot is $350, 11x9-foot is $150). Or, 
depending on your relationship and the intended greeting, maybe a 22-foot-high 
gorilla ($350) -- or a 25-foot-high clown ($350; 18 feet, $250) -- would best 
do the trick. And when Halloween rolls around this fall, there are giant 
jack-o'-lanterns and friendly ghosts, and for Christmas, robust Santas and 
snowmen and such.

LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five years ago, sculptor Terry Thornsley found a 700-pound mass of dull rock 
buried in a dust-dry mountain in Yucca Valley. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, it was unveiled as Thornsley's latest work of art, a 
five-foot-high, gleaming marble sculpture of a playful sea lion swimming 
happily past a coral reef. 
</P>
<P>
It was expected to be a big hit at this year's Festival of Arts of Laguna 
Beach, which opened Saturday and will run for seven weeks. After all, Thornsley 
said, the future shape of the black marble he began working on five weeks ago 
was etched in stone from the start in his head. 
</P>
<P>
"When I looked at this stone, I said, 'That was it,' " Thornsley said about the 
piece, priced at $20,000 and finished a day before Saturday's official opening 
of the festival on Laguna Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday, the first of an expected 250,000 visitors began filtering into 
the Festival of the Arts compound to view, price and sometimes buy the works of 
164 artists who live in the beach communities from Newport Beach to San 
Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Escaping the hectic traffic and a steady stream of beach-goers headed for 
nearby Main Beach, 8,500 tourists, locals and amateur art critics wandered 
through the maze of works, enjoying classical music and free wine and cheese. 
</P>
<P>
"It's got such a cultural feel to it," said Ellen Gonnering of Mission Viejo, 
who sat on a park bench listening to classical guitarist Eric Henderson deftly 
strumming "Capricho Arabe" by Francisco Taraga. "This is my favorite festival 
in Laguna Beach. We try to come at least once a year." 
</P>
<P>
Two other art exhibits, the Sawdust Festival and the Art-A-Fair, are across the 
street from the Festival of the Arts grounds and are also open most of the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
The Festival of the Arts, however, is the oldest and considered the premier 
festival in this community that draws thousands of tourists to its shores each 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
The artists, who displayed works ranging from handcrafted purses and guitars to 
oil paintings and sculptures, were chosen in March from more than 300 local 
artists. The festival is open until Aug. 26, festival spokeswoman Sally Reeve 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The opening of the festival, which began in 1932, was marked by a special 
Friday night VIP preview of the Pageant of the Masters in Irvine Bowl, an 
outdoor theater nestled into a wall of Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pageant of the Masters, volunteers take part in "living pictures," or 
re-creations of great works of art, including Leonardo da Vinci's "The Last 
Supper," Emanuel Luetze's "Washington Crossing the Delaware" and Claude Monet's 
"Women in the Garden." 
</P>
<P>
The two-hour show is "difficult to explain but a delight to see," Reeve said. 
Its proceeds underwrite the daily art exhibit, which costs the festival 
organization about $600 an artist during the course of the festival. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the pageant proceeds are used to grant more than $200,000 in 
scholarships and grants to Laguna Beach High School and local college students, 
Reeve said. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pageant of the Masters is what draws the people to the festival," which is 
at the mouth of Laguna Canyon, just three blocks from Main Beach, Reeve said. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors wander among the colorful, avant-garde pottery, impressionistic 
watercolors, whimsical wall hangings and cases of shiny jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Art pieces -- including one-of-a-kind guitars, purses and Angora sweaters -- 
are priced from less than $100 to more than $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
"It does attract buyers, good-quality buyers," Reeve said, sitting in her 
office Saturday. "I get excited when I go out there." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit is important to artists because for most of them, it is the only 
chance to display their works. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just the immediate sales that make this worthwhile," Thornsley said, 
"but it's contacts you make and the friends you meet." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, animal artist Chris Hoy, who sat in his cubicle and worked on a 
portrait of a prize-winning schnauzer, said he displays his works only at the 
Festival of the Arts. But the 80 or so contacts he makes keep him busy -- and 
well paid -- for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach artist Roarke Gourley, who creates whimsical, cartoon-like wall 
hangings, sold his first work without being at the festival. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Popkin, 34, of Los Angeles came early to the festival, armed with a 
checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
"I definitely came to buy something for my wall," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She found the perfect piece when she rounded a corner and was struck by two of 
Gourley's works: "Mikee's Teeth," a rendering of a baby biting the tail of the 
family cat, and "Cat Nap," a three-dimensional wall hanging of an orange cat 
sleeping on a green couch with colorful fish floating past its head. 
</P>
<P>
Others attended the festival's opening day simply to feast their eyes on local 
talent. Romanian-born Simon Bercovici gushed over a watercolor of Istanbul, 
although he admitted that he could not afford the work. 
</P>
<P>
"It's mystical," he told artist Harold Lambert, a successful architect who gave 
up his profession of 30 years to be a full-time artist two years ago. "You 
caught the flavor of the city very well. It's a very nice subject." 
</P>
<P>
Bercovici and his wife, Leo, have been coming to the festival every year since 
they emigrated in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
"The colors are very calming," Leo Bercovici said, wearing a You Gotta Have Art 
T-shirt from the Laguna Beach Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
"I can look at this painting for a long time without getting tired."

DIANNE KLEIN: THE MUUMUU'S IMAGE FLAWS MAY BE TOO BIG TO ALTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dianne Klein 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
These days, Oscar Alcaindo is saying, the muumuu business is not too good. Oh, 
it's not the muumuus themselves, you understand, but the apparel industry in 
general. Lousy. People aren't buying clothes, they're not buying muumuus. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar has talked with others in the business -- not the muumuu business, of 
course, because Oscar doesn't know anybody else in the muumuu business -- but 
in the clothing industry as a whole. And that's what they tell him. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not doing too hot," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar pauses. Then he gives me a look. OK, he knows it's true. Muumuus have an 
image problem. Which is why Oscar called me in the first place. I was wondering 
in a recent column about what ever happened to muumuus. 
</P>
<P>
The last time I remember seeing a muumuu was about 15 years ago, on a friend of 
my mother who was pregnant with her third child -- but nobody ever suspected 
until she came home from the hospital with an infant. 
</P>
<P>
Don't get me wrong. This was a wonderful woman, a very large, wonderful woman. 
If you catch my drift. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar does. He nods his head and smiles. Wistfully. 
</P>
<P>
Those were the days. The '70s. Back then, Oscar and his wife, Alex -- the other 
half of Oscar and Alex Fashions in Fullerton -- were relatively new to the 
business, and their sewing machines were running almost nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
"We were selling to Sears, J.C. Penney, Lane Bryant, Mervyn's, all kinds of 
stores," Oscar says. "One time, we were on vacation in Hawaii, and we decided 
to go into Sears, and we saw some muumuus that looked like ours, so we looked 
at the label, and they were ours. So even in Hawaii, they know our muumuus." 
</P>
<P>
Of course, things have slowed down considerably since then. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's just Oscar and Alex doing everything, making patterns, cutting, sewing 
and selling out of their retail shop in front. About three years ago, they 
branched out into men's Hawaiian shirts, made of muumuu fabrics. Children's 
sizes they'll make to order. Prices are very reasonable, most of them under 
$30. 
</P>
<P>
You do what you can. Not everyone wants muumuus these days. 
</P>
<P>
It's the times, Oscar says. 
</P>
<P>
"I see people on the street, I tell my wife, 'That person should be wearing a 
muumuu.' But you can't tell these people that. They don't want to know. They 
follow the new styles, the new look, and they don't care how they are going to 
look on them. Old ladies dressing like teen-agers. Fat people in T-shirts. Can 
you tell them? You cannot." 
</P>
<P>
Oscar himself is not clothed in muumuu fabric. He's natty in a pink polo shirt, 
white polyester pants, white socks and shoes. But then he changes into a 
Hawaiian shirt, saying that for his customers he makes them a little wider 
through the waist. 
</P>
<P>
The mailman walks into the shop and hands Oscar a packet of envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, nice shirt," the mailman says. Smirking. 
</P>
<P>
Oscar laughs, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
"That guy, he's a clown," Oscar says. 
</P>
<P>
Alex, meanwhile, is dressed in a muumuu, a slimmer version of the off-the-rack 
styles, with a belt. Back home in Chile, from where she and Oscar emigrated in 
1971, the couple had never seen such festive garb. And to this day, as far as 
the Alcaindos know, Chileans are still in the dark about muumuus. 
</P>
<P>
"It might be a hot item to introduce in Chile," Oscar says. 
</P>
<P>
But without much conviction. 
</P>
<P>
"The business started changing when the competition from the Orient came in," 
he goes on. "The department stores, they could get muumuus cheaper in the 
Orient. Labor costs are less. But the quality and the fitting is not the same." 
</P>
<P>
"Fitting?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
Muumuus are not fitted. Muumuus are shoulder seams, a yoke, maybe a ruffle or 
two along the bottom if you're talking fancy. They are very loose. Which, of 
course, is the whole point. 
</P>
<P>
So Oscar looks at me with the bemused look of one about to impart great wisdom 
to a particularly dense newcomer, in this case, to the muumuu business. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, fitting," he says. "In the Orient, they are littler. The clothes, 
they're smaller. Not like the ones made here. That's why ladies come in saying 
they wear a 3X." 
</P>
<P>
"Three X?" I interrupt. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, yeah," Oscar says. "Three extra large. But I tell them, 'You can get 
away with one X.' They say, 'No way! I've been wearing 3X.' But I show them. I 
say, 'Here, try this.' And it fits perfectly. Well, can you imagine? Going from 
3X to 1X. Wow! And I haven't even gone on a diet. They love it!" 
</P>
<P>
Well, of course they do. Oscar is a very personable fellow. He knows his 
muumuus -- which were at the zenith of their popularity in Southern California 
during the early '60s -- and his customers. And after 17 years in the business, 
Oscar's got all sorts of theories about both. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing you notice is the way someone dresses," he says. "If I see a 
lady, no matter how fat, if she is wearing a T-shirt, she is not a muumuu 
person. . . . Or else, she would wear one only indoors. She'd never be caught 
on the street with one." 
</P>
<P>
Which, in Oscar's estimation, is a crying shame. 
</P>
<P>
"We are so conscious of our looks," he says. "Especially in Orange County. 
People think they have to wear the same as the neighbor, look the same and 
drive the same kind of car. We should stop worrying so much about our looks and 
start worrying about our comfort." 
</P>
<P>
And start wearing muumuus. If Oscar does say so himself. 
</P>

7 SEA SCOUTS, ADVISERS RESCUED AS BOAT SINKS; 
</P>

DANA POINT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shawn Wehan, 15, recalled on Saturday that the order to abandon ship was "a big 
surprise, totally unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
Wehan was one of seven teen-age Sea Scouts sailing on the 72-foot ketch Mariner 
from Dana Point to Santa Catalina Island on Friday night. Their adult adviser, 
Robert Fagnant, came from a below-deck inspection about 7:30 p.m. and calmly 
told Wehan that the sailboat was leaking badly and was sinking. 
</P>
<P>
Wehan was trained in Sea Scout radio skills and Fagnant told him to put out a 
"Mayday call" for help and to prepare to leave the rapidly sinking vessel. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have time to be scared," said Wehan, who was standing in the water 
that flooded the boat as he made the radio calls. "You can't panic in that kind 
of situation. And I knew what to do." 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard and other officials on Saturday said that "knowing what to do" 
spelled the difference between safety and disaster on Friday night as the Sea 
Scout sailing ship sank only about 10 minutes after it began springing major 
leaks. The teen-agers and two adults on board all escaped without injury as the 
boat plunged to the ocean floor about eight miles off the coast of Catalina in 
3- to 4-foot swells. 
</P>
<P>
The nine crew members were rescued by Mike Hollos, a sergeant with the Orange 
County Sheriff's Department, who answered a call from the Coast Guard asking 
for assistance from any boats in the vicinity of the Mariner. Hollos, who was 
headed to Avalon with his wife, Heidi, and daughter, Jessica, aboard their 
powerboat My High, also said the experience of the scouts helped avert 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"Something like that is always dangerous, but it appeared to go smoothly," 
Hollos said. "If they hadn't drilled on it, it could have been a real problem. 
It was extremely rough and very windy." 
</P>
<P>
Fagnant said the leak was apparently caused when the caulking that sealed the 
hull's wooden planks failed. He said the boat, built in the 1940s on the East 
Coast and originally used as an oyster fishing boat on Chesapeake Bay, received 
$9,000 worth of repairs and an overhauling only two months ago. The Mariner had 
been extensively water tested after the maintenance and no problems showed up, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The boat was donated to the Sea Scouts for training cruises about nine years 
ago, Fagnant said. He estimated the value of the Mariner at about $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Lifeguard Lt. Paul McIlroy said the teen-agers -- four boys 
and three girls who ranged from 15 to 18 -- were excited after their rescue at 
sea. "It was like a new episode in their life," McIlroy said. 
</P>
<P>
The nine persons on the Mariner all boarded an emergency dinghy on the sailboat 
and paddled away minutes before the crippled vessel went under. After they were 
picked up by the My High, they were transferred to a lifeguard boat from Avalon 
that responded to the distress call, and then to a Coast Guard boat for the 
return to the mainland, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, adult adviser Fagnant recounted the events that led to the 
successful evacuation of the sailboat. 
</P>
<P>
"All the kids are from the San Clemente-Dana Point area, and we were headed to 
Catalina for a weekend trip," Fagnant said. "It was about 7:30 p.m. that this 
took place, and I was at the helm. Shawn had gone below to change clothes, and 
he came back up and told me I should look at what was happening below. So I 
gave him the wheel and went below, and I perceived we were taking on water at a 
very fast rate. I told Shawn to send out Maydays -- that we were going under. 
And I then told the crew that we would put the dinghy in the water and we would 
disembark. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything went very well," Fagnant said. "These kids have had a lot of 
training; they get a lot of discipline in seamanship skills in the Sea Scout 
program and they all knew the procedure for something like this if it ever was 
to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Wehan said he knew the boat had sprung a leak but was surprised that it 
necessitated abandoning ship. But what Wehan did not know at the time, Fagnant 
explained, was that the small leak quickly became a gusher below decks. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I went down to check, there was only about three inches of 
water," Fagnant said. "But the second time I went down, a few minutes later, 
there was 12 inches of water. The water was coming in at a very fast rate. The 
joints between the planking had broken loose around the starboard bow." 
</P>
<P>
Fagnant said there was no panic or disorder as the teen-agers and his wife, 
Vicki, 27, prepared to evacuate the Mariner. "Vicki was along as the chaperon 
for the girls, and it was her first sailing trip, and I guess it was not what 
she expected," Fagnant said. 
</P>
<P>
"The water was rising fast, and Shawn was standing in water as he made his 
radio calls. Shawn made contact with both the Coast Guard and the My High, and 
I could see the My High about three-quarters of a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
"We hand-lifted the dinghy into the water, and one by one filed into it. I was 
the last to leave, and just before leaving, I took off the American flag and 
carried it with me. We then pulled away as quickly as we could from the 
Mariner, because we didn't want to be near if anything struck around us. Then 
she (the Mariner) went under. But we weren't in the dinghy very long, maybe two 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
Hollos said the Mariner was about two miles from his vessel when he first heard 
the distress call and it took about five minutes at top speed to reach the 
boat. He said it sank just as he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"They were just screaming and yelling, 'Thank you, thank you, thank you,' " 
Hollos said. "Everyone was comfortable, although a little scared." 
</P>
<P>
The Mariner sank in about 300 feet of water, Fagnant said. He added that it "is 
extremely doubtful" that any attempt would be made to try to raise it, because 
of the depth involved. 
</P>
<P>
Wehan, who will be a sophomore next fall at Dana Hills High School, said that 
he was impressed at how orderly everyone was during the evacuation. And he said 
there was general sadness among the Sea Scouts in losing their training ship. 
"We've spent a lot of time working on that boat; it was like all that was going 
down with it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fagnant said the last seconds of the Mariner were especially dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
"Just before it went totally under, the two Sea Scout flags on the two masts 
fluttered above the water for awhile, and I guess that is something these kids 
will remember a long time," he said.

D.A. SAYS POLICE WERE JUSTIFIED IN 3 FATAL SHOOTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Orange County district attorney's office has determined that law 
enforcement officers were justified in the shooting deaths of three men in 
March and April, including two who were unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi said Saturday that an investigation of the 
shootings proved that the officers involved had "no criminal liability" in the 
deaths. In the two cases involving unarmed victims, the district attorney's 
review concluded that the officers had reason to believe the men were reaching 
for weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The fatal shootings investigated were those of Eric Parga, 22, of Santa Ana on 
March 16; Kenneth Wade Collins, 28, of Garden Grove on March 28, and Jose de 
Jesus Ramos Gonzalez, 27, of Santa Ana on April 4. 
</P>
<P>
Parga was fatally wounded during a parking lot brawl outside the Carnivale Club 
in Fullerton. The incident, which occurred about 2 a.m. on March 16, involved 
seven people fighting in the parking lot, during which some shots were fired, 
according to police reports. 
</P>
<P>
Two off-duty Los Angeles Police Department officers were working as private 
security guards and heard the gunshots in the parking lot area, according to 
investigators. The officers, Randy Garcia, 34, and David Navarro, 32, went to 
the scene and saw Parga with a .22-caliber pistol, the investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia ordered Parga to drop the gun, but Parga fired the weapon at the group 
of fighting men around him, investigators said. Officer Garcia then shot Parga, 
according to the investigation. The district attorney's office said residue of 
powder burns was found on Parga's hands, proving that he had fired a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Collins was fatally shot about 10:45 p.m. March 28 outside a Circle K store in 
the 2200 block of Chapman Avenue in Stanton. A deputy sheriff, who was not 
identified, shot Collins after two struggles with him and after Collins refused 
to stop running, according to investigators. 
</P>
<P>
Collins was unarmed when he was shot, but Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan Brown said 
Saturday the deputy fired "because the officer thought he was going for a gun." 
Earlier, while the two men were struggling, Brown said, a big, combat-style 
knife fell to the ground from Collins' clothing. "It was one awesome knife," 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The deputy had tried to stop Collins for questioning, and Collins began 
fighting him, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said Saturday that he investigated the incident and found that Collins 
was carrying "a large amount of methamphetamines" at the time of the shooting 
incident. Brown said Collins also had taken some of the drug himself. 
</P>
<P>
The fatal shooting of Gonzalez occurred about 2 p.m. on April 4 outside a 
7-Eleven market on the corner of Williams and Main streets in Tustin. Orange 
police officers approached Gonzalez in his car to arrest him on suspicion of 
selling drugs, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, who was unarmed, was shot when one officer said he saw Gonzalez 
reaching underneath his car seat, possibly for a weapon, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer then fired one shot, investigators said. Another officer then fired 
four more shots, according to the investigation. The officers were not 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez did not have a weapon, but Capizzi said the investigation determined 
that both police officers had reason to believe their lives were being 
threatened.

A man who had just gotten into his car in his apartment garage was shot in the 
face Saturday morning, apparently by a robber who then fled. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified the victim as Miguel Ontivarez Guzman, 25, of 992 N. Highland 
St., Apt. 2. He was listed in critical condition at Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they suspect that it was a robbery attempt. As soon as Guzman got 
into his driver's seat about 7:10 a.m., he heard a voice behind him, turned 
toward the back seat and was shot in the face, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
Guzman staggered back to his apartment, where friends called police. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said they could not yet tell whether the gunman stole anything.

ROBBER FIRES HANDGUN IN HUNTINGTON BEACH BANK

<P>
A man who escaped with money from several tellers after firing a shot in an 
unoccupied area of a bank remained at large on Saturday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The robber entered a branch of Security Pacific Bank, 16811 Algonquin St., at 
5:10 p.m. Friday and fired one shot from a handgun at a window in the building, 
said Huntington Beach Police Sgt. Louis Ochoa. 
</P>
<P>
No one was standing near the window and none of the 20 employees and customers 
inside the bank was injured, Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it was a way of getting (the people's) attention," Ochoa said. "He 
told everybody in the bank that it was a robbery." 
</P>
<P>
The suspect then went to each of five teller windows, put an undisclosed amount 
of cash into a bag, and fled out the front door, Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect is described as a man of medium build in his late 30s, 5-foot-9 
with black curly hair and a beard. He was wearing sunglasses, a brown cap and 
dark pants. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators believe the weapon used was a .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol.

THESE WORLD CUP BROADCASTS ARE ALMOST AS GOOD AS BEING THERE; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: SPANISH NETWORK ANNOUNCERS WATCH GAMES IN LAGUNA NIGUEL STUDIO, BUT 
THE ACTION'S IN ITALY. ARRANGEMENT HASN'T HURT RATINGS.

LAGUNA NIGUEL 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An hour into a World Cup soccer match in Italy last week, West German defender 
Andreas Brehme launched a kick that bounced off an English player's backside, 
ricocheted high into the air and flew over sprawled English goaltender Peter 
Shilton into the net. 
</P>
<P>
"Goooooollllllllllllllll! Gooooooollllllllllllll!" shouted Andres Cantor, 
play-by-play man for the Spanish-language Univision television network, 
momentarily transporting millions of viewers in the United States to Turin's 
delirious Stadio Delle Alpi. "Golllll, Alemania!" 
</P>
<P>
But Cantor was about as close to Italy as a pizza from Domino's. Before each 
game during the monthlong futbol frenzy, he and color commentator Norberto 
Longo don blue blazers with network logos, splash on a little makeup in the 
men's room and hunker down in Univision's studio in Laguna Niguel. They call 
the games from 6,300 miles away, over a steady background din of stadium crowd 
noise, while watching on a TV monitor six feet in front of their noses. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't tell people we're in Italy," said Univision senior producer Art 
Izquierdo. "We're not trying to fool anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not, but you don't hear Cantor or Longo beginning their World Cup 
broadcasts with a greeting from the well-known soccer hotbed of Orange County, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they simply tell their viewers that the games are coming to them 
"live," which they are, courtesy of Italian TV and a satellite relay through 
Mexico City., Their broadcasts reach 512 stations across the country, including 
Los Angeles' KMEX Channel 34. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, sending Cantor and Longo to Italy for the World Cup tournament would 
have made little sense for Univision. The tournament is structured so that 
games are played in several cities within the host country, sometimes on the 
same day, and Cantor and Longo are Univision's sole broadcast team. From Laguna 
Niguel, they can announce two games in one day from cities on opposite ends of 
the country, and cut to Univision's four reporters and crews in Italy to 
provide live interviews with coaches and players. 
</P>
<P>
And the pair's distance from the games hasn't hurt Univision's ratings. KMEX 
has seen its audience jump by 25% to 50% during the World Cup matches, and the 
station is outdrawing the English-language soccer broadcasts on the TNT cable 
channel 5 to 1. The competition concludes with today's championship match 
between West Germany and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
There are drawbacks to announcing from a studio, however. "You get limited 
vision and only see what everyone else sees too," Cantor said. "I try to 
anticipate the plays, and if I'm wrong, I correct myself immediately." 
</P>
<P>
He's not wrong too often. Rarely glancing at the lineup sheets he has scribbled 
in front of him, Cantor immediately identifies the small images on the screen 
and calls the action almost before it occurs. 
</P>
<P>
"I do this every week of the year," said Cantor, who announces Univision's 
weekly international soccer broadcasts from the Laguna Niguel studio. "At this 
stage, I've seen the players time in and time out." 
</P>
<P>
Cantor, 27, grew up in Buenos Aires but moved to Pasadena with his parents as a 
teen-ager. He played soccer and graduated from San Marino High School, then 
studied journalism at USC. He has been doing the weekly Univision broadcasts 
for about three years; this is his first World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Cantor's distinctive gol! cry isn't really much different from those of other 
Spanish-language soccer announcers, all of whom draw the three-letter word out 
for several seconds, at least. 
</P>
<P>
"A goal is the climax of the action, and there may be only one of them a game," 
Cantor said. "All the Latin announcers call the goals the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Longo, 46, is also Argentine. He is Univision's regular boxing announcer, but 
he has broadcast seven World Cup soccer tournaments on radio or television, and 
brings to the game an outspoken style that sometimes makes his producers 
cringe. 
</P>
<P>
When a French referee began showboating in a pivotal Italy-Argentina match, 
Longo railed against him. "This referee is fatal," he said. "He wants to be the 
protagonist, he wants to make a show. . . . He is so on top of the action that 
he's making a nuisance of himself." 
</P>
<P>
With his rich baritone voice and penchant for sports psychology, Longo has no 
problem imbuing the contests with his own sense of drama from the darkened 
Univision studio. The closing minutes of each game are "the moment of truth." 
Well-struck shots are "impresionante" or "violentisima." Wednesday, he 
described the England-West Germany epic like this: 
</P>
<P>
"England is trying to replace technique with energy and desire. . . . Here is 
the difference in this game: the superior skill of Germany and the vigor of 
England . . . an old clash between two things almost as traditional as soccer 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
Both announcers said calling the games from the studio is more exhausting than 
working from a booth at the stadium. "We have to concentrate so that it's as if 
we're in the stadium," Longo said. "It's a great effort to transmit the emotion 
of the game." 
</P>
<P>
After the England-Germany overtime encounter, which ended at 2 p.m. PDT, but 11 
p.m. in Italy, Cantor said he felt ready to go to sleep. "For me, it's midnight 
already," he said. "When I see it's dark in the stadium, I feel like it's 
nighttime here as well." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the pair will announce their last game -- the Cup final between powerful 
West Germany and defending champion Argentina. With thousands of Argentines in 
the United States tuned in and praying for an upset, will Cantor's heritage 
make it a difficult game for him to call?

"A hoy there, mate! We've gathered many a treasure from foreign shores. . . ." 
Who said that? Relax, it's only the electronically wired pirate dummy stationed 
by the front door, the first clue that you've embarked on a voyage into the 
unusual. Indeed, the nautical treasures waiting to be discovered in The Sea are 
wondrous and plentiful -- much like the wonders of the sea itself. 
</P>
<P>
A circus of giant fiberglass dolphins, sharks and whales hangs from the 
ceiling. Skeletons of sea mammals adorn the walls. As you navigate your way 
through the aisles, you'll encounter shells most landlubbers never knew 
existed, scrimshaw, minerals, fossils, ships in bottles and naval relics. If 
it's related to the seven seas, you'll find it here -- somewhere.

SHOPPERS WHO NEED a break from their neighborhood mall but are not quite ready 
for Melrose Avenue might want to try the Guildhouse. Housed in a converted 
men's dormitory next to Barlow Hospital in Elysian Park, the Guildhouse doesn't 
stock the dusty trinkets found in most hospital gift shops; retired 
doctor-and-nurse couple Arnold and Margaret Freed scour the world for 
treasures, from hand-carved wooden birds from China to hand-carved ceramics 
from Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
"Every place I go -- all over the world -- I stick my nose in shops and see 
what they're selling," Margaret Freed says. The beautifully handmade Polish 
boxes finished by chip carving are one such recent Guildhouse addition. "The 
government put sanctions on these things years ago," she explains. Now, with 
the changes in Eastern Europe, tariffs have been lifted, and the boxes are once 
again available. "This is the first shipment we've been able to get in a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Gifts from the Guildhouse (open weekend afternoons only) are priced to suit 
even the tightest budgets, and proceeds benefit Barlow Hospital.

TELEVISION: SPANISH NETWORK ANNOUNCERS WATCH SOCCER TOURNAMENT IN LAGUNA NIGUEL 
STUDIO, BUT THE ACTION'S IN ITALY. ARRANGEMENT HASN'T HURT RATINGS.

LAGUNA NIGUEL 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An hour into a World Cup soccer match in Italy this week, West German defender 
Andreas Brehme launched a kick that bounced off an English player's backside, 
ricocheted high into the air and flew over sprawled English goaltender Peter 
Shilton into the net. 
</P>
<P>
"Goooooollllllllllllllll! Gooooooollllllllllllll!" shouted Andres Cantor, 
play-by-play man for the Spanish-language Univision television network, 
momentarily transporting millions of viewers in the United States to Turin's 
delirious Stadio Delle Alpi. "Golllll, Alemania!" 
</P>
<P>
But Cantor was about as close to Italy as a pizza from Domino's. Before each 
game during the monthlong futbol frenzy, he and color commentator Norberto 
Longo don blue blazers with network logos, splash on a little makeup in the 
men's room and hunker down in Univision's studio in suburban Laguna Niguel. 
They call the games from 6,300 miles away, over a steady background din of 
stadium crowd noise, while watching on a TV monitor six feet in front of their 
noses. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't tell people we're in Italy," said Univision senior producer Art 
Izquierdo. "We're not trying to fool anybody." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not, but you don't hear Cantor or Longo beginning their World Cup 
broadcasts, which reach 512 stations across the country -- including Los 
Angeles' KMEX Channel 34 -- with a greeting from the well-known soccer hotbed 
of Orange County, either. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they simply tell their viewers that the games are coming to them 
"live," which they are, courtesy of Italian TV and a satellite relay through 
Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, sending Cantor and Longo to Italy for the World Cup tournament would 
have made little sense for Univision. The tournament is structured so that 
games are played in several cities within the host country, sometimes on the 
same day, and Cantor and Longo are Univision's sole broadcast team. From Laguna 
Niguel, they can announce two games in one day from cities on opposite ends of 
the country, and cut to Univision's four reporters and crews in Italy to 
provide live interviews with coaches and players. 
</P>
<P>
And the pair's distance from the games hasn't hurt Univision's ratings. KMEX 
has seen its audience jump by 25% to 50% during the World Cup matches, and the 
station is outdrawing the English-language soccer broadcasts on the TNT cable 
channel 5 to 1. The competition concludes with today's championship match 
between West Germany and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
There are drawbacks to announcing from a studio, however. "You get limited 
vision, and only see what everyone else sees too," said Cantor. "I try to 
anticipate the plays, and if I'm wrong, I correct myself immediately." 
</P>
<P>
He's not wrong too often. Rarely glancing at the lineup sheets he has scribbled 
in front of him, Cantor immediately identifies the small images on the screen 
and calls the action almost before it occurs. 
</P>
<P>
"I do this every week of the year," explained Cantor, who announces Univision's 
weekly international soccer broadcasts from the Laguna Niguel studio. "At this 
stage, I've seen the players time in and time out." 
</P>
<P>
Cantor, 27, grew up in Buenos Aires but moved to Pasadena with his parents as a 
teen-ager. He played soccer and graduated from San Marino High School, then 
studied journalism at USC. He has been doing the weekly Univision broadcasts 
for about three years; this is his first World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Cantor's distinctive gol! cry isn't really much different from those of other 
Spanish-language soccer announcers, all of whom draw the three-letter word out 
for several seconds, at least. 
</P>
<P>
"A goal is the climax of the action, and there may be only one of them a game," 
said Cantor. "All the Latin announcers call the goals the same way." 
</P>
<P>
Longo, 46, is also Argentine. He is Univision's regular boxing announcer, but 
he has broadcast seven World Cup soccer tournaments on radio or television, and 
brings to the game an outspoken style that sometimes makes his producers 
cringe. 
</P>
<P>
When a French referee began showboating in a pivotal Italy-Argentina match, 
Longo railed against him. "This referee is fatal," he said. "He wants to be the 
protagonist, he wants to make a show. . . . He is so on top of the action that 
he's making a nuisance of himself." 
</P>
<P>
With his rich baritone voice and penchant for sports psychology, Longo has no 
problem imbuing the contests with his own sense of drama from the darkened 
Univision studio. The closing minutes of each game are "the moment of truth." 
Well-struck shots are "impresionante" or "violentisima." Last Wednesday, he 
described the England-West Germany epic like this: 
</P>
<P>
"England is trying to replace technique with energy and desire. . . . Here is 
the difference in this game: the superior skill of Germany and the vigor of 
England . . . an old clash between two things almost as traditional as soccer 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
Both announcers say that calling the games from the studio is more exhausting 
than working from a booth at the stadium. "We have to concentrate so that it's 
as if we're in the stadium," says Longo. "It's a great effort to transmit the 
emotion of the game." 
</P>
<P>
After the England-Germany overtime encounter, which ended at 2 p.m. here, but 
11 p.m. in Italy, Cantor said he felt ready to go to sleep. "For me, it's 
midnight already," he said. "When I see it's dark in the stadium, I feel like 
it's nighttime here as well." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the pair will announce their last game -- the Cup final between powerful 
West Germany and defending champion Argentina. With thousands of Argentines in 
the United States tuned in and praying for an upset, will Cantor's heritage 
make it a difficult game for him to call? 
</P>
<P>
"No, of course not," he said. "I'm a professional, I call all the games the 
same. But I would be a hypocrite if I told you my heart wasn't with Argentina."

...AND NOW IT'S DAVID MINUS DAVID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
David Baerwald is nursing an ice tea under an umbrella at a Topanga Canyon cafe 
on this scorching summer day; he looks as if he should be nursing an ice pack 
as well. It's a serious hangover. "Dave and I decided to finish off a bottle of 
whiskey over at his house last night," he explains, "but it finished us off 
instead." 
</P>
<P>
The drinking buddy in question is David Ricketts, Baerwald's former partner in 
the celebrated but short-lived duo David + David. Their one and only album, 
"Boomtown," was an instant critical favorite in 1986, and the single "Welcome 
to the Boomtown" even made the Top 40. 
</P>
<P>
For one bright and shining moment, they were Southern California's golden boys, 
these retiring, cynical sorts who were out of focus on their own album cover. 
</P>
<P>
With "Boomtown," singer/lyricist Baerwald emerged as a primary colorizer of 
Angeleno Angst, writing about materialism and love gone sour in the sun with 
the bitter twists of a Randy Newman but also the populist sympathy of a Bruce 
Springsteen. He was a chronicler of the downside of the dream -- a dream that, 
ironically enough, came true for David + David. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to remember, all that stuff that happened to us was a total fluke. 
Everything happened by accident, the way we got signed and the way the record 
took off. It was a complete shock to our systems. We were like babes in the 
woods." 
</P>
<P>
Once they began to fall out, it might not have been any big deal to the two 
Davids -- they'd never counted on a successful recording career as a duo in the 
first place -- had it not been a big deal to A&amp;M Records, which had a vital 
interest in a second David + David album. The hopeful cajoling from outside 
didn't help bring them together as they tried tensely and in vain to 
collaborate again. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a good way to make music, with a bunch of people breathing down your 
neck. The whole reason to do it is gone then. Unless (the record company) were 
completely out to lunch, which God knows is possible, they must've known that 
all was not totally well in Dave-land." 
</P>
<P>
They finally found out, as all negotiating efforts fell apart. Now David is 
minus David: Baerwald has just released his first solo album, "Bedtime 
Stories." 
</P>
<P>
None of its material would have sounded out of place on "Boomtown." Certainly 
Baerwald's cynicism about the possibilities of love among the ruins remains 
intact. His skepticism about the efforts of do-gooders, from the left wing to 
Bernhard Goetz, is surpassed only by his skepticism about the value of the 
entertainment industry in American life. As he sings in "Liberty Lies," which 
looks both at social problems and the Pollyanna-ish solutions offered for them: 
</P>
<P>
It's like I'm walking through Rome 
</P>
<P>
 Tenements all torn apart 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of Nero 
</P>
<P>
 We got Madonna 
</P>
<P>
 She's fiddling with herself 
</P>
<P>
This quasi-apocalyptic satire sounds remarkably close in tone to a screenplay 
he's been writing with actor Sean Penn. Based loosely around the "Boomtown" LP, 
the Baerwald/Penn script has a straight central story -- set around 
self-obsessed characters trying desperately to make it in the modeling industry 
-- surrounded by bizarre futuristic details, including a literal right-wing war 
on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Penn called the singer after first hearing "Boomtown" and suggested writing a 
movie around its characters. They've been working on it "off and on, in-between 
divorces and records and movies" -- and near-nervous breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Baerwald, 29, hasn't been through a divorce himself, unless you count David + 
David. He and Ricketts, 36, are obviously on good terms now -- "I think we're 
actually better friends now than we ever were," he says -- but for a while the 
situation was tense enough that the differences, as they say in the divorce 
trade, seemed irreconcilable. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble started, Baerwald says, when their only tour came to a close and 
Ricketts went off to produce an album for his ex-girlfriend, Toni Childs, for 
what was to be six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, two years later, he was still in the studio," remembers his partner, 
still acting the part of the neglected lover. "By that time I was really ticked 
off. I had all kinds of songs for another album." 
</P>
<P>
Tired of waiting for Ricketts, Baerwald planned a solo project, but was turned 
down by A&amp;M on the basis that it would "interfere with the marketing of 
David + David. . . . So I couldn't do anything. I was forced to sit around for 
two years going gradually insane." 
</P>
<P>
In the creative process, Baerwald relies on collaborators like Ricketts or 
"Bedtime's" producer Larry Klein to act as controlling supervisor while he 
becomes a loose cannon. "I have no discipline. I have the attention span of a 
gnat or Dan Quayle or something. I need help; I need a grown-up to pump into." 
</P>
<P>
Waiting for Ricketts, with no supervisors to channel his instincts, Baerwald 
slid into a depression. 
</P>
<P>
"I was so infuriated that it was hard to communicate. I was so rankled by this 
feeling of imprisonment that I had. Because I had moved to this horrible little 
apartment next to the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, whose only attraction was 
that it was convenient in relation to Dave. 
</P>
<P>
"That whole period was a descent into hell. Sitting around in that room, I 
started getting all these obsessions -- weird fixations on cops and 
international terrorism and the drug trade and the educational system and 
television." 
</P>
<P>
Too much leisure time in a bad atmosphere left Baerwald dazed and jaded. He was 
dating a woman in the movie industry, associating with prime film stock by 
night; by day, he was befriending "alcoholic policemen" he'd met while his 
buddy Penn was working on the movie "Colors," vicariously soaking up their 
experiences on the street. He became a queasy onlooker to both the most sordid 
and glamorous sides of Hollywood -- "and I still don't know which is which . . 
. frankly." 
</P>
<P>
Finally he moved out of the city "because everywhere I looked, I saw things 
falling apart. If we were sitting here at a table just like this, I would see 
you as slowly dying. I'd look at children playing on the street and think that 
soon they would also die. Everything seemed like a symbol of death. 
</P>
<P>
"I started reading a lot of Genet and Beckett and Sartre, just because it 
seemed obvious that it was some kind of existential crisis that I was 
undergoing," he says, chuckling. "I didn't know what constituted identity. I'd 
lost an understanding of what the self is. I felt completely interchangeable 
with everybody, and everybody became interchangeable with each other, even 
though I knew intellectually that's just not true." 
</P>
<P>
And how did he face off his existential conundrum? A 12-step support program? A 
religious conversion? Nothing any more inspirational to report than some heavy 
sublimation. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I recovered a sense of identity to a certain level. Mostly, though, I 
just ran away. I thought, 'Maybe when I grow up I can deal with it. These are 
questions that nobody can answer, so give yourself a break and don't even try 
right now. Just write down what happens and put it in a form that's 
understandable and sing it and move on and forget about it. Because otherwise 
you're gonna go nuts.' I mean, look at Samuel Beckett, man; what a wreck." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, some of the love songs on "Bedtime Stories" are much more up-front 
and less dark than those on "Boomtown," without so many of the sly, bitter, 
Newmanesque twists that crept into even the happier sounding tracks on the 
previous album. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I was reacting against my feelings. I was using this record to cheer 
myself up. I wanted to do happy stuff. I wanted to find hope in that. 
</P>
<P>
"Say a guy has been married for a long time and his marriage crumbles. And he 
sits around and the ashtrays fill up and mold grows on the beer can, and 
finally one day he just says, 'I know I feel bad, but I'm gonna get up and I'm 
gonna clean this house and paint it and I'm gonna mow the lawn and put 
everything in its place.' And even though he still feels like crap, the act of 
doing these things makes him stronger. That's kind of what I was doing."

<P>
CAIN DAVIS DOGGEDLY KEPT OAKWOOD TEEN FACILITY ALIVE AS HE EVOLVED INTO KEEPER 
OF PEACE ON THE STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his 27 years in Venice, Cain Davis has seen them come and go. Mostly go. 
</P>
<P>
Police, politicians and business people have passed through the community on 
their way to bigger precincts, higher offices or better jobs, says the director 
of the Venice Teen Post. 
</P>
<P>
But a few things remain unchanged. The Oakwood section of Venice is still 
staggering under the burdens of poverty, crime and drug abuse. And there is 
still a Venice Teen Post trying to make things a little bit better. 
</P>
<P>
So Davis says you can't blame him for being a little skeptical when another 
short timer -- President George Bush -- passed through town one day this May. 
Bush visited Oakwood to present an award to a community activist who led a 
community fight against gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the only reason Bush came to the area," Davis told a reporter, "was 
because it was convenient for him since he was on his way to a luncheon in 
Bel-Air." 
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old son of an Arkansas cotton farmer prides himself on not just 
passing through. For more than a quarter-century, Davis has lived and worked in 
the Venice area and in a profession, social work, that seemingly fell out of 
vogue years ago. Davis has doggedly kept the Venice Teen Post open, even as the 
150-post network that once blanketed the county has been reduced to just six. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Davis has evolved into more than just the director of the Teen 
Post, becoming an ombudsman for much of the community -- helping residents cut 
through red tape to get government benefits, resolving disputes with the Los 
Angeles Police Department and generally trying to keep the peace. 
</P>
<P>
Davis had just graduated from Santa Monica High School in 1965 when he took a 
job as assistant director of the Beethoven Teen Post in Mar Vista. 
</P>
<P>
That summer, Los Angeles suffered through the Watts riots. Thousands of 
idealistic young people were answering the call from President Lyndon B. 
Johnson to help fight the nation's War on Poverty. And the Economic Opportunity 
Act was providing nearly $1 million for a six-week summer youth program at 120 
locations around Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The funding was renewed and the program expanded to 150 centers, serving 20,000 
teen-agers. The centers were later named Teen Posts. 
</P>
<P>
Federal money was so abundant in those early years that social workers like 
Davis were told to spend all they could or the money would have to be returned 
to the federal Treasury, recalls William Elkins, then director of the Teen 
Posts and now special assistant to Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
"We had more money than we knew what to do with," said Davis, who became 
director of the Venice Teen Post in 1971. "We don't have that problem any 
more." 
</P>
<P>
In their early days, Teen Posts sponsored a 10-week summer leadership program 
for disadvantaged youths, featuring fitness training, black and Latino history 
and visits by distinguished guests. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once addressed 
the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
There were a host of other special programs, including one that bused youths 
from Teen Posts to local dentists for free checkups. 
</P>
<P>
But a combination of budget cuts and closures of posts that were deemed 
ineffective reduced the network of Teen Posts to 50 by 1968. That slipped to 40 
posts by 1972 and 25 by 1974. Today, six Teen Posts remain. 
</P>
<P>
It costs an average of about $75,000 to run each of the remaining centers, 
including rent, utilities, supplies and salaries for a director and assistant 
director, said Raphael (Ray) Harris, the director of the local teen post 
program, which is funded almost entirely through government grants. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't leave much room for the unexpected. So Davis said he will spend 
his own money to resurface two pool tables or buy a "boom box" to provide music 
in the weight room. 
</P>
<P>
Davis and the other Teen Post employees are "heroes" for staying with the 
program, Elkins said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not many of them left," said Elkins, who was director of the Teen 
Posts from 1967 until 1972. "They don't get enough credit. Why? Because that is 
not where the priorities of the government or the people are in this period of 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is tragic," he said. "The pendulum has swung the other way. There 
is a belief that law enforcement can do it all. And it can't." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said the optimism of the early years was fine, but now he just tries to 
be pragmatic. He knows he can't save every child in the Oakwood. But he said he 
tries to provide a place for them to spend time and stay out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids have no place to go," Davis said. "If they had more Teen Posts, I'm quite 
sure they wouldn't have as many kids on the street as they do now." 
</P>
<P>
On streets like West Washington Boulevard -- where the Teen Post makes its home 
-- the poverty of Venice is brought into sharp focus. Down-and-outers come 
elbow-to-elbow with the Westside's moneyed elite on a street where thrift shops 
stand alongside chi-chi restaurants and boarded-up homes face trendy boutiques. 
</P>
<P>
The battered red storefront at 1100 W. Washington Blvd. has been the Teen 
Post's home since 1971. The pool tables and a Ping-Pong table dominate the main 
room. Books and two televisions line the walls, along with pictures of Mayor 
Bradley and Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
The furnishings are a hodgepodge, but neat and clean. 
</P>
<P>
In back is the popular weight room, where most of the teen-agers on this summer 
day are spending their time. 
</P>
<P>
The Teen Post is also home to the Pearl White Theater for the Performing Arts, 
a community theater sponsored by actor Beau Bridges that produces plays that 
are written and performed by neighborhood children. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he has learned in his 25 years working with teen-agers that 
providing activities is much more effective than preaching. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm concerned about what they do on the street," he said. "But once you have 
told them once what's right, there's not much more you can do." 
</P>
<P>
The Teen Post is open from 1 to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, but Davis is on 
the job 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
To supplement his $21,600 yearly salary as Teen Post director, he works 
mornings as a security aide at Venice High School. And when he is at home in 
Mar Vista, his phone can ring at any hour of the night. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of months ago, the family of a local teen-ager called for help with 
funeral arrangements. Their son had been shot to death in front of a Mar Vista 
bowling alley, and they were not sure how they would pay for his burial. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he solved the problem with a phone call to a Los Angeles funeral 
home that has often helped him by providing its services at a reasonable rate. 
</P>
<P>
When a Venice family said earlier this year that their 27-year-old son had been 
beaten up by officers from a special Los Angeles Police Department anti-gang 
unit, Davis led a contingent to the LAPD's Pacific Division, where they 
discussed the problem with Capt. John Wilbanks. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said that Wilbanks agreed to talk to officials in the Community Resources 
Against Street Hoodlums unit. Wilbanks was out of town last week and could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the phone was ringing again -- the call was from a Venice woman 
desperately trying to keep custody of three children who had been left homeless 
when their mother, a drug addict, died suddenly. The local woman was a friend 
of the deceased and thought she could keep the children together and provide 
better care than the county's overburdened foster care system. 
</P>
<P>
Davis agreed and said he would call county Supervisor Deane Dana's office to 
see if the county will relinquish custody of the children. 
</P>
<P>
Between the Teen Post, his mornings at Venice High and long nights on the 
phone, Davis, who is single, is seldom off the job. But despite the long hours 
and low pay, he said, he never thinks of quitting. 
</P>
<P>
"I know everyone in Venice," Davis said. "The community out there is just like 
my home."

<P>
STUNTWOMAN RAMPE ENJOYS HER LIFE ON THE WILD SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Suzanne Rampe used to spend her free time doing relatively safe things. She'd 
pound volleyballs against shiny gym floors, kick a ball on a neatly groomed 
soccer field or ride the waves in front of her house on The Strand in Hermosa 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Those were the good old days. Now the Mira Costa High graduate spends most of 
her time risking her life. She flips from trampolines, dives from buildings and 
runs around in flames. On weekends she goes to a "secret location" in Carson to 
practice 180-degree turns in a car traveling at high speeds. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the driving," Rampe said. "I like to throw the cars around. It's the 
most exciting." 
</P>
<P>
For those who haven't picked up on it, Rampe, who played volleyball at El 
Camino College and USC, is an athlete turned Hollywood stuntwoman. 
</P>
<P>
Her stunt training includes precision driving, fire, high falls, fencing, rock 
climbing, horses, stair falls, motorcycles, fights and water work. 
</P>
<P>
A diverse athletic background has helped Rampe in her profession, which like 
sports, can be enjoyable but is also physically and mentally demanding. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun, but it's also a big challenge," said the 5-foot-8, 130-pound Rampe. 
"It's definitely not easy." 
</P>
<P>
As a youth Rampe, 26, played Little League baseball and soccer. At Mira Costa, 
she competed in volleyball, soccer, swimming and track. At 16, Rampe won the 
American Surfing Assn. women's national title in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
After that she was part of El Camino's 1981 state champion volleyball team. Her 
postseason performance as a setter and hitter earned her most-valuable-player 
honors in the state tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Former El Camino volleyball Coach Charleen Zartman remembers Rampe as a great, 
all-around player with excellent physical conditioning and a superior 
fundamental base. 
</P>
<P>
"She could do anything under pressure," said Zartman, who led the Warriors to 
nine league titles and two state championships. "She was a great clutch hitter 
and a smart hitter when it came down to the winning point. 
</P>
<P>
"All the other girls had a hard time performing under pressure, but not Suzie. 
When the pressure was on she would really shine." 
</P>
<P>
After a season at El Camino, Rampe walked on at USC as a setter and hitter. A 
solid performance as a sophomore earned Rampe a scholarship for the remainder 
of her college career. 
</P>
<P>
It was during Christmas break of her sophomore season, in 1982, that Rampe was 
introduced to her dare-devil profession. Her mother, who died shortly after 
Rampe began stunt work, got her into the business. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom used to talk to everyone who used to sit in front of our house on The 
Strand to watch the sunset," Rampe said. "One day there was a guy sitting there 
and my mom just started talking to him. It turned out he was a stunt 
coordinator and my mom said 'my daughter would really like to do that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after that, Rampe got her first job doing minor stunts in a B movie 
called "Lovelines." She was thrown over a table and was a passenger in an 
all-terrain vehicle that crashed through a garage door. 
</P>
<P>
"I really enjoyed it, but I knew I needed a lot of training," Rampe said. "I 
knew I had to learn the technical things." 
</P>
<P>
Rampe said she received her best training from Greg Elam, a Carson-based 
stuntman who recently played Eddie Murphy's double in "Another 48 Hours." For 
about a month, she practiced various stunts with Elam at different Carson 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
Now she's working with fellow stuntman Scott Leva on acrobatic high falls, a 
difficult stunt few women have mastered. 
</P>
<P>
The fall, which includes a lot of flipping and turning in the air, is supposed 
to look like it's out of control. Leva, a stuntman of 12 years, said it is 
tough to learn, but that Rampe is making great progress. 
</P>
<P>
"She's got a lot of talent," he said. "She picks things up real quick and she's 
very good." 
</P>
<P>
Leva, a former gymnast, believes car stunts are Rampe's specialty although he 
said "she definitely knows her stuff with burns." 
</P>
<P>
"She's wonderful with cars," he said. "She can put a car on the mark all the 
time. She can do a reverse 180 and come out real clean every time. She really 
handles the car like a pro." 
</P>
<P>
Rampe said cars are fun, but burning is prestigious since only a handful of 
those in the business will do it. 
</P>
<P>
"I told myself when I first got started, 'I will never do fire. Whoever does 
that is crazy!' 
</P>
<P>
"But my former boyfriend specialized in it and a movie came up that had an 
actress with my build." 
</P>
<P>
She took the job and she's been on fire since. The USC Drama major has 
performed in 16 movies and more than 10 television shows. She played Meg Ryan's 
double in "Joe Vs. The Volcano," she fell into a pit in "Fletch Lives" starring 
Chevy Chase and she was involved in a bar-room brawl in "Another 48 Hours," 
starring Murphy and Nick Nolte. 
</P>
<P>
Rampe said she received a beating in "Joe Vs. The Volcano." A boat similar to 
the one used in the movie was put in large tank of water on the set and waves 
were created. Rampe said she got smashed repeatedly against the boat by the 
powerful fake waves. 
</P>
<P>
But her most difficult stunt was in "American Gladiators," a syndicated, weekly 
television show featuring intense, obstacle course-like competitions among 
athletic contestants. 
</P>
<P>
"That was rougher than any stunt job I've ever done," she said. "I was 
exhausted after that." 
</P>
<P>
Rampe's scariest job was filming a television commercial for Italian tennis 
wear. In it she had to play tennis with another stuntman on top of an 18-wheel 
truck while it traveled 30 miles per hour on a rough Arizona dirt road. 
</P>
<P>
"My legs started shaking," Rampe said. "You have to preplan everything. You 
have to plan for what can happen and still go out and do it. That's where the 
professionalism comes in." 
</P>
<P>
Rampe said she's lucky she hasn't suffered any major injuries while performing 
her hazardous duties. She's seen fellow stuntmen break limbs and get badly 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
So far she jammed a wrist doing the high fall in "Fletch Lives" and she 
received a minor burn doing a partial-burn stunt in a scene where she played a 
zombie. 
</P>
<P>
"That day I had a feeling something would go wrong," she said. "It was weird 
that I had that feeling. It's like I knew." 
</P>
<P>
The scene called for Rampe to go backwards while a large fan pushed the flames 
back. Apparently the fan wasn't strong enough and the flames got out of 
control. She said the result was "like a typical little sunburn on my face." 
</P>
<P>
Her latest project is a fight scene in "Heat Wave," a cable television movie 
about the 1965 Watts' riots. Rampe, a member of the Stuntwoman's Assn., does 
about 18 jobs a year. She has an agent who books her for commercials, but she's 
on her own when it comes to movies. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to go out to sets around town and hustle work," she said.

80 YEARS AGO, THE TRUTH HURT; 
</P>
<P>
JOHNSON'S VICTORY OVER JEFFRIES TAUGHT LESSON TO WHITE AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eighty years ago, promoter Tex Rickard staged a fight in Reno between a black 
champion and a white challenger and called it "The Fight of the Century." 
</P>
<P>
He may have been right. 
</P>
<P>
The event, and a nation's reaction to it, showed vividly what America was at 
the time and where it was going. On a sunny, hot afternoon, Rickard matched the 
champion, Jack Johnson, and Jim Jeffries. 
</P>
<P>
The July 4 bout shocked white America into the reality that white supremacy was 
a myth. And a dead one at that. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's victory over Jeffries provided a lesson much of white America didn't 
learn gracefully. Johnson-Jeffries touched off America's first national race 
riot -- several days of hundreds of violent street clashes between whites and 
blacks in cities across the country. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of July 4 alone, eight died in street fights. 
</P>
<P>
But Jack Johnson's victory that day did nothing to open the door of opportunity 
for black athletes or black Americans generally. If anything, it shut it even 
tighter. More than a decade later, white heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey 
refused to fight a black, Harry Wills. And it was 37 more years before blacks 
were permitted to play major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Films of Jack Johnson's easy victory shown in theaters touched off even more 
rioting. So violent was the reaction that Congress enacted legislation in 1912 
banning the interstate transportation of boxing films, a law not repealed until 
1940. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Johnson in 1910 was probably the most hated man in white America, in part 
because of his apparent lack of concern that many whites hated him. Always, the 
gold-toothed smile seemed to mock the tenets of the day, which had it that 
blacks should defer to whites. And above all, a black man should never even 
look at a white woman, much less marry one. Jack Johnson married three white 
women. 
</P>
<P>
In 1908, he became the heavyweight champion in Sydney, when police stopped his 
bout against another outclassed white champion, Tommy Burns of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Among the writers covering that fight was the young novelist, Jack London. His 
syndicated story was crafted along racial lines. And his closing paragraph, 
read by millions, was almost a call to arms. 
</P>
<P>
"But one thing now remains," London wrote. "Jim Jeffries must emerge from his 
alfalfa farm and remove the golden smile from Jack Johnson's face. Jeff, it's 
up to you!" 
</P>
<P>
Jeffries, the retired white heavyweight champion, was happy and fat in 
retirement on his Burbank alfalfa farm. 
</P>
<P>
At first, Jeffries refused all who begged him to return to boxing. He had 
retired unbeaten in 1904 and by mid-1909 weighed 314 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Jeffries was ground down by the pressure of white racists and a 
guaranteed $120,000 offer by Rickard, plus perhaps close to $1 million more . . 
. if he won. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE NATION 
</P>
<P>
In 1910, when blacks made up 10.7% of the population, 76 people were lynched in 
the United States, 67 of them blacks. Between 1885 and 1910, there were 3,287 
U.S. victims of lynchings, 2,276 of them blacks. 
</P>
<P>
In Charleston, Mo., on the day before the Johnson-Jeffries fight, a mob of a 
thousand whites broke through the door of the city jail with a battering ram, 
dragged two blacks accused of having murdered a white farmer from their cells 
and hanged them. 
</P>
<P>
In 1916, per capita annual expenditures for education in southern states 
averaged $10.32 for white children, $2.89 for black children. In 1900, 728 of 
the nation's 114,703 lawyers were black. 
</P>
<P>
In 1896, in Plessy vs. Ferguson, the Supreme Court upheld segregation laws in 
public transportation. At the time, there were few places in America where 
blacks were permitted in hotels, theaters, churches, schools or trains occupied 
by whites without being restricted to the "colored" section. 
</P>
<P>
In 1907, the Supreme Court upheld the right of railroads to segregate 
passengers on interstate trips, even when such segregation ran counter to the 
laws of the states in which the train was traveling. 
</P>
<P>
In 1909, film shorts titled "Sambo" and "Rastus," in which blacks were depicted 
as childlike and incompetent, soared to huge popularity after their New York 
debut. 
</P>
<P>
In boxing and some other sports, blacks and whites participated somewhat 
equally. In the 1875 Kentucky Derby, for example, 14 of the 15 jockeys were 
black. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, it seems scarcely to have caused a ripple that in boxing's lighter 
weight classes there were black champions such as George Dixon, Joe Walcott and 
Joe Gans dating to the late 19th Century. But starting with 1880s heavyweight 
king John L. Sullivan -- who refused to fight prominent heavyweight Peter 
Jackson because he was black -- a tradition began of denying blacks opportunity 
to win the heavyweight title. 
</P>
<P>
As John Lardner wrote it in his 1947 book, "White Hopes and Other Tigers," 
"Race seems to have been an issue only when the scales reached 175 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
Lardner, in his study of the Jack Johnson years, concluded that the 
anti-Johnson faction held to two tenets: That rule of the heavyweight 
championship by a black was somehow a threat to civilization, and that human 
courage and intelligence were directly related to skin color. But to their 
dismay, Johnson's chief asset in the ring was his intelligence. He was not a 
hard puncher, as was Jeffries. Instead, Johnson was cunning -- a brilliant 
defensive fighter who tried to wear down foes by constantly parrying their 
charges, slipping their punches, tiring them and finishing them off in later 
rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Nor did it seem to matter to the anti-Johnson forces that some of the best 
heavyweights of the day were blacks, such as Sam Langford, Joe Jeanette, Sam 
McVey and Harry Wills. They seldom fought whites, and when they did it was 
without the intensity with which they fought one another, because they needed 
friendly promoters to prolong their careers. 
</P>
<P>
But not Jack Johnson. He was an original. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Johnson not only beat white fighters, he humiliated them. He taunted them 
as he beat them, and when he had beaten them, he laughed at them. 
</P>
<P>
And he loved it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE MAN 
</P>
<P>
John Arthur Johnson was the son of a school janitor, born in 1878 in a tiny 
house near the docks and cotton warehouses of Galveston, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
One of nine children, Johnson learned to fight early in his rough-and-tumble 
neighborhood. At 12, he hopped a freight train and lived on the road for five 
years. He traveled across the South, earning change as an exercise rider at 
race tracks and, briefly, as a sponge fisherman in Key West, Fla. Often he went 
days without food. 
</P>
<P>
In his mid-teens, he began showing up at the training camps of prominent black 
fighters and working as a sparring partner. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to Galveston as a 17-year-old and went to work in a paint shop. One 
day, he learned that a circus was coming to Galveston with a carnival fighter 
named Bob Tomlinson, who offered all comers $5 if they could last four rounds 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson knocked him out in the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
He surfaced next in Chicago, earning small purses in club fights. He saw early 
that he had little hope of ever rising to the top levels of boxing because of 
his race. 
</P>
<P>
He drifted west and between 1901 and 1904 fought often in Los Angeles, 
Bakersfield, San Francisco and Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the powerful, hard-hitting Los Angeles heavyweight champion, 
Jeffries, was beating every challenger. He retired with a 20-0 record in 1904. 
</P>
<P>
In 1906 in Los Angeles, Canada's Burns defeated Marvin Hart for the heavyweight 
title. 
</P>
<P>
For two years, Johnson pursued Burns around the United States and Europe, 
pleading for a title bout. Finally, he followed him to Australia, where on Dec. 
26, 1908, in a temporary 16,000-seat outdoor stadium, Johnson was trouncing the 
5-foot-7 Burns when police entered the ring in the 14th round and stopped the 
bout. 
</P>
<P>
To many whites, Johnson's winning the heavyweight championship was bad enough. 
But when he knocked out the popular middleweight champion, Stanley Ketchel, in 
1909, it was the last straw. Actually, it was the way Johnson knocked Ketchel 
out that most angered whites. 
</P>
<P>
The Johnson-Ketchel fight, held at Colma, Calif., was to have been more of an 
exhibition, Johnson later claimed. In man-to-man fighting, the 170 1/2-pound 
Ketchel stood almost no chance against the 205 1/2-pound Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
But Ketchel, with a surprise punch, knocked Johnson down in the 12th round. 
Infuriated, Johnson knocked Ketchel unconscious with a punch that broke several 
of his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
Then, while reporters watched, Johnson gleefully removed some of Ketchel's 
teeth that had become embedded in his right glove. 
</P>
<P>
That was it. Jeffries had to come back. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE CHALLENGER 
</P>
<P>
Jim Jeffries was the son of an evangelist who had brought his family to Los 
Angeles from Carroll, Ohio, in 1882, when the future world heavyweight champion 
was 7. Alexis Jeffries bought 120 acres between what is now Elysian Park and 
the Arroyo Seco and planted 100 acres of orange trees. 
</P>
<P>
The preacher's son grew to be a spectacular physical specimen, even by today's 
standards. In his prime years as champion, Jeffries was 6-feet-2 and 215 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
His strength was legendary. His friends told the story of how Jeffries, as a 
teen, shot a deer in the mountains near Tehachapi, field-dressed it, hoisted it 
over his shoulders and carried it nine miles to a campsite, not once pausing to 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
Jack London described Jeffries' physique this way: "His is a perfection of 
symmetry that is the fruit of the highest organic development." 
</P>
<P>
As a teen-ager, Jeffries worked as a boilermaker at the Lacy Manufacturing Co. 
in Los Angeles, and he later was a miner in Temecula, where he easily held his 
own in foot races, fights and wrestling matches with much older miners. 
</P>
<P>
Almost as a whim, someone matched him with an experienced Los Angeles pro 
boxer, Hank Griffin, in a small arena near Olvera Street. Jeffries, 19, took a 
beating for 13 rounds, but then knocked Griffin out. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1896 and late 1899, Jeffries won 12 fights, most of them in San 
Francisco. In 1897, Jeffries, 22, obtained work as a sparring partner for 
Gentleman Jim Corbett, who was in training for his title fight with Bob 
Fitzsimmons in Carson City, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
In films of that fight, Jeffries is the tall, broad-shouldered young man 
working Corbett's corner. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in November, 1899, Jeffries was matched with heavyweight champion 
Fitzsimmons at Coney Island, N.Y. With several hundred Los Angeles-area 
followers watching, Jeffries won the title on an 11th-round knockout. He 
remains Los Angeles' only world heavyweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
Victories followed over former champions Jim Corbett, twice, and Fitzsimmons in 
a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
Wearying of the training grind and wealthy beyond his dreams, he retired in the 
summer of 1904. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE CITY 
</P>
<P>
The gray sign, shaped liked the state of Nevada, rises out of the sidewalk at 
the corner of East Fourth and Toano streets in Reno. 
</P>
<P>
The sign identifies the site, now a construction materials yard, of "The Fight 
of the Century." 
</P>
<P>
The text notes that San Francisco, not Reno, was first selected by Rickard for 
the fight. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 1, 1909, Johnson and Jeffries signed for the fight at the Albany Hotel 
in New York, where both fighters put up $5,000 good-faith bonds. Rickard had 
beaten five other promoters who had submitted sealed bids for the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Rickard paid each fighter $10,000 at the signing, agreed to pay each $10,000 
more 60 days later and $25,000 each 48 hours before the fight. Later, Rickard 
also paid both fighters bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the promoter drew up the potentially lucrative movie rights deal 
in which he and the fighters each had a one-third interest. 
</P>
<P>
Later, before the fight, a syndicate purchased Johnson's, Jeffries' and 
Rickard's movie rights for $50,000 each. It was a canny move by the fighters 
and Rickard, but a disaster for the syndicate. 
</P>
<P>
Rickard proceeded with construction of an 18,000-seat arena in San Francisco at 
8th and Market streets. He visited banks, using tickets to the fight as 
collateral and borrowed money to buy lumber and pay carpenters. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, religious groups were applying pressure on California Gov. James C. 
Gillett, demanding that he ban the fight in California. 
</P>
<P>
On June 15, he agreed. He threatened to mobilize state National Guard units if 
Rickard proceeded with construction of his arena. 
</P>
<P>
Rickard, with only 19 days until the fight, was frantic. Almost immediately, 
Reno made a bid. 
</P>
<P>
Reno carpenters, 200 of them, quickly put up an 18,000-seat, octagonal wooden 
arena, finishing it two days before the fight. In 1910, Reno's population was 
11,000. It had only two substantial hotels: the Golden, with 200 rooms, and the 
Riverside, with 112. Counting boarding houses, hotels and private homes, one 
reporter calculated there were 2,000 rentable Reno rooms . . . and 100 saloons. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the "half-naked women" of Reno's red-light district, a Times 
reporter wrote: "They pose as candidates for divorce. (But) a man with money 
would have no difficulty if so inclined, to make a feminine annexation, whether 
temporary or permanent." 
</P>
<P>
By June 25, about 300 reporters, the first of 2,000, were already in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Novelist Rex Beach, who covered the fight for The Times and other papers, wrote 
that Reno was "the focal point for all things terrestrial." 
</P>
<P>
The fighters left their Bay Area training camps almost immediately after 
learning of Gov. Gillett's edict. Johnson set up his new training site west of 
Reno, at Rick's Roadhouse, a popular resort. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffries set up shop five miles south of Reno, at Moana Springs, today a city 
park and the site of Reno's minor league baseball stadium. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE FIGHT 
</P>
<P>
Times headline on July 4, 1910: On the Eve of Battle Men Wait Breathless 
</P>
<P>
Films of Reno taken on the day of the fight show a little city's streets and 
sidewalks swarming with excited men in coats, ties and straw hats and smoking 
cigars. Their animated faces show an eager anticipation, particularly those 
scenes photographed at the rail depot, where one special train after another 
disgorged fight fans. 
</P>
<P>
Films taken outside the arena show a long line of ticket-holders moving eagerly 
inside beneath a gate where ticket prices are shown as $50 ringside, down to 
$10 -- monster prices for 1910, when $575 was the average annual wage. 
</P>
<P>
By fight day, scalpers were getting $25 for the $10 seats. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, movie cameramen began cranking as the ring announcer introduced 
celebrities. For the first time, six heavyweight champions, past and present, 
were in one place: Johnson, Jeffries, John L. Sullivan, who covered the fight 
for the New York Times; Corbett, Fitzsimmons and Burns. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, fit at 212 pounds, entered the ring first, at 2:30 p.m., in blue 
trunks. Jeffries wore purple. Both men wore American flag-like belts. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the referee, Tex Rickard, who had first offered the assignment to 
President William Howard Taft. Turned down, he sought British author Sir Arthur 
Conan Doyle. Turned down again, Rickard appointed himself. 
</P>
<P>
Possibly no fighter since Jeffries has surpassed his achievement of driving 
himself back into fighting shape. When he agreed to fight Johnson, he weighed 
314 pounds. Seven months later, at the Reno weigh-in, he came in at 227. 
</P>
<P>
But it didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson was 32 that day and sharp. Jeffries was 35 and hadn't fought for six 
years. Nevertheless, he went off as the 10-7 favorite. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those who bet on Jeffries subscribed to the theory that Johnson had a 
"yellow streak." However, no one could cite a specific instance in which 
Johnson had shown a lack of courage. 
</P>
<P>
Said Burns, talking about his 1908 defeat by Johnson: "(Johnson is) game 
against little fellows like Ketchel and me, but Jeffries is too big and strong. 
He'll bring the yellow streak out." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Johnson beat Jeffries as he pleased, keeping up a running stream of 
conversation with both Jeffries and angry, sullen ringsiders. At one point, in 
the late rounds, in a clinch, Johnson spotted Jeffries' trainer, Farmer Brown, 
and shouted: "Hey, Farm, ever see a champ eat leather? You watch Jeff. He just 
loves to swallow mouthfuls, all day long, don't you, champ?" 
</P>
<P>
With that, Johnson whacked Jeffries in the face again. 
</P>
<P>
In the 15th round, Jeffries was bleeding badly from cuts over an eye and in his 
mouth, and the other eye was nearly swollen shut. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson drove him into a sitting position on the ropes with a flurry of 
punches. When Jeffries got up, Johnson knocked him half through the ropes, on 
his back. He rose shakily again and tried to flee to the other side of the 
ring, where Johnson knocked him down again. 
</P>
<P>
Before Rickard could count him out, Jeffries' corner men rushed into the ring. 
Technically, that disqualified their fighter, but it's still shown in the Ring 
record book as a 15th-round knockout for Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
As Jeffries' manager, Sam Berger, crawled hastily through the ropes, he said to 
Johnson, "No, Jack -- don't hit him anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Immediately, ringside telegraphers began tapping out the news. In the lobby of 
the Hotel Adlon in Berlin, hundreds of Americans gathered at 1:30 a.m. to hear 
bulletins. 
</P>
<P>
In front of The Times building, several thousand gathered to hear telegraphed 
round-by-round bulletins shouted through a megaphone. The New York Times 
reported that 30,000 had gathered in Times Square for a similar presentation of 
the fight. 
</P>
<P>
In Kansas City, 14,000 sat in the city's convention hall to listen to 
bulletins. 
</P>
<P>
At Sagamore Hill, N.Y., according to the Associated Press, former President 
Theodore Roosevelt repeatedly telephoned the nearby telegraph office for a 
fight report. When finally he learned the result, the Associated Press reported 
that the telegraph operator described Roosevelt's reaction as "an exploding 
expletive." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, ringside writers who doubted the abilities of blacks fumbled to 
explain what had happened. They concluded that Jeffries had been the victim of 
inhuman, brute strength. 
</P>
<P>
Beach, who frequently referred to Johnson as "the African" in his stories, 
wrote in his story: "(Johnson) has demonstrated that his race has acquired full 
stature as men. Whether they will ever breed brains to match his muscle is yet 
to be proven." 
</P>
<P>
In the following day's Times, an editorial addressed to blacks stated: "Do not 
point your nose too high. Do not swell your chest too much. Do not boast too 
loudly. Do not be puffed up. Let not your ambitions be inordinate or take a 
wrong direction. Remember you have done nothing at all. You are just the same 
member of society today you were last week. . . . You are on no higher plane, 
deserve no new consideration, and will get none." 
</P>
<P>
Jeffries broke down and wept after the fight, possibly because of the future 
income he had lost. A friend, oilman Clarence Berry, had bet $35,000 on 
Jeffries. But Jeffries lost between $500,000 and $700,000 he would have 
received for a nationwide tour. 
</P>
<P>
A big winner was Australian Hugh McIntosh, who had promoted the Johnson-Burns 
fight in 1908. He won $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
Another big winner was Rickard, who announced a paid attendance of 16,528 -- 
there were about 1,500 gate crashers, he said -- and a gross of $277,775. 
Johnson earned $110,500, Jeffries $127,166, including $50,000 each for their 
film rights. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest losers were the syndicate members who had bought film sale rights 
from Rickard and the fighters. The syndicate was banking on a Jeffries victory, 
film of which would have commanded dollar-a-ticket showings across the nation 
for months. 
</P>
<P>
But after race riots broke out in countless cities after the fight, municipal 
and state governments began banning the film showings. On the morning after the 
fight, along with its fight coverage, The Times published a wire report that 
riots had broken out "in practically every big city in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, 10 people had died in riots in six states. 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the fight, Jeffries said his "old snap" was gone. But two 
days later, on the train from Oakland to Los Angeles, he told a reporter: "I 
couldn't have beaten Johnson on my best day." 
</P>
<P>
Said Johnson: "I outclassed him. He was game . . . but he was only half the 
trouble Burns was." 
</P>
<P>
Grudgingly, almost painfully, some of Jeffries' followers conceded respect for 
Johnson. An AP reporter, describing the the mood after the fight in the arena, 
wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"Hope had lived in thousands of breasts until the last minute, and then their 
idol had crumbled. And this black man stood above them, peerless. They could 
not help but admire him, and there was little animosity shown toward him. For 
the most part, the people were silent, readjusting things in their minds." 
</P>
<P>
As Johnson left the ring and walked down an aisle, the writer reported: "The 
crowd stood and cheered, as much from the pent-up excitement as anything else." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE END 
</P>
<P>
After Johnson lost his heavyweight championship in 1915 to Jess Willard, there 
was not another black champion until Joe Louis won the title in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
Louis, who defended a record 25 times, was instructed early in his career by 
his black manager to conduct himself in and out of the ring in a manner as 
dissimilar to Johnson's as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Poker-faced and seemingly shy, Louis didn't so much as smile when he knocked 
out a white opponent, not even in the most important victories of his career. 
</P>
<P>
After Louis, Johnson receded into history. Since Louis, there have been 14 
undisputed heavyweight champions, 12 of them black. 
</P>
<P>
After Reno, Johnson returned to Chicago and embarked upon a spending spree that 
left him broke within three years. 
</P>
<P>
Reviled before, he was hated even more after his demolition of Jeffries, 
particularly after he married two more white women, his first wife, Etta 
Duryea, having committed suicide in 1912. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government filed trumped-up charges of violating the Mann Act 
against him. The Mann Act was a 1912 federal law making it illegal to transport 
women across state lines "for immoral purposes." He was convicted and sentenced 
to a year in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson fled the United States, disguising himself as a member of a black 
Canadian baseball team. He spent eight years in exile in Europe, South America 
and Tijuana, Mexico, before surrendering to federal authorities in 1920 at the 
U.S.-Mexico border at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson claimed his fight against Willard in Havana was rigged in Willard's 
favor. It was a deal he had made with federal authorities to avoid prison, but 
they double-crossed him, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson served his sentence at Leavenworth and spent the rest of his life 
making public appearances, often on the New York stage. 
</P>
<P>
Lardner found Johnson working at a small New York museum one day in the early 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to call on him at the museum occasionally," Lardner wrote. "He talked 
freely and once he paused, stared at me coldly, and said: 'Just remember, 
whatever you write about me, write that I was a man, and a good one.' " 
</P>
<P>
Johnson died on June 10, 1946, while driving from Texas to New York to attend 
the Joe Louis-Billy Conn title fight. A notoriously reckless driver, Johnson 
lost control of his car on a country highway near Raleigh, N.C. He crashed into 
a power pole and was pronounced dead shortly afterward. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, his funeral was attended by thousands. He was buried at Chicago's 
Graceland Cemetery, beside his first wife. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffries also went broke after Reno, although not as quickly as Johnson. He 
retired with more than $300,000 in 1910 but lost most of his fortune in bad 
mining ventures in Texas, Arizona and Mono County, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
He filed for bankruptcy in 1923, righted himself and later recouped much of his 
fortune by speculating on San Fernando Valley real estate. 
</P>
<P>
He died at 77 in 1953 at his sprawling home at 2422 W. Victory Blvd. in 
Burbank. He left an estate of $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Jeffries is buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery, across the street from the 
Forum.

BILL CULLEN; FIXTURE AS GAME SHOW HOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bill Cullen, genial game show host and panelist who was a popular fixture on 
"I've Got a Secret" and "The Price is Right," died Saturday at his Bel-Air home 
from complications resulting from cancer. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
Cullen died at 5:25 p.m. of heart failure brought on by a months-long battle 
with lung cancer, said George Spota, Cullen's manager. Cullen's wife, Ann, was 
at his bedside when he died. 
</P>
<P>
"He set the standard for how audience participation game shows are done during 
his 42-year career," Spota said. "He never took his career too seriously as a 
star, but he took it very seriously as a professional with responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"Bill did about 25,000 radio and television shows between 1939 and 1988, which 
is when he retired," added Spota, who said a memorial service would be held in 
Los Angeles in about a month. "He retired a champion." 
</P>
<P>
The collegiate looking Cullen, with horn-rimmed glasses and an elfish grin, 
appeared on more than 35 network radio and television programs, beginning as an 
announcer but quickly becoming popular as a master of ceremonies or host. 
</P>
<P>
"I never considered myself a top-flight announcer," he once said. "I'm not an 
actor. . . . But this I can do." 
</P>
<P>
He said he relished the hosting role because "they want me to be myself." 
</P>
<P>
William Lawrence Cullen was born Feb. 18, 1920, in Pittsburgh. When he was 18 
months old, he was stricken with infantile paralysis, which gave him a 
permanent limp and focused his career options. 
</P>
<P>
"Polio moved me out of physical effort," Cullen said, "and forced me into a 
mental manner of living." 
</P>
<P>
Working in his father's garage as a mechanic and tow truck driver, he 
entertained co-workers by imitating local radio announcers. The mimicry 
eventually led to an audition for a job -- as unpaid announcer for tiny radio 
station WWSW in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
He moved to New York in 1944 and quickly profited from the shortage of network 
personnel caused by the war. 
</P>
<P>
Within a week, Cullen was hired by CBS as a staff radio announcer. 
</P>
<P>
Cullen shied away from television as it emerged, fearing his physical handicap 
would mar his success. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1952, he agreed to appear as a panelist on "I've Got a Secret," where 
the panel remained seated. He remained on the show as panelist or host for its 
entire 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving CBS to free lance, by 1954 Cullen was on three national television 
programs and two network radio shows. 
</P>
<P>
Cullen was named host of "The Price is Right," in which panelists chosen from 
the studio audience tried to guess the price of luxury prizes. The show 
survived charges of corruption which ended many giveaway programs in 1958, and 
ran successfully from 1956 to 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Maintaining an exhausting pace, Cullen in the late 1950s was on the air 25 
hours and 30 minutes each week -- more time than the storied Arthur Godfrey at 
the peak of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Among the game shows hosted by Cullen other than his best-known "The Price is 
Right" and "I've Got a Secret," were: "The Joker's Wild," "The Love Experts," 
"Name that Tune," "Pass the Buck," "Place the Face," "Quick as a Flash," "Three 
on a Match," "The $25,000 Pyramid," "Winner Take All," and "Winning Streak." 
</P>
<P>
He was a regular panelist on "To Tell the Truth," "Where Was I?" and "You're 
Putting Me On."

FROM THE SYNAGOGUE TO A 'CRUSH' THAT TURNED WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE INTO AN 
OBSESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's a nice Jewish boy like Ben Donenberg doing with a crush on William 
Shakespeare? 
</P>
<P>
"Shakespeare is my obsession," admits the actor-turned-entrepreneur. "I don't 
care if he really existed or not; I just love his plays." Under Donenberg's 
artistic directorship, Shakespeare Festival/LA has set out to spread that 
sentiment throughout Los Angeles; this weekend it launches a fifth season of 
free performances beginning at Hollywood's John Anson Ford Amphitheater 
(through July 14), followed by a July 18 to 28 run at Citicorp Plaza downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"It started around eight years ago," recalled Donenberg, 33, who trained as an 
actor at Juilliard. "I was playing a valet in 'Amadeus' on Broadway, and after 
about four months of moving furniture, I started needing a creative outlet." 
The idea of a community theater company was still bubbling in 1983 when he 
moved to Los Angeles to pursue a master's degree in philosophy at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking back at the Greeks -- 2,500 years ago, when Athens was a lot 
like Los Angeles," he said. "All the fields were just starting to develop -- 
business, commerce, art, mathematics -- and I think as people began to 
individuate themselves in these pursuits, they looked for ways to connect, to 
create community: 'Although we have different interests, we're still alike.' 
That's what the original Greek theater festivals must have been like: free, 
outdoors, and everybody attended." 
</P>
<P>
For Donenberg (whose space-age spoof "Starship Shakespeare" was a 1985 hit at 
Al's Bar downtown), that sense of community began in his native Skokie, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
"I hung out a lot at the synagogue as a child," he said. "My father died when I 
was very young, so becoming religious, was, I guess, a way of repairing the 
damage. I used to sit in the synagogue listening to the rabbi give his sermons 
and think, 'This is great.' But even though it was a noble thing -- to raise 
people's ethical and moral way of living -- there's a whole world out there 
that isn't Jewish; there should be a way of doing it that cuts across 
religion." 
</P>
<P>
The step into theater was a short one. "I was in the Hebrew school plays; I 
played Queen Esther with a wig on," he said with a chuckle, remembering an 
all-male production. "One time, we were given an extra credit assignment if we 
watched Olivier's 'Hamlet' on TV and wrote a report about it. I didn't 
understand much except that Hamlet's father died and came back as a ghost. I 
said, 'Hey, I can identify with that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Although he pursued acting steadily (including two summers at the National 
Shakespeare Conservatory in Woodstock, N.Y.), "It gradually became apparent to 
me that, although I had talent, the world didn't really need another great 
actor. What it needed was more people to create playgrounds for them to play 
in." Intuitively, he turned to Ira Gershwin's widow (for whom he'd been editing 
George and Ira's scrapbooks) and asked for her help in starting a community 
Shakespeare festival. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a Cinderella story," he said happily. Recalling that Citicorp had 
sponsored New York's Shakespeare in the Park, he picked up the phone book and 
called Citicorp. "I said, 'I have a little bit of help from Mrs. Gershwin, will 
you help?' and they said, 'Sure.' You know how people scramble around to raise 
money? Citicorp said, 'Come in right now, we want to talk to you.' They were 
new in town and wanted something they could be identified with -- and they've 
been a major funder ever since." 
</P>
<P>
Donenberg's first festival site was Pershing Square in the heart of downtown. 
At his urging, the Community Redevelopment Agency got on board -- as did Actors 
Equity, with whom he negotiated special contracts for his players, "because I 
don't think anybody should work for free." Shakespeare Festival/LA now also 
boasts a full-time, 14-member board of directors, additional corporate 
sponsorship and a new educational program for children. 
</P>
<P>
This year, "Shakespearience!" has traveled to elementary schools with a puppet 
adaptation of "A Midsummer Night's Dream." "We also send out a dance instructor 
who teaches the kids the Elizabethan Washerwoman's Brawl -- expose them to 
music and dance, costumes, Shakespeare's words. An actor pretends he's 
Shakespeare and talks about what it was like to live then." 
</P>
<P>
This summer, the main stage fare is "Much Ado About Nothing," a comedy, said 
the show's director Kevin Kelley, "that's very much about appearances -- very 
appropriate today in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the plots in the play have to do with the danger of denying true 
feelings for appearance's sake," added Kelley, who believes that "Much Ado's" 
inherent seriousness is often overlooked. "People wear masks of wit, social 
decorum, egotism. It's also about the privileged segments of society and the 
quality of language." He has set the play on a tony American island retreat in 
1932, and scored it with jazz of the day. 
</P>
<P>
Despite quality production values and professional actors, all plays are 
presented free. (Attendees are asked to bring a can of non-perishable goods for 
the needy; last year, a matching gift from Vons netted $40,000 worth of donated 
foodstuff.) "We want to be accessible and available to whoever wants to 
attend," Donenberg says. 
</P>
<P>
Proud though he is of the rapid rise of the Festival (no relation to the 
now-defunct L.A. Free Shakespeare Festival), Donenberg is still hustling for 
bigger and better. He's negotiating with USC for its 1,600-seat Embassy Theatre 
downtown; just this year, he began drawing a regular paycheck. All that 
activity leaves little time for a personal life. Even mom has stopped praying 
for him to find the perfect wife: "At this point, she says, 'Will you just find 
someone, please?" 
</P>
<P>
"Establishing a theatrical tradition is very difficult," he acknowledged. "It 
is an uphill battle. The paper work is oppressive; we're understaffed, 
overworked. I don't feel like I'm sacrificing -- really. It's more like I'm 
trading off. The trade-off is personal comforts for the feeling that comes from 
knowing you've helped culturally enrich your community, created a place where 
people from all walks of life can sit and breathe and laugh and cry together. 
When you see the reward, it's always worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Much Ado About Nothing" plays at 7:30 tonight, Friday and Saturday at the 
John Anson Ford Amphitheater, 2580 Cahuenga Blvd. East in Hollywood, and at 
Citicorp Plaza, 725 S. Figueroa Ave., at 6:45 p.m. July 18 to 28 (free 
parking). In lieu of an admission charge, donations of canned food for the 
needy will be accepted. General admission tickets are available at all Music 
Plus outlets and Ticketmaster locations in May Co. department stores. For 
membership information: (213) 489-1121.

"I've avoided seeing this work installed all together like this because it's 
sort of overwhelming for me," says Tim Rollins of "Amerika I -- XII," a series 
of sprawling collaborative paintings conceived and executed by Rollins and 
K.O.S. (Kids of Survival), an art collective of learning-disabled students from 
the South Bronx. "It makes me feel hurt and happy at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Standing in one of the vast chambers of the DIA Foundation, a cavernous 
industrial art space in Lower Manhattan where the paintings were on view, he 
gazes around the room with a slightly wounded look on his face. Though Rollins 
has been immersed in this work since 1984, when he and his evolving crew of 10 
to 15 students began the series of mixed-media paintings inspired by Franz 
Kafka's unifinished novel "Amerika," he still finds them deeply moving. 
</P>
<P>
And, "Amerika I -- XII" which goes on view today at the Museum of Contemporary 
Art in Los Angeles, is indeed a remarkable and powerful achievement. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Rollins was a 26-year-old artist forced to take a teaching job to 
support his art career. Working at I.S. 52 in the South Bronx, he was 
exasperated by a school system that was failing miserably to either educate or 
inspire students, who looked to the South Bronx drug trade as their main career 
opportunity. Most of his students' parents were divorced, many of the students 
were dyslexic, and their familiarity with art was limited to the graffiti that 
covers the South Bronx like an angry rash. 
</P>
<P>
Rollins' improbably idealistic response to this bleak situation was to form 
K.O.S. and the Art and Knowledge Workshop. The goal, says Rollins "was to make 
great art and to make history," and he's succeeded beyond his wildest dreams. 
The artwork they've produced has garnered glowing reviews and collectors have 
eagerly forked over the $150,000 required to own a K.O.S. piece. They're 
represented by the trend-setting Jay Gorney Gallery in New York, and the Museum 
of Modern Art has acquired works for its permanent collection, as have Charles 
Saatchi and other taste-making collectors around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Wealthy admirers are lining up to help finance Rollins' next project, The South 
Bronx Academy of Fine Art, a fully accredited school that would make art the 
core of its curriculum. The K.O.S. kids travel the world as visiting artists 
and lecturers, rubbing elbows with art world heavyweights. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to pinch myself that we're in this position and the work is still 
getting better," says the indefatigably upbeat Rollins as he launches into the 
K.O.S. story. 
</P>
<P>
"Most artists who teach have their art in one pocket and teaching in the other, 
and they only teach to support the art practice," says Rollins, a former 
Conceptualist who studied with Joseph Kosuth and was a founder of the artists 
collective Group Material. "But I fell in love with the kids, so I decided to 
combine the two practices and started making art with the kids. None of us knew 
what we were doing in the beginning, but we ignored the obvious problems and 
just plowed ahead with the faith that the problems would solve themselves -- 
which they did. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning the only materials we had were Xerox paper that I stole from 
other departments and cheap pencils," he continues, "but things exploded once 
we got our studio, which we paid for with a matching grant from the (National 
Endowment for the Arts). They were the only agency that took an interest in us 
then, and I'm ever indebted to the NEA. I can't believe people want to attack 
it and bring it down, because it's essential for projects like ours." 
</P>
<P>
As pivotal as the support they received from the NEA, was the day that group 
member Carlos Rivera did a drawing on the sly on the pages of one of Rollins' 
books. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to kill him at first," Rollins recalls, "but it looked really great. 
And, I was blown away by the fact that here was this dyslexic kid who had 
captured the essence of the book in a drawing on the book." 
</P>
<P>
Rollins had been searching for a way to involve his students with the written 
word, and thus was born K.O.S.' stylistic trademark: They cover large canvases 
with the pages of whatever book they're working with. The pages 
</P>
<P>
serve as the ground for the painting, which doesn't exactly illustrate the 
book; rather, the images represent ideas the students have extrapolated from 
the book and interpreted in terms of their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
Previous series have been based on "Moby Dick," "The Scarlet Letter," "Journal 
of the Plague Year" and "The Metamorphosis," among other works of classical 
literature. The "Amerika" series, however, is the jewel in the K.O.S. crown. 
Kafka's only comic novel, "Amerika" is a dreamy portrait of a country Kafka 
longed to visit but never saw, and the book can be interpreted as wishful 
autobiography. Centering on the misadventures of Karl, an ill-fated immigrant 
who finally finds shelter from the storms of life when he stumbles into the 
welcoming embrace of the Nature Theater of Oklahoma, the book is essentially 
the story of the redemption of an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
"An underlying theme in all our work is the alienated individual and the need 
for alienated individuals to come together to make something new -- and that 
idea is certainly central to this book," observes Rollins. 
</P>
<P>
"Amerika's" unifying form is a horn shape that refers to the golden trumpets 
that greet Karl when he first encounters the Nature Theater of Oklahoma. From 
that basic shape, the paintings spin out into wild improvisation. Among the 
motifs detectable at a glance: a large 'M' referring to Fritz Lang's classic 
film, a crown of thorns lifted from Grunewald's Isenheim Altarpiece, a 
scientific rendering of the AIDs virus, a Dr. Seuss drawing of an elephant ear, 
genital imagery, drawings of weaponry copied from gun magazines, sketches of 
flying bricks and baseball bats, and motifs borrowed from Dante's Inferno, 
George Grosz, Odilon Redon, Paul Klee, James Ensor, David Cronenberg and Mayan 
tapestries. 
</P>
<P>
This highly complex art has evoked an equally complex response from the art 
world, which has been intensely critical of Rollins. Most of the negative 
criticism focuses on the marketing of K.O.S., rather than on the work itself. 
</P>
<P>
Says critic Michelle Wallace in a grumpy essay published in the catalogue for 
the DIA exhibition: "This work presents problems for me, the first and most 
obvious being their name, and the fact that of the group, only Rollins (because 
he's white, male and educated) has had an individual identity in the art world. 
And, isn't it true that if Rollins were black and a woman and the texts the 
group uses were black or Puerto Rican, that we'd be talking about something 
much less marketable, something infinitely more obscure?" 
</P>
<P>
Rollins responds: "Obviously there's some truth to the allegation that the 
media has focused on me because as a white, middle-class male they find me 
unthreatening. But, I am the one who got the project going and I am the one 
who's been working my booty off for the last decade. But the kids are not 
shoved into the background by any means. They'd all be here today because they 
usually participate in interviews, but they're on vacation this week -- and 
believe me, they were happy to palm off the interviewing duties on me. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't resent that Tim is the spokesman because we all get plenty of 
attention," Nelson Savinon said during a phone interview. "He's given me a lot 
and I'm always gonna stand by him whether I'm in K.O.S. or not because he's 
always been there for us." 
</P>
<P>
Even with K.O.S. members singing Rollins praises -- which they do -- critics 
have continued to question Rollins' intentions. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't believe the criticism I've encountered," says Rollins. "Lots of 
people have said 'what you're doing is ridiculous. You should never have 
brought these kids into this milieu because you're showing them things they can 
never really have.' I encounter that kind of cynicism constantly, but I know 
that a lot of these kids wouldn't have survived without K.O.S. -- and even with 
the support of the program, there've been many that we've lost. 
</P>
<P>
"Then there are the people who say K.O.S. is like Menudo -- that when the kids 
get to be a certain age I boot them out and replace them with new, cute young 
kids," he continues. "That's not true either. If you're committed to the work 
you're welcome to stay as long as you want. However, I won't let kids use 
K.O.S. as a nest. I've had kids . . . who become like lazy sons who won't get a 
job and lay in bed all day. Those kids do get the boot because it's not good 
for them to let them abuse this situation. 
</P>
<P>
"(K.O.S) is often mistakenly perceived as some kind of social work, and though 
there's an element of that, what we're doing is more complex. Some people say 
I'm a Socialist and a Marxist and I'm trying to make the kids look good -- that 
I do all the work and am the mastermind pulling the poor ghetto children up 
from their slothful existence. That isn't true at all. The biggest 
misconception, however, is that I'm exploiting the kids -- if anything, it's 
the other way around. The kids are paid good salaries for the work they do, and 
get lots of other benefits as well." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the strongest criticism has been the contention that with his use of 
classical literature, Rollins is immersing K.O.S. in a dying language system 
that's irrelevant to the lives of ghetto children living in the late 20th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes we use the idioms of European culture, but the 'Amerika' paintings are 
also full of references to world culture," counters Rollins. "African art, 
Santeria traditions -- it's all in there. The accusation that I'm 
indoctrinating the kids with European culture and destroying their native 
culture is absurd because their native culture was obliterated two generations 
ago with the advent of mass media. In America everybody has different roots, 
but unfortunately, the dominant culture in all our lives is pop culture -- TV 
and movies. 
</P>
<P>
"These books are classics for a reason. We've found them to be filled with 
issues that are a burning part of daily life in the South Bronx." 
</P>
<P>
As to the criticism that in a group that's ostensibly a democracy, Rollins 
alone decides what books will be used, he says "I select the books because the 
kids just aren't part of the world of literature. I'd love it if the kids 
brought books in, but that hasn't happened yet. We always debate the books I 
bring in, and several have been rejected by the group." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to having a voice in the selection of material, K.O.S. members are 
encouraged to do their own work after hours. 
</P>
<P>
"I sometimes do things on my own," says Savinon, who describes his solo work as 
abstract. "I haven't done a lot of stuff yet but because of K.O.S. I have a lot 
of connections, and I plan to take advantage of them and maybe try to get a 
gallery in Manhattan." 
</P>
<P>
While Savinon has his eye on a solo career in art, Nelson Montes, a group 
member since 1984, has something else in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"Before I met Tim I knew nothing about art. K.O.S. has taught me how to make 
art and how to appreciate it, but I don't want to be an artist -- I've always 
wanted to be a cop. I thought K.O.S. would change my mind about that, but it 
hasn't. I know it's dangerous but I like that, and I like being in the streets. 
I have no interest in leaving the South Bronx." 
</P>
<P>
Though K.O.S. salaries make it possible for the kids to move out of the Bronx 
-- and Nelson Savinon and George Garces now share an apartment in Manhattan -- 
most of them feel an allegiance to the neighborhood, despite the fact that it 
forces its children to grow up fast. The fact that there are more men than 
women in the group, for instance, is attributable to the fact that most young 
women in the South Bronx come from single-parent families, and spend their 
teen-age years cooking and caring for younger brothers and sisters. Male 
children are granted much more freedom -- not that time to spend on the street 
is an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"A life of crime is the norm for these kids," says Rollins. "They don't go to 
work at McDonald's when they become 16 -- they become drug dealers. There's a 
black market economy in the ghetto that's so easy for them to plug into because 
it preys on the bright kids. Another big problem they have to deal with is 
AIDS, which is extremely prevalent in the South Bronx. They have one of the 
highest heterosexual death rates in the country -- in fact, the other day I 
heard that 88% of the men in the South Bronx are HIV positive. We're thinking 
of all going together to get our blood test." 
</P>
<P>
Kids like Annette Rosado and Carlos Rivera, both now 18, have been with the 
group since they were 12. Rollins believes that the sense of accomplishment 
they've experienced through K.O.S. will help them tremendously, but feels 
there's a lot of work yet to be done. 
</P>
<P>
"It's extraordinary to me that the kids can experience the kind of success 
they've known through K.O.S. yet still suffer such a low level of 
self-confidence," he continues. "I've had kids that I've taken to Europe and 
they just wanted to lay in the hotel room and sleep. They didn't want to see 
anything because they're afraid of the new. 
</P>
<P>
"I've stayed in touch with a few of the kids who left the program, and lost 
touch with others. Most are too young to really start pushing a solo career in 
art, and much to my dismay, none have enrolled in college -- which the real 
goal behind all this. Unfortunately, a few have gotten into trouble. One was 
shot and killed last year for a gold chain he was wearing." 
</P>
<P>
K.O.S.' most recently completed body of work based on Flaubert's "The 
Temptation of St. Anthony," is a series of disturbing images that many have 
interpreted as a metaphor for the AIDs epidemic, but they plan to lighten the 
mood with their next series. 
</P>
<P>
'The kids have been wanting to do 'Pinocchio' and I'm excited by the idea of 
Jules Verne's 'From the Earth to the Moon,"' says Rollins. "The book's pretty 
dull, but it's a great title -- it suggests transcendence and possibility." 
</P>
<P>
Rollins is a man who knows a bit about transcendence and possibility -- he's 
traveled a long way from his humble beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
"I come from a little rural factory town in Maine with a population of 1,400," 
says Rollins. "I never had any training in working with emotionally handicapped 
kids, but I've always gravitated towards troubled kids, probably because I was 
an outsider kid myself. My family was really poor, my father was alcoholic and 
I grew up feeling a lot of anger. People like to romanticize the working class, 
and though it has some wonderful traditions, I experienced it as being riddled 
with sexism, violence, drinking and misery. I wanted out, and I knew from the 
time I was 6 that art would be the road out for me." 
</P>
<P>
Art studies with Joseph Kosuth were followed by a stint at New York University, 
where Rollins received his masters in art education. In 1981 (the year he 
hooked up with his companion of the past nine years, B-52s vocalist Kate 
Pierson), he landed the teaching job that led to the formation of K.O.S. 
</P>
<P>
"When I came into the school system I was struck by the fact that though there 
are a lot of programs for dyslexic young children, if you miss the boat and get 
to be 17 or 18 without dealing with the problem you're out of luck -- there are 
few programs for these kids. I've always thought that's the time to get a kid. 
Speaking for myself, that's when I met an art teacher who told me 'no Tim, you 
don't have to work in a factory all your life, yes you can be an artist.' All I 
needed was someone to push me." 
</P>
<P>
Having been given a push by Rollins, the kids in K.O.S. have progressed in 
leaps and bounds. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids operate extremely well in the New York art world," says Rollins 
beaming like a proud father. "They can go to an opening in Manhattan and talk 
to Robert Ryman with intelligence and confidence. However, the art world is 
extremely myopic and we've found it to be extremely prejudiced against art made 
by children. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons people tend to dismiss children's art is because it's 
usually made out of inferior materials like glitter and macaroni," he adds. 
"How many adult artists have managed to build successful careers around art 
made from construction paper, Elmer's Glue and cotton balls? Not too many, and 
that's why I went to great lengths to see that we had decent materials to work 
with. " 
</P>
<P>
Using traditional high art materials helped K.O.S.' credibility, however, they 
still found the art world reluctant to acknowledge them as legitimate 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first showed the 'Amerika' paintings," Rollins said, "people who saw 
them would approach our dealer and say wow! Who's this new young artist!? When 
they found out the work was by a schoolteacher and a bunch of kids from the 
Bronx their attitude changed completely. They'd become patronizing and 
condescending and would say 'oh, what a nice project.' All of a sudden it 
wasn't a painting, it was a project. This is a subtle form of racism, a way of 
keeping what they perceive as undesirables in their place." 
</P>
<P>
With several years of slugging it out on the gallery circuit under their belts, 
Rollins and K.O.S. are about to shift their energies to the biggest challenge 
they've faced thus far: the building of the school they've dreamed of since the 
group was formed. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't going to do any commercial exhibitions until 1992 -- we want to get 
off that trip," Rollins said. "We'll still be making work, but we'll mostly be 
concentrating on building the school. We're getting the corporation together so 
we can start accepting the money people want to give us and we're applying for 
accreditation. It will be a privately funded school, and though I can't say who 
the donors are at this delicate stage of negotiations, I can say that they're 
very big foundations. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of why I wanted to talk with you today was to get this story out so other 
people will start doing this -- programs like this could be implemented all 
across America," he concludes. "There've been lots of new forms and new content 
in fine art, but there've been very few new methods, and we've proven that this 
is a new method that works. How art is made, and for who, and who's allowed 
into this pantheon will be crucial questions in the coming decade, and we 
address those questions in this work. We need a revolutionary approach to art 
and learning, and K.O.S. is a step in that direction."

BOB BARKER WINS THE GAME OF ENDURANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
While most game-show hosts come and go, fading as quickly as their wrinkles 
appear, one man has managed to survive for three decades. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Barker, 66, spent 18 years as host of "Truth or Consequences" and is about 
to begin his 19th season as emcee of CBS' venerable "The Price Is Right." 
</P>
<P>
"It's amazing," Barker said. "What's even more amazing than the longevity is 
that it's the highest-rated game show." 
</P>
<P>
Barker was still hosting the syndicated nighttime version of "Truth or 
Consequences" when he began his duties on "Price Is Right." 
</P>
<P>
"It never entered my mind that I would do 'Price Is Right' longer than 'Truth 
or Consequences,' " Barker said, laughing. "It never entered my mind I would do 
anything longer. It never entered my mind I would even live longer." 
</P>
<P>
So why has "Price Is Right" been around for so long? 
</P>
<P>
"The reason it was so popular originally (it began in the '50s in a less glitzy 
version with Bill Cullen as host) and why it is still popular is because of the 
powerful basic premise of the show -- everything is based on prices," Barker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone identifies with prices. The minute we put something up for bid and 
the contestant makes a bid, the viewer is involved. Once you become involved, 
we have accomplished what the producer of every game show wants -- viewer 
involvement. 'The Price Is Right' has that to the nth degree." 
</P>
<P>
Though "Price Is Right" is taped, Barker does the show as if it were live. "The 
only editing we have ever done is for some technical problem. I think another 
reason for the success of the show is that it has a live feel." 
</P>
<P>
Contestants have come from around the world to be on "Price Is Right." And they 
are determined to be on the show, no matter what happens. 
</P>
<P>
"I was talking to the audience once during a break and a young woman in the 
audience began to have a baby," Barker said. "I turned to the pages and said, 
'Will you help her out?' This woman said, 'I don't want to go, you might call 
my name.' Now can you believe it? I said, 'Madam, we are not going to call any 
more names until you are on your way to the hospital.' " 
</P>
<P>
Though most of the veteran game-show hosts complain that producers are looking 
for younger faces to host shows, Barker said the "Price Is Right" ratings 
improved when he let his hair go gray. 
</P>
<P>
"I was prematurely gray," he said. "I began to gray at my temples, and I guess 
it could be that technology at that time was not what it is today, but I didn't 
look good. It looked like I had no hair at my temples, so they suggested I tint 
it." 
</P>
<P>
For years, Barker used tint until the tint made his hair blue. Then someone 
suggested he dye his hair, which eventually turned red. 
</P>
<P>
"I went on vacation and I just let it go," he said. "When I came home the 
people on the show said, 'You look better this way than you do with it dyed or 
tinted. Why don't you leave it this way?' " 
</P>
<P>
Barker started to chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
"We taped ahead," he said. "So let's say on the Wednesday show I had dark hair, 
but when we taped the next show I had gray hair and that show aired on 
Thursday. I got a letter from a fellow who said, 'Bob, you must have had one 
hell of a night.' " SUSAN KING
