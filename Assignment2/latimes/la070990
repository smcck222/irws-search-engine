PROTESTERS VANDALIZE 2 CATHOLIC FACILITIES 
</P>

In a graphic protest against the Roman Catholic clergy's position on abortion 
and AIDS, vandals struck the headquarters of the Los Angeles Archdiocese and a 
Torrance church Sunday, leaving behind graffiti, red coat hangers, a wooden 
cross festooned with condoms and a mattress apparently stuffed with animal 
entrails. 
</P>
<P>
Police had no suspects, but in a telephone call to United Press International, 
a group calling itself Artists Against Religious Oppression claimed 
responsibility for what it called the "artwork" that was left just before dawn 
at St. Catherine Laboure Roman Catholic Church in Torrance and at an 
archdiocese office building just west of downtown where Archbishop Roger M. 
Mahony works. 
</P>
<P>
"The message is that the church should stay out of politics and medicine; that 
it should stop its oppression of women, gays and lesbians; that it should stop 
preaching sin and lies and that it should start preaching safe sex and the 
truth," an unidentified spokeswoman for the group told UPI. 
</P>
<P>
Archdiocese spokesman Rev. Gregory Coiro called the protest the work of 
"extremists" who undermine "the serious public policy debate" over the church's 
stance against abortion and the use of condoms as a means to prevent the spread 
of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
"This type of activity really is an assault against the First Amendment," Coiro 
said. "It's an assault on freedom of speech. It's an assault on freedom of 
religion." 
</P>
<P>
In front of the archdiocese building at 1531 W. 9th Street, the vandals propped 
up a brown mattress stuffed with red coat hangers, in apparent reference to the 
era of back-room abortions; animal entrails, and what appeared to be an 
animal's skin, according to witnesses. "Mahony murders women" was painted on 
the mattress in white. 
</P>
<P>
At St. Catherine Laboure Church on Redondo Beach Boulevard, police said a 
10-foot-tall wooden cross was bolted to the door. The cross was covered with 
about 30 fake penises -- police described them as "marital aids" -- covered 
with condoms. Red coat hangers were strewn about the sidewalk, where the 
vandals spray-painted the words "Safe sex saves. Mahony kills." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's attack was not the first time that local Roman Catholic clergy and 
churches have been targeted by vandals. 
</P>
<P>
In December, four Los Angeles churches were spattered with red paint by 
demonstrators who denounced Mahony as a "murderer" for his view that chastity, 
rather than the use of condoms, is the only morally correct way to stop AIDS. 
Unnamed gay activists claimed responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
A church in Silver Lake has been vandalized five times this year. 
</P>
<P>
Parishioners at St. Catherine Laboure said Sunday's attack was not the first at 
their church. During the last several months, they said, a concrete statue of 
their patron saint has been destroyed, the exterior of the church has been 
bombarded with Christmas ornaments filled with red paint and the rectory has 
received threatening telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
The pastor of the church declined to comment on Sunday's incident and 
parishioners said it was not discussed during Mass. Church officials, who had 
been notified by police at about 5:30 a.m. that the attack had occurred, 
removed the cross and covered up the sidewalk graffiti with door mats long 
before services began. So it was not until reporters arrived that parishioners 
learned that their church had been hit again. 
</P>
<P>
Parishioners said they believe their church has been singled out because some 
of its members are active in Operation Rescue, a vocal anti-abortion group, and 
because they provide support to a nearby maternity clinic that counsels women 
on alternatives to abortion. They said they were hurt, angered and saddened by 
the vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
"It's terrible," said Alice Aguirre. "It's a church and they have no respect 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Clay Watson, who has attended St. Catherine Laboure since 1947, "This is 
our life. When they hit the church, they hit us."

A MARRIAGE OF PERFECTION; 
</P>
<P>
500,000 VISITORS DRAWN YEARLY TO SEASIDE WAYFARERS CHAPEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It's a perfect marriage of function and form, the way the small glass building 
perched on the ocean cliff manages to be both serene and spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
And it was the perfect place to get married, Diane Jones of Annapolis, Md., and 
Harold Grossnickle of Clearwater, Fla., agreed when they arrived at the 
Wayfarers Chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to be married in a place that was both intimate and inspiring," 
explained the bride. "We wanted a place that our children, if we have any, can 
come back to," added the groom. 
</P>
<P>
Dappled sunlight cascaded gently into the chapel through its glass roof one 
afternoon last week as the couple's wedding guests filed in for their ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
A sea breeze rustled the lush woodsia ferns and philodendron planted along the 
sanctuary's interior walls and flickered the candles that lined the ivy-topped 
stone altar. The strains of a Mozart minuet played by a string quartet echoed 
softly from the back of the room. 
</P>
<P>
Opened in 1951 as a place for travelers to rest and meditate, the Wayfarers 
Chapel has become a Los Angeles landmark that now attracts 500,000 visitors a 
year. Along the way, it has also earned a reputation as the busiest matrimonial 
center this side of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
More than 750 couples -- including 100 from Japan -- last year marched down the 
aisle built from polished, chalk-white Palos Verdes stone. 
</P>
<P>
The weddings are a nice blending of form and function for Wayfarers Chapel, 
too, according to its operators. 
</P>
<P>
Each newlywed couple is asked to make an $825 contribution ($975 for weekend 
ceremonies) that is used to pay for chapel maintenance. The fee also helps 
finance continuing repair work to the 3 1/2-acre grounds that were damaged from 
a 1979 landslide at nearby Abalone Cove. 
</P>
<P>
The 100-seat chapel is operated by the Swedenborgian Church, a small, 
203-year-old Christian denomination whose followers have included Helen Keller, 
Ralph Waldo Emerson and John (Johnny Appleseed) Chapman. 
</P>
<P>
The sanctuary was designed by Lloyd Wright, son of famed architect Frank Lloyd 
Wright. His choice of rough local stone and redwood beams to hold up a fragile 
skin of glass was seen as daring when the $80,000 project was started in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
Wright personally selected the coastal redwoods, Cypress lelandi and Monterey 
pines that were planted outside the chapel. The trees were placed on bermed 
earth supported by stone retaining walls that form part of the sanctuary's 
interior. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the trees and their trunks to be seen," explained Wright, who died in 
1978 at age 88. "The trees, the natural growth, the sky and the sea become part 
of the chapel. The glass provides protection, but at the same time gives the 
congregation a sense of outer as well as inner space." 
</P>
<P>
Rev. Harvey A. Tafel, who has directed the chapel since 1972, said the unusual 
open chapel design "sets off some responding chord" that evokes peace in 
visitors. "People call it the 'glass church,' but it's really a tree chapel," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Marcy Sudock, a Long Beach violinist who has played at hundreds of 
Wayfarers weddings: "This is one of the few places where people aren't tense at 
weddings. You're in touch with nature here. You have trees and sky to look at, 
not just walls and statuary." 
</P>
<P>
Wedding photographer Ron Wiener of Torrance has chronicled more than 1,000 
marriage ceremonies at the chapel. "Each day is a little different. The weather 
and the light change. It's a photographer's paradise -- it's hard to take a bad 
picture," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
After the Rev. Carl Yenetchi pronounced the Grossnickles man and wife, Wiener 
posed them on the bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean and Santa Catalina 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
The bride said she selected Wayfarers Chapel after her father, Anaheim resident 
Bob Jones, made a videotape of the grounds and mailed it to her. 
</P>
<P>
"This is gorgeous," agreed the groom's twin sister, Carol Miller of Ankeny, 
Iowa. "It sure is different from home." 
</P>
<P>
A few steps away, Wayfarers worker Charlie Kissel stood guard next to a sign 
warning visitors that the sanctuary was temporarily shut because of the nuptial 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
One of those he turned away was tourist Emma King of Midland, Tex. "I've wanted 
to see this for years," a disappointed King explained. "My husband has said if 
I never see anything else in Los Angeles, I should see this. I'm going to 
wait." 
</P>
<P>
Chapel wedding coordinator Kim Ericksen said visitors are urged to linger 
elsewhere on the shaded grounds during the 1 1/2 hours that the chapel is 
closed for each wedding. 
</P>
<P>
"People always say they've driven 1,000 miles to see this and they're on their 
way to the airport to leave," Ericksen said. "But you don't want tourists 
gawking in shorts and T-shirts when you're getting married." 
</P>
<P>
As the Grossnickle wedding party drifted away, Kissel ushered the visitors in. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Freele of Perth, Australia, was accompanied by cousins Mona and Larry 
Wilk of La Puente and their daughter, Colleen Keith of Hacienda Heights. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our other cousins was married here," Keith explained. "We have a big 
family -- about 40 cousins -- and we've had lots of weddings. The one here is 
the one that still stands out." 
</P>
<P>
Said Freele: "This has made a Southern California fan out of me."

NAACP'S HEAD GIVES RIGHTS BILL WARNING; 
</P>
<P>
CONVENTION: BENJAMIN HOOKS SAYS DEFEAT OF KENNEDY MEASURE MAY LEAD TO ECONOMIC 
AND SOCIAL 'SLAVERY' FOR BLACKS. HE ALSO DECRIES 'SELECTIVE PROSECUTION' OF 
BLACK OFFICIALS. 
</P>

<P>
With the fate of a major civil rights bill still uncertain, the leader of the 
NAACP opened the organization's 81st national convention Sunday evening in Los 
Angeles with a warning that defeat of the legislation may lead to economic and 
social "slavery" for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address before about 5,000 people at the Los Angeles Convention 
Center, Dr. Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the NAACP, also had 
indirect words of support for embattled Washington Mayor Marion Barry, now on 
trial for drug and perjury charges. 
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning Barry by name, Hooks spoke of "the vicious assault on black 
leaders. At no time since Reconstruction has there been a comparable period of 
incessant harassment of black elected officials." 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People is focusing this year 
on passage of the civil rights act of 1990. The bill by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.) seeks to reverse five U.S. Supreme Court decisions during the last 
two years that dealt serious blows to affirmative action and 
anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
"I warn you tonight that unless we are successful in reversing the Supreme 
Court's turn-back-the-clock actions, we may again find ourselves -- literally 
and figuratively -- on the back of the bus," Hooks told delegates. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate is to begin debating the bill Tuesday. In April, Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh said he would oppose the bill and NAACP leaders fear a presidential 
veto. 
</P>
<P>
Those who attended Sunday's opening session were welcomed by Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in his keynote speech, Hooks drew strong applause as he attacked the 
Justice Department and other government agencies for their investigations of 
black politicians, including Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
"I am so tired of the selective prosecution of black elected officials," Hooks 
said. "I'm tired of the hypocrisy. I may be paranoid. But even paranoid people 
have enemies." 
</P>
<P>
The five-day convention is also expected to highlight the NAACP's increasing 
emphasis on economic and social issues. One convention workshop, titled "The 
Endangered Black Male," will focus on the disproportionate number of young 
black men in prison or suffering from drug and alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"If we allow a third of black America to wallow in poverty, allow black young 
men to continue to be gunned down at alarming rates, watch our people become 
intoxicated by the lures of the drug trade, history will embarrass us," Hooks 
told delegates. 
</P>
<P>
A host of black political leaders and entertainers are scheduled to address the 
convention. They include actress and television talk show host Oprah Winfrey; 
the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference, and Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, the nation's first elected 
black governor, who will address the convention Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 1,000 high school students from throughout the country 
will participate in the NAACP's Afro-Academic, Technological and Scientific 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates will also consider a resolution that could reverse the organization's 
stand on immigration reform. Up to now, the black civil rights group has 
supported penalties against employers who hire illegal immigrant workers, 
arguing that the low-paid immigrants take jobs from blacks. 
</P>
<P>
In May, two Latino groups threatened to pull out of the influential Leadership 
Conference on Civil Rights -- a coalition of 183 groups including the NAACP -- 
because the black civil rights group did not support a Latino effort to repeal 
employer sanctions.

<P>
ENVIRONMENT: POLLUTION MARS AMERICA'S NATIONAL PARKS MORE THAN 90% OF THE TIME.

<P>
Millions of families this summer will flee smog-bound cities for the majestic 
surroundings of America's national parks, only to find that air pollution has 
beat them there and clouded the post card vistas. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, air pollution in the parks is neither isolated nor new. 
According to National Park Service statistics, man-made pollution affects the 
scenic park views more than 90% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't know how important a clear view is until you travel a long way to 
see the parks and then find bad air," said Mark Scruggs, chief of research for 
the National Park Service Air Quality Division in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
According to Scruggs, pollution problems in certain parts of the country have 
improved in recent years, but the atmosphere at other parks has become much 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the extreme variability in weather conditions, the Park Service has 
not been able to identify a national trend concerning the air quality in parks. 
But there are notable changes in specific regions. The air quality at western 
parks (based on selected sites) has improved in recent years, according to data 
from the Park Service and other sources, while it has continued to deteriorate 
in eastern parks. 
</P>
<P>
In general, the parks with the best visibility are in eastern Nevada, western 
Utah and southern Idaho. The next-best air is in the Colorado plateau region, 
which includes the Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon and Zion National parks, followed 
by northern Arizona, most of New Mexico and the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
The worst visibility is found in the Shenandoah (Virginia) and Great Smoky 
Mountains (Tennessee/North Carolina) parks. 
</P>
<P>
In the West, the poorest visibility is along the coasts of California and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Although a portion of the visibility problem -- which is seen in various forms 
of haze conditions -- can be attributed to causes such as traffic dust, it is 
primarily caused by sulfate particles produced by utilities and heavy industry. 
</P>
<P>
These particles, emitted by smelters, power plants, refineries and oil and gas 
fields, can travel long distances in the atmosphere. In the Colorado Plateau 
region, sulfate particles cause 40% to 60% of the pollution, and in Eastern 
parks these particles are an even greater contributor to haze and smog. 
</P>
<P>
But pollutants from faraway urban areas can also be significant causes of park 
air pollution. For example, Southern California industry makes a substantial 
contribution to the pollution of the Rocky Mountain and Grand Canyon national 
parks, while much of the Shenandoah park pollution can be traced to the 
industrial centers of Detroit and Gary, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of these and other sources varies from summer to winter. In the 
summer, unstable weather conditions help carry sulfate pollutants from urban 
industrial areas to remote parks such as Rocky Mountain and Grand Canyon, 
creating seasonally worse haze conditions. During winter months, locally 
produced pollution can be trapped for several days by stagnant air masses. 
</P>
<P>
The Park Service has observed some improvements in some western regions. For 
example, according to a Park Service report, the visibility of the Colorado 
Plateau Region has improved since pollution peaked there in 1985. The reason 
for the improved visibility in these parks appears to be a reduction in the 
sulfur oxide emissions from nearby copper smelters. Since 1982, four smelters 
have been closed and another three have installed advanced pollution-control 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the East, park pollution has become steadily worse over the last 
40 years. According to the Park Service, sulfate levels in parks such as the 
Great Smoky and Shenandoah are 10 times greater than western parks. The 
problem, Scruggs said, is that the number of sulfate-spewing polluters has 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
Other studies underscore the Park Service conclusion. For instance, the 
National Weather Service has shown that the average summertime visibility over 
much of the eastern United States has decreased more than 50% since 1948 to a 
current visual range of less than 15.5 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Scruggs said that a few more years of data will be needed to conclude that 
visibility is declining or remaining the same on a national basis throughout 
the park system. But he leaves little doubt that air pollution is a major 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"Everywhere we monitor we have found visibility impairment due to man-made 
conditions," Scruggs said. "When the visibility is bad you can't see the 
colors, textures or shadows, (and) to me that's a serious issue." 
</P>
<P>
Park Service scientists also worry about the long-term effects of air pollution 
on the park system's flora and fauna. Research has indicated that certain air 
pollutants can cause reduced growth and higher mortality in sensitive plant 
species. Animals are also affected as their food sources become contaminated or 
depleted. Scientists are also concerned that the buildup of acid deposits from 
sulfur oxide emissions may be harmful to plant and animal life, but a direct 
link between the two has not yet been made. 
</P>
<P>
Air pollution also has a dramatic effect on park visitors. The Park Service has 
conducted surveys that show that most visitors would travel farther and pay 
higher entrance fees to ensure better visibility during their park stay. 
</P>
<P>
The surveys also pointed out that even a small increase in air pollution is 
more apparent and disturbing to park visitors who are counting on enjoying 
spectacular views. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, visitors from more urban areas may come (to a polluted park) and 
think it's a great view," Scruggs added. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its responsibility to protect air quality, the Park Service has 
expanded an air-quality research and monitoring network established in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
The 1977 Clean Air Act Amendments provided the impetus, setting a goal of 
improving existing air quality and eliminating future visibility problems in 
the nation's parks. 
</P>
<P>
Monitoring consists of a variety of techniques, including the use of 35mm 
cameras which record changes in visibility during different weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Other devices measure airborne particulates and air clarity. Currently, 55 U.S. 
parks are being monitored, mostly in the West, where open panoramas and 
generally cleaner air allow for long-distance viewing. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Park Service has no authority to control pollution sources outside 
the parks, it does influence the Environmental Protection Agency and other 
government bodies. Armed with the data collected from its monitoring program, 
the Park Service evaluates conditions, compiles reports and makes 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
One of its most important activities is to review permit applications for 
industrial and energy-generating facilities near the parks. Since 1978, the 
Park Service has reviewed nearly 300 applications to ensure that existing and 
planned sites do not harm air quality. 
</P>
<P>
Although no permit applications have been denied, some have come quite close, 
including a pulp mill in Maine. Moreover, the Park Service has recommended 
modified emission-control technology in several instances. A notable example of 
the review process focuses on the Navajo Generating Station near the Grand 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Based on previous monitoring, the Park Service has determined what portion of 
the Grand Canyon pollution it believes can be attributed to this facility. The 
EPA is now assessing that information and early next year will reach a decision 
on how best to control the emissions. 
</P>
<P>
Still, no matter how much monitoring, evaluating and reporting, it is clear 
that the national parks' once-pristine views may never be the same. As Scruggs 
emphasized, visitors will never have the opportunity to enjoy the views that 
turn-of-the-century travelers once took for granted. 
</P>
<P>
"It's frustrating to . . . know the visibility could be better," he said. 
"People think they can go to the parks and escape from the problems faced in 
urban areas, but it's no longer possible."

Weather changes caused by unusual Pacific ocean currents may have led 
scientists to overestimate how much the Earth has warmed in recent decades, 
according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Angell of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has 
calculated the amount of global warming associated with the El Nino events over 
the last couple of decades. 
</P>
<P>
Subtracting the ocean effects reduces the global warming by one-fourth between 
the 1960s and the 1980s, according to Angell's report, published last week. 
</P>
<P>
It may be that part of the increase in global warming is a result of the 
strength of the El Nino events in the 1980s, but it may also be that the global 
warming led to more and stronger El Ninos, Angell said. El Nino events involve 
unusually warm water moving eastward in the Pacific Ocean that can affect 
weather events worldwide during their lifetime of a year or so. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists have estimated that the layer of air closest to the Earth warmed by 
0.33 degrees Celsius (0.59 degrees Fahrenheit) between the 1960s and the 1980s. 
Angell found that after subtracting the effect of the El Nino warming from the 
record, the air had warmed by 0.24 degrees Celsius (0.43 degrees Fahrenheit).

The forelimbs of the ancient carnivorous dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex appear to 
have been more powerful than previously thought, paleontologists reported last 
week at an evolutionary biology conference at the University of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
The new theory suggests that the small forelimbs of the dinosaur, once thought 
to be little more than weak vestigial extremities, could grasp prey weighing 
400 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, each of the forelimbs ended in two opposing claws that could tightly 
hold struggling prey, allowing the dinosaur to sink its razor-sharp teeth into 
the prey. 
</P>
<P>
Matthew B. Smith of Montana State University and colleagues analyzed the most 
complete Tyrannosaurus skeleton ever excavated, discovered 18 months ago in 
eastern Montana. The bones include the first example of the dinosaur's forelimb 
and claw. They studied muscle patterns left in the forelimb bones and 
correlated the thickness of the scars to the size that the muscles must have 
been present. Calculations revealed that the Tyrannosaurus could have lifted 
400 pounds and each forelimb was as thick as a human thigh.

STUDY LINKS DEPRESSION TO FATIGUE SYNDROME

Depression may be the primary cause of debilitating chronic fatigue syndrome, 
the so-called "yuppie flu," and not a common virus, scientists reported last 
week in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
University of Washington researchers said comparisons of 26 people who suffered 
from chronic fatigue and 18 others with no medical complaints turned up no 
evidence the syndrome is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), as some past 
studies had suggested. 
</P>
<P>
EBV, which causes mononucleosis, had been suspected of causing chronic fatigue 
because many victims of the disease showed signs of being infected with it. 
</P>
<P>
The primary symptom is long-term lethargy that leaves victims unable to 
function normally and often, unable to work. 
</P>
<P>
The new study revealed that those with chronic fatigue had "a strikingly higher 
rate of lifetime and current major depression than controls." Thirteen of the 
chronic fatigue sufferers had experienced at least one episode of major 
depression before the onset of their illnesses.

<TEXT>
<P>
Although there have been no parades or peace treaties, it is clear that the 
Cold War is over -- and that we have won. 
</P>
<P>
Now, will the reward be an expanding economy, new foreign markets and global 
stability? Or will the end of 40 years of confrontation bring layoffs, 
recessions and uncertainty? The answer depends largely on what happens in 
Houston this week, when the leaders of the Group of Seven industrial 
democracies meet to set the rules of engagement for the new economic order. 
</P>
<P>
At the economic summit, the victors will address how to help the vanquished 
join the community of free nations. In the absence of American leadership, West 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterand will step 
forward to propose an emergency aid package to speed the Soviet Union's 
transition from a Marxist command economy to a free market, and from 
authoritarian rule to democratic pluralism. Kohl has also announced $3 billion 
in bilateral loans. Canada provided $500 million in credits during President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit in late May. Even British Prime Minister Margaret 
Thatcher's government, which is openly skeptical over changes in the Soviet 
Union, now concedes that it is not a question of whether we assist the Soviets, 
but when and how. 
</P>
<P>
While President Bush talks about change, our economic competitors are investing 
their money. Unless we move soon, we could be left in the rear guard or on the 
sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
What should be the American response? We should start by recognizing our 
interest in seeing economic reform succeed in the Soviet Union. Only when that 
nation has moved toward a market economy and democratic values will it step 
forward as a full partner in the new global economy. Nothing is more exciting 
than the prospect of a prosperous Soviet market of 289 million consumers eager 
to buy Western goods. By contrast, nothing is more dangerous than a shaky, 
bankrupt superpower hiding behind thousands of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
A package of economic and technical assistance to support economic freedom and 
democracy in the Soviet Union is the surest path toward the long-term peace we 
have sought through four decades of Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
Such a package would not include blank checks. Without fundamental reform in 
the Soviet Union, foreign aid only reinforces existing inefficiencies. Instead 
-- and working with the other industrial powers -- we should provide assistance 
that encourages, reinforces and validates real Soviet change. All Western aid 
must have strings attached, strings that draw the Soviets forward to 
responsible international behavior, free markets, reduced military spending and 
respect for human rights. 
</P>
<P>
While Gorbachev may back away from a head-first plunge into a market economy, 
viewing a radical reform program as too dangerous or destabilizing to adopt 
overnight, it is nonetheless essential that the Soviets take at least some 
measured steps in the free-market direction. Moscow should proceed with 
monetary reform to rebuild faith in the currency, set up commercial banking 
institutions to channel savings into new private enterprises, break up large 
government monopolies and back away from central planning. It should also allow 
free-market forces to set virtually all prices, controlling only 
ultra-sensitive products like fuel, rent and food. 
</P>
<P>
Such reforms would create the momentum toward economic freedom. The West should 
match these actions, step for step, with: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Loans, food assistance and export credits to relieve short-term 
dislocations in the Soviet economy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Full membership in Western economic and financial organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Technical assistance, financial support and political-risk insurance for 
U.S. investors in joint ventures -- especially in regions where liberal 
reformers are in power -- to foster a Soviet private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Preferential tariff rates and relaxed restrictions on non-military 
high-tech exports as soon as the Soviets enact liberal emigration policies and 
abandon coercive pressure on the Baltic states. 
</P>
<P>
The unavoidable truth of our time is that communism is dead. The unanswered 
question is whether it will be replaced by democracy and free enterprise -- 
opening up new markets for our goods and creating new jobs for our workers -- 
or something alien and chaotic, perhaps even a misshapen replay of communism's 
past failures. 
</P>
<P>
The Europeans have opened the door. If we do not enter, we could be locked out 
of new opportunities generated by exports to a reviving Soviet economy. Our 
leadership in this, the first grand cooperative enterprise of the post-Cold War 
era, will set the tone for continued U.S. leadership in the decades ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The stakes could not be higher. The threat could not be more real. Fifty years 
from now, the 1990s will be remembered as the time when America reinvented 
itself once again, and in so doing led the world into a new era of peace and 
prosperity. That is, if we have the vision to see the change in the course of 
history and the courage to adjust our course to meet it.

VATICAN BARS DISSENT ON OFFICIAL CHURCH TEACHINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your article fails to point out an important issue. So-called "Catholic" 
politicians who claim to be "personally against abortion, but have no right to 
impose my beliefs on others" can be compared to the following. 
</P>
<P>
If a black politician were to say, "I'm personally opposed to the Ku Klux 
Klan's anti-racial activities, but won't legislate for an end to racial abuse," 
or a Jewish politician to say, "I'm personally opposed to anti-Semitic 
activity, but won't impose my beliefs on the public," both groups would be 
rightly outraged by such betrayal. The case is the same for Catholic 
politicians. 
</P>
<P>
The Catholic faith is not an appendage to one's life that can be turned on or 
off, but the core identity of who one is. We as Catholics are reborn to eternal 
life through Jesus Christ and are to pattern our lives after his. This identity 
must affect all our decisions in whatever walk of life one is pursuing, or our 
faith is worthless. "None of those who cry out 'Lord, Lord' will enter the 
kingdom of God, but only the one who does the will of my heavenly Father" 
(Matthew 7:21).

HEY, BROTHER, CAN YOU SPARE A RUBLE?; 
</P>
<P>
BUT BUSH IS RIGHTLY CAUTIOUS ABOUT SOVIET AID NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
France, Italy and West Germany are all eager to begin channeling aid into the 
Soviet Union to help prop up President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's besieged and 
teetering economic reform program -- and, more particularly, Gorbachev himself. 
</P>
<P>
The United States urges caution, noting the admitted stumbling pace of efforts 
to replace the failed Soviet centralized planning system with essential 
free-market institutions. 
</P>
<P>
Consensus or not -- and right now not -- the issue promises to consume a lot of 
discussion time at the seven-nation economic summit that opens in Houston 
today. 
</P>
<P>
There is a good, hard-nosed, self-interested argument for the West to offer 
Moscow such things as managerial training and technical help to try to buttress 
an economy whose inability to provide basic goods and services is fanning ever 
greater discontent. The gist of that argument is that the West gains if a 
reform-minded Gorbachev, or a reasonable facsimile thereof, can hold on to 
power in the face of conservative resistance, and use that power to steer 
Soviet resources and energies toward more productive and humane ends. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev and his advisers know what has to be done. Spending on the military 
and on heavy industry -- the two are often closely related -- must be severely 
cut, with investment directed toward achieving greater efficiencies and 
producing quality consumer goods. Decision-making must be decentralized, with 
demand rather than command dictating economic choices. 
</P>
<P>
Achieving these things would produce not only a less threatening Soviet Union, 
but one that is far more ready to be integrated into the world economy and far 
more likely to expand human freedoms even as it enlarges economic 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
The desirability of these objectives isn't in dispute. There are, though, hard 
practical and political questions that have to be honestly faced. The main 
practical question is whether Moscow is yet ready to put Western help to good 
use; the answer for now, as even some of Gorbachev's economic advisers agree, 
is that it's not. The key political question is whether Western leaders, or at 
any rate a U.S. President, can responsibly propose putting scarce dollars into 
a country that still spends about $15 billion a year subsidizing such clients 
as Cuba and Syria, and that devotes one-fourth of its gross national product -- 
about four times what the United States spends -- to its military budget. The 
answer to that is apparent. 
</P>
<P>
Some European leaders talk about spending billions to help Gorbachev out. Far 
better for now to think small, or at least smaller. Aid ought to be linked to 
the reallocation of Soviet resources, and to progress in developing a true 
market economy. That still leaves a lot of room for early help, including 
targeted technical advice, small-scale agricultural, industrial and 
environmental demonstration projects, food and other humanitarian aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
The Europeans, of course, are free to do what they want individually; as 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III has made clear, Washington won't object. 
The Europeans might pick up some political influence by jumping in with aid 
early, although by moving too fast they could also, of course, be inviting 
major disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
But Washington has scant room for maneuvering, especially given our deficit, 
except to look at any Soviet aid program critically and cautiously. President 
Bush shouldn't be embarrassed about expressing his well-founded doubts in 
Houston. It's possible that our allies might even thank him someday for 
steering them away from costly mistakes.

<P>
However, I must warn the mayor to keep a close eye on DWP officials, as they 
are very adept at skirting agreements, moratoriums, laws, etc., After all, 
they've had nearly 100 years of practice here in the Owens Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Mayor Bradley, if you think about it, its initials give us clues to its 
true character. In your case, "DWP" stands for "Damn Well Please!" as the 
agency has done just that for years. However, in the Owens Valley the initials 
stand for "Damn Water Pirates."

THE DEFENSE ESTABLISHMENT HAS ITS EYE ON ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION AS A WAY TO

<TEXT>
<P>
When Sen. Sam Nunn proposed last month that military forces be used for 
environmental protection, I got a queasy feeling in my stomach. Not that I 
disagree with him; many disarmament activists, like myself, for years have 
argued that environmental destruction was a fundamental threat to the nation's 
well-being. 
</P>
<P>
But the imprimatur of Sam Nunn made me first blink in disbelief, then look 
twice at the small print. 
</P>
<P>
Nunn and his Democratic colleagues Albert Gore, Tim Wirth, Jeff Bingaman and 
James Exon are proposing a "Strategic Environmental Research Program" that 
would use the skills and resources of the military, the CIA and the Energy 
Department to blunt the assault of this new national security threat, 
environmental degradation. Nunn, the hard-nosed chairman of the Armed Services 
Committee, saying that ecology was the stuff of generals and admirals, jet 
pilots and spooks? How did this happen? 
</P>
<P>
The proposal has roots in the work of peace researchers, who insisted that 
America's obsession with military security ignored other perils, such as global 
warming, deforestation, ozone depletion, loss of croplands and overpopulation. 
(Similarly, drug addiction and economic deterioration should be treated as 
security threats.) The federal government spent little money on such problems 
while lavishing resources on increasingly antiquated military strategies. 
</P>
<P>
A small cottage industry of researchers sprouted in the mid-1980s to develop 
this analysis. Magazines like the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and Nuclear 
Times published the first articles attempting to redefine security. Long 
accused of reflexively opposing all weapons (and the U.S. doctrine of national 
defense), peaceniks could instead offer a positive notion: global security. 
</P>
<P>
This concept holds that environmental decay is international, unmindful of 
boundaries and sovereignties, and that it can cause serious social strains that 
lead to conflict. For example, overpopulation and over-grazing can lead to 
drought, which sends masses of starving people across borders in search of 
food. The reluctant host country might be no better off, and the pressure 
erupts in war, involving allies and enemies far away. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of global environmental security became widely accepted, particularly 
in the U.S. policy Establishment, after the hot summer of 1988. Articles 
touting the link between the environment and security began to appear in 
influential journals like Foreign Affairs. Polls showed that the American 
public, with little prompting, saw global warming, cocaine and trade imbalance 
as far greater threats than the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
So when I saw Sam Nunn's suggestion, I felt a certain satisfaction. But the 
purpose of this "natural security" initiative has a side never intended by the 
concept's originators. Nunn &amp; Co. are apparently using the high public 
concern about the environment to keep the bloated and increasingly irrelevant 
Pentagon afloat. 
</P>
<P>
This is doubly ironic. The U.S. military is the nation's -- perhaps the world's 
-- largest polluter. Its use of fossil fuels and other natural resources is 
awesome; it has created 15,000 toxic waste sites; the radioactive hazards at 
its 17 nuclear-weapons plants are a national scandal. The first aim of Nunn's 
"Strategic Environmental Research Program" should be to clean up the ecological 
disasters spawned by the armed forces, a cleanup that rivals the 
savings-and-loan crisis in financial scale. 
</P>
<P>
Equally important, the Nunn initiative fails to understand that military 
approaches are inappropriate to the new threats we face. The global security 
concept includes reducing the role of the military in the political life of 
nations. The sources of armed conflict in the Third World -- poverty, for 
example, and depletion of resources like forests and croplands -- are 
impervious to armies and nuclear doctrines. In short, applying military ideas 
and assets to environmental issues will solve nothing. Environmental 
restoration requires sensitive economic development, tough regulation of 
industry, birth control, and sweeping changes in attitudes -- tasks for which 
the military is ill-equipped. 
</P>
<P>
We do need to accept and act on the realization that environmental degradation 
threatens our long-term health as a society. But acting on a new agenda for 
global security and keeping the military-industrial complex intact are 
incompatible. A better mission for the Pentagon brass is to scale down 
dramatically -- matching the scaled-down Soviet threat -- and let the savings 
be used to attack the horrific mess they've created.

By Retired Judge BRUCE SUMNER, former presiding judge of Orange County Superior 
Court, is chairman of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and 
Medicare. He told The Times: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The first thing that we found is that our members and seniors generally are 
very concerned with the fact that Social Security is considered in 
budget-deficit calculations. There is a very large reserve in the Social 
Security Trust Fund, and this reserve is loaned to the government to finance 
the programs that have been carried on in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
And that money, of course, will have to be repaid. The problem is further 
compounded by the fact that in determining what the deficit is in the budget, 
the amount of that reserve is deducted from the actual deficit. This gives a 
very unrealistic result. 
</P>
<P>
Social Security should be as it was originally, namely an independent agency -- 
independent of the Congress and independent of the President. Since Social 
Security is unique, it's a social insurance program that's paid for by the 
people that are members. And as I have indicated, the program is in surplus; it 
has a large reserve and so it doesn't require any money from the general 
taxpayer.

A SOVIET-GERMAN MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE LEAVES LITTLE ROOM FOR U.S. ROLE IN 
EUROPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANE KIRKPATRICK, Jeane Kirkpatrick writes a syndicated column in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the time he was appointed general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev has had three principal goals vis-a-vis the West: to 
prevent the resurgence of a German threat in the heart of Europe, to break the 
Soviet Union out of its technological and economic isolation and to eliminate a 
major U.S. presence in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
If Gorbachev stays in power, he has a good chance of achieving all three in 
this current season of change and reconfiguration in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
For such success -- if he achieves it -- he will be beholden not only to his 
own undoubted ability but, above all, to the extraordinary diplomatic skill and 
activity of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his foreign minister, 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher. For their trouble, they will also have achieved a 
united, sovereign Germany and left the Soviets, the French and the Americans 
each feeling that the country whose interest most closely coincides with their 
own is Germany. 
</P>
<P>
It promises to be a stunning achievement for both Gorbachev and Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet officials have made no secret of their fear of resurgent German power. 
What a surprise, then, to hear Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze say, 
as he did a few months ago, that the security of Europe is better served by the 
reunification of Germany than by its division, providing that it takes place in 
the context of an appropriate pan-European settlement. 
</P>
<P>
The European settlement that Gorbachev has had in mind is one that would 
"overcome" the division of Europe into blocs and hostile alliances; would 
integrate the Soviet Union and the East into a common European family; would 
give the Soviet economy access to Western technology and financial assistance 
and, of course, would almost as a byproduct eliminate a significant U.S. role 
in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
It is not wholly clear at what point Gorbachev realized, as Shevardnadze put 
it, "it is necessary to utilize in depth the potential of a German-Soviet 
economic cooperation." By the time the Soviets understood that the Germans 
could help solve their economic problems, the Germans had already understood 
that there would be no reunification without Soviet support. A marriage of 
convenience was negotiated that promises to help both partners achieve their 
hearts' desires. 
</P>
<P>
Kohl and Genscher made themselves representatives of increased Soviet inclusion 
in international arenas. In addition, Bonn offered financial assistance highly 
favorable to Moscow. It guaranteed a $3 billion credit for the Soviet Union and 
agreed that East Germany would pay approximately $750 million toward the cost 
of supporting 360,000 Soviet troops and their families in East Germany in the 
last six months of 1990, providing Moscow hard currency at a highly subsidized 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
Now Kohl, with French President Francois Mitterrand, has sponsored a proposal 
for $15 billion in Western aid to the Soviets. Next week, Kohl will travel to 
Moscow to report to Gorbachev on progress so far and to appeal for the Soviets 
to drop opposition to German membership in NATO -- which the United States and 
Western Europeans want as their price for supporting German reunification. 
</P>
<P>
But the Soviets' price is likely to be high and some of its terms may be 
ultimately incompatible with meaningful German membership in a meaningful NATO. 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand has been a willing and active participant in the Gorbachev-Kohl 
policy. His own quasi-Gaullist vision of a stable Europe without the blocs 
coincides with Gorbachev's in some crucial ways. They also share a barely 
articulated desire to reduce the role of the United States and NATO in Europe 
and to enhance the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Like Gorbachev, Mitterrand looks toward a Europe for the Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
The desired American contribution to the Gorbachev-Kohl design is now clear -- 
it is for economic aid and a "flexible" policy toward NATO. Where the Bush 
Administration will come out is not yet clear. My own sense is that a 
meaningful long-term role for NATO will not survive the current reconfiguration 
of Europe -- if present trends in the Soviet Union continue -- and that Bush 
cannot join Kohl and Mitterrand in a major financial aid program when the 
Soviets are still spending nearly 20% of their gross national product on the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
But a "no" will not matter that much to the emergence of the new Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Europe is once again absorbed with itself, creating its own complex 
correlations of power. And America is free to go home.

<P>
Hey, you, the one with the pack of Marlboro Reds tucked in your shirt pocket. 
You. Put that cigarette out now! 
</P>
<P>
 It's Wednesday night, you're out for some suds, and at Father's Office in 
Santa Monica, it's no longer OK to smoke and sip. Ever since Tobacco 
Independence Day (also known as July 4), patrons at this 
neighborhood-pub-cum-trendy-beer-bar have been politely asked to leave their 
butts at home one day a week. 
</P>
<P>
Stronger anti-smoking legislation is in the works statewide, and even the 
California Restaurant Assn. is backing a ban on public puffing. 
</P>
<P>
So Father's Office owner Lou Moench is slowly easing in a smoke-free 
environment in the sort of place smokers view as the last bastion of personal 
freedom. To Moench, it goes along with the kind of boutique brew he serves. 
</P>
<P>
"What's the point of serving pure beer if you're going to permit someone to sit 
there and blow arsenic and formaldehyde into the air?" he asks. "Still, in 
deference to some of my old-time day customers who smoke, we will not ban 
smoking entirely." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Taste of Bulgaria 
</P>
<P>
And while we're on the subject of beer, two Bulgarian brewskies have recently 
made their way into the Southern California market. 
</P>
<P>
Both beers are being imported by Alexander Kraychev, a former Bulgarian Olympic 
silver medalist in weight lifting who defected in 1978 and went on to become a 
Long Beach auto mechanic and California real estate investor. He now imports 
about 140,000 cases a month to California. 
</P>
<P>
Astika is described as a "robust, all-malt beer"; Zagorka is "a light, premium 
beer similar to fine German pilsners." Both carry what some may consider a 
heavyweight price: $3.14 for a two-pack; $4.65 for a four-pack. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Even Garbage Isn't Safe 
</P>
<P>
All this beer, of course, comes in recyclable bottles. And California's "bottle 
tax" appears to be giving rise to a new underworld type: the refuse robber. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, which has offered curbside recycling since 1982, 
fly-by-nighters often have the dirtiest part of their work -- sorting garbage 
-- done for them. Well-meaning participants often ignore the city's advice not 
to put out recyclables until the scheduled day of pickup, giving moonlighters 
easy access to treasure guaranteed not by fickle market forces but by the 
California Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica has a law against garbage stealing, said Jon Root, marketing 
specialist for the city's recycling agency. 
</P>
<P>
Although stealing trash to recycle may strike some as less than a serious 
crime, the "cream-skimmers" actually make recycling more costly. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, Root said, the city earned $112,000 last year from selling 
bottles, cans and papers and saved $82,000 more that it would otherwise have 
paid to bury the stuff. But the program still cost the city $567,000 -- leaving 
$373,000 in red ink.

Madonna Concert Canceled: A pop concert by Madonna in Rome this week has been 
abruptly called off. 
</P>
<P>
The cancellation came amid criticisms by Catholic officials against Madonna of 
bad taste in her shows, but organizers said that the July 11 concert was 
canceled because it coincided with a threatened general strike -- which has 
since been called off. Prominent Roman Catholic bodies had attempted to get the 
tour canceled. The Catholic news agency SIR said earlier this week that 
Madonna's use of crucifixes and sacred symbols in concerts and videos was an 
offense to good taste. GREG BRAXTON

Ex-Abba Members File Suit: Two members of the disbanded Swedish pop group Abba 
are suing their former record company for alleged underpayment of millions of 
dollars in royalties. Agnetha Faltskog and Benny Andersson, two members of the 
foursome whose hits in the mid-1970s included "Dancing Queen" and "Fernando," 
say that Polar Music International has not carried out an agreement to increase 
their royalties to 9% from 3% since January, 1983 -- which could amount to $27 
million. GREG BRAXTON

2 Live Crew Fans Rock the House: About 50 fans, angered because the 
controversial rap group 2 Live Crew refused to perform at a Dallas nightclub 
Saturday night, smashed wooden chairs, tables and windows while battling 
security officers. The group, whose album "As Nasty As They Wanna Be" was ruled 
obscene by a Florida judge, was given clearance by a Texas judge to perform at 
the Longhorn Ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
But a dispute over money developed between the band and the nightclub 
management, and the group, headed by Luther Campbell, never came on stage. More 
than three hours after the concert was to begin, witnesses said, an 
unidentified person announced over the public address system at 11:15 that the 
band would not appear if they did not get paid. When the band's stagehands 
began packing up the equipment 20 minutes later, a man demanding a refund 
jumped on stage and was dragged away by security personnel. Patrons then became 
angry, and a ruckus that lasted about 12 minutes erupted. Several people 
suffered minor injuries, but no arrests were reported. GREG BRAXTON

Dangerfield Seeks Respect in Court: A last-ditch effort by attorneys for 
Caesars Palace and Rodney Dangerfield to reach a settlement in a lawsuit that 
the comedian filed against the resort two years ago has ended in failure. A 
trial date will be set Aug. 1. Dangerfield contends his eyes were burned in a 
steam bath accident at Caesars on March 16, 1988, causing him to cancel a 
series of shows at the Las Vegas resort. GREG BRAXTON

COUNTERPUNCH LETTERS;

BETWEEN 'R' AND 'X' LIES A REMEDY FOR RATING ADULT MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Richard D. Heffner makes an important point in his July 2 Counterpunch 
commentary ("Guidance to Parents, Not Profits, Governs Movie Rating System"): 
It will not work to have two ratings symbols that signify "adults only." 
</P>
<P>
How could Heffner's Code and Ratings Administration presume to decide that some 
"adults only" material is art and some porno? This would only create 
nightmarish legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
But it is disingenuous of Heffner to imply that the addition of a new 
exclusionary "adults only" symbol between R and X is the only alternative to 
the present arrangement. A friend who is a staff lawyer at a major Hollywood 
studio has drafted this interesting proposal: 
</P>
<P>
Why not add a new advisory (rather than exclusionary) R-21 rating that would 
bear the same relationship to the current R as PG-13 does to PG -- and which 
would therefore be no more problematic legally? Thinking of the new rating this 
way, rather than as "an additional adults-only category," eliminates the 
artificial complications Heffner has cooked up. 
</P>
<P>
An R-21 rating would not be a perfect solution to the ratings mess. Some 
newspapers and theaters and video stores might still try to make hay by banning 
R-21 pictures. And some films (basically those with hard-core sexual content) 
could still suffer the box-office stigma of the X. But at least this approach 
would be legally unassailable.

LONG SUMMER FOR NEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I agree completely with all points specified and stated by Joseph Papp in his 
July 2 Counterpunch article ("NEA: Once More Unto the Breach"). Again we are 
faced with a "long, hot summer" politically speaking and our lawmakers don't 
know what to do with themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of seeking effective legislation (their appointed task!), they are 
expending vast amounts of energy on such media-hot issues as abortion, 
flag-burning and, of course, censorship. 
</P>
<P>
The recent National Endowment for the Arts debacle is just one more example of 
a string of events triggered by the persistent efforts of a small fraction of 
our population whose aim is to mold our society in order to fit their 
specifications. 
</P>
<P>
The most discouraging thing about all of this is that it seems to be working. 
As a young adult, it is very disheartening to witness such a waste of 
legislative resources when there are a number of more pressing issues that 
demand immediate action. So much for the saying that "youth is a time for 
idealism." The reality of the day makes such thoughts impossible. 
</P>
<P>
I believe in our system; but I don't have any faith in the ability of the 
average American voter to see past all of the "garbage issues" that pollute 
American politics.

Congratulations for publishing "Restaurateurs Give a Second Opinion, and a 
Third, Fourth" (June 25). 
</P>
<P>
It was gratifying to see restaurant owners Robert Bigonnet, Gerald Ferry and 
Jerry Bakalyan respond to the "power" of restaurant critic Ruth Reichl. 
</P>
<P>
I have never had high regard for food critics and seldom read their articles, 
simply because they typically use condemning phrases that "kill" an 
establishment without adequately describing the problem. 
</P>
<P>
A critic's taste and opinion is his, mine is mine, and taste defies 
description. Can you describe the taste of an apple? Orange sorbet has an 
orange taste, lemon sorbet has a lemon taste. 
</P>
<P>
I would expect rose sorbet to taste like roses, or as Ruth Reichl says "iced 
perfume," so why order it? If you like rose sorbet, rate it with rose sorbets 
or roses. Hey! Maybe Chanel No. 5 has a new market outlet.

Recent wildfires have burned 424,571 acres of land across the middle of Alaska, 
but rain has dampened the extreme danger, the Alaska Fire Service reported. 
Lightning sparked 202 separate fires that burned over a wide band of forest 
land and tundra from the Seward Peninsula in western Alaska across hundreds of 
miles to the Canadian border along the eastern edge of the state. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest fire was on 69,000 acres of the Yukon Flats National Wildlife 
Refuge after "an impressive run to the east" nearly doubled the size of that 
blaze over the weekend, said Pete Buist from Bureau of Land Management fire 
headquarters in Fairbanks, Alaska. The town of Tok, Alaska, remained 
uncomfortably close to flames forming a semicircle around the town.

The Pentagon is breaking its own rules by pressing ahead with the purchase of a 
$4-billion electronic radar-jamming device that failed during crucial flight 
tests on fighter planes it is designed to protect, the New York Times reported. 
The Airborne Self-Protection Jammer device has become a test of Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney's ability to adhere to guidelines adopted by the Pentagon 
last summer. These require that major weapons projects pass strict performance 
tests before being purchased by the government, the paper said.

OCEANSIDE CITY HALL RESIGNATIONS HIGHLIGHT TENSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Taken separately, they seemed like such petty offenses -- an offhand remark by 
the police chief, the annoying late arrival to meetings by the redevelopment 
director. 
</P>
<P>
But these incidents and others were like tinder-dry sticks piled on a political 
flame, and the flame roared up publicly when Oceanside City Manager Ronald 
Bradley and Redevelopment Director Kathy Graham abruptly quit in the same week. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with City Council members and political insiders in Oceanside's 
business and development community reveal tension that had been building until 
it broke last month. 
</P>
<P>
Some civic leaders wonder whether Bradley's departure after two years and 
Graham's after only six months mean Oceanside's turbulent politics might settle 
down for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if it's a prelude to Oceanside getting it all together as a team, 
as it has a few times in its history, or a prelude to more political turmoil," 
Councilwoman Lucy Chavez said. 
</P>
<P>
Several business people who deal with the city's redevelopment effort, and who 
spoke on the condition that their names not be used, are cynical about 
Oceanside losing two top officials the week of June 25. 
</P>
<P>
The insiders believe the council has kept such tight reins on city officials 
that initiative and creativity are stifled by political heavy-handedness. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't give them the freedom to do their jobs," said one source with 
financial interests in the redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
While the long-term effect, if any, on city government is unclear, the 
resignations have brightly outlined the bickering and backbiting at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Although a few general reasons have been given for Bradley and Graham leaving, 
there is much more behind the decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who made $101,000 annually, had become worn down by the political 
attacks of some council members on two of his key, hand-picked people, Graham 
and Police Chief Lee Drummond. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, paid $61,800 a year, reportedly came to realize that strife within the 
redevelopment agency and growing dissatisfaction by a council majority left her 
little choice but to move on. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the major factors leading to their resignations: 
</P>
<P>
Bradley was fighting Councilwoman Melba Bishop over Drummond. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop was furious that, after her lone council vote last Feb. 28 against 
buying two police helicopters, Drummond told a briefing room full of officers 
that they should remember how the council voted when reelection time comes 
around in November. 
</P>
<P>
The chief's apparent political threat got back to Bishop, who went to Bradley 
in a futile demand for punishment of the chief. "I told Ron I was upset he 
refused to discipline him. I was real upset," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Those ill feelings have lingered. 
</P>
<P>
Although a council majority still favored keeping Bradley as city manager, 
there was bitterness toward him for announcing publicly last fall that he had 
taken allegations of misconduct against three council members to the district 
attorney's office for investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The three -- Bishop, Sam Williamson and Ben Ramsey -- were cleared after a 
nine-month investigation, but the damage had been done to the relationship 
between the council and their manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost a lot of confidence in his ability to manage people," said Bishop, who 
makes no bones about wanting Bradley gone, especially after "me and my family 
going through nine months of hell." 
</P>
<P>
Williamson flatly denies the incident soured him, and he praised Bradley for 
doing "the job he felt best at the time." 
</P>
<P>
But even Chavez, who wasn't accused of impropriety, said of Bradley, "The 
business of the allegations didn't help him at all." 
</P>
<P>
* Graham began having troubles almost immediately upon her arrival at the 
redevelopment agency, where Patricia Hightman, a 12-year agency veteran who had 
been acting director, was demoted to Graham's second-in-command. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Hightman filed a formal grievance claiming that Graham had 
improperly denied her medical leave. According to sources, the matter was 
resolved when Graham relented and granted the leave. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Bagley said, "It was really a damn near impossible situation from 
the beginning, I think, to demote Pat and bring in somebody over her head and 
expect them to get along." 
</P>
<P>
* The council -- which had been divided in the first place over Graham's hiring 
-- suspected that Graham was negotiating big redevelopment deals on her own, 
without the council's involvement. 
</P>
<P>
"She made the mistake of meeting with the development community and leaving the 
impression you can do things without prior approval of the council," said 
Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
Several council members felt the council was left in the dark, for example, in 
her talks with the developer of the Harbor Hotel, a proposed 400-room hotel, 
200 condos, restaurants and business-conference center at the city's marina. 
</P>
<P>
"What I hear is Kathy was doing some negotiating without the members of the 
(city) negotiating team," Bagley said. 
</P>
<P>
He said she also angered some council members on the team by arriving late to a 
couple of meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Graham was far more popular with the city's business and development leaders 
than with the council. 
</P>
<P>
"She was innovative. When you came to her with an idea, she wouldn't say 'you 
can't do that,' she'd explore the issue," said David Hadsell, chairman of the 
Redevelopment Committee of the Oceanside Chamber of Commerce. "I saw lots of 
bright, fresh ideas when I was dealing with her." 
</P>
<P>
The pre-resignation situation was indicative of the frayed relationships among 
Oceanside's council members. 
</P>
<P>
Bagley largely blames Bishop for making the city manager's job unbearable. "As 
far as pressure on the city manager, it was primarily directed at getting rid 
of the chief of police by one member," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think her primary objective was to get Ron, but I think if she had to 
take Ron to get Lee, she was willing to do it," Bagley said of Bishop. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop countered that the mayor has his own motive for attacking her. 
</P>
<P>
"I dared to run against him for mayor . . . (and) even though he beat me in the 
election, he has never forgiven me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Bradley took his share of heat from the council. 
</P>
<P>
Chavez was upset over his demotion of Hightman, and Williamson raised pointed 
questions about the preparation of the new city budget. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Bagley, Chavez and Williamson felt Bradley was performing well overall 
and he could have stayed in his job had he wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
But, said Bagley, "if you have to spend all of your time covering your fanny, 
it isn't much fun." 
</P>
<P>
He added that Bradley "felt, because of certain pressure he was receiving from 
one or two members, he couldn't accomplish what he wanted as city manager." 
</P>
<P>
On June 25, Bradley announced he was leaving effective Sept. 28 to take a job 
with the nationwide accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young. He was out of town on 
vacation last week and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The council has appointed Deputy City Manager Jim Turner, a 29-year city 
employee, as interim city manager. 
</P>
<P>
Graham has left to became the head of housing and redevelopment in Carlsbad, it 
was announced June 29. She was chosen from a field of 110 applicants and will 
be placed above Patty Cratty, who was the acting redevelopment director. Graham 
did not return a phone call from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Oceanside, Hightman will resume the post of acting redevelopment 
director.

A BANANA BONANZA; 
</P>
<P>
LA CONCHITA YIELDS HARVEST OF THE TROPICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Along the Ventura Freeway near the Ventura and Santa Barbara county line lies a 
small tropical paradise that for years has astonished weather analysts and 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Tucked between the ocean and 300-foot-high bluffs is a place called La 
Conchita, the small seaside community that is also the home of the only 
commercial banana plantation in the continental United States. 
</P>
<P>
There 10,000 banana trees are fanned by balmy ocean breezes, basking in an 
island of frost-free weather. When Ventura freezes over, the Seaside Banana 
Garden is frost-free. When Santa Barbara shivers, bananas at the 12-acre 
plantation ripen on the stalk. 
</P>
<P>
One of the managers of the tiny banana republic is Doug Richardson, 41, an 
occasional landscaper who began cultivating bananas six years ago as an 
experiment in his front yard. He found the banana plants he was growing for 
ground cover were actually producing tasty fruit. In 1985, he decided to grow 
them commercially. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson said that up until then, growing bananas "was unheard of in this 
state." 
</P>
<P>
A geography major at UC Santa Barbara, Richardson had researched temperatures 
in other countries where bananas are traditionally grown. 
</P>
<P>
"What I discovered is that we have a unique climate here," Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
During the next few months of summer, the plantation will enjoy hothouse 
temperatures hovering between 85 degrees and 95 degrees. In winter, when frost 
damages crops 10 miles away in Ventura or Carpinteria, banana trees stay cozy 
in temperatures that are 8 to 15 degrees higher, Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson's partner, Paul Turner, 43, said he was skeptical at first. But 
old-timers told him they had never seen a frost in La Conchita. Then he learned 
that the plantation has higher temperatures than the Canary Islands off the 
coast of Africa. "I figured that if they can do it there, we could do it too," 
Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
The farm produces 10 to 20 tons of bananas per acre every year, compared to 25 
to 30 tons on other banana plantations. Two years ago, the two were quoted as 
saying that they hoped to gross about $200,000. But today both Richardson and 
Turner are more circumspect about what they garner from nearly a quarter of a 
million pounds of bananas sold every year. 
</P>
<P>
Although they declined to reveal revenues, both said they are barely breaking 
even after five years of farming. Last year, they planted seven more acres, an 
expansion that is not expected to begin producing until next year. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural officials and other farmers acknowledged that the plantation is an 
environmental oddity. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to grow bananas on the Oxnard Plain and they froze," said Rob Brokaw, 
a grower who also specializes in rare and exotic fruits. Richardson "is growing 
a crop that is not supposed to exist out of the tropics." 
</P>
<P>
The main reason the plantation does so well in the winter is that the ocean -- 
with its temperate currents only a few hundred yards away -- maintains a 
moderate temperature, said Bob Brendler, an adviser with University of 
California Cooperative Extension. 
</P>
<P>
The moderate air coming off the ocean moves up the area's steep slopes, 
breaking up any stagnant, freezing-cold air. In summer, ocean breezes bathe the 
area with cool, humid air, mimicking the climate of the tropics. 
</P>
<P>
But the plantation is not unique, as its operators believe, Brendler said. 
Dozens of other islands of peculiarly warm weather, known as microclimates, can 
be found around the county, he said. Farmers interested in growing tropical 
fruits are discovering they too can cultivate exotic crops. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson and Turner themselves admit that their La Conchita plantation is not 
the only hot spot in the county. They found another in Carpinteria where they 
grow bananas, but the crop yield is much smaller. 
</P>
<P>
Word of Ventura County's banana plantation has reached the Washington-based 
International Banana Assn., which promotes bananas for a dozen member companies 
around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Moore, the top banana of the association, called the farm a "climatic 
nonconformity." 
</P>
<P>
Banana plantations are usually located in subtropical climates where the 
temperatures rarely dip below 55 degrees, Moore said. Banana farming was 
previously thought impossible in California, and certainly in areas far away 
from the porous volcanic soil that plants favor, he said. But Seaside Banana 
Garden has changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very unusual spot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the banana farm's success goes beyond climatological luck. Seaside 
Banana Garden requires intensive agricultural methods. For instance, instead of 
relying on tropical rainfall, the two farmers have planted drought-resistant 
varieties of banana tubers and lined the groves with black irrigation pipes. 
</P>
<P>
Every stalk of bananas is covered with a bright blue plastic bag to speed the 
ripening process and prevent damage from the leaves. Each banana tree is 
hand-cultivated by a crew of six workers. New small trees are placed in pots. 
</P>
<P>
Soon the plantation will take on a new venture, producing an experimental patch 
of pineapples, now growing in small pots under the hot sun. 
</P>
<P>
Known in the small one-supermarket community of La Conchita as the "banana 
guys," Turner and Richardson take more than a passing interest in talking to 
the dozens of tourists who stop by to buy bananas at a small thatched hut 
Richardson built near the Ventura Freeway between March and November. Tourists 
like to hear about the wide variety of bananas grown at the farm, they said. 
</P>
<P>
But at $1 to $4 a pound, the bananas are not cheap. They are available only in 
exclusive organic food stores and pricey restaurants across the country. But 
that has not prevented Midwestern yuppies, New York delicatessens and fancy Los 
Angeles eateries from ordering them through overnight mail. 
</P>
<P>
Although they still have not tallied the number of mail order buyers, the two 
men said that most of them are not looking for exotic varieties and can afford 
to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Volent, for one, said he has developed a taste for exotic breeds of 
bananas and has a standing order of one 40-pound box of bananas delivered to 
his Santa Fe, N.M. home every month. Each box costs him $35. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson and Turner say one of their plans is to turn the plantation into a 
roadside attraction where a guide would lead groups on a 20-minute tour through 
the groves, explaining the origin of banana plants. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, neither Richardson nor Turner want to go so far as turning their 
plantation into a tropical Knott's Berry Farm. "It could become an A-1 tourist 
trap," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're occupied in our farm," Richardson said. "We're just down-and-dirty 
farmers."

CITY MAY BUY APARTMENTS TO HOUSE POOR; 
</P>
<P>
LIVING SPACE: S.D. HOUSING COMMISSION ADVANCES A NOVEL FUNDING SCHEME TO BUY 
800 UNITS FOR THE NEEDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Wes Pratt moved to San Diego in 1976 to study law at UC San Diego, he 
settled into a $220-a-month apartment in a federally subsidized complex in 
Rancho Penasquitos. Pratt's family later moved to another subsidized project in 
Clairemont, closer to where his wife worked. 
</P>
<P>
The apartment houses -- Penasquitos Gardens and Mount Aguilar -- served as 
"transitional housing . . . that gave us time to find a house," said Pratt, who 
arrived from Springfield, Mo., and is now a San Diego city councilman. 
</P>
<P>
Pratt has fond memories of the apartment complexes, in part because one of his 
daughters was born while his family was living at the Clairemont facility. 
</P>
<P>
But Pratt, a strong proponent of public housing who sits on the San Diego 
Housing Commission's Board of Directors, now is worried that 800 low- and 
below-average income families living in two subsidized projects could be forced 
out of their rent-controlled apartments because of a federal government policy 
allowing a building's owner to sell the projects or increase rents to market 
rates. It is a problem facing communities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
"Because I've personally resided in those particular projects I know the types 
of individuals who live there," Pratt said. "The issue before us is a 
legitimate one. . . . They're in danger . . . and San Diego could lose 
subsidized housing." 
</P>
<P>
The potential loss is even more critical in San Diego, which has one of the 
most expensive rental markets in the country, said Evan Becker, executive 
director of the San Diego Housing Commission. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the agency wants to buy the two complexes for $38.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 800 units in question are among 3,000 in San Diego built during the late 
1960s and early 1970s by private developers who were awarded low-interest 
federal loans. 
</P>
<P>
Developers used the loans, some of which carried interest rates as low as 1% or 
2%, to build rent-controlled housing for low-income families that didn't 
qualify for traditional public housing because they earned too much money. 
</P>
<P>
If the housing commission buys the facilities, each family will be asked to pay 
30% of its total income in rent. That formula will cause rent hikes for some 
tenants but will actually reduce rents for others, Becker said. The housing 
commission hopes to offer federal rent vouchers to tenants who are unable to 
meet the 30% level. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, an estimated 1 million people live in the 365,000 units built 
through the federal Housing and Urban Development's loan-assistance program. 
Private developers built about 33,000 units in California alone, with most of 
the units clustered in the southern part of the state. 
</P>
<P>
The loans were structured to be paid back over 40 years. But that changed when 
Congress decided to allow developers to 
</P>
<P>
prepay their loans after 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
When the first of those prepayments occurred during the late 1980s, housing 
experts grew concerned that the nation would be hit by a growing wave of loan 
prepayments and a subsequent wave of newly displaced low-income Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The threat of prepayments has become a fact of life around the country. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of the 200-unit Meadowbrook Apartment I complex on Paradise Valley 
Road in San Diego already has advised the housing commission she will prepay 
the federal government loan "in order to achieve the financial objectives of 
the investment. . . . The project will be operated as an investment property 
and current market rental rates will be charged." 
</P>
<P>
The planned prepayment at the Meadowbrook complex, however, is on hold because 
of a 1987 Congressional ban that put most prepayments on hold until this 
September. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the ban is extended, prepayments are likely to occur around the country, 
public housing proponents fear. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a loan prepayment is likely for a complex built at Venice Beach in 
Los Angeles, said Rich West, spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based National 
Low Income Housing Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
The property owner stands to make "a real windfall" by pushing out low-income 
residents and increasing rents to fair-market rates, West said. 
</P>
<P>
That's what happened in 1987 in the San Francisco Bay area city of Alameda. The 
property owner prepaid his federal loan on a 465-unit apartment complex and 
immediately doubled rents, said Buck Bagot, executive director of the San 
Francisco-based Nonprofit Housing Assn. of Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
The landlord eventually agreed to gradually phase in the new rates and housing 
agencies arranged partial subsidies for some tenants. But the prepayment 
"definitely led to displacements and homelessness," Bagot said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents fought the increased rents at every step, according to Modessa 
Henderson, a 13-year tenant who was threatened with displacement. "If we got to 
go to the streets, we decided to go like lions, not like sheep," said 
Henderson, who has been able to remain in her apartment despite paying $625 a 
month, up from $271. 
</P>
<P>
Housing advocates maintain that failure by Congress to extend the prepayment 
ban will allow many apartment owners to prepay their loans and sell the 
projects -- an option that could generate cash windfalls. Or, owners will be 
free to toss out the low-income tenants and rent the units at a fair market 
price that might be four to five times higher than current rents. 
</P>
<P>
In either case, low-income housing proponents believe hundreds of thousands of 
American families will be pushed into homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
The need for Congressional action is "critical," West said. Allowing owners to 
prepay their loans "will affect the housing for low-income people for decades. 
. . . It would significantly worsen America's housing crisis, and California is 
particularly at risk because a lot of these low-income units are in 
neighborhoods that are now quite desirable," West said. 
</P>
<P>
The likelihood of a loan being prepaid is directly tied to its location, Becker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the owner of a low-income housing project in an embattled 
neighborhood such as Southeast San Diego probably wouldn't be able to increase 
his or her profits by selling out or increasing rents, Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
But that isn't the case in Rancho Penasquitos and Clairemont, where the 
projects are in desirable areas, and real estate values have escalated 
dramatically since the late 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Becker said Al Malnik, the principal owner of the two properties, has the 
option of prepaying his loan next spring and either selling the projects or 
renting the units at a fair-market rate of $600 a month, double the current 
$300. 
</P>
<P>
But Malnik has tentatively agreed to sell the two projects for $38.5 million to 
a nonprofit corporation to be founded by the housing commission. The nonprofit 
agency would be governed by a board that includes representatives from the 
public, the housing commission and the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Independent appraisals conducted for the housing commission and Malnik set the 
value of the two properties at between $23 million and $51 million, depending 
on when rent restrictions are lifted. 
</P>
<P>
While Malnik has agreed to sell his properties, the deal hinges upon a complex 
funding package that includes state and federal loans as well as the proceeds 
from the sale of tax credits and tax-free bonds. 
</P>
<P>
If completed, the deal would "allow us to obtain these units and rehabilitate 
them with low-interest state loans," Becker said. "We believe it is more 
economical and efficient to do it this way as opposed to constructing 800 new 
units." 
</P>
<P>
But the high price has some council members, such as Mayor Maureen O'Connor and 
Bruce Henderson, concerned that the $38 million payment might be a "windfall" 
to Malnik that isn't in the city's best interest. 
</P>
<P>
Malnik "may be clean as a whistle, but it would embarrass me to hand (him) this 
huge profit," Henderson said at a recent council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor urged the housing commission to investigate the possibility of buying 
distressed properties from the federal Resolution Trust Corp., the government 
entity created to sell off assets owned by the nation's troubled financial 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor also suggested the $47,000-per-apartment cost was too high because 
the units are 20 years old. 
</P>
<P>
But Becker maintained the units are "in good condition . . . and they are in 
very good locations." The housing commission intends to renovate the projects, 
when necessary, by using low-cost rehabilitation loans available from the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
He said the proposed buyout is a cost-effective solution to the city's growing 
shortage of affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the housing commission is paying "well over $100,000" per unit to 
build three- and five-room apartments in North City West, Becker said. The 
commission is also paying between $75,000 and $95,000 to acquire two- and 
three-room apartments elsewhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The potential value of federally subsidized projects has not escaped savvy 
investors, who in recent years have been acquiring projects with the 
anticipation of earning windfall profits once the prohibition on loan 
prepayments expires. 
</P>
<P>
That angers public housing advocates who argue Congress never intended the 
low-cost loans to generate such windfalls for developers. 
</P>
<P>
"What's really piggy is that these (developers) built projects with tremendous 
federal government subsidies, and there's no way they could have planned on the 
cost of housing in California increasing by 600%," said Bagot, the affordable 
housing advocate. "Now these folks are upset that we want to control 
unreasonable windfalls." 
</P>
<P>
Becker said that housing commissions around the country are looking to 
Washington for a solution. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Bush Administration "has not come to the table with (a solution) 
because they're afraid of how big the bill will be," Becker said. However, 
housing experts cautioned that delay will only cause the price tag to increase.

IN EDEN GARDENS, PARADISE REGAINED COULD BE LOST TO NEW TEMPTATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Alice Granados sat at a concrete picnic table in sunny La Colonia Park, 
recalling the darker days in Eden Gardens when the drugs, stabbings and 
prostitution made her neighborhood anything but a garden of eden. 
</P>
<P>
Those were the ugly times, when the hookers used to service a dozen men each in 
an afternoon from the stalls of the park's public restroom. There were days 
when the drug dealers were so thick in the largely Latino neighborhood that 
timid residents couldn't drive past without one of them pushing his wares 
against their closed car windows. 
</P>
<P>
That was 1988, the year, Eden Gardens residents proudly say, when they took 
back their streets, their park and their neighborhood from the pushers, the 
pimps and the prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
They formed a community action group to report drug sales -- sometimes alerting 
authorities to their own family members -- and successfully lobbied Solana 
Beach officials to have the county Sheriff's Department begin foot patrols in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
But now the neighborhood finds that its success comes at a price: Suddenly, 
when no one was looking, Eden Gardens became hot property. 
</P>
<P>
Recent real estate purchases in Eden Gardens, homeowners say, are threatening 
to dilute the distinctive Latino culture residents have spent more than three 
generations cultivating. 
</P>
<P>
These days, residents are less apt to be on the telephone reporting a drug deal 
than they are fending off the offers of up to half a million dollars that have 
begun pouring into their newly revitalized community. 
</P>
<P>
One by one, Mexican families are selling their homes and moving out of Eden 
Gardens. Some have been driven out by higher taxes. Others have decided to cash 
in on lucrative offers for their properties. 
</P>
<P>
The result: Charming haciendas are being replaced by apartment buildings and 
pricey new condos, locking out the newest Eden Gardens generation from buying 
homes in the community where they grew up. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when Hispanics owned all this," Alice Granados said, looking 
up at the red-tiled roofs that dot the hillside just west of Interstate 5 near 
Lomas Santa Fe. "You get a little heartbroken when you see your neighbors, your 
relatives, packing up to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"You want the place to stay the same, like it always has. But you can't talk 
them out of it. It's just sad to sit by and watch as a community loses its 
spirit and its soul." 
</P>
<P>
For years, Eden Gardens has been recognized as a sort of North County anomaly, 
a close-knit Mexican barrio sandwiched between some of the most expensive real 
estate in Southern California: Rancho Santa Fe and the Pacific coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Settled in the 1920s by Mexican laborers who tended the huge estates of nearby 
Rancho Santa Fe, Eden Gardens quickly became a neighborhood with distinct 
boundaries and family ties. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike surrounding Solana Beach, a city with no real downtown or community 
center, it was a community with a there there. 
</P>
<P>
In Eden Gardens, everyone was either a son or a daughter, a cousin, nephew or 
niece to his or her neighbor. Residents took pride in their cluster of 
authentic Mexican restaurants, including Fidel's, Tony's Jacal, and the 
Bluebird and Market cafes. 
</P>
<P>
They were especially proud of the streets with Latino surnames, named for the 
original settlers; of the occasional mailbox painted the red, green and white 
of the Mexican flag, and of tiny St. Leo's Mission, the church they built from 
the ground up, where most services are still said in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
In fiercely guarding its Latino heritage in the midst of Solana Beach's 
affluent white-collar suburbia, Eden Gardens has repeatedly tapped into its 
deeply rooted community spirit to combat crime, drug use and citizen apathy. 
</P>
<P>
"The place has turned around," said Norm Berg, a Solana Beach real estate 
agent. "While some people still see it as a Mexican barrio, others look at Eden 
Gardens and see opportunity. Properties are changing hands there." 
</P>
<P>
Now, not a week passes when Martha Castallanos doesn't receive a letter, phone 
call or unsolicited visit from investors eyeing her tiny one-story home on 
Hernandez Street. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a day not too long ago when parents would tell their daughters, 
'Don't you dare go to Eden Gardens, they'll rape you and steal your car.' And 
they weren't far from the truth," said Castallanos, who moved to the 
neighborhood in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we get calls all the time from people who want to buy our property. It's 
funny, our pastor told us 25 years ago, 'Hold on to your little pieces of land. 
Some day they'll be worth a million dollars.' And he wasn't too far from the 
truth." 
</P>
<P>
Sensing the neighborhood's comeback, the city of Solana Beach is ready to begin 
investing in Eden Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, the city will begin constructing an $800,000 neighborhood center in 
La Colonia Park that officials hope will continue to lure local residents back 
into the area. 
</P>
<P>
In the years to come, officials say, Eden Gardens -- with its popular 
restaurants and Latino flair -- could become a draw for both residents and 
tourists alike. 
</P>
<P>
"It's another step to bring Eden Gardens into the mainstream," said Solana 
Beach City Manager Michael Huse. "The neighborhood represents Solana Beach's 
past, the way this city used to look. Who knows, one day Eden Gardens could 
become the Old Town of Solana Beach." 
</P>
<P>
But some residents -- and some City Council members -- aren't sure they want 
Eden Gardens to become like San Diego's Old Town. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any real Mexicans living in Old Town anymore, are 
there?" said Councilwoman Celine Olson. "Unlike Old Town, we don't want to 
drive out the real Mexicans just to bring in the pseudo-Mexicans. We like the 
restaurants just the way they are -- owned by real Mexicans." 
</P>
<P>
Even Olson isn't sure how long Eden Gardens can retain its original character. 
Like others, she has seen the new apartment buildings multiply and the 
oversize, newly built homes and condos beginning to crowd out the quaint 
red-roofed homes built 60 and 70 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Anglos are buying in by the droves," she said, "and so the character of that 
neighborhood will inevitably change. But I'll tell you one thing: There will be 
a great resistance on this council to any new development that would spoil the 
character of Eden Gardens." 
</P>
<P>
That character -- indeed, even the neighborhood's very name -- was instilled 
early. Martha Castallanos recalls the late 1920s, when her father worked in the 
groves of Rancho Santa Fe, when no one owned a car and few people cared about 
having one. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like paradise, everyone was like a family," she said. For years, she 
said, she was related in some way to every single person on her street. "That's 
when people started to call it Eden Gardens." 
</P>
<P>
But there were troubled times as well. In the 1930s, Mexican schoolchildren in 
the neighborhood were segregated from whites. "We didn't care," Castallanos 
said. "We'd rather have been with Mexican children from our own neighborhood 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Vera Rodriguez, another longtime neighborhood resident and Castallanos' aunt, 
said the young were blind to the racism they encountered when they left Eden 
Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
"We always had to sit in the balcony at the La Paloma Theater in Encinitas," 
she said. "I always thought it was because we could see better up there. Now I 
realize they didn't want the Mexicans sitting down below." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, things changed in Eden Gardens -- for better and worse. The pool 
halls either closed down or became restaurants like the Bluebird Cafe. In the 
1960s, I-5 sliced through the heart of Eden Gardens, shrinking it to its 
present one square mile. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the 1970s and '80s, Eden Gardens got hooked on drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Cocaine and heroin were regularly dealt out of houses, apartment buildings and 
right on the street, by locals and later by illegal aliens who moved into the 
neighborhood. When La Colonia Park was built in the late 1970s, it became the 
focal point of the neighborhood's drug scene. 
</P>
<P>
But the worst of it, Alice Granados said, was the refuse the druggies and their 
kind left behind. On some mornings, local children would use the syringes and 
used condoms they found in the bushes and on the sidewalks to mimic the illicit 
activities they witnessed day after day in the Solana Beach neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd see these little children holding hypodermic needles, trying to imitate 
the people they saw using drugs," said Granados, a grandmother of five. "They'd 
stumble around, their eyes half-closed, their speech slurred. You didn't have 
to know the children to be struck with how sad the situation had become." 
</P>
<P>
"It was terrible," recalled resident Al Gonzales. "You kept asking yourself, 
'Who's next? Who's going to start using now?' " 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Gonzales was among two dozen citizens who gathered at St. Leo's 
Mission. The meeting eventually led them to form Eden Gardens Against Drugs, 
and residents went to work on their telephones, reporting drug deals. 
</P>
<P>
No longer was Eden Gardens a scared and silent little community, too timid to 
turn in one of its own. Sons and cousins went to jail, Granados now says, so 
that on this bright weekday morning, she and her neighbors could again enjoy 
the suburban beauty of La Colonia Park. 
</P>
<P>
"You hated to point the finger at a relative," she said. "But we just got tired 
of seeing people shoot up in our back yards. And we realized that to get the 
job done, we had to do it together, not alone. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to pick up the telephone and report people we knew well. And we did it. 
Our kids can play soccer in this park again. Families can have picnics here. 
It's a lot sunnier around here these days." 
</P>
<P>
While the dealers have moved underground, problems remain. 
</P>
<P>
Last fall, a sheriff's sting operation made numerous drug arrests at an 
apartment complex near La Colonia Park. And uniformed patrolmen walk 
neighborhood streets, looking for tips from residents who watch for a new drug 
flare-up. 
</P>
<P>
But signs of new life abound in Eden Gardens. Residents like to say they've 
reestablished Eden Gardens' reputation. 
</P>
<P>
That's the way Doug DeJardine likes it. 
</P>
<P>
DeJardine, a sergeant for the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, was 
assigned to patrol Eden Gardens in the early 1970s. He soon fell in love with 
the strong-shouldered ethnic neighborhood, which he says reminded him of his 
upbringing in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's my kind of place," said DeJardine, who has since been reassigned. "Sure, 
there were some dark years. But Eden Gardens is family. The people there are 
authentic folks. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though it's still a barrio of sorts, it's got soul. It's a recognizable 
place with distinct boundaries. I mean, you know you're in Eden Gardens the 
moment you set foot in the place. Where else in North County can you say that?"

ALL-WOMAN FIRE CREW A 1ST FOR CYA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Among the hundreds of firefighters who heroically battled the disastrous fires 
in Santa Barbara and Ojai recently, this crew of 16 hardly stood out. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, they were making history as the first all-female crew from the California 
Youth Authority to be dispatched to fight fires. 
</P>
<P>
When the fires were contained, the women, 18 to 22 years old, returned to the 
prison at Camarillo's Ventura School, where they are incarcerated. 
</P>
<P>
The women spent nearly two rigorous months training to become firefighters at 
the nearby Ventura Public Service and Fire Center Program. 
</P>
<P>
Selected by a prison screening board, the female firefighters must have between 
four and 24 months remaining to serve, said Cynthia Brown, program 
superintendent. That's so they can put their training to use for at least one 
fire season. Those convicted of arson or sex offenses are not allowed in the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The first training phase consists of physical conditioning, including 
weightlifting, running, hill-climbing and other cardiovascular and strength 
exercises. The program's second phase is a one-week classroom course covering 
types of fires, firefighting techniques and safety, potential risks and how to 
avoid them. 
</P>
<P>
The women receive $5.50 a week for the first 30 days of the program. Pay can 
range up to $8.50 a week for seasoned members. In addition, they receive $1 an 
hour for each hour spent fighting a fire. Some earned as much as $200 fighting 
fires in Ojai and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the women are still battling physical and emotional exhaustion from 
seven straight days of battling the two blazes, they spend at least four hours 
each weekday clearing brush from the dry hills surrounding Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
Some don't like it. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate this," said Kianya Fleming, 18, after a brush-clearing session in 
90-degree temperatures last week. It's not the hard work she minds, but the 
fact that prison officials gave her no choice but to join the crew, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't treat us right," Fleming said. "They expect us to do as much work 
as the boys, but the boys always come first." Fleming and others complained 
that members of CYA's four other fire crews, all male, seem to receive 
preferential treatment such as trips to movies or restaurants, a television in 
their ward, and more free time. 
</P>
<P>
Prison officials said the program, which started in March, is still new and 
they are still working to get some details in place. 
</P>
<P>
Other crew members, however, said the challenge of firefighting beats sitting 
in prison with little to do. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Stark, 20, hopes to become a professional firefighter when her prison 
term ends in a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon Byrket, 22, said she likes the hard work -- and the hot temperatures. 
"I don't mind it," she said. "I grew up in the high desert, so I know about 
heat." ADRIANNE GOODMAN

BASE'S 'BETSY ROSS' FIXES TATTERED FLAGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rarely a day goes by without Darla Figueroa glancing at one of the flags 
flapping over the Naval Construction Battalion Center in Port Hueneme and 
wondering whether its seams are still intact. 
</P>
<P>
Known to co-workers as a modern-day Betsy Ross, Figueroa, 34, is not one to 
stand for tattered flags. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't even have to be badly ripped," said Figueroa, a security clerk at 
the construction center. "Someone else might not even notice it needs mending, 
but I can't resist the urge to do some fixing." 
</P>
<P>
Figueroa is the base's unofficial flag mender. Since 1985, when she first 
volunteered to trim the frayed edges of the nation's symbol, Figueroa estimates 
that she has fixed about 15 flags. 
</P>
<P>
She began mending flags as a favor for her husband, Chief Master of Arms Luis 
Figueroa, CBC's assistant security officer. He is responsible for maintaining 
the department's three flags. 
</P>
<P>
"He brought one home one day and asked me if I would mind fixing it," Figueroa 
said. "He's been bringing them home ever since." 
</P>
<P>
Her efforts have saved the Navy about $800, she said. Without mending, the 
flags would probably have been burned in accordance with military protocol. 
</P>
<P>
In an era when the military is facing steep cuts in defense spending, Figueroa 
said she is pleased that her efforts are able to save the Navy some money. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easier and cheaper for me to spend 10 minutes fixing a seam than throwing 
it out or paying a lot of money to have someone else do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Figueroa began sewing in junior high school and has made clothes for her 
family. Since moving to Port Mugu in 1982, when her husband was transferred 
from Long Beach, she said she hasn't had as much time for sewing as she would 
like. The demands of caring for her family and holding a full-time job take 
most of her effort, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Since making it known that she enjoys mending flags, Figueroa's co-workers have 
begun to call her the "Betsy Ross of the '90s." "I didn't do it for the 
recognition. I just thought it would be a nice thing to do," she said. CAROLYN

JOHS ANNOUNCES BID FOR REELECTION

<TEXT>
<P>
Saying the city still needs a voice calling for fiscal responsibility, Oxnard 
Councilwoman Ann Johs announced Friday that she will seek her second four-year 
term on the council. 
</P>
<P>
Johs is the first council incumbent to announce her decision to seek reelection 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Nao Takasugi's two-year term and Councilman Manuel Lopez's four-year term 
expire this year. 
</P>
<P>
The filing period begins July 16 and closes Aug. 10. 
</P>
<P>
Johs, who was the Oxnard Chamber of Commerce's first woman president in 1980, 
was elected to fill a term left uncompleted after Councilman Tsujio Kato was 
recalled in 1984. She was reelected for a full term in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Johs said she sought a council seat because she felt the council was not doing 
enough to keep businesses in the city. Johs said she has been accessible to the 
public and has spoken out on fiscal responsibility by voting against pay raises 
when she felt that they were gratuitous. 
</P>
<P>
If reelected, Johs said she will continue to try to improve the city's 
financial standing, work to relieve its traffic problems and improve air 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
Johs suggested last month that the city, facing budget constraints, consider 
eliminating its police and fire departments and turning those services over to 
the county. The proposal was rejected in a 3-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
Paul K. Dolan, a distribution contractor, and Scott Bollinger, a self-employed 
investor, announced in May that they would seek election to the council. HUGO

<P>
CRIME: NO HOMES HAVE BURNED AND NO ONE HAS BEEN INJURED IN THE MOSTLY SMALL 
BLAZES THAT HAVE RECENTLY STRUCK THE AREA. BUT ANXIOUS RESIDENTS SAY THEY FEEL 
AS THOUGH THEY ARE BEING HELD CAPTIVE BY ARSONISTS.

Francie Neeley anxiously scans the horizon and smells the air for hints of 
smoke. Mary Ann Floyd is afraid to leave home for long, fearful that it might 
not be there when she returns. And Ginger Rohaley and her husband plan to 
finally replace their home's wood shingle roof with one that is fire resistant. 
</P>
<P>
These cautious actions are but a few of the ways Leona Valley residents are 
coping with a rash of deliberately set fires that have seared the area's 
brush-covered hillsides in the past two weeks. Frightened residents said they 
feel as if their quiet, rural community is being held captive by arsonists. 
</P>
<P>
For many in this Antelope Valley community, a collection of widely scattered 
farms and ranch houses 10 miles west of Palmdale, the siege has provided 
residents with a cruel reminder that their peaceful lifestyle does not shelter 
them from crime. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as crime goes, our biggest thing has been trash dumping. People think, 
'Arson doesn't happen in the Leona Valley. That only happens in the city,' " 
said Floyd, a community activist and eight-year resident. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shock and it's left us feeling on pins and needles," she said. "This is 
a crime, and it's a major crime. It affects us as a community. And when the 
realization occurs to us that we're vulnerable to crime, it's really a shock." 
</P>
<P>
No homes have been burned and no one has been injured in the seven mostly small 
fires that have struck the area since June 28. Most fires have charred less 
than 20 acres, although one grew to almost 200. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Leona Valley blazes, five others have been set in 
surrounding areas. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies arrested one man on suspicion of setting two of the earliest 
fires. But even after the arrest the blazes continued, the latest erupting last 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Most have broken out in brush along some of the area's few major roads. On June 
29, for instance, two fires were set four miles apart within minutes of each 
other on Elizabeth Lake Road, resulting in the 200-acre blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators as well as residents believe the arsonist might be commuting 
through the area, or be someone who at least knows the terrain. 
</P>
<P>
No incendiary devices have been recovered and investigators continue to look 
for leads. Deputies on patrol hope to catch someone in the act of setting a 
fire. Residents are pitching in too. Last week they organized the Leona Valley 
Fire Busters Patrol to watch for suspicious-looking people or cars. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd and other residents who volunteered for the patrols said it is easy to 
notice strangers in their small community, where most people know one another 
and the types of cars their neighbors own. Residents began their patrols in 
cars Thursday, Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been at the mercy of some person who is parking on our roadways and 
setting fires. It's just a feeling of somebody else being in control of our 
lives and our homes," Floyd said. "We wanted to let the bad guys know they 
can't come into our town and burn it down." 
</P>
<P>
Residents expressed frustration when they grappled with the unsettling question 
of why the fires have been set at all. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the great big question in red capital letters," said Neeley, a college 
professor and three-year valley resident. 
</P>
<P>
"This has put an undue and unnecessary pressure on all of us who live up here. 
And it's made us damn mad," said Gloria Gossard, a free-lance writer and 
longtime Leona Valley resident. Gossard said she canceled a trip to the 
Sacramento area last week because of concern over the fires. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the widespread fears, the blazes have had the positive effect of 
increasing awareness of fire dangers in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said this Fourth of July was the first they could remember that was 
virtually free of illegal fireworks because of the heightened sense of fire 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
Some residents have been trimming the brush and shrubs around their ranches and 
farms as an extra precaution. And Rohaley, calling her house "built to burn," 
said the recent fires have spurred her and her husband to buy a fire-resistant 
metal roof that they had long been considering. 
</P>
<P>
"This really changes your priorities when things like this are going on," said 
Rohaley, a 14-year resident in the area. She and neighbor JoAnn Sharkey know 
fires well. Rohaley nearly lost her house in a major Leona Valley brush fire 
four years ago that destroyed Sharkey's house. 
</P>
<P>
That fire, which began when debris-burning got out of control, forced the 
Sharkey family to live in a trailer for nearly a year while rebuilding their 
hillside house. Last week, Sharkey uneasily watched the smoke from one of the 
distant arsons. "I don't want to leave the house," she said later.

NIGHT WATCHMAN SLAIN ON TUNA BOAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 69-year-old night watchman was found stabbed to death early Sunday morning 
after an apparent robbery aboard a tuna boat at the G Street pier, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Joseph Ferreira Fernandes, a retired commercial fisherman who 
worked as a night watchman aboard the seiner Sea Quest, was found by the 
morning watchman about 6:30 a.m., covered in blood, San Diego Police Sgt. 
Michael Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandes, who lived in San Diego with his wife, had been stabbed in the chest. 
His car, usually parked at the pier, was missing. 
</P>
<P>
When the morning watchman arrived shortly before 6 a.m. to relieve Fernandes, 
he became alarmed when he could not find him, according to police. He called 
his supervisor, and the two men searched the vessel, which is docked at 600 
Harbor Drive. They found Fernandes at the port-side bulkhead in a fish storage 
area, hidden beneath plastic sheathing and ship equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandes apparently was attacked in the ship's galley and his body dropped to 
the lower deck, Sgt. Fred England said. The San Diego Unified Port District 
Police diving team was dispatched to search the waters for the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know of any incident like this, and I have been around for 30 years," 
said August Felando, president of the American Tunaboat Assn. 
</P>
<P>
With more transients on San Diego streets, he said, more arrive at the pier 
area, and most vessels, such as the Sea Quest, have watchmen and sometimes dogs 
to guard equipment. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Quest, which is owned by Manuel Silva of San Diego, arrived at the G 
Street pier within the past two weeks. It is one of a declining number of tuna 
boats. In 1955, there were 249 such vessels in the United States; now there are 
only 65, and all but 16 are owned by San Diegans. 
</P>
<P>
The industry has been hit hard by an April 12 announcement by three major 
canners -- StarKist, Chicken of the Sea and Bumble Bee -- to buy only tuna that 
is caught without harming dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
The death of Fernandes is "just another sad event for people associated with 
this industry," Felando said.

VIETNAMESE ARTISTS DEPICT VISIONS OF THEIR HOMELAND IN NEW SETTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Black ink slashes white silk, and a lost world emerges. 
</P>
<P>
A water buffalo dips one curved horn into a rice paddy. An ancient woman 
clutches a bowl. A mother comforts her child, touching her cheek to his smaller 
one in a gesture of infinite tenderness. 
</P>
<P>
These spare brush strokes made Be Ky a celebrity in the Saigon art world at the 
age of 18. Six months ago, she and her husband Ho Thanh Duc, a renowned 
collagist, joined a tiny but productive community of Vietnamese artists in 
exile in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
And now their focal point is a gallery in Burbank. It is owned by a young 
etcher, Nguyen Viet, who has been trying to introduce paintings and sculpture 
by Vietnamese refugees to the American market. 
</P>
<P>
Their works range from traditional brush-and-ink drawings to primitivist 
sketches, modern acrylics and post-modernist etching. Some are fierce, such as 
Ho Thanh Duc's marbled collages of a anguished Christ. Others are sentimental. 
Yet the artists express common themes: melancholy, nostalgia and transcendence. 
</P>
<P>
Westerners should not "think of Vietnam as a just a war-torn country," said 
Nguyen Thi Hop, 46, who layers watercolor onto silk to produce ethereal scenes 
of rural life a century ago. "I want to show them that the other side of 
Vietnam is beautiful and poetic." 
</P>
<P>
If the art is serene, the artists' lives have not been. 
</P>
<P>
Be Ky and her husband were both war orphans. At the age of 12 she went to live 
with an abusive artist who recognized her talent and exploited it. 
</P>
<P>
"He taught me very little, and I learned a lot from other people . . ." Be Ky 
said through an interpreter at Studio Gallery and Framing Inc. in Burbank, 
where her recent paintings are hung. "I had to hide my paintings from him." 
</P>
<P>
By 16, her adoptive father had her hawking her ink caricatures on the streets 
of Saigon. "If I earned a lot of money, I brought it home and they were very 
happy. But if the money was little, they would beat me up." 
</P>
<P>
A French art critic came across her sketches and arranged a one-woman show for 
the 18-year-old. It sold out. Fame brought more exhibitions in Paris and Tokyo, 
but relations with her adoptive father deteriorated. One day, she said, she 
discovered that he had been forging her name on his paintings to bring a higher 
price for them on the street. 
</P>
<P>
When she confronted him, he struck her across the head, leaving her deaf in one 
ear. Nearly 30 years later it was that disability that finally persuaded 
Vietnamese authorities to allow the couple to depart for Manila in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Ho Tranh Duc's father died fighting the Japanese, and his mother abandoned the 
infant to remarry. Duc became a domestic servant. 
</P>
<P>
"They more or less sold me from one family to another," he said. "One time 
somebody bought me and used makeup to make me very ugly, and took me out 
begging." 
</P>
<P>
An aunt rescued him from the street when he was 11. By his late teens, he was 
already fascinated by collage. The French artist George Braque inflamed him, 
but there were also practical concerns. "I didn't have any money to buy paint," 
he said. Instead, he tore paper from " 'Paris Match,' 'Life' magazine, whatever 
had color in it -- even cigarette packs." 
</P>
<P>
The faces of Christ and Buddha and the drab colors of war figure prominently in 
Duc's art. One series of collages that brought him early fame was made of torn 
fragments of robes given him by Buddhist monks. One robe was said to have 
belonged to a monk who immolated himself in protest. 
</P>
<P>
The celebrated couple declined offers to leave South Vietnam before the 1975 
communist victory. By 1977, however, they had changed their minds. "We had no 
freedom to choose our subjects, and we could not produce art under the 
censorship of the government," Duc said. 
</P>
<P>
A botched attempt to flee by boat brought Duc a two-year prison sentence. They 
waited a decade for permission to leave. In 1989, the couple revived their 
careers with two joint exhibitions in the Philippines, where Be Ky presented 
President Corazon Aquino with a Madonna sketch. 
</P>
<P>
They have settled in Garden Grove, where they have converted their suburban 
patio to a studio. At 50, Duc is learning to drive. Be Ky is adjusting to a 
hearing aide. Her husband jokes that for the first time in their married life 
he can whisper in her ear -- and they can keep secrets from their four 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Khai tried to paint peace. On Vietnamese lacquer he created abstract 
tableaux of doves, mandolins and women with fluid limbs and hair. He helped 
found a union of young artists, did not shun fame, and managed to dodge the 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, a North Vietnamese official came to visit his studio, and explained 
that abstract painting would not be welcomed by the new regime. Khai attended 
re-education lectures, where it was suggested that he abandon bourgeois 
romanticism and tackle subjects from everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
The new government bought three of Khai's older paintings and hung them in the 
national gallery in Hanoi. But they were displeased by his new oil of a woman 
in a torn blouse. It was intended to depict poverty and misery, Khai said, but 
there wasn't supposed to be misery in the new Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"They wanted me to draw realistic life in Vietnam, but once I did it, they 
didn't like it because it was too realistic," Khai said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
He was sent to paint scenes of workers in factories, with the results to be 
shown to the political officer in charge. In one painting, Khai showed a 
laborer but failed to detail all of the machinery in the background. 
</P>
<P>
"They said, 'Don't leave anything out. . . . They wanted to show that they had 
a lot of technology," he said. He used his travel pass to scout for ways to 
leave the country, and fled by boat with his wife and two children in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Since coming to the West, his colors have gotten brighter. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my paintings have more movement," Khai said. "And movement expresses 
freedom." 
</P>
<P>
The 50-year old artist is virtually unknown here, and commercial success has 
eluded him. Refugee status has compounded the panoply of artists' usual 
problems. But his work has been shown at UC Irvine and UCLA, and several small 
Orange County galleries, and a new show will open Aug. 3 in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
Khai's larger paintings are done on lacquer, with eggshells that must be 
carefully applied, then sanded down, and topped with gold and silver leaf. 
</P>
<P>
"I recently sold that painting to a Caucasian woman for $3,000," Khai said, 
pointing to a large ocher and gold abstract. "But it took me two months." 
</P>
<P>
"It is so hard for these people. A lot of them say they want to give up," said 
gallery owner Nguyen Viet. "I keep telling them not to give up." 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Thi Hop and Nguyen Dong were trained in fine technique at the National 
Academy of Art in Saigon, but their most vibrant work was done with children's 
crayons. 
</P>
<P>
The couple fled Vietnam on an overcrowded boat in 1979, survived a parched 
journey and robbery by Thai pirates, and wound up in the Pulau Bidong refugee 
camp in Malaysia. Finally, a friend gave them a roll of blueprint paper and a 
box of wax crayons. 
</P>
<P>
They had each been influenced by Henri Rousseau; now the naif style seemed to 
match for their crude materials and their primitive surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
The colorful simplicity of their drawings does not disguise the hardships of 
camp life. Dong drew a vista of a denuded hillside where he had cut and carried 
logs to build them a crude cabin. Hop drew women gathering at the central well 
and hauling water back to their shacks. 
</P>
<P>
A Canadian saw their work. "He asked us if we would sell these drawings in 
Canada, to raise money to help people in the camps," Dong said. "But even 
though we had no money, nothing, we didn't want to sell. They are souvenirs." 
</P>
<P>
Now they work as graphic artists for a Vietnamese-language newspaper, and 
illustrate books in their spare time. Gay colors and rounded figures give their 
work an unfettered charm. 
</P>
<P>
Hop, 46, draws placid scenes of robust country women washing or eating fruit, 
of children playing in temple gardens or screened verandas. Light radiates from 
their skin as from Venetian saints. Dong, 49, paints idyllic scenes of water 
buffalo, banana trees and fish ponds. 
</P>
<P>
They paint a Vietnam that existed perhaps a century ago, or perhaps never 
existed at all: a world too gentle for war, a land unscathed by napalm or 
defoliant. 
</P>
<P>
"We get the beautiful image of what our country was like before the war, from 
our parents or our grandparents," Dong said. "Not from our own experience."

TRICKLE'S FIELD DAY LEADS HOCKEY EFFORT

Goals were the goal for Taylor Trickle and on Sunday, the 18-year-old from 
Camarillo delivered. 
</P>
<P>
He scored three -- none of which trickled in -- helping the South field hockey 
team blank the North, 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
Trickle's hat trick was the first such outburst in two days of play at Augsburg 
College, site of play in the U. S. Olympic Festival. 
</P>
<P>
"I came into the Festival with the goal to score goals," Trickle said, "but I 
never expected to score three in one game." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Holtz, 29, of Simi Valley, scored the first two goals for the South (2-0). 
South goalkeeper Tom Vano, also of Simi Valley, made nine saves. 
</P>
<P>
In figure skating, strong long programs enabled Tish Walker, 16, of Thousand 
Oaks, to move up from fifth in singles and the duo of Tristen Vega of Torrance 
and Richard Alexander of Simi Valley to do the same in pairs. 
</P>
<P>
Which in the end made it all the more frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
Walker finished fourth, the same as Vega and Alexander -- one place short of a 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
Walker stirred a capacity crowd of more than 13,000 with an exhilarating 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, that was of some consolation. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hoping to get a medal and just missed, but I'm still pleased with my 
performance and how I skated," Walker said. "The crowd was great. They really 
gave me inspiration and motivation out there." 
</P>
<P>
Ditto for Vega and Alexander, who moved into medal contention with a strong 
finishing routine. 
</P>
<P>
The ladies' singles event was won by Nancy Kerrigan of Stoneham, Mass. Angela 
Deneweth of Westland, Mich., and John Denton of Morro Bay took the gold medal 
in pairs. 
</P>
<P>
In swimming, Kristine Quance made her festival debut with a performance that 
she won't soon forget. 
</P>
<P>
Neither, probably, will those who pursued her in the race at the University of 
Minnesota Aquatics Center. 
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old from Northridge won a gold medal in the women's 400-meter 
individual medley, defeating second-place Natasha Kohne of Stanton, Calif., by 
well over two seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Quance won with a time of 4 minutes 56.77 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Kohne finished in 4:59.46 and Kelly Leaman of Centerville, Ohio, was third in 
5:02.48. 
</P>
<P>
In canoeing, Dave and Fred Spaulding, brothers from Ventura, have proven to be 
double trouble on the water at Lake Elmo. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the Spauldings won their second goal medal as a doubles team in what 
ended up a two-canoe race. 
</P>
<P>
Spaulding and Spaulding nipped Jim Terrell of El Toro and Wyatt Jones of 
Honolulu, 1:54.65 to 1:54.97, in the 500-meter doubles race. 
</P>
<P>
They had defeated the same pair on Saturday in the 1,000-meter race. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Harper of Ventura and Stewart Carr of Indianapolis led the second pack home 
in the 500 and earned the bronze with a time of 2:03.21. 
</P>
<P>
Harper also placed sixth in the 500-meter singles race with a time of 2:20.52. 
Terrell won the event in 2:06.24. 
</P>
<P>
In tennis, Natasha Pospich of Woodland Hills advanced to today's second round 
of women's singles play with a 6-0, 3-6, 6-4, victory over Jennifer Poulos of 
Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Pospich and mixed doubles teammate Chris Pressley of Miami didn't fare as well. 
They dropped a 6-4, 6-2, first-round decision to Keirsten Alley of Melrose, 
Mass., and Jason Marler of Enid, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
In men's basketball, Lucious Harris' shooting slump continued. 
</P>
<P>
However, he managed to reach double figures in scoring for the second 
consecutive day, helping the West to a 117-96 victory over the East. 
</P>
<P>
Harris, who played at Cleveland High, made only four of 12 field-goal attempts 
and was two of four from the free-throw line, finishing with 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
Dedan Thomas, who played at Antelope Valley College last season, experienced 
similar difficulties, making two of six shots and finishing with four points. 
</P>
<P>
Shon Tarver, from Santa Clara High, only wished he would have been around to 
take a shot. 
</P>
<P>
Tarver landed heavily on his back after going for a rebound only four minutes 
into the game. 
</P>
<P>
He sustained a deep bruise, but X-rays showed no fracture and he attended 
therapy sessions later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
Tarver, who had 18 points in the West's first game, is listed as questionable 
for today's game against the North. 
</P>
<P>
In cycling, Katie Beck placed fifth in the women's 50-kilometer road race with 
a time of 1:23.26. Amy Gibson of Boise, Idaho, won the event with a time of 
1:22.29.

VALENZUELA TOILS ON IN SERENE OBSCURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM CALLAHAN, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of those no-hitters that punctuated June went by too quickly. It followed 
in the backwash of Dave Stewart and soon was trumped by Andy Hawkins. In 
newspaper terms, Friday night on the West Coast is the ideal time to do 
anything and escape notice. Baseball needed a longer moment to pause and 
consider Fernando Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
The last couple of decades have been grand for pitchers. Jim Palmer is expected 
momentarily at the Hall of Fame. Tom Seaver waits on deck. Other recent 
retirees -- Fergie Jenkins, Steve Carlton, Gaylord Perry -- crowd the waiting 
room. Nolan Ryan, their contemporary, carries on. Dwight Gooden, Roger Clemens 
and the rest of a fine new batch promise to go as far. 
</P>
<P>
But just in case he doesn't get much further, think of what Valenzuela has 
done. It sounds sad and strange to put it that way. After all, according to his 
birth certificate, Valenzuela will not reach 30 until November. But he was an 
old 15 in Navojoa, Sonora, Mexico. Major league scouts, not the most polite 
body of men, counted the rings of wrinkles around his neck. "I know one thing 
for sure," reported San Francisco bird-dog Grady Hatton. "He's got a chance to 
be a member of the all-ugly club." 
</P>
<P>
Hatton was wrong about that. Valenzuela has a face like a jack-o'-lantern's and 
a body that tends naturally to abundance. But he is a handsome man, possibly 
the most handsome man in the league. Dodgers Manager Tommy Lasorda was the 
first to see it in 1981. "People tell me that Fernando is portly," he said. 
"They also tell me he has a couple of gaps between his teeth. But I look at him 
and I can't decide whether he reminds me of Rock Hudson or Robert Redford." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda was not talking only about the pitcher, whose first few years were 
dazzling. Like most managers, but especially those who failed as players and 
were acquainted with the winter leagues, Lasorda speaks a pidgin Spanish 
(roughly the equal of his English) and understands the hardship Valenzuela knew 
breaking into the big leagues that Bret Saberhagen did not. 
</P>
<P>
"The only words with which I'm able to communicate with him," catcher Mike 
Scioscia said at first, "are beer, light beer and tacos. So when he gets into 
trouble in a game, I call time and walk to the mound for a conference. I say to 
him, 'Beer, light beer and tacos.' He nods. I then call for a screwball, he 
strikes the man out and we win the game." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela picked up the screwball from reliever Bobby Castillo and coach Ron 
Perranoski in two weeks. By his own calculation, Carl Hubbell took six years to 
learn it. After throwing a scroogie for 16 seasons, Hubbell's left arm hung 
palm-out at rest. 
</P>
<P>
Starting thunderously -- not just winning games but finishing them -- 
Valenzuela was the NL rookie of the year and Cy Young Award winner of 1981. 
Because it was an abbreviated strike season, his 13-7 record may not look like 
much in years to come. His entire resume'may be underwhelming. Only once has he 
won 20 games. That's the trouble with this rotisserie age, with painting 
portraits entirely by the numbers. History can miss the full picture, the whole 
man. 
</P>
<P>
From opening day of 1981 through August 1988, when his shoulder temporarily 
gave out, Valenzuela went 255 games without missing a start. He was good for 
250 to 300 innings a year, striking out 200 to 250 batters along the way. He 
never skipped a turn. He never complained. 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati coach Tony Perez, a proud Cuban, believes there are two kinds of 
Latin ballplayers: those who fit the various stereotypes, and those who hate 
the stereotyping so much that they tend to confront anyone in the clubhouse who 
would contribute to it. Valenzuela is a third type, who, atop the mound and 
away from it, has demonstrated a serene character, dignity and decency. Whether 
earning the minimum wage or $2 million a year, he has managed to keep faith 
with two communities, avoiding the sexual and pharmaceutical clouds that 
commonly attend roller-coaster celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
With fireworks, he brought the neighborhood of Chavez Ravine into Dodger 
Stadium. Then, after the comet passed, the workman settled in for the longer 
haul, and in his honest way the last couple of years he has been just as 
dazzling. After the no-hitter, Valenzuela immediately resumed being 
relentlessly unspectacular, happily handing back the spotlight to Dominican 
strikeout artist Ramon Martinez. "Now that I can really speak English," 
Valenzuela said mock-forlornly, "nobody wants to talk to me anymore." 
</P>
<P>
No matter what Scioscia thought, Valenzuela always understood more than he let 
on. Away from his teammates, he seldom ordered beer, light beer and tacos. He 
would run his finger down promising menus and stop instinctively at adventurous 
spots. "I was often surprised," he said, "but I was never disappointed."

CLARK, TIGERS ARE SET TO SIGN BIG CONTRACT 
</P>

<P>
After a month of negotiations, the Detroit Tigers appear ready to make Tony 
Clark the richest high school draft pick ever, Clark's father, Arthur Clark 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, who was drafted second in the nation out of Christian High School in the 
June free agent draft, is expected to sign by Wednesday or Thursday and report 
to the Tigers' Rookie League team in Bristol, Va. by July 16. Last season, 
Clark batted .524 and hit 11 home runs in just 44 official at bats. 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers have compared Clark, a 6-foot-8 outfielder, to the Mets' Darryl 
Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, Clark, who has already signed a basketball letter of intent with the 
University of Arizona, is playing for the West squad at the U.S. Olympic 
Festival in Minneapolis. Clark, who was unavailable for comment, scored nine 
points in the West's 134-120 loss to the South. 
</P>
<P>
"There's just a couple of minor parts to be worked out, but we've agreed on the 
money," Arthur Clark said. "That was a stumbling block. We're ready to sign." 
</P>
<P>
Although Tiger officials were unavailable for comment, they are believed to be 
offering Clark a signing bonus of between $400,000 and $500,000. The No. 1 
pick, Chipper Jones, signed with the Atlanta Braves for a reported $275,000, 
but he did not have the leverage Clark did. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm excited for Tony," Arthur Clark said. "This is probably the best contract 
any kid out of high school has ever received." 
</P>
<P>
The Tigers and the Clark family have worked out a deal that would give Clark 
the right to leave Bristol for college on Aug. 16, a week before school begins 
in Tucson -- meaning Clark would only play for about four weeks this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Next year, Clark, the state's leading scorer in basketball at 43.1 points per 
game last season, should be able to play a full summer season. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Tony will be in Bristol next season," Arthur Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
Lute Olson, Arizona's basketball coach, said he expects Clark to compete for a 
starting job this fall along with Chris Mills, a transfer from Kentucky.

TREAR CAN'T BEAT ODDS, FALLS TO BUJON AT LA JOLLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
The odds were not in Anthony Trear's favor. He was 11 years older than his 
opponent, Tony Bujon, and he hadn't played a tournament in 2 1/2 years. 
Meanwhile, Bujon, 20, was in the prime of his tennis career and coming off a 
round of 16 performance at the NCAA's in his hometown of Palm Desert. 
</P>
<P>
For a short while, it looked like Trear, a resident of San Diego, might buck 
those odds as he led 4-1 in the first set. But reality and a thing called 
physical conditioning became a factor late in the first set and before long 
Bujon had swept away Trear, 7-5, 6-2, to win the men's open finals Sunday at 
the 74th La Jolla Tennis Tournament at the La Jolla Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's open finals, University of San Diego's Tonya Fuller broke San 
Diego State's Dorey Brandt's serve four consecutive times in the second set and 
went on to win, 6-4, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
Trear, who played college tennis at UCLA, began the match by winning 12 points 
in a row off his serve and by breaking in the fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
"He started out playing well," said Bujon, a junior at Texas Christian 
University. "I'm supposed to win these matches since I'm still in college. I 
was a little tight." 
</P>
<P>
But Bujon loosened up by holding his serve and then breaking Trear's serve to 
make it 4-3. Trear had a game point, but he netted a forehand approach shot. 
</P>
<P>
"The match seemed to turn after that," Trear said. 
</P>
<P>
It did. Trear was subsequently broken on five of the next six service games to 
fall behind 4-1 in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
Trear said he began to feel the effects of his inactivity after the first set. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't physically up," Trear said. 'All the matches just caught up to me. 
That, combined with him hitting awesome shots." 
</P>
<P>
Bujon's passing shots and volleys were just too much for Trear to handle. And 
when Bujon wasn't at the net, he was chasing down Trear's volleys for running 
forehand winners. 
</P>
<P>
"I just started getting confident and swinging through the ball," said Bujon, 
who was coming off a month layoff due to surgery on his ingrown toenails. 
</P>
<P>
Fuller trailed in both sets, 4-3 in the first and 3-0 in the second. But each 
time she came back by attacking Brandt's forehand. 
</P>
<P>
"Any smart person's going to play my forehand," said Brandt, who was seeded 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Fuller, seeded fifth, kept the ball in play and forced Brandt to make all the 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
"That's my game," said Fuller, who has now beaten Brandt three consecutive 
times. "Keeping the ball in play is what won this tournament for me." 
</P>
<P>
It's likely Brandt will have another shot at Fuller. Both will be seniors next 
year.

MAZE, LABELLE BARELY STEAL SHOW FROM THE CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The marathon R&amp;B extravaganza at the Rose Bowl, which stretched from the 
heat of the late afternoon into the chill of the night Saturday, was a 
disappointment -- unless you're partial to brawls and muddy sound. 
</P>
<P>
The 11th annual Budweiser Superfest, a touring concert package sponsored by the 
beer company, was marred by several fistfights -- prompting some security 
guards to blame the behavior on drunkenness and to complain about the sale of 
beer at such day-long, summer events. 
</P>
<P>
At times, the slugfests got a bigger response from the estimated 40,000 people 
on hand than some of the day's many artists. 
</P>
<P>
Billed as something for everyone, the Pasadena show featured ballads (Regina 
Belle and Patti LaBelle), rap (Big Daddy Kane), funk (the Gap Band), 
up-to-the-minute, youth-oriented R&amp;B (Bell Biv DeVoe plus Tony Toni Tone 
and After 7) and the R&amp;B grooves of Maze featuring Frankie Beverly. 
</P>
<P>
As with most stadium shows, the sound was mostly awful, with the pounding of 
the rhythm section frequently drowning out the vocals. 
</P>
<P>
By far the best performer on the bill was Maze, a veteran band skilled in the 
art of playing stadiums. Maze's style is to set a loping R&amp;B groove and 
lure the audience into it. The vocals on a song such as "Joy and Pain" aren't 
as important as Maze's grooves, which swept through the stadium like wildfire, 
setting toes tapping and hands clapping. It's the kind of music that 
transcended the sound problems. 
</P>
<P>
As usual with these multi-act stadium shows, the audience took its time getting 
involved in what was happening on stage. It's as if the crowd, knowing they are 
in for a long haul, conserve their energy during the opening acts. 
</P>
<P>
But the audience woke up in a hurry when Patti LaBelle -- affectionately known 
as Mighty Mouth -- went into action around 6. Her melodramatic, no-holds-barred 
gospel style is made to order for a stadium. Certainly, fans in the last row 
had no trouble relating to fiery LaBelle, who can project as well as anyone in 
pop. 
</P>
<P>
LaBelle doesn't sing a song -- she fractures it. She'll take a number such as 
"Over the Rainbow," discard the melody and use the song's bare bones as a base 
from which to plunge into her histrionics. She invariably stumbles into such 
excess that you wish that she'd tone down the melodrama, but there are always 
moments of vocal brilliance -- moments you marvel at because you know so few 
singers are capable of such feats. But all that melodrama is tiring. At a 
certain point you can hardly wait for her set to end. 
</P>
<P>
Bell Biv DeVoe's set was only about 20 minutes -- and still seemed too long. 
The group's recent album, "Poison," is a studio triumph, but the trio -- 
despite years of touring with New Edition -- still has a lot to learn as 
performers. Before jumping into the stadium circuit, they should be working 
clubs and small theaters, developing a stage persona and confidence. 
</P>
<P>
Near the end of the show, rapper Big Daddy Kane did about 20 minutes of 
unconvincing boasting, backed by dancers who struggled through some crudely 
choreographed numbers. Despite rap's popularity these days, Kane wasn't able to 
establish any significant contact with the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The Gap Band, with its flimsy funk, closed the show. This once-classy group has 
degenerated to the point where it's merely above a lounge act. In the old days, 
the Gap Band played a brand of urgent, robust funk that was almost 
irresistible. But somewhere along the line, the group's funk lost its crackle 
and pop. 
</P>
<P>
The Gap Band was shouting at the audience to get up and dance but more people 
were getting up and leaving.

RECORD GROUPS ISSUE WARNINGS OF THEIR OWN; 
</P>
<P>
LEGISLATION: IF LOUISIANA'S GOVERNOR SIGNS A BILL REQUIRING LABELS ON 
'OFFENSIVE' RECORDINGS, RECORD-INDUSTRY GROUPS PROMISE LEGAL AND ECONOMIC 
RETALIATION. 
</P>

<P>
The record industry has vowed swift legal and economic retaliation if a pending 
Louisiana bill becomes law requiring allegedly "offensive" recordings to carry 
government-mandated warning labels. The bill, which passed the Louisiana Senate 
on Friday and was approved by the House of Representatives on Saturday, is 
expected to reach Gov. Charles Roemer's desk today. 
</P>
<P>
Roemer was unavailable for comment, but Billy Riemes, his deputy chief of 
staff, said that the governor may veto the bill "as it is presently structured" 
but that he could not offer any further details. 
</P>
<P>
Jay Berman, president of the Recording Industry Assn. of America, the 
organization that represents most of the country's major record labels, 
promised a court battle if the governor signs the bill. Berman's group has 
helped defeat more than a dozen similar label proposals in other states. 
</P>
<P>
"This law tramples on the right to freedom of expression guaranteed to all 
Americans under the Constitution," Berman said in a statement. "It is tragic 
that Louisiana legislators are willing to turn their backs on the basic 
freedoms that make our country what it is today." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, 
said that the academy will cancel consideration of New Orleans as a site for 
the Grammy Hall of Fame if the governor signs the bill. "The passage of this 
bill is an indication as to the climate of cultural artistic intolerance in 
Louisiana," Greene said. "We will not be a part of that." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the National Assn. of Recording Merchandisers said the 
organization intends to scratch plans for its 1992 convention in New Orleans if 
the law is enacted. 
</P>
<P>
Targeted in the legislation are lyrics that advocate or encourage sex, 
substance abuse, violence and other subjects "potentially harmful to minors." 
Under the law, which would go into effect Jan. 1, 1992, retailers, distributors 
and manufacturers who sell a labeled album to an "unmarried person under the 
age of 17" could be fined up to $1,000 and jailed up to six months. The sale of 
unlabeled recordings to minors could bring fines up to $5,000 for producers as 
well as manufacturers and distributors.

LAMB'S THEATRE EFFORT BETTER THAN THE SCRIPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NATIONAL CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mr. Toad is obsessed with cars. He likes to drive 'em and crash 'em. Not even 
the fatherly Mr. Badger or Toad's buddies Ratty and Mole can do anything to 
stop him. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Toad is a child's vision of what a frog should be -- stubborn, charming and 
self-involved. And therein lies his appeal, as immortalized in the Kenneth 
Grahame classic, "The Wind in the Willows." 
</P>
<P>
Cute. Very cute. But cute can be deadly, if not handled with expert care. An 
A.A. Milne adaptation of this work garnered raves in Los Angeles several years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
But, sadly, Douglas Post's musical adaptation, playing here at Lamb's Players 
Theatre through July 29, isn't likely to win raves from anyone. 
</P>
<P>
Unless it's for the talent of the Lamb's Players team, which comes closer than 
one could imagine to rising over the warts inherent in the script. With lesser 
talent, this production could have been one giant croak. 
</P>
<P>
It's a feat all the more remarkable for those familiar with the troubled 
genesis of this production. Lamb's had been set to open "The Lion, the Witch 
and the Wardrobe" -- much meatier fare -- two weeks ago, when they discovered, 
days before opening night, that the Southern California rights to C.S. Lewis' 
works had been obtained by somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
The company gave itself two weeks to find an alternative suitable for its 
woodsy, fantasy-world set, obtain the rights to the script and then do the rest 
-- cast, costume, choreograph and open. 
</P>
<P>
Under the skillful direction of Robert Smyth, the Lamb's artistic director, the 
company dazzles from moment to moment even as the script, which meanders 
mercilessly in the beginning, stops from time to time for songs, which, while 
beautifully sung and orchestrated, are more than a tad silly. 
</P>
<P>
As much as Lamb's meets the material head-on, the company does look a trifle 
sheepish forging through lyrics like, "The Toad is back, the Toad is back, the 
Toad is back." 
</P>
<P>
The cast itself, however, is close to irreproachable. The mellifluous musical 
accompaniment by music director Todd Neal brings out the best in a fine 
ensemble of voices and often makes you forget the preciousness of the songs. 
</P>
<P>
David Cochran Heath, his dark hair dyed blond, is an irresistible Toad, upper 
class and childishly full of himself and his obsessions. Leigh Scarritt is a 
memorable Mole, tiny and curved inwards like a frightened little animal, but 
with remarkable dexterity -- she does a mean cartwheel -- and a sweet voice. 
Deborah Gilmour Smyth provides strong support as the Rat, but without 
establishing a clear personality for Ratty other than an Irish brogue. Luther 
Hanson is spunky as Otter, Paul Devine weaselly as Weasel, Howard Bickle 
doleful as William the Horse and Cynthia Peters equally charming as a Field 
Mouse and jailer's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Turner's choreography keeps the songs moving, which helps diffuse much 
of the score's essential inanity. The racing in place that accompanies the 
first bumpy carriage ride Mr. Toad gives to Mole and Ratty, makes a static 
vehicle come alive with breathless movement. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Turner's stone-like set, dappled by Mike Buckley's delicate lighting, 
admirably fits the fairy-tale forest theme. Jeanne Reith's Dickensian costumes 
give the show a level of dignity that might have been compromised if the 
company had tried to replicate animals by using animal costumes. 
</P>
<P>
In this production of "The Wind in the Willows," Lamb's shows that it has a 
talent for children's theater, one of San Diego County's sadly neglected forms; 
the company invests itself in the material, without being condescending. If 
they were handicapped here by a less than ideal script, they do everything they 
can to compensate. The results, while often charming, are ultimately a 
testament to the importance of the written word as the starting place of all 
good theater. 
</P>
<P>
Still, children's theater is something one hopes the company will try again. 
</P>
<P>
This show is not recommended for children of all ages; because of a gunshot and 
a few car crashes, children of five or six who tend to have difficulty 
distinguishing reality from fantasy, may be frightened. But children 7 or over 
may very well enjoy it and ask parents to buy the book which is on sale at the 
theater during intermission -- along with copies of "The Lion, the Witch and 
the Wardrobe," which, sadly, did not make it to the Lamb's stage this time 
around. 
</P>
<P>

THE MICHELANGELO OF SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For more than 25 years Joseph Chapman has made his living, in part, by breaking 
into museums. 
</P>
<P>
"I walked through the museum like I was a visitor and then at the end of the 
day I went into a men's room stall and hid there," said Chapman, 60, a ruggedly 
built man who speaks about art with reverence. The story he was telling took 
place in 1965 at the Amon Carter Museum in Ft. Worth, Tex. "At 5 o'clock I 
heard the toggle switches go and everything got dark and quiet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"And the museum was all mine." 
</P>
<P>
Chapman was not there to take anything. Rather, he was intent on leaving 
something behind -- his business card. Chapman, a former FBI agent, is founder 
of one of the best known museum security companies in the world. He and his 
team of architects and engineers have designed security systems for the 
National Gallery of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the National Archives, the 
Forbidden Museum in Beijing, the Egyptian Museum of Antiquities in Cairo, the 
National Palace Museum in Taiwan, some of the Smithsonian museums and the 
Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Locally, he has done work for the the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the J. 
Paul Getty Museum, the Norton Simon Museum and the Gene Autry Museum, for which 
his team designed a high-tech system so pervasive that it makes use of cameras 
hidden inside the heads of manikins, microwave motion detectors hidden in the 
walls and tiny electronic sensors attached to every object on display. 
</P>
<P>
In the last week-and-a-half, the number of calls coming into his 
Connecticut-based firm has increased at least 50%, Chapman said. The reasons 
are easy to trace. On June 28, three Van Gogh paintings were stolen from the 
North Brabant Museum, 55 miles south of Amsterdam, and last Wednesday three 
paintings were taken from three museums in Paris, including a Renoir that was 
sliced from its frame in the Louvre. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been getting calls from museums I have never heard of," Chapman said, 
adding that they had a similar flurry of calls in March after the theft of $200 
million worth of paintings and drawings from the Isabella Stewart Gardner 
Museum in Boston. "There is nothing like a terrible robbery to call attention 
to the woeful security situation in some museums." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Chapman leaves today for the Netherlands -- officials of the North 
Brabant Museum are bringing him in to visit their institution and discuss what 
a new security system would entail. 
</P>
<P>
He has not been contacted by the Louvre. "French museum officials don't much 
like to call on outsiders," said Chapman, who has been a frequent visitor to 
that museum. Asked to hazard an assessment of the Louvre's security 
arrangements, he said he has noticed that the security guards are not 
aggressively diligent. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, at the Louvre the security guards are almost all, by 
requirement, disabled war veterans," Chapman said. "The problem is that they 
have not had a war recently from which to draw worthwhile people." 
</P>
<P>
Chapman began dealing with art thefts in 1958 when J. Edgar Hoover appointed 
him as the first FBI agent to exclusively investigate these types of crimes. He 
made several famous art recoveries while with the bureau, including Picassos 
stolen from a Pittsburgh industrialist (Chapman was made up to look like the 
industrialist to deal with a thief who demanded ransom) and a group of Paul 
Cezanne drawings stolen in France. 
</P>
<P>
In 1964, Chapman left the bureau to be a consultant to Lloyd's of London, the 
New York attorney general and an art heist movie entitled "How to Steal a 
Million." He set up his own security firm in New York, and one of the first 
calls came from an old friend, the director of the Carter Museum in Ft. Worth. 
"He told me, 'We have a good security system but I would like to have an 
outside evaluation. Why don't you drop in some time? You don't even have to 
tell me you are coming.' " 
</P>
<P>
Chapman, who believes in the element of surprise, left on a flight that same 
morning to Ft. Worth. Being careful not to be seen by the museum director, he 
toured the Carter and then hid. He was a "stay behind," in the jargon of the 
art-theft world. He wandered the museum halls unchallenged, placing his card 
behind several pictures. He also got into the director's office to leave 
another card and a note giving the telephone number of his hotel across the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
When he left through a door, he purposely tripped a photoelectric beam alarm 
and then went up to his room to observe the police response. 
</P>
<P>
"The director called me the next morning," he said. After muttering an epithet 
in greeting, the director demanded that Chapman "come over here and have 
lunch." Chapman eventually designed a new security system for the museum, one 
that has at least so far guarded it from "stay behinds" or any other kind of 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman has, however, suffered losses from museums with which he has worked. 
The worst came just before Christmas, 1978, when a call came from the Chicago 
Institute of Art, for which he had designed a security system. Three Cezanne 
paintings, worth more than $3 million, were missing. He caught a flight to 
Chicago, not to return home for several months. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman gives credit to the Chicago police for eventually solving the crime, 
which centered on "the most dangerous piece of paper in the museum environment, 
the temporary removal notice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone who frequents museums is familiar with those small notices that mark 
the spots where art has been removed for photography, a loan, repair or some 
other reason. The man who was eventually convicted of the crime, Laud Spencer 
Pace, worked as an art handler in the museum and figured out that if he took a 
painting off a wall and replaced it with an official-looking notice, the 
robbery would not be discovered for at least several days. This gave him ample 
time to take each painting out of its frame and wear it home under his winter 
coat. 
</P>
<P>
"When they arrested him," Chapman said, "they found over 2,000 blank notices in 
his apartment." 
</P>
<P>
Chapman now asks all his museums to keep careful control of the temporary 
notices, and he trains security personal to regularly read them. 
</P>
<P>
Another important safeguard against inside jobs, Chapman said, are thorough, 
centralized inventory records. At some major museums individual curators still 
keep their own records, which can lead to easy theft. If a stored object is 
taken and the record of it destroyed, it can be difficult to trace. 
</P>
<P>
Computerized inventories provide better security but can also be the source of 
unpleasant surprises. A computerized inventory check last year resulted in the 
discovery that more than 100 objects, worth more than $2 million, were missing 
from the collection of American Indian art at the Southwest Museum in Los 
Angeles. Officials at that museum still refuse to call it a theft, even though 
the FBI has been investigating and has reportedly recovered some of the objects 
from dealers and collectors far from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Southwest Museum would not discuss details of their security 
system but said it had been upgraded since the objects were discovered missing. 
</P>
<P>
At some museums, a thorough inventory is simply not practical. "In 1976, the 
word came down that we had to put a real emphasis on inventory and collections 
management," said Warren Danzenbaker, who at the time was in charge of security 
for the Museum of American History, one of the Smithsonian museums in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, we only had about 15 million objects to worry about," he said with 
a laugh, "of which about 12 million were stamps." 
</P>
<P>
Because the Smithsonian has periodic inventories, strict policies on the 
movement of art objects and a pervasive electronic security system, said 
Danzenbaker, who is now chief of security systems for all the Smithsonians, the 
museums have not suffered a serious loss due to theft since 1981 when someone 
made off with a set of George Washington's false teeth. 
</P>
<P>
The electronic wizardry of the modern security world is markedly out of place 
with the bucolic surroundings at Chapman's home and offices in suburban 
Connecticut. A cobblestone walk leads to the simple white house where Chapman 
and his artist wife, Else, live. There are gardens, stone walls, wind chimes 
and lawn benches. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby is a converted barn that looks homey from the outside, but inside are 
immaculate workplaces and offices for the 14 full-time employees of his 
company, a drafting room and a library. 
</P>
<P>
Also inside are stored the security plans for some of the world's most famous 
museums. 
</P>
<P>
Doesn't it make Chapman nervous to have those plans -- which are printed on the 
premises because Chapman doesn't trust them to outsiders -- out here in the 
country? He shakes his head no and points to various wooden boxes attached to 
the house and barn. 
</P>
<P>
"That one is a passive infrared energy type," he said, pointing to a box 
painted to fit the color scheme of the barn. "There is another one behind the 
rain gutter and another behind the wind chimes." 
</P>
<P>
All, he explained are connected to a master control in the house that is 
monitored 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
Not even his employees -- all of whom go through extensive background checks 
before being hired -- have access to complete plans. Several of them might work 
on a museum, but in the company only Chapman, his wife and Robert Ducibella, an 
engineer who recently became his partner, ever see a museum's complete security 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
The company is currently working on new projects being designed by prominent 
architects such as Robert Venturi, Frank Gehry and Peter Eisenman. They have 
several Southern California projects in the design stage, including at Hebrew 
Union College in Los Angeles and museums in Newport Beach, Santa Ana and La 
Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman and his crew are also under contract to periodically run a security 
check on museums for which they previously designed a system. This includes an 
occasional staged stay behind -- they enter the museum unannounced and try to 
find a place to hide. 
</P>
<P>
"We fit ourselves into a closet or some place where we might not be discovered, 
and then wait and see if the system works," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually," he said with a smile, "we get caught."

HIGH-TECH MUSEUM SAFEGUARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Electronics has revolutionized museum security in the last two decades. 
According to Warren Danzenbaker, chief of security systems for the Smithsonian 
museums, a variety of high-tech detectors are now used to monitor storage areas 
and, when the museum is not open to the public, display rooms. 
</P>
<P>
* Passive Infrared Sensors: Known in the industry as PIRs, these small sensors 
detect the body heat of humans. If a person walks into a room covered by 
activated PIRs, a signal should go out. 
</P>
<P>
* Ultrasonic Sensors: These fill a room with inaudible, ultrasonic frequency 
sound patterns. If the patterns are disturbed by movement, an alarm is 
triggered. 
</P>
<P>
* Microwave Sensors: Because microwaves travel through walls, these detectors 
can be hidden out of sight. They aim a microwave field into a space to detect 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
Also in use are vibration, glass break and pressure sensors and magnetic 
contact switches that set off an alarm if a door or display case is opened. 
</P>
<P>
Because a tiny wireless transmitter is affixed to every object on display at 
the Gene Autry museum, an alarm can be instantly localized, according to the 
designer of its security system, Joseph Chapman. If an object is disturbed and 
the alarm tripped, a digital read-out in the control room identifies the object 
and its location. 
</P>
<P>
Security consultant Steven Keller, who designed the system for the Armand 
Hammer Museum now under construction in Westwood, said he is experimenting with 
a system that can trace the movement, on a screen, of any object as it is 
transported around a museum. He got the idea from an article he read about 
electronic chips embeded in the wrist bands of Alzheimer's patients. The 
electronics enabled the staff of a residence home to keep track of the 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
Another of the newer security tools is video motion detection, which is 
especially appropriate to museums such as the Gene Autry where more than 80 
cameras are in use. The cameras designated for motion detection are trained on 
specific objects, be they paintings, sculptures, or display cases. Back in the 
control room, the outlines of these objects are traced with an electronic 
pencil on the video screens. 
</P>
<P>
A guard in the control room, which has enough high-tech equipment to resemble a 
small NASA outpost, doesn't have to keep constant watch on the screen. If any 
of the outlined objects is moved from its electronic boundary, the screen gives 
out audible and visible alarms. 
</P>
<P>
Another camera used by both Chapman and Keller comes hidden inside what appears 
to be an ordinary fire sprinkler. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman said his company generally charges, as a fee, between 1% and 2% of the 
architect's fee. Additionally, he said, equipment costs will be $2-$4 a foot, 
depending on the system. 
</P>
<P>
The fees and equipment costs can total between about $300,000 and several 
million dollars, Keller said, according to the size of a museum and the 
sophistication of its system. DAVID COLKER

THREE'S COMPANY LO-TECH DANCE SERIES IS OFF TO A FAST-PACED START 
</P>

<P>
Three's Company launched its Lo-Tec Series with three drop-dead dances by an 
innovative pair of modernists to anchor the program. Add to that, the striking 
presence of the most arresting performers seen on this summer dance series in 
recent memory, and you have an opening concert that will be a hard act to 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
Lar Lubovitch principal Nancy Colahan was the featured attraction, and she 
stole the show with two stunning solos from modern dance pioneer Jane Dudley's 
retrospective concert. 
</P>
<P>
Dudley (one-time Martha Graham soloist) is one of the unsung heroes of modern 
dance. Fortunately, Colahan's beautifully-realized re-creations of "Harmonica 
Breakdown," the choreographer's brilliant signature piece, and "Cante 
Flamenco," a fiery, flamenco-inspired work dedicated to the great Spanish 
dancer La Passionara, gave San Diego dance buffs an opportunity to see some of 
the groundbreaking work Dudley did back in the 1930s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
Colahan was electrifying in the highly-theatrical dances, despite the low level 
of technical support available at the Hillcrest studio. And her splendid 
costumes (authentically reproduced from Dudley's marvelous originals) enhanced 
the effect. 
</P>
<P>
The choppy robotics and angular leg lifts of "Harmonica Breakdown" contrasted 
sharply with the flamboyant port de bras and defiant backbends of Dudley's 
flamenco-style dance. Seen together, they left little doubt about Dudley's 
capacity for invention or her keen choreographic eye. 
</P>
<P>
Although Colahan has danced in San Diego before (as a member of the acclaimed 
Lubovitch troupe), it took this lo-tec appearance to highlight her powerful 
stage magic. Let's hope Three's Company gets her back for an encore next year. 
</P>
<P>
The Lo-Tec concerts also showcased a contemporary classic, "Three Tangos," 
choreographed in 1985 by the late Jack Moore. This staging, danced by a trio of 
Three's Company summer interns, was set by New York-based dancer Lance 
Westergard. 
</P>
<P>
The inventive triptych of solos was cleverly juxtaposed against a musical 
pastiche that underscored "Tango's" parody with refreshing wit. Nicely danced 
by the well-drilled performers, it got the concert off to a running start 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Colahan's husband, Lonne Moretton, was on hand for the kick-off concert -- but 
only as choreographer. 
</P>
<P>
Moretton created "In Flight" especially for the five local dancers. And they 
executed the ebullient airborne moves with admirable assurance, their student 
status notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the interns were invited to dance their own designs. Vicki Tolleson 
(one-time Merce Cunningham dancer) performed "Some Rhythm, No Reason," which 
more or less lived up to its name. Gail Olsen came up with "Breeze," a vigorous 
solo that kept her jumping along the lines of a jazzy score. 
</P>
<P>
Long-limbed Tonnie Haig snared the spotlight in Westergard's "Leaves of 
Hypnos," an evocative dance that took its cues from the piano plucks of a score 
by David Koblitz, and showed how far she has come in a short while. 
</P>
<P>
The Lo-Tec series will continue to occupy Three's Company's Hillcrest studio at 
8:30 Saturday and Sunday nights through mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
If the rest of the series comes close to upholding last weekend's standards, it 
will provide quite a summer bounty for local aficionados.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: THE DOG DAYS AND NIGHTS OF SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The mongrels of Monday. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, in pairing snubbed series pilots "Poochinski" and "Turner and Hooch," 
calls this a "Two Dog Night." But actually it's a three-dog night if you 
include the new CBS summer series "Prime Time Pets." 
</P>
<P>
And a four-dog July so far, if you throw in last week's airing of "The Jackie 
Bison Show" on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Suffice to say that "Prime Time Pets" (debuting at 8:30 tonight on Channels 2 
and 8, before returning later this week in its regular 8 p.m. Friday time slot) 
is a generally harmless, if inanely scripted alter ego of some of the more 
benign animal footage on ABC's "America's Funniest Home Videos." An even 
earlier ABC ancestor is "Those Amazing Animals" from 1980-81. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, tonight it's the pool-shooting dog, the gas pump-guarding goose, the 
dog-riding ducks, the soap opera-watching cockers, the kitten-nursing Doberman, 
the Labrador retriever that tends a physically impaired boy and so on and so 
on. Name your performing animal and you get it during this half hour, hosted by 
Wil Shriner. 
</P>
<P>
But what is this? Here comes the show's bubbly roving reporter Dorothy Lucey -- 
whose last major roving assignment for her regular employer, KCBS-TV Channel 2, 
was her memorable sweeps series on sleaze -- informing us that "Dean and Bobbie 
don't mind keeping their cats in the home." Are we talking about some beautiful 
human beings or what? 
</P>
<P>
And here are these great naturalists Dean and Bobbie with their cats -- an 
adult lion and an adult tiger, caged off together in the living room. And isn't 
that a cute little tiger cub romping on the rug? Living-room zoos are such fun. 
</P>
<P>
Just how is it that these magnificent animals came to be squeezed together in a 
small space inside a private home? Isn't there a law against this? Don't bother 
me, boy, it's time to move on to the Ping-Pong-playing house cat. 
</P>
<P>
And listen, if your hamster tap-dances, send in the video. 
</P>
<P>
"The Jackie Bison Show," a pilot that didn't get picked up, was an animated 
spoof of show business through the eyes of a talk-show host who just happened 
to be a bison. Aren't they all? 
</P>
<P>
His announcer was Larry J. Lizard, his girlfriend Jill St. Fawn, his humor 
mostly of the cheap play-on-names variety, eclipsing the few genuinely funny 
moments in a format paying homage to "The Jack Benny Show." 
</P>
<P>
Jackie (the voice of Stan Freberg) was billed as "America's beast of 
buffoonery." One of several on NBC, as it turns out. 
</P>
<P>
NBC could provide neither "Turner and Hooch" nor "Poochinski" in time for 
review. The former (8 p.m. on Channels 4, 36 and 39) spins off from the Tom 
Hanks theatrical movie of the same name. Turner is a fastidious cop, Hooch a 
big old messy dog. Turner and Hooch work together. 
</P>
<P>
In "Poochinski" (8:30 p.m.), a straight-arrow cop named McKay is jolted when 
his late partner, that slob Poochinski, returns in the body of a talking 
English bulldog seeking to find the man who murdered his human self. McKay and 
Poochinski work together. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, NBC could merge these two shows into a single spectacular titled 
"Hoochinski." 
</P>
<P>
It's not that TV isn't loaded with some very wise programs showing wild animals 
in their natural habitats, only that the humans-as-animals theme, and vice 
versa, has an even longer, hairier tradition. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Gentle Ben the bear and super dogs Rin Tin Tin and Lassie didn't 
talk as we do, they were invested with some of the highest of human traits, 
such as incredible bravery and astonishing intelligence. Good old Lassie once 
not only fell in love with a male collie, but was also consistently psychic, 
always seeming to know exactly when it was time to leave the cozy house and go 
pull little Timmy out of the river. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Ed the horse did talk like us, and sing like us, too. 
</P>
<P>
However, the series that few who saw it will forget -- and NBC would like to -- 
is "Manimal," which lasted three months into the 1983 season, endearing a 
minuscule segment of America to a man for all skins -- a suave, handsome 
superhero criminologist able to transform himself into any animal the occasion 
demanded. Give him time for a few contractions and some heavy breathing and he 
could be a snarling panther, a hissing cobra or a silently observing hawk. 
</P>
<P>
He never did catch Frisbees as a dog, however, disqualifying him for "Prime 
Time Pets." 
</P>
<P>
Still, he's missed. NBC should bring him back as "Manimalinski."

NASA SCIENTISTS UP IN AIR OVER 'BLIND' HUBBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE DYE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Scientists trying to correct the faulty vision of the Hubble Space Telescope 
have found themselves in the dismal position of an optometrist trying to 
provide eyeglasses for a patient he can only contact by telephone. Providing 
the glasses is the easy part. Diagnosing the disease may be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, according to the experts, it may well be that the challenge will 
prove too great, and Hubble will never see with the clarity that had been so 
eagerly awaited. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists faced with such a challenge normally would spend months in the 
laboratory, working on the telescope itself, examining the tiny flaw in its 
optics with microscopes and measuring every subtle change in the curvature of 
its 94-inch primary mirror and its 12-inch secondary mirror with the most 
sensitive instruments in the world of precision optics. 
</P>
<P>
They would not be content until they could produce photographs with electron 
microscopes and perfect measurements of a flaw that is probably no larger than 
one-fiftieth the thickness of a human hair. 
</P>
<P>
This time, they cannot do that. Since extensive tests failed to reveal the flaw 
when the mirrors were manufactured nearly a decade ago, the telescope was 
launched into orbit with optics that have left the giant scope virtually blind. 
It is 381 miles above the Earth, far removed from the labs that could make 
short work of finding the flaw -- or flaws -- if it were on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists cannot go up and get it because returning the telescope to the 
ground would subject it to such contamination during the descent through the 
atmosphere -- when vents in the shuttle's cargo bay must be left open -- that 
it would probably be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
So they will have to work with the telescope where it is, unaided by the 
traditional tools of optical engineering, and there is a real possibility that 
they will fail. 
</P>
<P>
To succeed, scientists and engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
Pasadena must manufacture a series of eight tiny lenses, each no bigger than a 
human thumb, that will refocus the light from the 94-inch primary mirror and 
remove the flaw. And that is the easy part. 
</P>
<P>
Before they can do that, scientists must determine the exact nature of the flaw 
and where it is in the telescope's optical system. And no one is sure they can 
do that. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I worry about at night, the only thing that causes me to lose 
sleep, is not getting the diagnosis correct," said John T. Trauger, JPL's 
project scientist on the "second generation" camera that will replace the one 
aboard the Hubble. 
</P>
<P>
The replacement camera is scheduled to be launched in about three years, and 
astronauts are to pull out the flawed telephone booth-sized camera and slip in 
the new instrument. 
</P>
<P>
If scientists have done their work right, the new camera will for the first 
time allow the telescope to live up to its highly publicized promise. But what 
if they fail? 
</P>
<P>
"We won't get a second chance," Trauger said, because costs and political 
pressures would probably preclude ever trying again. 
</P>
<P>
"There's going to be a lot of reputations on the line," he added. 
</P>
<P>
James Westphal of Caltech, who labored 13 years as the project scientist on the 
camera now rendered useless, agrees that if the wizards of JPL, aided by scores 
of experts across the country, are unsuccessful, the telescope will probably be 
regarded as one of the space program's most spectacular embarrassments. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be a total disaster," Westphal said. 
</P>
<P>
Westphal, Trauger and the teams that will be working with them during the 
coming months must try to resolve a problem they did not create. There is 
nothing wrong with the camera that is aboard the telescope. 
</P>
<P>
The mirrors serve the same function as a telephoto lens used by photographers 
on Earth. But it doesn't make any difference how good the camera is if the 
telephoto lens itself is flawed. 
</P>
<P>
Experts at JPL will spend the next two months studying images from the 
telescope to see if they can equip a new camera with corrective lenses to cure 
the Hubble's fuzzy vision. 
</P>
<P>
Modifications to an upgraded camera that the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration had already planned to add to the telescope in 1993 could 
correct the flaw by deliberately introducing errors that would offset those 
caused by the faulty mirror. In this case, two wrongs could make a right. 
</P>
<P>
The scientists are looking for help from the technical record dating back to 
the period, nearly a decade ago, when the telescope's mirrors were under 
construction at Perkin-Elmer Corp. in Danbury, Conn. Perkin-Elmer, which was 
acquired about a year ago by Hughes Aircraft and renamed Hughes Danbury Optical 
Systems Inc., is one of the world's leading manufacturers of precision optics. 
But somehow during the fabrication of the mirrors for the Hubble, something 
went terribly wrong. 
</P>
<P>
It may be that in the records of the manufacturing and testing of the mirrors 
some clue will be found: some slight error in the formula for the curvature of 
the mirrors or some piece of faulty equipment. That would make the job a lot 
easier. A committee set up by NASA is looking for clues, but a lot can happen 
over the years to cloud the record. 
</P>
<P>
For now, scientists must assume that they have to solve the problem themselves 
by carefully analyzing images from the telescope, in hopes of pinpointing the 
nature of the flaw and exactly where it is in the complex optical system. 
</P>
<P>
Trauger and others suspect that the flaw lies in the telescope's primary 
mirror. The huge piece of glass had to be polished to the highest degree of 
precision ever. Making the job more difficult, the primary mirror in the 
telescope is not shaped like a sphere, which would be easier to grind. It is a 
parabola, which means the shape changes according to the distance from the 
center so that it can focus all the light falling on its entire surface on a 
single point. 
</P>
<P>
As the grinding wheel moves out from the center, it has to constantly change 
its position according to mathematical formulas that will give the mirror its 
correct shape. Most experts theorize that -- possibly because of something as 
simple as a typographical error -- the mirror flattens out slightly toward its 
outer edge. Light striking that area would be scattered over the focal plane 
instead of concentrating at the center, producing a fuzzy image. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists are analyzing scores of images from the Hubble to see if they reveal 
the nature of the flaw. The images the scientists are producing consist of 
computer graphics, not celestial photographs, designed to help diagnose the 
problem. The amount of light falling on the camera's electronic "eye" is 
measured and simulated on a computer, producing the graphic. 
</P>
<P>
If the telescope was working properly, the light would be concentrated at the 
center of the image and appear as a spike on the computer monitor. The spike 
would rise from a flat base because all the light would be focused on a single 
point. 
</P>
<P>
But a flawed optical system produces a spike rising from a turbulent base, 
looking like a mountain peak rising from a series of foothills, because some of 
the light is diffused. Buried in the hills and valleys at the base of the peak 
is the secret of Hubble's problem. 
</P>
<P>
If they can figure out the nature of the flaw, the scientists will create a 
computer image of a celestial target as it should appear. Then they will point 
the telescope at the target and see if they get the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
They will do that over and over until they are confident they have isolated the 
flaw. Once they know exactly what it is, Trauger said, new lenses can be built 
for the second-generation camera. 
</P>
<P>
"If you give us an error, we can fix it," he said. "But first we have to know 
what it is." 
</P>
<P>
For the next two or three months, scientists will grapple with understanding 
the precise nature of the flaw. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody said it would be easy," Trauger said. 
</P>
<P>
If they succeed, the only thing left will be to fly the new camera up to the 
telescope aboard the space shuttle, put it on and hope nothing else goes wrong. 
</P>
<P>
By then, perhaps, NASA will have figured out what gremlin caused the problem in 
the first place. The space agency is struggling to explain how such an error 
could have gone undetected and the telescope could have been launched with a 
flawed optical system. 
</P>
<P>
There were many tests, by both Perkin-Elmer and NASA, aimed at preventing just 
this sort of thing from happening, and many scientists are astounded that the 
error could have slipped through. 
</P>
<P>
The mirrors were tested independently, not as a single optical system, because 
testing them together would have been so expensive and time-consuming that it 
was considered impractical. It would have been necessary to have built a huge 
structure and several other lenses to the same precise standards as the 
telescope to detect any errors. 
</P>
<P>
Those tests, NASA officials insist, would have cost at least $100 million, 
probably much more. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, the record clearly shows that in the early 1980s, executives at the 
space agency had great faith in Perkin-Elmer's performance, despite the fact 
that the project was running months behind schedule and cost overruns were 
soaring. 
</P>
<P>
James M. Beggs, then NASA's administrator, testified before a congressional 
committee in 1983 that the company was six months behind and slipping further. 
He was asked to explain why NASA had given Perkin-Elmer $2.5 million in "award 
fees" despite what one congressman called "a very poor technical performance." 
</P>
<P>
"Because the award fee was based on the technical progress that they had 
demonstrated," Beggs testified. "They had also delivered a mirror that exceeded 
specifications. They had also done an above-average job in our judgment on the 
remainder of the optics. In short, on that part of the job, they have performed 
superbly." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the overruns, Perkin-Elmer continued to receive bonus payments. 
According to a 1989 NASA inspector general's audit, the contractor was awarded 
$6 million through April, 1987. If NASA had fully considered the cost overruns, 
the bonuses could have been reduced by $1 million, the audit said.

Solving The Hubble's Problems 
</P>
<P>
To solve the problems of the ailing Hubble Space Telescope, scientists and 
engineers at the JetPropulsion Laboratory will have to rely heavily upon 
computer graphics that they hope will reveal what is wrong with the telescope's 
optics. The chart on the left shows how light from a distant star should appear 
in a computer graphic-as a single peak rising from a flat base-if the telescope 
were working correctly. But because of a flaw in the telescope's mirrors, the 
peak of starlight rises from a hilly surface (right). The hills at the base of 
the peak result from light that cannot be focused because of the optical flaws, 
and they would make the star appear fuzzy. By studing the "hills" at the base 
of the peak, the scientists hope to correctly analyze the flaws in the optical 
system and add correcting lenses to a new camera that will be attached to the 
telescope in about three years.

GORBACHEV PLEADS CASE TO WORKERS; 
</P>

REFORMS: HE TELLS RANK-AND-FILE CONGRESS MEMBERS THAT PARTY WILL BE DEAD 
WITHOUT CHANGES. 'AM I NEEDED BY YOU?' HE ASKS.

<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, warning that his reforms are threatened 
by conservative opposition, on Sunday told the workers and farmers attending 
the 28th Communist Party Congress that they must back him or see perestroika 
fail. 
</P>
<P>
"Perestroika is now at such a crucial stage that some people are trying to stop 
it, binding its legs and all that, in order to maintain their own positions of 
power," Gorbachev said. 
</P>
<P>
"But for us to work differently and to obtain different results from our work, 
for us to restore the incentives in agriculture, in industry and in our whole 
state, we have to continue perestroika." 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating further conservative attacks on his political and economic 
reforms during the final debates this week on a new party platform, Gorbachev 
sought the support of the rank-and-file delegates at the congress during a 
four-hour meeting at the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
"They criticize me personally or the Politburo and debate whether to remove 
us," he said, according to delegates who were present. "I will listen to it 
all, but you will decide everything. Am I needed by you? You will decide." 
</P>
<P>
Soviet workers and farmers must realize, Gorbachev said later on Soviet 
television, that their interests lie in radical reforms that would bring them 
the power, politically and economically, to improve their own lives directly, 
reversing decades of centralized control. 
</P>
<P>
And the party must realize, he added, that without such a change it will be 
dead and no longer be able to claim that it represents the Soviet working 
class. 
</P>
<P>
As the congress moves into its last three days, Gorbachev, in bidding for the 
delegates' support, sought to strengthen his centrist position after days of 
criticism from both radical reformers and conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed platform is expected to be brought up for debate and a possible 
vote today, and that will be followed by discussion of Gorbachev's plans for a 
reorganization of the party and then the election of a new leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev told the workers and farmers that, although together they constitute 
only 16% of the delegates to the congress, they will have a decisive role in 
the final voting as reformers and conservatives battle over the future of the 
party. 
</P>
<P>
"I maintain only one thing -- the policy that I have chosen, I will pursue," 
delegates quoted him as saying, "and for me the greatest reward is that my 
motherland will live." 
</P>
<P>
But the rank-and-file delegates' questions, focusing on food shortages, 
proposed price increases, the chronic housing crisis, rising crime and recent 
ethnic conflicts, were as sharp as any that the leadership has faced over the 
past week during the major policy debates. 
</P>
<P>
"People feel that the processes of renewal are going slowly, both at the 
grass-roots level and in the center," Gorbachev said after the session. "That 
is why they question the Central Committee, the Politburo and me as the general 
secretary so seriously." 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that the party is "in debt" to the country's workers and 
farmers, having promised them much over the years but delivered a great deal 
less, and he again pleaded for further patience in the implementation of 
perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev nevertheless appealed to the country's coal miners not to proceed 
with a one-day, political "warning strike" planned for Wednesday, the day that 
the congress is due to conclude, in a signal to the party leadership that 
results are needed, not more words. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand the difficulties and the problems of the miners," Gorbachev 
said. "We understand that they want to make clear for us that perestroika does 
not go the way they would like. They want to signal us to move more quickly on 
reforms. We understand this signal. 
</P>
<P>
"But to act with these methods -- somebody is evidently provoking them -- is 
impermissible. Everyone should understand that this is not the time for 
ultimatums. This is an extreme means of action, especially when we are at the 
brink of fundamental changes. It is too much of a luxury when we are so 
involved in such deep changes to get involved in a conflict situation." 
</P>
<P>
Although only scheduled for a day, the miners' strike could grow, just as work 
stoppages did last year, Soviet leaders fear, and thus greatly damage the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
Concern is also real about the impact of such a political strike coming at the 
conclusion of the party congress, which was intended to give perestroika a new 
political and psychological impetus. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope that those comrades, the miners, hear us," Gorbachev said. "We value 
the position of the miners quite highly, but we want it to be responsible, 
especially now." 
</P>
<P>
The party congress, the most open and probably the most tumultuous in decades, 
is still far from a consensus on the principal issues before it, Soviet 
political commentators said on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is little doubt that Gorbachev will be reelected as the party 
leader, the mandate he will have for bolder reforms remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
"Only a miracle can bring the congress to a consensus," Eduard F. Gonzalez 
wrote Sunday in the government newspaper Izvestia. "I do not mean in 
resolutions, of course, because there will be enough neutral words to satisfy 
all sides. But how do you bring vital positions closer when people do not even 
want to listen to each other? 
</P>
<P>
"Only a referendum held after the congress will really show where the country's 
Communists would like to go -- to the right or to the left.

BANANA BOOM; 
</P>
<P>
WARM 'MICROCLIMATE' MAKES TROPICAL FRUIT THRIVE ON SOUTHLAND PLANTATION

<P>
Along U.S. 101 near the Ventura-Santa Barbara county line lies a small tropical 
paradise that for years has astonished weather analysts and farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Tucked between the ocean and 300-foot-high bluffs is a place called La 
Conchita, a seaside community that is also the home of the only commercial 
banana plantation in the continental United States, according to the 
International Banana Assn. 
</P>
<P>
There, 10,000 banana trees are fanned by balmy ocean breezes, basking in an 
island of frost-free weather. When Ventura freezes over, the Seaside Banana 
Farm is frost-free. When Santa Barbara shivers, bananas at the 12-acre 
plantation ripen on the stalk. 
</P>
<P>
One of the managers of the tiny banana republic is Doug Richardson, 41, an 
occasional landscaper who began cultivating bananas six years ago as an 
experiment in his front yard. He found the banana plants he was growing for 
ground cover actually were producing tasty fruit. In 1985, he decided to grow 
them commercially. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson said that up until then, growing bananas "was unheard of in this 
state." 
</P>
<P>
A geography major at UC Santa Barbara, Richardson researched temperatures in 
countries where bananas are grown. 
</P>
<P>
"What I discovered is that we have a unique climate here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During the next few months of summer, the plantation will enjoy hothouse 
temperatures hovering between 85 and 95 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson's partner, Paul Turner, 43, said he was a skeptical at first. But 
old-timers told him they had never seen a frost in La Conchita. Then he learned 
that the plantation has higher temperatures than the Canary Islands off the 
coast of Africa. "I figured that if they can do it there, we could do it too," 
Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
The farm produces 10 to 20 tons of bananas per acre every year, compared to 25 
to 30 tons on other plantations. Two years ago, the two were quoted as saying 
that they hoped to gross about $200,000. But today Richardson and Turner are 
more circumspect about what they garner from nearly a quarter of a million 
pounds of bananas sold every year. 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural officials and other farmers acknowledged that the plantation is an 
environmental oddity. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to grow bananas on the Oxnard Plain and they froze," said Rob Brokaw, 
a grower who also specializes in rare and exotic fruits. 
</P>
<P>
The plantation does well in the winter because the ocean -- with its temperate 
currents only a few hundred yards away -- maintains a moderate temperature, 
said Bob Brendler, an adviser with University of California Cooperative 
Extension. 
</P>
<P>
The moderate air coming off the ocean moves up the area's steep slopes, 
breaking up any stagnant, freezing air. In summer, ocean breezes bathe the area 
with cool, humid air, mimicking the climate of the tropics. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson and Turner admit that their La Conchita plantation is not the only 
hot spot in the county. Bananas are grown in Carpinteria, about five miles 
away, but the crop is much smaller. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Moore, top banana of the International Banana Assn., called the farm a 
"climatic nonconformity." 
</P>
<P>
Banana plantations usually are located in subtropical climates where the 
temperatures rarely dip below 55 degrees, Moore said. Banana farming was 
previously thought impossible in California, away from the porous volcanic soil 
that plants favor, he said. But Seaside Banana Farm has changed his mind. "It's 
a very unusual spot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the farm's success goes beyond climatological luck. The farm requires 
intensive care. Instead of relying on tropical rainfall, the two farmers 
planted drought-resistant banana tubers and lined the groves with black 
irrigation pipes. 
</P>
<P>
Every stalk of bananas is covered with a blue plastic bag to speed the ripening 
process and prevent damage from leaves. Each banana tree is hand-cultivated by 
a hired crew of six workers and small trees are placed in pots. 
</P>
<P>
At $1 to $4 a pound, the bananas are not cheap. They are sold to organic food 
stores and pricey restaurants across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson and Turner say that one of their plans is to turn the plantation 
into a roadside attraction where a guide would conduct 20-minute tours through 
the groves, explaining the origin of banana plants. 
</P>
<P>
But neither Richardson nor Turner want to turn their plantation into a tropical 
Knott's Berry Farm. "It could become an A-1 tourist trap," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're occupied in our farm," Richardson said. "We're just down and dirty 
farmers."

DOCUMENTS: RICHARD T. SILBERMAN OFFERED FBI AGENTS ALLEGEDLY INCRIMINATING 
EVIDENCE ABOUT THE ASSEMBLY SPEAKER. COURT RECORDS SAY THE BUSINESSMAN SOUGHT 
LENIENCY IN MONEY-LAUNDERING CASE.

<P>
Richard T. Silberman, once the top aide to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., sat 
face to face with FBI agents in a San Diego hotel room, his reputation and his 
freedom in jeopardy. Federal agents had detained him on suspicion of laundering 
money that an undercover agent had characterized as profits from an illegal 
narcotics deal. 
</P>
<P>
Desperate to avoid prosecution, Silberman, a consummate negotiator, made an 
offer, according to court documents and trial testimony: In exchange for 
leniency, he would provide incriminating information about Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown, the San Francisco Democrat considered the state's second most 
powerful politician after the governor. Silberman told the agents that Brown's 
law firm had connections to businesses with a stake in legislation under the 
powerful lawmaker's control, and he offered to expose the ties. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the FBI turned down Silberman's proposal. They arrested the San 
Diego businessman and prosecutors put him on trial. Last month, he was 
convicted on a federal currency charge and is in jail in San Diego awaiting 
sentencing to federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman's allegations about Brown and others, made more than a year ago, were 
revealed in court documents filed in May by Silberman's lawyers. Their 
publication Friday has rankled the Assembly leader, who long has complained 
that the police and the FBI are out to get him. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, in an interview with The Times, emphatically denied Silberman's 
accusations, which he said were "totally and completely unsupported." 
</P>
<P>
"It's an irresponsible allegation made by a sick man who's been convicted," 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
Notes of the meeting between Silberman and FBI Agent Charles Walker indicate 
that Silberman described Chula Vista City Councilman David Malcolm as Brown's 
"bagman" and said Brown's San Francisco law office had a connection to 
legislation involving the state unitary tax law and the proposed merger of 
Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the notes read: 
</P>
<P>
"7/83 -- Jap. meeting re unitary tax" 
</P>
<P>
"25K 'legal fee' -- millions in savings" 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Brown's staff, Silberman lobbied the Legislature on behalf of 
Japanese business interests seeking to overhaul the state's unitary tax law, 
which involves the way the state assesses multinational corporations that do 
business in California. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the Legislature revised the system in a way that lightened the 
California tax burden on foreign corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Silberman, as a top Democratic Party figure and a lobbyist, would have been 
well positioned to broker or observe a deal between the Speaker and the 
Japanese businesses. But Brown emphatically denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd really like to have him (Silberman) go through my client list and tell me 
which one of those non-Japanese were involved in the unitary matter," Brown 
said. "I represent developers and movie stars and record executives and that's 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Brown also said his law firm has never been connected to Southern California 
Edison. And he said he had "no idea" why Silberman would describe Malcolm as 
his "bagman" -- a term used in political circles to describe a person who acts 
as an intermediary for illicit payments from special interests to elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Brown twice has appointed Malcolm to the state Coastal Commission, but he said 
he first did so at the recommendation of local officials and members of the 
Legislature. He said the two are not close and noted that Malcolm, a 
Republican, raises campaign contributions for GOP politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could get him to raise money for me," Brown said. He said Malcolm has 
had no connection to his law firm and has never recommended clients to him. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his denials, Brown said he could understand why Silberman, seeking to 
escape prosecution, would try to shift the attention to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
"I practiced law for a long time, and every time I've represented anybody who's 
gotten nailed, the first thing they start asking me about is, is there some way 
we can give them (the police) somebody," Brown said. "They say we'll give them 
somebody who can't get back at us, and we'll give them somebody they might 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
"Why Willie Brown? I have no idea. I have no connection at all."

IMPASSE OVER STATE BUDGET STILL STANDS;

FUNDING: A MEETING BETWEEN DEUKMEJIAN AND LAWMAKERS GETS NOWHERE. THE GOVERNOR 
WON'T ACCEPT PROPOSED TAX AND FEE HIKES.

Seven days into the new fiscal year and still without a budget or a plan to pay 
the state's growing backlog of bills, Gov. George Deukmejian and legislative 
leaders met Sunday and talked philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
Seemingly no further along after their 10th meeting than they were when they 
began serious talks in June about the budget crisis, lawmakers emerged from the 
meeting in the governor's office echoing verses from the same record they have 
been playing for five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Senate leaders had said they were hopeful that Sunday's meeting 
would be productive. 
</P>
<P>
The top Republican and Democratic leaders expected to be able to lay a 
budget-balancing plan before the governor that involved cuts of $1 billion from 
the proposed $56-billion state budget and revenue hikes of $1 billion in 
assorted tax and fee increases. It was considered a plan that would allow both 
Republicans and Democrats to save face, something considered essential to any 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
But the plan never got off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), who put together the 
proposal with Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno, said Sunday it was still 
being fine-tuned. 
</P>
<P>
But Roberti acknowledged that it didn't help when Deukmejian, even before they 
had a chance to lay the deal out, indicated "he wasn't too excited about" about 
the $1 billion in tax and fee increases. 
</P>
<P>
With that out of the way, "the discussion was more philosophical," said 
Deukmejian Chief of Staff Michael R. Frost. He added, "There is no change in 
philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
Later, both the Senate and Assembly held a rare Sunday floor session, but 
little was accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
Privately, some lawmakers were saying that the convening of the two houses had 
more to do with fear of going home without working on the budget than with 
actual efforts to pass a budget for the 1990-91 fiscal year that began July 1. 
Last week, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) acknowledged as much 
when he said lawmakers wouldn't "dare" take the weekend off until they passed a 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
There were indications that many of the 120 members of the Legislature were 
just beginning to wake up to the fact that the state faces a severe budget 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Frost, who is part of the governor's lobbying effort with the Legislature, said 
Sunday that "the members are just now getting to the point where they 
understand the depth of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
This is the way things stood Sunday: 
</P>
<P>
The Republican governor still does not want tax increases, believing that the 
state can and must live with budget reductions of $3.6 billion, since spending 
would grow 7% to 8% even with cuts of that magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats still claim that Deukmejian isn't living in the real world if he 
thinks that the Democratic-controlled Legislature would go along with those 
kinds of cuts, saying that Deukmejian's 7% growth is not nearly enough to keep 
up with huge increases in welfare caseloads, public school enrollments and 
state prisoner populations. 
</P>
<P>
Aggravating the problem is the fact that the state officeholders, in facing the 
funding crisis, have virtually been put in a straitjacket by a variety of legal 
requirements, court decisions, voter-approved initiatives and federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
This likely will be Deukmejian's last fight with his long-term adversaries, 
Brown and Roberti. He is leaving office early next year, retiring to private 
life. Rather than go quietly, the lame-duck governor has drawn the proverbial 
line in the sand and refuses to yield. 
</P>
<P>
Frost, when asked how far apart the two sides were, said, "$3.6 billion."

HOUSE PANEL SAYS SOVIET THREAT IS DEAD ;

HE REPEATS A CALL FOR CUTS IN THE MILITARY BUDGET.

<P>
A key House Armed Services Committee panel, divided along party lines, 
concluded Sunday that the threat to the United States and NATO by Soviet 
conventional forces "is greatly diminished and cannot be revived." The 
assessment prompted Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) to reiterate calls for 
selective cuts in the U.S. defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
The report said that President Bush's $306.9-billion defense request for next 
year assumes that the Soviet threat could be restored. Such assumptions, Aspin 
said in a statement, "don't jibe with reality anymore. Many of the changes are 
irreversible, and that means we can cut selectively without jeopardizing our 
security." 
</P>
<P>
But the conclusion was dismissed as far too optimistic by Rep. William L. 
Dickinson (R-Ala.), the committee's ranking Republican. 
</P>
<P>
"Endorsing this report is tantamount to believing that the Soviet Union is 
already militarily impotent and not a global power to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
"Such a view is more wishful thinking than a reflection of reality," he said 
</P>
<P>
Aspin did not estimate the size of the cuts that he believes could be made on 
the basis of the report. In the past, however, he has advocated a cut of 20% 
spread over five years. 
</P>
<P>
The report itself, issued by the committee's defense policy panel, did not 
explicitly call for budget cuts. But it did say that the debate over its 
conclusions "will determine what we do in the fiscal year 1991 defense budget." 
</P>
<P>
"The worst thing we can do is spend too little on defense," the panel said. 
"The next worst thing we can do is spend too much." 
</P>
<P>
The conclusions were endorsed by all 17 Democratic members of the panel led by 
Aspin, who is chairman of both the committee and the panel. All 15 Republican 
members dissented. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout its report, the panel appeared to lean heavily on many of the 
assessments of CIA Director William H. Webster, who has been much more 
optimistic about the irreversibility of the declining Soviet threat than 
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
The panel said that "the likelihood of a bolt-out-of-the-blue Soviet strategic 
attack has always been small," since any Soviet nuclear attack on the United 
States would trigger a terrifying retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
"The most likely scenario leading to nuclear war has always been escalation 
from a conflict in Europe," the panel said, adding that, with the breakup of 
the Warsaw Pact, the possibility of this risk has declined. 
</P>
<P>
The report said 50% to 60% of U.S. defense spending still goes to maintaining 
the ability to mobilize 10 divisions in 10 days against a Warsaw Pact invasion 
of Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The panel also concluded that: 
</P>
<P>
* The Soviet conventional threat elsewhere has also declined, "although not as 
precipitously as in Europe" and "large-scale Soviet military interventions 
outside of Soviet territory seem beyond the Red Army's powers, no matter who 
rules in Moscow." 
</P>
<P>
* "While the Soviet Union continues to modernize its strategic forces, the risk 
of nuclear war has receded." 
</P>
<P>
* Soviet military spending is clearly on the decline. "The growing economic 
crisis in the Soviet Union raises serious doubt that Soviets can maintain its 
current pace of weapons modernization and adds significant uncertainty about 
what the Soviet threat will look like in the future."

TEXAS: THE PRESIDENT WELCOMES FELLOW WORLD LEADERS TO HIS HOME STATE. THEY

<P>
With $1,000 ostrich-skin cowboy boots for their feet, handmade Texan china for 
their barbecue and an air-conditioned arena for their rodeo, President Bush 
welcomed summit guests to his adopted hometown Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
At least the three who managed to show up. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu was the first to arrive, entering the 
Astroarena under an arch emblazoned "Howdy Partner" and bowing and shaking 
hands as he greeted Bush. 
</P>
<P>
World-leader casual was the style note of the day: blue blazers over golf 
shirts for the men, expensively informal dresses for the women. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Bush wore a blue-and-white checked gingham cowgirl dress. Treasury 
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady wore a bright red-orange shirt that matched the 
cowboy bandanna around the neck of his wife, Katherine. Canadian Prime Minister 
Brian Mulroney displayed a broad-brimmed white Stetson hat. 
</P>
<P>
But not all were so relaxed. Bush's domestic policy adviser, Roger Porter, wore 
a pocketful of pens in his blue oxford-cloth shirt. And Margaret Thatcher, the 
indomitable British Prime Minister, maintained her aversion to relaxation in 
public, arriving in a checkered suit and clutching a white purse. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher also passed up the chance to pitch horseshoes. As steers lowed in the 
background, Kaifu took his turn, grimacing as he awkwardly tossed a shoe into 
the lights that lined the horseshoe pit. Mulroney did no better. Bush hit two 
ringers in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, Mulroney and European Community Commission President Jacques Delors 
showed off the boots, which Houston boot-maker Rocky Carroll had crafted for 
Bush to present as gifts. Each pair, emblazoned with the silhouette of Texas 
and the flags of each of the seven summit nations, took him 40 hours to make, 
according to Carroll. "These are the finest boots I've ever made," he said. 
</P>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti 
will get their boots even though they skipped the party. Like many of the 
thousands of diplomats, bureaucrats and reporters gathered here for the annual 
summit of the world's chief economic powers, which formally begins today, both 
had a higher priority -- soccer -- and remained in Rome to watch Germany's 
World Cup final match against Argentina. West Germany won, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
The summit's seventh participant, French President Francois Mitterrand, also 
skipped the party. Mitterrand, who often prefers to arrive at international 
summits last -- the spot of honor in international protocol -- announced that 
he would not be arriving until today. 
</P>
<P>
Those who did arrive watched a demonstration of rodeo and country music that 
began with Suzy Mills, a rider from San Diego, cantering her horse out of a 
huge red, white and blue boot and circling the air-conditioned arena bearing an 
American flag. "Hello and howdy and welcome to Texas," the announcer declared. 
</P>
<P>
With the temperature and humidity both in the high 90s, air conditioning is a 
Houston necessity. A coalition of environmental groups, trying to dramatize 
their concern over global warming, put an ice sculpture of the globe in a 
downtown park. They had hoped it would melt slowly, providing a nice "visual" 
for the hordes of television crews swarming around the summit. But before noon, 
the globe was a puddle. 
</P>
<P>
Bush, whose idea it was to hold the summit in Houston in July, insisted, 
however, that he was undeterred by the sultry weather. After attending church 
on Sunday morning, he took a 30-minute jog through the park near the hotel that 
serves as his legal voting residence here. "It's not bad yet," Bush said of the 
heat before stripping off his T-shirt and diving into his waiting, and 
air-conditioned, limousine. 
</P>
<P>
The day before the actual beginning of the summit was something of a mix, with 
spare-no-expense bashes for the press being thrown only a short distance from 
the site of demonstrations by the Ku Klux Klan. 
</P>
<P>
The official summit greeting ceremony will he held this morning.

LIBERIA REBELS RETREAT FROM HUB OF CAPITAL;

AFRICA: CITY SEES A LULL IN FIGHTING. INSURGENTS TRYING TO TOPPLE PRESIDENT DOE

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rebels retreated to the outskirts of Monrovia on Sunday, and a spokesman said 
insurgents surrounding the besieged West African capital want to spare civilian 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
President Samuel K. Doe on Friday announced a cease-fire in the six-month-old 
civil war, but the spokesman denied that the rebels of the National Patriotic 
Front of Liberia, led by former Doe associate Charles Taylor, were observing 
the cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no agreement between us and Doe, and we have made it very, very clear 
that there will be no cease-fire from our side," chief rebel spokesman Thomas 
Woewiyu told Reuters news agency in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. He spoke from an 
undisclosed location in West Africa. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of fighting Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers, who have been on shooting and looting sprees each night since the 
rebels attacked the capital a week ago, said they believed the rebels had 
withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear whether the rebels had retreated to regroup and await 
reinforcements. Infighting among the rebels was reported at the beginning of 
last week by residents contacted by radio behind rebel lines in northern 
Liberia. 
</P>
<P>
Monrovians who ventured out Sunday found roads littered with bodies. One 
resident said he saw the bodies of 16 civilians, including two small children, 
near the port. 
</P>
<P>
Soldiers went to the city's main hospital to ask for 86 body bags to take to an 
eastern suburb where a battle raged for much of last week. Residents said they 
also saw soldiers bury 20 bodies on a beach near Doe's heavily fortified 
seaside mansion. 
</P>
<P>
"Doe is in there with a lot of civilians and is holding them hostage. . . . 
What we are doing is taking precautions to make sure we can bring this madman 
under control without unnecessary killing of civilians," Woewiyu said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every entrance and every exit to the city has been closed by us," he said, 
adding that rebel forces were within two miles of Doe's mansion. 
</P>
<P>
Woewiyu said he would attend new peace talks in Freetown, Sierra Leone, 
mediated by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). This move 
suggested that the rebels' hopes of an early surrender by Doe were fading. 
</P>
<P>
The NPFL did not send delegates to last Friday's scheduled opening session of 
the talks. Woewiyu said the rebel movement was annoyed by ECOWAS attempts to 
impose preconditions on a peace settlement. 
</P>
<P>
These included blocking NPFL leader Taylor from assuming the leadership of an 
interim government and sending an ECOWAS multinational peacekeeping force to 
Liberia to prevent reprisal killings, Woewiyu said. 
</P>
<P>
In the event of a rebel takeover, he added, there would be no reprisals against 
members of Doe's Krahn tribe, who form the backbone of the government army, and 
the Mandingo trading community, closely associated with Doe's regime.

The wife of mixed-race anti-apartheid cleric Allan Boesak said their marriage

ALLEGED ALIEN SMUGGLERS KIDNAP 2 CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A couple allegedly kidnaped two children on a Los Angeles street corner Sunday 
when their mother failed to come up with the money she owed them for smuggling 
the two across the Mexican border, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said the unidentified man and woman snatched 9-year-old Nasario 
Morales and his 11-year-old sister, Maria, at about 10:30 a.m. from the corner 
of 23rd and Los Angeles streets. 
</P>
<P>
"This is basically a coyote caper," Officer Richard Monfils said, referring to 
the term often used to describe alien smugglers. "They brought the kids in from 
Mexico, they didn't get paid, and so they snatched the kids." 
</P>
<P>
Monfils said advisories have been issued to the Border Patrol, the Immigration 
and Naturalization Service and to law enforcement officials throughout Los 
Angeles and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
The children's mother, Ernestina Cruz Bautista, apparently owed the couple 
about $500 for smuggling the children into the country two days ago, Monfils 
said. 
</P>
<P>
She went to the street corner Sunday morning to meet with the couple, who upon 
learning that she did not have the payment, snatched the children when she was 
not looking. 
</P>
<P>
The kidnapers fled with the children in an older model orange Chevrolet van, 
Monfils said. The officer said the van is windowless on its right side and has 
a green primer spot near its rear license plate. A possible plate number is 448 
DJR. 
</P>
<P>
The children, who have brown hair and eyes, were both wearing jeans and black 
slip-on shoes, Monfils said. 
</P>
<P>
Nasario, described as 3 feet, 11 inches tall and weighing 90 pounds, was 
wearing a a blue pullover shirt, while his sister, who is 4 feet, 6 inches and 
weighs 100 pounds, had on a blue and orange print, short-sleeved flowered 
shirt. She wears her hair in a ponytail.

ANGELS' NIGHTMARE IS A DREAM FOR HILL 
</P>

<P>
On a day when one of their most effective pitchers was infielder Donnie Hill, 
who had never pitched an inning in the major leagues, the Angels were too 
shellshocked to laugh and too aware of the absurdity to cry. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, who had pitched in high school and was indulged at Triple-A Tacoma last 
year when he begged to pitch as a professional, was the last of seven Angel 
pitchers Sunday and one of two to escape a Milwaukee onslaught that felled the 
Angels, 20-7, and shattered club records on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
"Donnie made us look bad," said Mike Fetters, who yielded four hits and a walk 
to the five batters he faced in the Brewers' 13-run fifth inning. "He made it 
look easy. I wish it were that easy." 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee's 20 runs were the most ever given up by the Angels in a game, 
eclipsing by three a mark that had been reached three times. The Brewers' fifth 
inning set records for most runs scored against the Angels in a single inning 
and most hits in an inning, 10. Milwaukee sent 11 men to bat in the fourth and 
scored six times to tie the game, 7-7, and sent 18 batters to the plate in the 
bottom of the fifth, which took 42 minutes to complete. 
</P>
<P>
"Donnie did the job," said pitching coach Marcel Lachemann, who attributed his 
other pitchers' difficulties to poor location of their pitches. "Those other 
guys were grinding and sweating and couldn't get anybody out. But the fact is, 
as much as we got knocked around today, and nobody likes to lose, I'm sure the 
Brewers would have liked to have some of those 20 runs the last two nights when 
they couldn't beat us." 
</P>
<P>
Hill, who is ambidextrous, began warming up in the sixth inning, alternating 
right-handed and left-handed tosses before entering the game in the eighth as a 
righty. He pitched one inning, giving up a walk and striking out Rob Deer. He 
shared with Willie Fraser (one hit over two innings) the distinction of being 
unscored upon. All 20 runs were earned, inflating the Angels' team earned-run 
average from 3.55 to 3.75. 
</P>
<P>
"Doug (Rader, the Angel manager) asked me if I could go and I said, 'Yeah,' " 
Hill said. "I just threw a whole bunch of changeups. It's not that I wasn't 
trying to throw a fastball. He (catcher Bill Schroeder) just called for 
changeups. I got Deer on my four-finger changeup. I didn't want to throw a 
fastball and get killed." 
</P>
<P>
In becoming the first Angel to pitch without previous major-league pitching 
experience -- Willie Smith pitched 15 games in 1964 but had pitched for Detroit 
in 1963 -- Hill acquitted himself admirably. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, Donnie couldn't even throw his best pitch," Rader said, smiling. "He 
didn't expect to pitch, so he had clipped his nails and couldn't even throw his 
knuckleball." 
</P>
<P>
"He did really well -- better than me. I couldn't get anybody out," said 
Fetters, who had earned his first major-league victory Saturday. "I was getting 
the ball up and when that happens, usually I get hit around . . . The timing 
(of the All-Star break) is perfect for me. I was on top of the world one day 
and right at the bottom the next." 
</P>
<P>
The Angels' only disappointment with Hill was that he only pitched 
right-handed. "We were expecting him to go left-handed and right-handed so it 
could be history," Luis Polonia said. "That would have made 'This Week in 
Baseball.' " 
</P>
<P>
Left fielder Darryl Hamilton led Milwaukee with six RBIs, including a grand 
slam in the fifth for his second major league home run. Jim Gantner drove in 
five and Gary Sheffield three as the Angels hit the All-Star break with a 
resounding thud and a 41-43 record. "We've got two days to recuperate and we'll 
need them," Dante Bichette said. 
</P>
<P>
"They hit everything," said Schroeder, a former Brewer whose home run to center 
in the third gave the Angels a 7-0 lead. "They hit bad pitches, they hit good 
pitches. They hit dinks and ground balls and line drives. I'm tired and I'm 
going home for two days." 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers set or tied six club records, including most runs in a game, most 
runs in an inning, most RBIs in a game, most RBIs in an inning, most hits in an 
inning and most runs scored (four by B.J. Surhoff). 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like this at this level. Maybe in college you might 
see something like this," said shortstop Bill Spiers, who had a single and a 
double in the fifth as the Brewers went through Greg Minton (1-1), Fetters and 
Mark Eichhorn. "We'll never see anything like this again." 
</P>
<P>
Which would be fine with Rader. "I've been in the game for quite some time, and 
I've never been involved with a team that scored 20 runs or had 20 scored 
against it," he said. "It's all firsts. I've been in the game for quite some 
time, so if this is the first time, I'm probably lucky." 
</P>
<P>
Unwilling to throw a starter into the game and shorthanded through attrition 
and the absence of Bryan Harvey, Rader had no choice but to use Hill. "He said 
he was good for five innings," Rader said. "I thought Donnie Hill and Willie 
Fraser did a good job, and that about sums it up for our pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
Starter Bert Blyleven couldn't hold the 7-0 lead the Angels had built on a 
two-run single in the first by Wally Joyner -- Joyner's first hit after going 0 
for 13 in two games -- a two-run home run in the second by Brian Downing and 
Schroeder's blast in the third. Milwaukee scored once in the third before 
chasing Blyleven in the fourth with a two-run home run by Dave Parker and a 
run-scoring single by Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
Gantner and Sheffield added to the damage against Scott Bailes (one earned run 
in one-third of an inning) and tied the game in the fourth against Minton, who 
allowed three runs in one-third of an inning. Singles by Hamilton and Spiers 
after a single by Greg Brock and two walks produced two runs and Gantner drove 
in two more with a double. Sheffield and Robin Yount chimed in before Parker 
ended the nightmare by popping up to third baseman Jack Howell. 
</P>
<P>
"They were getting good wood on everything," said Mark Eichhorn, who gave up 
five runs in one inning. "You've just got to go out there and keep battling." 
</P>
<P>
A dream was fulfilled in the middle of a nightmare Sunday, although a Hall of 
Fame pitching career probably wasn't born. Said Hill, "I haven't given my Cy 
Young (Award) speech too much thought." 
</P>
<P>
Angel Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's game took three hours 34 minutes, for a total of 12 hours and 50 
minutes for the three-game series. The 13-run loss was two short of the Angels' 
club record, set in a 17-2 loss to the Chicago White Sox on May 31, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
Bryan Harvey was given an extra day's leave Sunday to be with his father, Stan, 
who suffered a heart attack last week. Stan Harvey has improved from critical 
condition to guarded in a North Carolina hospital. Harvey is expected to rejoin 
the Angels after the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Langston will pitch in Seattle for the first time since the Mariners 
traded him to the Montreal Expos last season. Langston, who led the American 
League in strikeouts three times while with Seattle, will start the Angels' 
makeup game at the Kingdome Wednesday. Kirk McCaskill will pitch Thursday when 
the Angels open a 10-game homestand, followed by Jim Abbott, Bert Blyleven and 
Chuck Finley. That represents a return to the season-opening rotation. 
</P>
<P>

GIBSON, CLAIRE SHOUT BEFORE DODGER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Who says there is no fight left in these Dodgers? 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the start of a 7-2 loss to Pittsburgh Sunday, outfielder Kirk 
Gibson engaged in a heated shouting match with Vice President Fred Claire in 
Manager Tom Lasorda's office. 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda's door was closed, but the shouting was loud enough to be heard 
throughout the clubhouse. Although neither Claire nor Lasorda would comment on 
the nature of the dispute, it was apparently a culmination of frustration over 
Gibson's situation on the team. 
</P>
<P>
Coming on the final day before the All-Star break, it provided a fitting end to 
a fitful first half in which the Dodgers finished with 10 losses in their last 
16 games and a 39-43 record. 
</P>
<P>
"This team is going to have to get a lot more together, that's for sure," 
Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the team said the meeting, which occurred about 11:30 a.m., 
began with Gibson asking about his status with the team. Two weeks ago, sources 
said he requested a trade because he wants to return to his Detroit-area roots 
and because he had not been offered a new contract, a report which the Dodgers 
would not deny but which Gibson claimed was "wrong." 
</P>
<P>
While discussing Gibson's status with him Sunday, Claire reportedly became 
upset and began scolding Gibson. He reportedly told Gibson that he should think 
less about himself and more about the team. He accused Gibson of having a bad 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Gibson, who has played out of position in center field this season without 
complaint, became incensed with the remarks and began shouting. The two men 
reportedly began stalking each other around the room with Lasorda serving as 
referee. 
</P>
<P>
When the meeting ended, Gibson left the office to the stares of hushed 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened in there was my business," Gibson later said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Lasorda: "Was there yelling in there? I don't think there was yelling. It 
all depends on what you think is yelling. 
</P>
<P>
"My voice comes through that door all the time when I'm talking to (coach) Bill 
Russell and I love Bill Russell. Whoever was in that meeting has a lot of love 
and respect for each other." 
</P>
<P>
The sounds on Sunday would indicate otherwise. It appears the emotional meeting 
could mark the beginning of the end of Gibson's successful tenure with the 
Dodgers, during which he led them to a World Series championship in 1988 as the 
National League's Most Valuable Player. 
</P>
<P>
"It would not surprise me if he is traded during the All-Star break. . . . Or I 
wouldn't be surprised if it takes until August," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
Problems may have started last winter when Gibson, rehabilitating from knee 
surgery, casually asked Claire if he would discuss a new contract. Claire 
refused, even though Gibson's contract expires at the end of this season. 
</P>
<P>
Since returning to the lineup June 2, Gibson has hit .253 with three homers and 
17 RBIs in 24 games. Although his eight-game hitting streak was broken Sunday, 
he has hit in 16 of his last 21 games at a .297 pace. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's meeting between Gibson and Claire was not their first encounter since 
the reported trade request, but it probably was their loudest. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no great resolution, but everybody had a chance to say what they 
wanted to say," Claire said of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Although Claire said he was not talking about any specific players -- or even 
Dodgers -- he then criticized players who complain about their situations. 
</P>
<P>
"We're using the wrong players for examples," he said. "We are looking to the 
wrong guys for admiration. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of everybody writing about some guy who is hitting .330, people should 
write about a guy like Juan Samuel, who goes out and does his job and doesn't 
make excuses and doesn't pop off. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't going to turn this team around unless everyone stops looking for 
excuses and looking to blame somebody, and instead looks in the mirror. I'll 
take the blame for my part in our problems. . . . I wish everyone else would 
also look in the mirror." 
</P>
<P>
Claire's mention of Samuel was interesting considering Sunday's game ended with 
Samuel standing near second base after running on a one-out fly to left field 
by Alfredo Griffin. The ball was caught by Barry Bonds, but Samuel made no 
attempt to return to first base to avoid the double play. Bonds' throw to Sid 
Bream was high and off the base, but Bream had the rest of the afternoon to 
grab the ball and touch the base and end the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a typical way for the first half of this season to end," one Dodger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The loss, which kept the Dodgers at a season-high 12 1/2 games behind the 
Cincinnati Reds, was also typical in that another fifth starter candidate 
struggled. Terry Wells, in his second start since being recalled from triple-A 
Albuquerque, gave up seven runs -- four earned -- in four innings that were 
marred by poor fielding. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to get our act together," Lasorda said. "This losing, I can't take 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Manager Tom Lasorda canceled Tuesday's scheduled workout. The Dodgers will 
travel to Chicago Wednesday for a weekend series with the Cubs. "We've been 
playing a lot and, with a night game in Chicago Thursday, we can work out early 
there," Lasorda said. . . . Tim Belcher received a cortisone injection in his 
right shoulder Sunday, a procedure he had been considering for several weeks 
because of shoulder inflammation. Although he had a 4-2 complete-game victory 
over Pittsburgh Saturday, he said his shoulder is still not feeling 100%. He is 
scheduled to pitch Saturday in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers are considering beginning the season's second half with Ramon 
Martinez facing the Cubs Thursday, Fernando Valenzuela pitching Friday, Belcher 
pitching Saturday, Mike Morgan working Sunday, and No. 5 starter candidate 
Terry Wells pitching Monday in St. Louis. Wells will probably receive at least 
one more start before the Dodgers make a decision on his future. So far, they 
are viewing him as a potential relief pitcher.

PAEZ RETAINS IBF FEATHERWEIGHT TITLE WITH DRAW

<P>
Jorge Paez didn't agree with the decision. He did, however, like the result. 
</P>
<P>
Paez retained his International Boxing Federation featherweight title Sunday 
with a 12-round draw against Troy Dorsey, a fighter he beat five months ago on 
a controversial split decision. 
</P>
<P>
"If the judges don't think I'm a winner, it's not my fault," Paez said. "The 
only thing I can say is I've got my belt and I'll take it home." 
</P>
<P>
Paez bloodied Dorsey and closed his right eye, but the relentless Dorsey pulled 
out the final round on all three scorecards to salvage a draw. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third consecutive close decision for Paez, who won his last two 
title defenses by split decisions before narrowing the margin even more with 
the draw. 
</P>
<P>
"What can I say?" the Mexican champion said. "You saw the fight. I don't think 
the judges saw the fight." 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey, 125 3/4, of Dallas, won most of the early rounds and was leading on all 
the scorecards as late as the seventh round. He also thought the judges were 
seeing the wrong fight. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how he got the (draw)," Dorsey said. "He was throwing punches, but 
I was throwing punches and I had him on the ropes." 
</P>
<P>
Paez, 126, making the eighth defense of his IBF 126-pound title in 23 months, 
said the fight may be his last at that weight. 
</P>
<P>
Paez appeared stronger than the challenger and landed the more effective 
punches, but Dorsey threw far more punches in an all-out assault for 12 rounds. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Dalby Shirley agreed with Dorsey, scoring the fight in his favor, 
116-112. Judge Jerry Roth had Paez winning, 115-113. Judge Keith Macdonald saw 
it 114-114. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press had Paez ahead, 118-110. 
</P>
<P>
Paez (35-2-3) earned $110,000 for the bout, which drew 4,421 to the Las Vegas 
Hilton. Dorsey (11-3-3) was paid $50,000.

Underdog Aaron Davis knocked Mark Breland down in the third round, then put him 
away with a short right in the ninth to take the World Boxing Assn. 
welterweight title Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, whose vision was hampered by a badly swollen right eye during most of 
the fight, staggered Breland several times with his left hand but missed with 
his right until the final blow late in the ninth round. 
</P>
<P>
"I was hurting him with the left hook, but each time I threw the right, it just 
sort of missed," Davis said. "In the ninth, I just went boom-boom." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, 30-0 with 18 knockouts, said he was afraid the fight would be stopped 
because of his swollen eye. Ring doctor James McLennan examined the eye after 
each round but allowed the bout to continue. 
</P>
<P>
"I just kept saying, 'Please don't stop the fight,' " Davis said. "I knew I 
could beat Mark." 
</P>
<P>
Breland, a 1984 Olympic gold medalist, was an 8-1 favorite to retain his title. 
He lay still in the ring for several minutes after the knockout and was taken 
to St. Mary's Hospital for examination. 
</P>
<P>
McLennan said he ordered Breland hospitalized as a precaution after the fighter 
received "a good concussion." 
</P>
<P>
Judge Patricia Jarman had Davis ahead, 77-74, going into the ninth, and judge 
Doug Tucker had him leading, 76-75. Judge Larry Rozadilla had it 77-74 for 
Breland, whose record is 27-2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he would like to fight World Boxing Council champion Marlon 
Starling. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't wait to fight again just as soon as this eye goes down," he said. 
Davis wore dark glasses to a postfight news conference. 
</P>
<P>
He said the eye began giving him problems in the first round after Breland 
caught him with a left jab, then hit him with an elbow. Davis said Breland 
continued the jab-elbow combination throughout the fight. 
</P>
<P>
Breland seemed shaken by the first blow of the fight, a short left jab by 
Davis, and was knocked to the canvas in the closing moments of the third by 
another left-right combination. 
</P>
<P>
"I hurt a lot of people with jabs," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was stunned in the eighth by a Breland right but shook it off. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him he's got to come up with more than that because I don't want to go 
back to New York a loser," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, of the Bronx, had said he would win on a knockout. 
</P>
<P>
Breland, of Brooklyn, had not predicted a knockout but said he was prepared if 
the fight went the full 12 rounds.

AXEL BECOMES TUMBLE FOR HARDING ON ICE;

FESTIVAL: AMBITIOUS PROGRAM ENDS IN DISASTER, AS DOES HER BID TO UNSEAT TRENARY 
AS NO. 1.

As she skated off the ice Sunday at the end of her Olympic Festival routine, 
Tonya Harding paused to pick up a flower that a fan had tossed in her 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
In a symbolic twist, it had fallen out of its wrapper. The routine had 
unraveled much the same way. 
</P>
<P>
Harding's free-skating program, which started out to the theme from the movie, 
"Batman," had several "Bash! Boom! Ka-pows!" But not by design. 
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old skater from Portland turned in a triple all right, just not the 
kind she was hoping for. 
</P>
<P>
On an afternoon when she attempted to become the first American woman to 
complete a triple Axel in competition, Harding ended up doing a triple tumble 
on the Met Center ice. 
</P>
<P>
It was not the kind of hat trick the sellout crowd of 13,973 was used to 
witnessing. 
</P>
<P>
Harding recovered from the spills well enough to finish second behind Nancy 
Kerrigan. But what about that challenge to Jill Trenary's reign as the top U.S. 
women's skater? 
</P>
<P>
Never mind. 
</P>
<P>
Just nine months ago, Trenary's perch at the top appeared to be tenuous. At 
last October's Skate America competition in Indianapolis, Harding defeated 
Trenary, who was then a two-time national champion and a fourth-place finisher 
in the 1988 Olympics in Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
There were many who thought Harding would make it official in February by 
taking away Trenary's U.S. crown when the two met again in the National 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
But a week before the competition, Harding contracted an illness that 
eventually developed into pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors urged her to pull out of the event, but Harding refused. 
</P>
<P>
"I would never have known where I would have come out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
As it was, Trenary won her third title easily, and Harding was a distant 
seventh. And in March, Trenary won in the World championships at Halifax, 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Both women skated at the festival, but only Harding competed. 
</P>
<P>
Trenary, whose next competition will be in four weeks at the Goodwill Games in 
Seattle, put on an exhibition Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Harding watched. And plotted. 
</P>
<P>
She has quit school and quit her job -- "in the hardware department at Sears" 
-- to concentrate on a return engagement in the nationals next February on the 
same ice where she left skid marks Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now I feel that skating is my life and it's all I have," Harding said. 
</P>
<P>
By the time she next meets Trenary in competition, Harding expects to have 
accomplished her first triple Axel, an exercise she routinely completes during 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
Midori Ito is the only woman to complete the move in competition. 
</P>
<P>
A November event on Ito's own turf, in Japan, just might be the place for 
Harding to attempt it again. And when that triple is tried, it may be preceded 
by a quadruple toe loop, a move never accomplished by a woman in competition. 
</P>
<P>
For now, Harding says she will work to perfect the routine she has -- one she 
has practiced in its entirety for less than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now it's hard because I still have to concentrate on what I'm supposed 
to do instead of just having it come naturally," Harding said. "But I know it's 
a good program for me. I picked the music out myself, and when I'm on, I skate 
great to it." 
</P>
<P>
Harding's first fall Sunday, on the attempted triple Axel, came near the 
completion of the first of her routine's three parts. 
</P>
<P>
The second portion was to the song, "Send in the Clowns". Smokey Robinson's 
"Tears of a Clown" would have been more appropriate. She fell again while 
trying a triple flip. 
</P>
<P>
And the last song? 
</P>
<P>
Fittingly, it was "Wild Thing" by Tone Loc, in which she stumbled again during 
a triple salchow. 
</P>
<P>
Kerrigan, the gold-medal winner from Stoneham, Mass., turned in precisely the 
kind of performance she needed to keep safe the lead she had earned during 
Saturday's short program. 
</P>
<P>
It was graceful but conservative. She wobbled after two of her four triple 
jumps but saved a fall both times by pushing herself up with a hand. 
</P>
<P>
Kerrigan was fourth in the nationals, narrowly missing an invitation to the 
World Championships. Sunday marked her first victory in a seniors' event. 
</P>
<P>
This event was also the seniors' debut of Nicole Bobeck, a 12-year-old from 
Chicago who, like Trenary, is coached by Carlo and Christa Fassi. 
</P>
<P>
Bobeck finished seventh, but she was the only skater to bring the crowd to its 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
It was a reaction that could have been caused solely by an aggressive 
succession and spins. 
</P>
<P>
But the fact that she is 4-feet-10 and weighs 70 pounds also was certainly a 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little nervous being here with Nancy Kerrigan and everybody big," said 
Bobeck, stretching her neck to reach the microphone during an interview session 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I could hear the crowd and I was really happy. It made me stronger at the 
end."

A surprised Chip Hanauer took advantage of favored Miss Budweiser's first-lap 
mishap and drove the Miss Circus Circus to victory in the Madison Regatta for 
unlimited hydroplanes at Madison, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Tom D'Eath's Miss Budweiser, winner of 13 of the previous 15 heats of 
competition this season, grabbed the lead at the start but hit a wave in the 
rough Ohio River going through the second turn and lifted off the water. 
</P>
<P>
By the time he came down, Hanauer had ducked inside for the lead and stayed in 
front for the rest of the five-lap race. 
</P>
<P>
Hanauer averaged 126.516 m.p.h. for the five laps. Despite some damage to his 
boat, D'Eath finished second at 121.028 m.p.h.

HE BLAZED THE TRAIL BACK FOR HERSHISER; 
</P>
<P>
DODGERS: TOMMY JOHN, WHO HAD SIMILAR OPERATION IN 1974, IS CONFIDENT 
RIGHT-HANDER HAS TOUGHNESS TO RETURN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When Orel Hershiser underwent reconstructive shoulder surgery on April 27, 
there were concerns that his pitching career had ended. Even Hershiser 
acknowledged that he feared for his baseball future during an emotional news 
conference a day before his operation. 
</P>
<P>
However, an expert on returning to the mound after a major operation is 
confident that Hershiser will also return. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Orel will pitch again and pitch better than before, if that's 
possible," said former Dodger pitcher Tommy John. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be fine. Of the pitchers on the Dodgers I know, if anybody had to have 
an injury like that, he would be the one who could come back from it because of 
his toughness." 
</P>
<P>
John's optimism is based in part on the fact that two of those who were 
instrumental in his comeback are now helping Hershiser. 
</P>
<P>
"When I heard he was going to be operated on, I thought two good things," said 
John, who was in Los Angeles last weekend for the Dodger old-timers' 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
"He's in L.A. where (Dr.) Frank Jobe is and has good medical people with the 
ballclub. (Dodger trainer) Bill Buhler worked with me every day." 
</P>
<P>
John was the Hershiser of 1974. On July 17, his 13 victories topped the 
National League. But in a game against the Montreal Expos, he suffered a 
ruptured medial collateral ligament in his left (pitching) elbow. On Sept. 25, 
in an operation never before performed before on a pitcher, Jobe transplanted a 
seven-inch strip of tendon from John's right arm to his left. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have been apprehensive if he would have said, 'We're going to do a 
surgery on you that's never been done before, but I know I can do it,' " John 
said. "But he never said that. He said, 'We're going to do surgery on you 
that's never been done before, and I don't know what to expect.' He said, 'I 
want as many good people in that operating room that I can have with me to give 
me guidance and counsel.' 
</P>
<P>
"When he said that, it indicated right there he was merely a human being who 
was going to give it his best effort. I knew right then I had chosen the right 
doctor." 
</P>
<P>
The injury sidelined John until the start of the 1976 season. When he returned, 
John -- who never had won more than 16 games in a season -- became a 20-game 
winner in 1977 as the Dodgers won the National League pennant. He won another 
17 games in 1978, helping the Dodgers repeat as National League champions. 
</P>
<P>
John's success continued when he signed as a free agent with the New York 
Yankees after the 1978 season; he won 21 games in 1979 and 22 in 1980. In all, 
John won 174 games after his operation for a total of 284 in a career that 
ended when he was released by the Yankees May 29, 1989, a week after his 46th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser enjoys several advantages John did not have. The operation Hershiser 
underwent, a reconstruction of a torn anterior labrum and anterior capsule (a 
structure that keeps the shoulder stable) had been performed on other pitchers. 
Magnetic Resonance Image examinations allow better diagnosis of injuries while 
rehabilitation techniques have advanced since the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't know what to expect in my case," John said. "I was in a cast or 
splints for 16 weeks. Now guys are in and out real fast and start doing therapy 
as son as feasible. Back then, they weren't real sure of the exercises they do 
now." 
</P>
<P>
To John, the key to a Hershiser comeback is patience. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest thing that I see guys do wrong is they put a time schedule on 
their recovery," John said. "A timetable is like trying to sell a house by a 
certain date. Maybe the only way you can sell your house by then is to put it 
too low." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser is heeding that advice. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole rehab process in based on patience," Hershiser told Times columnist 
Allan Malamud last month. "What would ruin the patience is a timetable." 
</P>
<P>
Hershiser's rehabilitation consists of exercises involving free weights 
designed to increase range of motion and strength in the shoulder. Hershiser 
spends at least an hour to 90 minutes on the program each day. 
</P>
<P>
"We're real pleased with his progress," Buhler said. "The goals are being met 
and surpassed. The range of motion has been remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem is try to hold him in. He feels so good and thinks 
everything has healed, but there hasn't been enough time." 
</P>
<P>
"There is a fine line between how hard to work and how hard not to work, where 
you push it past the point where you get a setback," John said. "With Orel's 
competitiveness, that's what he has to work at. Work hard, but don't work past 
that point. The hardest thing is when you come back throwing all out knowing 
you won't reinjure. Once you can overcome that special barrier, then you're 
fine."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
METS' VIOLA AS HOT AS WEATHER IN ATLANTA 
</P>

<P>
Darryl Strawberry is hitting moonshots, and Mackey Sasser is wielding a 
powerful bat, but the New York Mets are the hottest team in the major leagues 
because of their pitching. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Viola is the bellwether of the staff that is largely responsible for the 
Mets winning 17 of their last 19 games and 26 of their last 31. 
</P>
<P>
Viola, with late-inning help from John Franco, became the National League's 
first 13-game winner Sunday when the Mets edged the Braves, 2-1, at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Pitching in 100-degree weather, Viola gave up seven hits in 7 2/3 innings. 
Franco got the last four outs -- although he walked two in the ninth inning -- 
for his 17th save. Viola, who probably will not pitch in Tuesday's All-Star 
game because he pitched Sunday, has a 13-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
The left-hander, obtained last July 31 in a trade with Minnesota, was the Mets' 
pitching staff early in the season. When the club was a struggling 16-14, Viola 
was 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really too hot to pitch," Viola said. "All I could do was go out there 
and throw hard for as long as I could. I was tired and just hoping to make it 
through eight so John (Franco) would only have to go one. But I couldn't make 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Strawberry's two-out double in the first inning produced one run for the Mets, 
and Sasser's single set up the other run in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 5, Montreal 3 -- Pinch-hitter Terry Puhl hit a two-out, two-run double 
off Dennis Martinez in the seventh inning, and the Astros finally won another 
road game. 
</P>
<P>
The Astros had lost seven in a row and 20 of their last 21 away from the 
Astrodome. They were trailing Martinez (6-7) until the hit by Puhl brought them 
from behind. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't enjoy facing Dennis in that situation," Puhl said. "He has one of the 
best curves in the game. I just went up there swinging and connected." 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 4, San Diego 1 -- Bob Tewksbury (4-1) gave up three hits in 8 1/3 
innings at San Diego, and Willie McGee, the No. 5 hitter in the league in 
batting average at .320, had two hits and drove in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Tewksbury has given up only one earned run in his last three starts, covering 
23 1/3 innings. McGee was eight for 16 in the four-game series. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco 5-10, Chicago 3-4 -- Kevin Mitchell ended a five-for-33 slump 
with home runs in each game at San Francisco to help the Giants cut the Reds' 
lead in the West to eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell hit a two-run home run in the first inning of the opener and was five 
for eight for the day. He has 21 home runs, 50 RBIs and a .312 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants' two young pitchers, Trevor Wilson (6-0) and John Burkett (9-2), 
earned the victories. Wilson went 5 2/3 innings in the first game, and Burkett 
went seven in the second. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 4, Cincinnati 3 -- John Kruk drove in the tying and winning runs 
with singles at Philadelphia and the Phillies avoided a four-game sweep. 
</P>
<P>
Kruk's two-out single in the seventh inning off Norm Charlton (6-3) scored 
Randy Ready from third base with the tiebreaking run. DAN HAFNER

JOHN STILL LOVES THE GAME, BUT HIS FAMILY COMES FIRST

<P>
In his first full season away from professional baseball, Tommy John has become 
a self-described full-time father and husband. This spring he and his wife, 
Sally, managed a New Jersey Little League team that sons Travis and Tommy 
played for. 
</P>
<P>
John has also made motivational speeches to corporate groups and served as a 
sports consultant to a New York City hotel. However, he would like to return to 
major league baseball in some capacity. 
</P>
<P>
"The Dodgers have approached me on a couple of minor league assignments, but I 
have to put my family first," said John, who pitched for six teams, including 
the Dodgers and the Angels during a 26-year major league career. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking into doing television baseball work, but only 30 to 40 games a 
season, so I would have a chance to talk about the game I love and know a lot 
about, and yet still have a family life. That's more important than anything."

DODGERS: ROOKIE PITCHER GIVES UP THREE UNEARNED RUNS IN FIRST INNING OF SECOND 
MAJOR LEAGUE START.

With the Dodgers' pitching as troubled as it has been this year, Terry Wells' 
arrival in the big leagues was greeted with little fanfare and much optimism. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was it hoped that Wells would give the Dodgers the fifth starter they 
so badly need, but it brought them another left-hander in their rotation -- a 
highly valued commodity in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Wells got his second major league start, drawing the loss, 7-2, against 
the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
He pitched four innings, gave up seven runs (four earned), two walks and eight 
hits, and struck out seven. 
</P>
<P>
But of the eight hits, only Jay Bell's liner up the middle in the first inning 
was solid. "His control has been much better than his record shows," Dodger 
pitching coach Ron Perranoski said. "He still needs to get a breaking ball and 
off-speed pitch over, but it's tough to come up here and get everything 
together all at once." 
</P>
<P>
Wells was obtained on April 1, when the Dodgers swapped Franklin Stubbs to the 
Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
Wells, 27, made his major league debut last Tuesday against Chicago, a 
no-decison when the Dodgers came from behind to win, 7-6. Wells pitched 
six-plus innings, giving up six runs (four earned) on eight hits, including two 
doubles and two home runs. 
</P>
<P>
He had been called up the day before from Albuquerque, where he was 7-3 with a 
4.10 earned-run average in 17 games. In his last three starts for Alburguerque, 
he went 3-0 with a 2.21 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say what our plans are for him, and I can't say he's our fifth guy," 
said Perranoski. "He's only been here two games. But this is his shot, it's 
what he makes of it." 
</P>
<P>
Wells used breaking balls and a few changeups to set up his fastball, which 
could be ominous. 
</P>
<P>
But his statistics question his promise. 
</P>
<P>
The three runs he gave up in the first inning provide an example. 
</P>
<P>
Wells started the game by striking out Gary Redus, then gave up Bell's single. 
</P>
<P>
With Bell at first, R.J. Reynolds hit a double-play grounder to shortstop 
Alfredo Griffin, who botched the throw to second, allowing both runners to 
reach base. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Bonilla flied out to right field, then Wells gave up singles to Barry 
Bonds, Jeff King and Jose Lind before striking out Dann Bilardello to end the 
inning. Three unearned runs had scored, and the Dodgers were already playing 
catch up in the bottom of the first. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd have been out of the inning if they wouldn't have scored the three runs. 
They didn't support him," said Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda. "Had they not 
scored, it could have been a different ball game. But he had to pitch from 
behind." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Wells took full responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"Those things (errors) happen. It's part of the game. The defenders didn't give 
up all the hits," Wells said. "I had a little bit better stuff than the last 
time, but we still lost the game and you can't do much about that. 
</P>
<P>
"I threw a few changeups and some fork(balls) and breaking balls, but I was 
missing. For a while, I was pretty wild and I wasn't ahead (in the count) and I 
got less effective." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the opposition was impressed. 
</P>
<P>
"His fastball keeps you honest," Reynolds said. "He just needs to work on his 
mix. But it's hard to learn all that in the big leagues."

PATCHES WINS, DOUBLES STEVENS' PLEASURE

<P>
Gary Stevens was on a double high going into Sunday's $163,600 Hollywood Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old jockey, trying to win the national money title that eluded him 
by less than $30,000 in 1986, found out that trainer Wayne Lukas had named him 
to ride Criminal Type in the $1-million Arlington Challenge Cup on Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Santos won't be able to ride Criminal Type that day because he will be 
required to serve a five-day New York suspension that has been in abeyance 
since last year. Criminal Type's opposition is expected to include Sunday 
Silence and Easy Goer. 
</P>
<P>
And Stevens had the ride on Patches, another Lukas runner, in the Oaks. Stevens 
had ridden Patches as well as Jefforee and A Wild Ride, whom Lukas was also 
running in the 1 1/8-mile stake. 
</P>
<P>
Patches sped past Golden Reef to take the lead approaching the far turn, got a 
breather on the turn itself and then had barely enough left to beat Jefforee by 
a head. Patches earned $96,100 for her owner and breeder, William T. Young of 
Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Jefforee, running for the sixth time in less than two months, finished four 
lengths ahead of Pampered Star in the field of eight, and it was 3 1/2 lengths 
farther back to Let Fly, a 51-1 shot. 
</P>
<P>
The other Lukas entrant, A Wild Ride, finished fifth, and the John Mabee-owned 
entry of Annual Reunion and Fields of Gold, sent off as the 2-1 favorite by the 
crowd of 22,105, ran sixth and seventh, respectively. Golden Reef finished 
last. 
</P>
<P>
Because she had a different owner than the Calumet Farm duo of Jefforee and A 
Wild Ride, Patches was separated in the betting and paid $7.60 to win as the 
second choice. Her winning time was 1:49 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens has liked Patches since he won a couple of allowance races with the 
Majestic Light-Miss Betty filly during an eight-day stretch at Santa Anita 
early this year. 
</P>
<P>
Patches was sent to Churchill Downs after that for a small stake a couple of 
days before the Kentucky Derby. Patches was 1-9 when she dumped Stevens in the 
post parade, ran off and had to be scratched by the stewards. 
</P>
<P>
"That would have been one of the easiest races I ever had to win," Stevens 
said. "What happened was that the pony boy dropped his reins, and the strap hit 
my filly in the head." 
</P>
<P>
Startled, Patches dropped Stevens, banged into the fence and took off. "I had a 
couple of sore legs, and it could have been worse than that," Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
"When she stepped on me, she just missed my face by a couple of inches, and 
there's no telling how serious it could have been if she had hit me. 
</P>
<P>
"Craig Perret, who was on another horse right behind us, saw it all and told me 
how close she'd come." 
</P>
<P>
Patches ran at Churchill Downs about a week later, with Keith Allen, a local 
rider, and won a minor stake, but when she returned to Hollywood Park, the 
filly was ridden by Pat Valenzuela twice and finished second in the Railbird 
June 9 and third in the Princess June 24. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas said that Stevens didn't have any choice when he rode Hail Atlantis, 
another of the trainer's top fillies, in the Princess. 
</P>
<P>
"I had won the Santa Anita Oaks with Hail Atlantis, so I owed it to the owners 
to ride her," Stevens said of the filly's far-back finish in the Princess. 
</P>
<P>
Lukas says that Stevens and Patches make a good team. "He really seems to fit 
her, and he was really anxious to get back on her," the trainer said. 
</P>
<P>
"He came up to me right after that last race and requested to get on her." 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye, who won the Oaks last year with Gorgeous, sent Golden Reef, 
the second-place finisher in the Princess behind A Wild Ride, to the lead 
Sunday, but she ran a slow opening half-mile in 47 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens had Patches on the fence, in second place. "Eddie's filly was lugging 
out all the way down the backside, so I decided to go on with mine," Stevens 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a winning move, because then she got some rest coming around the 
turn. She needed that, because I don't think she could have run any farther, 
she was (tiring) at the end. With about 100 yards to go, I could hear Jefforee 
coming, and we had just enough left to hold her off." 
</P>
<P>
Lukas, whose strength through the years has been fillies, had come close but 
never won the Oaks, one of the few major filly races to escape him. Since 
running last about a year ago at Hollywood Park in her first race, Patches has 
five victories, one second and two thirds in eight starts. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa, who carries more weight than the country's top male horses, has been 
assigned 128 pounds, the heaviest impost of her career, for next Sunday's 
$200,000 Vanity Handicap at Hollywood Park. Next on the list is Gorgeous at 124 
pounds, and then there's a drop to Beautiful Melody at 116 and Fantastic Look 
at 112. . . . Trainer Bill Shoemaker saddled his second winner in as many days, 
and third overall, when Profit System, a filly making her first start, won the 
third race. 
</P>
<P>
In another race Sunday, Stone God, a $60,000 auction buy, beat 2-year-old colts 
as Warfield, a $700,000 purchase, ran last. . . . Elusive Road, winner of the 
seventh race, was claimed for the fourth time in his last eight races. . . . On 
Saturday, Gin Rummy Judy won the seventh race from the seventh post position on 
the seventh day of the seventh month. The 4-year-old filly is owned by the 
Seven Star Stable. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens has reached the $7-million mark in purses and leads Jose Santos by 
about $900,000. . . . Don Alexander, who started the season as the track 
announcer at Hollywood Park, is now calling the races at a small track near San 
Antonio, Tex. . . . A total of $48,960 was raised for the Don MacBeth Memorial 
Jockey Fund Saturday at Hollywood, where many jockeys gave up their mount fees. 
The fund is used to aid disabled riders.

MAXICARE'S STAY IN CHAPTER 11 IS ALMOST OVER; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH CARE: THE MEDICAL SERVICES PROVIDER MAY CLEAR ITS LAST HURDLE IN COURT 
TODAY. ALTHOUGH IT'S COME A LONG WAY IN 15 MONTHS, ITS FUTURE IS IN DOUBT. 
</P>

<P>
Maxicare Health Plans is to appear before a federal judge in Santa Ana today to 
complete the final hurdle before emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
However, once outside the shelter of the U. S. Bankruptcy Court, the Los 
Angeles-based health maintenance organization's survival as an independent 
company is in doubt. And even if Maxicare can remain independent, industry 
analysts say there are major questions about its ability to compete in an 
environment where purchasers of health care -- primarily employers who provide 
benefits for workers -- are demanding much more of the so-called managed 
health-care companies. 
</P>
<P>
It is remarkable that Maxicare has come so far so soon after filing for Chapter 
11 relief in March, 1989. Maxicare -- with relative ease -- got the 
court-appointed creditors' committees to endorse a reorganization that would 
distribute a combination of cash, bonds and stock to creditors to pay claims. 
The votes of individual creditors are expected to be announced today, as the 
court opens a hearing on whether to confirm the reorganization plan. 
</P>
<P>
Upon court approval, Maxicare would convert existing bonds and stock into new 
issues for the reorganized company. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers think that Maxicare will be vulnerable when it emerges from 
bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
"My sense is that someone is going to take them over," said Larry Selwitz, an 
analyst with the investment banking firm of Cruttenden &amp; Co. in Newport 
Beach.Selwitz noted that the reorganization plan will place about 49% of the 
stock of the new Maxicare in the hands of doctors and hospitals who serve 
Maxicare members. 
</P>
<P>
Most public HMOs, like Maxicare, provide medical care through contracts with 
independent hospitals, clinics and doctors, Selwitz noted. And the healthier 
ones tend to have cash for acquisitions because they don't have to invest in 
hospitals, equipment and medical staff, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Selwitz thinks that few of the doctors and hospitals will be able to 
resist a decent cash offer for their stock, especially when it would not be 
inconvenient for them to deal with a new owner. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the medical groups that have contracts with Maxicare also have 
contracts with other HMOs, he said, including Cypress-based PacifiCare Health 
Systems, which in April proposed to buy Maxicare. When selling to an HMO like 
PacifiCare becomes merely a matter of "changing names on a file," he added, the 
attitude of many providers will be: "Why fool around with Maxicare?" 
</P>
<P>
Managers of PacifiCare and Maxicare talked, but the bid died abruptly. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Street, managing director of Seidler Amdec Securities' group, which 
specializes in bankruptcy stocks and bonds, said he hopes Maxicare will remain 
independent. But he conceded that the new stock will trade at a low price 
compared to other public HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it's going to be cheap. It would be a very inexpensive deal for 
someone to take them over," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Street said, "I'm personally not in favor of selling out. The company is 
going to be worth a heck of a lot more in 12 months." 
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that Maxicare's membership will grow because the new 
physician owners will steer more of their patients to the HMO. Also, Street 
said, he believes that corporate employee benefit managers will behave "much 
more kindly" toward Maxicare when it emerges from the Chapter 11 proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Maxicare has the highest name recognition of any HMO other than 
Kaiser. It will be a very well-capitalized company that has a strong provider 
network," he added. The company will grow, he said, and the "real loser will be 
PacifiCare . . . which is why it wants to buy Maxicare." 
</P>
<P>
Since the court filing, Maxicare's membership has declined more than 50% in the 
divisions it plans to keep. Membership as of March 31 was about 320,000. 
</P>
<P>
However, Street's is an optimistic view. Berkeley-based health-care consultant 
Peter Boland thinks that Maxicare may have trouble persuading employers to keep 
offering its plan. And it is employers -- not doctors -- who really control HMO 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
Many companies are reducing by "at least 50%" the number of HMOs they allow 
employees to choose from, Boland said. "They will limit the HMO choice to 
possibly one or two. . . . It's probable that the companies that offer Kaiser 
will continue to do so. If there is going to be another HMO option, it is 
likely to be a point-of-service HMO." 
</P>
<P>
Point-of-service plans allow members to make a decision based on each medical 
need about whether to seek service from the network's medical providers or go 
outside the network and pay more. 
</P>
<P>
"Those employers who continue to offer Maxicare will be under a fair amount of 
pressure to offer a plan that is broader and more diverse," Boland said. "It's 
an uphill struggle for Maxicare to be seen as a credible competitor on an equal 
footing with others," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare officials declined to be interviewed before the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
In the disclosure statement on the proposed reorganization, Maxicare's managers 
are optimistic about its future as a smaller company operating in only a 
handful of states. Management projects that Maxicare will earn about $7.5 
million in 1990 and boost its earnings to $32.8 million in 1994. The 
projections are based on "reasonable assumptions" but may not be realized in 
light of uncertainties about inflation and increases in medical cost, the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare filed for Chapter 11 after it was squeezed by high interest costs 
resulting from an acquisition binge in 1986 that made it the nation's largest 
publicly traded HMO. The acquisitions saddled it with a number of unprofitable 
plans with high overhead. The company, deeply in the red, was also facing 
pressure from state regulators and creditors. 
</P>
<P>
To help improve its bottom line, Maxicare sold, or closed, several plans, 
pulling completely out of most states. Nearly half the current membership is in 
California, where Maxicare competes with several HMOs. They include Kaiser and 
PacifiCare, plus new HMOs and preferred provider organizations created by 
indemnity insurers such as Travelers Corp. and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Although some Maxicare members complained that doctors and hospitals harassed 
them for payment of debts that Maxicare owed after the Chapter 11 bankruptcy, 
Maxicare boasts that its members suffered no interruption of service during the 
reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MAXICARE: THEN AND NOW 
</P>
<P>
Membership at the health maintenance organization peaked at more than two 
million before heading down. At the time Maxicare filed for protection from 
creditors, membership stood at less than half that amount, and has declined to 
325,000 as of March 31, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Maxicare membership 1986-1990 
</P>
<P>
6/30/86: 822,000 
</P>
<P>
12/31/87: 2.3 million 
</P>
<P>
3/31/89: 1 million 
</P>
<P>
3/31/90: 325,000 
</P>
<P>
Toned areas indicate states where Maxicare had operations as of Dec. 31, 1987, 
a total of 26. The darker tone indicates the seven states where the reorganized 
company is operating as it emerges from Chapter 11.

General Dynamics Sued Over Vincennes: The suit was filed Monday against General 
Dynamics Inc. by 12 relatives of an Iranian couple who were among the 290 
killed when a guided missile from the USS Vincennes downed an Iranian Airbus 
over the Persian Gulf in July, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. District Court case, filed in Los Angeles, alleges El Segundo-based 
General Dynamics made and sold defective radar equipment, causing commercial 
Flight 655 to be "misidentified on the radar screen as military and hostile." 
The suit seeks at least $100 million. (Filed July 2, 1990. Case No. 90-3426)

SEC Settles With Investment Adviser: The Securities and Exchange Commission 
said Monday that it initiated administrative proceedings against Los Angeles 
investment adviser Patterson Capital Corp. and New York broker-dealer Goodrich 
Securities, but simultaneously accepted their settlement offers. 
</P>
<P>
The SEC said Patterson Capital and owner Joseph B. Patterson improperly used 
commissions from client accounts to pay for marketing services benefitting 
Patterson Capital, and defrauded clients by not telling them how the 
commissions were being used. Patterson allegedly paid for the marketing through 
Goodrich. The SEC censured Patterson and his company as well as Goodrich and 
ordered Patterson Capital to make full disclosure to its clients. (Released 
June 25, 1990. File No. 3-7349)

IBM, Motorola Discuss Chip Deal: IBM is discussing licensing the technology on 
its most advanced memory chip to Motorola Inc., the New York Times quoted 
sources as saying. Motorola wants to be less dependent on its partner Toshiba 
Corporation for semiconductor technology, the sources said. The talks, which 
neither IBM nor Motorola would confirm, are said to involve dynamic random 
access memory chips that store 4 million bits of information.

CBS, Tribune Entertainment to Pay Copyright Damages: A federal judge Thursday 
ordered CBS Inc., Tribune Entertainment Co. and Geraldo Rivera's Investigative 
News Group to pay a total of $3,000 in a copyright suit stemming from their use 
of clips of Charles Manson and his family. 
</P>
<P>
The suit was brought by movie producer Robert Hendrickson, who had sought 
$310,000 because the defendants used two minutes of footage from his 1973 
documentary "Manson." (Filed May 1, 1989. Case No. CV89-2601)

WINE SALES DOWN 5% FOR 2ND STRAIGHT YEAR

Wine consumption in the United States dropped sharply for the second straight 
year in 1989, with Mississippians drinking the least and tipplers in the 
District of Columbia the most, a trade publication reported. 
</P>
<P>
Drinkers in California, New York and Washington, the top wine-producing states, 
drank the most per capita, but New Hampshire was the only state to show a gain 
in consumption over 1988, according to Wines &amp; Vines. 
</P>
<P>
Americans last year drank 2.11 gallons of wine per capita, the lowest 
consumption of any major wine-producing nation and a 5.8% drop from 1988. 
Consumption in 1988 was off 5% from 1987. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, Americans over 21 drank 33.7 gallons of beer, 2.16 gallons of 
distilled spirits and about 35 gallons of coffee. Adult-only wine consumption 
was 3.03 gallons per capita. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting a national trend against alcohol consumption, individual states 
posted figures showing as much as a 19.5% drop from 1988. In Arizona, a 
half-gallon less wine per capita was consumed last year than in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The domestic wine market, including imports, fell 5.2% to 523 million gallons. 
It was a 64.1-million-gallon drop from a high point of 587.1 million gallons in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
California wines accounted for 72.8% of consumption, while the other 42 
wine-producing states held 12.6% of the market. The rest of the market, 14.6%, 
was imports. 
</P>
<P>
Wines &amp; Vines blamed the market drop on a continuing falloff in generic or 
jug wines, nearly all of it produced in California's San Joaquin Valley, and a 
16.7% dip in wine cooler sales. 
</P>
<P>
Blush varietals such as white zinfandel and white grenache continued to gain 
market share, while premiums, which cost more than $3 a bottle, increased 7%.

DEALS: MARKET WATCH; 
</P>
<P>
THIS UNLIKELY AIRPLANE DEAL COULD REALLY FLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
You would think that an airplane leasing company that calls itself 
International Lease Finance Corp. would make its money by leasing airplanes to 
customers. But you would be wrong. International Lease makes most of its money 
not by leasing airplanes but by selling them. 
</P>
<P>
Combine that wonderful fact with the fact that changing just one number can 
send International Lease's reported profits rocketing up to the stratosphere, 
and you begin to see why American International Group, the huge insurance 
holding company, has the hots for International Lease. 
</P>
<P>
AIG is forking over more than $3 billion -- $1.3 billion to International 
Lease's stockholders and assuming $1.9 billion of debt -- to get into the 
airplane game. But airplanes, if you can forgive the pun, are notorious for 
being an up-and-down business. And the down part of the cycle seems to be 
starting. Prices of some used airplanes are starting to slide. Some U.S. 
airlines are starting to weaken. 
</P>
<P>
And if the deal goes through, AIG will be on the hook not only for the $3.2 
billion it's spending to buy International Lease but also for $15 billion or so 
worth of planes that International Lease has committed to buy over the next 10 
years. Committing billions to the airplane business in this market makes about 
as much sense as buying a lifetime pass on Frank Lorenzo's airlines. Unless, of 
course, you're very clever -- and AIG is nothing if not clever. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the answer to why AIG is buying International Lease, of course, is that 
AIG thinks the airplane market will be so strong in the next few years that it 
will make a fortune because International Lease, the world's second-largest 
plane leasing company, ordered its planes at cheap prices. 
</P>
<P>
Another part of the answer, which emerges only when you massage some numbers, 
is that AIG is an almost sure bet to have higher earnings with International 
Lease than without it. How? By changing the way that International Lease 
charges its earnings for depreciation on its planes. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how it works. A company like International Lease has to charge its 
earnings for the fact that its planes get closer to the end of their useful 
lives with every passing year. You've heard of this before -- it's 
depreciation. It's what happens to your car as you get more miles on the 
odometer. 
</P>
<P>
Airplanes can become old rust-buckets, too, but companies can't just put a 
bumper sticker and a piece of fiberglass over the holes; they have to account 
for it on their financial statements. Say International Lease spends $100 
million for a plane. It charges its profits $4.5 million a year for 
depreciation and decreases the plane's value on its balance sheet by that 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
International Lease makes its profit when it comes time to sell the plane; the 
profit is the difference between the depreciated value of the aircraft and the 
price for which it's finally sold. International Lease makes big money on sales 
-- which means that its depreciation charges have been higher than they had to 
be. In 1988, for instance, International Lease made $36 million (before income 
taxes) by selling planes, compared to $20 million for leasing them. In 1989, 
$53 million versus $20 million. In the first quarter of 1990, $14.9 million 
versus a loss of $7 million, compared to $2.5 million versus a loss of $10.1 
million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
So AIG could cut the depreciation charges and give International Lease's 
earnings a real boost. The company would report smaller profits on sales of 
planes, but who cares? AIG's reported profits from "financial services" would 
be up, and everyone would be happy. 
</P>
<P>
AIG Vice Chairman Edward Matthews says that changing the depreciation numbers 
"is under active consideration," but he wouldn't be drawn into a discussion 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
Say International Lease depreciated planes the way the world's biggest airplane 
lessor, GPA Group, does. If you take that difference and apply it to the 
$10-billion fleet that International Lease will soon have, reported earnings 
increase $90 million a year at one stroke. That's a much easier way of making 
money than actually earning it. And $90 million a year is about what 
International Lease's whole operation earns now. 
</P>
<P>
If the deal takes place, it should be fun to watch. The companies couldn't be 
more different. Not only are they on opposite coasts -- AIG in New York City, 
International Lease in Beverly Hills -- but AIG's 27-person tax department is 
almost as large as all of International Lease, which has just added its 28th 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
AIG, as an insurance company, likes to eliminate risk. International Lease 
relishes it. The company simultaneously juggles currencies, interest rates, 
projected airline prices in the 21st Century and the financial outlook for 
foreign airlines so obscure that few Americans can pronounce their names, let 
alone figure them out. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is "synergy." AIG talks about using its group of trading whizzes to 
hedge International Lease's interest rate risk. International Lease talks about 
some incomprehensible plan to do something with planes in Indonesia to take 
advantage of Indonesian tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
It all sounds wonderful -- but then again, it always does. Whether this deal 
makes economic sense for AIG won't be clear for several years. But AIG's 
ability to play games with depreciation means that the deal will make earnings 
sense. These days, you take what you can get.

MARKET BEAT: MARKET WATCH;

<P>
NOW, THE CALIFORNIA 300 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the 1980s, the California economy grew 50% faster than that of the other 49 
states combined. With that kind of growth, you'd think the stocks of companies 
based here would have performed far better than the market, on average. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the opposite was true, at least from 1985 to 1989: An index of the 300 
largest California companies, based on stock market capitalization, 
consistently under-performed the national Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index 
in that period. 
</P>
<P>
But in the first half of this year, the California 300 was neck-and-neck with 
the S&amp;P 500. And some experts believe that the 1990s are going to favor 
stocks of California-style growth companies at the expense of the S&amp;P 500 
behemoths. 
</P>
<P>
The California 300 index is a recent creation of Associated Capital Investors, 
a San Francisco money manager that runs more than $3 billion. Associated's CEO, 
Thomas Kelley, said the firm decided to launch the California 300 because no 
other benchmark existed to track stocks of firms based in the state, which has 
now become the sixth-largest economy in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The index was given a value of 1,000 as of Feb. 28. Last week, the index stood 
at about 1,030. The 300 companies in the index range from Chevron Corp. and 
Walt Disney Co. to Barry's Jewelers and Earl Scheib Inc. 
</P>
<P>
The California 300's sub-par performance in the late 1980s stemmed from its 
heavy weighting in oil and technology -- both terrible investment areas in 
those years, Kelley said. Also, "growth" stock investing in general took a back 
seat to takeover mania and asset-value stock plays. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Kelley believes that in the early 1990s, the smaller growth stocks that 
are a major part of the California 300 "are going to come back and have their 
day in the sun." The move into those types of stocks may have begun with the 
surge in technology stocks in the first half of this year, some experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, no professional money manager would invest solely in 
California-based stocks. But if the California 300 begins to outperform the 
S&amp;P 500, it's bound to be good publicity on Wall Street for California's 
hottest growth stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Associated Capital's average portfolio posted a 4.2% gain in the first half, 
Kelley said, helped by stellar gains in a number of California-based tech 
companies. David Turnbough, Associated's senior vice president, said the list 
of the firm's favorite young tech companies now includes Irvine-based AST 
Research ($24.25 Friday), a major personal computer maker; Sausalito-based 
Autodesk ($54.50), which makes software for computer-aided design and drafting 
functions, and San Jose-based Xilinx Inc. ($15), which makes a new type of 
computer chip that can be programmed by the user for specific applications.

<P>
Earnings Guessing Game: Earnings of the S&amp;P 500 companies fell 4% last 
year, and some analysts are worried that they'll drop again this year if the 
economy remains weak. 
</P>
<P>
Does that mean stocks are bound to go lower? Maybe not. Contrary to what many 
investors might suppose, the market has almost always risen in years when 
S&amp;P 500 earnings have dropped, according to research by Pasadena money 
manager Roger Engemann &amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, for example, the S&amp;P stocks gained nearly 32% (including 
dividends), even as earnings fell. 
</P>
<P>
The simple explanation for that seeming contradiction is that the stock market 
always looks ahead -- and by the time earnings are in trouble, many investors 
are already betting on the next up-cycle. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings were weak in 1960-61, for example, yet the S&amp;P managed a 1% gain 
in 1960, then soared 27% in 1961. In the 1956-58 profit crunch, stocks dropped 
11% in 1957 but soared 43% in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
So even if second- and third-quarter earnings are disastrous this year and the 
market plunges, buyers could rush back in by the fourth quarter if they figure 
the worst is over. (Of course, we're talking averages here; individual stocks 
that post awful earnings could suffer far worse than the broad market.) 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the problem with the market's anticipatory nature is that it often 
trashes stocks temporarily when companies finally begin to show better 
earnings. In other words, when Wall Street anticipates correctly, the actual 
event becomes anti-climactic. 
</P>
<P>
Which means that stocks might run a good chance of falling this year, or next, 
if earnings do indeed rebound. A big profit rebound in 1984, for example, was 
accompanied by a mere 5% S&amp;P gain, after a 20%-plus gain in 1983. Then, as 
earnings dropped 12% in 1985, stocks soared almost 32% -- in anticipation of 
the next up- cycle. Sound convoluted? That's why a lot of investors just ignore 
the short-term swings and focus on the long haul -- because rising earnings 
will always translate into higher stock prices over time. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHEN EARNINGS DROP 
</P>
<P>
What if corporate earnings drop again this year, as they did in 1989? Here's 
how the stock market handled back-to-back earnings declines in the 1950s and 
'60s:

WHEN TAKING ON MORE DEBT IS A SMART MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There's no rest for the indebted. 
</P>
<P>
Donald J. Trump must sell assets and secure more loans before additional 
payments come due next month or the boy billionaire will add another "b" word 
to his vocabulary -- bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, of course, borrowed beyond his means -- and he is certainly not alone. 
</P>
<P>
The past five years, consumer and mortgage debt has increased 9.3% annually, 
while personal income has grown less than 5% a year. Today, the average 
American -- man, woman and child -- has borrowed nearly a full year's income. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether you are a small-time investor or a mega-investor like Donald Trump, if 
you don't use debt wisely, you end up in trouble," said Richard Martens, 
executive vice president of retail lending at Security Pacific National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Does that mean it's time to stop borrowing altogether? Not necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
Using other people's money is still a good way to get rich. The trick is 
determining when borrowing will be profitable. Credit experts say there are a 
number of rules that borrowers can follow to determine when debt makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
* Borrow when the cash generated by the investment is sufficient to cover the 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
An example is the purchase of rental property whose rents will cover expenses 
related to the property's purchase, with the exception of the down payment and 
closing costs. 
</P>
<P>
"The first rule of thumb is every property needs to have cash flow even after 
taking into consideration the mortgage, taxes, insurance, repairs and potential 
vacancies," said Richard L. Otterstrom, president of Coast Harbor Realty in 
Venice. "If you are not an experienced owner and manager, you should also 
pencil in the cost of outside management." 
</P>
<P>
Vacancy rates typically range from 5% to 10%, Otterstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
Cash flow is a product of the size of the down payment and the kind of loan 
secured. Fixed-rate loans are more predictable, but adjustable-rate loans are 
often less expensive the first few years. 
</P>
<P>
More significantly, the bigger the down payment, the better the cash flow. But, 
remember, that money is tied up in a long-term, non-interest-bearing 
investment. Consumers must weigh the benefits of generating even better cash 
flow against the loss of the use of that money. Generally, investors shouldn't 
put more down than required to create break-even monthly cash flow because 
excess cash can be better spent elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
* Borrow when money is cheap. 
</P>
<P>
In inflationary times, it makes sense to borrow because the loan will be paid 
off with cheaper, inflated dollars. In the meantime, those funds could be 
invested in higher-yielding securities. 
</P>
<P>
Even when inflation is not an issue, people can sometimes earn money by 
borrowing and investing the funds at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
"Deferred" wages are one such opportunity. Some companies allow their workers 
to lend the corporation cash by deferring part of that year's salary. To 
encourage this, the company often pays the worker an amount equivalent to its 
borrowing costs -- prime plus 1%, for example. At today's rates, that amounts 
to 11%. If the employee can borrow elsewhere at a lower rate -- possibly 
through a home equity loan -- the transaction can earn handsome rewards with 
little risk. 
</P>
<P>
* Borrow when your monthly income is sufficient to cover the debt and the money 
can be used to create greater value. 
</P>
<P>
This is, perhaps, the trickiest rule because what looks like a sure thing 
doesn't always pan out. And some people are able to justify virtually any 
expense with an argument that it will produce a potentially lucrative reward. 
</P>
<P>
It is easy to justify borrowing to buy a car when it is the only reliable form 
of transportation to get to work. But does it make sense to go into debt to buy 
an $80,000 Mercedes? Most financial advisers would say no. But there are 
exceptions. A few professionals might argue that, to be successful, they must 
have some trappings of success. 
</P>
<P>
* Borrow to build equity. 
</P>
<P>
It often makes sense to borrow to buy a first home or fix one up. First-time 
home buyers not only save money on rent, they also gain tax benefits and build 
equity. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, mortgage lenders say a house payment should not exceed 30% to 40% of 
the borrower's gross monthly income. 
</P>
<P>
Spending on remodeling can be rewarding. The rule of thumb is: Spend if 
improvements will be worth $2 -- when the home is resold -- for every $1 
invested. Home-improvement publications often list the kinds of additions and 
remodeling projects that are most likely to pay off. 
</P>
<P>
* Borrow when the money is free. 
</P>
<P>
You're in a department store about to make a purchase. Do you write a check 
from your interest-bearing checking account, or borrow by putting the purchase 
on a store credit card? 
</P>
<P>
If the store allows a grace period for payments, borrowing makes sense because 
the debt is free. Also, stores often have promotions where they'll extend the 
grace period. 
</P>
<P>
Earnings on the "float" are small, of course. 
</P>
<P>
The debt should be paid before the grace period expires, however, because most 
department stores charge upward of 19% for credit. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't borrow when monthly payments exceed your ability to pay with your 
monthly salary, without overtime. When you need more than your monthly salary 
to pay debts, you are clearly overextended. 
</P>
<P>
* Don't borrow long term at high, short-term rates. In other words, don't keep 
a high monthly balance on credit cards when you could refinance that balance 
through a less-expensive home-equity loan. 
</P>
<P>
* When you have insufficient cash flow, don't borrow on equity. 
</P>
<P>
Californians often borrow against equity in real estate, sometimes with the 
intention of "turning" properties -- reselling them quickly -- or developing 
them. 
</P>
<P>
This may not make sense in today's slower real estate environment. Not only 
have home prices stopped rising rapidly, the amount of time required to sell 
one has increased considerably.

IN SOME U.S. CITIES, BIKE-RIDING POLICE ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE

SEATTLE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Silent as the night, the two cops were on the men before they knew what was 
happening. Their bicycles made no noise as they sped along the muddy path under 
the viaduct. 
</P>
<P>
They surprised three prowlers who were watching, from a distance, unsuspecting 
motorists putting their valuables in car trunks. The prowlers had not yet 
zeroed in on a good mark in the parking lot, so officers Debbie Brooks and 
Steve Kilberg found only a hefty screwdriver on them, the kind that could be 
used to pop open a trunk. They told the trio to keep walking. 
</P>
<P>
Five minutes later, the officers arrested a man as he was about to inject 
cocaine into his arm as he sat amid the filth so much a part of life under the 
viaduct -- and consequently the life of Seattle's bike cops. 
</P>
<P>
There were broken bottles and mud-covered remnants of clothing. The guy with 
the needle had heated his cocaine on the peeled-off bottom of an aluminum can. 
He was little more than a kid, but the bike cops had had many dealings with him 
before. 
</P>
<P>
With their prisoner in handcuffs, Brooks and Kilberg wheeled their mountain 
bikes out to the street, where they waited for the paddy wagon. While they were 
there, two other bike cops, Vic Maes and Al Lopez, appeared at the top of the 
hill. 
</P>
<P>
Now that's a pair, Maes and Lopez: Maes is the serious one when he's on the 
street looking for the pushers and dealers he knows by their first names; Lopez 
is a bodybuilder with a soft voice and an eye for the ladies. Many is the time 
Maes has looked back to find his bike partner talking to a pretty woman 
somewhere down the street. 
</P>
<P>
These are four of Seattle's bike cops, and this is the city where mountain 
bikes were first used to go after crooks. What started with two officers making 
rounds in 1987 has evolved into 28 "cycle cops" citywide. 
</P>
<P>
They began in rudimentary sartorial fashion, using rubber bands around their 
legs to keep their pants from being caught in the chain. But the uniform 
quickly became cycling shorts, special lightweight shoes, and, of course, rain 
gear. This is Seattle, after all. 
</P>
<P>
Using bicycles on the beat isn't exactly new. English bobbies rode them. Police 
in the California beach communities have employed them for work on the 
boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
But it was the trick of using mountain bikes, machines designed to go most 
anywhere, that made police on bikes people to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
They can dart down alleys and stairs, zip across parks and up hills. They can 
slither through heavy traffic and go the wrong way on a one-way street. And 
they are so quiet that many a criminal has found himself staring at a badge in 
the middle of an illegal transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Grady, one of the officers who dreamed up the bike idea, said he has 
received queries from almost 200 police departments around the world on how to 
start a cycling squad. He wrote a how-to manual on bike patrols and sold 50 of 
them in two weeks at $44.50 a pop. 
</P>
<P>
Police departments nationwide, from Hollywood, Fla., to Sacramento, Calif., now 
have or are planning bike patrols. They have grown so popular that bike cops 
from around the nation converged on Seattle recently for their own 
mini-Olympics, which Seattle, by the way, won. 
</P>
<P>
It was fitting that the first competition was here, where the bike cops began 
and have flourished in a city that is a cyclist's nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle recently was rated by Bicycling magazine as the best place in the 
nation to practice the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just taken off across the country," said Grady, who has been transferred 
from the bike patrol as he pursues his sergeant's stripes. "It's incredible." 
</P>
<P>
In Salt Lake City, there are plans to almost double the bike force this year, 
from 8 to 14. The New York borough of Queens has them, as does the upscale 
Dallas neighborhood of Highland Park. In Chicago, burglaries were up last year 
-- except in places where there were cops on bikes. And in Tampa, Fla., police 
use bikes to roam high-crime public housing projects. Boston recently began a 
bike program, and the Sacramento Police Department has put all its downtown 
foot patrolmen on bikes. 
</P>
<P>
"I think bike patrols will become standard in the future," said Sacramento 
Police Sgt. Kent Thorpe. "They did it in London a long time ago and now it's 
coming back into style, except updated with mountain bikes." 
</P>
<P>
So popular is the cop on a bike concept that consulting with other departments 
has become almost a full-time job for Grady. He takes vacation time to train 
others. 
</P>
<P>
There are small drawbacks, such as a hefty amount of needling from fellow 
officers and the need for assistance once an arrest is made. "You're not going 
to arrest people and then put them on your handlebars," Grady said. 
</P>
<P>
Brooks and Kilberg were back at the station filling out paper work, and Maes 
and Lopez were on the street. Only a few blocks away is the Pike Street Market, 
one of the major destinations for tourists and locals alike. Fresh fish is 
piled high, as are vegetables. Stalls of handiwork and T-shirts line the 
sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
Maes and Lopez worked the streets a few blocks away, where life takes a serious 
plunge. They call it the "cesspool" and the "pit." It's where drug deals go 
down in the alleys and muggers cruise, looking for prey. 
</P>
<P>
Maes and Lopez know the street people by their first names. They know what 
they're doing and what they're selling. The two cops cruised the alleys, 
pointing to small piles where ends of balloons had been cut off. (Cocaine and 
crack cocaine are stuffed in balloons, which then are knotted before the ends 
are cut off, the better to swallow them if they see cops about to move in.) 
</P>
<P>
Maes and Lopez don't see this scene in quite the same way. Maes is the driven 
one always looking for the bust. He stops known addicts on the street and makes 
them open their mouths to see whether balloons are hidden inside. Lopez 
sometimes tires of the territory, of seeing the same lost faces day after day: 
"Sometimes, it just gets old." 
</P>
<P>
After a lunch of beef teriyaki, they swung up the street and around the corner, 
just in time to see a man and woman get out of a car. The man rolled his eyes 
when he saw Maes and Lopez; the couple are addicts who have had many run-ins 
with the bike cops. 
</P>
<P>
"Man, I swear: We just came down to get our bus passes," the man said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," Maes replied. "Sure. Where'd you get the car?" 
</P>
<P>
"We just borrowed it from a friend," the man said as Maes pulled out his 
citation book. Maes eventually charged him with driving without a license, 
although he could have hit him with much more. 
</P>
<P>
But before he had finished writing the ticket, the couple was talking about how 
they had tried to stay clean, how they had really tried. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez listened to the woman intently. 
</P>
<P>
"I got cleaned up and dirty again, cleaned up and dirty again," she said, 
sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
"You need to get some help," Lopez said. The woman shook her head in assent. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried," the man said. "But we screwed up. We're really stupid." 
</P>
<P>
Down another alley. More balloons. Two kids, one fat, one thin, standing behind 
a trash bin, obviously intent on cutting a drug deal. Maes frisked the thin one 
and found a homemade hash pipe. He pushed the thin one up to the wall and 
lectured him about how stupid he was to be in the area. "People die on this 
street," he told the kid. "People die on that stairway." 
</P>
<P>
Then he put the pipe on the alley and crushed it with the heel of his shoe. 
</P>
<P>
Cruising again. Maes and Lopez swung by an abandoned building, where addicts 
live at times. 
</P>
<P>
This day, something was different. There was a sheet over a window. The cops 
rode to the back of the building, where the rear lot was littered with junk -- 
old wire fence, rotting lumber, bricks. 
</P>
<P>
Maes took the point and Lopez covered, walking stealthily on rotting boards, up 
a flight of stairs and into the putrid room where the addict lived. 
</P>
<P>
He was there and offered no resistance. A paint can was on the floor, filled 
with urine and feces. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes it's a lot worse," Maes said. "Sometimes they just pick a room and 
designate it as the toilet." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks and Kilberg rode up just as the squad car was pulling away. They chatted 
before the call came over the radios attached to their shirts. Two crack 
dealers were peddling their wares on a street about a mile away. The four of 
them moved quickly through traffic, darting around a bus and lines of cars. 
</P>
<P>
Two dealers started running in opposite directions when they saw the bike cops. 
Maes and Lopez went west. Brooks and Kilberg went east. Both got their man. It 
was no contest. 
</P>
<P>
It was late afternoon and the dark clouds were rolling in off Puget Sound. 
</P>
<P>
The sprinkles turned to a downpour as the cops headed for the station to do the 
worst part of police work: the paper work. 
</P>
<P>
The question had been raised several times about what they could point to as 
proof they were having a real effect on the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Kilberg came up with the yellow coat anecdote, referring to the color of the 
rain gear used by the bike cops. 
</P>
<P>
"When the street criminals see a messenger with a yellow coat on, they start 
throwing their dope away," he said. "All statistics aside, you know you're 
doing good."

TV / LARRY STEWART: WORLD CUP '90; 
</P>
<P>
ONLY ONE GOAL, BUT NO COMMERCIAL SHORTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
If you wanted to see scoring, you were a lot better off watching the 
Angel-Brewer game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The World Cup final, whether you watched TNT or Univision's Spanish-language 
coverage on Channel 34, was b-o-r-i-n-g! 
</P>
<P>
Imagine watching a whole basketball game, and the only scoring is a free throw. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe, as former Times staffer George Kiseda suggests, soccer needs a 24-second 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
And the rest of the world wonders why the sport doesn't catch on here. 
</P>
<P>
At least TNT, with its commercial-filled coverage, didn't miss any goals on 
Sunday. The cable network wasn't so lucky in earlier games. 
</P>
<P>
Since there was only one goal scored in Sunday's final -- and that one on a 
penalty kick -- the odds were in TNT's favor. But there sure were a lot of 
intrusive commercials. 
</P>
<P>
The good thing about the World Cup being on both TNT and Channel 34, you could 
avoid the TNT commercials simply by switching stations. 
</P>
<P>
That's a good thing for viewers; it's not so good for TNT sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
Univision knows better than to interrupt live action with commercials. 
</P>
<P>
American television doesn't seem to be able to handle soccer's continuous 
action. And maybe viewers can't, either. 
</P>
<P>
Football and baseball have natural breaks. And basketball has all those 
timeouts, particularly during the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Americans like those breaks. Gives 'em time to go to the refrigerator and drink 
a sponsor's beer or soft drink. 
</P>
<P>
TNT put the World Cup in perspective when studio host Ernie Johnson signed off 
Sunday with: "Remember, the NFL will be on TNT this fall." 
</P>
<P>
NBC's Wimbledon show on Sunday was far more exciting, and the coverage far 
better, than the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
The announcing team of Dick Enberg, Jimmy Connors and Bud Collins did a fine 
job, although Enberg had more slips than normal, such as losing track of the 
score of a game in the fifth set. 
</P>
<P>
Connors, a Ken Brett-soundalike, was a good addition. One positive result was 
less air time for Collins, which seemed to tone him down. 
</P>
<P>
The NBC production overall at Wimbledon was outstanding, and the network had 
the time to do some interesting features and deal with various topics. 
</P>
<P>
Connors and Collins on Sunday sort of kicked the heck out of hi-tech, 
advocating that the men on the pro circuit be required to use only wood 
rackets. 
</P>
<P>
NBC showed hustle by tracking down Althea Gibson in New Jersey for an interview 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Then the network showed compassion by flying Gibson to Wimbledon to witness the 
women's final first hand. 
</P>
<P>
After Gibson told Bob Costas on the air she'd like to go to Wimbledon but 
couldn't afford it, several people, including actor Cliff Robertson, called NBC 
to offer to pay for her trip. But by then NBC had already decided to pay for 
her trip. 
</P>
<P>
Things worked out quite nicely for TV viewers Sunday. The Wimbledon men's final 
was over in time for the soccer, and the soccer was over in time to watch 
Milwaukee's 13-run fifth inning against the Angels on Channel 5. 
</P>
<P>
Commentator Reggie Jackson tried to say the Angels, down 20-7, still had a 
chance to come back. 
</P>
<P>
And on radio Al Conin, tongue-in-cheek, said the Angels might answer with a 
13-run inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels must insist that their announcers think positively. 
</P>
<P>
Conin, always an Angel apologist, also had this observation: "It only counts as 
one loss."

BOY, 6, PULLED UNCONSCIOUS FROM POOL

COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 6-year-old boy who was found at the bottom of a back-yard swimming pool in 
which he had been playing with four other children remained in critical 
condition Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Adam Christopher Harris of Los Angeles was pulled from four feet of water at a 
home in the 200 block of Virginia Place, Costa Mesa Police Sgt. Loren Wyrick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Adam and his brother came to the Costa Mesa home Sunday morning with their 
neighbor, Javier Rangel, a Los Angeles parking lot attendant, and Rangel's two 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Rangel's nephew, Carlos Montes, has rented the three-bedroom home for the past 
year, along with two cousins. Roberto Montes, 26, and Felipe Montes, 19. 
Several times since then, the three have invited friends and relatives over for 
barbecues and to swim in the home's 15-by-30-foot pool. 
</P>
<P>
During the late morning and early afternoon, Adam and four other children 
played in the pool as adults watched them from the back-yard barbecue area, 
said Carlos Montes, who works in a welding shop. 
</P>
<P>
But around 1:50 p.m., one of the children ran to them and said that Adam was at 
the bottom of the pool, Montes said. 
</P>
<P>
"The last we saw he was at the edge playing on the stairs," Montes said. "The 
next thing we knew, he was in the middle of the pool, lying at the bottom. It 
was very rapid the way it happened." 
</P>
<P>
Rangel immediately jumped in the pool and pulled Adam out, Montes said. As 
others went to call an ambulance, Rangel tried to revive Adam by mouth-to-mouth 
resuscitation and by massaging the boy's chest, but the boy didn't respond, 
Montes said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedic Keith Fujimoto said that when he and three other paramedics arrived, 
the scene was "pandemonium." 
</P>
<P>
Adam was lying on the deck face down, he said. Paramedics then tried to revive 
him, but "he was already in cardiac and respiratory arrest," Fujimoto said. 
</P>
<P>
They then rushed him to College Hospital Costa Mesa, where doctors were able to 
restore a pulse, although Adam was still in a coma, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses at the house said Adam could have been under water as long as three 
minutes, Fujimoto said. He added that Adam did not know how to swim and had 
been told to remain "on the edge of the pool." 
</P>
<P>
Montes estimated Sunday afternoon that Adam had been underwater no longer than 
30 seconds judging by the last time an adult had glanced over at the pool area. 
</P>
<P>
Fujimoto said that although so many adults were around, "something like that 
can happen so quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Adam was later transferred to Childrens Hospital of Orange County, where he 
remained in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
Fujimoto said children can experience brain damage after four to six minutes 
under water. 
</P>
<P>
"It was real touch-and-go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Montes described the boy as quiet and "very tranquil." He said that this was 
Adam's first visit to the Costa Mesa home. 
</P>
<P>
Police contacted Adam's parents later in the day, Wyrick said. 
</P>
<P>
"We all feel bad here," Montes said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, five children have drowned in swimming pools 
or hot tubs in Orange County. Drowning is a leading cause of death in the 
county among children under the age of 5. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very tragic, but it could happen to anyone," said Elizabeth McGrail, a 
next-door neighbor.

NIXON LIBRARY DEBUT HAS YORBA LINDA ABUZZ

<P>
With Richard M. Nixon's presidential library set to open in his hometown here 
in less than two weeks, signs of the big day are popping up all over. 
</P>
<P>
A police riot squad has commandeered a preschool across the street as a base of 
operations, to the dismay of some parents. The Secret Service has arranged to 
take over a nearby real estate office so government agents can assume lookout 
positions both inside and on the roof. 
</P>
<P>
And the owner of a local ice cream shop plans to sell a special variety of cake 
featuring Nixon's solemn likeness. 
</P>
<P>
"We will also fly flags and have red, white and blue streamers," said Deloris 
McConnell, owner of the Baskin-Robbins shop. "We're going to try and look like 
we're interested." 
</P>
<P>
Other local merchants plan to go all out for the July 19 dedication of the 
Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace, with plans to sell Nixon necklaces, 
Nixon T-shirts and even Nixon sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
City officials, meanwhile, are finishing up new parking lots and notifying 
residents of road closures on opening day. With as many as 20,000 people 
expected to turn out to see Nixon, President Bush and former Presidents Reagan 
and Ford, city planners have decided to close off Yorba Linda Boulevard in 
front of the library and turn it into a giant parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike such cities as Anaheim and Buena Park, which are flooded with tourists 
visiting amusement parks, Yorba Linda has little experience in dealing with 
large crowds. The city of about 50,000 residents is so low-profile that it 
doesn't have a single hotel or its own police department. Many of the guests 
invited for the library opening will be staying at hotels in surrounding 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
City officials are confident, nevertheless, that they can handle the crowds and 
the massive news media attention, which will include a live broadcast of the 
"NBC Nightly News" anchored by Tom Brokaw from Yorba Linda on the library's 
opening day. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel real comfortable," said Roy Stephenson, Yorba Linda city engineer and 
director of public works. "We've been planning a couple of months on this." 
</P>
<P>
Since the library is near the intersection of two of Yorba Linda's biggest and 
busiest streets -- Yorba Linda Boulevard and Imperial Highway -- traffic should 
not be a disaster, said Assistant City Manager Bruce Channing. The city is also 
opening three satellite parking lots from which to shuttle library visitors on 
opening day, Channing said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have plenty of parking for all the people who want to come," Channing 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After consulting with Anaheim and other larger cities, Channing said Yorba 
Linda designed a crowd control plan that began last week. 
</P>
<P>
A vacant field across the street from the library, for example, was graded to 
provide parking for security teams and other people working the event. City 
crews also started posting orange signs on area roadways warning local 
motorists of the July 19 road closures. Notices were mailed to residents who 
live near the library, advising them of the restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Roads in a triangular area bounded by Yorba Linda Boulevard on the south, 
Imperial Highway on the northeast and Valley View on the west will be closed to 
all but residents and patrons of businesses within that area between 8 a.m. and 
3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Brea Police Department, which contracts with Yorba Linda to provide police 
coverage for the city, last week arranged to take over Yorba Linda Preschool 
&amp; Daycare across the street from the library on opening day, school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Jon Langston, the school administrator, said police want the building for, 
among other things, its restroom. With so much police commotion, Langston said 
he decided to cancel classes that day for the school's 60 children. 
</P>
<P>
"A few parents were not very happy, but we offered to give them a day's 
credit," Langston said. 
</P>
<P>
Brea Police Lt. William Lentini said his officers will use the school as a 
place to cool off and rest between stints at crowd and traffic control. About 
150 Brea officers will be assisting the U.S. Secret Service in providing 
security for the event. 
</P>
<P>
"We're prepared to have a large crowd but a good crowd," Lentini said. 
</P>
<P>
Secret Service officials last week also arranged to use offices of the 
Prudential near the library as a base of operations, according to officials of 
the 50-employee realty company. Although the company intends to remain open for 
business on the big day, armed agents will be prowling the premises, positioned 
behind tinted glass and atop the roof, said Jerry Best, a real estate agent 
there. 
</P>
<P>
"It will definitely not be business as usual," Best said. 
</P>
<P>
Secret Service officials declined to comment on any details of their security 
preparations. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, we do make preparations for a presidential visit," said Joseph Perez, 
assistant special agent in charge of the Secret Service office in Los Angeles. 
"But we don't make (public) specifics regarding a plan." 
</P>
<P>
A few other businesses in the vicinity of the library will be closed on opening 
day because of the difficulty in negotiating the crowded streets and parking 
lots. 
</P>
<P>
"We're planning to stay as far away as possible," said Janet Frazier, a 
receptionist at Michael Frazier Architects in the three-story Yorba Linda 
Packing House office complex across the street from the library. "There'll be 
too many people that day." 
</P>
<P>
Diane Scheiffler, leasing officer for the 42-business complex, said many of the 
businesses are waiting until Tuesday -- when they are scheduled to meet with 
city officials for more information about the Nixon dedication -- to decide 
whether to close or not. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to get the tenants to stay open because once it (the dedication) 
is over, we think we will get some business," Scheiffler said. 
</P>
<P>
Although some business will be lost that day, Yorba Linda Chamber of Commerce 
President Harry Elliott said the overall disruption would be negligible. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a disruption for four hours on one day out of 365," Elliott said. 
"It's not going to hurt anybody. In fact, it will help gas stations, 
restaurants and shopping centers. In addition to that, people walking to and 
from their cars will have an opportunity to do a little window shopping." 
</P>
<P>
Among the beneficiaries of the Nixon dedication will be a nearby Family Fitness 
Center, where manager Chris Kolb said he has already gotten calls from people 
in San Francisco and Los Angeles wanting to use the club's workout facilities 
after attending the dedication. 
</P>
<P>
So far, no celebrities or political bigwigs have inquired -- just regular 
members of the national fitness center chain who don't want to miss exercising 
that day, Kolb said. 
</P>
<P>
Anticipating a rush of business, the Chili's Grill &amp; Bar on Yorba Linda 
Boulevard is doubling its staff and opening a half-hour early on the dedication 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really excited," said Chili's manager Nancy Tooke. 
</P>
<P>
Across the street in the Yorba Linda Station Plaza shopping center, the 30 
businesses in the complex are stocking their shelves with Nixon souvenir items, 
said Joy Miedecke, head of the merchants' association and owner of the Teddy 
Bear Station shop. 
</P>
<P>
"In our shop, we have designed a T-shirt of a Teddy Bear that has one hand with 
Nixon's famous peace sign and the other with an American flag," Miedecke said. 
"We're also going to have a Nixon Teddy Bear necklace." 
</P>
<P>
Fernanda's Italian Cuisine is also modifying its menu to reflect a presidential 
theme. Fernanda Capraro, the restaurant's owner, said she plans to serve a 
Nixon sandwich, although as of Friday she was still not sure what it would be. 
</P>
<P>
"I am trying to find out what kind of sandwich he (Nixon) likes the best," 
Capraro said. "We are going to try and make it very presidential." 
</P>
<P>
However, on streets surrounding the nine-acre library grounds, residents were 
making no special preparations for the big day. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to sit in the back yard and watch it," said Kathy Bigonger, 29, a 
housewife whose Park Place home abuts the library property. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as I've got my parking space, I'll be OK," added Ken Stack, 36, an 
animator who lives on the same street. 
</P>
<P>
Although one female resident grumbled about the upcoming event being "a real 
pain in the butt," most residents interviewed said they looked forward to all 
the activity. 
</P>
<P>
"I voted for Nixon three times, so I'm going to like it," said Radka Egan, 67, 
a retiree who lives on Eureka Avenue. "I think it's going to be beautiful."

WORLD CUP: CHEERS FILLED THE PHOENIX CLUB AS THEIR TEAM SCORED THE WINNING 
GOAL. BUT GLOOM ROLLED THROUGH THE ARGENTINE SOCIAL CLUB.

<P>
The tension had been as strong as the beer and sauerkraut in the Phoenix Club 
on Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
But 84 minutes of nail-biting frustration turned to ecstasy when West Germany's 
national soccer team scored the only goal of the 1990 World Cup championship 
game with just six minutes remaining on the clock. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a victorious time for us," said Phoenix Club secretary Jurgen Maerz as 
about 350 members of the German social club toasted each other with beer and 
champagne and strained their voices singing rowdy German drinking ditties. 
</P>
<P>
"First we have unification (of East and West Germany)," Maerz said seconds 
after West Germany put away Argentina by a 1-0 score. "Now we have the World 
Cup. It's great." 
</P>
<P>
As beer flowed freely among joyous Phoenix Club members, bitter tears were shed 
unabashedly for the Argentine national soccer team at El Club Union Argentina 
de Orange County, located one-half mile away. 
</P>
<P>
For Phoenix Club members, the victory was sweet revenge. In 1986, the last time 
the World Cup was played, the Argentines made a surprise visit to the Phoenix 
CLub and gloated after their national team beat West Germany 3-2 for the 
championship. West Germany lost the previous World Cup final to Italy in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Phoenix Club fans exuded confidence. "If you're a gambling man, 
it's going to have to come up sooner or later," Maerz predicted before the 
start of Sunday's match. "It's the law of averages that we will eventually 
win." 
</P>
<P>
As 150 fans of Argentina began filtering into the Argentina club in Orange, 
hopes were as high as those at the Phoenix Club. 
</P>
<P>
A group of Argentine soccer players founded El Club Union Argentina de Orange 
County about 7 1/2 years ago so that they could have a regular venue for 
barbecues and parties after soccer games. Now more than 500 Argentine-American 
families belong to the club. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we were lucky to get to the final," said Mission Viejo resident George 
Diegmuller, whose grandparents migrated to Argentina from Germany two 
generations ago. "Now that we made it, we will come out with a win. Diego 
(Maradona) and the boys will do it for us." As Argentina's national anthem 
blared over the loudspeakers, a few fans unfurled that country's blue-and-white 
flag. The room then erupted in cheers as three women held one of the flags 
aloft and trotted around the rows of chairs. 
</P>
<P>
Nationalism also ran rampant at the Phoenix Club, as the crowd sang along 
during the national anthem and applauded West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
when he was shown on the wide-screen television. 
</P>
<P>
"People here will get so excited they will blow the roof off at every goal," 
predicted Justin Harven. "This is a real big thing. You don't see this kind of 
excitement with American games." 
</P>
<P>
As the game neared halftime, however, fans started to worry. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it," groaned Helmut Klopsch, who sat at a long table sipping 
Bitburger beer and trading comments with his longtime friends. "Everything they 
are doing is good. But when they get into position they lose the chance." 
</P>
<P>
Tension was also high in Union Argentina, as the Germans made unrelenting 
assaults on the Argentine goal. Club president Tony Seri, 47, took a last long 
draw of his cigarette, crushed the butt under his feet, and then lit another. 
</P>
<P>
"This does not look good," Seri said as the first half ended. "The Germans are 
dominating the game." 
</P>
<P>
With six minutes remaining in the game, the West German team's chance came 
during a hotly contested call by a referee that resulted in a penalty kick for 
the Germans. 
</P>
<P>
"Nooooooooo!" cried the fans at Union Argentina when the referee pointed to the 
penalty spot near Argentina's goal. 
</P>
<P>
As the white soccer ball whooshed past the Argentine goalie and landed in the 
net, the ballroom in the Phoenix club exploded into cheers, stomps and loud 
music. 
</P>
<P>
"This is it," cried Joseph Selcho as the crowd broke into song. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, members of a semi-professional West German soccer team began loudly 
chanting, "auf Wiedersehen, auf Wiedersehen," meaning goodby, to the Argentine 
team. 
</P>
<P>
At the Union Argentina, a hush. A few people immediately headed for the door. 
</P>
<P>
As the final whistle blew, stony silence. Then, almost in unison, the Argentine 
fans headed for the parking lot. A few lingered behind to see their team 
receive its second-place medals. 
</P>
<P>
As Argentina's national idol Diego Maradona cried while he received his medal 
for his team's second-place finish, a teen-ager in the front row in Union 
Argentina brushed a tear from his cheek. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sad," said Susanna Copa who left Argentina for Buena Park 10 years ago. 
"I thought Argentina was going to win." 
</P>
<P>
At the Phoenix Club, members were preparing for a long-awaited night of 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to celebrate into the night, " Phoenix Club president Hans Klein 
yelled as a line of revelers snaked past him in a victory dance.

ICE CARVER HAS A NO-SWEAT JOB;

<P>
ART: JAMES LUFF SPENDS SUMMER DAYS HOLED UP IN A WALK-IN FREEZER SCULPTING 
PARTY CENTERPIECES FROM A MATERIAL MORE COMMONLY SEEN IN PARTY DRINKS.

<P>
As the mercury crept into the 80s one day last week, James Luff bundled up in a 
heavy jacket, rain pants, two pairs of gloves and insulated boots to perform 
what may be Orange County's coolest summer job: ice sculpting. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a way to escape the heat," said Luff, who has been a 
professional ice sculptor for the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
While others flocked to the beaches to bask in the summer sun, Luff closed 
himself inside his freezer-studio and went to work on a 300-pound ice cube. 
</P>
<P>
As the temperature hovered at 16 degrees, Luff first used a lightweight chain 
saw to gently outline the figure he wanted to sculpt. ("I can look at (a block 
of ice) and see what I want to carve inside it," Luff said.) 
</P>
<P>
Then with sweeping strokes of the saw, he chopped away large chunks of ice, and 
a pair of wings and the long neck of a swan soon began to emerge. Gradually, 
the swipes of the saw gave way to precision strokes as Luff defined the slope 
of the breast, the curve of the neck. 
</P>
<P>
For the final touches, Luff employed a pruning saw and a large fork to smooth 
away the rough edges and detail the feathers of his three-foot-tall swan. After 
several hours of work -- and one or two breaks outdoors to warm his hands and 
feet -- Luff's latest creation was ready to stand as the sparkling centerpiece 
to a party, where it would immediately begin to melt away. 
</P>
<P>
Luff professes not to mind the ephemeral nature of his art. "I don't feel bad 
seeing it melt. I enjoy watching the people's reactions, the oohs and aahs . . 
. ," he said. "It's like cooking a good meal for someone. They enjoy it. Then 
it's gone." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Luff has been dabbling in wood carvings recently. "It would be 
nice to have something a little more permanent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Luff, 37, is one of few ice sculptors to make his own ice. 
</P>
<P>
Most carvers buy their ice from manufacturers who typically use a freezing 
system that produces blocks with a cloudy white core. 
</P>
<P>
Luff utilizes a specially designed system that creates blocks of ice as clear 
as crystal. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes three days to make a block of ice, but it's worth the wait," said 
Luff, who also sells his 40-inch-by-20-inch-by-10-inch blocks to other ice 
sculptors. 
</P>
<P>
Luff said he got hooked on ice carving when he was working as a cook in 
Vancouver, Wash., and saw a chef carving a block of ice for a buffet-table 
centerpiece. "He showed me the tools . . . how to use them and told me to go to 
it," he said. "That was my first lesson. After that, I knew ice carving was 
what I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
His works have graced the tables of parties, movie sets, business functions and 
wedding receptions. He created the swan centerpiece in "Beverly Hills Cop" and 
the mermaid in "Dragnet." He even sculpted a pair of lungs that were featured 
on the cover of a medical journal. 
</P>
<P>
By far the largest sculpture he has ever done was a replica of the Egyptian 
Sphinx that required 90 blocks of ice. The entire project cost about $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
In an average month, Luff carves between 30 and 40 sculptures. Most sell for a 
couple hundred dollars to several thousand dollars, depending on their 
complexity and size. 
</P>
<P>
After completing his swan last week, Luff looked outside at the midday sun and 
admitted that the frigid environs of his studio are not always the place to be 
in summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Getting away from the heat is nice, but it also would be nice to enjoy the 
sunny days sometimes," he said with a smile.

COMMISSIONER WHO CRITICIZED LOSES POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A planning commissioner who sharply criticized the City Council during his 
recent unsuccessful campaign for a council seat lost his seat on the commission 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
Harold Kaufman, who spent a two-year term on the city's first Planning 
Commission, was not reappointed by the council for another term. 
</P>
<P>
Kaufman, an insurance claims settler, was the only city commissioner seeking 
reappointment to be rejected for a new term. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess that's politics," Kaufman said. "But I plan to continue being active 
in this city as much as I am able to." 
</P>
<P>
While campaigning for a council seat in the June 5 election, Kaufman had openly 
criticized the City Council members for overturning Planning Commission 
decisions. He also accused them of being too influenced by developers. 
</P>
<P>
Seven candidates sought three council seats in that election. Kaufman came in 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, when making appointments to three commission seats, the council 
chose incumbent Lynn Dawson and newcomers Robert Montgomery and James Hyde. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Mike Eggers, who had borne the brunt of Kaufman's criticism 
during the campaign, entered the motion naming the three appointees. The vote 
was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
Eggers denied it had anything to do with the council race. 
</P>
<P>
This is not a campaign issue," Eggers said. "I can withstand personal attacks; 
I've been attacked before." 
</P>
<P>
But, Eggers said, "we wanted people with respect for each other and respect for 
the staff and, based on (Kaufman's) comments, he doesn't have much respect for 
the council. With all the work we have to do, putting together a general plan, 
a redevelopment agency and a $3-million capital improvement budget, I wanted 
everybody moving in the same direction." LEN HALL

TRANSFER REQUESTS AT UCI INCREASE 18% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Encouraging high school students to complete introductory classes at a 
community college before transferring to UC Irvine appears to be paying off. 
</P>
<P>
As of last Monday, UCI has received 3,742 transfer applications from students 
at community colleges and four-year universities, an 18% increase from the same 
time last year, said Susan Wilbur, special assistant for enrollment management. 
The increase probably will allow UCI to meet its fall goal of admitting 1,150 
students with prior college experience. Last year, the campus fell below that 
goal by about 200 students, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Students transferring from other colleges are easier to accommodate because 
they have completed beginning courses and are ready to enroll in more 
specialized, less crowded classes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Overcrowding at UCI has forced the university to reject qualified high school 
graduates because not enough freshman seats were available. Introductory 
courses at UCI typically are full, with students sometimes spilling into the 
aisles during the fall quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In response, the university has been encouraging qualified freshmen to complete 
one or two years at a community college, after which time they are guaranteed 
acceptance by UCI. 
</P>
<P>
The higher number of transfer students this summer may reflect the success of 
that program, said Juel Lee, director of transfer student services. The 
increase probably also is due to UCI's effort to work with local community 
colleges to create an easy bridge between those schools and UCI, he said. Not 
only has UCI been encouraging qualified students to attend a community college 
first but UCI and community college counselors have also instituted formal 
programs to guide students intending to transfer, Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to lose those people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight of 10 community colleges serving UCI have set up Transfer Centers to 
provide information and counseling about the University of California and 
California State University campuses, Lee said. UCI also set up its ZOT! 
program -- Zero-in On Transferring -- last year to provide counseling to 
community colleges students. TOM McQUEENEY

RECYCLING CREDITED FOR LESSER RATE HIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Brea residents received notice of a $3.01 hike in their monthly trash 
collection bill last July, they were told that the bill would have been even 
more if the city was not on the verge of starting a curbside recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
With county landfill fees climbing 55%, officials said, the city had no choice 
but to pass on an increase, with bills going from $4.92 to $7.93. 
</P>
<P>
This year's fee hike is more modest -- 91 cents -- but again the city is 
pointing to the county as the source of the increase. Landfill gate fees 
account for 71% of the increase, or 65 cents, with the rest going to the 
contractor who hauls and sorts Brea's trash. 
</P>
<P>
And again, the city is pointing to the recycling program as a money saver. If 
the city was not diverting 27% of its trash from landfills, the hike would be 
even more, Pat McCarron, director of maintainance services, told the council. 
</P>
<P>
At lease one resident was not impressed. Ralph Haas told the council that 
residential rate payers were carrying an unfair share of the burden. Commercial 
rates have climbed less than residential rates, Haas said. 
</P>
<P>
Residential rates have increased 61.2% and 11.5% over the last two years, while 
commercial rates have climbed only 29.6% and 17.4% during the same period, Haas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But both McCarron and Councilman Ron Isles said the higher increases in 
residential rates came because commercial payers were already paying 
proportionately more than residential payers. 
</P>
<P>
The fee hike, which passed unanimously, went into effect July 1. DANIELLE A.

ARTS DISCUSSION SCHEDULED TUESDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A discussion on the importance of the arts in the city has been set for Tuesday 
in the Founders Room of the Community Meeting Center. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a lot of discussion about the role of the arts in the image of 
the city, but we want to look at the economic role," said Yaakov Dvir-Djerassi, 
general manager of the Garden Grove Symphony, who organized the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the question of city support for the arts, especially the 
Grove Shakespeare Festival, has been controversial, and public funding has been 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Panelists for the discussion will include Rick Stein, Laguna Playhouse 
executive producer and former Grove Shakespeare Festival managing director, and 
Judith Peterson, director of the Muckenthaler Cultural Center in Fullerton; 
Dvir-Djerassi. 
</P>
<P>
Also, Greg Devereux, Garden Grove's housing director; Barry Zander, marketing 
director for Garden Grove Hospital, and a representative of the Garden Grove 
Shakespeare Festival. The moderator will be Dr. Frank Benest, city manager of 
Brea. 
</P>
<P>
"We will use models of other cities like Brea, Laguna Beach, Fullerton and 
Ashland, Ore.," home of the well-known Ashland Shakespeare Festival, "where an 
entire community lives on the arts," Dvir-Djerassi said. 
</P>
<P>
Business, government and arts leaders have been invited to the discussion at 
7:30 p.m. at 11300 Stanford Ave. JIM TORTOLANO

FETTERS, FRASER ANGELS OF WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pitchers Mike Fetters and Willie Fraser, who gave strong performances in middle 
relief, have been named Angels of the Week by The Times' Orange County Edition. 
</P>
<P>
Fetters earned his first major league victory Saturday by pitching the last two 
innings of the Angels' 11-inning, 4-3 victory at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
He also pitched two innings at Cleveland and 1 1/3 innings at Toronto and did 
not allow an earned run in his three appearances. His ERA has fallen to 3.90. 
</P>
<P>
Fraser pitched five innings Friday, his longest outing in two years, to help 
the Angels defeat Milwaukee, 9-8, in 16 innings. He also pitched 2 1/3 
scoreless innings at Toronto and lowered his ERA to 4.60. 
</P>
<P>
A check for $250 in Fetters' and Fraser's names will be given to the Boys and 
Girls Clubs of Orange County.

MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL; 
</P>
<P>
HIS EFFORT'S THE SAME, BUT NOT THE RESULTS; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: GREG HANSELL PITCHED KENNEDY TO THE SOUTHERN SECTION 3-A CHAMPIONSHIP 
IN 1989, BUT NOW PLAYS FOR A CLASS-A TEAM THAT'S FAR FROM WINNING ANY TITLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Hansell had about as a good a season as a high school pitcher can have a 
year ago, when he pitched Kennedy to the Southern Section 3-A title and was 
selected The Times' Orange County player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
But since Hansell has turned professional, he has found success much harder to 
come by. 
</P>
<P>
The right-hander is 6-7 for Winter Haven, the Boston Red Sox's Class-A team in 
the Florida State League. He has a 3.50 earned-run average in 92 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
But Hansell's record, which is the best on the team, is worth an explanation. 
Winter Haven was 6-44 at one time and finished the first half of the season 
16-54. In the second half, the team is 6-11 so far. 
</P>
<P>
"You just have to keep believing in yourself," Hansell, 19, said. "You learn 
something each time you go out there, no matter what happens, win or lose. It's 
hard, but that's what you have to do when things are going badly for the team." 
</P>
<P>
Hansell has spent most of this season working on two things: his changeup and 
his control. He also throws a fastball and a curve. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school, I pretty much went with my fastball," Hansell said. "When you 
get in trouble you go with your best stuff anyway, but here the hitters are 
better so you have to be, too. You have to have more than one pitch." 
</P>
<P>
His senior year in high school, Hansell dominated batters with ease. He pitched 
a perfect game against Garden Grove and finished with a 13-1 record and a 1.24 
ERA. He had 123 strikeouts and 25 walks in 96 innings. 
</P>
<P>
His final victory was 1-0 over Saugus and pitcher Roger Salkeld in the Southern 
Section 3-A title game at Dodger Stadium. Salkeld, who was a first-round pick 
by Seattle in the 1989 draft, pitches for San Bernardino in the California 
League. 
</P>
<P>
Hansell was also a linebacker on the Kennedy football team and had signed to 
play football and baseball at Nevada Reno. But he passed up the scholarship 
after being picked by the Red Sox in the seventh round of the draft. 
</P>
<P>
After signing last summer, he was sent to the Red Sox's Class-A team at Gulf 
Coast (Florida). He was 3-2 with a 2.52 ERA in two months. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a big change last season," he said. "I went from being a hero to going 
back to being just another blue-collar worker. But that was the choice I made." 
</P>
<P>
Power pitcher. Alan Newman continues to have a strong season for Kenosha 
(Wisconsin), the Twins' team in the Class-A Midwest League. 
</P>
<P>
Newman, a left-handed starter from Fullerton College and La Habra High School, 
leads the league with a 1.35 earned-run average. He is fourth in victories 
(8-2) and third in strikeouts (110). 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time. It's a two-parter this time around. What former Orange County high 
school player was the starting pitcher for the National League in the 1974 
All-Star Game? 
</P>
<P>
And what former county high school pitcher was the loser in the 1973 game for 
the American League? It's two different people. 
</P>
<P>
Answers below. 
</P>
<P>
Roommate lost. Hansell and Jason Friedman, a former Cypress College standout, 
were roommates this season at Winter Haven until three weeks ago, when Friedman 
was reassigned. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman, a left-handed hitting first baseman, was sent to Elmira (New York), 
the Red Sox's Class-A team in the New York-Penn League. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman was pretty much a flop in Winter Haven, hitting just .163 with one 
home run and only 11 RBIs in 49 games. 
</P>
<P>
But at Elmira things have gone much better. He is hitting .352 with 10 RBIs in 
15 games. 
</P>
<P>
O'Leary on fire. Troy O'Leary has been among the hottest hitters in the minors 
the past two weeks. O'Leary, an outfielder from Cypress High School, has gone 
18 for 35 to raise his average from .267 to .301 for Class-A Beloit (Wisconsin) 
in the Midwest League. 
</P>
<P>
O'Leary was better known as a football player at Cypress but gained the scouts' 
attention in an Empire League baseball game against Esperanza High in 1987. The 
scouts had come to watch Esperanza's Tom Redington, but O'Leary performed well 
enough to warrant some interest. 
</P>
<P>
O'Leary was taken in the 13th round and signed with the Brewers in the summer 
of '87. In three years and over a span of 180 games, he had a batting average 
of .311 in Class-A play before this season. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia Answers. Andy Messersmith (Western High School) of the Dodgers was the 
starter in the 1974 game, won by the National League, 7-2, in Pittsburgh. Bert 
Blyleven (Santiago) took the loss in the 1973 game, also won by the National 
League, 7-1, in Kansas City.

RESTRUCTURED POLITBURO SEEN AS GORBACHEV VICTORY

<P>
The Soviet Communist Party voted today to change its leadership structure in a 
clear victory for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the crucial party congress. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates voted by a large margin to bring the party chiefs from the 15 
republics into an expanded Politburo -- a move that will almost certainly stop 
conservative hard-liners from forming a bloc against Gorbachev on the body. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said the new setup favored the reformist Gorbachev, who would have 
much less difficulty controlling the republican party chiefs than contending 
with Moscow-based politicians. 
</P>
<P>
The Politburo now numbers 12 full members, most of them with Moscow power 
bases. Gorbachev himself suggested that the total membership could be 23 or 24 
after inclusion of specialist secretaries nominated by the Central Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Delegates voted by a big margin to retain the post of party general secretary 
rather than create the new title of party chairman at the head of a presidium. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, 59, who is general secretary as well as state president, has been 
assured by both left and right in the party that he will be reelected party 
leader later this week. 
</P>
<P>
The changes also provided for the new post of a deputy to the general secretary 
who would be a full Politburo member and, like the party chief, be elected 
directly by the congress. 
</P>
<P>
The 28th Communist Party Congress, which opened July 2, has been the scene of 
bitter feuding between Gorbachev and his reform-minded allies on the one hand 
and conservative hard-liners opposed to his radical reforms on the other. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere sharpened further today when a close ally of Gorbachev, 
Politburo member Alexander Yakovlev, said he was the target of a slander 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
The congress approved an investigation by the party after Yakovlev said 
documents falsifying recent comments he had made to political meetings were 
being circulated on the fringes of the congress. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to tell those who are behind this campaign that they may shorten my 
life, but they will never manage to silence me," the 66-year-old Yakovlev said. 
</P>
<P>
Yakovlev, architect of Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, said the 
documents contained "distortions" of comments he had recently made to young 
Communists and members of the Democratic Platform and Marxist Platform 
factions. 
</P>
<P>
The falsified documents said he had encouraged them to quit the party. 
</P>
<P>
But a 15-page document circulated later setting out what he said was the 
correct version of his remarks made clear he had urged them to stay in the 
party and cooperate in a renewal of its ranks.

In a dawn raid on a Stanton gang stronghold, police arrested a 15-year-old boy 
on suspicion of murdering Rosendo Ibarra, a 17-year-old shot in the head while 
talking to his girlfriend on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
Two other suspects in the April murder, including the man police believe pulled 
the trigger, were not at home. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove police were still searching for them early this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe the 15-year-old, whose name was not released because of his age, 
helped plan Ibarra's murder. 
</P>
<P>
"He took part in the conspiracy, and we believe he went with the fellows that 
did it and walked right up with the shooter," said Detective Mike Handfield of 
the Garden Grove Police. 
</P>
<P>
The killing was believed to be the latest spasm in a decades-old dispute 
between residents of the Rose Street neighborhood in Stanton and the La Colonia 
neighborhood in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Ibarra, a construction worker who lived in La Colonia, was gunned down at a pay 
phone in a Garden Grove shopping center across the street from his home.

U.S. Border Patrol agents nabbed 920 suspected illegal immigrants in a weekend 
raid that authorities said could have set a record. 
</P>
<P>
Immigration officials said they also arrested three suspected alien smugglers 
during the five-hour sweep at the San Clemente checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
The sweep tied up northbound traffic for several miles on Interstate 5 from 5 
p.m. to 10 p.m. on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"The action shows the magnitude of the influx of illegal aliens in the U.S.," 
Douglas Becktel, a supervising Border Patrol agent, said. "We anticipated 
catching up to a thousand people. We've seen a dramatic increase in the number 
of illegal aliens coming, even with the new laws." 
</P>
<P>
Most of those arrested were Mexican immigrants and they were either walking or 
riding in cars and trucks trying to pass the checkpoint, Becktel said. He said 
all chose to waive a hearing before an immigration judge and were driven back 
to the border and deported.

SOVIETS HEAT UP THE SUMMIT;

<P>
LEADERS OF 7 NATIONS AT ODDS ON AID

<P>
Leaders of the world's seven richest nations opened summit talks today sharply 
at odds over aid to the Soviet Union. Trade and environmental disputes also 
threatened the harmony. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush challenged his partners "to bring a new stability and prosperity 
to the world by tapping the power and energy of free wills and free markets." 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of agreement on Soviet aid, the leaders may agree to send a team 
of Western bankers and other experts to Moscow to assess needs in 
transportation, marketing and other areas, diplomatic sources said. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. source predicted that the summit will produce a strong statement of 
support for Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika program of economic reforms and 
will recognize the need of each country to act on an individual basis in terms 
of direct financial assistance. 
</P>
<P>
At an outdoor welcoming ceremony -- shortened because of the unrelenting Texas 
heat -- Bush said: "A new world of freedom (lies) before us. Hopeful. 
Confident. A world where peace endures, where commerce has a conscience and 
where all that seems possible is possible." 
</P>
<P>
"So let us begin, in good faith, to set the stage for the new millennium," the 
President said. 
</P>
<P>
Cannon salutes and military pageantry greeted the leaders of West Germany, 
Britain, France, Italy, Canada and Japan as they assembled on the campus of 
Rice University for three days of talks. 
</P>
<P>
A fife-and-drum corps decked out in white wigs and Revolutionary War costumes 
added to the colorful opening. 
</P>
<P>
The 16th annual gathering of the world's largest industrial democracies was the 
first economic summit of the post-Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
With the cooling of East-West tensions, summit countries are grappling with 
different strategies to extend a welcoming hand to East Europe and the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, senior Soviet officials rejected Bush's reasons for resisting help 
for the Soviet Union. The President has expressed concerns over Soviet military 
spending, Soviet subsidies for Cuba and the lack of reforms in Moscow's 
government-controlled economy. 
</P>
<P>
"To dictate conditions to such a country as the Soviet Union, a great power, is 
embarrassing," said Gorbachev staff member Georgy Shakhnazarov. "We aren't 
taking orders." 
</P>
<P>
On a more conciliatory note, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said, "We 
understand if no one wants to take a risk. The U.S.A. isn't speaking in favor 
of development of economic cooperation if reform doesn't proceed as we plan." 
</P>
<P>
White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu said the Western leaders lined up 
"about half on one side, and half on the other" over how to provide financial 
assistance to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
He said Bush recognized that other countries "may have a slightly different 
agenda that would drive" their actions. "We understand that others may have a 
different sequence of decisions and timing of decisions to be made. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
On other disputes, Europeans are resisting Bush's demand for phasing out farm 
subsidies over the next 10 years and, together with Canada, are pushing for 
agreement on new steps to halt global warming.

CZECH EX-PARTY BOSS SENTENCED TO 4 YEARS

<TEXT>
<P>
Prague's former Communist Party boss was found guilty today of abuse of power 
and sentenced to four years in jail in the first conviction of a member of the 
country's former hard-line leadership. 
</P>
<P>
The official, Miroslav Stepan, had ordered use of water cannon and tear gas 
against demonstrators in Prague in the fall of 1988. A year later, a popular 
uprising toppled the authoritarian Communist government. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Czechoslovak citizens crowded in front of the small room where the 
district court verdict was handed down, and some expressed satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
"That serves him right -- that's exactly what he deserved," an elderly woman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Under Czechoslovak law, sentencing comes at the time of conviction. 
</P>
<P>
Stepan appealed the verdict but was to remain in custody. No date was set for 
the appeal, which was to be heard by a municipal court. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that he had "unjustifiably" overstepped the bounds of his 
office when, as chairman of the Prague Defense Council, he ordered the action 
against the demonstrators Oct. 28, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
He was also accused of having demonstrators transported outside Prague in 
January, 1989, after they failed to disperse as ordered by police. 
</P>
<P>
Stepan, 44, was arrested Dec. 23, 1989, less than a month after stepping down 
as Prague party boss. He was the first member of the country's Communist 
leadership to be brought to trial. 
</P>
<P>
The trial, which began June 25, was initially held behind closed doors but was 
opened to the public four days later after strong complaints in the 
Czechoslovak media. 
</P>
<P>
Stepan had pleaded innocent and said it was a political trial. He appealed to 
President Vaclav Havel to hold no more such trials. 
</P>
<P>
Five other former high-ranking officials, including Communist Party leader 
Milos Jakes and chief ideologue Vasil Bilak, were detained last month and 
accused of "serious criminal activity." But all were released within 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Stepan, who joined the party's ruling Politburo in December, 1987, had a 
reputation as a ruthless hard-liner.

An inquiry will be held into the conduct of a steamship captain who was 
censured for not helping the Titanic when it sank 78 years ago, the government 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 of the 2,200 people on board died when the ship struck an 
iceberg and sank in April, 1912. 
</P>
<P>
The Marine Accident Investigation Branch will examine testimony at the original 
inquiry to gain new insight into the role of the late Capt. Stanley Lord, said 
a spokeswoman for the Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The inquiry comes in response to a campaign by Lord's relatives, who have been 
trying to clear his name, said the spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Lord was master of the Boston-bound Californian, which was believed to have 
been the ship nearest the Titanic when the British liner went down in the North 
Atlantic while steaming to New York on its maiden voyage. 
</P>
<P>
Other ships that were farther away did reach the scene in answer to the 
stricken liner's distress calls. 
</P>
<P>
Lord's ship was stopped by ice at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Lord died in 1962, claiming to the end that the Titanic was in an ice field 20 
miles or more from his ship and that he was unable to help.

Authorities can't find rhyme or reason to the theft of a statue commemorating 
the little lamb that followed 19th-Century resident Mary Sawyer to school one 
day. 
</P>
<P>
The heist on July 1 has vexed some residents who believe they have been robbed 
of a piece of history. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't understand anybody taking it," said Karen Gaylord, a 20-year resident 
and part-time spokeswoman for the Sterling Police Department. "It has great 
historical value to the town, but it's not something that you could sell." 
</P>
<P>
The concrete statue of the lamb had stood on the town common since the early 
1960s and was a fixture of this central Massachusetts town of 6,000, said Ruth 
Hopfmann of the Sterling Historical Society.

Tammy Faye Bakker, in a letter from Florida to the folks back home, denied 
tabloid reports that she is planning to divorce her imprisoned evangelist 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Bakker, 50, is serving a 45-year sentence for fraud and conspiracy stemming 
from the way he raised and spent money at PTL, the television ministry and 
Christian resort he founded in Ft. 
</P>
<P>
Mill, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Faye visited him last week at the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, 
Minn. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Tammy Faye rambles on for 3 1/2 pages on the subject of fear, 
before getting around to what inquiring minds really want to know. 
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no truth to the latest tabloid story which says Tammy is 
divorcing Jim," she writes. "It saddens my heart to see the number of 
Christians who buy and read and believe the lies of these destructive 
publications." 
</P>
<P>
A tabloid recently reported Tammy Faye was seeking a $50-million divorce 
settlement from Bakker, who, according to the report, had squirreled away that 
amount in a Swiss bank.

A Japanese railway and real estate developer has earned the ranking of the 
world's richest businessman for the fourth straight year, according to Forbes' 
annual list of the world's billionaires released today. 
</P>
<P>
And American real estate tycoon Donald Trump, who suffered huge financial 
setbacks during the year, was dropped from the list. 
</P>
<P>
With an estimated net worth of $16 billion, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi ranked first 
among 271 individuals and families worldwide whose personal net assets are 
worth more than $1 billion, Forbes said in its July 23 issue. 
</P>
<P>
The United States led the list with 62 individual billionaires and 37 
billionaire families, for a total of 99, the magazine said. Japan followed with 
40 billionaire fortunes, and West Germany ranked a close third with 38, Forbes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ranking second after Tsutsumi was another Japanese businessman, Taikichiro 
Mori, a former economics professor turned real estate developer, the magazine 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The highest-ranking American on the list was Wal-Mart Stores founder Sam Moore 
Walton and his family who, with a combined net worth of $13.3 billion, placed 
third. Coming in fourth was the Du Pont family, with a combined net worth of 
$10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Ranking fifth were two Swedish brothers, Hans and Gad Rausing, who control a 
packaging empire worth $9.6 billion, the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
John Werner Kluge, founder of Metromedia, continues to be the richest 
individual American billionaire, with an estimated net worth of $5.2 billion, 
Forbes said. 
</P>
<P>
Other Americans earning a spot on the list were financier Warren Edward 
Buffett, publishers S. I. and Donald Newhouse and H. Ross Perot, founder of 
Electronic Data Systems. Other Americans on the list included real estate mogul 
Harry Helmsley, cable television maverick Ted Turner, Laurence and Preston 
Tisch of Loews Corp., takeover artist and head of Pan American World Airways 
Carl Icahn, publisher Rupert Murdoch and David Rockefeller.

AMERICANS SPEND LESS ON MEDICAL CARE

<P>
Despite spiraling health care costs, Americans are using a smaller chunk of 
their income for out-of-pocket medical expenses than they were 30 years ago, a 
team of government economists reports. 
</P>
<P>
The bite is about the same as in 1972-73, said the Health Care Financing 
Administration researchers. 
</P>
<P>
The reason, says Katharine R. Levit, is that private insurance is providing 
more benefits -- in large part because states are requiring more coverage -- 
and employers have been unsuccessful in shifting the costs of better coverage 
to workers. 
</P>
<P>
That's bound to change, she predicts, as consumers are pressured to carry a 
larger share of the burden. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, spending from all sources for health care in the United States was 
nearly $540 billion -- more than 11% of the gross national product that year, 
Levit and two colleagues reported in an article published in the summer issue 
of Health Affairs, a quarterly journal on health policy. 
</P>
<P>
The figures tallied by Levit, Mark Freeland and Dan Waldo are the latest 
comprehensive figures available, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Of the total, $312 billion came from private sources -- including $113 billion 
paid by consumers out of pocket and $175 billion paid by private insurance. 
Federal, state and local governments contributed $228 billion. 
</P>
<P>
National health expenditures have risen more than 11% annually over the last 
three decades, and 10.4% from 1987 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 spending amounted to $2,124 for every man, woman and child in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Americans used about 5% of their after-tax income in 1988 on health care 
expenses -- including their share of insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs 
to meet deductibles and pay for medical care not covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
This proportion is the same as in 1972-73 and lower than the 6.1% of after-tax 
income used for health care expenses in 1960-61, the researchers reported.

The Federal Aviation Administration is keeping an eye on Donald Trump's 
helicopter service after reports of firings of pilots and allegations of 
financial improprieties, a published report said today. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA began surveillance over Trump Air after abrupt firings of several 
pilots and top managers, allegations of financial improprieties and a takeover 
of Trump Air by the Taj Mahal casino's security force, the New York Post said. 
</P>
<P>
Trump's helicopter service, which shuttles gamblers to and from Atlantic City, 
is struggling to remain in operation in the face of financial difficulties 
throughout the Trump organization. 
</P>
<P>
The report said that five pilots were fired last month, along with the chief 
operating officer and director of flight operations, and that several 
maintenance workers have resigned.

ENVIRONMENTAL CRITICISM OF U.S. IRKS SUNUNU

White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu angrily rejected criticism today by 
environmental groups that the United States and its industrial allies are 
polluting the planet, saying the complaints are just "emotional rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking as a summit of the world's seven leading economic powers started, 
Sununu said the United States had set an outstanding example in allocating 
funds to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at it in terms of the real cleanup, the United States has an 
outstanding performance relative to the rest of the countries of the world," he 
said in an interview on ABC's "Good Morning America". 
</P>
<P>
"They can rate their emotional rhetoric. When they come around to rating 
performance, the United States does very, very well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu was responding to a score card on environmental performance issued by a 
group of international ecological groups Sunday that severely criticized the 
records of all seven summit participants -- the United States, Britain, France, 
West Germany, Japan, Canada and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The score card said West Germany did the best of the seven and Italy the worst 
in protecting the environment. The United States was rated "fair to poor" in 
most categories. 
</P>
<P>
Sununu is viewed by environmentalists as their main opponent within the Bush 
Administration. They say he constantly presses the President to water down 
ecological initiatives because they might inhibit economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
The United States is likely to find itself under pressure at the summit over 
proposals to combat global warming by limiting emissions of greenhouse gases.

<P>
An archeologist wants to dig up the lawn of Charles Kuralt's vacation home, but 
the television newsman has been -- where else -- on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Wesleyan University archeology Prof. John Pfeiffer believes the immaculate lawn 
in front of Kuralt's home may conceal artifacts that would tell scholars more 
about the development of Essex as an ivory-processing center in the 19th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
The only obstacle has been tracking down Kuralt and getting his permission. 
</P>
<P>
"I bet you he'd be so interested in this, he'd literally want to film it," said 
Donald Malcarne, a graduate student working with Pfeiffer. 
</P>
<P>
Kuralt gained fame for his "On the Road" series, a folksy look at the byways of 
American life. 
</P>
<P>
Malcarne said he wrote Kuralt at his Essex address in May, has knocked on the 
door of the house a number of times and has called Kuralt's office at CBS News 
in New York -- all to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
"Most weekdays, he's traveling for 'On the Road,' " said Karen Beckers, the 
program's coordinator. She said Kuralt has a backlog of messages to return. 
</P>
<P>
Pfeiffer and Malcarne want to dig a few 18-inch "test pits" to see what lies 
below Kuralt's turf. 
</P>
<P>
Beneath the lush green cover, they say, may lie a trove of ivory "notions" -- 
eyelets, combs, perhaps even billiard ball fragments -- turned out by the kind 
of machines first used to shape such objects out of bone.

Actor Sinbad's character on NBC's "A Different World" will become a counselor 
on the television show, helping students deal with social problems and sex 
education, said one of the show's producers. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Oakes will leave his coaching job at the fictional Hillman College next 
season for a new position with the campus-based program, said co-executive 
producer Susan Fales in TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
Fales said the change was prompted by visits to Spelman and Morehouse, two 
colleges in Atlanta that served as models for the fictional Hillman. She said 
students there demonstrated "an increasing concern with civil rights and a 
resurgence of African-American pride." 
</P>
<P>
In his new position, Walter becomes "the voice of what's happening in the black 
community," heading a program that "will address social problems, like sex 
education, teen pregnancy, drugs," said Fales. 
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old comedian-actor said he will enjoy his character's new 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
When told in a recent telephone interview of the new direction his character 
will take, Sinbad said, "Oh, great! I can really get wild off counseling."

When country music singer Dan Seals and his wife bought property that included 
a slave cemetery, help came pouring in from those who wanted to clean it up. 
</P>
<P>
"It just evolved into a big thing around those people who were directly 
involved -- us because we live there and the descendants of people that were 
buried there," Seals said. 
</P>
<P>
Seals and his wife, Andi, learned that the cemetery on their land near 
Nashville once served as the graveyard for slaves at the Rock Castle 
plantation. Members of two nearby black churches pitched in to restore it. 
</P>
<P>
"They started giving their time and effort and flowers and trees," Seals said. 
</P>
<P>
Seals, a member of the pop group England Dan and John Ford Coley in the 1970s, 
recently switched over to country-style music. He performed last month at a 
rally in Bulgaria, before the Eastern Euopean's country's first free election 
in 48 years.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: TANNING PILL WITH CANTHAXANTHIN MAY DAMAGE VISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GRAEDON, AND TERESA GRAEDON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: With all the warnings about the dangers of getting too much sun, I 
was intrigued by an ad I recently saw for a tanning pill. It contains something 
called canthaxanthin which is supposed to be natural, harmless and approved by 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
These tanning pills sound too good to be true but they aren't cheap. What do 
you think? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Canthaxanthin is a food coloring that is chemically related to beta 
carotene, the orange color in carrots. The amount of this agent used in food, 
however, is minuscule compared to the levels found in tanning pills. 
</P>
<P>
Such products do not produce a golden glow that resembles a natural tan. The 
skin tends to turn more an orange color, and the stool can turn red. More 
alarming are reports of golden yellow crystals that show up in the retina of 
the eye. Prolonged use of these products may even lead to visual damage. The 
FDA has NOT approved canthaxanthin for use in tanning pills, so these products 
are illegal. If the FDA discovers them being sold, they are seized and removed 
from the market. 
</P>
<P>
You are right to avoid a "natural" tan, but tanning pills don't appear to be 
risk-free either. Another alternative is dihydroxyacetone, a tanning lotion 
found in products such as Clinique Self-Tanning Formula, Coppertone Sunless 
Tanning Lotion and Estee Lauder Self-Action Tanning Creme. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I just picked up a new prescription and the pharmacist told me not to store 
the pills in the bathroom. I like to keep my medications in the medicine chest 
so I remember to take them first thing in the morning. If the lid is on tight, 
what difference does it make where they are stored? 
</P>
<P>
A: Check your bathroom mirror. If it fogs up when you take a shower or bath, 
there is too much humidity in the air to be good for drugs. Child-proof caps 
can't seal that moisture out. And even regular lids let humidity in every time 
the bottle is opened.

Television personality Monty Hall says he can't even go to the men's room 
without some wag uttering his familiar line. 
</P>
<P>
Hall says it is almost inevitable when he walks into a restroom and faces a 
lineup of stalls that someone will say: "Do you want door No. 1, door No. 2 or 
door No. 3?" 
</P>
<P>
"They all think they invented the line," Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
But beginning this week, that line will be uttered by Bob Hilton, who is taking 
over Hall's host role on a new version of "Let's Make a Deal." 
</P>
<P>
Hall, who was in Ft. Worth last weekend for a convention appearance, is a 
consultant and business partner in the new "Deal." At 66, Hall said he is glad 
it is Hilton, and not him, reviving the show.

The wife of Mayor David N. Dinkins praised burn victim David Opont for "showing 
more courage than people twice your age" by refusing to take drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Opont, 12, suffered second- and third-degree burns in March when a neighborhood 
bully tied him to a pole in an abandoned garage and set him afire when he 
refused to smoke crack, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
His accused attacker, a 14-year-old, has been charged with attempted murder, 
kidnaping, assault and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, at a fund-raiser for David at Manhattan Community College, 
Joyce Dinkins praised the young man for standing up and saying no. 
</P>
<P>
"True, you are just a child of 12," she said. "But when you refused to take 
that poison drug into your system that fateful day . . . you took one giant 
step into manhood." 
</P>
<P>
Actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, of "The Cosby Show," was the master of ceremonies 
Sunday. At one point, he embraced David and told him: "David, you've got my 
respect, man." 
</P>
<P>
David had his own words of encouragement: "I've got a message for all the 
children who are growing up. Have courage to just say no to drugs."

Celebrations of West Germany's World Cup victory turned deadly violent today as 
hooligans attacked police and foreigners, smashed windows and looted stores in 
both German states. 
</P>
<P>
Police said four people were killed and more than 100 injured during melees and 
wild celebrations across the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Germans poured into the streets in scores of cities to 
savor the emotional victory Sunday night, but roving bands of rowdies and 
neo-Nazi skinheads are blamed for using the celebrations for violent rampages. 
</P>
<P>
The violence lasted into this morning, and widespread vandalism and looting 
were reported in numerous cities. 
</P>
<P>
In the West German city of Hamburg, about 400 hooligans hurled rocks and 
bottles at police. Fifty-four police officers were injured and 88 people were 
arrested, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Windows of more than 20 stores were smashed, one bar was destroyed and several 
police and private autos were damaged by the mob, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Police used truncheons and water cannons to break up the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany's 1-0 victory over Argentina had strong political overtones for 
this nation that is about to unite with its eastern neighbor, and is making 
plans to field a single Olympic team including East German athletes. 
</P>
<P>
East Germans took part in the celebrations and the violence. 
</P>
<P>
In East Berlin, neo-Nazi skinheads rampaged on the city's main square, 
Alexanderplatz, and smashed the windows of a bar frequented by homosexuals and 
attacked passers-by. Three people were seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
The skinheads reportedly chased Vietnamese living and working in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Twelve people were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
In the Rhine River city of Cologne, a reveler died when he smashed a window in 
a moving streetcar, leaned out and was struck by a concrete pillar, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the city of Heilbronn in southwest West Germany, two people died when their 
car slammed into a lamppost and was ripped in two. In Geislingen, a speeding 
car with four fans smashed into a post, killing one and seriously injuring 
three. 
</P>
<P>
In the West German city of Schwetzingen, 37 people were injured when a fan 
drove his car into a crowd celebrating in the street. 
</P>
<P>
In West Berlin, four youths were seriously injured when they tumbled from a 
moving truck when it sideswiped a highway overpass support, tearing open its 
door. 
</P>
<P>
In Cologne, a mob surrounded a car driven by an 18-year-old Turk and threatened 
to lynch him, police in the city said. The car was violently rocked, and three 
people were hurt when the driver tried to drive away.

Tennessee tailback Chuck Webb, who was suspended for the spring semester for 
allegedly cheating on an exam, has regained his academic eligibility to play 
football for the Volunteers this fall, a university official said today. 
</P>
<P>
"He's in good shape," said Phil Scheurer, university vice chancellor of student 
affairs who suspended Webb in January. 
</P>
<P>
Webb, who rushed for 1,236 yards as a redshirt freshman last season and was 
most valuable player in Tennessee's Cotton Bowl victory over Arkansas, was 
suspended Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
NCAA rules stipulate a student-athlete must pass an average of 24 units 
annually to be eligible to play football. 
</P>
<P>
Scheurer said Webb received only three units of credit in the fall 1989 
semester before his suspension. Scheurer said Webb took correspondence courses 
in the spring and summer to fulfill the academic requirement.

</P>
<P>
Andre Dawson of the Cubs will bat fifth and play right field, and Cincinnati

</P>
<P>
Los Angeles catcher Mike Scioscia will bat seventh, followed by St. Louis 
Cardinals shortstop Ozzie Smith and Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
The weatherman says it will rain. Maybe thunder, too. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a chance, no, make that likely, there will be showers and 
thunderstorms during the game," Bob Somrek of the U.S. Weather Service in 
nearby Rosemont, Ill., said today. "I would bring an umbrella." 
</P>
<P>
And for those fans sitting in the bleachers, don't bother bringing a glove, 
said fellow meteorologist Larry Hildrebrand. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be a pitcher's day," he said. "The wind will be blowing in from center 
field, about 10 to 15 m.p.h." 
</P>
<P>
Somrek could not predict how long the rain would last. The All-Star game never 
has been completely rained out, although it was shortened to five innings in 
1961 and postponed for a day in 1969.

</P>

BATLIK PADDLING SAME BOAT THAT BROUGHT HIM TO SAFE HARBOR

<P>
There are faster canoes than the one that belongs to Jirka Batlik. Sunday 
afternoon in the finals of the U.S. Olympic Festival 500-meter one-man sprint, 
there were four of them. 
</P>
<P>
But to Batlik, it's still a special vessel. 
</P>
<P>
He calls it his lifeboat. 
</P>
<P>
Fourteen years ago, that canoe carried him to freedom, from behind a curtain 
that was still iron and from under a fist of the same mettle. Batlik spent the 
first 23 years of his life in Prague, Czechoslovakia, most of them devoted to 
finding a way out. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been planning it since 1968, when the Russians first came in," Batlik 
says. "It was awful. Very bad. I was 15 at the time and a friend of mine got 
killed, right before my eyes. I'd known him for 14 years. We went to preschool 
together. I saw a lot of blood. . . . Horrible things happened. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know anything about the United States, but I said, 'There's got to be 
a better place to live than this, being under the gun all the time. It was then 
that I decided to defect. 
</P>
<P>
"I planned it many times. But I got to do it when I was 23." 
</P>
<P>
That was in December of 1976, two days before Christmas. As a member of the 
Czech national canoe team, Batlik was granted permission to travel to Linz, 
Austria, for the European championships. 
</P>
<P>
Batlik only got as far as Innsbrook. 
</P>
<P>
"I never made it to the site," he says. "I had made friends with some Austrian 
paddlers the year before and we had it all arranged. I got across the border 
and split. The Austrians took me to Innsbrook and I stayed there, hiding. I was 
scared. I knew the Communists would be after me." 
</P>
<P>
Batlik had already been gray-listed by the party. "I was very outspoken against 
the Communists," he says, "and I was never allowed to compete in Western 
Europe. They knew how I felt. If the race was in Poland or Hungary or Russia, I 
could go. But France or Sweden, no." 
</P>
<P>
And Batlik already had tried to defect once, in 1972, with three other Czech 
teammates. "We had the passports faked and everything," he says. "But one of 
the guys talked about it and the police found out and took our passports. I 
thought I was never going to get out. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided the next time, I was going to go it alone. Just me. Nobody else." 
</P>
<P>
Batlik remembers everything about that day, down to his parting words to his 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
"I took my mom to work and when I dropped her off, I said to her, 'I'm going to 
Austria,' " he says. "She didn't say a word. She knew exactly what I meant." 
</P>
<P>
Batlik is pleased to report that his defection was easier than most. "I didn't 
do anything crazy, like swimming a river or jumping a fence," he says with a 
grin. "I wasn't going to take a chance and get killed, although if I knew then 
what I know now about America, I would've taken any chance. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd seen America in the movies and from talking to some of our athletes who 
travelled. I wanted to go there and live a better life -- not financially or 
for personal gain, but just to be able to do this, to do that without having to 
ask permission. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted that kind of life and I chose one of the ways most acceptable to get 
there -- sports." 
</P>
<P>
Two months later, Batlik was in California, trying his hand at a variety of odd 
jobs. He washed dishes. He painted houses. He repaired motorcycles. His oddest 
job, though, was helping engineer the defection of his parents, Vladimir and 
Maria. Once they obtained a vacation visa, as per Batlik's instructions, they 
followed the same route as their son -- take a left turn at Austria and don't 
look back. 
</P>
<P>
By early 1977, the Batliks had revolutionized their lives. After 2 1/2 years in 
Seattle, all three moved down the coast -- Jirka to El Toro, his parents to 
Long Beach. Vladimir and Maria still live in Long Beach, where they manage an 
apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
Batlik, meanwhile, gravitated to what he knew best. A plumber by craft, he 
eventually found work with the Balboa Bay Club, where he is now chief engineer 
in charge of maintenance. A paddler by expertise, he continued to compete in 
canoeing, barely failing to qualify for the 1984 U.S. Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
"The Olympics have always escaped me," he says with a touch of sadness. "In 
1980, I had a very good shot at making it, but because I wasn't in the United 
States for five years, I didn't have my citizenship. It was a Catch 22 -- if I 
was to make the (Olympic) team, I would have been granted citizenship, but at 
the trials, they wouldn't let you race unless you were a citizen. 
</P>
<P>
"In '84, I went to the trials and missed by 1/100ths of a second. And in 1988, 
I was the next one to go, an alternate. It's always just escaped me." 
</P>
<P>
Now 37, Batlik realizes he may never get there. But his wife, Shirley 
Dery-Batlik, has been there twice, in 1984 and 1988, and stands a good chance 
of returning. Sunday, Shirley won a gold medal in the 500-meter four-woman 
kayak and placed second in the 500-meter two-woman kayak. 
</P>
<P>
As he helps Shirley train for 1992, Batlik says he can't help indulging in a 
little whimsy himself. 
</P>
<P>
"We're starting to get five-ring fever," he says with a laugh. "We both sat out 
1989, but getting ready for the sports festival has given us the taste of it 
again. 
</P>
<P>
"About me in '92, who knows? Maybe for myself, it will be too difficult because 
of my age. Everybody says, 'You're too old to do this.' But physical age has 
nothing to do with it. Look at Martina. She got her ninth at Wimbledon. Great. 
And look at Mark Spitz. He's training and going for it again. More power to 
him." 
</P>
<P>
He grins. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it can happen to Jirka Batlik, too." 
</P>
<P>
Stranger things have happened. Batlik needs only look at his homeland and its 
recent democratization and the presidential election of popular, and Populist 
playwright Vaclav Havel. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I'd see it in my lifetime," Batlik says. 
</P>
<P>
Last Christmas, Batlik returned to Prague. It was the 14th anniversary of his 
defection and just days after the birth of the new Czech government. 
</P>
<P>
"Unbelievable," Batlik says. "It was just after they elected Havel as president 
and they had a hell of a celebration. It was one of the best New Year's I've 
ever had. I saw the happy faces there, I felt the hope they have. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be very difficult for them, but it's so much better than what 
they had." 
</P>
<P>
Batlik has seen it from both sides. No one has to tell him which way to paddle.

Michael Drummond, who received two artificial hearts and a third from a human, 
has died of multiple organ failure at age 30, nearly five years after he became 
the youngest person ever to receive the Jarvik-7 artificial device. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond died Saturday night of complications that included a blood infection, 
kidney failure and lung problems brought on by a combination of a diseased 
gallbladder and obesity, said Dr. Jack G. Copeland of the University of 
Arizona's Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, when his first artificial heart, a $15,000 plastic-and-metal 
cream-colored pump, was presented to the Smithsonian Institution's National 
Museum of American History, Drummond said: "I guess I am sort of a part of 
history, but not by choice. It's possible 100 years from now that the 
artificial heart will be as routine as a blood transfusion." 
</P>
<P>
Drummond and Copeland set medical history five years ago when Drummond became 
the youngest of six Jarvik-7 artificial heart recipients and the first to 
undergo an implant pending the availability of a heart from a human donor. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 29, 1985, he was given his Jarvik-7 after a viral syndrome had caused 
congestive heart failure and Copeland determined he had only 48 hours to live. 
</P>
<P>
After 9 1/2 days on the Jarvik heart, Drummond received the donor heart of a 
19-year-old Texas man who died in a motorcycle crash. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond recovered fully, despite a minor stroke while on the Jarvik, and led a 
normal life for 4 1/2 years, resuming work at a Phoenix-area grocery. 
</P>
<P>
But Drummond's condition had been deteriorating since Feb. 3 when he underwent 
emergency surgery to remove a gangrenous gallbladder. That ailment led to a 
blood infection, a blood clot in the lungs and a weakened heart that was 
replaced by a second artificial heart, which his body rejected. 
</P>
<P>
Copeland replaced Drummond's transplanted heart with a Symbion J-7-70 
artificial heart on May 21. Within two days of the second implant other 
complications developed, including fluid retention in the lungs and kidney 
impairment. 
</P>
<P>
Drummond, 6-foot-2, weighing 268 pounds with an engaging smile that offset a 
quiet, stoic demeanor, "certainly had the fight," said Lisa Slayton, a member 
of the university's cardio-thoracic intensive care unit's nursing team. 
</P>
<P>
She said the team had a good cry after his death. "We all took care of Mike 
like he was our brother. He was like family." 
</P>
<P>
Drummond's father, Clarence, said: "We're just grateful that the artificial 
heart was here for Mike the first time. He wouldn't have had the 4 1/2 years if 
he hadn't had (it). 
</P>
<P>
"And even this time, there were still things that Mike wanted to do, and with 
the artificial heart he had a shot at it, anyway. It didn't work out, but he 
had a shot at it."

INTENSE, FEISTY SCALIA GIVES HIGH COURT A SHARP EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four years ago, when Justice Antonin Scalia took his seat on the Supreme Court, 
observers quickly predicted that he would be the driving force behind a 
conservative revolution in American law. 
</P>
<P>
Quick-witted and intense, the former University of Chicago law professor 
dominated the debate in the panel's stately, column-ringed courtroom almost 
from the start. A prominent law magazine immediately dubbed the institution 
"Scalia's court," insisting that if the high court's sessions ever were 
televised, his name would become a household word. 
</P>
<P>
But now, as the high court's 1989-90 term comes to an end, Scalia seems more a 
force without followers. Rather than leading the court to the right, he has 
devoted much of the past year to berating his conservative colleagues for 
taking what he views as fuzzy or moderate positions. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps as a result, the stridence of Scalia's writing is attracting more 
attention these days than the substance of his arguments. 
</P>
<P>
"Scalia really had his fangs out this year," says Northwestern University law 
professor Lawrence Marshall, who recently served as a court clerk. "His 
dissents seem to say that 'if you don't agree with me, you must be out of your 
mind.' " 
</P>
<P>
"He's the most ideological of the conservatives," says University of Virginia 
law professor A. E. Dick Howard. But "he's also the most provocative, 
interesting figure up there." 
</P>
<P>
Examples of Scalia's blunt-spoken style abound: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the final day of last year's term, Scalia lashed out at Justice Sandra 
Day O'Connor for refusing to cast a decisive fifth vote that would have been 
needed to overturn Roe vs. Wade, the landmark abortion rights case. Her stated 
reasons for refusing to rule squarely on the right to abortion were 
"irrational" and "cannot be taken seriously," Scalia harrumphed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two weeks ago, he sharply criticized the court for taking on the issue of 
whether a comatose person has a "right to die" -- asserting that the answer is 
"neither set forth in the Constitution nor known to the nine justices of this 
court any better than . . . to nine people picked at random from the Kansas 
City telephone directory." Instead, Scalia wrote, since the Constitution says 
nothing about abortion or a right to die, "we should announce, clearly and 
promptly, that the federal courts have no business in this field." 
</P>
<P>
 -- In March, when Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist joined with the court's 
liberals to uphold a state law that banned corporations from running newspaper 
ads in support of political candidates, Scalia read an angry dissent from the 
bench: The government cannot use "censorship" to assure fairness in elections, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two weeks ago, Scalia again slammed his fellow conservatives for failing to 
enforce another clearly defined right: By a 5-4 margin, the court had ruled 
that an accused child molester does not have "an absolute right" to confront 
his accuser in court and, therefore, that child victims may testify via 
closed-circuit television. Scalia lectured the majority that the Constitution 
"with unmistakable clarity" grants defendants in criminal cases the right to 
face their accusers. For good or bad, he declared, "the Sixth Amendment 
requires confrontation -- and we are not at liberty to ignore it." 
</P>
<P>
Such onslaughts have given the 54-year-old Scalia a sure reputation as a 
zealot. "Rather than being a team player for the conservatives, he has taken on 
the role of the one who articulates the True Faith," says University of Chicago 
Law School Dean Geoffrey Stone. "He proselytizes for the faith, and (then) 
chides his colleagues when they fail to live up to it." 
</P>
<P>
For Scalia, the True Faith means adhering strictly to the words of the 
Constitution. The First Amendment says that the government may not pass any law 
"abridging the freedom of speech," so, in the recent ruling on flag burning, 
Scalia zealously protected the protesters -- to the dismay of conservatives. 
The Constitution also says that every person has a right to the "equal 
protection of the laws," so Scalia argues that any government preference for 
blacks or whites -- such as affirmative action programs -- is absolutely 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
On the bench, Scalia energizes the court debates. While several of his aging 
colleagues sit somnolently through the arguments, Scalia prods and pokes at the 
attorneys on both sides. At times, a quick question reveals his New York 
boyhood more than his Harvard law background. Earlier this year, as a lawyer 
spun out a long-winded argument to make a dubious point, Scalia looked 
agonized, then amazed. Finally, he simply couldn't hold back any longer. "Ah, 
come on. You can't be serious about that!" he exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
Although the justice's legal writings sometimes suggest an acerbic, even bitter 
man, Scalia after hours is warm, genial and outgoing. At parties, he is 
renowned for playing the piano and leading songfests. At the court, he jogs 
with his law clerks and greets court employees like old friends. One evening, 
several reporters spotted Scalia leaving the court in a tuxedo and teased him 
on his natty attire. "Ah, yes," he retorted, "esteemed jurist by day, man about 
town at night." 
</P>
<P>
The son of an Italian immigrant, "Nino" Scalia grew up in Queens, N.Y., a 
blue-collar neighborhood on Long Island that was home to TV's fictional Archie 
Bunker. A brilliant student, he was graduated at the top of his class at 
Georgetown University and Harvard Law School. After practicing law in Cleveland 
during the 1960s, he took a pay cut to teach -- first at the University of 
Virginia, then at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Scalia joined the Justice Department under President Gerald R. Ford. In 1981, 
then-President Ronald Reagan appointed him to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 
Washington. When Rehnquist was elevated to chief justice in 1986, Reagan tapped 
Scalia to be an associate justice. 
</P>
<P>
Scalia's supporters contend that the justice merely has attempted to fashion a 
clear, consistent intellectual approach to deciding constitutional cases. If a 
"right" is spelled out in the Constitution, Scalia says, the court should 
vigorously protect it; if not, the justices should stand back and let the other 
branches of government -- cities, states or Congress -- make the decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, however, his strict, literalist approach frequently pits Scalia 
against another of the court's better-known conservatives, Justice O'Connor, 
who takes a decidedly different approach. Like former Justice Lewis F. Powell 
Jr., O'Connor seeks to mete out justice and fairness, rather than ideology. Her 
opinions are balanced, nuanced, and -- at times -- confusing. Rarely is there a 
clear, firm declaration of her ideological views. 
</P>
<P>
These days, liberals hang their hopes on O'Connor's passion for balance. But to 
conservatives such as Scalia, her moderation is a cause for outrage. "My guess 
is that he is disappointed in her," says Washington attorney Alan B. Morrison, 
a longtime friend of Scalia. "He probably thought he could persuade her to go 
further" in restricting abortion or affirmative action, Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
But Morrison, among others, questions why Scalia routinely attacks O'Connor so 
directly. "It's hard to fathom how that will help his cause," he says. Harvard 
law professor Laurence H. Tribe, who frequently argues before the court, 
agrees. Tribe says that Scalia's domination of the debates "seems to irritate 
some of the other justices. I also think his shooting from the hip and aiming 
at the egos of his colleagues, has not endeared him to them," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
In an opinion last year in Croson vs. Richmond, for example, O'Connor argued 
that because the equal-treatment guarantee in the Constitution protects whites 
and blacks equally, the city of Richmond could not set aside 30% of its city 
contracts for black entrepreneurs. But O'Connor went on to say that affirmative 
action might be permissible in an "extreme" case if it were the only way to 
make up for blatant exclusion of blacks in the past. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Scalia left no room for any such doubts. In a separate statement, 
he attacked O'Connor's opinion as muddled and said that the court should rule 
clearly that official racial classifications of any sort were unconstitutional. 
He also forecast -- correctly -- that the court opinion was so ambiguous that 
it would simply spur more litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, perhaps, the interpretation of O'Connor's decision depended on the 
eye of the beholder. Conservative lawyers contended that her opinion marked the 
end of affirmative action efforts by state and city governments; civil rights 
lawyers said that it did no such thing. 
</P>
<P>
Unintentionally, perhaps, Scalia's dissent on the child-molester case placed 
him squarely in the same corner as the court's three liberals. And that was not 
the first time: He joined with them last year -- and again last month -- to 
rule that the right to free speech protects protesters who burn an American 
flag. 
</P>
<P>
"The liberals don't give him credit where it's due," says Richard Bernstein, a 
Washington lawyer and a former Scalia clerk. "He obviously has no love for 
child-molesters or flag-burners, but he has a love for the language of the 
Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
But Scalia's rigid interpretation of the Constitution frequently places him on 
the opposite side from the liberals. Over the last 25 years, the high court's 
dominant liberal bloc created broad legal doctrines out of simple words in the 
Constitution. For example, the right to "liberty" was interpreted to mean that 
individuals have a right to privacy, that women have a right to abortion, and 
-- now -- that all Americans have a right to refuse life-sustaining medical 
treatment. Scalia would reverse all of these doctrines because they are not 
based on clearly spelled-out constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
For Supreme Court lawyers who would like to present a tidy half-hour argument 
and then sit down, Scalia's intense interest comes as a mixed blessing. "You 
know you are going to have to confront Nino," said one attorney who appears 
before him regularly. "You have to prepare for him," he says.

Most likely, attorneys will have to prepare for Justice Scalia for many years 
to come. If there is a voluntary retirement age for Supreme Court justices, it 
comes about age 80. And for Antonin Scalia, the energetic intellectual of the 
conservative bloc, his 80th birthday will come during the year 2016.

QUOTATIONS FROM JUSTICE SCALIA: On the "right to die": 
</P>
<P>
"The point at which life becomes 'worthless', and the point at which the means 
necessary to preserve it become 'extraordinary' or 'inappropriate' are neither 
set forth in the Constitution nor known to the nine Justices of this court any 
better than they are known to nine people picked at random from the Kansas City 
telephone directory. . . . I would have preferred that we announce, clearly and 
promptly, that the federal courts have no business in this field." 
</P>
<P>
On the "right to abortion": 
</P>
<P>
"I continue to believe...that the Constitution contains no right to abortion. 
It is not be found in the long-standing traditions of our society, nor can it 
be logically deduced from the text of the Constitution. Leaving this matter to 
the political process is not only legally correct, it is pragmatically so. . . 
. The court should end its disruptive intrusion in this field as soon as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
On witnesses in child-molestation cases testifying via television: 
</P>
<P>
"The Sixth Amendment provides, with unmistakable clarity, that 'in all criminal 
prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the 
witnesses against him.' That face-to-face presence may, unfortunately, upset 
the truthful rape victim or abused child, but by the same token it may confound 
and undo the false accuser, or reveal the child coaxed by a malevolent adult. 
We are not free to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of clear and explicit 
constitutional guarantees and then to adjust their meaning to comport with our 
findings. For good or bad, the Sixth Amendment requires confrontation and we 
are not at liberty to ignore it."
