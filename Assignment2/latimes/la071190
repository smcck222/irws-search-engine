L. RON HUBBARD'S CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have just completed reading the last report on Scientology (six-part series, 
Part A, June 24-29). I find an applicable equation of thought progression 
reflected. Simply stated: An idea never leaves its source. This means that an 
idea will be reflected in all the outcomes it generates, whenever it is 
applied. The Church of Scientology is a reflection of the man who founded it: 
L. Ron Hubbard. His fragile ego and sense of external threat is mirrored in the 
elaborate defenses he seemed to think were necessary to protect himself. 
Hubbard built himself and his church on the thought forms of fear and 
defensiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Fear and threat pervade the very fabric of the scriptural structure of the 
church. The supreme irony of fear-motivated behavior is that it creates the 
very fears which seem to motivate it. Hubbard, fearing that he was being spied 
upon and criminally invaded, used burglary and bugging as a defensive tool in 
response. Out of a sense of persecution, Hubbard, and his church, sought to 
persecute; out of a sense of threat, they became threatening, and no lie or 
deceit was too outrageous a vehicle to protect and perpetuate Hubbard's 
"Truth." 
</P>
<P>
The method of dealing with the Church of Scientology, however, is not to 
condemn, but instead, to understand, and ultimately, forgive. Those who wish to 
give pain only do so because they are in pain; my responsibility to someone in 
pain is to give succor and release through forgiveness. It is only in this way 
that the church and its basic "fear-motivated" scriptures can begin to reflect 
the idea that there is nothing to fear, and nothing to defend against, and, 
therefore, no reason to attack and threaten. Perhaps if the climate of 
suspicion and anger could be extricated from the church doctrines and 
supplanted with the idea of forgiveness and mercy, all the good ideas Hubbard 
ever had may have a chance to do what, but for his fears and self-doubts, he 
might have accomplished: to, at last, really help someone.

WATER WATCH; 
</P>
<P>
SAVINGS PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hey, Southern California -- Congratulations! Average water use throughout the 
region has dropped significantly, thanks to you. 
</P>
<P>
In the last couple of months, ever since it became clear that we're well into a 
fourth year of a drought, voluntary conservation efforts slashed consumption to 
an impressive 15.5% below standard levels in Los Angeles and to 15.8% below in 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County, less pinched because of an underground reservoir, reduced its 
water use by an average 8%. 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Water District this year told Southern California communities 
that a 10% savings is needed over the short run to compensate for predicted 
shortfalls in water. 
</P>
<P>
How did we do it? 
</P>
<P>
In some communities, bans on hosing down driveways and daytime lawn watering 
have helped water districts stave off the forced rationing they feared would 
become necessary. Only a few districts, such as Santa Barbara, have instituted 
rationing. 
</P>
<P>
Many more have chosen to keep the issue of conservation alive by making 
customer cutbacks mandatory. Los Angeles is considering just that course of 
action now, but opponents of Mayor Tom Bradley's mandatory conservation measure 
are pointing to the success of the voluntary program to justify their 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
That's shortsighted: The area's water shortage is a long-term problem. 
Voluntary conservation can help. But in some areas of the state it won't be 
enough.

OUT OF SYNC WITH HONESTY; 
</P>
<P>
CANNED POP MUSIC AT A CONCERT? AT LEAST WARN THE TICKET BUYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lip-syncing at a live concert? Canned music? Madonna, say it isn't so! Fans 
dish out plenty for a pair of tickets to see their favorites perform live -- 
not to watch an entertainer mouth the words or sing along to a recorded beat. 
</P>
<P>
Few artists own up to this imitation of life. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to music critics and industry publications, lip-sync 
perpetrators include Milli Vanilli, New Kids on the Block, Paula Abdul, Janet 
Jackson and Madonna (she is said to "lip sync" at least one song in her current 
tour, "Blond Ambition"). 
</P>
<P>
We think there ought to be a law. Fortunately, several are in the works. 
Assemblyman Bob Epple (D-Norwalk) plans to introduce in January a 
truth-in-advertising bill that would require public disclosure by artists who 
use prerecorded music in concerts. The measure would also require warnings in 
radio and newspaper ads promoting artists who use recorded music. Similar 
legislation is pending in New York and New Jersey. A disclaimer is only fair. 
</P>
<P>
Some promoters defend such technical sleight of hand. They say fans don't 
complain. But if fans really wanted to see lip-syncing they could stay home and 
watch music videos and save themselves a bundle. If they wanted to hear 
recorded music, they could buy the CD or turn on the radio. Concerts billed as 
"live" should be just that -- live. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe we're naive to expect straight-dealing from the concert promotion 
business. And maybe some concert-goers don't care if they pay to hear a tape. 
But those who buy a "live" concert ticket ought to at least know what they're 
buying. Then the consumer can decide whether to beware or be there.

L. RON HUBBARD'S CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times and staff writers Joel Sappell and Robert Welkos have done a 
commendable public service with the series on Hubbard and the Church of 
Scientology. 
</P>
<P>
While not as blatantly destructive as the Rev. Jim Jones' Peoples Temple, the 
Church of Scientology is nevertheless a threat to American society. 
</P>
<P>
Scientology has tried to justify and protect itself by citing the 
constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion. Freedom of religion does not 
include the freedom to exploit, deceive or harass others.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to thank The Times for the free publicity for the Church of 
Scientology. This advertisement must have cost several hundred thousand 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
I am a mechanical engineer working in a Fortune 100 company, and have been a 
Scientologist only a short while (just over two years). However, I have 
improved so much in just these few months that I wish I had at least heard of 
Scientology earlier in my life. 
</P>
<P>
Some of my gains have been in the area of communication skills which is the 
backbone of everything that we do, everyday. I have also become very innovative 
and have filed several patents since that time. This is an ability that I did 
not think I had. My affinity for others has gone up tremendously. I can also 
see other people's point of view which makes me a very fair person indeed. I 
have become such a role model at work that people with four times as much 
experience as me come to me for advice, on not only work-related matters but 
also personal issues. I can think very clearly without any sidetracks. I feel 
great, and have never been happier in my life. I owe it all to Hubbard, his 
discovery of Dianetics and Scientology, and the correct application of his 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
Your articles will have a positive impact by generating interest and curiosity 
among readers. Eventually they will want to know more and will stop by a 
Scientology organization and sign up for services.

Your series on Scientology shows how tyrants emerge. We see in Scientology many 
of the elements of far more powerful dictatorships: Cults of personality, with 
strong emphasis on the "sacred writings" of the leader. 
</P>
<P>
Enrichment of a select few at the top. Disregard of normal standards of public 
decency, with critics being denounced as enemies and hounded or attacked 
without mercy. A mind-set that exalts supporters as superior to the rest of 
humanity. And permeating all, a vindictive self-righteousness that seeks to 
turn ordinary people into mere fodder for the use of The Movement. 
</P>
<P>
In America, our laws and traditions of liberty put bounds on the growth of 
Scientology and its like, and limit the harm they do. But in nations ruled by 
dictators, similar cults or movements break all such bounds, raising quite 
ordinary people -- akin in their way to Hubbard -- to the status of gods. Every 
society has its people, troubled or naive, who are susceptible to the 
blandishments of people such as Hubbard. That is why they continue to come 
forth. But in such movements, we see the early beginnings -- fortunately 
well-controlled -- of processes that in other lands have led to Ayatollah 
Khomeini and Tian An Men Square.

DOWN IN THE DUMP AND MAKING THE BEST OF IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA BLANDFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most of us know about dumps. They are hidden places where mangy dogs and slimy 
rats, scavengers and pariahs roam by moonlight. By day, they are picked over by 
human scavengers and pariahs, crones with carbuncled skin and leering voices. 
On a list of social desirability, dumps come somewhere between prisons and 
sewage plants, and calling them "landfills," or "land reclamation schemes," 
does nothing to change the fact that they are dumps, and full of garbage, 
preferably sitting on our neighbors' water supply, not our own. 
</P>
<P>
The Azusa dump is in the desert -- or would be had man not tinkered with the 
San Gabriel Valley. It is a fitting site: the scapegoat, laden with man's sins, 
is driven out into the desert to perish. Only, there is no perishing; just the 
threat of poisons leaking into our future, of plastic liners and promises that 
the hot, fermenting jumble of yesterday's trash is not tomorrow's death. 
</P>
<P>
Picture the trucks rattling off the 210 and 605 freeways toward this hapless 
place. A line forms outside the dump, waiting in the dry, brackish back streets 
of Azusa. It is a rather jolly line. Truck drivers call out to one another. 
There is a comradeship in garbage. Timid outsiders in small, disintegrating 
pick-up trucks arrive bearing leftovers from an old kitchen or garden work. 
They soon melt into the clubbiness of the day. 
</P>
<P>
What is missing? Sea gulls. Where are the usual wheeling, plummeting hunters 
dragging chicken bones from beneath old hospital needles? Where is the smell? 
What is a dump without that festering whiff to curdle the strongest stomach? 
Where are the women? 
</P>
<P>
This is a man's place. Some time warp has captured this entrance on Vincent 
Street: men, big, brawny, little, hacking coughs, sweat-glued hair, in cowboy 
heels, sneakers, with large hats, young men, old men, enjoying the idea of 
being with MEN. 
</P>
<P>
It is a postcard from Marlboro country, from life before cholesterol. 
Somewhere, in the distant spires downtown, six lawyers toil on behalf of the 
Azusa Land Reclamation. They go to court, they file, they counter: The talk is 
of aquifers below the 302-acre rock quarry, of 36 million more tons of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
But at the dump, the talk is of the workers' softball team, of practice, of 
their planned outing to Magic Mountain, of coffee and doughnuts for the 
drivers. The dump is home; it is family, a family of men drawn together in the 
freedom of work they love. Enormous yellow machines, like lumbering dinosaurs, 
crush and crumble all before them, never slowing, never cringing. "It's in a 
man's genes to do a manly thing like this -- it's a calling," says Ralph 
Chavira. "I look on this landfill as one of my kids -- it's an emotional 
thing," says Rick Spencer, the manager. 
</P>
<P>
Rick's grandparents were poor farmers in Kansas. His father brought in oil 
wells when Rick was a child. Now he teaches positive attitudes in the federal 
penitentiary in Ft. Leavenworth. "A very amazing man, my father. He believed in 
a lot of very good hard work." Rick dropped out of college three times and was 
working in a chicken slaughterhouse when a notice caught his eye for a highway 
construction technology course at Ferris State College in Michigan. He found a 
calling: big machinery, heavy equipment, sludge disposal, chemical 
"management," the inexorable might of man. 
</P>
<P>
He hates Los Angeles and pines for the Midwest, which he sums up by its gas 
stations: "First you pump, then you pay." But he has found his dominion on the 
shaking, decomposing garbage of the Azusa landfill. He prides himself on how 
few men quit working here, on the way they cover the garbage over each night, 
on the methane gas wells, so precisely calibrated, on the "spotters," the men 
who pull up weeds and set bird feeders in the perimeter hedges for the hawks 
and pheasants. 
</P>
<P>
His hands are clean. It is other men who throw away paint cans and batteries 
that bleed toxics, who toss out reams of computer paper, who destroy leftover 
toys and clothes, thousands of dollars' worth, lest -- heaven forbid -- the 
needy get them free. He sees our sins as he sees our cruelty: the transients 
who tumble out of garbage trucks, scooped up from the dumpsters where they 
slept, cold and crazed. 
</P>
<P>
Rick recalls his grandfather saying: "People who were alive 200 years ago are 
all dead today. You have to die comfortable with the way you lived your life." 
He likes the neat community of garbage he has built: cleanly swept and watered, 
acre by acre, buried and forgotten. Occasionally, he drives up into the 
mountains and looks down: "Nothing you can see forever but lights and cars." 
And he hates what he sees. 
</P>
<P>
Back East, a landfill charges $100 a ton to take in garbage. Here, Rick Spencer 
has had to roll back prices from $22.50 to $19.25 -- as if the whole of 
California is ripe for dumping and using and never asking where nor why. 
</P>
<P>
Good American garbage: alive and ticking in 200 years' time.

BOATS LOOK FOR ALBACORE TO KEEP GETTING CUSTOMERS

The albacore aren't going to come to the fleet, so the fleet is going after the 
albacore. 
</P>
<P>
The Predator, out of H&amp;M Landing in San Diego, returned Tuesday from a 1 
1/2-day exploratory run, which proved fruitless, according to Bill Dowling at 
the landing. 
</P>
<P>
Dowling said skipper Mark Hall did encounter a school of bluefin tuna but added 
there were no hookups. Hall did not say where he was fishing. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has spotted any (albacore)," Dowling said. "We've been looking at all 
the other long-range boats that are coming in (from the other landings), and 
none of them have brought any albacore back." 
</P>
<P>
The Seabisquit, out of Islandia Sportfishing, will embark on a two-day 
exploratory run late Saturday night. Asked why, owner Bob Hodgden replied: 
"Economics, I guess. We need the fish." 
</P>
<P>
Hodgden said he will work an area not fished by the long-range boats returning 
up the Baja California coastline. "I'm going to try it farther outside, more to 
the west of those people," he said. "Hopefully . . . who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
With yellowtail fishing having slowed substantially in recent days, such runs 
are going to be necessary if the fleet is going to find the popular tuna and 
maintain an adequate flow of customers. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to look for them to find them," biologist Michael Laurs said of the 
albacore. Laurs, a migratory species expert with the National Marine Fisheries 
Service, said he has had few reports of albacore from San Diego skippers, 
mostly because there has been little effort by the fleet, which has been 
content fishing the offshore kelp paddies for yellowtail. 
</P>
<P>
Laurs did offer a bit of optimism, however, claiming that the body of albacore 
that made a brief showing in early May could show again any time. 
</P>
<P>
"That body of fish will eventually show up in the Southern California Bight 
again," he said. "Based on all the tagging studies, once the fish get into the 
bight, they remain for the remainder of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Laurs said a few albacore are starting to show several hundred miles off the 
coast near Mendocino, adding that they are heading toward the coast off the 
Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
While sport fishermen on the coast have for the most part stopped fishing for 
white sea bass off Santa Catalina Island, anglers living on the island have 
found the fish are still there. The bite continues to be strong, but it's in 
the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
"There's fish in there and they're big ones," said John Cadman, 36, a resident 
of Avalon. Cadman said he and friends have been battling fish regularly after 
midnight in an area near the rock quarry, just outside the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people don't realize that these things will bite in the middle of the 
night," he said, adding that the biggest so far is a 50-pounder caught by Larry 
Mebust, a commercial fisherman who normally targets swordfish. 
</P>
<P>
"He heard there were a lot of sea bass, and the swordfish bite has completely 
shut off, so he decided to take a little break," Cadman said. "He came in here 
and got a 50-pounder." 
</P>
<P>
A similar bite is reportedly occurring on the backside of the island near the 
isthmus, Catalina and Shark harbors. 
</P>
<P>
"They've been catching some pretty big ones themselves, 30- to 40-pounders," 
Cadman said. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>

FISHING REPORT: ANGLERS' MUSE IS EVOKED BY CATCHES AT IRVINE LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Catfish provide some of the best prospects of summer, and with 2 1/2 tons 
stocked in Irvine Lake last week, the fish are there for the taking from the 
reservoir's many coves. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Morris of Montclair, fishing with cut mackerel in the Santiago Flats 
area, netted a 12 1/2-pound fish as part of a large stringer. Three five-fish 
limits that totaled 27 pounds were weighed in by Garden Grove's Dave, Sue and 
Dylan Winning. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE MEAD -- Striped bass still active in lower basin, most weighing less than 
six pounds. Anchovies at 40 feet best bet. Other species slow. 
</P>
<P>
BULLHEAD CITY -- Striped bass biting in river, most under six pounds. Catfish 
active in shallows, mainly in coves. Mackerel best bet. Trout slow. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CACHUMA -- Trout providing almost all the action, biting at 40 feet on 
needlefish lures. Best at west end. Catfish fairly active in shallows, biting 
primarily on mackerel. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CASITAS -- Catfish active throughout lake, feeding on mackerel at five 
feet. Leonard Gibson, Oak View, 10 catfish, average four pounds. Curtis and 
Brad Brooks, Oak View, 11 catfish. Trout caught at 50 feet with needlefish 
lures. Tom Stallings, Ojai, 3 1/4-pound trout. Largemouth bass slow. 
</P>
<P>
LAKE CASTAIC -- Catfish active on upper lake, biting on most baits in shallow 
water. Frank Ferraro, nine-pound catfish, upper lake. Bill Bonelli, Newhall, 
11-pound catfish. Largemouth bass bite fair in upper lake, but most fish small. 
Steve Chi, Los Angeles, seven-pound bass, caught on plastic worm. Lower lake 
yielding mostly crappie and small largemouth bass. 
</P>
<P>
KERN RIVER/LAKE ISABELLA -- Several limits of pan-sized rainbows taken from 
river. Power Bait, salmon eggs and crickets most productive. Crappie still 
active off points and coves of lake. Largemouth bass between two and five 
pounds fairly active off Rocky Point, hitting plastic worms and crank baits.

JACK SMITH: OURS HAS BECOME THE LANGUAGE OF THE NATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We all know that English is a crazy language, a truth popularized by Richard 
Lederer in his recent book, "Crazy English" (Pocket Books). 
</P>
<P>
Allan Paul of Costa Mesa sends an excerpt from Writer's Digest in which Lederer 
notes that English is the most widely spoken language in the history of our 
planet, has the largest vocabulary of all the world's languages (perhaps as 
many as 2 million words), and is, in a word, crazy. 
</P>
<P>
Among many anomalies, he points out that we have words to express certain 
things or ideas only when they don't exist. "Have you ever seen a horseful 
carriage, or a strapful gown? Have you ever rubbed into someone who was 
combobulated, sheveled, gruntled, plussed, chalant, ruly, gainly, maculate, 
pecunious or peccable?" 
</P>
<P>
"But still," he concedes, "you have to marvel at the unique lunacy of the 
English language." 
</P>
<P>
How difficult English is for foreigners is illustrated in "English Well 
Speeched Here" (Price Stern Sloan), a booklet called to my attention by Jane 
Wyatt. 
</P>
<P>
Compiled by Nini Lo Bello, it gives examples of signs, in English, seen around 
the world. For example, a sign in a Norwegian cocktail lounge: "Women are 
requested not to have children in the bar." A sign outside a clothing store in 
Brussels: "Come inside and have a fit." In a Florence shop window: "Dresses for 
Street Walking." A Rome laundry suggests: "Ladies, leave your clothes here and 
spend the afternoon having a good time." A Zurich hotel advises: "Because of 
the impropriety of entertaining guests of the opposite sex in the bedroom, it 
is suggested that the lobby be used for this purpose." Equally moralistic is a 
sign in Germany's Black Forest: "It is strictly forbidden on our Black Forest 
camping site that people of different sex, for instance, men and women, live 
together in one tent unless they are married with each other for that purpose." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, adman Stephen Baker, whose native language is Hungarian, 
extols English as the language of the angels in a Writer's Digest article sent 
me by Meredith Brucker. "No other language is like it," he says. "Nothing even 
comes close to it in sound, eloquence, and just plain common sense." 
</P>
<P>
Illustrating the versatility of English, he notes that in Hungarian jumpers 
could only ugri (jump). In America, they can leap, hop, vault, spring, bound, 
bounce, caper, prance, buck, trip, bob, skip or even go hippity-hop. 
</P>
<P>
I won't say all those words are exact synonyms for jump, but you get the idea. 
He points out that we have no academy to enforce standard English on us. We are 
free to invent and enlarge and change. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, in this country the line between 'correct' and 'colloquial' speech 
has become so blurred as to be nearly imperceptible to all but the most 
consummate wordsmiths." (Well, everyone to their own opinion about that.) 
</P>
<P>
I especially agree with Baker that "the free and uninhibited use of the pronoun 
you in English pretty much stands alone among speakers of the world. Americans 
should feel fortunate to be so blessed." 
</P>
<P>
He notes that the French, Dutch, Scandinavians and Russians have at least two 
second person pronouns, one familiar, one unfamiliar. Germans have three, 
Italians have four, the Spanish five and the Portuguese 20. 
</P>
<P>
I am well aware of how important this distinction is, at least in French. Once 
I referred to my French daughter-in-law's younger sister as tu, instead of 
vous. She seemed embarrassed; my wife and my daughter-in-law were shocked. I 
didn't know what I had done wrong. My wife explained to me that one uses the 
pronoun tu only for persons with whom one is very familiar. 
</P>
<P>
"Vivid in my memory," Baker recalls, "is the resounding slap meted out by my 
high-spirited Hungarian girlfriend who felt that my switching to the familiar 
te after a single perfunctory kiss at the door was just a bit premature." 
</P>
<P>
As for our you, he says, "Those born and raised here rarely appreciate the 
impact of this unassuming but handy little word. Quite possibly you represents 
one of the cornerstones of democracy. Because of it, cabdriver or passenger, 
celebrity or ordinary citizen, worker or manager all converse on the same level 
playing field." 
</P>
<P>
Baker urges his fellow immigrants to learn and use their new language. "Sure, I 
nurture my memories from the 'old country.' Like everyone else, I enjoy waxing 
nostalgic to my children. But I do so in their native language. Which happens 
to be English. And you know something? My stories flow better." 
</P>
<P>
American English may be the ideal language of the free. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, you -- Mr. President -- read my lips!

DR. NEIL SOLOMON: POLLEN ALLERGIES

<TEXT>
<P>
Question: Hay fever runs in my family. However, when I get together with my 
brothers, sisters and cousins, I find that we all have different reactions. 
</P>
<P>
Since we all have hay fever, we all live in the same neighborhood, and we're 
all exposed to the same air, why do we have different reactions? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Not every hay fever patient is affected by every type of pollen. 
Patients will react only when the particular tree or weed to which they are 
sensitive is pollinating. For example, very allergic individuals may be 
troubled with hay fever over a period of months, while others may be bothered 
for only a few weeks. Those sensitive to a particular allergen may experience 
hay fever symptoms for only a relatively brief period. 
</P>
<P>
Although you and the other members of your family live in the same 
neighborhood, you are not necessarily allergic to the same pollen, and this 
accounts for the difference in symptoms.

OPERATION DRUMBEAT The Dramatic True Story of Germany's First U-Boat Attacks 
Along the American Coast in World War II by Michael Gannon Harper &amp; Row 
$24.95, 490 pages 
</P>
<P>
"Men, I have opened our Operation Order," says the intrepid young submarine 
commander to his eager crew in Michael Gannon's "Operation Drumbeat." "We are 
going against America. Our first destination is New York." 
</P>
<P>
At such moments, "Operation Drumbeat" presents itself as a kind of 
retro-techno-thriller, a World War II version of "The Hunt for Red October." 
Like that best-selling novel, "Operation Drumbeat" is a ripping good yarn of 
submarine warfare, espionage and geopolitics. The difference is that "Operation 
Drumbeat" is not a novel -- it is a work of revisionist history that strips 
away nearly 50 years of official propaganda and popular misconception about the 
strategy and tactics of Nazi submarine warfare in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Gannon reveals the truth about Nazi Germany's first submarine campaign 
against the United States in the days and weeks after America finally entered 
the war -- "a series of U-boat attacks on the United States so severe and 
extensive, and so appallingly undefended," the author writes, "that . . . they 
constituted an 'Atlantic Pearl Harbor.' " Five U-boats penetrated American 
waters, sank 25 ships and sailed in triumph back to their bases in occupied 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Gannon tells the larger story of "Operation Drumbeat" by focusing on the 
exploits of a single German submarine, the U-123, and its 28-year-old captain, 
Reinhard Hardegen, on the first patrol by a Nazi submarine flotilla in the 
coastal waters of North America. Supplied only with tourist brochures hastily 
obtained from local libraries, the five U-boats in "Operation Drumbeat" managed 
to reach within a few hundred yards of the American coast -- Hardegen gazed at 
the Ferris wheel at Coney Island from the tower of his submarine while his crew 
was treated to the local broadcast of an episode of "The Goldbergs." 
</P>
<P>
According to Gannon, the scandal behind Operation Drumbeat is that British 
intelligence, which had broken the German naval codes, was tracking the 
progress of U-123 and the other submarines across the Atlantic: "Perhaps more 
no more telling attack warning, in unmistakable language and numbers, had ever 
come to the military forces of the United States," Gannon writes. But the U.S. 
Navy did not manage to do anything about it. And, in any event, the author 
suggests that the "dented shields and virgin swords" of American coastal 
defense were unequal to the task of defending against Hardegen and what Gannon 
is moved to call "a proud and daring war machine." 
</P>
<P>
Gannon is a professor of history at the University of Florida -- and, more 
important, a war buff -- and he has clearly engaged in long, meticulous and 
fruitful research into original (and, in some cases, unexamined) sources. He 
demonstrates a mastery of obscure points of military history and technology; 
for instance, he writes with expertise and enthusiasm on the superiority of 
Captain Hardegen's M IV/1T Carl Zeiss 7x50 binoculars over equivalent equipment 
supplied to Allied naval officers. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, "Operation Drumbeat" is packed tight with facts that will come as a 
surprise to most readers. Despite what we've seen in countless war movies, for 
example, World War II-era submarines did not spend much time under water: The 
U-boats ran and fought on the surface, where their diesel engines were able to 
operate and their deck guns could be brought to bear, saving the battery-driven 
electric motors for the rare occasions when they were forced to dive to avoid 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
Best of all is Gannon's narrative of submarine warfare as it was experienced by 
the men of U-123 and the sailors who were their victims. Gannon is a 
high-spirited story teller who is not afraid to make noises in print: 
"Dacca-dacca-dacca-dacca" is how he renders the sound of a machine gun. And he 
has a love of language that sometimes overwhelms his careful scholarship -- for 
example, at the opening of Chapter 7, the author succumbs to a persistent 
lyrical impulse in a paragraph so ornate I had to stop to read it twice. 
</P>
<P>
More troubling is the fact that Gannon is so smitten by his subject that he 
cannot resist lionizing Hardegen and the crew of the U-123. The author 
concedes, rather too delicately, that the German Navy was "an armed force in 
service to objective evil" -- but he insists that it is wrong "to paint a swath 
of guilt across the name of every German who went to sea." Gannon concludes: 
"It would miss the truth that most officers and ratings went to sea for Navy, 
not for Nazi, reasons." 
</P>
<P>
I am afraid this distinction is too subtle for me, and I found myself a little 
horrified at how the author urges us, almost subliminally, to cheer the 
successes of U-123 against Allied merchant ships and their crews. But it is 
proof of Gannon's power as a writer that I came so close to joining him in 
these unwholesome cheers.

China Club Jams On: Contrary to an item in Monday's Morning Report, the China 
Club's legendary Monday night Projams are still alive and well. 
</P>
<P>
The action has never stopped, but the players have changed, said club publicist 
Joe D'Ambrosio. Jim Ehinger and the Nasty Survivors were moved to Thursday 
nights to make room for the Kal David Band, which performs at the Projam on 
Monday nights. Kal David, former member of the Fabulous Rhinestones, is known 
to invite his friends to perform. Recent friends who have dropped by include 
Stevie Wonder, Keith Emerson, John Entwistle, Jeff (Skunk) Baxter, Joe Walsh 
and Sam Kinison. GREG BRAXTON and BETH KLEID

'COSBY,' 'CHEERS' GIVE NBC RATINGS VICTORY

NBC's mighty Thursday night schedule carried two summer shows into the top five 
last week. Ratings released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. demonstrated anew 
that the drawing power of "The Cosby Show" at 8 and "Cheers" at 9 is sufficient 
to keep viewers hooked on the NBC shows around them -- in this case a pilot 
called "Blossom" and a repeat episode of the Jerry Seinfeld sitcom that debuted 
earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
They helped NBC eke out the narrowest of victories over ABC. NBC averaged a 9 
rating for the week, compared to 8.9 for ABC and 7.6 for CBS. Collectively, the 
three networks attracted only 54% of the prime-time audience for the week -- 
meaning nearly half of all viewing was being done on Fox, independent stations, 
cable or VCRs. The full list of ratings is on F10. 
</P>
<P>
* Charles Kuralt didn't get big ratings with his Fourth of July special -- the 
show ranked 56th among the week's 86 prime-time programs -- but it was still 
the program of choice at 10 that night. Kuralt attracted viewers in about 6.3 
million households, compared to about 6.1 million for a "Quantum Leap" rerun on 
NBC and about 4.7 million for a "China Beach" repeat on ABC.

EMERSON QUARTET OPENS FORD SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To open what has become one of our most civilized and welcome summer rituals, 
Chamber Music at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre, the Emerson String Quartet 
on Monday offered a cohesive but risk-filled program of works by Mozart, 
Shostakovich and Schumann. 
</P>
<P>
The risks had to do with how much introversion the outdoor venue would tolerate 
and project, what with the omnipresent freeway noise, the rowdy blue jays, the 
helicopter overflights. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the breezes that can waft the song of the big rigs right into your ears 
were flowing in the opposite direction, and the jays ceased their squabbling 
with the first Mozartean downbeat (the sunset helped, too). The helicopters, 
alas, visited on no fewer than five occasions. 
</P>
<P>
The Emersons -- violinists Eugene Drucker and Philip Setzer, violist Lawrence 
Dutton, cellist David Finckel -- proved equal to all comers, playing with their 
characteristic purposefulness, expertise and, on this occasion, dramatic punch. 
The often weepy, close-to-the-vest Mozart Quartet in D Minor, K. 421, was 
delivered with uncommon speed (the first movement for once taken at the allegro 
clip demanded) and rhythmic tension. 
</P>
<P>
Shostakovich's relatively genial, underemphatic Ninth Quartet -- note how this 
composer has come to occupy what used to be the Bartok spot on the program -- 
might seem an equally chancy work for the outdoors, but not in the Emerson's 
grippingly taut, impeccably detailed and, finally, theatrical reading. 
</P>
<P>
Schumann's A-minor Quartet is the sort of extrovert material ideally suited to 
the surroundings, but here, ironically, there were problems. 
</P>
<P>
The moonstruck adagio was taken at a pace sufficiently slow to approach 
inertness, while the finale was such a headlong dash that its innate friskiness 
was trampled in the rush to the finish -- a remarkably clean-textured finish, 
nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Bartok appeared at encore time: the pizzicato movement of his Fourth Quartet, 
played with wit and relish.HERBERT GLASS

'WHEELS OF TERROR' A REAL FENDER-BENDER ON USA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Wheels of Terror," which premieres on USA cable tonight at 9, owes its soul to 
"Duel," "The Car" and "Christine," plus a little something to "Terminator" and 
"Alien" and lots to demolition derbies and bumper cars everywhere. And in the 
final confrontation, there's some "Godzilla Meets the Smog Monster." 
</P>
<P>
OK, you may laugh at the plot: The driver (we never see him) of a lurking, 
skulking black 1974 Dodge Charger has been grabbing little girls and raping 
them around Copper Valley, Ariz. Then Laura (Joanna Cassidy) shows up with her 
daughter Stephanie to get away from urban violence. Laura hires on to drive the 
yellow school bus -- which just happens to be stocked with a souped-up engine 
for lack of spare parts. 
</P>
<P>
As written by Alan B. McElroy and directed by Chris Cain, the movie starts out 
eerily enough with Jay Gruska's portentous musical rumblings. But there's no 
character development nor much plot outside of the race to the inevitable 
battle to the death between the surly Charger, which now has Stephanie, and the 
school bus, with Momma's flaming red hair whipping in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
No buckling up for safety here. They ram and slam each other across Arizona, a 
lot of it in slo mo. We never find out what makes the Charger so mean. All 
we're left with is incredible respect for how much beating a Dodge can take. 
Let's see some Japanese import do that. Lee Iacocca can stand tall. IRV

THROUGH THICK AND THIN, THEIR TIES ENDURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In the midst of the Great Depression, the YMCA offered programs to get kids off 
the streets, offering them organized sports and activities to keep them 
occupied and out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
One of those groups was the Friendly Indians, begun in 1925 in southwest Los 
Angeles as a club for 9- to 12-year-olds. On Tuesday, 14 of its members held 
their annual reunion at a Lake San Marcos home, marking the 65th anniversary of 
the club's founding. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were young, the group gave us a sense of identity," said Lloyd Olson, 
one of the members who now lives in the Los Angeles suburb of Rolling Hills. 
"It was like the gangs today, except we had an exceptional leader that kept us 
out of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the club evolved into a core group of 25 high school boys, its 
name changed to Alpha Kappa Alpha in keeping with the tradition of university 
fraternities. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the club members came to the group after losing their fathers in 
World War I. 
</P>
<P>
"For many of us (who) didn't have fathers, this was our family," said Lloyd 
Anderson, whose father died during the Great War. "We served each other in that 
capacity. The fact that the wives all got along helped keep us together, too." 
</P>
<P>
Although World War II sent the men on their separate ways -- all of them 
serving in either the Army or Navy -- they kept in touch with the help of a 
monthly newsletter, the AKA Scandal Sheet, published by a member's father. 
</P>
<P>
After the war -- with three Purple Hearts but no casualties among them -- most 
members stayed in the Southwest, and many return for Christmas and Easter 
reunions. 
</P>
<P>
They have met each year since 1946 without interruption, despite deaths and 
separations. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are closer than brothers," said Olson's wife, Virginia. "If any of 
them had any troubles, these guys hung together and saw him through it." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the original Friendly Indians, there were no particular events that 
formed the ties binding these men. Rather, the circumstances that brought them 
together as Depression-era children keep them together as adults. 
</P>
<P>
With most of them retired and in their 70s, the men still manage to gather 
every Easter, usually with children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren in 
tow, to reopen scrapbooks filled with black-and-white photographs and newspaper 
clippings. 
</P>
<P>
"These reunions become more and more important to us," said Harold Mantle. "As 
people become infirmed and lose a mate, they need the spirit and consolation of 
the group." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "When one of us (dies), you begin to feel the realities of life. As 
we get older, we begin to treasure the friendship that we didn't pay much 
attention to when we were younger."

SCHOOLS OK MORE PORTABLES TO EASE CROWDING; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: CITY DISTRICT SAYS ANOTHER 20 ARE NEEDED ON TOP OF 28 BEING BUILT, 
AS ENROLLMENT CONTINUES TO RISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At least 20 more portable classrooms -- in addition to 28 already being built 
at a cost of $1.5 million -- will be needed this fall by the San Diego city 
school district because the projected number of new students continues to 
increase beyond forecasts made earlier this spring. 
</P>
<P>
School board trustees voted Tuesday to solicit bids for the additional 20 
portables so that construction could begin by Aug. 1 for completion by Nov. 1, 
which still more than a month after most of the district's 179 facilities open 
for the 1990-91 school year. 
</P>
<P>
District planners estimate the number of new students will be more than 3,100 
above the 118,600 now enrolled. Earlier, the district projected an additional 
2,000 students for this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The move for new stop-gap measures to handle severe crowding came as trustees 
heard pleas Tuesday from the Mid-City and Scripps Ranch/Mira Mesa communities 
for short- and long-term solutions to the student crunch in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
Implementing the complete list of recommendations might run as much as $120 
million to $140 million, Trustee Jim Roache estimated. 
</P>
<P>
That figure would be in addition to the $50 million or more already sought by 
residents in the Southeast and Paradise Hills areas of San Diego, who presented 
their laundry list for new schools in February. 
</P>
<P>
"We may have created expectations out in the communities that we can't meet," 
said Roache, referring to the lack of money to build facilities to handle 
growth through the year 2000, beyond those already planned or under 
construction as a result of a successful June, 1988, bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
Schools Supt. Tom Payzant said his staff will take the newest reports, along 
with those submitted in February, and return to trustees in September with the 
recommendations, ranked in priority for any money that becomes available. 
</P>
<P>
Board President Kay Davis suggested that administrators explore the possibility 
of another bond issue next year. The district might be able to place another 
measure on the ballot, which would need only a 50% plus-one majority because 
the district has unused taxing authority approved by voters in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The two reports presented Tuesday call for more funding and space at Wilson 
Middle School in Mid-City, a new middle school to augment Wilson, a new 
elementary school in City Heights, reconstruction of Hamilton Elementary, new 
cafeteria facilities at Wagonheim Junior High in Mira Mesa, a new middle school 
in Scripps Ranch, along with more portables and various school boundary changes 
to ease short-term crowding. 
</P>
<P>
Payzant said he will come back with recommendations on a few of the ideas by 
month's end so they can be implemented in September if approved by trustees. 
</P>
<P>
Among the plans: transfer of Central Elementary's fifth-grade classrooms -- now 
at Wilson -- back to Central this fall, elimination of an optional attendance 
zone between Wilson and Mann middle schools, boundary changes between Mason and 
Hickman and Jerabek and Miramar Ranch in the Mira Mesa/Scripps Ranch area, and 
transfer of students of Miramar Naval Air Station dependents to the new Hage 
Elementary School, from Walker and Mason elementaries. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the board approved $4 million in similar short-term fixes for 
students in Southeast San Diego, including busing sixth-graders from Sherman, 
Brooklyn and Balboa elementaries to MacDowell Elementary in Clairemont, a 
school closed several years ago because of low enrollment in that area. New 
portables were also placed at several schools.

BURBANK EXTENDS AIRPORT LAND-USE CURBS FOR 2 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Burbank City Council on Tuesday extended for nearly two years development 
restrictions on land around Burbank Airport, part of a plan to convert the area 
to cleaner industries. 
</P>
<P>
By a unanimous vote, the council extended an interim development control 
ordinance passed in May to buy time for city planners to make permanent zoning 
changes and formulate a general plan for the 1,000-acre area, stretching 
roughly from the airport to the Golden State Freeway between Empire Avenue and 
Cohasset Street. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance affects nearly all of the 300 acres to be vacated by Lockheed 
Corp., which announced in May that it will pull much of its operation out of 
Burbank by the mid-1990s. The departure of other firms that are dependent on 
the aerospace giant for business may make even more land available. 
</P>
<P>
City planners view the available land as an opportunity to re-create the 
northwestern corner of Burbank, which has been dominated by Lockheed since 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Although many speakers at Tuesday night's council meeting supported the goal of 
attracting cleaner industries, they urged a speedier decision on permanent 
planning changes. 
</P>
<P>
Council members originally approved the ordinance on May 29 for 45 days. At the 
end of that time, they were required to extend it, amend it or discontinue it. 
Tuesday's vote extended the ordinance to June, 1992, but requires a second 
review and vote by the council within six months. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents and businesses -- including Lockheed itself -- have criticized 
the ordinance because it may frighten new firms out of locating in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance requires new projects in the area to go through the planned 
development process, which includes hearings before the planning board and the 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
That way, city officials can manage development in the area while they create 
formal controls. Without the planned development process, projects inconsistent 
with the city's plans theoretically could have slipped through, Community 
Development Director Bill Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
In response to tougher state and federal environmental laws, Burbank officials 
hope to phase out polluting heavy industries. Tentative plans call for a 
commercial center with retail outlets concentrated along the Golden State 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed spokesman Ross B. Hopkins said Tuesday that the ordinance "sends the 
wrong signal to the business community. It says Burbank is not interested in 
creating jobs and bringing revenue to the city."

COUNCIL SPARS OVER PRIVATE MEETING ON GROWTH-CONTROL ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego City Council's daylong growth-control session Tuesday began on a 
terse note when Mayor Maureen O'Connor questioned whether a city consultant had 
unwittingly "tainted" the city's proposed growth-control ordinance during a 
recent meeting at Councilman Bob Filner's house. 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor touched off a round of verbal sparring with Filner when she directed 
City Atty. John Witt to determine if Robert Freilich, a Kansas City-based 
attorney who advises the city in growth issues, had discussed specific parts of 
the city's still-evolving growth-control document at the invitation-only 
meeting at Filner's house. 
</P>
<P>
That meeting, which Filner described as an offshoot of a previous meeting that 
was funded by a state grant, was attended by a small number of 
environmentalists, developers and representatives of minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
Filner said the group that met at his house discussed "city policy . . . we 
weren't talking about any specific projects." 
</P>
<P>
After Tuesday's council meeting, Freilich denied he had discussed anything 
other than general policies and issues in the growth-control arena. 
</P>
<P>
Filner described the meeting as "far more productive than the session you 
(O'Connor) chair in City Council." Filner also told O'Connor he would continue 
to hold "discussions on that (growth-control) policy with as many people and as 
diverse a group that I can get together." 
</P>
<P>
Filner then described O'Connor's request for a city attorney investigation as 
an attempt to "intimidate members of City Council" by restricting their right 
to freely discuss important issues with the public. 
</P>
<P>
But O'Connor maintained that, although the meeting "might have been kosher . . 
. in this business, appearance is everything. . . . I'm not going to sit here . 
. . and say it's OK for a half-dozen people to have exclusive, intimate 
conversations with our consultant when everybody else . . . was not invited." 
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's suggestion that a small group of citizens is receiving special 
treatment prompted Councilman Bruce Henderson to complain that, increasingly, 
"very important matters" are being decided at the City Council with little 
public input or council debate. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing comments O'Connor made Monday during the council's stormy redistricting 
session, Henderson suggested that, during several recent votes, "suddenly, five 
votes appear (and) there is little if any public discussion . . . because 
obviously the matter was decided in private in some fashion best known to the 
participants." 
</P>
<P>
But Henderson, like O'Connor, stopped short of alleging any violations of the 
Brown Act, which generally prohibits council members from making decisions in 
private. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't accuse anyone here of violating the Brown Act," Henderson said. 
"But I certainly feel that a number of things have happened, particularly in 
the past three or four months, that have violated the spirit of the Brown Act." 
</P>
<P>
When the council finally opened its meeting to gather public testimony, members 
heard from dozens of San Diegans with opinions on the two emergency ordinances 
that are designed to limit the impact new development will have on the city's 
already strained transportation network. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinances, which are scheduled for a council vote next Tuesday, would set 
annual limits on residential, commercial and industrial projects that can be 
built. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinances also would tie new development to a long-term public works 
program that is designed to provide public services needed to maintain San 
Diego's much talked about "quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
However, development industry representatives, who Tuesday described the 
ordinances as a building cap, threatened to subject council's actions to a 
court challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"We do oppose the emergency ordinances or taking any action until all 
information is in your hands," said Chamber of Commerce spokesman Mel Katz. 
"The need for an emergency ordinance has not been established in compliance 
with the City Charter." 
</P>
<P>
Developers maintained that the slowing economy already has slapped growth 
controls on San Diego. For example, Katz said, the 6,235 building permits 
issued during 1989 represented "the lowest number since the recession in 1982." 
</P>
<P>
Katz maintained that most of the 4,521 permits issued so far during 1990 came 
during a flurry of activity in January when "talk of growth ordinances" once 
again surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Construction Industry Federation argued that there is no 
basis for an emergency ordinance, an opinion echoed by at least two council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why we should be enacting this ordinance as an emergency," 
Councilman Wes Pratt said. "I don't think there's going to be an emergency next 
week" when the council is slated to vote on the two ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
"There clearly is an emergency, however, it's a political emergency," said 
Councilman Ron Roberts, who argued that the City Council should not rush an 
unfinished ordinance into existence. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development Tuesday, the Coalition for San Diego gave a 
preliminary report on the study it is funding to determine the economic impact 
on fees associated with the city's proposed growth ordinances. The coalition is 
a self-appointed civic and business group that opposes development caps. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary data suggests that the fees would make it economically unfeasible 
to build many commercial and industrial projects, according to Mac Strobl, a 
coalition member. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results of the study suggest "very few projects would work (from an 
economic perspective), particularly if you add proposed regional fees to the 
city's fees," Strobl said. "The least affected would be single-family homes . . 
. but industrial and commercial would be significantly more affected."

County Environmental Health Services workers are spraying a neighborhood near 
the Tijuana River this week in an effort to reduce the mosquito population and 
prevent an outbreak of diseases the pests carry. 
</P>
<P>
The sprayings, which began Tuesday night and will continue through Thursday, 
will take place along the riverbed east of 19th Street in Imperial Beach to the 
international border and also in the Robinhood Homes subdivision, said Gary 
Stephany, the health department's deputy director. 
</P>
<P>
Health officials decided to conduct the sprayings after catching a large number 
of mosquitoes in traps, including the species that sometimes carries malaria 
and encephalitis, said Moise Mizrahi, a department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"One small trap produced upwards of 1,000 mosquitoes," Mizrahi said. 
</P>
<P>
No cases of disease have been reported in the area, Stephany said. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood has been sprayed during each of the past four summers, partly 
because mosquitoes breed particularly well in the river valley, Mizrahi said. 
</P>
<P>
Stephany described pyrethrins, the insecticide that will be used in the 
sprayings, as "relatively harmless" to humans and warm-blooded animals. 
</P>
<P>
"Because a few people may have an allergic reaction to it, persons in the areas 
being fogged should stay indoors during the process," Stephany said. "It is 
recommended that pets, including birds and fish, be kept inside or covered." 
</P>
<P>
The sprayings will occur between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. each of the three days, if 
weather permits, Stephany said.

BUST NETS MAJOR SUSPECT IN DOWNTOWN HEROIN TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
San Diego police Tuesday morning arrested a 30-year-old man they believe is one 
of downtown's biggest heroin traffickers, putting a dent in the local drug 
scene for at least a couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
"But as word gets out . . . someone else will pick up the ball and run with 
it," said Sgt. Gordon Redding at a press conference. "I'm sure there are some 
dope dealers at 12th and C who couldn't make their connections today." 
</P>
<P>
Julio Lucero, of the 1400 block of Front Street, is being held at the County 
Jail on suspicion of heroin possession, possession of heroin for sale and an 
outstanding 1988 warrant for dealing heroin. Augustina Perez Moreno, 21, of the 
same Front Street address, is being held on suspicion of possessing of heroin 
and possessing heroin for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Police seized $2,285 in cash, some syringes and 103 multicolored balloons each 
stuffed with three-tenths of a gram of Mexican brown heroin during their early 
morning raid of the Front Street studio apartment, said Detective Bill Graham. 
</P>
<P>
The ballons, which are called quarter balloons because they usually sell for 
$25 each, have a street value of about $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
Police ran a chemical test on the heroin at the station. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've got some pretty good stuff here," said Graham, who was involved 
in the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Police believe many of the balloons were headed for drug deals in the area on C 
Street between 11th and 12th streets, a place police describe as the one of the 
hottest spots for narcotics activity in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, when officers from the Fugitive Apprehension Unit forced open the 
door of the Front Street apartment Tuesday morning, they weren't expecting to 
make a drug bust. They had been tracking Lucero because he was a fugitive who 
was wanted on an outstanding 1988 felony warrant. 
</P>
<P>
"We were looking for him strictly as a fugitive and just sort of popped in 
there at the right time," Redding said. Police said the arrests were made 
without incident, and no weapons were confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
When police entered the apartment, the heroin balloons were in a clear plastic 
bag in plain view, and, with the help of Nero, a police dog, other heroin 
balloons and cash were sniffed out from their hiding places around the 
apartment, Redding said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said that finding Lucero was easier than they thought because a Chevy 
Impala registered in his name was parked outside the apartment.

MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO MAIL FRAUD IN OIL WELL SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Encino man who operated a company that sold hundreds of investment shares in 
wells it falsely claimed were actively producing oil pleaded guilty Tuesday to 
mail fraud, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Gaston Stanford, 42, pleaded guilty to three counts of mail fraud in U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles and faces up to 15 years in prison and $750,000 
in fines, Assistant U.S. Atty. Terree Bowers said. Stanford is scheduled to be 
sentenced Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford and Anthony Colagreco, 32, also of Encino, ran a telemarketing firm 
called American Southwest Petroleum Ltd. in West Los Angeles, which solicited 
oil investors from across the country, Bowers said. 
</P>
<P>
Bowers called ASP a "boiler room" operation and said that in the summer of 1985 
about 350 people paid $2,400 to $3,000 each for shares in two oil leases in 
Kansas and two in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the wells on the leases were not producing oil at all," Bowers said. 
"They actually purchased some producing wells at the start, but then they 
started drilling their own wells and got into problems." 
</P>
<P>
Bowers said that although the wells on three of the leases were producing only 
water and no wells had been drilled on the fourth, potential investors were 
told that the leases were producing oil. 
</P>
<P>
Some investors received some money back on their investments along with 
fictitious oil production reports, Bowers said. The money they received, 
however, was actually from new investors in the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
ASP collapsed in late 1985 and was investigated by a task force of prosecutors 
and investigators from the U.S. Attorney and Los Angeles County district 
attorney's offices. The investigators learned that some of the money taken in 
the scam was allegedly used by Stanford to make speculative investments in the 
commodities market, Bowers said. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford and Colagreco were indicted in May of this year on 19 counts of mail 
fraud. Colagreco has pleaded not guilty and is scheduled for trial next week.

JUDGE TO HEAR POLICE TAPES OF BELLINGER'S COMPANIONS; 
</P>
<P>
MURDER CASE: THE COURT WILL USE THE TAPED INTERVIEWS TO ASSESS WHETHER THE 
WITNESSES HAVE CHANGED THEIR ACCOUNTS OF THE SHOOTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Pasadena Juvenile Court judge will listen to taped police interviews of three 
teen-agers who witnessed Joey Paul Bellinger shoot two deaf brothers in a 
Granada Hills parking lot to determine whether the witnesses have changed their 
accounts of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Sandy R. Kriegler, who must decide whether Bellinger should be tried in 
Juvenile Court or as an adult, said Tuesday that he will review tapes of the 
original police interviews with three friends of Bellinger's. 
</P>
<P>
Bellinger is charged with murder and attempted murder for fatally shooting 
Cesar Vieira, 30, and wounding Edward Vieira, 25, both of Palmdale, during a 
confrontation between the brothers and a group of Bellinger's friends on Jan. 
28. 
</P>
<P>
During the fitness hearing that began Monday, three of Bellinger's friends who 
witnessed the shooting, after a traffic argument, said Bellinger fired in 
self-defense, as the brothers charged toward him. 
</P>
<P>
Before he fired, the teen-agers said, Bellinger screamed at the brothers to get 
back and fired a warning shot into the air. They also said another teen-ager -- 
who has been missing since the incident -- screamed at Bellinger to shoot the 
brothers. 
</P>
<P>
These accounts differ from earlier accounts released by police, which suggested 
that Bellinger fired without provocation or encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
Kriegler decided to listen to the tapes to assess the credibility of the 
witnesses. Prosecutors suggested that the teen-agers may have changed their 
stories to protect their friend, but defense attorney Gerald L. Fogelman and 
the witnesses themselves said they may have left out some details in talking to 
police because they were nervous. 
</P>
<P>
One teen-age witness, Inna Spivak, testified Tuesday that when police 
interviewed her, they cut her off and seemed uninterested in the context of the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't care about what happened," she said. "They released a lot of lies 
in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
The events preceding the shooting are critical to determining whether Bellinger 
will be tried as an adult or as a child because one of the factors the judge 
must consider is the gravity of the offense. 
</P>
<P>
If Bellinger fired in self-defense, that could be viewed as a mitigating 
factor, lessening the seriousness of the crime and improving his chances to be 
tried as a juvenile, which would limit the maximum sentence to nine years in 
custody of the California Youth Authority. Prosecutors want to try Bellinger as 
an adult, which would expose him to a possible sentence of 25 years to life.

PORT TO REVIEW JANITORIAL CONTRACT AFTER FIRINGS; 
</P>
<P>
LABOR: OUSTED AIRPORT WORKERS PRESENT LAUNDRY LIST OF COMPLAINTS AGAINST 
COMPANY THAT TOOK OVER THIS MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Former janitorial workers at Lindbergh Field won a mild reprieve from the San 
Diego Unified Port District on Tuesday, as the Board of Port Commissioners 
agreed to review the contract of the Houston-based firm that fired most of the 
crew after assuming airport cleaning operations July 1. 
</P>
<P>
However, commissioners said, the ex-employees probably won't be rehired after 
being fired by World Service Co., which came under vicious attack at Tuesday's 
meeting, not just from the ousted employees but from members of the board. 
</P>
<P>
By unanimous vote, the six commissioners present voted to review the entire 
operation and company history of the firm and to decide at their Aug. 7 meeting 
whether, in the words of one member, to "undo" the contract. 
</P>
<P>
World Service came under attack from Eliseo Medina, president of Local 102 of 
the Service Employees International Union, a branch of the AFL-CIO, which 
represents the workers. Medina cited problems that World Service has 
experienced in its contracts to clean the international airports in Los Angeles 
and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, he said, World Service was not registered with the state to do 
business in California, a fact confirmed by a World Service spokesman who 
attended the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Cheered by the largely Latino delegation that showed up to protest the 
company's action, Medina said workers were fired without cause, even though 
many had worked at the airport for more than a decade. He criticized the 
company as being anti-worker and anti-union. 
</P>
<P>
World Service was awarded the contract after Port District officials said they 
received complaints about the cleanliness of the airport. The previous 
contractor was Menzies International California. 
</P>
<P>
Several workers complained Tuesday that Menzies had not received the backing 
from a cost-conscious Port District to buy the supplies to get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
"Often," one woman said, "we were asked to clean with water and paper towels. 
Under the circumstances, we did the best we could." 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Mrozewski, vice president of World Service, came under intense scrutiny 
at the meeting from Commissioner Lynn Schenk, who chastised the firm for firing 
employees "without giving them even the courtesy of individual interviews." 
</P>
<P>
Schenk, who voted against the hiring of World Service when the contract was 
awarded, said she felt the board had acted hastily in securing the contract 
"when we did not have sufficient background information." 
</P>
<P>
"And now, I have serious questions about who we're doing business with," she 
said. "As a public agency, we have a responsibility to treat employees fairly 
and equitably. I don't have much concern for the union, but I do have concern 
for treating people fairly. 
</P>
<P>
"The offhanded manner by which this company interviewed these people as a 
group, without giving them the dignity or the courtesy of individual 
interviews, offends me on many levels." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Mrozewski had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. George Stevens appeared at the meeting on behalf of Rep. Jim Bates 
(D-San Diego), who Stevens said is "troubled" by the Port District's record in 
affirmative-action hiring. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said that, of 65 janitorial employees, only 10 have been retained by 
World Service. But Mrozewski said World Service had retained 22 of the former 
janitorial employees. 
</P>
<P>
"Even so," Stevens said, "that's 40-something people unemployed. These people 
have been in trouble with the National Labor Relations Board, and the 5th 
Circuit Court of Appeals, and they admitted that today. Somebody with the port 
just didn't do their homework, and now they've got a mess on their hands." 
</P>
<P>
Maurice A. (Bud) McDonald, manager of Lindbergh Field, praised World Service, 
saying the company represents a "marked improvement" over previous janitorial 
contractors, and that he is "thrilled" with its work.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: DEL MAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 16-year-old Del Mar boy died of massive internal injuries after a car in 
which he was riding slammed into a tree. The driver, another 16-year-old boy 
from Del Mar, was arrested at the hospital on suspicion of felony drunk driving 
and manslaughter, said a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol in 
Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
The driver's name was not released because he is a minor. He was also 
hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey James Foote, who was one of three passengers, died at 6:15 a.m. Monday 
at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, about six hours after the accident, 
said Jerry Bohrer of the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
Bohrer said the four were traveling west on Via de la Valle, west of La Gracia 
at about 75 m.p.h. when the driver went off the road and broadsided a tree. 
</P>
<P>
"It was with such force that the passenger door was pushed into the car 2 1/2 
feet," Bohrersaid. He said that Foote, sitting in the front passenger seat, 
took the brunt of the impact and was pinned inside the car. 
</P>
<P>
The other passengers, 16-year-old Ruben Gutierrez and 16-year-old Kevin Kirby, 
both of Solana Beach, were taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital in Encinitas. 
Kirby was treated and released Monday, and Gutierrez was discharged from the 
hospital Tuesday, a hospital spokesman.

MAGEE TAKES VOWS AFTER TEAM BOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was not an exchange of vows beneath crossed bats at home plate. But had the 
game lasted any longer, Verdugo Hills Coach Kelly Magee would have needed a 
justice of the peace, not an umpire. 
</P>
<P>
Magee was married on June 30, a few hours after his American Legion District 20 
team lost to Sun Valley, 3-2, on a run in the ninth inning. Although Magee 
wasn't happy that Verdugo Hills lost, he certainly was glad the game didn't go 
into extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get it started by 10, but we didn't get going until about 11:30," 
he said. "I was a little upset (about the delay)." 
</P>
<P>
Why the hurry? Because Magee, 30, was cutting things closer than a bang-bang 
play at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
Since the game ran long, Magee didn't get home until 2:30 p.m., and he had a 
wedding rehearsal scheduled at 3. The actual ceremony was held in La Canada at 
5. 
</P>
<P>
Magee said his bride-to-be raised no objections concerning the unusual 
doubleheader, even though the game ended scant hours before the big event. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she didn't mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Always nice to meet someone who has her priorities straight. 
</P>
<P>
Road warriors: Panorama City Coach Scott Smith figured it was a stroke of 
genius. Play a couple of interdistrict games in Las Vegas on Friday and a 
scheduled District 20 game at Lancaster the following day. 
</P>
<P>
Shoot, Lancaster is right on the way home, too. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought it was a great idea at the time," said Smith, who admits his 
players weren't as high on remaining in the high desert. 
</P>
<P>
"When we got to Lancaster, the kids were all saying, 'Coach, do we have to play 
this today?' There's no way we'll do that again." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe it wasn't such a bad idea. Panorama City (14-5) reached a season high in 
runs with a 17-12, 16-hit win over Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
Great balls of ire: Pete Redfern had one of the best offensive performances of 
his American Legion career at Chatsworth High when he was a player for Sylmar 
in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
He went five for five while starting in center field on the same diamond where 
he now coaches the Legion entry from Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake, however, Redfern was always a pitcher first -- the 
right-hander was an All-American at USC and toiled for the Minnesota Twins -- 
which could be why his Legion team's pitching woes sometimes drive him nuts. 
Chatsworth (9-10) is batting a solid .313, but the staff earned-run average is 
6.22. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them and tell them, but I guess they don't listen," Redfern said. 
"Strikes are the name of the game." 
</P>
<P>
In 141 innings, Chatsworth pitchers have issued 120 walks and hit five batters. 
The 10-run mercy rule has been invoked three times and Chatsworth has 
surrendered 127 runs in 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
Left-hander Danny Rodriguez, who was 6-2 in the spring for City Section 4-A 
Division champion Chatsworth High and had an ERA of 2.58, has walked 36 batters 
in 30 2/3 innings of Legion play. He walked 34 in 57 innings of high school 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
No relief: First-year North Hollywood Coach Mel Williams knows too well that 
his team's record is 1-20, the worst in District 20. Obscured by an 
unattractive win-loss percentage, he says, are several near-victories. 
</P>
<P>
Against the district's best. 
</P>
<P>
Eight times North Hollywood has taken a lead into the final inning and lost. 
North Hollywood has thrown scares into some of the area's best teams -- 
including Van Nuys-Notre Dame, Panorama City, Reseda and Sun Valley -- before 
faltering down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't seem to make a difference who we bring in," Williams said. "The 
starters usually do OK, and then we bring in another one of our starters and 
they don't do well at all. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're scrappy, we're young. I'm proud of them. We hung right in there with 
some of the best teams around."

Katie Beck is ready for serious cycling. 
</P>
<P>
The question is, is it ready for her? 
</P>
<P>
Tana Curtis, cycling coach at the U. S. Olympic Festival, pauses to consider 
the question. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, you've heard the expression, 'They broke the mold when they made them'?" 
Curtis says. "Well, in Katie's case, she was free-formed." 
</P>
<P>
Beck, 17, has a personality that, to put it tactfully, is unique. The Olympic 
Festival could be considered a fairly important event in the life of someone so 
young, but if Beck was nervous during the competition over the weekend at the 
U.S. Olympic Festival she veiled it well. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds before the start of a race, she continued to blab away to anyone who 
would listen. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you how many times I've been told to shut up before a race," Beck 
says. "People have different ways of preparing themselves. I race better when 
I'm relaxed and having a good time." 
</P>
<P>
Opponents don't seem to know quite what to make of her. She goofs around, then 
leaves them gasping on the track. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thinks I'm not serious, that I'm just loud and obnoxious," says 
Beck, a senior-to-be at Simi Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis, who worked as a coach in the Amateur Athletic Foundation's cycling 
program, remembers the first day Beck showed up at the Encino Velodrome. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the kids were pretty timid," Curtis says. "Some of them had never been 
in competition on a bike before, let alone on a track with no brakes and the 
whole works. Most of them were shy. Not her." 
</P>
<P>
Curtis recalls wondering how long Beck's enthusiasm would last, and whether it 
would carry over to racing. 
</P>
<P>
She no longer has to worry. 
</P>
<P>
Beck was entered in six events at the Olympic Festival. In all, she raced 15 
times, more than any other junior woman. 
</P>
<P>
Though her only medal -- a gold -- came in the team trials, Beck placed high in 
several individual events against senior riders. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the race is on the road or a track doesn't matter to Beck, who has 
raced everything from a BMX to an old, beat-up 10-speed she found rusting at a 
junior high school near her home. 
</P>
<P>
Top racers at the senior level tend to specialize in a few events, but Beck has 
put off choosing. 
</P>
<P>
"I like them all," she says. 
</P>
<P>
At home, she often rides through the back roads of Simi Valley, Moorpark and 
Thousand Oaks on her way to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
The trips are part of her training, but she says they also are an enjoyable way 
to pass the time. 
</P>
<P>
"She rides in many ways like a guy," Curtis says. "She's got that 
aggressiveness. You can see her jaw set and it's like, 'Uh-oh, here she goes.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Like a guy? Funny that Curtis should put it that way. 
</P>
<P>
Beck grew up playing with the guys. Adopted just a day after she was born, Beck 
grew up with her adoptive mother's three older daughters, an adopted older 
brother, an adopted younger brother and various foster children -- most of them 
boys. 
</P>
<P>
"There were really no girls in the neighborhood," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Beck rode dirt bikes in the hills near her home. She played tackle football. 
</P>
<P>
And she kept on playing tackle football -- even at Simi Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
Beck played for the Pioneers as a freshman and sophomore. She says she was a 
two-way starter at wide receiver and cornerback on the freshman team and a 
part-time player on the junior varsity the next season. 
</P>
<P>
She attained celebrity status as the only girl on the team, but decided to give 
it up when the boys started to get bigger and she stayed the same size. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to save my knees for cycling," she says. 
</P>
<P>
And the rest of her body as well. Some opponents weren't too fond of the idea 
of a girl playing football. A few let her know about it. In one game, Beck 
says, she was attacked by several members of the opposing team. 
</P>
<P>
"They were like, 'Get that girl!' " Beck says. "They didn't care what else was 
going on. They just wanted to beat me up. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really scared. About five of them jumped on me and just started wailing 
on my face. I couldn't even breathe." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, an official broke up the scuffle. 
</P>
<P>
But the same tenacity Beck showed in competing with the boys in football also 
benefits her on the cycling track. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been times in the last couple of days that she's been dead tired, 
but refused to give up," Curtis says. "She was just about to drop out in the 
points race and something clicked inside her. It was like, 'I'm not going to be 
lapped.' 
</P>
<P>
"That switch is so important. It has to be there if a kid is going to be a 
top-level athlete. Katie has it. She'll pass out before she'll quit." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday afternoon she almost did. Beck had just sat down to rest after a 
sprint race when she looked up and saw the field for a points race taking off. 
</P>
<P>
Without time to make the appropriate mechanical adjustments on her bike, Beck 
chose to race in the 15-kilometer event anyway. 
</P>
<P>
She stayed with the lead pack, and even led one sprint, but she felt dizzy and 
barely managed to hang on during the last five laps. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the race, Beck collapsed with heat exhaustion. It marked the 
third time in four days that her health had been at risk. 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, during practice at the National Sports Center Velodrome at 
Blaine, Minn., Beck ran into a spectator who had wandered too close to the 
track. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he was looking at the grass or something," Beck says. "My shoulder hit 
his and I went all over the track." 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, during a sprint race, Beck's bike lost traction and she slid 
down the track, injuring her other shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the trainer and they said, 'What sport are you in, softball?' 
Everyone thinks I must be in softball because it's my arms that are beat up." 
</P>
<P>
Softball is just about the only sport she hasn't tried in the past few years. 
She seems set on cycling, which is good news for the United States, Curtis 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"She's got power, she's got strength and she has speed," Curtis says of Beck. 
"She's been cursed by talent. She'd better not give it up."

DIGEST: FORMER SIMI VALLEY COACH JOINS CLU FOOTBALL STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dave Murphy, a former Simi Valley High football coach, will join Joe Harper's 
Cal Lutheran staff as a part-time assistant and will coach the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy is one of several coaches Harper has hired to fill out his eight-man 
staff. Wayne Quigley, an assistant at Calabasas High; Bob Misko, an assistant 
at Royal High; and Broderick Jackson, an assistant at West Los Angeles College 
also will be part-time assistants, Harper said. 
</P>
<P>
In six years as Simi Valley coach, Murphy led the school to its only Marmonte 
League football championship. He had a 21-40-1 record and resigned after the 
1989 season. Murphy will share offensive-line responsibilities with Harper. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy will continue to coach the Simi Valley girls' basketball team and teach 
at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Northridge has received an official letter of confirmation from the 
NCAA approving the school's reclassification from Division II to Division I in 
all sports except football. 
</P>
<P>
The letter from NCAA membership coordinator Shirley Whitacre to Northridge 
President James W. Cleary states that the school's request for reclassification 
has been approved, effective Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The university also announced that Paul A. Bubb has been hired as director of 
athletic development, effective Aug. 6. 
</P>
<P>
Bubb, 33, comes to Northridge from Drake University, where he was director of 
athletic development and alumni relations in 1988-89. Before that, he was 
director of development at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, from 
1985-88. 
</P>

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: CLARK SIGNS WITH TIGERS FOR ESTIMATED $500,000 
</P>

<P>
The Detroit Tigers say they have signed their No. 1 draft pick, Tony Clark, for 
a bonus estimated at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
Clark, drafted second in the nation out of Christian High School in the June 
free agent draft, will be able to honor his basketball scholarship at the 
University of Arizona and still would collect his bonus if he is injured 
playing that sport, team officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the deal, he will play three seasons with the Wildcats and can enter the NBA 
draft after any season at Arizona. He will be able to play for a Tigers' minor 
league team in mid-May, missing the next three spring trainings. 
</P>
<P>
"After three years, we hope Tony will be able to move up to the majors," said 
his father, Arthur Clark. 
</P>
<P>
The bonus was the largest ever given to a high school player, said Tigers 
General Manager Bill Lajoie. 
</P>
<P>
Clark hit .500 with 11 home runs in 44 games his senior year at Christian. 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers have come to contract terms with wide receiver Nate Lewis, a 
seventh-round draft choice from Oregon Tech, General Manager Bobby Beathard 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
No details of the agreement were released. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, 5-feet-11 and 197 pounds, was the third of four Charger picks in the 
seventh round and the 187th player selected overall. He caught 27 passes for 
434 yards in eight games. He transferred to Oregon Tech after being dismissed 
from Georgia for academic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
He is the third of 17 Charger draft choices to agree to terms. The others are 
outside linebacker Jeff Mills, a third-round choice from Nebraska, and wide 
receiver Elliott Searcy, a 12th-rounder from Southern. CURT HOLBREICH

Dow Jones &amp; Co.: The publishing and communications company reported that 
second-quarter income plunged 28% to $34.9 million, although revenue rose 0.9% 
to $442 million. The New York-based company, which publishes the Wall Street 
Journal, said earnings were down partly because of increased interest and other 
expenses related to the acquisition of Telerate.

profit totaled $38.2 million, down 9% from the same period last year. Revenue 
rose 3% to $273.8 million. The company said a 3% increase in income from its 
hotels was offset by a 21% decline in income from its gaming operations.

DOW SLUMPS 23.27 IN LATE PROGRAM TRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Times Staff and Wire Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
Stock prices tumbled in the final hour of trading Tuesday as weakness in the 
bond market and a lower dollar triggered a flurry of computer-driven sell 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrial stocks fell 23.27 to 2,890.84. 
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by nearly two to one in nationwide 
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 529 up, 969 down and 498 
unchanged. Big Board volume came to 147.63 million shares, up from 119.39 
million Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Metz, market strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said the dollar's 
steep drop against the Japanese yen and weak bond prices scared stock traders 
by prompting concern that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten 
monetary policy to boost the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Tighter policy would drive the cost of money higher, hurting businesses and, in 
turn, stock and bond prices. 
</P>
<P>
While the market treaded water most of the day, sell programs kicked in late in 
the session. "We suddenly got whipped with a real heady amount of program 
selling, and the market of course has been running quite thin," said Gene Jay 
Seagle, analyst at Gruntal &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
The sell programs accelerated profit taking that already was under way, said 
Peter Vandenberg, a trader with Shearson Lehman Hutton. 
</P>
<P>
Stock highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* Pitney Bowes tumbled 6 3/8 to 43 1/2. The office machine company announced 
that analysts' earnings expectations for the second quarter were too 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
* On the other side of the earnings outlook, International Paper rose 1 1/8 to 
52 3/4 after reporting second-quarter earnings of $1.70 a share, better than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
* Many high-tech stocks continued to advance, despite the market's jitters. 
Investors are betting on strong second-quarter earnings from most tech 
companies. Tandem rose 1 to 23 1/4, Autodesk rose 1/2 to 57 and Western Digital 
added 1/4 to 13 1/4. But Tandon Corp. tumbled 1/2 to 3 1/8. It had run up 
sharply recently. 
</P>
<P>
* Chatsworth-based Software Toolworks rose 1/2 to 19 1/4. The company sold 3.8 
million new shares at $18.50 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
* Pathe fell 3/8 to 2 3/8, a new low, on continued pessimism about its efforts 
to acquire MGM/UA. MGM lost 1/4 to 17 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Litton Industries rose 7/8 to 73 3/8. Goldman Sachs traded a 490,000-share 
block of the stock, though it wasn't revealed for whom. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stocks closed lower as concern that Japanese interest rates may climb 
drove investors to the sidelines. The key 225-share Nikkei index was down 
385.85 points to 32,152.43. 
</P>
<P>
In London, stocks closed lower despite the pound's surge. The Financial Times 
100-share index closed down 10 points at 2,327.5. In Frankfurt, West Germany, 
the 30-share DAX ended 14.23 points lower at 1,909.63 after earlier dipping as 
low as 1,899.43.

'SCAPAN' GETS OCEAN ACCESS IN DEL MAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DEL MAR 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's not possible to compete with an azure sky overlooking a crystalline ocean 
rippling gently in the summer breezes in this town. All an open-air adaptation 
of Moliere can hope to do is complement the weather. 
</P>
<P>
And the setting. To say the Del Mar Theatre Ensemble performs in a shopping 
mall is to say Van Gogh did oils. The Del Mar Plaza, current home to this 
family-oriented theater, is one of the smallest and classiest commercial 
enterprises of its sort, with lots of flowers, open space and elegant fountains 
to take the edge off the commerce. 
</P>
<P>
On one of these open decks, with the Pacific Ocean taking up all of stage left, 
the Del Mar Theatre Ensemble is presenting "Scapan -- A Family Farce," adapted 
from Moliere's "Les Fourberies de Scapin" by the director, Bill Ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Ball? The very same who founded and was artistic director of San 
Francisco's American Conservatory Theatre (and who was last seen in a smiling 
performance as Gaev in the recently closed La Jolla Playhouse production of 
"The Cherry Orchard"). 
</P>
<P>
Ball has not permanently ventured into family theater (he now lives in 
Hollywood), but Del Mar Ensemble artistic director Bonnie Tarwater, a former 
Ball student, invited him to create this production for her year-old company. 
</P>
<P>
Is this another one of Scapin's/Scapan's tomfooleries? Not exactly, but Ball is 
up to some of his better old tricks with this "Scapan," which nimbly relies on 
the slapstick of commedia dell'arte in much the same way that did his memorable 
ACT production of "Taming of the Shrew," wherein the stage was a boxing ring 
with the players sitting about its edges when it was not their turn to play. 
</P>
<P>
In this tale of confused identities, the plot is standard. Scot Bishop is the 
wily servant Scapan, who manages to rob a pair of miserly fathers of their 
authority and money, reward their lovesick sons with the women they want for 
wives, and come out of it all relatively unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
With the actors eclectically garbed in yellow and white, like an omelet gone 
berserk, this "Scapan" displays more spit than polish, but disappointed none of 
its younger viewers, spellbound in pint-size chairs under the canopy that 
covers the stage and sitting areas. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop commands the tools of his trade, but lacks the natural playfulness of a 
true comedian, executing Scapan's antics more by the book than the seat of the 
pants. 
</P>
<P>
Phony beards and mustaches conceal Randall Walton's and Dan A. Epstein's peach 
fuzz as the glowering fathers, Geronte and Argante. Christopher Nelson 
(Octavio) and Bradley Thompson (Leander) are their panting, smitten sons, with 
Julie Ann Rogelstad (Hyacinthe and Erica Shaffer (Zerbinette) as the objects of 
their obsessions. Mike Hockett does a worthy strut as Octavio's servant, 
Sylvester, while Michael Murdoch fills in some significant gaps. 
</P>
<P>
But fine points aren't the issue in comedy this broad. Swiftness, smiles and 
simplicity are, and "Scapan" has them all. 
</P>
<P>
Accessibility too. The good news is that the show will go on in this paradise 
all summer. The bad news is that the company has just lost its indoor home, 
which the Del Mar Plaza developers had made available in a corner of their 
upscale mall (along with a $5,000 subsidy for each production). 
</P>
<P>
"We are redefining children's theater and are more committed to it every day," 
Tarwater said. "Being in a shopping center has been part of that evolution. 
People don't put their kids in their Volvos and drive downtown to take them to 
the theater. We want to bring something of depth and importance to children. 
They sell $700 dresses here and we're trying to sell $3 tickets for children's 
theater." 
</P>
<P>
First mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Tickets should be free. Volvos or no Volvos, mall theater is street theater. 
You can't control or contain an audience, and freeloading bystanders are a fact 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
But, look at it another way. The theater's presence attracts families to the 
mall where they'll spend money, sooner or later, one place or another. Ergo, 
the future for the Del Mar Ensemble must lie in getting developers -- not 
necessarily these -- to provide shelter and funds to cover the whole cost of 
production. That, to echo Tarwater, could be "a win-win situation." 
</P>
<P>
 "Scapan" will play La Jolla's Golden Triangle Saturday 7 p.m. and La Jolla 
Village Square Aug. 26,2 p.m. The regular schedule at Del Mar Plaza, 15th 
Street and Camino del Mar, is Saturdays and Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. until July 
22, then Saturdays and Sundays at 3 and7 p.m. until Sept. 2. $3-$5. 
Information: (619) 259-6127.

SUPERVISORS OK MONEY FOR WELFARE PAYMENTS; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGETS: WITH THE STATE WITHHOLDING PAYMENT TO THE COUNTY, THE EMERGENCY ACTION 
GUARANTEES THAT 8,000 FAMILIES WILL GET THEIR CHECKS BY JULY 15. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Furious about state delays in adopting a new budget, the Board of Supervisors 
on Tuesday approved a $2.4-million emergency loan that allows 8,000 welfare 
families in Ventura County to receive mid-July payments as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
Checks of about $330 each will be mailed Friday to households with about 25,000 
members, two-thirds of them children, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The $2.4 million will come from the county general fund unless the Legislature 
and Gov. George Deukmejian resolve their budget impasse by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
Though struggling with a tight budget, county administrators said they have the 
money to make the Aid to Families With Dependent Children payments by July 15. 
</P>
<P>
But supervisors balked at bailing out the state, because it has missed its June 
30 budget deadline four straight years and has failed to set aside money to 
make July social service payments each time. 
</P>
<P>
"They ought to throw out about two-thirds of both bodies and start all over," 
Supervisor James R. Dougherty said, lashing out at the Assembly and state 
Senate. "But that isn't enough for me to take food out of the mouths of 
children." 
</P>
<P>
Chairwoman Madge L. Schaefer said she wanted to refuse payment to make the 
point that the county is not the state's bank, but decided that only the poor 
would have suffered from such a decision. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to teach the state a lesson, go ahead" and withhold payments, 
agreed Supervisor Susan Lacey. "But what will we be teaching these kids?" 
</P>
<P>
The board approved the short-term loan 4 to 0, acting on the recommendation of 
James E. Isom, county social services director. He warned supervisors that 
withholding the payments might be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
Isom said the state is withholding not only its payments to welfare families, 
but federal funds as well. He noted that the state is drawing interest on the 
money, while the county stands to lose thousands of dollars in interest on the 
$2.4 million it is lending the state. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government usually provides about 50% of the aid to families with 
dependent children, the state about 45% and the county 5%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Isom criticized state lawmakers for ensuring the continued 
flow of their own paychecks but not the benefits of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't imagine the governor got shorted, or any of the legislators," Isom 
said. "Everybody is paid but the counties and the recipients of public 
assistance." 
</P>
<P>
County Auditor Norman R. Hawkes, who had refused to make the payments with 
county money without the supervisors' authorization, said Tuesday that the 
county should press the issue by forming a task force to work with state 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it sounds like rhetoric, we've gone through it a hundred times," Hawkes 
said. And Supervisor John K. Flynn was skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"How do you communicate with the Legislature?" Flynn asked. "I tried once to 
post something on the governor's door, but they came out immediately and took 
it down." 
</P>
<P>
In the days before Tuesday's vote, supervisors had said they wanted no repeat 
of 1983, when local welfare families got mid-July checks nearly a week late 
because state lawmakers failed to approve a budget until July 21. 
</P>
<P>
State budget negotiations have been even more difficult this year, as the 
mostly Democratic Legislature has struggled with $3.6 billion in cuts 
recommended by Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
County officials throughout the state have had to react because the budget 
impasse has shut off the flow of state funds on which they depend so heavily. 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura County, the greatest problem has been the delay of paychecks to 
people who provide in-home care for 1,350 disabled and elderly residents. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, hundreds of thousands of dollars collected by the state in sales 
taxes and motor vehicle fees are overdue. At the county Public Social Services 
Agency alone, about $700,000 to pay for administration of state programs has 
not arrived, officials said.

FAMOUS FRIENDS, AVERAGE FOLK REMEMBER LUCY'S LATE OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lucy Casado was trying. Her smile was forced, her eyes were sad. She looked, 
for a moment, all alone in the crowded restaurant that bears her name. 
</P>
<P>
How are you? she was asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm faking it," she admitted. 
</P>
<P>
She tried harder. 
</P>
<P>
"No, don't say that. . . . I am among the most loving, biggest family that 
Frank and I ever had. It was just wonderful today." 
</P>
<P>
After 42 years of marriage, Lucy Casado had every right to her sadness, but 
Frank wouldn't have wanted it that way. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Casado, who died at 66 last Thursday after an eight-month battle with 
lung cancer, was the proprietor of the storied Lucy's El Adobe Cafe on Melrose 
Avenue, hangout of the famous and powerful. He was, as one friend called him, 
"a Mexican Toots Shor," and his wake Tuesday was to be a celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Lucy's El Adobe, after all, "was more than a place to eat," former Gov. Edmund 
G. Brown Jr. had explained in a eulogy during a Mass earlier in the day at St. 
Vibiana's Roman Catholic Cathedral downtown. "It was a place to be, to meet 
friends, to be seen and to see." 
</P>
<P>
Even with Casado absent from his usual table, Lucy's was all that Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, who usually orders the "Jerry Brown Special," was noshing on sushi. His 
ex-sweetheart, Linda Ronstadt, was relaxing by the piano after singing "Ave 
Maria" at the Mass. Actor John Candy, who was a pallbearer, left early, but 
songwriter Jimmy Webb played the piano and sang. 
</P>
<P>
Friends said Casado, who was buried at Calvary Cemetery, would have been 
pleased -- except that the caterer brought sushi. 
</P>
<P>
The non-famous were there too. Over by the fountain, Hollywood Division 
Homicide Detective Bruce Wilson remembered how when he was on uniform patrol 
and it was time for a meal break, Casado knew officers got only 45 minutes. If 
there was a line out front, Wilson and other officers knew to go around to the 
back. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd sit me down and feed me -- he treated all of us that way," Wilson said. 
"It was a neighborhood, palsy, backdoor kind of deal. . . . And when I brought 
my family in, he treated us like royalty. . . . I loved Frank Casado." 
</P>
<P>
What made Lucy's El Adobe so special? 
</P>
<P>
Many people, such as state Controller Gray Davis and political commentator Bill 
Press, described it as a second home. Songwriter J. D. Souther described Frank 
and Lucy as "my other parents." 
</P>
<P>
"The family just exudes warmth," Davis said. "And either you've got that or you 
don't. You can't bottle and sell that." 
</P>
<P>
At the wake, Casado's brothers, Raymond and Juan, told stories of the old days 
growing up in Boyle Heights; how Frank used to play tennis with future great 
Pancho Gonzales. One time Frank went to Beverly Hills and won a junior 
tournament. A newspaper photographer took a picture of the runner-up, because 
Frank, in his Eastside clothes, didn't look like a tennis champ. 
</P>
<P>
Casado worked as a shoeshine boy as a teen-ager, as a cab driver and joined the 
Navy, rising to the rank of chief petty officer during World War II. He later 
drove a truck for the Seven-Up Bottling Co. and then, Lucy said, became the 
first Mexican-American given the job of salesman by the company. He quickly 
became their best. 
</P>
<P>
He was a founder of the Mexican-American Political Assn. and helped Rep. Edward 
Roybal (D-Los Angeles) get elected to the City Council in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
Casado and his wife opened their restaurant in 1964 across from Paramount 
Studios. It was an instant success, a haven for people of politics and 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The future Gov. Brown was a mere trustee of the Los Angeles Community College 
District when he started hanging out at Lucy's, and the cafe's fortunes rose 
with Brown's. Lucy Casado smiled remembering the night she played matchmaker. 
At Frank's suggestion, she introduced the governor to Ronstadt, sparking a 
romance that, according to Lucy, survives as friendship. 
</P>
<P>
Casado's generosity was legion. If someone asked him for a loan, one friend 
recalled, Casado might say, "See that bank over there? They promised they won't 
make tacos and I promised I won't make loans." 
</P>
<P>
But in the up-and-down world of politics and entertainment, Casado often helped 
friends through lean times. Webb, for one, ran up two years of meal tabs before 
hitting it big with songs such as "MacArthur Park" and "Up, Up and Away." 
</P>
<P>
And now Lucy approached the man at the piano with a request. 
</P>
<P>
"Sing my song." 
</P>
<P>
"They're all your songs," Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
Then, beneath the din of conversation, Webb softly sang a new ballad that had 
indeed been dedicated to Lucy. One line recalled how they'd "drink margaritas 
all night long in an old cantina." Ronstadt has recorded the tune; soon, it 
will be released as a single. 
</P>
<P>
"You see," Lucy Casado said, "you give and you receive." 
</P>
<P>
The song is titled "Adios."

THOUSAND OAKS COUNCIL BROKE LAW, D.A. RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Thousand Oaks City Council violated the state's open-meeting law two weeks 
ago when it voted without public notice to provide free office space for 
Supervisor-elect Maria VanderKolk, the Ventura County district attorney's 
office announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But council members -- acting on the advice of City Atty. Mark G. Sellers -- 
apparently did not realize that they were breaking the law when they took the 
action June 26 without putting the item on the agenda beforehand, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Matthew J. Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, county prosecutors will not file criminal charges against Thousand 
Oaks officials, Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Hardy warned officials in a letter sent to Sellers on Tuesday to 
be more careful in the future. Under the Ralph M. Brown Act, a city council 
cannot take action on a measure unless the item has been posted on an agenda at 
least 24 hours before the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks council members had tried to get around the Brown Act requirement 
by declaring an emergency, which would have allowed them to vote on the measure 
without public notice. But Hardy said VanderKolk's request for office space at 
the old city library on Wilbur Road could hardly be construed as a calamity 
that needed immediate attention. 
</P>
<P>
"Our primary concern now is to assure that no future violations of the Brown 
Act be committed by your City Council," Hardy wrote. "Please understand that 
repeated violations of the Brown Act may result in our concluding that such 
actions, rather than innocent mistakes, are really deliberate abuses of the 
act." 
</P>
<P>
Sellers, who has served as city attorney for six years, said the district 
attorney's decision is unfair. 
</P>
<P>
"They took a hard, fixed position" without seeking the city's side of the 
story, Sellers said. "They didn't want to talk to me. They just went on their 
own merry way. It's a silly investigation, it's a silly issue, and it's an 
unfortunate situation." 
</P>
<P>
Sellers defended the council's action, saying that VanderKolk had asked the 
city officials the day before the meeting for the office space, which she said 
she needed immediately. He said that according to his interpretation of the 
open meeting law, the council was allowed to act on the request because it was 
made after the agendas were prepared. 
</P>
<P>
Although the council was scheduled to vote again on the issue late at its 
meeting Tuesday night in an attempt to clear the record, VanderKolk said 
Tuesday afternoon that she is no longer interested in using the office. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing I need right now is public controversy," said VanderKolk, who 
defeated Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer in the June election by 98 votes. "I 
don't want to start on a bad note." 
</P>
<P>
VanderKolk had requested use of the office because she said she had nowhere to 
work until she takes over Schaefer's position in January. At that time, the 
county will provide VanderKolk with funds to rent office space in the 2nd 
Supervisorial District, which is centered in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
Since the city had unused space, officials thought it would be a nice gesture 
to allow VanderKolk to use an office rent-free. 
</P>
<P>
"People look at this thing as a gratuitous thing when it's a gesture of 
goodwill," VanderKolk said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she will conduct business out of her home until she takes office in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
A complaint by Gregory P. Cole, a Thousand Oaks dentist and a Ventura County 
Community College District trustee, prompted the district attorney's office to 
investigate the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Cole, a supporter of Schaefer, said he was so irritated that the council did 
not place the item on the agenda or allow public comment on the issue that he 
requested the investigation. Hardy agreed to look into the matter, as he does 
on all alleged violations of the open-meeting law.

FROM RUSSIA, WITH HOLLYWOOD'S DREAMS; 
</P>
<P>
DISILLUSIONMENT: TWO SOVIET MEN LEAVE A CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS EXCHANGE 
PROGRAM, SAYING THE WORK WAS MORE THAN THEY BARGAINED FOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
They came all the way from Moscow, expecting to make contacts in Hollywood and 
elsewhere, while doing a little work in Ventura County parks. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the two Soviet visitors found themselves making mud bricks in the hot 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
So what would any self-respecting members of the proletariat do but revolt? 
</P>
<P>
The two Soviet men decided this week to leave an international exchange program 
at the California Conservation Corps' camp at Camarillo. The tough work regimen 
was more than they bargained for, district director Ignacio Pina said. 
</P>
<P>
"They said they were misled, that this wasn't what they signed up for," Pina 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The two men, Vitali Matysko, 24, and Vladimar Mitrkhine, 34, were among 19 
Soviet citizens taking part in a four-week international exchange program. Six 
were assigned to the Camarillo camp, seven to the corps' camp in San Luis 
Obispo and six to a camp in the Bay Area, program assistant Lisa Doty said. 
</P>
<P>
"They come over as volunteers, to see our program, how it runs, and hopefully 
take it back and implement it in their country," Doty said. A contingent of 
American corps members will visit the Soviet Union next month, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Doty said the visitors generally follow the same routine as regular corps 
members, which includes a 5:45 a.m. wake-up call, physical training and five 
full days of work, such as making bricks for the restoration of the historic 
Presidio in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess they don't like making bricks," Pina said. 
</P>
<P>
Matysko and Mitrkhine did not wish to be interviewed or photographed, said Olia 
Oakley, who speaks Russian and invited the visitors to stay in her Oxnard home 
until they return to the Soviet Union next week. 
</P>
<P>
Pina said he was willing to be flexible but could not grant the two weekdays 
off that they requested. He said the program is supposed to be an even exchange 
of work, and it would be unfair to California taxpayers if the Soviets got 
leisure time while their American counterparts in Russia worked a full week. 
</P>
<P>
None of the other Russian visitors has complained, Pina added. 
</P>
<P>
Matysko and Mitrkhine, he said, "had their own objectives, to make business 
contacts." 
</P>
<P>
Matysko, he said, is a writer who "was trying to make contact with Hollywood 
and Las Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
Mitrkhine was interested in learning how drivers' education is taught in the 
United States. Pina said that could have been arranged one day, but the Russian 
wanted more time off than that. 
</P>
<P>
Pina said he liked the pair and has no hard feelings. As a goodwill gesture, he 
said, he's taking them and the other Soviets to Disneyland today. 
</P>
<P>
But Matysko and Mitrkhine have already started enjoying the pleasures of 
Southern California, Oakley said Tuesday. "They just got back from the beach."

PERMIT: ONE FIRM HAS BEEN HAULING VENTURA'S GARBAGE FOR SIX DECADES, BUT A 
NEWCOMER IS PETITIONING CITY HALL FOR A PIECE OF THE ACTION. 
</P>

<P>
A garbage war has begun to heat up in the city of Ventura. On one side of the 
scrap is E.J. Harrison &amp; Sons, a family that has monopolized the business 
of collecting the city's trash for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
But seeking to unseat the Harrisons at the top of the garbage heap in the city 
is another Ventura trash collection company, Rubbish Control Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Next week the city will vote to award a company owned by the Harrisons, Gold 
Coast Recycling, exclusive rights to buy Ventura's recyclable waste for the 
next five years. 
</P>
<P>
E.J. Harrison's three sons own one-third of Gold Coast and one of them, Jim 
Harrison, is the company president. On July 30, the council is scheduled to 
vote on whether to renew E.J. Harrison &amp; Sons' trash-hauling permit. E.J. 
Harrison has hauled the city's trash the past six decades. 
</P>
<P>
But Rubbish Control Inc., which deals primarily with customers in 
unincorporated areas of the county, although it has some customers in the city, 
wants a bigger piece of the action. 
</P>
<P>
After exchanging letters with city officials asking for a permit to expand 
operations in Ventura, Rubbish Control took the matter directly to the City 
Council on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"We want the right to compete," said Rick Chaidez, an attorney for Rubbish 
Control. "We want a part of the recycling business, and we want to force 
Harrison to drive prices down." 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Rubbish Control officials have sent six letters to City 
Manager John Baker requesting a meeting to discuss the possibility of obtaining 
a permit to work in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Baker responded last July that the city had just finished its yearly review of 
its trash permit, and that the newcomer would have to wait another year before 
being considered for the permit. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Rubbish Control officials said they have tried repeatedly to meet 
with city officials, but the requested meeting never took place. 
</P>
<P>
"The monopoly and control of the refuse/rubbish business in the City of Ventura 
held by the Harrison family seems out of control," Chaidez wrote Baker in a 
July 6 letter. "Is there really an intent on the part of your office and other 
city offices to allow competitive bidding?" 
</P>
<P>
Terry Adelman, Ventura finance director, said city officials never met with 
Rubbish Control because the garbage haulers failed to provide the city with 
information needed to begin considering an application. 
</P>
<P>
"We told them that we needed the information to see if there is a reason to 
meet, and they never presented that," Adelman said. 
</P>
<P>
But at Monday's council session, Baker told Chaidez that he has asked his 
secretary to schedule a meeting sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Rubbish Control owner Morteza Yassani said Baker's secretary has 
yet to contact him. 
</P>
<P>
Rubbish Control officials also contend that Harrison is abusing its privilege 
by charging whatever it wants and that a new company in the city would benefit 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
"Our prices are more competitive," said Gloria Whitcomb, Rubbish Control office 
manager. "We average $6 less per commercial bin." 
</P>
<P>
But a price comparison on bids made by both companies in August to haul rubbish 
from county buildings within the city of Ventura shows that E.J. Harrison 
charges $5 less for a weekly pickup of a commercial-size bin. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Harrison said that the threat of losing the city contract if his company 
fails to deliver quality service and prices is incentive enough for his company 
and that competition will not necessarily benefit the city. 
</P>
<P>
"In the past, wide-open competition hasn't worked well," he said, adding that 
the city had six competing garbage companies as recently as the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"The ideal situation is a partnership between the city and the refuse hauler, 
like the one we have right now." 
</P>
<P>
City Council members said Tuesday that they are happy with Harrison &amp; Sons 
but are open to new proposals. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that the future is with the Harrisons," said Councilman Gary 
Tuttle, who sits on the county regional sanitation board. "They provide good 
service, competitive rates, and they are a local family. We know them and 
that's important to me." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Tuttle said, "the threat of new competition means continued 
good service and good rates." 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up with the Harrisons," Councilman Jim Monahan said. "I know they are 
honest, legitimate folk. But we could probably benefit from a little 
competition in the commercial refuse sector." 
</P>
<P>
Many local businesses seem to agree. In a survey conducted earlier this year by 
Rubbish Control among Greater Ventura Chamber of Commerce members, more than 
75% of the 692 respondents said "we feel there needs to be another rubbish 
hauler." 
</P>
<P>
Adelman said the survey will be considered when the city decides on Rubbish 
Control's permit in upcoming weeks. But, he added, the city will also consider 
that Rubbish Control is already operating in the city -- and without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
"We told them that we're looking for upright citizens and the fact that they 
are violating the city code will definitely be a consideration that the council 
will take into account when it makes a judgment," Adelman said. 
</P>
<P>
Rubbish Control officials freely acknowledge that they service about six 
commercial accounts in the city, including Kinko's on Stanley Avenue, Ventura 
Carpet on Palma Avenue and the House of Paper on Palma Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not trying to take away anybody's business," said Yassani, whose company 
has operated in Ventura County since 1968. "We just go in when businesses call 
us because they are unhappy with Harrison."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COASTAL AGENCY DEALS BLOW TO SEWER PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The California Coastal Commission on Tuesday dealt a severe blow to a bid by 
Los Angeles County to speed construction of a controversial sewer system in 
Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
By a unanimous vote, the state panel rejected the county's request to go 
forward with its proposed $43-million sewer system, bypassing several 
administrative steps that ordinarily could be expected to take several more 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Left unchallenged, the outcome would greatly increase the likelihood that the 
county will be unable to start work on the sewer before Malibu becomes a city. 
County officials have indicated that they may file suit against the commission 
in an attempt to reverse the decision. 
</P>
<P>
A three-judge panel in Los Angeles has set a July 18 hearing to decide whether 
incorporation, which voters approved last month, is allowed to go forward or 
whether the county can delay it until next March.

REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT GETS TENTATIVE OK

<P>
The Santa Paula City Council has given preliminary approval to its first 
redevelopment project -- a 1,100-acre area that virtually encompasses the 
southern third of the city. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Bob Livingston said a $250-million plan to improve public 
walkways, flood control channels and underground utility lines could begin in 
three to five years, provided that there are no legal complications. It will 
take that long for property values to increase enough to provide the agency 
with the tax revenue to begin the redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
But county planner Bruce Smith, who last week called the redevelopment plan 
inadequate, said Tuesday that parts of it are internally inconsistent. For 
instance, Smith said the Land Use Element of the plan does not include areas 
subject to flooding. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that the county "can litigate or we can accept a multimillion-dollar 
loss over the next 40 years." Another option is for the city to offer the 
county a pass-through agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Under such a pact, which would reduce the likelihood of friction between the 
city and county, the county would receive an agreed-upon percentage of any 
revenue realized by an increase in property taxes. Under redevelopment, the 
city's property tax base is frozen, so that taxing agencies such as the county 
no longer automatically receive such revenue when property values increase. 
</P>
<P>
The agency has reached accord with the schools, the library district and the 
water district. It is still talking with representatives of the community 
college district. 
</P>
<P>
"We have met with county officials, but they don't seem to want to negotiate," 
said Councilman John Melton, adding that city officials believe the plan is 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Paula Councilman Carl Barringer said he believed the county's actions 
were financially motivated. "It's a delaying tactic to stop the implementation 
of the Redevelopment Agency. It's a rear guard action on their part." 
</P>
<P>
The next step in the adoption of the project is final approval by the City 
Council, which is expected at its meeting next Monday, Melton said. If all goes 
as planned, the adoption will be filed the next day and will go into effect 30 
days thereafter. AMELIA CHAFFEE

CLEANUP EQUIPMENT REQUIRED FOR PETS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Within several months, most of the county's dog and cat owners who walk their 
pets will have to carry equipment to clean up after them. 
</P>
<P>
The regulation, approved by the County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, takes 
effect on Aug. 9 for residents of unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
Three or four months later, the same rule will also apply to most other county 
residents, said Kathy Jenks, director of the Animal Regulation Department. 
</P>
<P>
"Only Oxnard and Santa Paula will be exempt, because they have their own animal 
control departments," Jenks said. She said it will take several months to issue 
warnings to residents of cities served by her agency. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ordinance, owners of dogs or cats may be cited if they fail to carry 
containers and fail to clean up after their animals. Jenks said it will be up 
to the courts to set penalties for those convicted. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors also voted to allow dog owners to walk their pets at Silver 
Strand and Hollywood beaches near Oxnard in the evening and early morning. 
</P>
<P>
Leashed pets will be allowed on these county beaches between 5 p.m. and 9 a.m. 
beginning Aug. 9. Owners will be required to carry cleanup equipment when they 
walk their dogs on the beach, Jenks said. JACK SEARLES

DISPUTE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Lomita man who tried to be the peacemaker in a dispute between his twin 
brother and another man died this week after the man suddenly drew a gun and 
shot him twice in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Michael Pack, 23, died at Bay Harbor Hospital about an hour after the 
10:30 p.m. Monday shooting in the courtyard of a Lomita condominium complex, 
Sheriff's Deputy Roger Hom said. 
</P>
<P>
The man accused of shooting Pack, William Henry Hosken, 23, was booked on 
suspicion of murder and was being held without bail, Hom said. 
</P>
<P>
Pack went with two friends to Hosken's home to try to resolve a dispute between 
Hosken and Pack's twin, Steve, witnesses said. Steve Pack, who did not know his 
brother was going to talk to Hosken, said in an interview that he had been 
dating Hosken's estranged wife, Donna, and that Hosken had been threatening the

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WATER BOARD OKS STUDY ON DESALINATION PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Metropolitan Water District's board of directors approved a $500,000 study 
Tuesday that will outline the construction and operation of a pilot 
desalination plant that will serve Southern California, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The study, scheduled to last about two years, will determine the cost of 
building a plant that would produce 5 to 10 million gallons of fresh water a 
day, said Gary Snyder, a spokesman for the Los Angeles-based MWD. It will also 
pinpoint a location and design a basic construction model for the facility, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's partly because of the drought but mainly because of our long-term needs 
for additional water resources," said Snyder, explaining why the study and 
proposed plant are necessary.

BILL BOYARSKY: A STRONG CASE FOR AIDS FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The typical patient at the Minority AIDS Project is gay, poor and black, under 
40, estranged from his family and addicted to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
If he isn't already overcome with the symptoms of AIDS, he's just been hit with 
the realization that he has the disease and will die from it. Dealing with 
complex cases such as his require medical technology, drug treatment, home care 
and financial and psychological support. That's why Los Angeles County health 
officials want the Board of Supervisors to increase the amount of money 
available for AIDS care by $9 million, raising government spending on the 
disease to $69 million. But the board, controlled by a conservative three-man 
majority, has shown no indication it will support the request. 
</P>
<P>
This is an important dispute, and a very human one. Health officials told the 
supervisors Tuesday that by 1993, more than 24,000 people in the county will 
have AIDS. The figure, as of May 31, was 9,513. There are another 109,000 
infected with HIV, the AIDS virus, although they have not yet developed the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
The human suffering represented by those figures hasn't been conveyed in past 
supervisorial discussions of AIDS. Rather, the request for money has become the 
center of a media circus. 
</P>
<P>
It was certainly circus time in May when more than 36 rubber-gloved sheriff's 
deputies arrested 27 activists who had written "Aids Care Now" in red lipstick 
on the glass barrier that separates the supervisors from the audience. A June 
demonstration was more restrained. Seven of the protesters sang a hymn as the 
supervisors' meeting opened. Unappreciative of this call for divine help, the 
supes had the singers arrested. 
</P>
<P>
I saw the real story -- good people, working hard to help the sick -- when I 
visited the Minority AIDS Project. Much of the $9 million would go to efforts 
such as this. 
</P>
<P>
The Minority AIDS Project is located in a one-story, brown-tiled building on 
West Jefferson Boulevard, two blocks west of La Brea Avenue. A manufacturer is 
across the street. An old Los Angeles motor court, turned into shabby 
apartments for the poor, is nearby. Above the front door of the project 
building is a large sign: "Unity Fellowship Center. Love For Everyone." The 
Rev. Carl Bean of the Unity Fellowship of Christ Church, who is black and gay, 
started the project in 1985, as he watched the destruction caused by the AIDS 
epidemic in the black and Latino communities. 
</P>
<P>
This low-rent project cares for more than 700 people with AIDS -- 57% of them 
black, 31% Latino -- on a budget of just $1.6 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
The lives of the patients are rough. "They're unemployed, underemployed, 
homeless, doubly diagnosed with substance abuse and AIDS," said Gil Gerald, the 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
If the disease is at an early stage, the prescription is outpatient treatment 
with the drug AZT to slow the disease. That means a wait of at least six weeks 
for an appointment at County-USC Medical Center. Once admitted for treatment, 
the patients wait to see the doctor. Gerald said, "We tell them, 'You've got a 
doctor's appointment. It'll take five hours. Are you going to bring something 
with you to do?' " 
</P>
<P>
As the disease worsens, the choice is between admittance to the county hospital 
or home care. The project provides home nursing care to 45 people. That costs 
taxpayers $120 a day, compared to $700 a day at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
As in other places, AIDS care in Los Angeles County depends largely on a 
network of community organizations such as the Minority AIDS Project, rather 
than government agencies. But they've been starved for funds because the 
supervisors were slow to respond when the epidemic spread in the early '80s. 
Conservatives killed educational programs and distribution of clean needles and 
bleach to drug addicts. Even more harmful to public health, they shifted county 
spending priorities from health and social welfare programs to law enforcement. 
That philosophy hacked away at requests from department officials who believed 
more money was needed. AIDS programs were victims. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the supervisors' experts advised them the time had come to change. 
The County-Community HIV Planning Council, heavy with county health experts and 
community leaders, presented a report to the board making a strong case for 
more money. Joining them was Bob Gates, the county's health director, an 
advocate of the $9-million appropriation. 
</P>
<P>
This time, there were no demonstrations, no arrests. Just serious men and women 
speaking to the board. They've made their case. Now it's up to the supervisors 
when they consider the county budget next week.

CITY, COUNCILMAN END CARPORT DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Councilman John McWherter resolved a lawsuit with the city of Ventura over a 
portion of a carport that the councilman unknowingly built on city property. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Superior Court Judge Edwin Osborne ruled that McWherter could buy 
the city land underneath the carport and adjoining slope for $5,000, the 
councilman said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad it's all over," McWherter said after being told that the court had 
put an end to his sticky, 3-year-old dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, elected officials cannot enter into contracts with the cities 
they represent. So McWherter was barred from buying the carport property from 
the city without a favorable court decision. 
</P>
<P>
McWherter discovered that his carport was on city property in October, 1987, 
when a city crew surveying nearby property found that land maps had been 
improperly drawn. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with the option of either resigning from the council or tearing down his 
carport, the 17-year council veteran came up with a better idea: he asked the 
city to sue him over the rights on the carport property. On Tuesday, McWherter 
said the judge decided that "state law does not apply on a case like mine. 
Thank goodness." SANTIAGO O'DONNELL

COUNCIL TO VOTE ON PITTS RANCH PROJECT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Camarillo City Council will decide today whether to approve the first 
51-acre phase of a residential and industrial development on the east side of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
The Pardee Co. development, which calls for 126 houses on 31 acres, also 
includes a 16-acre park and four acres to be donated to the city, earmarked for 
a substation for Ventura County Sheriff's deputies who patrol the city. 
</P>
<P>
Located west of Calleguas Creek and south of Upland Road, the Pardee project is 
part of an area known as the Pitts Ranch. The City Council approved an overall 
plan last year designating where and when the area would be developed. 
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for rerouting Calleguas Creek, a move that opponents said would 
endanger fish and other wildlife. Residents who wanted to preserve the creek 
also argued that drainage from any streets built in the area would damage it as 
a wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
The council ordered a study on those issues and said it must be completed 
before construction begins near the creek. The study will describe how the 
stream bed should be protected. 
</P>
<P>
However, Assistant City Manager Larry Davis said Monday that this phase of the 
Pitts Ranch plan does not include any acreage near the creek. 
</P>
<P>
The public hearing on the Pardee project will be part of the council's regular 
meeting at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at City Hall. JOANNA M. MILLER

3 MEN SENTENCED FOR SELLING CRACK

<TEXT>
<P>
A Ventura County Superior Court judge sentenced three men to prison Tuesday for 
selling crack cocaine from a dilapidated house in west Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Alonzo Haynes, 38, was sentenced to five years for maintaining a house for 
illicit narcotics sales and selling crack cocaine; Duchon Fields, 23, was 
sentenced to five years and four months for two counts of selling crack 
cocaine; and Dexter Williams, 23, received a five-year sentence for one count 
of selling crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Charles R. McGrath suspended sentencing until all three men undergo 
psychological testing. If the tests find that they are drug addicts, the men 
could serve their time undergoing drug treatment at the California 
Rehabilitation Center, Deputy Dist. Atty. Jimmie Grunert said. 
</P>
<P>
Haynes will also be examined by a court-appointed psychiatrist to determine 
whether his combat duty in Vietnam from 1970 to 1971 caused post-traumatic 
stress disorder, Grunert said. If Haynes is found to be suffering from the 
combat-related illness, he could be sentenced to federal prison instead of 
state prison, Grunert said. 
</P>
<P>
The men were arrested in a Feb. 26 raid on the house at 948 Olive St. by SWAT 
teams from the Ventura Police Department and the county Sheriff's Department.

REOPENING OF VA PSYCHIATRIC WARD QUESTIONED; 
</P>
<P>
VETERAN AFFAIRS: SEN. CRANSTON ASKS AGENCY TO JUSTIFY ACTION AT LONG BEACH 
CENTER WHERE FIVE PATIENTS COMMITTED SUICIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston called Tuesday for the Department of Veterans Affairs 
to justify the reopening of a psychiatric ward in Long Beach that had been 
closed in the wake of five patient suicides. 
</P>
<P>
The troubled ward at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Long Beach began 
admitting patients again Monday after being closed for eight weeks, although a 
federal inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the deaths is incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston, chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, asked for an 
independent team of at least two psychiatrists unaffiliated with the VA system 
to investigate the suicides, as well as the decision to accept patients again. 
</P>
<P>
"Please provide a justification for the decision to reopen the ward while the 
issues which initially warranted the closure are still under investigation," 
Cranston wrote in a letter to Anthony J. Principi, deputy secretary of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in Washington and Long Beach, saying they had not yet seen the 
letter, declined to comment. A spokeswoman in the VA's San Francisco regional 
office, which oversees the Long Beach hospital, said the decision to reopen was 
thoroughly reviewed and "very confidently made." 
</P>
<P>
The letter, although worded evenhandedly, seemed intended to speed up a federal 
inquiry that began in May after The Times reported the five suicides at the 
hospital between March, 1989, and last April -- a number equal to the total 
recorded by all five state-run psychiatric hospitals in two year. 
</P>
<P>
Three men hanged themselves, one leaped from a hospital roof and the fifth shot 
himself in the mouth after he was allegedly denied admission. Two of the 
hangings occurred in the locked ward, designed to keep suicidal, homicidal, 
violent or gravely disabled psychiatric patients under constant or 
near-constant watch. One patient, a 27-year-old Marine, used the shoelaces from 
his combat boots, which psychiatric nurses said he never should have had. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation was ordered in May by Principi, second in command of the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, which operates 172 hospitals nationwide. Two 
inspectors spent nearly three weeks in May and June at the 1,368-bed Long Beach 
facility, one of the largest hospitals in the system. A report has yet to be 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Donna St. John said the inspector general is already lining up 
independent experts to review the suicides, a process that she said accounts 
for the report's delay. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's medical director, Dean Stordahl, earlier expressed confidence in 
the ward's ability to keep patients safe. He said the nursing staff has 
undergone a six-week "team-building" training session, and the ward has been 
upgraded with more secure windows and other security measures. 
</P>
<P>
Once the training and renovations were complete, Dr. Arthur Lewis, acting chief 
medical director of the Department of Veterans Affairs, ordered the ward 
reopened, said Ruth Villasenor, spokeswoman for the San Francisco regional 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"Every step of the way, Long Beach represented to the western region what was 
going on (concerning retraining and upgrading). Based on that, the go-ahead was 
very confidently made," she said. "We are awaiting the results of the inspector 
general's investigation, but that was not considered a basis to keeping a ward 
like that closed." 
</P>
<P>
During the eight weeks the ward was dark, only 19 of 82 patients were referred 
to other VA hospitals. The rest were admitted to private psychiatric facilities 
at a cost of $189,000, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Cranston expressed concern over whether the ward should have reopened at all 
and has asked the regional office to "monitor (the hospital) actively."

PROBATION REFUSED IN THREAT CASE; 
</P>
<P>
CRIMES: A MAN WHO BLAMES A PROSECUTOR FOR MISHANDLING THE CASE AGAINST 2 MEN 
ACCUSED OF BEATING HIS SON TO DEATH TURNS DOWN THE OFFER.

<P>
A Newbury Park man refused to accept five years' probation Tuesday in Ventura 
County Superior Court for threatening to kill a prosecutor whom he blamed for 
mishandling the case against two men accused of beating his son to death. 
</P>
<P>
But Judge Charles R. McGrath continued the sentencing hearing for Charles 
Flores, 48, until this morning so Flores can consult with his attorney. Flores 
could face up to three years in state prison if he refuses probation, Deputy 
Atty. Gen. Patrick Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
Flores was convicted on May 21 of threatening great bodily injury or death for 
his threat to Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard E. Holmes during a Feb. 6 phone 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
Flores blamed Holmes for failing to win harsh penalties against two men accused 
of killing his son, John. 
</P>
<P>
John Flores died of brain injuries he suffered in a brawl outside a party in 
Newbury Park on Jan. 20, 1989. The men tried for his death were Larnell Bush, 
who was convicted of aggravated assault last July and sentenced to 90 days in 
jail and five years probation, and John Yurek, acquitted of manslaughter last 
August. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Holmes used his right as a felony victim to make a statement to the 
court during Flores' sentencing hearing -- and laid some of the blame for John 
Flores' death at his father's feet. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Flores listened quietly. 
</P>
<P>
Flores "has to stop believing everyone's wrong but him. He has to take 
responsibility for his actions," Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes said John Flores was drinking heavily the night he died and was found to 
have about twice the legal limit of alcohol in his system. 
</P>
<P>
Holmes said party-goers asked John Flores three times to leave the party 
because on other occasions he had beaten the two women who were the host and 
the guest of honor. Holmes also said John Flores started the brawl in which he 
died by provoking one of the suspects with a racial slur. 
</P>
<P>
"Who taught him that, by the age of 19, heavy drinking was acceptable 
behavior?" Holmes said. "Who taught John Flores that violence was a viable 
solution?" 
</P>
<P>
McGrath said he would sentence Flores to five years' probation under certain 
conditions; these include orders to stay away from Holmes and the Courthouse, 
carry no guns and undergo psychotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
But when McGrath asked if he accepted the conditions, Flores said, "I'm not 
sure, I think not." 
</P>
<P>
Later, outside the courtroom, Charles Flores talked agitatedly with defense 
attorney William C. Maxwell and Brooks, who stepped in to prosecute Flores to 
prevent a conflict of interest with the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Flores' wife, Sharon, criticized Holmes for blaming her husband for 
their son's death. She blasted Holmes for his accusations against John Flores. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where he's getting his information, but it's false. Why is he 
trying to agitate us?" she said. "I'm so disappointed that the man could 
slander my son in court and stand here and slander my son again . . . I know my 
child was not a monster." 
</P>
<P>
Flores said outside the courtroom that he will refuse to accept probation until 
prosecutors reveal more about his son's case, even if it means going to jail. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to agree to do anything for them until they agree to look into 
this and answer a couple of questions. I think they should wash their own hands 
before they wash mine," Flores told reporters, but refused to elaborate.

MAN PLANNING TO TESTIFY IN EL SALVADOR DEATH SQUAD PROBE ARRESTED BY INS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A member of an El Salvador military intelligence unit linked to the murders of 
Jesuit priests in that country was arrested in Long Beach on Tuesday in the 
midst of a visit during which he planned to testify about the killings, 
activists said. 
</P>
<P>
Cesar Vielman Joya-Martinez, 28, employed as a construction worker in the beach 
city, was arrested by Immigration and Naturalization Service agents on federal 
charges of illegally entering the United States after being deported on the 
same charge seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Activists seeking an end to U.S. involvement in El Salvador were trying to set 
up interviews between Joya-Martinez and a congressional committee investigating 
alleged death squad activity in the Central American country.

BLACK HISTORY: NAACP CONVENTIONEERS HELP REDEDICATE THE HISTORIC DUNBAR HOTEL. 
IT WAS ONCE A CULTURAL HUB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Fannie Singletary of Washington, D.C., bundled her husband and four children 
into the family car and traveled 3,000 miles to help plan for the future. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, however, she piled them onto a bus in Los Angeles for a 15-mile 
ride into the past. 
</P>
<P>
Singletary was one of dozens of delegates to the annual convention of the 
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People who traveled from the 
high-rises of downtown to abandoned storefronts of South-Central Los Angeles 
during a tour of "historical African-American Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, the visitors stopped to help rededicate the historic Dunbar 
Hotel, renowned in the 1930s, '40s and '50s as the hub of Los Angeles black 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
Strengthened to meet earthquake standards and refurbished in large part with 
city redevelopment funds at a cost of $4.2 million, the 62-year-old Central 
Avenue hotel has been reopened as a 73-unit apartment building for low-income 
elderly residents and a museum of black history. 
</P>
<P>
In its heyday, the Dunbar Hotel was known as a West Coast mixture of the 
Waldorf-Astoria and the Cotton Club. 
</P>
<P>
For years, it was the only major hotel in the city that welcomed blacks. Every 
prominent black visiting Los Angeles passed through its Art Deco lobby adorned 
with arched, Spanish arcade-like windows, tiled walls and a spectacular 
flagstone floor. 
</P>
<P>
In 1928, the hotel housed delegates to the first NAACP convention to be held in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Later, its nightclub was the stage for many of the great black performers of 
the day -- Count Basie, Lionel Hampton, Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke 
Ellington and Nat King Cole. 
</P>
<P>
The Dunbar's dazzle faded when Los Angeles' other hotels opened their doors to 
blacks, and blacks began drifting away from Central Avenue as the city became 
more integrated. By the mid-1980s, the hotel was closed and the graceful 
building fell into disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
Much of its glory has been restored, current NAACP delegates discovered 
Tuesday. After traveling through the more run-down section of the Central 
Avenue business district, those on the historical tour were surprised when 
their bus rolled to a stop outside the Dunbar. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, they found Mayor Tom Bradley and black civic leaders waiting to 
rechristen the grand old hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley praised the work done to "breathe new life and vigor into this 
magnificent hotel" and predicted that the hotel may have the same effect in 
helping revive the surrounding neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Johnson, a former owner of the hotel who has dreamed for nearly a 
quarter of a century of establishing a black museum at the Dunbar, pledged to 
convention delegates that a historical collection will be on display in a 
mezzanine museum area above the lobby the next time they visit the city. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have seen the collection, which was displayed in the hotel in the 
1970s as the "Museum in Black," describe it as a thought-provoking lesson in 
the way things once were. Among the artifacts are Mammy dolls, a railroad sign 
reading "Colored Waiting Room," a poster for "Uncle Tom's Cabin" and a music 
folder for "Remus Takes the Cake." 
</P>
<P>
After the speeches, the visitors climbed back onto the bus to see for 
themselves the way Los Angeles once was. Tour guides from the Our Authors Study 
Club explained how the city has changed -- for the better and the worse. 
</P>
<P>
The bus passed by the intersection of Central and Vernon avenues, an area that 
decades ago was the thriving "downtown area" to most blacks. Today, many stores 
in the area are boarded up and unemployed people loiter on the curbs. 
</P>
<P>
The group traveled past funeral homes and an insurance company that served 
blacks when white-owned businesses refused to. They passed long-established 
churches that have never ceased serving the community and empty lots where 
community auditoriums or cornerstone businesses once thrived. They passed the 
new California Afro-American History Museum at Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
In the downtown area, tour leader Genevieve Shepherd explained how black 
architect Paul R. Williams helped design several Civic Center buildings. She 
pointed out the Music Center, which was built with the help of a $500,000 gift 
from singer Cole and where actor Robert Guillaume now has the lead role in 
"Phantom of the Opera." 
</P>
<P>
The bus traveled through Skid Row, past Union Station and Olvera Street, where 
study club President Dolores Nehemiah explained that 26 black settlers were 
among a handpicked group of 44 people who founded what is now Los Angeles in 
1781. 
</P>
<P>
"From now on, when I think of Los Angeles, I'll think of the people and the 
history that has occurred here," said Mellondra Johnson, a Chicago delegate to 
the convention. "This isn't just a place where they have earthquakes, movie 
stars and gangs." 
</P>
<P>
Added Fannie Singletary: "People can be just as proud looking at the past as 
they are at looking ahead to improving the lives of all Americans." 
</P>
<P>
New York delegate Ray Jarvis said the tour proved to him that Americans across 
the land share in a similar history. 
</P>
<P>
"Chicago was founded by blacks, too," he said. "And New York has problems with 
housing and employment, just like here. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all the same."

FOCUS OF U.S. TRADE TENSION SHIFTS TO EUROPE 
</P>

<P>
Watch out, America. Europe is back. 
</P>
<P>
The 1980s, with the dawning of the era of the Pacific Rim, was a decade in 
which most of the economic attention -- and conflict -- between the United 
States and its trading partners centered on Japan and the growing export 
prowess of such Asian nations as South Korea and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
No longer. At least for now, Washington's trade problems with Japan and the 
rest of Asia are receding into the background. And tensions between Washington 
and some of its European allies are rising. 
</P>
<P>
A newly ebullient Western Europe is emerging from the pessimism that gripped it 
in the early 1980s. Its own impending economic integration in 1992 and Eastern 
Europe's plunge toward free markets are bound to make the United States and 
Europe ever more interdependent and prone to economic and trade fights. 
</P>
<P>
"With the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the sheer magnitude of the issues facing 
the United States in Europe are going to dominate the Administration's 
attention," says David Hale, an economic historian who heads Kemper Financial's 
economic research unit in Chicago. "At the same time, people have simply gotten 
tired of re-running the U.S.-Japan conflict over and over again." 
</P>
<P>
The quarrels between Washington and Europe will range from such small issues as 
steel quotas and growth hormones in cattle feed to far more fundamental 
disputes over farm subsidies, transatlantic investment and how best to absorb 
the crumbling Soviet Bloc into the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
"In terms of both policy challenges and business opportunities, most of the 
action in the 1990s will be in Europe," says Michael Aho, director of the 
international trade project at the Council of Foreign Relations in New York. 
"We still have problems with Japan, but many of them are decades old. 
Meanwhile, the European Community is changing the rules of the game." 
</P>
<P>
The seven-nation economic summit here provides telling evidence of just such a 
shift in focus. While U.S. officials had nothing but praise for Japan, the Bush 
Administration wasn't so kind or gentle with respect to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
As the summit opened Monday, both Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter and 
U.S. chief trade negotiator Carla A. Hills trained their big guns on the 
12-nation European Community's longstanding intransigence in the ongoing 
negotiations over its massive farm subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
"Our concern with . . . the European Community thus far is that they simply 
have not been engaged," Yeutter said. "We cannot negotiate with ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Going further, Yeutter directly challenged Europe's claim that its small 
farmers deserve special consideration. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is the community is not competitive in agriculture and that's why it 
does not prefer free trade. The community, of course, is strongly in favor of 
additional trade liberalization in areas where it is competitive," Yeutter 
said. "It's nice to be able to have your cake and eat it, too, if you can -- 
but that's really not the way the world works." 
</P>
<P>
When Hills weighed in, she was just as blunt. The dispute over agricultural 
trade, she said, pits the EC against "all exporting nations, of which the 
United States happens to be one. Could the United States be . . . more 
flexible, less stubborn, and succeed? The answer is no. Were we to not get 
fundamental reform . . . we would have 40 nations get up and leave these 
negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, even though public attention is still riveted on the potential 
economic threat from Asia, the decades-long trade dispute between Washington 
and Tokyo has moved to the back burner. 
</P>
<P>
"People may be far more concerned about Japan than the Europeans," said Alan 
Stoga, economic analyst at Kissinger Associates in New York, "but as far as the 
Bush Administration is concerned, the big strategic issues are in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
Last month's broad Structural Impediments Initiative (SII) agreement, which 
covered such wide-ranging issues as expanding public investment in Japan and 
shrinking the U.S. budget deficit, "concludes an era in U.S.-Japanese 
relations," said a senior Administration official. "It marks a real turning 
point in our relationship." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone is convinced that troubles in Asia are over. 
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental causes of trade friction between (Japan and the United States) 
have not been addressed," argues Clyde Prestowitz, a former U.S. trade official 
who now heads the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington. The SII agreement, 
he adds, creates "a false impression of solving problems when we should be 
preparing to manage continued bilateral tensions." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there's little doubt that the United States has not seen the last of 
its trade conflicts with Japan, which continues to maintain deeply entrenched 
business practices that serve to keep out foreign goods. "If the trade deficit 
with Japan starts widening again," said Stoga, "the issue will return with a 
vengeance." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, not only Washington but the whole world is clearly obsessed with 
the historic developments in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"Europe is at the dawn of a new era," trumpeted the seven summit nations in 
their political declaration Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
While unquestionably welcome, the economic revival of Europe will pose entirely 
new challenges for the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of the world understands better than we do that the world economic 
stage now has three elephants -- the U.S., Europe and Japan -- rather than just 
one," says the Foreign Relations Council's Aho. "Unless we develop a vision of 
how to deal with that, it could get pretty crowded up there."

FRUSTACIS SETTLE SUIT OVER BIRTH OF SEPTUPLETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Riverside couple and their three surviving septuplets on Tuesday settled 
their medical malpractice and wrongful-death lawsuit against a Los Angeles 
infertility clinic for up to $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Then an attorney made the startling announcement that the mother, Patti 
Frustaci, is pregnant with healthy twins after taking the same potent fertility 
drug that she took before conceiving the nation's first septuplets in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement with the Tyler Medical Clinic was reached over the strenuous 
objection of Dr. Jaroslav Marik, who treated Frustaci with the fertility drug 
Pergonal. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Marik was dismissed from the landmark lawsuit, which attorneys say 
is the nation's first court test involving the standard of care in fertility 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The doctor was removed from the suit because he would not agree to a 
settlement. He has said he was confident that a jury would vindicate him, but 
his insurance company was apparently unwilling to take that risk. Attorneys for 
the Frustaci family were seeking $12 million to $14 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
As terms of the agreement were read in Santa Monica Superior Court, Patti 
Frustaci wept quietly. Outside court, Frustaci described an "overwhelming" 
sense of relief after five years of litigation coupled with the stress of 
caring for three premature infants, who have health and developmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge David Rothman, who approved the settlement, had met with 
the Frustaci children -- Patti, Richard and Stephen -- on Monday to ascertain 
for himself their disputed condition. "The amount of money being paid is just 
under all the circumstances," the judge said Tuesday. "It is obvious to me . . 
. that the children are in need of this and would benefit from it." 
</P>
<P>
The husband, Sam Frustaci, an industrial products salesman from Riverside, was 
with the children on Monday but did not attend Tuesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Frustaci attorney Browne Greene described the 5-year-olds as severely impaired, 
with mental retardation and health problems, while the doctor's attorney, Craig 
Dummit, said only Stephen will have serious lifelong problems. 
</P>
<P>
The septuplets were delivered by Cesarean section at St. Joseph Hospital in the 
City of Orange. One was stillborn. Three others died within 19 days. The 
Frustacis also have an older son, Joseph, born 14 months before the septuplets 
after Marik treated Patti Frustaci with Pergonal. 
</P>
<P>
The Frustaci lawsuit contended Marik failed to properly monitor treatments and 
should not have completed the fertilization process, given her condition that 
month. 
</P>
<P>
During a news conference after the brief hearing, Greene said, "This is a very 
happy day for the Frustaci family." Then he announced that Patti Frustaci is 
two months' pregnant with a due date of Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her struggle in caring for the surviving septuplets, Frustaci, a 
35-year-old former schoolteacher, said she underwent further fertility 
treatment at another clinic in Southern California. "I desire to have another 
normal child," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of the settlement, the Frustacis will receive a $450,000 payment 
immediately. Beginning in August, the children will begin to receive monthly 
payments until their 18th birthdays. Stephen will receive $1,000 a month, 
Richard $600, and Patti, the healthiest from birth, $400. Those payments total 
$2.16 million, which is guaranteed even if the children die. 
</P>
<P>
After 18, the monthly payments for Stephen increase to $3,000. Richard will 
receive $2,000 and Patti $1,000 until death. If they reach a normal life 
expectancy of 71.2 years for males and 78.2 years for females, the settlement 
will amount to more than $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
The payouts will be made through the purchase of an annuity expected to cost 
more than $1 million in 1990 dollars, though Marik's attorney said it will cost 
less. 
</P>
<P>
Marik was not in court when the settlement was announced, but he later met with 
reporters. He said he felt like a student who had prepared for five years for 
an exam only to have it canceled. Marik said he recommended that Patti Frustaci 
take additional tests before fertilization. But he said Frustaci declined, 
citing the cost and inconvenience -- an allegation she denied. 
</P>
<P>
Marik said he did not interpret the settlement as a vote of no confidence in 
his treatment, but a practical dollars-and-cents decision not to risk the 
uncertainty of a jury verdict. The silver-haired infertility pioneer said he 
was not responsible for Frustaci's multiple births. "Why do you have to have 
somebody at fault? " he asked. "These things can happen." 
</P>
<P>
The settlement talks -- which took place over three tense days as jury 
selection started Monday -- were unusual, according to attorneys for both sides 
and legal experts. 
</P>
<P>
It is rare for an insurance company to negotiate a settlement without the 
consent of the insured, said medical malpractice attorney Bill Newkirk, who is 
not connected to the case. Newkirk said he had seen the situation only once 
before in his 16 years of experience and said it indicated to him that the 
plaintiff's case was strong. 
</P>
<P>
Marik, a co-owner and employee of the clinic, had blocked settlement talks 
since the case was filed in October, 1985. The way was cleared for settlement 
when a provisional clinic director recently was appointed in another court 
where Marik and his longtime partner, Dr. Stanley Friedman, are litigating over 
the dissolution of their practice. 
</P>
<P>
The court-appointed director voted with Friedman to allow settlement 
discussions. Marik's attorney, Dummit, was not involved in the talks and at 
most times paced the halls with reporters awaiting word of the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the settlement, Marik will not have a blemish on his record because he 
was dismissed as a defendant. But Marik said that publicity over the lawsuit 
has harmed his practice. He held up a crammed appointment schedule for 1984, 
then compared it to his sparse current schedule. 
</P>
<P>
The Riverside family has been in the limelight since Frustaci's pregnancy was 
announced in early 1985. People around the nation became involved in the 
waiting game to see if the pregnancy would continue until the fetuses had a 
chance of survival. Reporters and camera crews stood watch at St. Joseph 
Hospital in Orange, where Patti Frustaci was a patient for months. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the recommendation of her obstetrician that the fetuses had a slim 
chance of surviving until term, Frustaci, a Mormon, declined to have an 
abortion, for religious and moral reasons. 
</P>
<P>
After they were born, the watch shifted to Childrens Hospital of Orange County 
and became a death watch as the premature infants, tubes and ventilators 
covering their tiny bodies, struggled to survive. 
</P>
<P>
Patti Frustaci said this week that she will never get over the deaths of her 
four children. Outside her house, she said, she has planted four rose bushes -- 
colored peach, violet, yellow and red -- one for each dead child. She takes the 
blossoms to their graves. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Pergonal is a commonly used fertility drug made of the same hormones that 
naturally stimulate production of follicle cells in the ovaries. Since it 
bypasses a regulating gland in the brain and works directly on the ovaries, it 
increases the risk of multiple births. While only one follicle cell, from which 
a ripened egg emerges, usually matures in fertile women, multiple egg-producing 
follicles are stimulated in women treated with Pergonal.

CITY COUNCIL OKS MASSIVE PORTER RANCH DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday gave the go-ahead for construction of 
the massive Porter Ranch development in the hills above the northwestern San 
Fernando Valley, despite complaints that it will overtax the city's traffic, 
sewage and garbage systems. 
</P>

Porter Ranch, sometimes likened to a second Century City, will be one of the 
largest developments in the city's history. The $2-billion project will provide 
housing for 11,000 people and jobs for 20,000 when it is finished in the year 
2010. 
</P>
<P>
It will have 3,395 residences, including 2,195 single-family homes expected to 
range in price from $400,000 to $600,000. Six million square feet of commercial 
space will accommodate a handful of 10-story office buildings, a hotel and a 
regional shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of residents spoke against the project Tuesday during a nearly 
three-hour public comment period, but when it was the council's turn to debate, 
members showed little interest. After a tepid discussion, they approved the 
project 14 to 0 and sent it to Mayor Tom Bradley for his signature. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big project and there may not be another in Los Angeles this big ever," 
said Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores. "But the city and community is getting a 
lot out of this developer." 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said Tuesday that earlier concerns he had about the development -- 
which will alter the face of the foothills of the Santa Susana Mountains above 
Chatsworth -- had been met. 
</P>
<P>
Last December, the mayor had balked at the plan, forcing the Porter Ranch 
Development Co. to agree to several minor changes, including a requirement to 
set aside 200 residences for low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
About 40 million cubic yards of earth will be moved to make way for the 
development -- enough to fill the Rose Bowl 40 times. The developer will build 
six additional ramps to the Simi Valley Freeway, pave miles of new streets, and 
pay for synchronizing traffic signals at about 50 intersections outside the 
project itself. 
</P>
<P>
After the council vote, Roger Strull, a leader of the homeowner organization 
PRIDE, said his group will meet to consider a lawsuit to block the project on 
the grounds that the city violated environmental laws in approving the project. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel the vote was largely influenced by campaign contributions," said 
Strull. "The north Valley doesn't need another shopping center." 
</P>
<P>
"If we'd wanted to live in this type of area, we'd have moved to Century City, 
Warner Center or the Pavilion downtown," said Northridge businessman Walter 
Prince, echoing a common complaint sounded by the project's critics. 
</P>
<P>
Residents warned that the development will compound Los Angeles' water woes, 
while exhausting the city's municipal services and capacity to handle trash and 
traffic. Irwin Cohen of Northridge predicted that Porter Ranch would cause the 
city to "slide into a Third World situation like New York City." 
</P>
<P>
Despite these concerns, some saw in the project a silver lining in the 
improvements the developer will make. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the northwestern Valley, said he 
initially was worried about the estimated 150,000 daily auto trips that people 
destined to the commercial area will be taking. 
</P>
<P>
A study convinced him that after the developer pays more than $50 million for 
traffic improvements, including the computerized signals, street conditions in 
the area will actually be "better than they are now," Bernson said. 
</P>
<P>
Such expressions drew hoots of disbelief from foes of the project in the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
The council vote seemed to signal a setback for the slow-growth sentiment that 
had swelled in the late 1980s with passage of development-slashing Proposition 
U, which halved the amount of building possible on certain commercially zoned 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
Flores said she and her colleagues felt at ease voting for the project because 
Bernson and city planners made it "responsive" to community needs. 
</P>
<P>
Among amenities the developer will provide are a site for a library, a 50-acre 
park, low-income housing and a commitment to provide child-care facilities. 
"That's more than we get out of most development projects," said Flores. 
</P>
<P>
City Planning Department Director Kenneth Topping characterized Porter Ranch as 
an example of city planning that is sensitive to neighborhood concerns. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles should not cave in to the protests of a "relative few" and allow 
its planning to be driven "arbitrarily by public reaction," Topping said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite protests that have emerged during three years of planning the project, 
a call for a show of hands Tuesday in City Council chambers indicated that 
two-thirds of the 150 people who were present favored the project. 
</P>
<P>
The debate Tuesday was at times acrimonious, as dozens of residents trooped to 
the lectern to register their objections. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most tense moments arose when Jerry Raskin, a retired Pierce College 
professor, ticked off donations the developer or his immediate associates had 
made to council members. 
</P>
<P>
A 1989 survey by The Times found that the Porter Ranch Development Co., its 
affiliates, company officials, employees and family members had given $245,437 
since 1982 to council members and Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
As Raskin noted that Bernson had received more than $50,000 from the developers 
and Bradley more than $68,000, council President John Ferraro warned him to 
stay on the subject and threatened to cut off his microphone. 
</P>
<P>
The Porter Ranch proposal has had its ups and downs. A year ago, Bernson 
sharply reduced its scope by saying he would approve only 6 million square feet 
of commercial development -- 1 million less than the developer sought at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Bradley took a bite out of the project when he said he would not approve 
it as it was proposed. What resulted was a 25% reduction in parking spaces, an 
agreement for an internal transit system, and a commitment from the developer 
for a recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
The project overcame two other significant obstacles in the last six months. In 
January, the South Coast Air Quality Management District voiced its fear that 
the development would produce an imbalance in the neighborhood's 
jobs-to-housing ratio, leading to increased commuting and pollution. But after 
a second look, the state board gave the project clearance. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, the Los Angeles school district joined the chorus of opponents. 
School board member Julie Korenstein, who has considered running against 
Bernson, called Porter Ranch "senseless," saying it did not provide enough 
money for future schools for the area. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein was unable Tuesday to win sympathy from council members for her 
position. Bernson noted that a promise by the developer to set aside a 
seven-acre school site for the district until the year 2000 already exceeded 
anything the city could legally require. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, $17 million in developers fees will be collected to help pay for 
school construction. 
</P>
<P>
The project is 80% owned by Porter Ranch Development Co., a partnership of 
Shapell Industries and Liberty Buildings. The Shapell firm is headed by Nathan 
Shapell, who at 70 is perhaps one of the city's most politically influential 
housing developers.

SUMMIT AGREES TO SOVIET AID STUDY; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: SEVEN NATIONS WILL SEND A TEAM TO ASSESS MOSCOW'S NEEDS AND HELP IT 
BUILD A MARKET ECONOMY. FARM SUBSIDY ISSUE UNRESOLVED.

<P>
The United States and its major allies, seeking common ground on the issue of 
aid to the Soviet Union, agreed Tuesday to send an international team of 
experts to study that nation's failing economy and find ways to help Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev move toward a free market system. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, U.S. officials made it clear that, while President Bush 
continues to reject direct financial aid to Moscow, the final communique to be 
issued at the conclusion of the economic summit today will pose no obstacle to 
West German plans to give such assistance. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, this resolution of the issue fits the pattern of this summit: 
finding areas of broad agreement while allowing individual nations to go their 
own way on specific points. 
</P>
<P>
"The President has said at almost every opportunity he supports President 
Gorbachev in his reform efforts. We want to be of help. Other countries want to 
be of help," said Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. "They may do it in 
different ways." 
</P>
<P>
The announcement on aid to Moscow came as negotiators for the seven summit 
participants met late into the evening in a quest for compromise language on 
the question of eliminating farm subsidies, an issue that has created an 
impasse in the current global trade-liberalization talks known as the Uruguay 
Round. 
</P>
<P>
The United States wants the seven leaders to call for a speedup in efforts to 
complete the talks, but serious divisions exist over how far the summit leaders 
should go in ordering farm subsidies reduced. U.S. officials said President 
Bush intended to hold out for firm language on the issue and, as negotiations 
headed into the wee hours of this morning, they expressed optimism about the 
chances for success. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. effort had received a modest setback Tuesday when West German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who on Monday had backed Washington's position on the 
issue, bent in the face of heavy pressure from European Community President 
Jacques Delors. But West German officials said Kohl still intends to press for 
a compromise that would satisfy Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The summit leaders also agreed Tuesday to explore providing World Bank loans to 
help China reform its economy. But they denied that in considering such 
financial aid, they are using a different standard to judge China and the 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union is not a member of the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The summit nations, which at last year's annual meeting in Paris supported 
World Bank loans for China but solely for "basic human needs," declared that in 
light of "positive developments" in that country, they will explore whether 
other World Bank loans "would contribute to reform of the Chinese economy, 
especially loans that would address environmental concerns." 
</P>
<P>
Aid to China and the Soviet Union, among the most important and controversial 
issues being debated here, were addressed in a Political Declaration on 
Securing Democracy that the leaders issued Tuesday. The two topics dominated 
Tuesday morning's summit session, with the leaders spending the first half-hour 
discussing China, the next hour talking about the Soviet Union and the last 1 
hour and 15 minutes discussing trade. 
</P>
<P>
The summit leaders ordered their commission on the Soviet economic situation to 
make its report by year's end. The panel will include analysts from the World 
Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as Washington had proposed, as well 
as representatives from the newly formed European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 
(OECD), which the Europeans had wanted to head their own efforts. 
</P>
<P>
The work will be coordinated by the IMF, consulting closely with the 12-nation 
European Community, which has authorized its own study of the Soviet economy 
and is drawing on the resources of the European Bank and the OECD in that 
endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
The four European members of the economic summit -- Britain, France, West 
Germany and Italy -- also are members of the European Community. Besides the 
United States, Japan and Canada are the other participants in this week's 
summit. 
</P>
<P>
Brady said he had no idea what kind of aid to the Soviet Union might be 
recommended by the economic summit's study team, but he pointed out that Bush 
has approved technical assistance to the Soviets while opposing direct 
financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
A French spokesman said that during Tuesday's summit discussions, President 
Francois Mitterrand stressed that it is important that the offering of any aid 
to the Soviets not be "vexatious." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what Mitterrand meant, the spokesman said: "We must remember the Soviet 
Union is a sovereign country that could easily be humiliated. And that kind of 
humiliation must be avoided." 
</P>
<P>
Both Mitterrand and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher insisted that the 
European Bank be included in the study of the Soviet economy, fearing that 
Moscow might balk at the idea of being subjected to scrutiny solely by the 
World Bank and the IMF, which normally devote themselves to untangling the 
economies of small Third World debtor nations. The Soviet Union is a member of 
the European Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Although Bush went along with including the European Bank and the OECD, sources 
said the United States earlier had sought to limit the study team to 
representatives of the IMF and the World Bank because Washington has more 
influence over those institutions. 
</P>
<P>
In their political declaration, the summit leaders welcomed the Soviet Union's 
moves toward a democratic political system and toward reforming its economy 
along free-market lines, and committed themselves to working with that nation 
"to assist its efforts to create an open society, a pluralistic democracy and a 
market-oriented economy." 
</P>
<P>
"Such changes will enable the Soviet Union to fulfill its responsibilities in 
the community of nations founded on these principles," they declared. "We are 
heartened by indications that a constructive dialogue is under way between the 
Soviet government and the Baltic states, and we urge all sides to continue this 
dialogue in a democratic spirit." 
</P>
<P>
The declaration, which said that "Europe is at the dawn of a new era," also 
hailed the "profound and historic changes sweeping the Continent," and said the 
London Declaration on a Transformed North Atlantic alliance issued last week at 
the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit in London provides a 
new basis for cooperation among former adversaries in building a stable, secure 
and peaceful Europe. 
</P>
<P>
On China, the declaration cited recent positive developments in that nation but 
suggested that prospects for closer cooperation would be improved if Beijing 
would renew political and economic reform, particularly in the field of human 
rights. And the summit leaders agreed to maintain sanctions put into place at 
last year's summit, as modified in response to developments over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats and some Republicans in Congress have accused the Bush Administration 
of favoring China over the Soviet Union in extending aid to the former even 
though it has remained a repressive regime while the Soviets have moved toward 
democracy and freedom. 
</P>
<P>
Rejecting that criticism at a press conference where he discussed the summit's 
declaration, Secretary of State James A. Baker III noted that the summit 
nations still have sanctions against China and said, "The idea that somehow we 
are treating them (China) more liberally than we are the Soviet Union, I think, 
just doesn't wash. 
</P>
<P>
"From the standpoint purely of the United States," Baker added, "we have laws 
on the books that constrain what we can and cannot do insofar as the Soviet 
Union is concerned and, indeed, what our private sector can and cannot do." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the United States should "not lose sight of the fact that . 
. . there are no nuclear missiles targeted on the United States by China, as 
far as we know. So there is a different situation. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Administration's critics said Tuesday that they felt the language 
of the summit resolution on China was not as damaging to their position as they 
had expected. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of opening the way immediately for new loans to China, they said, the 
allies agreed to preserve for now the current policy of allowing loans only for 
"basic human needs." At the same time, the summit's communique clearly laid the 
groundwork for the World Bank to begin making other kinds of loans to China. 
</P>
<P>
"It's obviously a careful compromise," said former U.S. Ambassador to China 
Winston Lord, who has argued in the past that the Bush Administration was too 
eager to ease its sanctions against China. "I don't think we ought to be 
loosening up now, and I don't think it does loosen up too much. We'll have to 
see how it plays out in practice. Now, if this turns out to be a cover for 
everyone rushing ahead, I think that would be unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
So far, Japan is the one nation here that has declared itself. For several 
days, Japanese officials, including Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, have been 
saying that Japan will go forward with its own loans, no matter what the allies 
decide. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) criticized that position Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan is taking a short-term, unenlightened view of China for short-term 
gain," Pelosi said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Lord, Pelosi also said she viewed the summit communique as something of a 
compromise. "The doors were not just flung open for loans to China," she said. 
"But if they just use this as an excuse for new loans, I can see further 
battles ahead in Congress."

THEY SCOFF AT THE ROCK;

<P>

<P>
Barry Fell thinks the two-ton, marked-up rock he and his wife found on a recent 
beachcombing expedition is a kind of cablegram from the ancient world. 
</P>
<P>
Its message, according to Fell: 
</P>
<P>
Christopher Columbus was a Johnny-come-lately by at least 1,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
But scoffers -- and there are many -- believe Fell and his followers are on 
very rocky ground indeed, scientifically speaking. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at San Diego's Museum of Man have refused to put the boulder on 
display, even though Fell, a Harvard professor emeritus of marine biology, 
insists it is inscribed in ancient script that went out of use about AD 500. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Abbott, 49, a San Diego State University geology professor called in by 
the city to evaluate the find, has turned thumbs down on the discovery. 
</P>
<P>
About the only civic validation came when the city last month allowed members 
of Fell's Epigraphic Society to remove the three-foot-long rock from the beach 
and place it in storage. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. Fell remains unshaken in his beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
"Grooves in the rock in the shape of Numidian letters translate into the word 
'Tangy,' meaning people from Tangier, graffiti I'm certain was left by sailors 
from an ancient ship," said Fell. In 1974, he founded the Epigraphic Society, a 
rebel archeological group that studies writing in ancient European and North 
African languages it claims was chiseled on rocks and cave walls in America by 
pre-Columbian explorers. 
</P>
<P>
Fell, 73, the balding guru of the 1,000-member society, is used to skepticism 
from the American scientific Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon Willey, a Harvard professor, has called the society "escapism, fable, 
fantasy, fun." 
</P>
<P>
Ives Goddard, curator of the Smithsonian Institution's department of 
anthropology, labeled Fell's work "the linguistic equivalent of alchemy." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State geology professor Abbott says Fell is way off base with his 
interpretation of the scratches on the rock: "By close observation it is 
obvious the markings were made at different time periods, accidentally cut into 
the rock by the teeth of a machine that scoops up seaweed which piles up quite 
high in that area. If the grooves look like ancient writing, it is sheer 
coincidence." 
</P>
<P>
Fell shrugs it off. "We know we're right and they are wrong," he said. "We will 
keep gathering evidence until the scientific community finally realizes we're 
onto something extremely important to the history of America." 
</P>
<P>
Fell said he and his wife, Rene, were walking along the beach when they came 
upon the rock beneath a 65-foot-high cliff. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always looking for ancient writing on beach rocks, but every time I spot 
something I think is it, Barry tells me it's nothing," recalled Rene, who is 
secretary of the organization headquartered in their home. "Then I saw this 
rock." 
</P>
<P>
Fell admits that most rocks along the beach are scarred from the blades and 
teeth of seaweed removal equipment. "But this was different," he said. "I 
recognized it immediately as Numidian. There was no doubt in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Payn, vice president of the Epigraphic Society and owner of a chain of 
commercial art schools, flew recently to Tripoli, Libya, to show photos of the 
rock to Prof. Ali Khushaim, author of a book on ancient inscriptions and a 
faculty member of the Libyan Studies Center and Al-Sateh University. 
</P>
<P>
"The letters on the rock look like a Numidian word meaning a person from 
Tangier," Khushaim told The Times by phone. "Of course . . . I have not seen 
the rock. I cannot date it. But it appears to be an authentic ancient 
inscription. It was a habit of ancient sailors from North Africa to write one 
word or two words alone on rocks at places far away from home." 
</P>
<P>
Dawson and Fell are convinced that Irish and Arab explorers traveled old 
American Indian trade routes from the Pacific Coast across the Sierra to the 
Lone Pine area. The Irish would have been there about the time of Christ, the 
Arabs about AD 800, they theorize. How did they get there? 
</P>
<P>
"Same way as Columbus," Dawson said. "By ship. Ancient people weren't stupid. 
Despite popular belief, they sailed all the oceans of the world. They did not 
think the world was flat."

An Arab man suspected in the 1986 West Berlin disco bombing that killed an 
American soldier and sparked a U.S. air strike on Libya is in custody in East 
Berlin, West German security sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
They said the man was being held under a false name and on unrelated charges. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate confirmation from officials in East Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. soldier and a Turkish woman died in the April, 1986, attack on the La 
Belle discotheque in West Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
Then-President Ronald Reagan ordered air strikes against Libya, saying there 
was evidence Libyan leader Col. Moammar Kadafi was behind the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The Bonn sources were commenting on a report in the latest edition of the news 
magazine Stern, which said a man with an Arab name is being held under tight 
security because he is considered a prime witness in the case. 
</P>
<P>
According to the security sources, the man is suspected of taking part in the 
transport of the explosives used in the disco bombing. 
</P>
<P>
Stern also said East and West German police have been cooperating since May in 
the hunt for a Palestinian, Yasser Chraidi, who is suspected of belonging to a 
Libyan assassination squad operating in Berlin.

<P>
When the U.S. Supreme Court recently handed down its opinion in the Nancy 
Cruzan case, I thought of my friend, Carson Milligan of Costa Mesa. In some 
ways, Nancy and Carson are similar: both in an irreversible coma, both 
sustained by a feeding tube inserted into their stomachs and both with loving, 
devoted families. Both had their fates decided for them, and it is here that 
the differences are striking. 
</P>
<P>
Carson died on Father's Day after his feeding tube was removed by the hospital 
and doctors, who agreed with his family that the tube met none of the proper 
goals of medicine: cure, comfort or care. It was merely prolonging his death, 
not enhancing his life. 
</P>
<P>
Those who loved Carson knew he would not have wanted that. Carson had the good 
fortune to have talked about his wishes with his family before a ruptured 
aneurysm snuffed out his vibrant life. He also lived in California, a state 
that allows families to make decisions for incompetent patients based on their 
previously expressed wishes, or in their best interests if their wishes are 
unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Things are different in Missouri, where Nancy Cruzan still lies in the dark 
space between life and death. There, the state Supreme Court has ruled that the 
state is in a better position to decide what Nancy would want than her parents 
because she left no "clear and convincing evidence" of her wishes. The U.S. 
Supreme Court found no constitutional right of Nancy or her parents that would 
forbid Missouri from holding this position. 
</P>
<P>
The Missouri opinion is contrary to that of about all the other states that 
have ruled on this matter. It also seems extremely counterintuitive because 
most people say they would not want to be kept alive with a feeding tube if 
there were no hope for their return to consciousness. But such is the problem 
of deciding these issues in the courts: human needs get lost in legal 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
What can we do to avoid similar problems? There are no guarantees, but I offer 
some suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
For individuals: 
</P>
<P>
* Think about it. Are there limits to the treatment you would want? Do you have 
some general guidelines that you want followed? Under what circumstances would 
you want or not want your life prolonged? 
</P>
<P>
* Talk about it. We need to move conversations about death and dying from a 
taboo subject to a part of every family's agenda. If a loved one has to make 
critical decisions for someone else, it is a comfort and empowerment to know 
what they want. 
</P>
<P>
* Fill out a durable power of attorney for health care. This legal document 
enables us to express our wishes and name a person to make medical decisions on 
our behalf. California Health Decisions, a grass-roots organization, conducts 
workshops and has forms available. Their number is: (714) 647-4925. 
</P>
<P>
For health professionals: 
</P>
<P>
* Take the initiative to ask patients about their wishes before a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
* Have materials available in doctors' offices, hospitals and nursing homes to 
assist patients and families in thinking about the range of choices that are 
available to them. 
</P>
<P>
* Develop policies and guidelines governing the use of life-sustaining 
procedures and make them known. 
</P>
<P>
* Establish an ethics committee to help patients and health professionals 
resolve difficult cases. 
</P>
<P>
For public officials: 
</P>
<P>
* Ensure that the bonds of family and familiarity remain the gauge of patients' 
wishes and best interests. Sensitive matters about when and how a patient dies 
are ordinarily best made at the bedside, not in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Carson Milligan's family had the great comfort of knowing that they did what he 
would have wanted. They were able to grieve within the supportive circle of 
their many friends. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Cruzan's parents bear the double tragedy of losing her and of being 
prevented from carrying out what they know would be her wishes. They are also 
forced to deal with their grief in public and with the devastating accusation 
from some quarters that they are trying to kill their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
In this litigious, death-denying culture, it is getting harder to remember that 
dying is a natural part of the human story. Once we get that straight, we'll be 
better able to recognize the transition that comes for each patient: the time 
when what they need far more than life-prolonging technology is our caring 
presence.

SEATTLE TV STATION DEFENDS MARINER CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Seattle Mariner owner Jeff Smulyan brought a ballpark full of ideas with him 
when he began trying last fall to sweeten the baseball club's television 
contract with Tacoma-based KSTW, including a proposal that the station pay for 
a free-agent first baseman, the station said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
In a counterclaim to the Mariners' lawsuit last month seeking to get out of the 
three-year TV deal, the station's attorneys Monday said Smulyan, among other 
things, demanded KSTW put up "in excess of $1 million" to sign then-Boston Red 
Sox slugger Nick Esasky. 
</P>
<P>
From the first time they met, Smulyan told KSTW officials he wanted to 
"terminate, revise or renegotiate the agreement in order to increase revenues 
... at the expense of KSTW," according to a news release distributed Monday by 
the station. 
</P>
<P>
Smulyan also demanded KSTW turn over advertising sales to the club and that the 
third year of the deal, covering the 1991 season, be canceled, station 
spokeswoman Leslie Donovan said in the release. 
</P>
<P>
The owner also asked to reopen the terms of the 1990 season to require the 
station to pay more for the broadcast rights, the statement read. 
</P>
<P>
Mariners attorney William Cronin, Smulyan and other team officials could not be 
reached for comment Monday. Baseball traditionally shuts down nearly all 
operations during its annual midsummer All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
The team filed lawsuit in King County Superior Court on June 15 seeking an 
escape from the contract on the grounds KSTW failed to build a region-wide 
network of stations to broadcast Mariners games from Alaska to Utah. 
</P>
<P>
The team's lawsuit specifically alleged KSTW cut its broadcast schedule in the 
Spokane area from 46 games last year to 11 this season to avoid having games 
broadcast over a competitor's station. That hampered the team's efforts to 
build an Eastern Washington following, the club claimed. 
</P>
<P>
KSTW-TV general manager and vice president Kevin Hale, who called Smulyan's 
demands "intimidation tactics," said viewership is at an all-time high this 
season over a network that stretches from Salt Lake City to Anchorage to 
Honolulu and includes Spokane, Yakima and the Tri-Cities. 
</P>
<P>
Smulyan's attempt to break the contract is "not a result of any substantial 
failures or material breach by KSTW; instead, the action represents ... 
Smulyan's bad faith attempt to obtain economic benefits by controlling 
advertising revenues with 'an in-house' operation and his economic 
dissatisfaction with the agreement," the station's release said. 
</P>
<P>
Compared with TV deals held by some other clubs, such as the New York Yankees' 
10-year, $500 million arrangement with WABC, Smulyan has plenty reason to be 
unhappy, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
The Mariners' KSTW deal, negotiated under the regime of former owner George 
Argyros by former club president Chuck Armstrong, gives the club $50,000 for 
the 1990 season and $75,000 for next year, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
There also is a series of incentives, topping out at $100,000 to the club from 
the station if the team wins the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
In 13 years, the Mariners never have finished with a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
The contract also calls for KSTW to provide the team $115,000 worth of free 
advertising during the course of each season, and clears five minutes of air 
time each game to allow the team to sell beer advertising. 
</P>
<P>
KSTW may have won over the support of baseball fans with the news that it 
balked at signing Esasky, however. He hit 30 home runs and drove in 108 last 
year for the Red Sox and signed a reported three-year, $5.7 million contract 
with the Atlanta Braves last November. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, the slugger has been on the disabled list since April due to a 
bizarre problem with vertigo. 
</P>
<P>
No court dates other than a January 1992 trial date have been set. The Mariners 
are seeking a hearing in October as soon as the season ends, while KSTW wants a 
court order barring the team from interfering with advertising sales and 
forcing it live up to the remainder of the contract.

MAXWELL ORDERED TO SELL OFF HIS BELL GROUP STOCK

British publisher Robert Maxwell has been forced to put his stake in Bell Group 
Ltd. back on the market under terms of an out-of-court settlement with the 
National Companies and Securities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Court on Tuesday ratified the order to dispose of the 14.9% holding 
in the group, declaring Bell Director David Aspinall was in breach of takeover 
regulations when he originally acquired the shares. 
</P>
<P>
Australian financier Robert Holmes a Court is believed to be among potential 
bidders interested in the parcel of more than 54 million shares in the group, 
which owns the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
The stock will be tendered at a confidential reserve price. 
</P>
<P>
If a buyer cannot be found at or above the price agreed with the NCSC, then the 
shares will be returned to Maxwell. 
</P>
<P>
Commission officials alleged that Aspinall had breached the takeover code in 
his original purchase of a 16.57% Bell holding because he was deemed to be as 
associate of the company's 74.5% parent, Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
The order to put the shares back on the market resulted from an out-of-court 
settlement Tuesday among the NCSC, Aspinall and Maxwell.

NL'S SOGGY BATS PRODUCE 2 HITS AS AL WINS, 2-0 
</P>

<P>
On a traditional Wrigley Field night of wet ivy and stiff winds Tuesday, 
baseball's 61st All-Star game produced a new murderers' row. 
</P>
<P>
Their names are Bob Welch, Dave Stieb, Bret Saberhagen, Bobby Thigpen, Chuck 
Finley and Dennis Eckersley. They are American League pitchers who murdered the 
National League's best bats, giving up only two hits in leading the AL to a 2-0 
victory before 39,071. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fewest hits by one team in All-Star game history, and only the sixth 
shutout. 
</P>
<P>
In a game twice delayed by rain for a total of 1 hour 23 minutes, the biggest 
pause occurred in the National League offense. Only four batters reached base. 
At one point, 16 consecutive batters were retired. The NL struck out six times 
and hit only 10 balls out of the infield, including the two hits. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco's Will Clark blooped a two-out single up the middle against 
Oakland's Welch in the first inning, and Philadelphia's Lenny Dykstra hit a 
line-drive single off Oakland's Eckersley to lead off the ninth. In between, 
only walks to San Diego's Tony Gwynn and Pittsburgh's Barry Bonds marred the AL 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
The AL got only seven hits against an All-Star game record nine NL pitchers, 
but they needed only one, a two-run double by Texas' Julio Franco after a 1:08 
rain delay in the seventh inning. Franco was voted the game's most valuable 
player. 
</P>
<P>
"We are coming into the All-Star game with a little different attitude these 
days," said Kansas City's Saberhagen, who was the winning pitcher with two 
perfect innings. 
</P>
<P>
"We have all heard how the National League is a better league, so we are coming 
in here to win games. 
</P>
<P>
"And we have some good pitchers. Mike Boddicker isn't here, and Roger Clemens 
didn't even pitch. So we have even better than we showed tonight." 
</P>
<P>
This was the AL's third consecutive All-Star victory, and fourth in the last 
five games. Overall they still trail in the series, 37-23-1. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the rain and the 16-m.p.h. winds blowing in from Lake Michigan, the NL 
hitters came up with some All-Star excuses. 
</P>
<P>
"Hitting was difficult tonight not just because of the rain, but also because 
you don't know the pitchers and you see so many different guys coming in and 
out," said San Francisco's Clark, who followed his single with two groundouts. 
"I wish we could have had a few (innings) more." 
</P>
<P>
Said Giant teammate Kevin Mitchell: "I definitely think the pitchers had an 
advantage in the All-Star game. Not only are you facing a guy who you've never 
been before, but he knows that he's only going to have to be out there for an 
inning or two." 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, who went hitless in two at-bats, was struck out by AL starter Welch 
to end the first inning with Clark on first. The Chicago Cubs' Ryne Sandberg 
stranded pinch-runner Barry Larkin of Cincinnati on second base by grounding 
out to third against Toronto's Stieb in the third. 
</P>
<P>
In the ninth, Eckersley kept Dykstra on first base by retiring San Diego's 
Roberto Alomar on a fly ball to center, striking out San Francisco's Matt 
Williams looking and retiring Tim Wallach on a foul pop to first base. 
</P>
<P>
With such pitching, the AL needed only one productive inning, which lasted more 
than an hour because of the rain. 
</P>
<P>
With showers growing heavier, the AL seventh began with Cleveland's Sandy 
Alomar Jr. sliding across first base to beat out a grounder to shortstop 
against San Francisco relief pitcher and loser Jeff Brantley. The Angels' Lance 
Parrish then followed with a perfect hit-and-run ground single to right field. 
</P>
<P>
Brantley was preparing to face Franco when play finally was stopped. It was the 
game's second delay; the opening pitch was 15 minutes late because of the rain. 
This was only the fourth All-Star game to be affected by rain. 
</P>
<P>
During the seventh-inning break, Brantley developed a stiff shoulder and, upon 
resumption of play, he was replaced by Cincinnati's Rob Dibble. Franco fell 
behind 0-and-2 to the hard-throwing Dibble before hitting a fastball into the 
right-center-field gap for a double, scoring Alomar and Parrish, who stumbled 
down the third base line but still crossed the plate without sliding. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he was going to throw the fastball because he had been warming up for 
20 minutes, and I was stiff," Franco said. "I was looking at him warming up and 
saw that he had a lot of body motion. Everybody said he threw hard, so I just 
tried to get it to right field. " 
</P>
<P>
The inning ended with one of the game's few classic confrontations. It occurred 
after Franco took third on a grounder by the Chicago White Sox's Ozzie Guillen 
and Toronto's Kelly Gruber walked and stole second. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland's Jose Canseco then hit a fly ball to right fielder Darryl Strawberry. 
As Strawberry caught the ball, Franco tagged third base and raced for home. 
Strawberry's throw to Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia reached him on a line and 
Scioscia, blocking the plate as always, tagged out Franco for the double play. 
</P>
<P>
Another NL hero was Dodger pitcher Ramon Martinez, who had an eventful third 
inning, which he completed by retiring Canseco on a grounder with runners on 
first and second. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez replaced starter Jack Armstrong of Cincinnati in the third. Armstrong 
gave up one hit in two innings, after becoming the first pitcher to start an 
All-Star game in his first full major league season since the Dodgers' Fernando 
Valenzuela in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
With one out in the third and New York Yankee Steve Sax on second after a walk 
and a stolen base, Martinez struck out Oakland's Rickey Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Up stepped Boston's Wade Boggs, who was intentionally walked. Why? So Martinez 
could face Canseco. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Canseco is a home-run hitter, but I know Boggs has a better chance of 
driving in a run in that situation," National League Manager Roger Craig said. 
"I'm trying to win a game." 
</P>
<P>
His strategy worked as Canseco grounded out meekly to Sandberg.

RAMS' CAMP TO OPEN IN EXPERIMENTAL MODE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Finding themselves submerged in a dynasty not their own, the Rams will open a 
training camp for rookies today knowing that all good things and teams must 
end. So is this the year or will San Francisco party again? 
</P>
<P>
More anxious than even Steve Young for quarterback Joe Montana to retire, the 
Rams are rebounding from their championship game knockout last January to 
presume again that the best days of the 49ers too shall pass, preferably 
against someone else's defensive secondary. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams were quite the compliment collectors after last season's entertaining 
title run, emerging as possibly the NFL's second-best team -- small 
consolation. 
</P>
<P>
For sanity's sake, the Rams pretend not to notice their northern rivals in 
July, prefering self-examination. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they're the issue," Coach John Robinson said of the 49ers, 
resurrecting a familiar training camp tone. "I think they're the issue for 
external people, not for us. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to start this year -- and win the championship this year -- against 
all of the teams that we play. What we're striving to do is become a 
championship-level football team, not just focus on beating one team." 
</P>
<P>
Come December, though, the teams are inevitably linked because of their 
distinct rivalry and a divisional title they seek each season. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, in fact, calculates precisely a San Francisco mean streak that has 
produced consecutive Super Bowl titles. He notes accurately that the 49ers have 
won 24 of their last 27 games since a midseason slump in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"And we're two of those losses," he adds. "And certainly there was another one 
of those we could have won. We've played them four times (during the regular 
season) in that period and won twice. And it's been a phenomenal period, but it 
won't go on. But we cannot spend our time looking at someone else. We must 
spend our time looking at ourselves and improving ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Still, each measure of self-improvement is always in part a response to the 
maneuverings of the 49ers. The difference is that the Rams play their game of 
chess with limited funds, looking for garage-sale bargains while the 49ers 
spend money from their owner's fancy shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
This past off-season, the Rams signed free-agent quarterback Chuck Long, a 
former sore-armed, first-round draft choice of the Detroit Lions who never 
panned out. If Long pays off in Anaheim, he's the insurance policy answer to 
Young, San Francisco's talented backup. Young earns $1 million a season; Long, 
$400,000. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Robinson reached into the Plan B market, plucking tailback Curt Warner 
from Seattle, where he gained only 631 yards last season. At his best, Warner 
was among the game's elite runners. At 29, he battles doubts and leg injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is hoping that Warner, a passionate player and leader, will replace 
the emotionless statistical offerings of Greg Bell, who gained few yards in the 
clubhouse diplomacy game. Robinson sent Bell to the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
The Warner experiment, too, was cost-effective. They'll pay him less than 
$800,000 for the chance he'll bring to the Rams what veteran John Riggins 
brought to Washington after a late-career trade from the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be a mistake," Robinson said of the Warner deal. "But I don't think 
it's a gamble. It didn't cost us anything. We didn't pay anything. We didn't 
give away a draft choice. Sports has millions of outstanding players who 
somebody said they're careers were over. Then, they make a move and there's an 
immediate resurgence. One could say that the jury's out. But it's not 
ill-conceived. It has a chance for some real success." 
</P>
<P>
If Warner fails or is injured, the running load is plopped into the lap of 
inexperience. Cleveland Gary's rookie season was a wash in 1989 after he 
reported to camp less than a week before the opener. Gaston Green's career has 
been a wash since the Rams made him their top pick in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson insists that Green has matured as a runner and will get a shot this 
summer. But time is running out on this costly investment. 
</P>
<P>
"For us it is," Robinson admitted. "I don't mean that as any kind of threat or 
anything. We've either got to use him or find a way for him to get somewhere 
where he can use his strengths. No question, he is physically different now 
than when he came. He wants desperately to play, (and) we're going to try to 
give him that opportunity. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to have to wait and see. Who knows about injuries? There's 
some question about Curt. Some people say he's all washed up. You don't know. 
There are three guys. I have three tailbacks all trying to prove themselves 
this year. So we will have some healthy competition." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing on offense compares to the competition on defense, where waves of young 
talent fight for a few positions. The Rams ranked 21st overall on defense and 
28th against the pass, although serious and numerous injuries last season 
muddled the true picture a bit. The Rams played the title game without six top 
defenders, but vast improvement on defense remains a must if the Rams wish to 
contend. In short, the wealth of talent acquired in the drafts of 1988 and '89 
must soon produce. The Rams were fortunate last season to get quality time from 
free-agent linebacker Brett Faryniarz and seventh-round linebacker George 
Bethune. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the young defenders on the hot-seat this season are linebacker Frank 
Stams, safety Anthony Newman and linemen Bill Hawkins and Brian Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to improve," Robinson said. "But I like the cast of 
characters. There's just a lot of unproven people. The scary thing would be to 
have a mediocre group and have them all back." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson envisions multiple defensive schemes and alignments this season to 
take advantage of all his personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, for example, have a strong run defense led by nose man Alvin Wright 
and ends Doug Reed and Mike Piel. But that unit gets burned too often on 
first-down passes. Robinson hopes to improve the situation by using either one 
or both of his twin towers, Smith and Hawkins, on early downs. Both are 
6-feet-6 and about 270 pounds. Hawkins and Smith also will team up as inside 
rushers on passing downs, and the hope is that the tandem will take some 
pressure off the secondary and the team's only true pass-rusher, Kevin Greene. 
</P>
<P>
"Our outside rush is OK," Robinson said. "Inside is where we need the help. In 
Minnesota, for example, (Keith) Millard is coming at you with the pass rush all 
the time. We're going to try to move in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Rams signed their 10th-round choice, defensive end Stephen Bates, Tuesday. 
He and sixth-round receiver Tim Stallworth are the only draft chices to sign so 
far. Bates, from James Madison, may be tried at linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Safety Anthony Newman (elbow), defensive end Doug Reed (ankle), safety Vince 
Newsome (ankle) and defensive tackle Mike Piel (elbow) have recovered fully 
from injuries suffered late last season, Coach John Robinson said. Defensive 
tackle Bill Hawkins still isn't 100% after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery 
in December, but he is expected to be practicing at full speed by Aug. 1. The 
news isn't so good for third-year cornerback Cliff Hicks, who suffered knee 
damage last season. He is not expected back until September at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
Two roster positions open this summer are at fourth wide receiver and punter. 
Veteran Hank Ilesic and rookie Kent Elmore figure to battle for Dale Hatcher's 
old punting job. . . . The veterans will report to training camp at UC Irvine 
on July 26. The Rams were forced out of Cal State Fullerton this year because 
construction has begun on a campus sports complex. . . . The team will spend 
two weeks at Rams Park before opening camp in Irvine, then leave a week later 
for an Aug. 11 exhibition game against the Kansas City Chiefs in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are the first NFL team to report to camp. It might be a while before 
the team's top three draft choices -- Bern Brostek, Pat Terrell and Latin Berry 
-- agree to terms. The Rams also have seven conditional free-agent veterans yet 
to sign, most notably Pro Bowl linebacker Kevin Greene, who has recorded 33 
sacks over the last two seasons. The others are linebacker Brett Faryniarz, 
tight ends Pete Holohan and Damone Johnson, safety Michael Stewart, nose tackle 
Alvin Wright and defensive end Doug Reed.

OLYMPIC FESTIVAL: BUT INDIANA BASKETBALL LEGEND DAMON BAILEY CARES ABOUT ONLY 
ONE OPINION -- THAT OF BOBBY KNIGHT.

<P>
There have been plenty of spectacular players in the U.S. Olympic Festival's 
basketball games this week. But Damon Bailey hadn't been one of them until 
Tuesday when his 25 points led the North in its 121-120 gold medal game defeat 
by the South. 
</P>
<P>
Bailey's legend lives. 
</P>
<P>
Outside Indiana, only one thing about Bailey is known for sure: In 1986, 
Indiana University Coach Bob Knight said Bailey was better than Steve Alford. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Alford was Indiana's star guard, and Bailey was an eighth-grader 
in Heltonville, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Knight's comments were published in the best-selling book, "A Season on the 
Brink," in which author John Feinstein chronicled a season with Knight's 
Indiana basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
A larger-than-life reputation started there. The rest, the 6-foot-3, 193-pound 
Bailey brought on himself. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to become the leading scorer in the history of Indiana high school 
basketball. 
</P>
<P>
During his career, the movie "Hoosiers" captured Indiana's love affair with the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
With that as a backdrop, Bailey last March played out his own rendition of the 
movie's final scene. 
</P>
<P>
Before 41,046 at the Indiana Hoosier Dome, Bailey led Bedford North Lawrence 
High to its first state championship, scoring his team's last 11 points to 
erase a six-point deficit in the final 2:38. 
</P>
<P>
Much to the surprise of some who watched him play in the Olympic Festival this 
week, Bailey never duplicated the feat until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
He averaged 16 points, made 57% of his shots -- including 11 of 16 three-point 
attempts -- and passed for 18 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Until the championship game, in which he was five for five from three-point 
range, he never drew much of a rise out of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure some people say I'm not the player everyone said I was, but I don't 
take much stock in what other people think," Bailey said the other day. "Just 
as long as Coach Knight thinks I can play the game. That's the only man I have 
to impress right now." 
</P>
<P>
Back home, there is no escape from admirers even when Bailey steps away from 
the court. 
</P>
<P>
"My girlfriend and I can't go out to the mall or to a movie simply because 
people would always be talking to us," Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular topic of conversation right now concerns Bailey's chances of 
leading the Hoosiers back to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the kind of stuff I worry about," said Pat Graham, a former high school 
rival of Bailey's who will be a teammate next season. "I just hope people in 
the state of Indiana and elsewhere won't be too hard on him." 
</P>
<P>
Graham, who preceded Bailey as Indiana's Mr. Basketball, fears that Hoosier 
fans may be expecting more than a mere mortal can deliver. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not the type of player who is going to come into Indiana next year and 
dominate like some people might think," Graham said. "He's not going to be a 
guy who averages 30 points a game, but he is going to help us win." 
</P>
<P>
Louisiana State's Dale Brown, coach of the South team, expressed a similar 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"Damon is quick and smart, but what I like most about him is his mental 
toughness," Brown said. "He's not real flashy, but he'll beat you. He wills 
victory." 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, comparisons are still being made between Bailey and Alford. 
</P>
<P>
"Skill-wise, he is better right now than Alford was when he graduated," Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Vitale, basketball analyst for ESPN, agreed: "He's a more complete player 
coming in than Steve Alford. The only thing Steve did better was shoot from the 
outside. Every time he came off the screen, you knew he would tickle the 
twine." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said he once thought Bailey was overrated, after scouting him in high 
school. Not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"The more I see him against better competition, the better he gets," Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Graham said Brown's first reaction was understandable. 
</P>
<P>
"If you like players who help their team win, then there is no way you'd say 
Damon is overrated," Graham said. "But people expect the spectacular from him 
because of all the publicity he's gotten. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want Magic Johnson-type things, Damon is not your man." 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, observers say Bailey has remained humble and polite. Graham 
said his friend remains "just a good old guy." 
</P>
<P>
But Bailey is growing tired of attention. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, it's fun, but it gets old real quick," he said. "It's been the same 
for four years. I've gotten used to it." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Bailey said he has never regretted Knight's words. Or the fact he has 
lived up to them. 
</P>
<P>
"You make adjustments," he said. "I've had a lot of success. It's been worth 
giving up going out and all that other stuff. I'm willing to pay the price."

Emily Short turned in another outstanding performance Tuesday night, breaking 
the U.S. Olympic Festival record in the 200-meter breaststroke by more than 
four seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Short, 14, who Monday night swam the second-fastest 100 breaststroke in the 
world this year, finished the 200 in 2 minutes 32.71 seconds. The previous 
festival record of 2:36.83 was set in 1987 by Laura Gandrud of Bloomington, 
Minn. 
</P>
<P>
"I now feel I have more of a chance (to make the '92 Olympic team) than I did a 
week ago," said Short, of Phoenix. "I'm more positive about it now than after 
last night. I just have to work a lot harder than I have been." 
</P>
<P>
Sean Gouldson of Chelmsford, Mass., won the 100 backstroke in 57.37 seconds, 
breaking the festival record of 57.51 set by Rick Carey in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Eight festival swimming records were set in the three days of competition. 
</P>
<P>
Travis Ford's layup with seven seconds left gave the South a 121-120 victory 
over the North in the gold-medal basketball game, and after the bronze-medal 
game, Princeton Coach Pete Carril declared he had had enough of all-star teams. 
</P>
<P>
The East women beat the West, 76-54, for the gold. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, a guard at Missouri, finished with 24 points to lead the South, which won 
despite a low-scoring night from 7-foot-1 Shaquille O'Neal of LSU. O'Neal had 
89 points in the first three games but scored only nine on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Damon Bailey, whose three-pointer had given the North a 120-119 lead with 17 
seconds remaining, led his team with 25. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's game, the East broke away quickly at the start of each half in 
rolling to victory. Tracy Lis of Providence led the winners with 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
In the bronze medal games, the East men beat the West, 101-98, and the North 
women beat the South, 76-74, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
After his team won the bronze, Carril said: 
</P>
<P>
"No offense to the guys on my team, but this makes me appreciate my players (at 
Princeton). These guys worry too much about how many minutes they're going to 
play, who's going to take the shot, who's going to do this. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them yesterday, 'You guys sleep together, you stay in the same dorm, 
you eat together and yet when guys are wide open, you pass them up.' " 
</P>
<P>
In archery, 46-year-old Barry Weinperl set a final-round Grand FITA record with 
334 points after almost not qualifying for the six-man finals. 
</P>
<P>
Weinperl's victory marked the second consecutive year the oldest archer has won 
the event. In 1989, Ed Eliason of Stansbury Park, Utah, won it at age 50. 
</P>
<P>
Weinperl's score for 36 arrows eclipsed the previous final-round record of 332 
by Jay Barrs of Tempe, Ariz., in 1987.

CBS WEATHERS ITS PRIME-TIME BASEBALL DEBUT 
</P>

<P>
Well, at least there was more scoring than in the World Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
But the 2-0 All-Star game wasn't much more exciting than Sunday's 1-0 soccer 
game. 
</P>
<P>
However, the television coverage of Tuesday night's rain-delayed game overall 
was pretty good, and not merely because CBS didn't miss any live action because 
of commercials. 
</P>
<P>
This was CBS' first prime-time baseball telecast, and the network showed it can 
cover the sport. 
</P>
<P>
With Vin Scully or Al Michaels in the play-by-play seat, there no doubt would 
have been more anecdotes. There was sure plenty of time for storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
But the announcing team of Jack Buck and Tim McCarver is easy to listen to. 
Buck's laid-back style goes well with McCarver's delivery. 
</P>
<P>
If CBS can be criticized, it's for overdoing things a bit. Did we really need 
all those dugout interviews, even at the expense of some live action? 
</P>
<P>
You knew CBS was pulling out all stops early when you saw that CBS baseball 
promo that has Tom Lasorda blowing kisses to the tune of the Temptations' "Get 
Ready." 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the telecast was the Nike commercial with a lot of Bo Jacksons 
and one Sonny Bono. 
</P>
<P>
Says one of the Jacksons, "What are you doing here?" 
</P>
<P>
Says Bono, "I thought this was another one of those Bono's (or Bo knows) 
commercials." 
</P>
<P>
Someone should earn a Bo-nus for that one. 
</P>
<P>
One thing that didn't work, as things turned out, was the takeoff on the famous 
Ernie Banks quote during the pregame show. "I never thought I'd say this," 
Banks said on tape, "but it's a beautiful night for a ballgame. Let's play 
two!" 
</P>
<P>
Well, on this night, they could barely get in one. 
</P>
<P>
At the start, Buck, who rarely gets carried away, did a little, reciting such 
cliches as, "Gentlemen, start your engines," and "The horses are in the 
starting gate." 
</P>
<P>
As Buck himself noted, a simple "Play ball" will suffice. 
</P>
<P>
CBS had Pat O'Brien all over the place -- on the Wrigley rooftop, in the 
inner-workings of the old scoreboard, across the street at a fan's house, and 
in Harry Caray's booth, where he asked this penetrating question: "What does 
having the All-Star game mean to Chicago?" 
</P>
<P>
Of the scoreboard, O'Brien said, "It may be a dinosaur, but I don't know one 
kid who doesn't like dinosaurs." O'Brien must be a fan of the comic strip 
Calvin and Hobbs. Young Calvin, as his many fans know, is obsessed with 
dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
CBS even had O'Brien prod Bill Murray into singing happy birthday to Andre 
Dawson, who was celebrating his 36th. 
</P>
<P>
McCarver summed things up in the sixth inning, saying: "It's been a terrible 
offensive display so far." 
</P>
<P>
Then came the rain, and "Rescue 911" as a fill-in. It was a lot more intriguing 
than the game.

SMOKED OPIUM WITH BARRY, WITNESS SAYS 
</P>

<P>
An Iranian-born restaurateur who says that he supplied Mayor Marion Barry with 
cocaine at least 30 times testified Tuesday that he also smoked opium with 
Barry on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
The testimony of Hassan Mohammadi marked the second mention of opium at Barry's 
trial on 14 charges of perjury and cocaine use. Rasheeda Moore, the former 
model who lured Barry into an FBI sting operation, also testified that she had 
smoked opium with the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi, in his second day on the witness stand, said that he and Barry first 
smoked opium at Mohammadi's Georgetown apartment in February, 1988, putting the 
drug on the back of a spoon and warming it with a plumber's torch. They used a 
straw to inhale the fumes, he told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that he had introduced Barry to opium about three years after 
the two began sniffing cocaine in powdered form. Opium, an ancient drug that is 
the raw material for morphine and heroin, is "very popular" in Iran, he said. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson permitted the testimony about opium 
over the objections of Barry's lawyers, who argued that it was irrelevant and 
prejudicial. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that Barry seemed to enjoy using opium as well as cocaine and 
that the mayor often would telephone him to ask: "Do you have anything?" If he 
had drugs in his possession, Mohammadi said, the two would arrange to meet. 
</P>
<P>
"But sometimes I would tell Mr. Mayor, 'No, I don't have anything,' " the 
witness said. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that he never charged Barry for drugs but assured the mayor: "I 
am not looking for any favors." 
</P>
<P>
He testified: "I was a true friend for Mr. Mayor; I was always there for Mr. 
Mayor." 
</P>
<P>
On one occasion, Mohammadi said, he pulled an opium-caked spoon out of his 
automobile and the two smoked the residue. He said that Barry, for variety, 
sometimes would lace marijuana cigarettes with cocaine before smoking them, 
referring to such concoctions as "M. B. specials," after his initials. 
</P>
<P>
Barry is facing three perjury charges for having denied to a federal grand jury 
that he had used cocaine with another friend and former city employee, Charles 
Lewis, in December, 1988. Lewis has told jurors at Barry's trial that he 
repeatedly used cocaine with the mayor at the downtown Ramada Inn and that the 
two later discussed how they would lie to cover it up. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who has pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy, is awaiting sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi testified that in late December, 1988, about the time that Barry 
allegedly was using cocaine with Lewis at the Ramada Inn, the mayor arrived at 
Mohammadi's apartment at 11 p.m. to use the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
He said that the mayor seemed troubled and upset, but he did not explain why. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said he warned Barry later that "you just have to slow down" because 
District of Columbia police were investigating his alleged visits to Lewis' 
hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Mayor told me he is not going to go to any more hotels," Mohammadi said, 
adding that Barry opted instead to use drugs in Mohammadi's apartment, in his 
own home or sometimes on boats docked at a Washington marina. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that in July, 1989, during a crab feast at Barry's house, the 
mayor asked "if I had anything." 
</P>
<P>
"We went upstairs and did some lines of cocaine in the bathroom," he testified. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's downfall occurred last Jan. 18, when he was arrested in a hotel 
room in an FBI sting operation after being videotaped smoking crack cocaine 
with Moore. The resulting 83-minute videotape has been shown at Barry's trial. 
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that he decided to plead guilty to drug conspiracy charges 
earlier this year and to cooperate with prosecutors because "everybody came 
from the woodwork -- I did not have any choice." 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Barry was reported to have sold the rights to his 
life story for a television movie at an unspecified price. The New York Daily 
News said the drama would be produced by former CBS News President Van Gordon 
Sauter, who currently is producing a series with the Rev. Jesse Jackson.

FRIENDS BID FAREWELL TO ACTIVIST SNYDER;

<P>
Cher stood on the flower-filled podium and lauded him for finding beauty in 
people whom others had "written off." Martin Sheen called him a "giant, 
uncompromising and compassionate voice for social justice." 
</P>
<P>
But by and large, Tuesday's farewell to homeless-advocate Mitch Snyder was more 
like a political rally than a solemn funeral service. The tone was appropriate, 
said many of the rich and poor, famous and unknown, who gathered by the 
thousands to remember Snyder, filling a park across from the Federal City 
Shelter that Snyder helped create in downtown Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can separate the politics from the man when it comes to 
Mitch Snyder," said Hilda Nikkel, a Mennonite from Canada who took time off 
from work to "pay tribute to a pretty great man." 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who officiated, praised Snyder but insisted that the 
best eulogy was to continue his work. 
</P>
<P>
"As he ascends to glory," said Jackson, "he leaves us here to tell the story 
that America's dream is incomplete, that the Liberty Bell has a crack in it 
until the homeless are housed and the hungry are fed." 
</P>
<P>
Snyder was found dead in his room at the shelter last Thursday in an apparent 
suicide. A note found with the body indicated that Snyder was despondent over 
problems in his personal life. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Fennelly, his long-time companion and fiancee, said that during several 
of Snyder's hunger strikes he told her what he wanted his funeral to be like. 
"There were specific people that he requested speak at his funeral," she said. 
</P>
<P>
So as mourners wiped eyes damp with sorrow and brows damp with sweat on a hot 
day, a string of the celebrities and supporters he had mentioned stepped up to 
a clutch of microphones arrayed above Snyder's plain pine coffin. 
</P>
<P>
Sheen, who portrayed Snyder in a television movie, said that "it is not 
possible to comprehend Mitch's passing any more than it is possible to 
comprehend the very great and wondrous mystery of his life." 
</P>
<P>
In fulfilling his call to "feed the hungry, clothe the naked, house the 
homeless," Sheen continued, Snyder "confronted the wrath of both church and 
state as well as a troubled nation's conscience." 
</P>
<P>
"Mitch ministered to the unacceptable, and so he himself was sometimes 
considered unacceptable," said Karen Saunders, an official at the women's 
shelter Snyder helped run. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Gregory, the comedian, was one of the few who alluded to Snyder's cause of 
death. "Mitch was a soldier," he said, "and soldiers wear down when they are on 
the front lines. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what was in that darn (suicide) note," he said, turning to 
Fennelly, "but don't let him blame it on you." 
</P>
<P>
Washington Mayor Marion Barry, taking a break from his trial on drug and 
perjury charges, also spoke. Snyder believed, Barry said, that "whether you are 
addicted or not addicted, you are still a human being in God's eyesight." 
</P>
<P>
As the ceremony continued, a sticky drizzle turned into heavy sunshine, forcing 
mourners to use their umbrellas first for shelter, then for shade. 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Berrigan, the radical priest who met Snyder while both were serving 
time in prison, called Snyder a "true shepherd" who fought against "the false 
shepherds of church and state." 
</P>
<P>
One of Snyder's sons, Dean, sat on the podium with others who participated in 
the ceremony. Snyder had separated from his wife and two sons in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
After the service at the shelter, speakers and mourners marched down 
Pennsylvania Avenue behind Snyder's coffin, encased in an elegant horse-drawn 
hearse. 
</P>
<P>
They stopped at the city's main administration building where they demonstrated 
for greater support for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
One of the marchers, Iva Joyce Spencer Vaughn, said that she first met Snyder 
in the 1960s anti-war movement and remembered him having said that "if no one 
followed his casket at the end of his life then he would have failed." ' 
</P>
<P>
'Well," she said, making a broad sweep at the procession with her arm, "you can 
see for yourself."

EX-W. VIRGINIA GOVERNOR SENTENCED TO 5 YEARS, FINED

<P>
Former three-term Gov. Arch A. Moore Jr., convicted of corruption and 
characterized as remorseless by prosecutors, was sentenced Tuesday to five 
years and 10 months in prison and fined $170,000. 
</P>
<P>
Moore, 67, pleaded guilty to charges of mail fraud, extortion, obstruction of 
justice and filing false income taxes during his 1984 and 1988 campaigns and 
during his third term, from 1985-89. He lost the 1988 reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
He was ordered to report to the Federal Correctional Institution near 
Petersburg, Va., by July 31. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Walter Hoffman on Monday had refused to let Moore withdraw 
his guilty pleas. 
</P>
<P>
"No governor or other public official of that responsibility has ever been 
convicted for election fraud of this scope," Assistant U.S. Atty. Joe Savage 
said before sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
"Arch Moore is a criminal," he said. "If there is one thing missing from that 
man, it's remorse." 
</P>
<P>
Moore, a Republican who also was governor from 1969-1977, and a U.S. 
congressman for 12 years, appeared stoic during the sentencing and later 
declined comment. An appeal is pending, said defense attorney William Hundley. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Atty. Michael Carey said Moore likely will serve at least 2 1/2 years 
before being considered for parole. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it sends a very clear message," Carey said. "If you violate the public 
trust, you go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
Carey's investigation into state government corruption also has netted the 
convictions of five legislators, three lobbyists and a state Senate aide. 
</P>
<P>
Moore pleaded guilty May 8 to extorting $573,000 from coal operator H. Paul 
Kizer in return for a $2.1-million refund from the state's Black Lung Fund, 
which provides benefits to coal miners. 
</P>
<P>
Moore also pleaded guilty to trying to block a federal grand jury investigation 
into corruption in his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
And he admitted filing false income tax returns in 1984 and 1985 and defrauding 
the state of his salary and benefits by funneling $100,000 in illegal cash 
payments into his 1984 campaign, to buy votes. 
</P>
<P>
Hoffman sentenced Moore to five years for extortion, six months for mail fraud 
and two years each for the tax fraud charges, all concurrent. 
</P>
<P>
Moore also got 10 months for the obstruction of justice charge, which carries 
that mandatory prison term. 
</P>
<P>
Hundley said Moore's corruption involved campaign funding violations, not raids 
on the treasury, and added: "I submit he served well and honorably."

FOR DELEGATES, THE KEY QUESTION IS 'WHERE DID WE GO WRONG?';

IDEOLOGY: SOME BLAME THE PARTY'S BLUNDERS ON REFORMERS, SOME ON THE LEGACY OF 
STALIN. OTHERS CALL SOCIALISM ITSELF AN 'UNNATURAL FORM OF CIVILIZATION.'

"Where did we go wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
That question has burned throughout the debate at the 28th Soviet Communist 
Party Congress, searing radicals and conservatives alike as they have sought to 
apportion blame for their nation's increasingly desperate decline. 
</P>
<P>
Guilt for the past, far more than hope for the future, has permeated the 
delegates' discussions for the past nine days. The hunt for culprits, 
contemporary and historical, quickly overtook the search for bold new leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Radical reformers suggested that the party put itself on trial and account to 
the people for its misrule over the past seven decades. Conservatives, in a 
counterattack, urged that the leadership be purged of those -- they meant the 
radicals -- responsible for the errors of perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
Top government and party officials standing on the rostrum of the congress to 
answer barbed questions from the delegates have looked more like accused war 
criminals than the men who have brought the country unprecedented 
liberalization in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Even President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has not been spared. The conservative 
criticism of his policies grew so harsh and merciless that he angrily rejected 
much of it as "full of malice" and bitterly told the congress Tuesday, "I am 
alone, and you are thousands." 
</P>
<P>
In its nearly 73 years of power, the Communist Party has indeed blundered, 
badly and frequently, as the party's new platform will acknowledge. Those 
mistakes must be analyzed carefully if they are not to be repeated by a system 
that has failed repeatedly to reform itself. 
</P>
<P>
"The crisis in the party has reached an unprecedented level," Alexei 
Yemelyanov, a prominent liberal from Moscow State University, said as the 
congress began, "but the party leadership has yet to recognize it. The party 
lost the people's trust long ago because of its errors. Society has not been 
reformed since the party in power has not yet reformed itself. 
</P>
<P>
"The party oligarchy -- its leading structures, its principles, the mechanisms 
by which it functions -- has become the main obstacle to perestroika. This 
oligarchy sticks to old-style approaches and combats any form of radicalism. . 
. . The first thing to be done is to apologize to the people for having led the 
country into such a catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
For a country so driven by ideology, to discover where it went wrong is of 
crucial importance -- virtually the key to reversing the nation's systemic 
collapse and resolving its problems, as well as a boost in morale at a time 
when there is a deep crisis of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
On this, delegates to the congress have agreed readily. But they have differed 
sharply on where and why and how communism failed. They have differed on how to 
pose the question and where to look for an answer. And they have differed on 
whether the failures were those of the party, of its leaders or of communism 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Does the answer lie deep in history -- during the dictatorship of Josef Stalin? 
</P>
<P>
If so, that absolves almost everyone now in the party leadership; only that 
handful of party members who still insist that Stalin had "merits" might be 
open to criticism. 
</P>
<P>
But is there not culpability to be found in more recent years -- the "era of 
stagnation" under the late President Leonid I. Brezhnev? 
</P>
<P>
That judgment extends the guilt to virtually everyone now in a leadership 
position, for all were promoted or came of age politically under Brezhnev; 48% 
of the almost 4,700 delegates, in fact, are known as "Brezhnev's children" 
since they joined the party between 1970 and 1985, the height of the "era of 
stagnation." 
</P>
<P>
Or perhaps, as the party's increasingly vocal conservative wing argues, 
perestroika itself was a wrong turn, a break from Communist orthodoxy that 
deepened the country's problems. 
</P>
<P>
"Has the time not come to sum up perestroika, to assess what it has brought us 
and where we stand?" one provincial party leader demanded this week. "Do we 
live better now? Is our economy stronger? Is the political situation more 
stable? Do our people feel more secure? 
</P>
<P>
"In short, how have we gained from this political and economic structuring? I 
find it difficult to see the gains and impossible to measure any of them. Are 
we adding to our mistakes with perestroika?" 
</P>
<P>
Some delegates have gone back further -- to V. I. Lenin, the Bolshevik leader 
who founded the Soviet state, and even to Karl Marx, the father of modern 
communism. 
</P>
<P>
"Marxism itself is flawed, perhaps fatally so," Alexander Tsipko, a leading 
political philosopher, said in an interview, "and if that is true, then how can 
we expect perfection from socialism?" 
</P>
<P>
Tsipko, deputy director of the Institute of Economics of the World Socialist 
System, was one of the first Communist Party intellectuals to question the 
foundations of Marxism. Marxism had misunderstood human nature and human 
motivations, Tsipko argued, and consequently the political and economic systems 
founded on it are based on "a false blueprint." 
</P>
<P>
"When ideas about the goals of socialism are wrong, when they contradict the 
laws of normal civil life, it is pointless to argue about the pace or the 
methods by which they are achieved," he said. "When you have an unrealistic 
goal, it does not matter whether you try to achieve it gradually or through a 
cavalry charge -- the result will be the same." 
</P>
<P>
This was heresy when Tsipko, then on the staff of the party's policy-making 
Central Committee, first raised the question two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Yuri N. Afanasyev, a historian prominent among radical reformers, had 
challenged the system with equal bluntness. Writing in the Communist Party 
newspaper Pravda two years ago, Afanasyev contended that the party had not 
"built socialism," as it had long claimed, nor was the Soviet system even 
"deformed socialism," as party leaders then argued. What the country had 
developed, he said, was its own form of totalitarianism. 
</P>
<P>
"We went wrong at the beginning, at the outset," Tsipko said. "Strictly 
speaking, socialism is impossible in principle, and in practice it has always 
existed in totalitarian structures. . . . We need to return from these 
unnatural forms of civilization, to come back to civilized life." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev himself increasingly reflects this point of view. Although he still 
describes himself as a Marxist, a man committed to "humane and democratic 
socialism," he shows little hesitancy in replacing traditional Marxist views 
with ideas that have long been political heresy here: a morality based on 
"universal human values," a multi-party political system, private property and 
a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
"The ideology of socialism is not a textbook where everything is 
compartmentalized by chapters, paragraphs, rules and principles," Gorbachev 
told the congress Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It will shape up together with socialism itself as we help develop a well-fed, 
civilized, spiritually rich, free and happy country, as we come to embrace 
universal human values again not as something alien from the class point of 
view but as normal for man."

CASUALTY TOLL IN ETHNIC CLASHES IN 2 SOVIET REPUBLICS MAY REACH 800

As many as 800 people may have died in ethnic clashes last month along the 
border between the Soviet Central Asian republics of Uzbekistan and Kirghizia, 
a Soviet newspaper reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Soviet authorities had said 148 people died in fighting near the 
Kirghiz town of Osh on the border between the two republics. 
</P>
<P>
But police Maj. Gen. A. M. Kotlyarov told the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda 
that about 800 people could not be accounted for, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Many were thought to have been wounded in the fighting, then carried by 
relatives into the surrounding mountains. Those who died from their wounds were 
buried without notification to Soviet authorities, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
"The scale of the crimes and their cruelty surpasses those committed in Fergana 
(in Uzbekistan), Azerbaijan and Armenia," said the major, referring to ethnic 
clashes in other republics that have claimed hundreds of lives. 
</P>
<P>
Tension remains high on the border, the government newspaper Izvestia said 
Monday. A state of emergency is in effect in the town of Jalalabad, where a 
20-year-old Uzbek was killed over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The suspected killers are in custody, Izvestia reported, but crowds of angry 
Uzbeks took to the streets demanding that more members of their ethnic group be 
included in law enforcement and KGB bodies, it said.

PRESIDENT CONFOUNDS SKEPTICS WITH HIS DETERMINED PURSUIT OF U.S. TRADE GOALS; 
</P>
<P>
DIPLOMACY: HE HAD PROMISED TO MAKE LIBERALIZATION HIS NO.1 PRIORITY. BUT HIS 
TOUGH STANCE HAS BEEN A SURPRISE.

<P>
When President Bush declared last month that reinvigorating the stalled global 
trade-liberalization talks would be his No. 1 priority at this week's economic 
summit, he drew yawns and snickers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, Presidents have cared only about "big picture" political issues 
such as the environment and aid to the Soviet Union. Few have been willing to 
spend much personal capital on resolving murky trade disputes. Efforts to deal 
with such esoteric matters as trade barriers -- especially on a subject as 
remote from most voters as agriculture -- have gone by the boards. 
</P>
<P>
But this week, Bush is pursuing U.S. trade goals with a determination so 
fervent that it has surprised some of his own senior aides. Not only did he 
lean on West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to back U.S. aims, but he has held 
unusually firm in discussions with other leaders. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the United States may well achieve much of what it wants when the 
seven leaders issue their communique today: an order to negotiators of the 
seven nations and the European Community to seek a compromise that would break 
the current impasse over agricultural trade and get the broader trade talks 
going. 
</P>
<P>
"The negotiators (for the seven summit participants) are likely to be up until 
the wee hours of the morning haggling over language, but there's no doubt we'll 
get something that the U.S. will find acceptable," an Administration negotiator 
said Tuesday afternoon before going back into his predicted all-night session. 
"And it's mainly because Bush hung in there tough." 
</P>
<P>
A staffer who joined the government during the previous Administration noted 
that Bush's determination on the trade issue stands in marked contrast to the 
performance of his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, who barely could work up an 
interest in trade issues. 
</P>
<P>
"Reagan would have 'digressed' by now," the aide said, using the polite 
parlance that some Reaganites used to describe the former President's short 
attention span. The United States would have caved, and the Europeans would 
have won. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for Bush's seriousness is straightforward: The President decided 
months ago that achieving a successful accord in the global trade negotiations, 
including agriculture, was vital to U.S. economic interests. Getting real 
reform on trade barriers is crucial both to safeguard U.S. industry and to 
stave off a new wave of protectionism in Congress, the President feels. 
</P>
<P>
C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, warned 
this week that if the talks don't succeed, the failure will exacerbate 
U.S.-European trade squabbles, prod the major powers to form regional trading 
blocs, slow global economic growth sharply and throw financial markets into 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
Congress, Bergsten predicted, would virtually declare economic war on America's 
trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll not only have a Super 301," he said, referring to a new trade law that 
lawmakers enacted to help punish America's trade enemies. "You'll have a 
Super-Duper 301." 
</P>
<P>
Bush has no illusions about such an outlook. At Washington's behest, the 
24-country Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development last month 
declared the trade talks to be its "No. 1 international economic priority," and 
the summit here is expected to reaffirm that priority. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-European dispute over agricultural trade has been the big sticking 
point in the global trade talks. If the rich countries don't agree to reduce 
their farm subsidies, developing countries are unlikely to support the measures 
that the industrial countries want from the pact -- protection for services and 
so-called intellectual property, including patents and trademarks. 
</P>
<P>
That said, it is little wonder that Bush decided to take a firm stand on the 
agriculture issue here in Houston. The European Community's policy-setting 
bureaucracy, which has been balking at U.S. demands for rapid reduction of farm 
subsidies, is fully represented here. But so are the heads of the individual 
European governments, who are split about the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Bush struck pay dirt early Monday when Kohl announced that he had moved 
virtually all the way to Washington's side on the farm issue, providing the 
first sign of a serious crack in the European front. 
</P>
<P>
He acted partly out of gratitude for America's early support for German 
reunification and partly to avoid the looming burden of extending the costly 
subsidies program to thousands of inefficient East German farmers. 
</P>
<P>
Although Kohl later backed away, under pressure from EC President Jacques 
Delors, the damage had been done, and the EC's solid front already had been 
undermined. On Tuesday morning, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher came 
in with new but still weak language of her own on reducing farm subsidies, but 
Bush rejected that as well, holding out for the Administration's original 
mandate. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, while the final communique almost certainly will contain 
compromise language, and the negotiators undoubtedly would still have to 
bargain through the night, the President seemed likely to get what he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Bush's tough stand on trade won't necessarily guarantee that the 
global trade talks, known as the Uruguay Round, will end successfully. 
Lower-level negotiators from the seven summit nations and 97 other countries 
still must work out their differences in 15 separate categories. 
</P>
<P>
But the firm stand that Bush has taken in Houston is likely to break the 
impasse over the farm issue and get the broader trade talks moving again, 
precisely the sort of "political impetus" that the Administration had hoped the 
summit would provide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SUMMIT HIGHLIGHTS 
</P>
<P>

At least 65 people were killed when security forces opened fire on the crowd at 
a soccer game in Somalia, diplomatic sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The government said only three people were killed when troops fired on people 
stoning the president. 
</P>
<P>
Unofficial fatality estimates from Friday's shootings in Mogadishu range as 
high as 109, according to one source, who said 65 people were confirmed dead at 
the city's Digfer Hospital.

<P>
More than 100 people were seriously injured, another source said. 
</P>
<P>
Abbudllahi Farah Barre, first secretary at the Somali Embassy in Rome, insisted 
that only three people were killed.

MOBS BATTLE KENYA POLICE IN RURAL AREAS; 18 DEAD

Stone-throwing mobs battled Kenyan riot police in rural areas Tuesday, and 
President Daniel Arap Moi blamed the anti-government riots on "hooligans and 
drug addicts." Eighteen people have been killed in four days of violence. 
</P>
<P>
Nairobi, the scene of widespread violence over the weekend, appeared calm. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the State Department said Tuesday that it is advising American 
citizens to defer all non-essential travel to Kenya because of anti-government 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
The wave of violence followed last week's detentions of Kenya's most prominent 
supporters of political pluralism. Five of them have been officially detained 
under public security statutes that allow them to be held without charge 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Kenya, a one-party state, has long been considered one of Africa's most stable 
and successful nations. Since early this year, however, Moi has come under 
increasing pressure to allow a multi-party system. 
</P>
<P>
Clashes between stone-throwing mobs and armed security forces were reported 
Tuesday in and around the towns of Kiambu, Nyeri and Githunguri, all north of 
Nairobi, where riot troops fired on suspected demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
Violence also was reported in Kangemi and Kawangware, two sprawling, low-income 
neighborhoods on Nairobi's western edge. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the residents, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were 
beaten by police, who then robbed them of money and valuables. The situation in 
both neighborhoods appeared to have calmed by evening. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Moi's office said 15 people had been killed and 61 wounded in 
the disturbances, which began Saturday when police used tear gas and guns to 
halt a pro-democracy rally. 
</P>
<P>
At least three of 10 deaths confirmed independently were not included in the 
government breakdown. The government did not name those killed, and it was not 
immediately clear if the other seven deaths confirmed independently were in the 
official figure. 
</P>
<P>
Moi, in comments to Kenyan troops back from U.N. peacekeeping duty in Namibia, 
blamed the riots on "hooligans and drug addicts" and said his government would 
continue hunting down instigators of the violence. 
</P>
<P>
The comments, his first public mention of the violence, followed a government 
order Monday empowering police to use whatever force necessary to quell the 
disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
Moi has vehemently rejected the idea of political pluralism. He says that 
because there are about 40 tribes in Kenya, a multi-party system would result 
in tribal-based parties leading to ethnic divisions and even tribal warfare.

ALBANIA REFUGEES WILL GO TO ITALY

Thousands of Albanians seeking asylum in foreign embassies in Tirana will be 
ferried to Italy under an agreement being worked out between Albania and the 
United Nations, the Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope the operation can begin by the end of the week," a Foreign Ministry 
spokesman said in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke on condition of anonymity. Another source said it could begin as early 
as Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
A representative of U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar was in the 
Albanian capital negotiating the departure procedures on behalf of almost a 
dozen embassies where Albanians have taken refuge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the asylum-seekers would be ferried from Albania's 
Adriatic port of Durres to either Brindisi, about 85 miles away, or Otranto, on 
the Italian coast, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian government is working on contracting commercial vessels to 
transport the Albanians, the official said, adding he expected that several 
trips would have to be made to evacuate them all. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian Red Cross was preparing to provide assistance to refugees arriving 
in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The more than 6,000 asylum-seekers began taking refuge in the embassies June 28 
in a bid to escape Europe's last hard-line Communist regime. Some dodged police 
bullets as they climbed over embassy gates. 
</P>
<P>
The first 51 Albanians allowed to leave Tirana landed in Czechoslovakia on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Italian officials reported Tuesday that six Albanians who fled their country in 
a small boat were picked up in the Adriatic Sea during the night by a West 
German sailboat.

SENATE DEBATE OPENS ON BILL TO REVERSE RIGHTS RULINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Senate began debate Tuesday on a broad civil rights bill that would reverse 
some of last year's Supreme Court rulings and create a new right for women to 
sue employers for sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
Since January, Senate Democrats have jockeyed with the White House in hopes of 
working out a version of the bill that President Bush would endorse. 
</P>
<P>
"It is essential for this Congress to send a clear message to the country that 
retreat on civil rights is unacceptable," Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), the 
chief Senate sponsor, said in opening the debate. 
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), the main opponent, complained that the 
measure "will force employers to proportionally hire . . . by statistics." But 
he conceded that Kennedy has more than enough votes to pass the bill. 
</P>
<P>
Both Republicans and Democrats say they agree that the law should punish 
employers who blatantly discriminate based on race, sex, religion or national 
origin. They continue to disagree over how to handle employers whose policies 
have resulted in few minorities or women being hired or promoted. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in the case of Griggs vs. Duke 
Power that employers may not use a hiring test that tends to exclude minorities 
unless they can prove the standards set by the test represent a "business 
necessity." 
</P>
<P>
But last year, the court reversed that ruling on a 5-4 vote. Now, employers may 
use tests or other criteria which have a discriminatory effect so long as they 
serve "legitimate employment goals." Moreover, to win a job discrimination 
suit, disgruntled employees bear the burden of proving that those tests are 
unfair and unnecessary, the court said in Wards Cove vs. Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
The Kennedy bill would put the burden back on employers to prove that their 
hiring and promotion standards are fair. If, for example, a company uses tests, 
interviews and other criteria to select or promote employees, and if a 
"disparate" percentage of blacks, Latinos or women are excluded, the company 
can be accused of violating federal civil rights law. 
</P>
<P>
If sued, the employer must prove that those standards are "required by business 
necessity" and "bear a substantial and demonstrable relationship to effective 
job performance." 
</P>
<P>
Democrats said that this change would return the law to the way it has been 
since 1971 and would prevent discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
But, in a six-page letter to Kennedy on Tuesday, White House Chief of Staff 
John H. Sununu said that he "continues to fear" that the bill would force 
employers to adopt hiring quotas to head off lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
Though overshadowed by the "quota" fight, the bill would significantly expand 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by allowing victims of discrimination to win 
compensatory and punitive damages from their employers. Under the 1964 law, 
persons who were fired or not hired because of discrimination based on race, 
sex, religion or national origin could get their jobs and receive back pay -- 
but that is all. They could not win damages. 
</P>
<P>
However, under a separate law dating to 1866, blacks and other victims of 
racial discrimination who were denied employment or were fired because of their 
race could sue employers for damages. 
</P>
<P>
Among those left out were women who were victims of sexual harassment on the 
job. Under the current law, a judge could issue an order to stop such 
harassment but the victims could not win damages. The Civil Rights Act of 1990, 
as Kennedy's bill is known, would permit federal courts to award damages to 
women and other victims of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
California is one of seven states that now allow women to win damages in state 
courts for sex discrimination and harassment. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to reversing the Wards Cove ruling, the pending bill would reverse 
several other high court rulings from 1989: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Patterson vs. McLean Credit, the court ruled that a black woman harassed 
on the job because of her race could not sue her employer. The bill would allow 
an employee who was harassed or discriminated against in any aspect of his or 
her job to win damages. Both public and private employers are covered. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Martin vs. Wilks, the court said that whites who are hurt by a consent 
decree that favors blacks or other minorities may reopen the case to challenge 
it. The bill says that a final consent decree "may not be challenged" in a new 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Lorance vs. AT&amp;T, the court ruled that employees hurt by a change in 
seniority rules cannot challenge them after they have been in effect for 180 
days. The bill would drop that deadline and allow legal challenges.

SAN DIEGO BISHOP MAHER'S RESIGNATION ACCEPTED 
</P>

<P>
Pope John Paul II on Tuesday accepted the resignation of ailing Bishop Leo T. 
Maher, who gained nationwide attention when he refused Communion to a political 
candidate because of her views on abortion, as head of the Catholic Diocese of 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, Bishop Robert H. Brom became the fourth leader of the diocese. 
</P>
<P>
It was also announced Tuesday that the Pope has accepted the resignation of the 
nation's highest-ranking black Roman Catholic clergyman, Archbishop Eugene A. 
Marino of Atlanta, for personal reasons and ill health. 
</P>
<P>
Maher, 75, who is suffering from a malignant brain tumor, reached the church's 
mandatory retirement age July 1 and had been waiting for the Pope to accept his 
resignation. Brom, 51, was appointed successor to the job in April, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Maher last year became the first Roman Catholic clergyman to denounce a 
politician for favoring abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
In a two-page letter, he called state Sen. Lucy Killea (D-San Diego), a 
Catholic, "an advocate of this most heinous crime" and told her that the ban 
would remain until she recanted her position. 
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Tuesday morning, reporters asked Brom about Maher's 
Communion ban on Killea, which was imposed after she broadcast commercials 
outlining her abortion-rights stand during her political campaign in November. 
</P>
<P>
Brom did not address directly whether Maher's ban is still in effect. 
</P>
<P>
Killea said she will not defy the San Diego bishop in his own diocese. "I would 
assume the ban would continue unless something is done about it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Killea narrowly defeated Assemblywoman Carol Bentley (R-El Cajon) in a Dec. 5 
special Senate election. Bentley is adamantly an abortion foe. 
</P>
<P>
Maher, bishop for almost 21 years, was ordained a priest in 1943. 
</P>
<P>
Brom was previously bishop of the Diocese of Duluth, Minn. The San Diego 
diocese includes more than 450,000 registered Catholics in San Diego and 
Imperial counties. 
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, a resignation letter released Tuesday by Marino, 56, said he needed 
"an extended period of spiritual renewal, psychological therapy and medical 
supervision." James P. Lyke, auxiliary bishop of Cleveland, will begin serving 
next month as apostolic administrator for the archdiocese. Lyke, 51, also is 
black. 
</P>
<P>
Marino had relinquished his duties last May and had been undergoing treatment 
in New York for physical ailments and psychological stress. 
</P>
<P>
About 12 years ago, Marino was treated for alcoholism and more recently had 
suffered high blood pressure, chest, neck and back pains. 
</P>
<P>

SACRAMENTO FILE: TIME MAY HAVE ARRIVED FOR PUTTING TAXES ON CREDIT CARD

A pilot project to let some Californians pay their state income and bank and 
corporation taxes by credit card would be launched under a bill (AB 3583) sent 
to Gov. George Deukmejian by the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The state Franchise Tax Board would select target control groups for the trial 
program. An evaluation with recommendations would be presented to the 
Legislature by Dec. 31, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Paul Woodruff (R-Yucaipa), cleared the 
Assembly by a 57-2 vote. It previously passed the Senate by a 22-11 margin. 
</P>
<P>
"This bill is offered as a convenience to taxpayers who may not have sufficient 
funds to pay their taxes when due," Woodruff said. "It also would help them to 
avoid late-payment penalties." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the governor said he has no position on the measure at this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
The Internal Revenue Service reportedly also is considering a similar credit 
card payment plan for federal income taxes, which would require an act of 
Congress.

STATE BUDGET: SENATE OKS THE LEVY AS PART OF PACKAGE DESPITE A STRONG LOBBYING 
EFFORT BY PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION.

<P>
A proposed sales tax on newspapers and magazines began moving through the 
Legislature on Tuesday as part of the effort to close the state's $3.6-billion 
budget gap -- despite vigorous lobbying by newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate approved the tax in a package of budget bills on which final action 
was expected late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Citing press freedom, competitiveness and common sense, the California 
Newspaper Publishers Assn.'s Sacramento lobbyist has been busy buttonholing 
legislators, and newspaper executives across the state -- from the 
20,000-circulation Santa Maria Times to the 1.2-million-circulation Los Angeles 
Times -- have been contacting their local lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
The newspapers' efforts haven't knocked the sales tax proposal off the 
negotiating table. Although approved in the Senate, the measure's prospects in 
the Assembly are uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
But Capitol insiders are betting that by the time the budget negotiations are 
completed, lawmakers and the governor will have found some other way to raise 
the $54 million that the periodical taxwould generate. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us are feeling the heat," said Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of 
Fresno, who proposed the tax as part of a $729-million plan to raise taxes and 
fees. The plan also would reimpose the sales tax on the sale or rental of 
motion pictures and recordings and on some movie production expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Maddy said his staff has heard from the Santa Maria paper, which is in his 
district. Senate Leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) got a call and a 
letter from Los Angeles Times President Richard T. Schlosberg III, according to 
Roberti press secretary Robert Forsyth. Forsyth said Roberti intends to support 
the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing is affecting every segment of California," Forsyth said. "Why not 
newspapers?" 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush (R-Saratoga), who watched from close range 
as a similar proposal died without a vote in an Assembly committee last year, 
said the experience reminded him of some old advice that has been attributed to 
various sages: Never pick a fight with someone who buys ink by the barrel. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a feeling that a newspaper could take it out on a legislator and hurt 
him at the ballot box with unfavorable editorials and unflattering articles," 
Quackenbush said. "A newspaper could really tube your career." 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, the opposition has come almost exclusively from business-side 
newspaper executives. Maddy said he had yet to see a paper editorialize against 
the proposal. A columnist for the Sacramento Union did write that the idea 
reminded him of the Stamp Act, Great Britain's pre-Revolutionary War attempt to 
tax newspapers, books, pamphlets and similar products in the American colonies. 
</P>
<P>
The Maddy plan would repeal the sales tax exemption that newspapers have 
enjoyed since 1941, when the Legislature relieved the industry of paying the 
tax that was imposed statewide in 1933. Apparently, few newspapers ever paid 
the levy, and they were able to persuade lawmakers that a tax on "information" 
was a bad idea and would prove difficult to collect. The same arguments are 
being used today. 
</P>
<P>
The publishers argue that the tax could not be collected at news racks without 
tacking an extra nickel onto the price of a paper, which would drive away 
customers, restricting the flow of information to Californians, and perhaps 
lowering revenue and cutting into the amount the paper could spend gathering 
the news. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Dorais, the publishers' Sacramento lobbyist, said the proposal would 
make tax collectors of the children who toss newspapers onto porches throughout 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The boys and girls and, increasingly, the adults who deliver newspapers usually 
serve as independent contractors. They buy papers from the publisher and then 
resell them to subscribers. Under that arrangement, the retail distributors, 
not the publisher, would have to collect the tax from subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not reasonable to expect these kids to be collecting the tax and turning 
that money over to the state," Dorais said. 
</P>
<P>
Schlosberg, who runs the business side of The Times, which in its editorials 
has urged the Legislature to raise revenue without a general tax increase, said 
the newspaper's position on this revenue-raiser is that "the exemption has been 
in place for almost 50 years and it would be inappropriate from a public policy 
point of view as well as a practical point of view to change anything." 
</P>
<P>
Dorais added that these are not particularly good economic times for 
newspapers. He noted that the Los Angeles Herald Examiner closed last year and 
at least two other metropolitan California dailies are having financial 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is, newspapers cannot afford a new tax," Dorais said. "We aren't in a 
position where we can just add 6% to the cost of doing business."

AIDS FUNDS TAKEN FROM RESEARCH, GIVEN TO CLINICS

Creating a debate that pits scientists against AIDS activists, the Legislature 
has diverted funds from the University of California's AIDS research budget to 
help pay for early treatment of those infected with the deadly virus. 
</P>
<P>
UC scientists argue that the $1.8-million cutback could significantly harm AIDS 
research in California. 
</P>
<P>
"If this trend continues, it's going to be devastating for the program," said 
Dr. Nirmal K. Das, director of the university-wide AIDS Research Program. 
"We're going to lose credibility among (medical) investigators. We're not going 
to be able to expand our research or attract a new generation of researchers." 
</P>
<P>
The UC program, the state's main AIDS research vehicle, had a budget last 
fiscal year of $10.5 million, and the same amount was proposed for this year 
before the diversion. Scientists said that since the program's inception in 
1983, it has made such important advances as isolation of the 
human-immunodeficiency virus in 1984, discovery of how HIV replicates itself 
within cells and testing of the anti-HIV drug AZT. 
</P>
<P>
Many AIDS activists, while not disputing the important medical advances made by 
UC researchers, argue that other programs should take precedence in this tight 
budget year. They say the most urgent need is for early treatment and 
counseling of those diagnosed as HIV-positive, for their own sake and to 
prevent the spread of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian has budgeted only $3.5 million for early-intervention 
programs, compared to $40 million proposed by the AIDS Budget Task Force, a 
group of doctors and activists convened annually to advise the Legislature on 
AIDS funding. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on the group's recommendation, Assemblyman John Vasconcellos, chairman 
of the Ways and Means Committee, proposed in late June that the Senate-Assembly 
conference committee on the budget strip $3.6 million from the UC research 
budget. The Santa Clara Democrat scaled back his request to $1.8 million after 
other committee members argued for a smaller cut. 
</P>
<P>
The diversion of AIDS funds is part of the spending program contained in the 
conference committee report and approved Tuesday by the Senate. The measure 
still must be approved by the Senate and Assembly and signed by Gov. 
Deukmejian.

HUGHES, MARTIN MARIETTA SUBMIT THEIR FINAL BIDS FOR FORD'S AEROSPACE UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Hughes Aircraft and Martin Marietta have submitted final bids for the Ford 
Aerospace subsidiary of Ford Motor Co., defense industry sources said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The bid by Los Angeles-based Hughes Aircraft, a unit of General Motors, was 
submitted in conjunction with the French aerospace firm Alcatel, the sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Alcatel reportedly is seeking to acquire Ford's communications satellite 
business in Palo Alto and Hughes the remainder of the Newport Beach-based 
aerospace company. 
</P>
<P>
When Ford put its defense unit on the market in early January, it was expected 
to fetch as much as $1.5 billion, but industry sources say it may go for as 
little as $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
It is another measure of how depressed the defense industry has become, facing 
a future of spreading world peace and dwindling defense budgets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fire-sale time in the defense industry," one knowledgeable source said. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor spokesmen Tom Rhoades declined to comment on what companies made 
bids or how much they were. He acknowledged only that Ford received bids. 
Rhoades said he did not know when a winner will be announced. 
</P>
<P>
Elliot Miller, a spokesman for Bethesda, Md.-based Martin Marietta, said he 
could neither confirm nor deny the report that his company was a bidder. 
Martin, a major producer of spacecraft and electro-optical systems, was the 
nation's eighth-largest defense contractor in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes Aircraft spokesman Richard Dore also had no comment. General Motors 
Corp., which owns Hughes, was the nation's fifth-largest defense contractor 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Aerospace's revenue is estimated at $2 billion annually, two-thirds of it 
from the defense sector. The company employs about 17,000 around the nation. 
Ford Motor was the nation's 28th-largest defense contractor in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Ford Aerospace's satellite business, which Alcatel wants to acquire, produces 
commercial communications satellites, including the most recent generation for 
the international communications agency Intelsat. In addition, the Palo Alto 
unit builds weather satellites for the Commerce Department's National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration. 
</P>
<P>
A number of foreign firms have acquired U.S. defense contractors, with various 
arrangements to protect U.S. defense technology. Since Ford is not a major 
producer of military reconnaissance satellites, perhaps the most sensitive such 
technology, a purchase by a foreign company might not face insurmountable 
obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to satellites, Ford Aerospace produces tactical missiles in Newport 
Beach, conducts support work for the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration in Houston and operates a satellite tracking control center in 
Sunnyvale, Calif. Ford also owns BDM, a defense consulting and engineering 
organization, which was acquired in 1988 for $425 million. 
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said Ford is a major contractor to the super-secret National 
Security Agency, operating telecommunications-intercept posts around the world. 
</P>
<P>
A number of Ford operations would be good fits with Hughes Aircraft operations, 
including Ford's tactical missile and electro-optical targeting businesses. 
Hughes is suffering a business downturn in both its electro-optical and missile 
businesses, and a consolidation with Ford could help both operations, experts 
said. But Hughes' primary interest is in Ford's software capabilities, the 
industry sources said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ford satellite business would also seem to fit well with Hughes Aircraft's 
Space &amp; Communications group, the world's dominant producer of 
communications satellites. But knowledgeable sources suggested that Hughes has 
little enthusiasm for Ford's satellite operations. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' decision to try to acquire Ford came as a surprise to some industry 
officials, who noted that Hughes has been attempting to diversify out of 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes Chairman Malcolm Currie wants to obtain 40% to 50% of Hughes' revenue 
from non-defense operations by the end of this decade.

VERDICT THROWS FRAUD PROBE A CURVE; 
</P>
<P>
COMMODITIES: THE GOVERNMENT MUST DECIDE WHETHER TO INDICT 100 OTHER TRADERS AND 
BROKERS. WHATEVER HAPPENS, REFORMS SEEM INEVITABLE.

<P>
The failure of a jury on Monday to convict three currency traders from the 
Chicago Mercantile Exchange on either racketeering or fraud charges may force 
the government to reassess whether to seek additional indictments in its 
investigation of commodities traders who allegedly bilked customers and skimmed 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 brokers and traders at the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade, 
who have not been charged by federal prosecutors, are under investigation, 
according to attorneys in the case. They may face indictments in the 
government's extensive probe of corruption on the world's largest commodities 
markets, the attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those under investigation work in trading pits where the government has 
not previously sought indictments, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
So far, 47 brokers and traders and one clerk have been indicted. Sixteen have 
admitted their guilt under plea-bargain agreements with the government. 
</P>
<P>
The next trials stemming from the case, scheduled for September, involve 
brokers and traders from the Japanese yen pit at the Merc and the soybean pit 
at the Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of traders on the cusp of being indicted right now, and those 
people have received a tremendous shot in the arm" from the verdict, said an 
attorney representing several traders. 
</P>
<P>
"The government may dismiss this verdict, but it still is going to have a big 
impact on how it proceeds in future cases," the attorney added. "The government 
is not about to undertake weak prosecutions." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the mixed verdicts in the first trial growing out of the FBI's 
two-year undercover investigation is being widely viewed here as a major 
setback for the government. While two traders were found guilty of violating 
federal commodities laws, none of the three was convicted of the more serious 
charges of racketeering and fraud. The jury of nine women and three men failed 
to reach a verdict on many of the charges, so a partial mistrial was declared 
Monday by U.S. District Judge Ann C. Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Although federal prosecutors vowed to seek a retrial, Merc officials maintained 
that the jury's failure to find evidence of a widespread conspiracy vindicated 
the exchange's longstanding assertion that trading abuses uncovered by the FBI 
represented isolated incidents. A Merc spokesman also noted that the 
convictions involved relatively small trades that cost customers only a few 
hundred dollars in lost profits. That raises questions, the spokesman said, 
about whether the multimillion-dollar investigation, involving four undercover 
FBI agents posing as traders, represented a wise investment of government 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
"This verdict is a substantial rejection of the idea that there was widespread 
wrongdoing here at the exchange," the spokesman said. "I think traders do feel 
vindicated. . . . They always felt this was blown out of proportion." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys agreed that the most damaging blow to the government's trial 
strategy came from the jury's refusal to accept the government's premise that 
illegal trades observed by an undercover FBI agent were part of a widespread 
racketeering conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the impact of this verdict will be on other cases, but it 
shows that juries are not going to be quick to accept racketeering as an 
appropriate tool (for the prosecution) in this context," said Alan Blumenthal, 
who represented one of the three currency traders. "This jury basically 
repudiated the idea of a scheme or a conspiracy." 
</P>
<P>
But if the prosecutors have yet to land a big fish in court, the government's 
dramatic use of an undercover sting operation has had a lasting impact on 
traders and the exchanges themselves. Since the investigation was revealed in 
January, 1989, traders have reportedly been far more cautious and circumspect, 
partly out of a fear that government agents or informants are still operating 
on the floors of the exchanges. In fact, traders are apparently so suspicious 
that some have been ostracized after being wrongly accused of being informants, 
lawyers say. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thinks there are snitches down there," one attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a series of reform measures have either been proposed or put in 
place by the two exchanges and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, the 
federal agency that oversees commodities trading. The changes should cut down 
on the ability of traders to cheat customers and skim trading profits. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the reforms are aimed at tightening traders' reporting requirements 
under the frenzied and antiquated "open outcry" system used in Chicago's pits. 
A number of rules changes by the exchanges have already shortened the time 
between when a trade occurs and when it is officially recorded. 
</P>
<P>
At the Merc, for instance, trading cards, which list each transaction, are 
picked up from traders every half hour. Previously, they were collected only 
twice a day. That should make it easier to spot traders' attempts to rewrite 
orders and falsify prices in order to benefit themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest change could come from a proposal by both the Merc and the Board of 
Trade to develop hand-held electronic trading devices. The gadgets would 
automatically -- and immediately -- send each transaction to a central clearing 
center. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Klejna, director of enforcement for the CFTC, said Tuesday that he 
doesn't believe that Monday's verdict will have any effect on the ongoing 
efforts to reform trading practices in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
He added that, given the fact that the government may seek to retry the three 
currency traders, "the Merc's sense of vindication (of its current system) may 
prove to be premature."

S&amp;L REGULATORS MAY SUE NEIL BUSH

Federal regulators are considering filing a lawsuit against President Bush's 
son Neil and other former directors of a failed savings and loan in Denver, 
charging them with negligence in causing substantial losses to the thrift, 
government officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
If a lawsuit is filed, it would seek substantial damages, perhaps in excess of 
$100 million, from Neil Bush and other former directors for the losses 
allegedly caused while they served on the board of Silverado Banking, Savings 
&amp; Loan in Denver, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The possible civil complaint is being discussed at the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp., the agency that is overseeing the financial clean-up of 
hundreds of insolvent thrift institutions across the country. 
</P>
<P>
FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman and the other members of the three-person 
board will make the decision whether to file a suit against Neil Bush and other 
former directors of the defunct Silverado. 
</P>
<P>
"An investigation is under way," said Alan Whitney, a spokesman for Seidman. 
"But no final decision" has been made on filing a lawsuit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Bush could not be reached for comment on the possible lawsuit, but he has 
denied repeatedly that his actions as a Silverado director were improper. He is 
challenging a separate administrative action filed against him by the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was a Silverado director from August, 1985, until August, 1988. Silverado 
was seized by the federal government in December, 1988, and the loss to 
taxpayers may exceed $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado regulators wanted to close Silverado in October, 1988, because the 
institution suffered massive losses on real estate loans that went bad and had 
exhausted its capital. 
</P>
<P>
But Colorado lacked the money to pay off depositors, whose accounts were 
insured by the federal government up to $100,000. Federal authorities had the 
effective last word on Silverado's fate, and regional regulators have said that 
an official in Washington made a phone call ordering them to keep Silverado 
open beyond the date of the presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department's inspector general is conducting an investigation to 
determine who placed the call from Washington, and whether political pressure 
was involved. 
</P>
<P>
The President's 34-year-old son already has been charged by another government 
agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, with violating conflict of interest 
rules. The agency said he failed to disclose to other board members that he was 
involved in business relationships with two Denver developers who were major 
borrowers from Silverado. 
</P>
<P>
The OTS is seeking a cease-and-desist order barring Neil Bush from committing 
future violations of the conflict of interest rules. An administrative law 
judge will hear the case in Denver on Sept. 25. A final ruling will not come 
until well after the November election. 
</P>
<P>
Because Neil Bush's case will not be immediately resolved either for or against 
him, the uncertainty seems likely to cause political problems for the 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
The FDIC frequently sues directors or officers of failed financial 
institutions. But the naming of the President's son as a defendant would be an 
embarrassment for the White House, which is engaged in a political struggle 
with the Democratic Party over who should be blamed for the huge S&amp;L 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said at the economic summit in Houston 
that he had no information about the possible lawsuit.

FIRED SECURITIES ANALYST SUES DONALD TRUMP

Marvin B. Roffman, the securities analyst fired for his remarks about Donald J. 
Trump's new casino, sued the real estate tycoon Tuesday, claiming that Trump 
made defamatory comments about him. 
</P>
<P>
Roffman also filed an action before an arbitration panel of the New York Stock 
Exchange, charging that he had been wrongfully dismissed by the Philadelphia 
brokerage firm, Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., his attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit filed in U.S. District Court seeks more than $2 million from Trump for 
defamation and wrongful interference in Roffman's employment. 
</P>
<P>
He is asking more than $3 million from Janney Montgomery Scott on three counts 
of wrongful dismissal, defamation and infliction of mental distress. 
</P>
<P>
Martin Sobol, Roffman's attorney, said his client believes he was fired from 
his job because "he was honest." 
</P>
<P>
"He feels he was wronged," Sobol said. 
</P>
<P>
Roffman declined to comment. John Barry, a Trump spokesman, declined to comment 
until he had seen the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Roffman, 50, a vice president at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, was 
fired March 23 over his negative critique of Trump's Taj Mahal Casino Resort in 
Atlantic City, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Roffman told the Wall Street Journal in March 20 editions that the casino would 
flourish just after it opened in April, but "once the cold winds blow from 
October to February, it won't make it. The market just isn't there." 
</P>
<P>
According to the lawsuit, Trump sent a letter to Janney Montgomery President 
Norman T. Wilde that said, "For a long while I have thought of Mr. Roffman as 
an unguided missile." 
</P>
<P>
In his suit, Roffman said Trump's letter "contained false and defamatory 
material because . . . Roffman's statements in the Wall Street Journal were not 
outrageous; he is not an unguided missile, unprofessional . . . and a bad 
analyst." 
</P>
<P>
Trump threatened Janney Montgomery with a lawsuit unless Roffman publicly 
retracted the comments or the firm fired the 16-year veteran securities 
analyst. Roffman initially signed a letter of apology, but took it back in a 
second letter and was fired. 
</P>
<P>
Janney Montgomery contended that he was fired because he violated company 
policy by issuing statements to the press that had not been cleared and that 
had not been disseminated to the firm's clients. 
</P>
<P>
Janney Montgomery is a wholly owned subsidiary of Penn Mutual Life Insurance 
Co.

FOREIGN FIRMS MAY BE CHEATS ON U.S. TAXES

American subsidiaries of foreign firms may be underpaying their U.S. income 
taxes by billions of dollars each year, Commissioner of Internal Revenue Fred 
T. Goldberg said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Income statistics and Internal Revenue Service examinations suggest that the 
companies are using false pricing techniques and other practices in 
transactions with parent firms to understate taxes, Goldberg told the House 
Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. J. J. Pickle, (D-Tex.), chairman of the subcommittee, opened hearings into 
whether current law and size of the IRS staff are adequate to prevent cheating. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the companies investigated have been operating in the United States 
for years and have never sent a check to Uncle Sam for one thin dime," Pickle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They have failed to pay taxes despite the fact they have profited from selling 
billions of dollars of cars, motorcycles, stereos, televisions, VCRs, 
microwaves and other products to the American consumer." 
</P>
<P>
A nine-month investigation by the subcommittee's staff of 36 foreign-owned U.S. 
companies found that more than half paid little or no federal income taxes at a 
time when they handled billions of dollars in gross sales. 
</P>
<P>
IRS officials have said U.S. subsidiaries artificially inflate prices they pay 
their foreign parents to show low or no profits in the United States, thereby 
avoiding taxes. The practice is called transfer pricing. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS said foreign companies operating in the United States chalked up $686 
billion in U.S. sales in 1987. The companies' U.S. subsidiaries paid $5.6 
billion in taxes, 0.8% of receipts. U.S.-owned corporations paid slightly more 
than 1% of their receipts. 
</P>
<P>
The companies, which sold automobiles, motorcycles, and electronics equipment, 
cited poor profit performance when paying little or no U.S. taxes, but the IRS 
was not convinced, the subcommittee staff said. 
</P>
<P>
Pickle's investigators found that: 
</P>
<P>
* Over a 10-year period, more than half the foreign companies they investigated 
paid little or no U.S. income tax. 
</P>
<P>
* One electronics distributor paid more than $150 million in taxes over six 
years. A second company, with similar products, assets, receipts and 
distribution networks, paid no tax. Both are U.S. subsidiaries of foreign 
corporations. The difference: transfer pricing. 
</P>
<P>
* For tax purposes, one company sold television sets to an outside distributor 
for $150 but charged its own distributor $250. One foreign car maker charged 
its U.S. distributor $800 more than its Canadian distributor. 
</P>
<P>
* Some foreign-owned subsidiaries have engaged in kickbacks and imposed illegal 
freight and insurance charges to avoid taxes. 
</P>
<P>
* An electronics company grossed $4 billion over seven years but reported tax 
liability of only $15 million. The company paid no taxes for 10 years, the IRS 
said, because it used operating losses to get refunds of what little tax it had 
paid during profitable years. 
</P>
<P>
The IRS said that while Japanese-controlled companies accounted for 27% of the 
receipts of U.S. subsidiaries in 1987, they paid only 21% of the taxes. 
British-controlled subsidiaries had 15% of the sales but paid 31% of the taxes.

MANUFACTURING UNIONS' RANKS FALL 3.2% IN '89

Membership in manufacturing-industry labor unions registered its biggest drop 
in three years in 1989, the Grant Thornton management consulting firm said. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the 3.2% drop: greater demand for high-tech workers. 
</P>
<P>
"There are fewer unions in the high-tech area, and those that are, are not 
organizing as effectively," said Selwin Price, a partner at Grant Thornton. 
High-tech workers "are better educated, higher skilled, and management might 
keep them happier." 
</P>
<P>
The study shows that union membership in manufacturing fell by 153,000 last 
year. That represents a 3.2% drop from 4.8 million members in 1988. It is the 
largest yearly decline since 1986. That year there was a decrease of 199,500 
workers, or 3.8%.

MARKET BEAT: SOLID-EARNING MARSHALL IS REALLY UNDERRATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Is this any way to treat a nice earnings surprise? 
</P>
<P>
El Monte-based Marshall Industries, one of the nation's biggest names in 
electronic parts distribution, announced late Monday that its earnings for the 
quarter ended May 31 would beat expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall said it earned between 70 and 72 cents a share. Wall Street had 
expected 64 cents. 
</P>
<P>
But after trading as high as $29.75 on Tuesday -- up $1.50 from Monday -- 
Marshall's stock fell back to close up just 50 cents, at $28.875. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall's small but loyal following among Wall Street analysts is exasperated. 
"I don't get it," said Richard Billy, analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities in 
New York. "I think the fair value of this stock is more like $40." 
</P>
<P>
Not that Marshall has been a dull stock this year. In fact, the price has 
rocketed from $18.75 at the end of 1989. But Billy and some other Marshall fans 
insist that the stock remains very cheap relative to what the company is 
capable of achieving the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
For investors who are intrigued with high-tech investing, Marshall is an 
interesting way to play the field: It's one of the big middlemen between 
high-tech parts manufacturers and parts users. Computer chip distribution is 
Marshall's main business, but it also deals in a myriad of other products -- 
from connectors to fiber optics to keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
Middlemen such as Marshall have become more important as high-tech 
manufacturers have streamlined their operations. When they need products fast, 
they turn to distributors. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall was a $100-million (revenue) business in 1981. In the year just ended, 
revenue hit $544 million, according to the company's preliminary estimate. 
</P>
<P>
But because of the computer industry's boom-and-bust nature, distributors are 
always vulnerable. Look at Marshall's recent history, for example: Earnings 
plunged from $1.54 a share in 1984 to 39 cents in 1986, as computer demand 
slumped. Then, as business rebounded in the late 1980s, Marshall's earnings 
jumped to $2.31 a share in the fiscal year ended May 31, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Starting last summer, however, another slowdown hit. Until the most recent 
quarter, Marshall had reported lower year-to-year earnings for four straight 
quarters (down an average 15%). 
</P>
<P>
Now, the May 31 quarterly results have broken that streak. Marshall said its 
revenue jumped about 13% in the recent quarter, to $153 million, led by higher 
sales of computer chips and computer subsystems, which include printers and 
keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
So why didn't the stock get a bigger lift Tuesday? For one, investors already 
anticipated some kind of improvement this year, or they wouldn't have bid the 
stock up 54% in the year to date. 
</P>
<P>
But Wall Street also is wary of what's next for the computer business. Thomas 
Whitten, Marshall's chief financial officer, admits that despite the strong 
recent quarter, it's too early to say that computer demand is rebounding 
significantly. And because summer is always a seasonally slow period for 
computer orders, "we'll really know only when (fall) comes," Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, when Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities analyst Mark 
Hassenberg looks at Marshall, he sees a stock with a lot of potential in the 
early 1990s and relatively little risk, barring an outright collapse in 
computer demand. 
</P>
<P>
At $28.875, Marshall sells for just 13 times latest annual earnings per share. 
What the company has going for it: 
</P>
<P>
Marshall has successfully built up many new high-tech parts distribution 
businesses in recent years, offsetting a plunge in prices and profit margins 
for what used to be a key product: DRAMs, or dynamic random access memory 
chips. Those basic computer chips accounted for 25% of Marshall's revenue two 
years ago. Now, DRAMs are 10% of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The latest quarter's success, despite the DRAM slump, "is testimony to the 
breadth and strength of our product offerings," Whitten said. In the '90s, the 
product list will enlarge further, he said, most likely to such services as 
contract manufacturing -- assembling certain parts for clients rather than 
shipping them piecemeal, for example. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall has had a reputation of treating customers right over the years, and 
that's paying off now in market share gains at the expense of smaller 
competitors. For example, Hassenberg says that when when certain computer parts 
were in tight supply in the 1980s, Marshall could have gouged customers -- but 
didn't. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall cultivated Japanese parts suppliers in the 1980s and now is the only 
national distributor of Japanese computer chips -- a key franchise for the 
future, Hassenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
The company's finances are strong. Debt is low as a percentage of equity (37%). 
Last autumn, New York investors Lodestar Group took an 8.6% stake in the firm 
and tried to pressure Marshall to recapitalize. Marshall balked and ended up 
buying back Lodestar's stake at the market price last Dec. 1. The decision 
against debt looks like the smartest move in retrospect, given what's happened 
with many heavily indebted companies since. 
</P>
<P>
Though Pru-Bache's Billy has some gripes about the stock -- he wishes CEO 
Gordon Marshall would let the company pay some kind of quarterly cash dividend, 
for example -- Billy still believes in the firm enough to recommend it as his 
"single best idea" among electronic component stocks. 
</P>
<P>
He believes that Marshall's ability to keep earnings above $2 a share in recent 
years, while suffering through the DRAM slump, suggests that the firm has 
tremendous earnings power in the 1990s. Billy sees earnings rising 31% in the 
current fiscal year, to $2.95 a share. And if the DRAM business booms again 
with a big surge in the computer business later this year or in 1991, DRAM 
profits will be gravy for Marshall, Billy notes. 
</P>
<P>
With just 8.6 million shares outstanding and only a handful of analysts 
covering Marshall, this isn't a stock with a big following. But if Marshall 
keeps surprising Wall Street, the crowd is bound to grow.

LOOKING AHEAD: CONSUMER APPLIANCES MAY SOON GO HIGH TECH

As computer chip technology grows ever smaller, more powerful and less 
expensive, virtually everything that can be computerized will be computerized, 
at least experimentally. 
</P>
<P>
A range of new functions will be built into traditional appliances and systems, 
both in the home and in the office. The key will be user friendliness: making 
the appliances and their new capabilities simple to understand and operate. 
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers worry, however, that in many cases consumers might see these 
high-tech appliances as gadgets rather than as legitimate labor-saving devices. 
Developing appliances and systems with remarkable new capabilities will be no 
problem; the trick is to make sure consumers want and know how to use the 
highly computerized products.

For example, a voice-controlled microwave oven that opens and shuts its doors 
when you command it to is one of a number of user-friendly appliances that 
could be on the market soon in the United States. But manufacturers are trying 
to find out first if the public is ready for such equipment. 
</P>
<P>
At Pennsylvania State University, associate professor of industrial engineering 
Andris Freivalds is conducting response tests to see if consumers will accept 
the voice-activated microwave as well as several other high-tech home 
appliances now being developed by Daewoo Electronics Co. in Seoul. Daewoo is 
also working on a remote-controlled vacuum cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
The microwave oven can be programmed to open and shut its door on voice 
command. When the command for opening the door is spoken, the door pops open 
and a tray slides out; on the command to close, the tray slides back in and the 
door shuts. The microwave also has two electronic display screens on which 
prerecorded recipes can be viewed, together with a picture of the completed 
dish. 
</P>
<P>
The vacuum cleaner has an auxiliary engine that attaches to its underside and 
can be driven by remote control. The vacuum cleaner can be guided forward, 
backward, left and right. 
</P>
<P>
Other high-tech consumer products such as voice-activated telephones and 
cameras are already available. For example, Toshiba is now marketing a 
voice-activated telephone in Japan that will dial a telephone number when the 
caller picks up the receiver and says the name of the person being called. For 
the initial input of a name, the telephone's user says a name three times to 
give the machine a range of voice-spectrum patterns. Then, when the caller 
picks up the receiver and says the name, the telephone can recognize the name 
even though it may sound slightly different from the original version. 
</P>
<P>
Another new product in Japan is Konica's compact camera that takes pictures in 
response to sound. The camera is placed on a tripod, from where it 
automatically points itself toward sounds it picks up and snaps a photo. The 
result may a totally candid photo at a party or a photo taken at the moment a 
baby laughs. 
</P>
<P>
Computerized "add-on" technology will enable existing home systems and 
appliances to be modified so that they can respond to voice commands. 
Mastervoice Inc. of Los Alamitos has developed a product called Butler in a 
Box. The computerized system allows homeowners to control up to 32 systems and 
appliances -- ranging from heating and air conditioning, security systems and 
indoor or outdoor lighting to lawn sprinklers and radios -- by using simple 
voice commands. The "butler" can understand oral commands from four different 
voices and can be programmed to give a voice-synthesized response. 
</P>
<P>
Freivalds' tests at Penn State will gather the responses of both adults and 
students to some of these high-tech products and will send their evaluations 
and suggestions to their manufacturer. He believes that the average consumer 
would find such appliances useful and time-saving. "I think the public is ready 
for them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He also notes that such appliances "would be useful to the elderly or 
physically disabled, allowing them more control over their world."

MCDONNELL SHAKES UP HELICOPTER DIVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas Corp. said Tuesday that it is replacing some top executives 
at its Mesa, Ariz., helicopter subsidiary as part of an effort to reorganize 
and cut losses at poorly performing operations. 
</P>
<P>
The shake-up -- including two resignations and three early-retirements -- 
follows a loss at McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co. in 1989. The corporation has 
not disclosed the size of the loss, but the trade publication Aerospace Daily 
last month put it at $37 million. Much of the red ink was due to cost overruns 
associated with production of the Apache military helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
The vice-president of the Apache division -- Stuart Dodge -- resigned. So did 
James Brown, marketing chief of McDonnell Douglas Helicopter. Three executives 
-- managers of manufacturing and quality-control operations -- took early 
retirement. The positions were filled by other McDonnell Douglas executives, 
some on a temporary basis. 
</P>
<P>
The major personnel changes are the first under Thomas Gunn, a senior McDonnell 
Douglas executive who was appointed president of the helicopter unit May 31. 
</P>
<P>
Gunn on Tuesday released a reorganization plan that establishes a marketing 
division and consolidates some operations under other divisions. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we took a major step in preparing . . . to be competitive in the world 
helicopter and (military supply) marketplaces by reorganizing several elements 
of our management structure," Gunn said. "The company's financial performance 
in the past year makes it clear that we must change the way we do business." 
</P>
<P>
Company spokesman Ken Jensen said that, as part of the reorganization, support 
staff for commercial helicopter manufacturing will be increased. 
</P>
<P>
Gunn said the reorganization will reduce costs, but he provided no details. 
Facing serious technical problems in its military aircraft programs and 
financial difficulties on its commercial jetliner business, McDonnell Douglas 
is looking to cut costs company-wide. Last month it announced that it will trim 
$700 million from its annual operating costs -- a move that could lead to an 
estimated 10,000 layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Such cutbacks would come on top of a plan to lay off 7,000 workers at the Long 
Beach-based Douglas Aircraft unit, which is losing money and facing a cash 
squeeze. St. Louis-based McDonnell also has plants in Torrance, Huntington 
Beach and San Diego. The company is the second-largest aerospace employer in 
Southern California, with an estimated 50,000 workers here out of a total work 
force of 129,000. 
</P>
<P>
Personnel changes and some reorganization at the helicopter unit were expected 
because the subsidiary's previous management team underestimated costs on the 
Apache helicopter, industry analysts said. However, some analysts were 
surprised that the changes took place so soon after Gunn took over. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised at the pace at which Gunn is moving," said Howard Rubel of C. J. 
Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell, a New York investment firm. "He's grabbing the bull 
by the horns and making some hard decisions."

A DESERT DEATH: THE ROAD SHOW COMES TO AN END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE WICK, Steve Wick is a bureau chief with Newsday and spent three years 
researching Bad Company. A member of Newsday's 1984 Pulitzer Prize-winning 
reporting team, he lives on Long Island, N.Y., with his wife and three

<P>
The killing of theater impresario Roy Radin in June, 1983, was originally 
considered just another unsolved homicide case. But investigators soon 
uncovered a complex trail of drugs, corruption and dizzying amounts of cash. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, the country near the town of Gorman is remarkably 
rugged. There are ravines and gullies where the terrain is steep and irregular, 
rising and falling sharply. The soil is alternately rocky and sandy, covered 
with thin grasses, scrub oaks, and desert bushes. 
</P>
<P>
On the morning of June 10, 1983, Glen Fischer was headed toward Gorman in his 
Ford pickup. He was looking for a remote canyon where he could store his 120 
beehives. With temperatures rising into the high 90s, it was important that he 
get his day's work done quickly. At 8:30, he was to meet a park ranger, get 
into her truck and scout out possible sites. 
</P>
<P>
The ranger, a pretty, well-spoken woman named Lynn, arrived and Fischer 
proceeded north on the interstate in her truck. At the Hungry Valley exit, they 
turned off, continuing north on a frontage road, then east into a narrow canyon 
on a poorly maintained dirt road, called, on some older maps, Caswell Canyon 
Road. A quarter-mile east of the frontage road, it abruptly ended. Fischer 
jumped out. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think this is perfect," he said, wiping the sweat off his forehead 
with a handkerchief. He was about 100 yards from the truck when he smelled 
something truly horrible. Something's dead, he thought. 
</P>
<P>
He walked in 15 or 20 feet, toward the far side of the dry wash, and when he 
came around a greasewood bush, he saw a hand sticking up toward the sky, with 
two fingers extended and partially separated, in the manner of a '60s peace 
sign. The flesh was yellow, the color of skin stained by nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
He slowly approached the hand, and as he got closer, he could see it was 
attached to some blue cloth. He could make out legs, or rather the shape of 
legs under more blue cloth, and the other arm and a portion of the top of a 
head, with a shock of brownish hair. He stopped again, staring at the ground in 
front of him. 
</P>
<P>
He inched a bit closer, his eyes focused on what was left of the head. One side 
of the face was mostly gone, leaving a portion of the skull on top and the 
jawline at the bottom. There was nothing in between but stained earth. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Christ, he thought, deliberately averting his eyes. The head had been 
destroyed, blown away. The body seemed to have crash-landed against the bush. 
Suddenly, Fischer pulled back. Overcome by the stench and the grotesque 
condition of the body, he turned quickly and went to find Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
By early afternoon, the box canyon was crawling with Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's deputies. Those who went over to examine the remains did so with 
handkerchiefs across their mouths. 
</P>
<P>
Must have been a struggle, homicide detective Willi Avila thought. Probably 
more than one shooter. Then they blasted him in the head, maybe six or eight 
times, a goddamn free-for-all. The whole side of his face, from the temple to 
the jaw, was sheared off, as if by a buzz saw. Considering the condition of the 
skull, it was certainly possible that a shotgun had been fired at point-blank 
range, sending the body reeling backward into the greasewood bush. 
</P>
<P>
A check by Avila of the Los Angeles Police Department's computer records of 
missing persons cases revealed a month-old case concerning the disappearance of 
a New York theatrical producer named Roy Alexander Radin. The suit found in the 
canyon matched the one Radin had worn on the night he disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
On the evening of May 13, 28 days earlier, Roy Radin had been seen getting into 
a limousine in front of the Regency Hotel in Los Angeles with a beautiful woman 
from Miami named Laney Jacobs. They were going to dinner in Beverly Hills. He 
was never seen alive again. 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1960s, while he was still in his teens, Roy Radin discovered that 
there were places in the American heartland where people would pay to see a 
kangaroo act. He also discovered that people in out-of-the-way towns would pay 
to see singers who had not had hits in two decades and comedians who had long 
fallen out of favor. 
</P>
<P>
Enterprising and imaginative, Radin rounded up singers, jugglers, fire-eaters, 
kangaroo and chimp acts, comedians, magicians and sword swallowers, and booked 
them into Masonic temples, motel banquet halls, and high school auditoriums. 
Admission was cheap, and the lines on opening night were long. 
</P>
<P>
Radin was an instant success, if an unheralded one. In just a few years his 
income was such that he and his wife were able to move into the 72-room mansion 
he called Ocean Castle in the wealthy village of Southampton. 
</P>
<P>
All the while, Radin was developing a new persona -- the rich entrepreneur, the 
self-made man. He donned fedoras and capes at some of the shows, acting the 
role of an impresario, the new P. T. Barnum. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Radin's name began popping up in the New York tabloids' gossip pages. 
Sometimes the papers would print his picture, too -- a smiling fat man in an 
expensive suit, ducking into Studio 54. He was practically a fixture at the 
club, where he would spend the night snorting cocaine in a private room and 
talking about his deals. Radin always had grand schemes. He was going to 
finance a Broadway show, buy a circus in Florida, bring back old-time 
theatrical musicals. An abundance of ideas was his trademark. 
</P>
<P>
Until the weekend of April 11, 1980, however, the name Roy Alexander Radin had 
not made any headlines. The event that launched him into tabloid history began 
innocently enough on Friday afternoon, when a young, beautiful model and 
sometime actress named Melonie Haller walked into Ferrara's, a busy Southampton 
pharmacy. She was with a date, a management consultant from New Jersey named 
Robert McKeage, and they were on their way to Ocean Castle. In a few minutes, 
she bought Topol toothpaste, Nivea skin cream, cologne, hair coloring, tampons 
-- and three dog chains. 
</P>
<P>
The couple were to be Radin's dinner guests. Their visit had been arranged by a 
friend of Haller's who had told her that Radin might be able to help her. Up 
until then, her career had included modeling assignments, including a photo 
spread in Playboy, and several episodes on the television show "Welcome Back, 
Kotter." 
</P>
<P>
That night, McKeage tried to woo Melonie and another woman house guest into bed 
with him. He showed the women his impressive drug collection -- cocaine, 
Quaaludes, amyl nitrite, and mescaline. After midnight, McKeage and Melonie 
dressed up in skimpy leather outfits and Nazi caps and marched into Radin's 
bedroom, where they began whipping each other. Both were wearing dog collars 
and chains. 
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday morning, Melonie went back to Radin's bedroom to show him her 
portfolio, which contained her photo spread in Playboy. Radin did not wish to 
speak with her, however, and at his direction, Melonie was taken downstairs to 
her bedroom, where she began fighting with McKeage. At some later point, 
Melonie again went into Radin's bedroom, and in a wild thrashing about, broke 
the lens on his video camera, which was set up on a tripod and pointed directly 
at his bed. 
</P>
<P>
The house guests spent most of Saturday sleeping. Late that night, as if enough 
had not happened in the house, Mickey DeVinko, a moody and often depressed man, 
swallowed a bottle full of sleeping pills. He was rushed to Southampton 
Hospital, where his stomach was pumped. To his dismay, when Radin returned from 
the hospital at dawn Sunday morning, he found Melonie screaming hysterically 
and running around the house. She was cut and bruised and appeared hopelessly 
disoriented. Radin ordered her out of Ocean Castle. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 8 a.m., one of Radin's employees, Ray Wounters, was summoned to 
take Melonie to the train station. He found her in the foyer, stumbling and 
staggering around and mumbling incoherently. 
</P>
<P>
Wounters went and got McKeage, who, upon seeing Melonie, threw her to the floor 
and kicked her in the ribs, face and chest. Wounters stopped McKeage when he 
threatened to smash Melonie's skull with a porcelain dog. Wounters picked her 
up, put her in the car, and McKeage drove her to the station, where she was 
dumped on a citybound train. 
</P>
<P>
That morning, just before 9 a.m., a railroad conductor found Melonie slumped 
over a seat. She was taken to a hospital, and a Suffolk County police 
detective, Lee Roman, was summoned. He found her in the emergency room, her 
long blond hair pushed straight back out of her face, which was bruised and 
discolored. One eye was partially shut from a swollen eyelid. There was a line 
of blood on her lower lip. 
</P>
<P>
"I was beaten," Melonie mumbled to Roman, her voice quickly dropping off. "They 
dumped me on the train like I was baggage." She began to cry. "They beat me and 
kicked me." 
</P>
<P>
Before noon on Monday, reports that a model who had posed for Playboy had been 
beaten up in Southampton were all over the airwaves, and reporters began 
descending on Ocean Castle. Inside, at his desk, Radin told one of his 
assistants that he could not believe this was happening to him. A publicity 
hound at heart, Radin instructed his staff to record all the radio and 
television news and clip all the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, Roman and his partner, Detective Bob Heller, took another 
statement from Melonie, who now added that she had been raped at Ocean Castle. 
She also mentioned seeing a gun in Radin's bedroom, as well as large amounts of 
cocaine. In the course of describing the sexual attack, Melonie said the video 
camera had been on the entire time, and that she had broken it in the struggle. 
</P>
<P>
Radin learned through a police friend that his house would be raided on Monday 
night. The household staff was ordered to do a complete cleanup. The sheets 
were stripped off his bed and dumped in the washing machine, the carpet was 
vacuumed, drawers were cleaned out, pills flushed down the toilets, and 
ashtrays emptied. Most important, the tape that had been in the video camera 
was erased. Then someone yelled out that there were 50 cops in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
Roman was the first through the door. "We are Suffolk County police officers," 
he called out. "We're here to execute a search warrant." 
</P>
<P>
In Radin's big bedroom, a detective found a pistol in his walk-in closet. 
Heller presented it to Radin and asked him if it was his. Radin said no, adding 
that it belonged to a cop in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
"You're under arrest for illegal possession of a gun," Roman asserted. Radin 
was handcuffed and taken away. 
</P>
<P>
After he was booked, photographed, and released on bail, Radin found himself 
deluged with embarrassing publicity. At first, he tried to laugh it off, saying 
it would work itself out. But he knew it wouldn't. He sank into depression, 
complaining to friends that he did not see how his vaudeville business could 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
He wondered whether people on the West Coast were reading about him. Perhaps it 
was time to think about leaving New York and setting up business in California. 
He had produced records there in the past, as well as managed several actors. 
And he had always wanted to produce movies, seeing it as a natural extension of 
his road show business. 
</P>
<P>
In October, 1982, Laney Jacobs was in Los Angeles to be the West Coast end of 
Milan Bellechasses' multimillion-dollar cocaine-smuggling operation. 
</P>
<P>
She decided to buy a large house in Sherman Oaks. It was set back from the 
street on a quiet cul-de-sac reachable only by twisting roads through the 
hills. There was a garage, which she required for her cars and as a place to 
store large amounts of cocaine and money. It suited her needs perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
It took almost no time to get their business in order. Selling cocaine in Los 
Angeles through a network of distributors was simple. To transport the product 
to Los Angeles, Bellechasses hired a courier named Tally Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
Every six weeks or so, Rogers would drive from Miami to Los Angeles, the trunk 
of his car stuffed with 10 to 12 kilos of cocaine in packages wrapped with duct 
tape. He would pick up the drugs at Bellechasses', where on one trip he saw 
2,200 kilos of cocaine stacked in his basement, floor to ceiling. At the Los 
Angeles end, Rogers was also a money courier. As cash accumulated in the 
storage closet in the back of Laney's garage, he would box it or pack it in 
suitcases and drive it to San Francisco. There, he would hand it over to two 
Latinos, whose job was to deposit it in local banks so that it could be wired 
to bank accounts in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
With her cocaine business operating smoothly, Laney turned her attention to the 
dream she had been talking about for years -- movie making. A friend in Palm 
Beach had referred her to a limousine driver named Gary Keys, an employee of 
Ascot Limousine, which was partially owned by Robert Evans, the former head of 
production at Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
When Keys mentioned to Laney that he could introduce her to Evans, she screamed 
with delight. A few days later, Evans called her, and they arranged to meet. 
Laney was beside herself with excitement. 
</P>
<P>
Evans was a genuine Hollywood legend, a onetime actor who, at the age of 36, 
had become Paramount's head of production. Under his supervision, the studio 
released films such as "Love Story" and "The Godfather," which were box-office 
smashes. He was friends with the biggest names in Hollywood, among them Warren 
Beatty and Jack Nicholson, who was perhaps his closest and most loyal friend. 
He had had brief, if well-chronicled, marriages to Ali MacGraw and later 
Phyllis George. 
</P>
<P>
By the late 1970s, Evans was an independent producer. On his own, he seemed to 
lose his way. In short order, he produced a string of flops, including "Black 
Sunday," "Players," and "Popeye." To make matters worse, he was convicted in 
New York in 1980 on federal charges of possessing five ounces of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
The conviction only served to underscore what had been whispered in Hollywood: 
that Evans had a drug problem. By way of explaining the downward slide of his 
career, people who knew him spoke of his sloppy cocaine use. Some said he was 
an addict. 
</P>
<P>
After his flops and his drug conviction, Evans found that his calls were not 
being returned. It was said that he had not stopped using cocaine. Perhaps the 
worst thing said about Evans was that he was no longer in control of his own 
life; therefore, studio bosses were reluctant to lend him the millions 
necessary to make movies. Evans was now a non-player. He began complaining to 
his closest friends that he was going broke. 
</P>
<P>
Then he met Laney Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
Charming, alluring, and mysterious, Laney told him that she had $5 million of 
her own in Miami, and on top of that she had friends with access to even larger 
amounts of disposable cash, perhaps as much as $50 million. If Evans was 
suspicious of the source of her money, he did not immediately say so. 
</P>
<P>
It now seemed that Laney, after only a few weeks in Los Angeles, had hit the 
jackpot. Here, money was what mattered.

 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Robert Evans went on to work on "The Two Jakes," a sequel to 
the movie, "Chinatown." In a 1989 interview with The Times about his then 
just-concluding deal for his autobiography, "The Kid Stays in the Picture," he 
discussed his battle with drugs and said "I've been clean for two years now, 
and have never felt better in my life."

* THURSDAY: After Playboy centerfold Melonie Haller was assaulted at Roy 
Radin's Southampton, N.Y., beachfront home, Radin moved to the West Coast in 
hopes of starting over. There he met Karen (Laney) Jacobs, an aspiring producer 
who offered to introduce him to a man who could make his dream of a Cotton Club 
musical a reality. Radin regarded Jacobs as the perfect Hollywood playmate, but 
he would soon learn that she was a lot more than fun and games. 
</P>
<P>
* FRIDAY: The prospect of a partnership between Roy Radin and producer Bob 
Evans enraged the woman who introduced them. Laney Jacobs wanted in on the deal 
to produce "The Cotton Club," which she felt she had put together. She also 
accused Radin of having knowledge of a $1-million cocaine theft from her 
garage, where she stored the powder before distribution. Despite the bad blood 
between them and warnings that she was dangerous, Radin agreed to meet with 
Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
* SUNDAY: After Roy Radin's disappearance, film producer Bob Evans, believing 
he was Jacob's next target, traveled to Las Vegas seeking help from two friends 
who he thought were connected to the Mob.

EASY LINES OF SUMMER; 
</P>
<P>
FASHION: THERE'S NO REVOLUTION IN STORE IN MENSWEAR. BUT THE EMPHASIS IS ON 
FABRIC AND COLOR -- ESPECIALLY WHITE.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like the song says: "Summertime and the living is easy." The dressing is, too, 
according to the summer '91 fashions shown here by English, Japanese, Italian, 
Belgian -- and, by the way, French -- menswear designers. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time, Paris show dates were advanced from September to July, 
ahead of the Milan menswear collections. The primary reason for the change was 
so that retailers can order merchandise and receive deliveries earlier. While 
the crowds attending were certainly sparser than at past September shows, all 
the top American retailers were represented. 
</P>
<P>
There was an air of uncertainty about the whole event because this city's top 
draws, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Claude Montana and Thierry Mugler, at first refused 
to participate, claiming their collections weren't ready. Ultimately, all three 
opted for small shows staged for carefully controlled audiences. 
</P>
<P>
No one tried to revolutionize what men will wear next summer. Every designer 
included some baggy walking shorts and tight bike shorts, but the main emphasis 
was on easy sportswear pieces: unconstructed jackets and big, oversized shirts 
buttoned to the neck and worn, tieless and untucked, over pants that are 
pajama-like. Only Montana and Mugler emphasized narrow, pegged trousers. 
</P>
<P>
The excitement came from color (pretty pastels and spices) and fabrics: washed 
silks and cottons that looked like suedes; linens with an iridescent shine or a 
rough, hopsacking texture; cool wools and, for evening, nubby and raw silks. 
</P>
<P>
But the palette that made the most impact was white. The all-white look was 
major in every collection and often used instead of black for eveningwear. 
Ivory, vanilla, cream and mother-of-pearl were just a few of the seemingly 
endless hues of whites designers played with. 
</P>
<P>
"The whites looked great, especially when they weren't too white," said Kal 
Ruttenstein, senior vice president of Bloomingdale's, who was attending the 
menswear shows for the first time in eight years. "We didn't have enough whites 
in stock this spring and could sense that customers wanted them. By next 
spring, white will be big." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the best of those white nights included Nino Cerruti's cream-colored 
fringed cashmere poncho worn with a white T-shirt and white shorts, and 
cream-colored linen espadrilles and straw planter's hat. At Christian Dior, it 
was designer Dominique Morlotti's creamy cool wool suits with Mao-collared 
hand-embroidered cream silk shirts. Colors, both pastel and bright, have been 
on the Paris runways for several seasons and until now have looked, well, 
off-color. The new use of color shown at these collections should appeal to 
even the most conservative male. Picture, for example, a lavender sports coat 
paired with gray flannels and a classical striped shirt for an updated -- yet 
somewhat conservative -- outfit. 
</P>
<P>
Shirts were used to add color and pattern with widely spaced, wide horizontal 
stripes looking fresh and exciting, especially as done in huge, oversized linen 
silhouettes by Issey Miyake. 
</P>
<P>
Romeo Gigli was among the few designers holding to a stronger, richer palette 
for summer '91. Typical of his approach was an eggplant-colored gabardine 
jacket worn over a purple shirt and chocolate brown trousers. This was the 
first season for Gigli, based in Milan, to show his menswear in Paris at his 
Rue de Sevigne boutique. He started presenting his women's collections in Paris 
instead of Milan several seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
Like clothes in pastel colors, men's vests have been part of designer 
collections for several seasons, but they rarely made it off the runways and 
into a wardrobe. Next summer, they're an essential, whether a man chooses one 
of Paul Smith's knits or the embroidered vests at Dior or Gigli's patchwork 
creations. Vests turned up in Jean Paul Gaultier's collection -- always with a 
contrast front and back -- on bare chests and under pinstriped suits. 
</P>
<P>
Sonia Rykiel is a newcomer to the French menswear scene this season. Her 
collection is an easy adaptation of the striped knits and oversized tunic 
"message" sweaters that are the essence of her women's designs. The messages on 
her first menswear knits: "artist" or "sweet homme." Almost every outfit 
started with a cotton jersey hooded T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Norma and Herb Fink, who own the Rykiel boutique in Beverly Hills, interrupted 
a holiday in Positano, Italy, to be at the designer's show. "Nicely different," 
was how Fink described the Rykiel menswear. A look that is appropriate for Los 
Angeles, seen at Rykiel and at Cerruti, is the sports coat or blazer tossed 
over a velour or sweat jogging outfit. 
</P>
<P>
As part of a new, uncluttered look, designers showed fewer accessories than in 
the past. Hats were at a minimum, and there were no distractions such as 
attache cases or umbrellas. Shoes, too, were simple -- mainly lace-ups in suede 
or, for more casual looks, sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
The one item that will add an instant snap to any man's wardrobe is a 
knee-length unlined car or trench coat, preferably in washed silk or cotton, 
particularly in pastel.

KOST-FM'S SOFT SOUND STAYS ON TOP IN ARBITRON SURVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The "soft hits" format is still king of the Los Angeles radio hill. 
</P>
<P>
KOST-FM(103.5) triumphed again over the Top 40 format of KIIS and the dance 
music of KPWR to retain its No. 1 spot as the area's favorite radio station, 
the Arbitron ratings revealed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the top-rated stations in the survey, which covers the 12-week period 
from March 29 to June 20, remained unchanged from last quarter's rating. Top 40 
station KIIS-FM/AM (102.7) stayed at No. 2, KPWR-FM (105.5) remained at No. 3 
and talk-radio station KABC-AM (790) kept the No. 4 position. 
</P>
<P>
However, KXEZ-FM (98.7), an "easy-listening" station that changed its call 
letters from KJOI-FM last February, staged a dramatic surge and climbed to No. 
6 from No. 16. And KKBT-FM (92.3), which was converted from a classical format 
to rock last year, then changed to an urban contemporary format this year, 
soared from No. 25 to No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
KXEZ operations manager Allan Hotlen said he was pleased with the station's 
jump. "It's the result of a lot of strategizing and research," he said. "We say 
we play easy music back-to-back without all the talk, and our rating is a 
confirmation that we are filling a need in the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
But Hotlen said that the station would not be breaking out the champagne just 
yet. "It's too soon to celebrate. We've got a long way to go." 
</P>
<P>
KKBT-FM general manager Jim De Castro did feel like celebrating his station's 
increased popularity, however. "This is the result of a lot of hard work by 
some very talented people," he said. "We're only three months into it, but the 
direction is what we want. I'm real excited for the future." 
</P>
<P>
KPWR promotions director Duncan Payton said that he was not discouraged by his 
station's inability to take back the top spot from KOST. KPWR had been No. 1 
almost exclusively for the two years prior to last winter's ratings. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still the No. 1 station with our core demographics, which is between 18- 
and 34-year-olds," said Payton. "The battle for No. 1 is a tight one, as we've 
all seen." 
</P>
<P>
For the second time, KLOS-FM's (95.5) Mark Thompson and Brian Phelps garnered 
the largest audience share in the highly competitive morning drive-time slot, 
followed by Rick Dees on KIIS-FM/AM and Ken Minyard and Bob Arthur on KABC-AM. 
Dees was No.1 last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Following are the top 15 stations and their ratings for the recent spring 
quarter and the preceding winter quarter, as measured by Arbitron.

NORWEGIAN FILMMAKERS FIND THE PATH LEADS TO DISNEY; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIES: AFTER THE ARCTIC VASTNESS OF 'PATHFINDER,' NILS GAUP AND JOHN M. 
JACOBSEN ARE IN GLENDALE FINISHING UP A 19TH-CENTURY PIRATE ADVENTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
"Pathfinder," which is playing at the Fine Arts in Beverly Hills, is a starkly 
beautiful retelling of a 1,000-year-old Lapp coming-of-age saga set above the 
Arctic Circle. The film won a 1988 Oscar nomination for writer-director Nils 
Gaup and producer John M. Jacobsen and now it has brought the pair from Oslo to 
California, where they are completing Gaup's second film for Walt Disney 
Studios. 
</P>
<P>
"Haaken Haakenson," which is the new film's Norwegian title (an alternative 
title is yet to be chosen), is a 19th-Century tale about the adventures of a 
shipwrecked boy, pirates and buried treasure, and it has provided some 
far-flung adventures for the cast and crew as well. 
</P>
<P>
The film, which is being done in English and Norwegian versions, is finishing 
up in an industrial section of Glendale after stops in Fiji, Norway, Spain and 
Britain. This is large-scale filmmaking, with simulated shipwrecks (shot in 
Spain) and sets built to simulate 1852 London (shot in Liverpool). But what 
Gaup is most interested in on this early summer day is providing some 
historical perspective on his own people. 
</P>
<P>
"I should explain that we Lapps call ourselves the Sami people," said the 
35-year-old Gaup. "Lapp is slightly degrading. Our land includes parts of 
Sweden, Finland, Norway and the U.S.S.R. We were a nomadic people who didn't 
believe in borders. We moved from country to country, but we couldn't go back 
and forth between Norway and the U.S.S.R. until perestroika. 
</P>
<P>
"We are one tribe with one language (but several dialects), one religion and 
the same culture. Basically, we are a hunting people. Our religion is similar 
to the American Indians': We believe that the Mother Earth is alive. To kill 
her is the same as killing a person. 
</P>
<P>
"We are struggling to preserve our own culture from being assimilated by the 
stronger Swedish, Norwegian and Finnish cultures. We have also been repressed 
by these people. In 1980, there was a really big cultural fight. The Sami 
people protested the damming of a river -- it was in a reindeer area and the 
river had salmon. But 600 policemen were sent up from Oslo, so we lost. I was 
arrested." 
</P>
<P>
"The technocrats always win," Jacobsen interjected. 
</P>
<P>
Gaup said it was this loss and ensuing depression that partly inspired him to 
write "Pathfinder." 
</P>
<P>
"I was 9 or 10 when we got television," he said, "and TV took over the 
storyteller's place in our culture, which has an oral tradition. I wanted to 
make a big-scope film as a revenge on television." 
</P>
<P>
It was at this point that Gaup, a former actor, and Jacobsen crossed paths: "I 
was making a film, and the cameraman asked me, 'Are you interested in another 
project? There's this Sami actor I know trying to raise money to make a film in 
the Sami language. I think it would be a very good film.' " 
</P>
<P>
"My reaction was a big yawn," Jacobsen said. "I said, 'A Sami movie? You've got 
to be kidding!' My reaction was like that of other Norwegians toward the Sami 
people, who are looked down upon slightly, who are regarded with a kind of 
indirect discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
"The cameraman said, 'Read it tonight or you won't read it at all,' " Jacobsen 
continued. "I was completely hooked by Page 3. Nils really could tell a story 
in images. As for doing the film in the Sami language, I believe that the 
biggest risk is to do the safest thing. People who sit down and say 'We're 
going to do something really commercial' always end up making crap!" 
</P>
<P>
Jacobsen was coming off of a very successful film called "Hard Asphalt" and 
said he was in a position to take a chance. With a budget of $3 million -- 
three times the cost of an average Norwegian film -- and Gaup's plan to shoot 
in Sami, "Pathfinder" certainly was that. 
</P>

"Nobody took us seriously," Jacobsen recalled. "They said, 'This must be a 
joke.' Nobody believed it would play south of this particular area where the 
Sami people live. But I thought we should make it an event. We would present it 
in 70-millimeter -- a first for a Scandinavian film. Now no Norwegian can speak 
Sami, so it would be like seeing a film in Hungarian." 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, quality will out, and "Pathfinder" went on to become the most 
popular picture in Norwegian history and then got the kind of break little 
films need. Jacobsen said a representative from Carolco Pictures, the same 
company that made its international fortune in "Rambo" movies, spotted a poster 
for "Pathfinder" while on business in Oslo and, even though the film wasn't 
finished, made a deal to distribute it internationally. 
</P>
<P>
In London, the film received rave reviews ("The kind you can frame," said 
Jacobsen) and played for six months. Audiences were fascinated by the cultural 
detail about a group of people mostly unknown even to the Norwegians, who 
partially smothered them. 
</P>
<P>
"As a Norwegian, I've learned things about the Sami people I never knew," 
Jacobsen said. "I didn't know . . . that until the early 20th Century the Sami 
people weren't allowed to own land unless they converted to Protestantism and 
changed their Sami name to a good Norwegian one. And it wasn't until the late 
'50s or early '60s that the Sami people were allowed to speak their own 
language in school. It's not that Norwegians are bad people -- they thought 
they were helping the Samis for their own good." 
</P>
<P>
"How often do you see a Norwegian film?" asked Gaup. "Swedish, yes, but hardly 
ever do you see a Norwegian film in America. We were the first film from Norway 
to get an Oscar nomination in about 30 years. It was a great victory for Sami 
culture." 
</P>
<P>
"Haaken Haakenson" is even more ambitious than "Pathfinder," and couldn't have 
been made with Norwegian money alone. So Gaup and Jacobsen again found a white 
knight in Carolco. The company showed "Pathfinder" to agents and studio people 
in Hollywood and helped them circulate Gaup's new script. Among the interested 
customers: Disney. 
</P>
<P>
"Since it was a family-oriented adventure, to us Disney was the logical 
choice," Jacobsen said. "It was a Friday and they said, 'Let's talk on Monday.' 
So here we are." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Gaup nor Jacobsen knows what he will do next or whether they will 
continue to work together. "But I would like to make another film in the Sami 
language," said Gaup firmly.

LEARNING HOW TO SERVE IBSEN'S 'WILD DUCK'; 
</P>
<P>
SEMINAR: A RAP SESSION ON THE COMIC TRAGEDY INCLUDES A RECAP ON HOW THE PLAY 
OFFENDED 1880 AUDIENCES. 
</P>

As Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen was finishing the first draft of "The Wild 
Duck," he wrote a friend that it "doesn't touch on political or social 
problems, or indeed any matters of public import. It takes place entirely 
within the confines of family life. I dare say it will arouse some discussion; 
but it can't offend anyone." 
</P>
<P>
At a pre-preview seminar at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, titled "Lies of the 
Mind: Truth and Illusion in 'The Wild Duck,' " it did cause a good bit of 
discussion, including recaps of how it offended the audiences of the 1880s. 
LATC's production of the comic tragedy opens Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
On hand for the Saturday discussion were "The Wild Duck's" director, Stein 
Winge, and this version's translators, Gerry Bamman and Irene B. Berman, along 
with City University of New York Theatre Program chairman Marvin A. Carlson and 
moderator Richard Toscan, dean of the School of Theatre at USC. 
</P>
<P>
The big question was how to get Ibsen right. This was the play that signaled 
Ibsen's abandonment of social criticism, and he was saying new things in a new 
way. 
</P>
<P>
Bamman, also an actor and director, first noticed a problem with Ibsen 
translations when asked about 10 years ago to find a good translation of "A 
Doll's House." There wasn't one. Since establishing a working relationship with 
the Norwegian-born Berman, they have translated "A Doll House" (the correct 
title), "Hedda Gabler" and "Peer Gynt," among other plays. 
</P>
<P>
Bamman, commenting that any translation "has a limited life" and should be 
redone about every 20 years, was adamant about keeping the work colloquial. He 
pointed to a phrase directly translated from "Doll House" as "fresh as a fish." 
This would mean nothing to an English-speaking audience, he said. "Healthy as a 
horse" was the solution. 
</P>
<P>
Quoting the translator's problem, "you can't be beautiful and faithful at the 
same time," Bamman said that he believes you can -- "if you keep the style in 
mind and retain your humility." 
</P>
<P>
"You should not hear that it is a translation," Berman added, also elaborating 
on the problems involved with the Norwegian language's vocabulary, which is 
one-third that of English, and the difficulties with what she calls "filler 
words," such as yes, well, etc. When Ibsen repeats a word for effect or 
meaning, adjustments have to be made. 
</P>
<P>
Director Winge, who was appointed in January as artistic director of the 
National Theatre of Norway, said that he is really just "getting into" Ibsen. 
This is the first time he has directed "The Wild Duck," and he has been working 
not only with the Bamman-Berman translation, but also with the original 
Norwegian text in his hand. Asked by an audience member how he can work with 
both texts, he replied: "I've been able to communicate with myself the whole 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Winge believes "The Wild Duck" is Ibsen's most cruel play, meaning his most 
deeply cutting, because of the subject matter of a family that lives surrounded 
by their own lies and illusions, finally resulting in the tragic suicide of the 
family's daughter, Hedvig. It's a subject Ibsen bequeathed to future 
playwrights, particularly Eugene O'Neill in "The Iceman Cometh." 
</P>
<P>
Relling, a character in the play, says, "Rob the average man of his basic lie 
and you rob him of his happiness as well." It is restating this truth in the 
life of Ibsen's characters that creates the hurdles that translators and 
directors have to jump without stumbling. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a difficult and personal play," Winge said. "Ibsen couldn't write about 
how he felt in letters, so he put it all in 'The Wild Duck.' " 
</P>
<P>
Carlson added that "it took people a long time to digest 'The Wild Duck,' " and 
the Ibsen plays that followed. He had broken with a long dramatic tradition, 
and "Wild Duck" seemed a parody of an Ibsen play. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to stop lying to each other," Carlson said the characters in "Wild 
Duck" are saying, and it's hard to allow the "wonderful richness and ambiguity 
of the characters to open up into the richness and ambiguity of the play 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
It's that richness and ambiguity that make the translators' job so difficult, 
the director's job so hazardous, the scholar's so endless. Hunting for the 
right connotation, the right nuance that will help to explain why Ibsen's 
characters hide behind their mendacity and illusions, is as intriguing as 
trying to discover why they, like the wild duck when wounded, dive for the 
bottom to escape predators.

SOME HITS BUT MORE MISSES IN ESPN'S BASEBALL LINEUP; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: THE CABLE NETWORK LOSES MONEY IN FIRST YEAR OF CONTRACT, THOUGH 
FULFILLING SUMMER NEED FOR HIGH-PROFILE, LIVE PROGRAMMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
As ESPN is scheduled to begin the second half of its inaugural season of Major 
League Baseball telecasts today, it admits to a pair of rookie errors -- 
overestimating the games' projected ratings and making poor choices for the 
Sunday night games. 
</P>
<P>
For the first 84 telecasts, ESPN has averaged a 2 rating, reaching 1,122,000 
homes. Advertisers reportedly had been promised a 3.8 rating. 
</P>
<P>
The ratings shortfall has caused ESPN to give advertisers additional free 
commercial time, called make-goods, in order to reach the audience that had 
been promised. The amount of the make-goods has been estimated as high as $25 
million. 
</P>
<P>
"The ratings are not performing to the level we had hoped," said Loren 
Matthews, ESPN's senior vice president for programming. "However, they appear 
to be heading in the right direction. We expect the ratings to improve markedly 
in the second half of the season now that there are truly defined races in 
three of the four divisions and we face less significant sports competition." 
</P>
<P>
For Sunday night games, ESPN promised advertisers a 5 rating. Instead, the 
Sunday games are averaging a 3 rating, or about 1.7 million households. On 
Wednesdays, the projection was a 4 rating, with the actual rating coming in at 
2.4, or 1,346,000 households. 
</P>
<P>
For ESPN's Tuesday and Friday doubleheaders, a 2.5 rating was hoped for. 
Instead, the Tuesday doubleheaders have drawn a 1.5 rating, or 842,000 homes. 
Friday's first game is averaging a 1.5 rating and the second game a 1.7. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN paid Major League Baseball $400 million for the rights to televise 
baseball over the next four years. The network planned on losing money on the 
deal, which it has. Officials declined to release figures but a spokesman 
termed the losses "still in the manageable stage." He added that the network 
would approach a break-even point by the final year of the contract, and hoped 
to achieve profitability on a subsequent contract. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for adding baseball was the need for high-profile, live 
programming during the summer. ESPN was strong during the fall with NFL and 
college football and in the winter with college basketball. But in the summer 
months, ESPN filled its schedule mainly with taped sports programming, 
augmented by live auto racing, golf and tennis -- sports that have a core of 
fans, but rarely draw large audiences. 
</P>
<P>
Although the ratings have not reached the level promised to advertisers, ESPN 
says it is pleased with baseball nonetheless. The network's ratings are up 67% 
compared to the same time periods a year ago. Baseball has also boosted the 
number of households that get ESPN by nearly 6 million from a year ago, to 
approximately 57 million, 62% of the national total, maintaining its status as 
cable's largest network. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Tuesday and Friday doubleheaders and the single games on Wednesdays, 
which are selected seven days in advance, ESPN chose its Sunday night games 
last November. 
</P>
<P>
"I picked them off last year's form, but I should have gone a little more on 
gut instinct than on the previous year's performance," said Matthews, an 
executive with the New York Mets from 1970 to 1979. "Next season, I might take 
a few more risks on the Sunday schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews is already voicing concern over two of the final three Sunday 
telecasts. The Sept. 2 game matches the Chicago Cubs and the St. Louis 
Cardinals, currently the bottom two teams in the National League East. On Sept. 
16, the Toronto Blue Jays face the Baltimore Orioles. Last season, these teams 
met for the American League East title on the final weekend of the season; but 
the Orioles have plummeted to fifth this year, nine games behind the Boston Red 
Sox. 
</P>
<P>
"I was trying to catch lightning in a bottle two years in a row," Matthews 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his admitted mistakes with the Sunday night telecasts, Matthews has 
made some choices for the weekday telecasts that have proven fortuitous. For 
June 29, he selected the no-hitters pitched by Oakland's Dave Stewart and the 
Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela. Although most fans couldn't see both no-hitters 
in their entirety because the Oakland contest was an alternate telecast, ESPN 
did broadcast the final inning of each game over its full network. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews believes that ESPN's ratings problems have been caused in part by the 
unexpected poor performances of several teams with heavy national followings, 
including the defending National League East champion Cubs, the Cardinals and 
the New York Yankees. In addition, several key free-agent signings by the 
California Angels and the Kansas City Royals raised off-season expectations of 
a three-team race in the American League West, but both have had disappointing 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, the Chicago White Sox, who have been baseball's biggest surprise by 
staying within a game of the defending World Champion Oakland A's in the 
American League West, have yet to be a boon to the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
"When a team comes out of the blue, it takes longer for people to believe that 
it is for real," Matthews said. "You don't see the positive impact like for 
someone with a more proven record." 
</P>
<P>
Various clauses in ESPN's contract with Major League Baseball have also 
contributed to its ratings woes. The contract generally prohibits ESPN from 
telecasting games back to the home markets of the teams involved in the primary 
games. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN is also forced to compete with as many as four other broadcast outlets for 
baseball fans. On Tuesdays and Fridays, when ESPN airs doubleheaders, there are 
often baseball telecasts on cable stations such as TBS, WGN and WWOR, and on 
local stations and regional cable networks. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN does face less competition on Wednesdays and Sundays. No over-the-air 
stations may air games opposite ESPN on Wednesdays, although regional cable is 
permitted. Telecasts involving other teams are permitted on Sundays, but 
because few games are played Sunday evenings, ESPN has little competition on 
that night.

MEDICINE: CHARGES CITE FIVE 1987 BIRTHS ATTENDED BY THE DOCTOR CRITICIZED IN A 
1990 NEW YEAR'S INCIDENT.

<P>
Dr. Charles W. Turner Jr., the Anaheim physician who timed a birth so he could 
deliver Orange County's first baby of 1990 and display her on an evangelical 
television show, has been accused of gross negligence and malpractice in five 
1987 obstetrical cases. 
</P>
<P>
Jana L. Tuton, a deputy state attorney general who filed the charges on behalf 
of the Medical Board of California, said Tuesday that she is seeking to revoke 
or suspend Turner's medical license. 
</P>
<P>
Although no mother or baby cited in the June 27 complaint appears to have 
suffered lasting harm, "the board feels many of the procedures (Turner) used 
created an unnecessary risk to both," Tuton said. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the board alleges that Turner failed to screen a high-risk 
mother for diabetes and did not diagnose a "breech" -- or buttocks-first -- 
presentation of the baby until after the mother had been in labor for about 10 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
All the cases in question involve care provided at Santa Ana Hospital Medical 
Center. Tuton said investigation began when Turner was suspended from 
obstetrical practice at the hospital in 1988. Turner has continued to practice 
medicine at the Lestonnac Clinic in Orange and at his own Covenant Birthing 
Center in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Reached between appointments at the Lestonnac community clinic, Turner, a 
general practitioner, said he was unaware of the charges and declined comment 
on them. 
</P>
<P>
Turner drew criticism from Orange County physicians last January after he used 
"saddle block" anesthesia and forceps at his Anaheim birthing center to deliver 
a baby seconds into the new year. He then tucked the healthy, 6-pound, 12-ounce 
girl into a Christmas stocking and whisked her to nearby Melodyland Christian 
Center where she was displayed on a national religious telecast. 
</P>
<P>
Tuton said the New Year's incident is still being investigated by medical board 
experts and is not part of the current complaint. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Turner vehemently defended his actions, saying that "the baby was 
delivered safely. And I see nothing wrong with taking the baby and showing it 
to the 4,000" people gathered at nearby Melodyland's midnight service. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate interview in late January, Turner said he was then delivering 
babies safely at his private birthing center at the rate of about 30 a month. 
</P>
<P>
In the medical board's June 27 accusations, Tuton cites five 1987 cases that 
allegedly involved "unprofessional conduct," gross negligence and incompetence. 
As is common in board actions, the accusation protects patient confidentiality, 
using the initials rather than the names of maternity patients under Turner's 
cared. 
</P>
<P>
If Turner contests the charges, the case will be heard by an administrative law 
judge or a medical board review committee. 
</P>
<P>
Among the allegations: 
</P>
<P>
* A woman called O.S. had her labor induced by the drug pitocin "without 
medical indication." Also, the board said, Turner failed to diagnose a breech 
presentation until O.S. had been in labor for about 10 hours. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Tuton said the "standard of care is that you can diagnose (a 
breech delivery) long before that. . . . Those are very high-risk deliveries. 
It's important to diagnose very early on." 
</P>
<P>
* Turner, on Feb. 25, 1987, provided prenatal and obstetrical care to patient 
G.S. but "failed to diagnose" growth retardation in the developing baby before 
labor began. The baby, born that March 5, weighed only 4 pounds, 3 ounces. 
Tuton contended that it was "a high-risk situation that was not properly 
attended to" by Turner. 
</P>
<P>
* Turner failed to screen a high-risk, 31-year-old patient identified as M.A. 
for diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
* Also in the case of M.A. and another woman, E.H., Turner "artificially 
ruptured" their amniotic membranes before the babies' heads entered the birth 
canal, creating "unnecessary risk" for the babies. After rupturing of the 
membranes, the umbilical cord could have fallen down the birth canal ahead of 
the baby, and if that had happened the cord might not have been able to supply 
oxygen and the baby could have died, Tuton said. 
</P>
<P>
* In the case of patient R.P., Turner allegedly violated standards of 
obstetrical care by failing to notify hospital surgeons or pediatric support 
that she was having twins and might need emergency care. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the board's complaint, Dr. Thomas J. Garite, chief of 
obstetrics at UCI Medical Center, noted that he had not seen the medical 
records and could not address the specifics. However, he said many of the 
allegedly negligent actions cited by the board appeared to involve judgment 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
He noted, for instance, that a diagnosis of a baby's breech position generally 
should be made when the woman in labor is admitted "but there can be 
extenuating circumstances." Also, sometimes actions like artificially rupturing 
a woman's membranes are appropriate -- even when the baby's head is not engaged 
in the birth canal, Garite said, adding, "I've done that many times." 
</P>
<P>
According to the medical board, Turner graduated from the University of 
Arkansas medical school in 1950 and was licensed to practice in California in 
1953. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the complaint Tuesday, Turner suggested that the charges may 
involve another physician with the same name. 
</P>
<P>
But Tuton said she is confident they have the right doctor. She noted that the 
board's records on alleged negligence at Santa Ana Hospital Medical Center show 
that doctor had the same medical license number as the Dr. Turner who raced to 
deliver the first baby of 1990 at his Anaheim birthing center. 
</P>
<P>
Turner was reached at the Lestonnac Clinic after a receptionist at his Anaheim 
office directed a reporter there. 
</P>
<P>
According to state records, the medical board in 1984 accused Turner of 
illegally prescribing dangerous drugs and placed his license on five years' 
probation. At the same time he pleaded no contest in Orange County misdemeanor 
court in a related case and was placed on three years' criminal probation and 
fined $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
Still, in a hearing on the drug-dispensing case, Administrative Law Judge W. F. 
Burns in February, 1984, wrote that Turner "has a reputation as a competent, 
conscientious physician with a special interest in good care of patients." 
Though Burns found Turner guilty of professional misconduct, his license was 
reinstated in full last year. 
</P>
<P>
According to Orange County court records, Turner was sued in 1988 for "wrongful 
death" by the parents of infant Ana Asia. The suit alleged that Turner caused 
the baby's death on Oct. 3, 1987, by failing to perform a "timely" Cesarean 
section. That lawsuit is not now part of the medical's board's June case, Tuton 
said Tuesday, but state investigators are still looking at court files.

HOME FOR WAYWARD GULLS

<P>
If it's true that birds of a feather usually flock together, nobody told Russ 
and Mildred. These two baby gulls had to be different. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of hatching on a remote island or rugged seaside cliff, as gulls are 
wont to do, the gull chicks were born in a cactus planter -- on a private dock, 
near crowded Balboa Pier, right outside William and June House's living room. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first breeding record of the Western gull in Orange County," said 
Sylvia Gallagher, a National Audubon Society member for almost 20 years and 
director of the Orange County Breeding Bird Atlas. 
</P>
<P>
"The closest they normally breed is on the Channel Islands. I didn't believe it 
until I saw them." 
</P>
<P>
The Houses' two-story home on Balboa Peninsula isn't exactly Santa Catalina 
Island. But for a mother bird in a pinch, it apparently was good enough. 
Chirping contentedly and closely guarded by their parents, the two fluffy 
gray-and-white chicks, now about 2 weeks old, seem unruffled by their 
waterfront home, with its panoramic view of the sun-drenched bay and fleets of 
colorful yachts. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought my claim to fame would be my husband's ear surgery. Not a bird," 
said June House, whose husband is a local ear surgeon. 
</P>
<P>
House didn't know her visiting chicks, which resemble ducklings, were unusual 
until one toppled out of the nest and she called the National Audubon Society 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
"This woman called me and said a baby sea gull had fallen out of its nest onto 
her deck and she wondered what to do," Gallagher said. "I said, 'Hey, it can't 
be a sea gull. Gulls don't nest around here.' But she insisted it was. She said 
she knew a sea gull when she saw one. She was quite offended. So I decided to 
toddle on down there, and she was right. It really was a gull." 
</P>
<P>
The baby gulls are the first to be recorded in Orange County and the first seen 
on the Southern California mainland between Point Loma and Point Conception 
since 1935, when a pair was spotted in La Jolla, Gallagher said. The Western 
gull is the most common sea gull found in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
"Since this area was settled, they haven't nested here," Gallagher said. "They 
are colonial birds, and there isn't room for a colony here." 
</P>
<P>
The gulls' new home is perched on some of the highest-priced real estate in 
Southern California. Most people, like the Houses, who have owned their bay 
shore retreat for 27 years, would call it their dream home. 
</P>
<P>
But for sea gulls, the first choice of residency is an isolated, rugged 
coastline, not jam-packed Balboa, with a backdrop of the towering high-rises of 
Newport Center. The peninsula gets so crowded that the summer motto among 
residents is "Bike it or boot it, but leave the car at home." 
</P>
<P>
Kimball Garrett, author of a widely used Southern California birding handbook, 
said the sea birds usually hatch on the Channel Islands and the remote seaside 
cliffs around San Luis Obispo, with some occasionally found nesting near Point 
Loma in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
"Sea birds have very little defense against mammalian predators, so any bird 
that nests on the ground in these heavily populated beach areas won't do very 
well," said Garrett, who is ornithology collection manager at the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Natural History. "They are normally island nesters." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps California is becoming so overpopulated with gulls that they are being 
crowded out of their usual breeding areas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not surprised that there are Western gulls out there looking for overflow 
nest sites," Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
Audubon experts said they don't know why the breeding pair chose the Houses' 
planter. But so far, the chicks, already about six inches long, are safe and 
healthy.

OFFICER SHOOTS, KILLS HIS ALLEGED ATTACKER

<P>
A police officer attempting to break up a domestic dispute shot and killed a 
man who allegedly hit him with a metal fan, Orange police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Ramon Ibarra Ibarra, 27, died at 10:09 p.m. Monday at Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana. He had been shot twice -- once in the left side of the chest 
and once in the buttocks, hospital spokeswoman Ellen Ball said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer, whose name was withheld pending an investigation by the Orange 
County district attorney's office, was treated for a head wound by his private 
doctor and released, Sgt. Bob Gustafson said. 
</P>
<P>
Ibarra's common-law wife, Connie Owen, said she called the police to their 
apartment on South Lemon Street after Ibarra came home from work in a rage and 
threatened to kill her and harm their five young children. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sorry for the policemen," Owen said as she sat on the front stoop of 
the apartment complex, still in a daze from the night of violence. "But they 
didn't have to shoot him. All I wanted was for them to take him away." 
</P>
<P>
Orange police and the district attorney's office, which routinely investigates 
officer-involved shootings, released only sketchy details of Monday's incident. 
</P>
<P>
Gustafson said Ibarra ignored orders to surrender, picked up the fan and swung 
it at the officer, hitting him in the head. The officer then opened fire. Owen 
described the fan as a three-foot-square metal fan. 
</P>
<P>
Gustafson declined to say how many shots were fired or how many officers were 
present at the time of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
With tears welling up in her eyes, Owen recounted the events that led up to 
Ibarra's death. 
</P>
<P>
She said that Ibarra came home about 9 p.m. and that the couple immediately got 
in a fight. He struck her and their 5-year-old daughter and appeared to be 
under the influence of drugs, she said. Police declined to comment on whether 
there was evidence of drugs or alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"He was just out of it on drugs," Owen said as she held her 3-month-old baby, 
Debbie. "He kept saying he was going to kill me. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen him mad before," she said of Ibarra, an immigrant from Mexico who 
had recently lost his job. "This time I thought he was going to kill me and the 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
Owen said she and the children fled the apartment, seeking refuge in a 
neighboring unit. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, Ibarra wandered out to a common area of the narrow complex 
and began screaming her name and shouting obscenities. He then walked back 
inside, she said. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, Owen said, she called police as she had a week earlier when he 
threatened her. 
</P>
<P>
Officers arrived at the apartment minutes later and went into the darkened 
home, Owen said. 
</P>
<P>
Owen said she stood outside and heard Ibarra taunting the officers. "They 
(police) said, 'Stop where you are.' But he kept screaming for them to come and 
get him." 
</P>
<P>
"The next thing I knew, I heard two shots. I knew it was Raymond who was hit. 
He doesn't have a gun." 
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, Owen said, she saw an officer "pacing back and forth in 
front of the building, all nervous. He was waving his arms and he looked really 
torn up, I could tell." 
</P>
<P>
The incident was the second officer-involved shooting in Orange County in a 
week, and the 10th this year. Three of the shootings, including Monday's, were 
fatal. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a sheriff's deputy critically wounded an armed man suspected of 
beating a taxicab driver with a .45-caliber automatic pistol, stealing his car 
and leading police on a freeway chase. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the district attorney's office ruled that Orange County officers 
were justified in the shooting deaths of two men in March and April. Two 
off-duty Los Angeles police officers who were working as security guards were 
exonerated in a third. 
</P>
<P>
One of the cases involved Orange police officers who killed Jose de Jesus Ramon 
Gonzalez, 27, in front of a Tustin convenience store. He was later found to be 
unarmed. 
</P>
<P>
District attorney investigators determined that police acted correctly because 
in all three cases the victims appeared to be pulling a weapon.

PLANNER IS 5TH TOP AIDE TO RESIGN POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Planning Director Thomas G. Merrell, who announced his resignation Monday, 
became the fifth top city staff member do so in the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
Merrell, 48, who had held his post for 14 years, said in a letter to City 
Manager Stephen B. Julian that he had been waiting for "quite some time" for 
the right moment to announce his resignation. He will remain at his 
$75,312-a-year post until another planning director is selected. 
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that this is the best timing, for me and the city, to retire from 
full-time public service and begin to pursue other personal goals I have held 
for a lifetime," Merrell said in his letter. 
</P>
<P>
Merrell's retirement comes in the midst of a restructuring of city staff by 
Julian. Merrell said the restructuring has been needed for some time and he 
will remain with the city until it is complete. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're doing is creating a more appropriate organizational structure for 
those who work in the city," Merrell said. "I'm expected to play a key role in 
implementing it." 
</P>
<P>
Along with Merrell, the city's public works director, city clerk, an assistant 
to the city manager and the director of community services all have left city 
service recently. Mary Ann Hanover, the former city clerk, and William Murphy, 
the former director of public works, also retired. Tom Baker, the former 
director of community services, now has his own photography business. 
</P>
<P>
Some in the community see the departures as evidence of lack of confidence in 
the city's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a clean sweep, five out of five department heads," said Carolyn Nash, a 
planning commissioner who also resigned last month. "I think it's due to a lack 
of proper management." 
</P>
<P>
Nash, whose husband is a former San Juan Capistrano mayor, quit after charging 
that the city was offering special treatment to some people, although she did 
not specify. She also claimed that the city's system of reviewing development 
was being circumvented by members of the City Council and the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
Merrell said there was little basis for Nash's criticism. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of the members of city commissions and boards are often forced to deal 
with issues at arm's length and are not able to be integrally involved with 
projects or with issues," Merrell said. "So it's easy to understand how a 
member of a commission can look at a decision and wonder how it came about." 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Phillip R. Schwartze, a former member of the planning staff who 
worked for Merrell, also disagreed that the resignations are signs of 
disgruntlement. 
</P>
<P>
"Tom has talked about this for some time and he was just waiting for the 
appropriate moment," Schwartze said. "He's been at the city for 14 years and 
was feeling stymied in his career. He knows he can make a lot more money as a 
consultant." 
</P>
<P>
Schwartze, the owner of the PRS Group, a real estate consulting firm, and a 
former member of the county Local Agency Formation Commission, also denied that 
the staff has been hit by undue turnover. 
</P>
<P>
"Our staff has been together longer than any other staff in Orange County," 
Schwartze said.LEN HALL

CITY BACKS OFF PLAN TO CURB RENT HIKES

<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed ordinance that would have limited rent increases at the city's three 
mobile home parks to 7% over the next year was killed by the City Council on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The council had tentatively approved the ordinance in an effort to persuade the 
owner of the Laguna Terrace Mobilehome Park to limit increases to that amount. 
</P>
<P>
But Tuesday night, council members unanimously agreed that owner Stephen 
Esslinger is treating tenants fairly and is willing to work with those who 
would be severely strained by larger rent increases. 
</P>
<P>
On June 5, after months of grappling with ways to stabilize rents at mobile 
home parks, the council lifted a six-month rent freeze while accepting 
agreements with owners of the other two parks, Treasure Island and Thurston. 
The Treasure Island agreement allows a 7% increase while freezing rents for 
low-income seniors. The Thurston Mobile Home Park accord allows a 6% increase 
but has no special provision for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Esslinger would agree only to keep rents in line with increases of the previous 
year. He was satisfied with the council's action Tuesday. "Fair is a subjective 
word. And what I thought was fair, the council thought was fair," he said.

114 ACRES ACCEPTED FOR BLUFF-TOP PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County officials accepted 114 acres of scruffy bluff land in Upper 
Newport Bay on Tuesday, ending a long legal and political battle to protect the 
area from development. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the action, long sought by environmentalists, won cheers from 
Back Bay residents and others Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's great," said Frank Robinson, who with his wife Frances led the charge to 
protect the bay from a development project proposed in the early 1960s. "This 
is the climax of a long effort, and I think it's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement completed Tuesday, the county will immediately take over 
the tract from the Irvine Co., assuming responsibility for patrolling the 
property and managing it. That is expected to cost about $80,000 for the first 
year. 
</P>
<P>
A $1-million private gift will pay for building a nature center on the land. 
The county will staff the center once it is running and expects to pay 
additional labor costs then as a result. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's action completes land acquisition for Upper Newport Bay Regional 
Park, 140 acres of scenic bluffs overlooking the Upper Newport Bay Ecological 
Reserve. The park, most of which is spread over a flat mesa perched above the 
water, will open on an interim basis within the next four to six weeks, said 
Bob Hamilton, manager of program planning for the county Harbors, Beaches and 
Parks Department. 
</P>
<P>
Although the park will feature trails and the nature center, it is not intended 
for heavy recreational use, in order to protect the birds and other wildlife 
that live and nest among the scrub grasses and bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most spectacular and environmentally sensitive areas of 
Southern California," Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, whose district includes the 
new park, said after the board session Tuesday. "This will be an important 
ecological preserve." JIM NEWTON

WANDERING RABBITS GET A REPRIEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNDA NATALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cute, yes, but there is a darker side to the floppy-eared, pink-nosed bunnies 
that have been allowed to roam Nature Park here for months: They have angered 
nearby residents by gnawing on their manicured lawns, jasmine plants and 
petunias. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the City Council this week just couldn't bear the thought of playing the 
role of Mr. McGregor by trapping dozens of the rabbits and sending them off to 
a possible death at the Orange County Animal Shelter. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, it voted Monday night to give the animals -- many apparently abandoned 
after being purchased as Easter presents -- a temporary reprieve while the city 
explores ways to keep the gentle critters out of the neighbors' yards. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no justification to me to remove those rabbits," Councilwoman Gail 
Kerry said at the meeting. "This is a nature park. It is perfectly natural to 
have rabbits there." The council's 4-1 decision -- Councilwoman Margaret Arnold 
cast the lone vote against the rabbits -- went against its staff recommendation 
to set out traps and catch what are believed to be as many as 30 bunnies for 
shipment to the shelter, which holds the animals for a time to see if anyone 
will adopt them. If no one claimed them, the rabbits would be destroyed, city 
officials conceded. 
</P>
<P>
The reprieve will give the city three to five weeks to rabbit-proof two metal 
park gates that currently have enough of a gap on the bottom that a hungry 
bunny can squeeze under them to get to neighboring lawns. In a twist that would 
make Peter Rabbit proud, council members ordered that, while fixing the gate, 
city staffers are to capture any errant bunnies and place them inside park on 
Ball Road. 
</P>
<P>
Will the plan work? Neighbors are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"They are a real nuisance," said Via Largo resident Estelle Seaton, who has had 
several of her plants munched on by the rabbits. "I just don't see how they can 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
Added David James, lamenting the state of his mother's lawn on Via Largo: 
"There are a lot of patches of grass missing." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the rabbits are contained, their gift for proliferation has city 
administrators worried. "We are not trained to take care of those kinds of 
animals," said Robert Beardsley, director of public works. "Once we keep them, 
then what do we do with them?" 
</P>
<P>
Beardsley argued that keeping the rabbits penned inside the small park may even 
prove to be deadly, since part of the nature area is a flood basin. If the 
basin ever filled, the bunnies would drown. 
</P>
<P>
"They will not be able to escape from the fenced area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, word is out about the bunnies in Nature Park. People keep dumping 
their unwanted rabbits there, and some have taken to bringing food for them, 
many of which are tame and very approachable, say city officials. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't the first time the city has tried to capture the rabbits. Last 
month, city staff members set out a trap but were foiled by an apparent animal 
rights activist who stole it. Immediately afterward, the city began receiving 
calls from sympathetic citizens who chided officials for trying to get rid of 
the bunnies. 
</P>
<P>
The council is expected to reevaluate the bunny brouhaha at its July 23 
meeting.LYNDA NATALI

$13,000 OKD TO TEST QUALITY OF WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council will spend $13,000 to drill wells and see whether a spill of 
potentially hazardous hydrocarbons poses a threat to ground-water quality. 
</P>
<P>
The spill occurred in 1988 when a 550-gallon underground reserve fuel tank was 
removed from the city yard, Director of Public Works Fred Wickman said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the tank had been emptied, at least a gallon of gasoline remained 
inside and leaked onto the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, for years, tanks there had no receptacles to catch spilled 
gasoline when vehicles were fueled. 
</P>
<P>
The spill concerns public health officials because the ground-water level there 
is eight feet below the surface. However, no wells exist near the area, so 
drinking water would not likely be affected, Wickman said. 
</P>
<P>
In April, an investigation of the city yard site at 10652 Bell St. revealed 
high levels of toxic hydrocarbons, xylene and ethylbenzene. 
</P>
<P>
"Our evaluation is that the contamination is localized," said Jim Severns, an 
official of Earth Technology Corp., charged with installing the monitoring 
wells. 
</P>
<P>
The recent study found no contaminants in any of five bore holes made within a 
few yards of the site, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, Severns said the Orange County Health Care Agency and state guidelines 
require that the monitoring wells be used to make sure that the ground water is 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
If the ground water is contaminated, the city must pump the water out, cleanse 
it and replace it. Wickman said the results of the water tests should be known 
within 45 days. JON NALICK

A 19-year-old Long Beach woman who allegedly struck and killed a motorcyclist 
on a dimly lit residential street turned herself in to police after initially 
leaving the scene, authorities said Tuesday.

Police said Suzanne Montague was apparently making a left turn on Foster Road

trail bike. California Highway Patrol spokesman Lyle Whitten said the man was 
traveling south on Foster at the time of the accident.

The name of the victim, a 37-year-old Rossmoor man, was withheld until his 
family could be notified. Whitten said he was knocked about 80 feet off his 
motorcycle and onto the pavement, suffering massive head and internal injures. 
Efforts to revive him were unsuccessful and he was pronounced dead at Long 
Beach Memorial Hospital at 10:10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Whitten said that investigators suspect the small motorcycle's headlights were 
not on at the time of the crash. In addition, he said, the intersection wasn't 
brightly lit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not real bright at the scene, so it may have been very difficult for 
this motorcyclist to be seen," Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
After hitting the man, Montague pulled over and stopped, Whitten said. She 
later told investigators she looked around, didn't see anything and took off, 
Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
"She went home and told her mother . . . she was involved in some type of 
accident," Whitten said. Her mother then called the CHP and brought her 
daughter to the Westminster CHP station at about 11:30 p.m., he said. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview with an investigator, Montague said she was not sure if she 
had hit the motorcyclist but knew she had hit something, Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no indication at the scene or at the station that she had been 
drinking, Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers arrested her on suspicion of felony hit and run but "due to the fact 
that she did voluntarily come into the office and since we are looking for 
witnesses, we released her pending further investigation," Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach Montague were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
The car she was driving, a 1984 Toyota Tercel, was parked in front of her Long 
Beach home and was later impounded by the CHP and placed in a secured area, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"The car had extensive left front damage and blood splatterings on the left 
fender," Whitten said. "There was glass and debris found at the scene that 
matches the car." He added that the CHP will attempt to match the blood to the 
victim's blood. There were no skid marks at the scene, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It is entirely possible for the average motorist not to have seen this guy," 
Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
The headlight and taillight were taken off the motorcycle and sent to the crime 
lab to determine whether they were lit at the time of the accident "but it 
appears they were off," Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
"We also had a witness who saw the motorcyclist before the accident traveling 
down one of the surface streets without headlights on," Whitten said. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office said that tests will be 
conducted on the victim's blood alcohol level as required by state law. 
</P>
<P>
After an investigation, the case will be brought to the Orange County district 
attorney, who will determine if charges will be filed.

MISSING AIRPORT MARBLE TRAVELING BY AIR; 
</P>
<P>
CONSTRUCTION: THE NEW TERMINAL'S FACING FELL VICTIM TO A SHIPPING MISTAKE, NOW 
CORRECTED. BUT WHO PAYS THE FREIGHT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Managers for Orange County's $310-million airport expansion were doing a 
routine inventory check a few weeks ago to gear up for a new phase of 
construction when they discovered the unthinkable: The marble was missing. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not exactly missing. The problem was that some of the beige, ridged 
marble that is to adorn much of the new airport terminal had not arrived in the 
first place. It was still in West Germany, the victim of a fouled-up shipping 
order. 
</P>
<P>
In a project already five months over target and millions of dollars over 
budget, the missing marble was but the latest snafu in efforts to usher 
outdated John Wayne Airport into the 1990s with a new terminal. 
</P>
<P>
So, intent on finishing the new terminal by the current Sept. 16 deadline, 
Taylor Woodrow Construction California -- the company that has come under fire 
for its management of the project and was fired last month from an airport 
parking garage project -- decided to rush the marble from West Germany via air 
freight. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the material -- to be used in lining floors, columns and other areas of 
a ground-level section of the terminal -- made it Tuesday to Orange County. 
Another planeload is due later. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're doing whatever needs to be done," Taylor Woodrow spokeswoman 
Judy Johnson said. "The first thing is to get the stuff here, and we think 
we've got that resolved." 
</P>
<P>
Airport and county officials described the marble mishap as minor and said such 
hitches are inevitable in a project as complex as the airport expansion. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, said Jan Mittermeier, assistant airport manager, "I think it's more of 
a headache for the contractor than for us. . . . Our concern is just that they 
finish the building on time, whatever that takes, and we need to make sure they 
have enough marble." 
</P>
<P>
Mittermeier and airport project director Alan Murphy also asserted that any 
additional cost for the rush shipment would not fall to the county. 
</P>
<P>
But Taylor Woodrow's Johnson would not give such assurances, nor would she 
discuss how much extra it may cost to rush the marble by air freight or how 
much marble was involved. 
</P>
<P>
She said that the confusion came after project officials discussed changing the 
thickness of the marble and that a previous order was apparently canceled, but 
a second one at the new measurements never went through. 
</P>
<P>
Responsibility for that, she said, is with the West German marble supplier. But 
if the firm does not accept the added cost of shipment and passes it along to 
Taylor Woodrow, "a portion of (the added cost) could legitimately fall to the 
county. . . . I can't rule that out." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson also said the shipment problem should not delay the opening. 
</P>
<P>
In touring the terminal Tuesday afternoon, Airport Manager George Rebella 
pointed to a group of construction workers not doing anything at the time and 
said they had to wait for more marble to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't do anything until it gets here," he said.

BIDS ON HIGH-SPEED TRAIN DERAILED; 
</P>
<P>
CONSTRUCTION: MORRISON-KNUDSEN AND BOMBARDIER CORP. APPARENTLY DROP OUT, 
LEAVING ONLY BECHTEL INTERNATIONAL INTERESTED IN ANAHEIM-LAS VEGAS LINK.

<P>
Two companies that were expected to compete for the chance to build a 
high-speed rail line from Anaheim to Las Vegas have apparently pulled out of 
the competition, leaving only one other bidder. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Taylor, executive director of the California-Nevada Super Speed Ground 
Transportation Commission, said Tuesday that he strongly doubts that 
Montreal-based Bombardier Corp. and Boise-based Morrison-Knudsen will file a 
formal proposal to build and operate a rail system by next Monday's 
commission-imposed deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect them to bid," Taylor said. Citing a June 22 letter to the 
commission and the firms' presentation at a recent meeting, Taylor said 
Bombardier argued that the project would be "excessively risky" financially 
without planning and other assistance at state government expense. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor said Bombardier and Morrison-Knudsen had been attempting to prepare a 
single bid on the $4-billion project rather than submit two separate proposals. 
</P>
<P>
Bombardier and Morrison-Knudsen officials could not be reached for comment 
Tuesday. The companies were known to favor construction of a French-built rail 
system known as TGV on the 275-mile route. 
</P>
<P>
The only other firm to have expressed a desire to build the line is San 
Francisco-based Bechtel International Inc., which favors a German-built train 
known as "mag-lev" because it is propelled by a magnetic field. 
</P>
<P>
Bechtel officials said Tuesday that they don't believe the loss of competing 
firms will give them any ability to dictate terms to the bistate train 
commission, most members of which are quite taken with the mag-lev idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really think so," said Ervon R. Koenig, Bechtel's senior vice 
president and the man in charge of the company's high-speed rail proposal. "We 
would not have gotten into negotiations with the commission until it made its 
selection of a franchise. But this may accelerate the process a little bit, 
because we won't have these competing technologies anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Koenig said he could not respond to Bombardier's letter indicating that the 
project needs a publicly subsidized process for planning and getting project 
permits, except to say that his firm has already committed millions of dollars 
to that effort. 
</P>
<P>
But he repeated the company's longstanding position that even if the train 
commission awards Bechtel a franchise, his firm will still need to do a final 
feasibility study that could make or break the project. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Supervisor Don R. Roth, a strong advocate of mag-lev, said he is 
not ruling out bids by Bombardier and Morrison-Knudsen, since he has seen no 
formal statement from either firm that definitively seeks to remove them from 
further consideration. 
</P>
<P>
But Roth said neither firm has been pursuing the project with much relish. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should I have spent all this time analyzing and riding the TGV if they 
weren't going to submit a proposal," Roth said testily. "They knew all along 
that the commission was insisting on totally privatized financing." 
</P>
<P>
Roth said that in the end, Bechtel's proposal may be found unacceptable. "It's 
possible that the whole thing could be scrapped," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Bechtel is awarded a franchise as the lone bidder, Roth said, he 
believes there are sufficient "checks and balances." 
</P>
<P>
Both the California and Nevada legislatures, which set up the bistate train 
commission, must ratify the franchise award, which is also dependent on 
Congress providing federally owned rights of away along Interstate 15 free of 
charge. That legislation is still pending.

Emily Short turned in another outstanding performance Tuesday night, breaking 
the U.S. Olympic Festival record in the 200-meter breaststroke by more than 
four seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Short, 14, who Monday night swam the second-fastest 100 breaststroke in the 
world this year, finished the 200 in 2 minutes 32.71 seconds. The previous 
festival record of 2:36.83 was set in 1987 by Laura Gandrud of Bloomington, 
Minn. 
</P>
<P>
"I now feel I have more of a chance (to make the '92 Olympic team) than I did a 
week ago," said Short, of Phoenix. "I'm more positive about it now than after 
last night. I just have to work a lot harder than I have been." 
</P>
<P>
Sean Gouldson of Chelmsford, Mass., won the 100 backstroke in 57.37 seconds, 
breaking the festival record of 57.51 set by Rick Carey in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Eight festival swimming records were set in the three days of competition. 
</P>
<P>
Travis Ford's layup with seven seconds left gave the South a 121-120 victory 
over the North in the gold-medal basketball game, and after the bronze-medal 
game, Princeton Coach Pete Carril declared he had had enough of all-star teams. 
</P>
<P>
The East women beat the West, 76-54, for the gold. 
</P>
<P>
Ford, a guard at Missouri, finished with 24 points to lead the South, which won 
despite a low-scoring night from 7-foot-1 Shaquille O'Neal of LSU. O'Neal had 
89 points in the first three games but scored only nine on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Damon Bailey, whose three-pointer had given the North a 120-119 lead with 17 
seconds remaining, led his team with 25. 
</P>
<P>
In the women's game, the East broke away quickly at the start of each half in 
rolling to victory. Tracy Lis of Providence led the winners with 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
Val Whiting of NCAA champion Stanford led the West with 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
In the bronze-medal games, the East men beat the West, 101-98, and the North 
women beat the South, 76-74, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
After his team won the bronze, Carril said: 
</P>
<P>
"No offense to the guys on my team, but this makes me appreciate my players (at 
Princeton). These guys worry too much about how many minutes they're going to 
play, who's going to take the shot, who's going to do this. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them yesterday, 'You guys sleep together, you stay in the same dorm, 
you eat together and yet when guys are wide open, you pass them up.' " 
</P>
<P>
In archery, 46-year-old Barry Weinperl set a final-round Grand FITA record with 
334 points after almost not qualifying for the six-man finals. 
</P>
<P>
Weinperl's victory marked the second consecutive year the oldest archer has won 
the event. In 1989, Ed Eliason of Stansbury Park, Utah, won it at age 50. 
</P>
<P>
Weinperl's score for 36 arrows eclipsed the previous final-round record of 332 
by Jay Barrs of Tempe, Ariz., in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Watson of Chesapeake, Ohio, rolled a 300 game during the five-player event 
to match the perfect game rolled last year by Gordon Vadakin of Wichita, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
Watson, 23, was an All-American in 1989 and plans on turning professional after 
the festival.

NEWPORT BEACH DUKES' FUTURE LOOKS BRIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
The Newport Beach Dukes made their debut Tuesday at the John Wayne Tennis Club 
where: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A light rain fell, a dubious beginning if ever there was one. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Marty Davis, the Dukes' most experienced player, was seen chomping potato 
chips while watching the women's doubles set. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A crowd of about 1,200 was entertained by Roger Smith's 6-5 victory over 
Mike Briggs in the men's singles set. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Dukes defeated an alumni team from UC Irvine in an exhibition, 30-16. 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes begin the regular season against the Raleigh Edge at 7:30 p.m. 
Thursday at the John Wayne Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to base much on Tuesday's exhibition, but the Dukes appear to 
have a strong lineup. 
</P>
<P>
There remains much to be determined, however. Who plays with whom, for 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Greg Patton decided on Tuesday's lineup on a whim. Now, he has something 
to go by for Thursday's opener. 
</P>
<P>
He is, to say the least, impressed with his team. 
</P>
<P>
"All the chapters are in the book," Patton said. "It's going to be a great 
novel." 
</P>
<P>
Translation: The Dukes have depth, talent, strong singles and doubles. And they 
could be one of the league's top teams. 
</P>
<P>
The women -- Sophie Amiach and Amy Frazier -- overpowered Karin Behring and 
Colleen Patton, 6-0, to begin the match. 
</P>
<P>
Frazier then beat Mary Beth Young, granted honorary alumni status by virtue of 
her work this week at the UCI tennis camp, 6-4. Young is a two-time 
All-American from Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
The Smith-Briggs set was the highlight of the match, going to a tiebreaker 
after it was tied, 5-5. (Team Tennis scoring differs greatly from standard tour 
scoring). 
</P>
<P>
Smith won the nine-point (another difference) tiebreaker, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
That match tested Patton's allegiance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like I adopted some children, but on the other side of the river are 
all my other children," he said. "I felt like running over and cheering for 
Mike Briggs." 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes' victory marked Team Tennis' return to Orange County after a 
seven-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
Two previous teams folded after disappointing results on the court and at the 
box office. The Anaheim Oranges folded in 1978 and the California Oranges in 
1983.

Mark your calendars, football fans. The Texas Tech Red Raiders of the Southwest 
Conference are coming to Cal State Fullerton to play the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
In 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton athletic department announced Tuesday that it has reached an 
agreement with Texas Tech on a two-for-one, home-and-home series. 
</P>
<P>
The Titans will travel to Lubbock, Tex., to play the Red Raiders on Sept. 7, 
1991 and Sept. 16, 1995. Texas Tech will travel to Fullerton for a game on 
Sept. 18, 2004. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll just roll over from the Gerontology Center for our home game," said Titan 
Coach Gene Murphy, who will be 65 in 2004. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Athletic Director Ed Carroll described the contract as "a 
continuation of our commitment to schedule quality opponents at home." 
</P>
<P>
The Titans now have home-and-home contracts with Colorado State, Temple, Akron, 
Texas El Paso, Army and Mississippi State. 
</P>
<P>
The 1991 game against Texas Tech will take the place of a previously scheduled 
game against Southwest Louisiana, which was dropped by mutual agreement between 
the two schools. MIKE DiGIOVANNA

CONSTRUCTION OF OFFICE SPACE DROPS SHARPLY; 
</P>
<P>
BUILDING: A YEAR AGO, THERE WAS A TOTAL OF 3.9 MILLION SQUARE FEET UNDER 
DEVELOPMENT. THIS YEAR, THE FIGURE HAS DECLINED TO 2.8 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Those inveterate gamblers, the developers, are getting their credit shut off, 
and it has resulted in a big drop in office construction in Orange County this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Last year at this time there were 3.9 million square feet of office space under 
construction. That's more than 80 football fields' worth. 
</P>
<P>
Now there is only 2.8 million under construction, officials of Grubb &amp; 
Ellis Co, a commercial real estate broker, said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The reason for the drop: Banks that loaned money on construction projects -- 
and pension funds and insurance companies that invested in them -- have been 
burned in such troubled real estate markets as Denver and Dallas. They're not 
anxious to repeat the mistake in Orange County, which has way more office space 
than it can use even though plenty of tenants are still looking for space here. 
</P>
<P>
New federal regulations after the savings and loan crisis have also made it 
difficult for even healthy thrifts to do a lot of lending in commercial real 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
"The lenders are getting a lot more sophisticated, and they want to tune the 
market into demand more," said John J. Brodbeck, research director for Grubb 
&amp; Ellis' Orange County operations. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the glut of space and ominously high vacancy rates often prevent 
landlords from charging reasonable rents. They're also handing out months' 
worth of free rent to get tenants to sign a lease and promising them lots of 
money to put the finishing touches on their new offices. 
</P>
<P>
The vacancy rate was 21% at the end of the first half of the year in the 
county's 670 larger office buildings, Grubb &amp; Ellis said in its midyear 
report. The vacancy rate was unchanged from last year. 
</P>
<P>
The one bright spot for landlords is the construction figures. In 1988, office 
space under construction hit a record 5.2 million square feet, equal to nearly 
a dozen of South Coast Plaza's Center Tower office buildings, at 21 stories the 
county's largest. But last year it slipped to 3.2 million and this year it will 
probably be even less, says Grubb &amp; Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there are 11 million square feet of empty office space around the 
county, nearly 5 million in the John Wayne Airport area alone, the county's new 
"downtown" and its biggest office neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
In the event of a recession, that much empty space represents a "higher risk" 
to the economy of Orange County than that faced by some less active markets 
where fewer office buildings have been built, said Dennis W. Macheski, Grubb 
&amp; Ellis' southwest regional research director. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the amount of construction hasn't dropped near the airport much at 
all. The huge developers operating there, such as the Koll Co. and the Irvine 
Co., can still get lenders to trust them by virtue of their size. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a lot of developers have delayed projects near the airport and "there 
would be a lot more construction there today if it weren't for the thrift mess 
and the fact there are too many buildings there already," said Ron McElroy, a 
Grubb &amp; Ellis broker. 
</P>
<P>
Most of this year's drop in construction occurred instead in the southern, 
less-developed half of the county, where a burst of construction last year has 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
The scarcity of lenders has hampered smaller developers in the South County, 
McElroy said. Another reason for the drop: Most of last year's construction 
occurred at the Irvine Spectrum, the Irvine Co.'s massive business park at the 
intersection of the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways. But fewer tenants are 
knocking on doors there this year, McElroy said. The Irvine Co. has raised land 
prices at Spectrum, scaring away some possible tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't need any more (office) space down here anyway," McElroy said. 
</P>
<P>
Developers often keep developing if there's money available, even in the face 
of a glut of buildings, because they need projects to keep their organizations 
working. 
</P>
<P>
But some have turned cautious in the central part of the county -- the older 
cities of Santa Ana, Anaheim and Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the big developers operating there are waiting to sign up a big tenant 
before building an office tower, said Chip Greene, a Grubb &amp; Ellis broker. 
Meanwhile, that market is beginning to look better and better: The last big 
office building to open there was in November, 1988. 
</P>

Persistently high vacancy rates and tightening credit have finally started to

SOUTH COAST PLAZA FESTIVAL TAKES ON BRITISH ACCENT; 
</P>
<P>
CELEBRATION: OFFICIALS AT COSTA MESA MALL LAUNCH FOUR-MONTH FESTIVAL 
CELEBRATING BRITISH CULTURE AND COMMERCE.

<P>
South Coast Plaza is preparing to adopt a British accent. 
</P>
<P>
Plaza officials joined members of the British government, local arts luminaries 
and civic leaders Tuesday in kicking off the Festival of Britain, a four-month 
celebration of British culture and commerce that culminates in October with 
three weeks of festivities at the Costa Mesa shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
Reg Holloway, British consul general in Los Angeles, said the festival is the 
biggest event sponsored by the British government in North America this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally the idea was for a retail promotion based in South Coast Plaza, but 
the festival has grown to something bigger," Holloway said. "It seemed to 
blossom on its own. It was a festival waiting to happen." 
</P>
<P>
A succession of speakers wearing understated Festival of Britain lapel pins 
spoke to reporters and guests. Among the guests were Costa Mesa Mayor Peter F. 
Buffa and Henry T. Segerstrom, developer and part-owner of South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The big announcement of the day was that a member of the British royal family 
-- probably Princess Alexandria, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II -- will visit 
at some time during the festival. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the festival, Saks Fifth Avenue is planning an invitation-only 
cocktail party and fashion show. Great Britain's Chelsea Crafts and Flower Show 
will be re-created at the shopping center. A display of coronation robes 
spanning 300 years is planned, as is an exhibition of more than 150 art and 
design objects dating from 1790 to the present from London's Victoria &amp; 
Albert Museum. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-October, the shopping center will host a Renaissance Faire with court 
jesters and musicians celebrating old England, and a British classic car show. 
</P>
<P>
British fashion designer Zandra Rhodes and hologram photographer Alexander are 
expected to make appearances at the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
Brochures, banners, flags and hang tags for merchandise imported from Great 
Britain are being designed for the event. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Devin, store manager of Nordstrom and co-chairman of the retail section 
of the festival, said 1.6 million people are expected during the three weeks of 
the festival. 
</P>
<P>
South Coast Plaza general manager Jim Henwood said it is too early to tell how 
much business the festival will generate for the mall, which holds eight anchor 
stores and more than 200 smaller outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Among the groups performing in the festival are Britain's D'Oyly Carte Opera 
Company and the London Classical Players. Local participants include South 
Coast Repertory, Pacific Symphony, Grove Shakespeare Festival and the Laguna 
Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Seminars about technology exchange and investing in the European Community, an 
economic cooperative of European states to be formed in 1992, will be held at 
UC Irvine and at Chapman College. 
</P>
<P>
On the arts and community side, the festival committee is contributing about $1 
million to the events, and various arts groups are contributing another $1 
million, Houlton said. 
</P>
<P>
Major sponsors are the city of Costa Mesa, Virgin Atlantic Airways, the British 
Council and the British government through the consul general in Los Angeles. 
South Coast Plaza is among the other contributors. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Stack, a retail analyst with the Los Angeles investment firm Bateman 
Eichler, Hill Richards, said she has heard of individual stores, but not entire 
shopping centers, adopting a country as a promotional tool. She said British 
goods will sell especially well in this area. "In Southern California, for some 
reason, there is a lot of interest in England and English products," she said. 
"People associate quality and craftsmanship with the products." 
</P>
<P>
Although little mention was made of it Tuesday, the Festival of Britain has a 
predecessor. In 1972, South Coast Plaza held a small retail festival that never 
blossomed the way the current one has to include arts and community events. 
</P>
<P>
John Houlton, vice consul for the British government in Los Angeles, said this 
festival was supposed to have been a revival of the 1972 event. But as Orange 
County has changed, so has the scope of the festival. "Orange County is so much 
bigger in all senses," said Houlton, who was also involved in the 1972 
festival. "More cosmopolitan is a good way to put it."

FDA REFUSES TO LIFT BAN ON SALE OF FOOD SUPPLEMENT L-TRYPTOPHAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that it will not allow 
L-tryptophan back on the market, despite a call by the Costa Mesa-based 
National Nutritional Foods Assn. to lift the agency's ban on the food 
supplement. 
</P>
<P>
The FDA's statement in Washington came despite news that a study will be 
published today in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. indicating that an 
epidemic of a potentially fatal blood disorder may be linked to only one 
manufacturer of the food supplement. 
</P>
<P>
An Oregon study by the Centers for Disease Control indicated that a worldwide 
epidemic last year of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome "was caused by a 
contaminant or an alteration in a subset of L-tryptophan manufactured by a 
single company in Japan shortly before the outbreak began," said the study's 
lead investigator, Dr. Laurence Slutsker. 
</P>
<P>
Slutsker said that the Minnesota Health Department has completed a similar 
study, as yet unpublished, that also links the disease to one manufacturer, 
Showa Kenko of Japan. He added that preliminary results of studies by state 
health departments of New Mexico and New York have yielded the same finding. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa group, which represents health food retailers and manufacturers, 
and other health food industry officials argue that these studies give 
sufficient evidence that L-tryptophan produced by five other Japanese firms is 
safe and should be allowed back on the market as a treatment for ailments such 
as insomnia and premenstrual syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
However, the FDA in its statement Tuesday said that additional studies of a 
wider geographic area are needed to determine whether the contaminants being 
found in L-tryptophan cause EMS or simply are indicators of another agent that 
causes the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Slutsker said that putting L-tryptophan back on the market now without further 
studies would be "premature."

STAGE: A LANDLUBBER ACTOR TRODS THE BOARDS OF A BRIG TO BRING 'TWO YEARS BEFORE 
THE MAST' ALIVE IN DANA POINT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
When actor Daniel Trent set out to adapt Richard Henry Dana's "Two Years Before 
the Mast" for the stage, he thought that crewing a yacht up the Northern 
California coast would give him a feel for Dana's life at sea. 
</P>
<P>
But when the ship left San Francisco Bay, it hit "20-foot waves every six 
seconds for the next four days." And the actor-writer became a confirmed 
landlubber. 
</P>
<P>
Lack of sea legs has not stopped Trent from taking California audiences on a 
dramatized sailing adventure with his one-man show of Dana's classic. 
</P>
<P>
"Two Years Before the Mast," which premiered in 1981 on Pilgrim -- the ship 
moored in Dana Point Harbor that is a replica of the original brig on which 
Dana worked -- opened again on the ship Saturday and will continue with two 
performances each Friday and Saturday night through July. The show is a 
presentation of the Orange County Marine Institute, also at Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean breezes set the mood, and the Pilgrim's deck becomes a stage as audiences 
sit below the ship's 96-foot mainmast to hear Trent spin his tale. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes you get lucky and the fog rolls in and you get to transport the 
whole audience," Trent said. "Then it becomes magic." 
</P>
<P>
Trent re-creates seven characters from Dana's true-life story, excerpting 
directly from the book to recount the young sailor's two years in the service 
of a tyrannical captain. 
</P>
<P>
The story introduces Dana at 42 as he reminisces about his two-year journey 
aboard a trading ship. Then the script travels back to 1834, when the 
18-year-old Dana began his adventure from Boston Harbor around Cape Horn and up 
the unsettled California coast, where Pilgrim traded fireworks and saddles for 
animal hides. 
</P>
<P>
The crew encountered pirate attacks and dangerous waters as well as the cruel 
hand of their merciless captain. The young Dana, one of Boston's sheltered 
elite, came of age during the trip that introduced him to injustice and death, 
as well as the unfamiliar Spanish-Catholic culture of California. 
</P>
<P>
Dana's account of the trip was first published in 1840 and is now in its 91st 
edition. His frank depiction of the hardships faced by sailors helped to reform 
maritime law, Trent said. And because the book provided rare information about 
life on the California coast, the book became a bible for Gold Rush hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
During nine years performing the show for historical societies, student groups 
and community organizations, Trent has approximated Dana's path up the 
California coast with his portrayal. 
</P>
<P>
But the play seems to belong most in the city that Dana called "the only 
romantic spot in California." The town returned this compliment by officially 
adopting Dana's name in 1884; a statue of the author now welcomes visitors to 
Harbor Island, near Pilgrim's mooring at Dana Cove Park and overlooking the 
harbor entrance. 
</P>
<P>
Trent, who adapted the "Two Years Before the Mast" with partner Victor 
Pinheiro, said he never tires of retelling Dana's tale of adventure. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I will do Dana as long as someone wants me to do it," he said. "I just 
love the show. It's a beautiful piece, and I'm real proud that I had a hand in 
creating it. Heck, I'm the best one who's ever done the show -- I'm the only 
one who's ever done it!" 
</P>
<P>
And after nine years of re-creating Dana's history, Trent said: "I think I know 
his inner life pretty well. I think he was a wonderful, noble being. But I feel 
sad for him sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
Dana returned to Boston and his father, also named Richard Henry Dana, and 
became a lawyer, leaving behind his life of risk and romance. Trent believes 
that Dana turned his back on his true destiny: 
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the show Dana says, 'My thoughts wander back to my old sea life. 
. . . I believe I was made for the sea and all my life on shore was a mistake.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 "Two Years Before the Mast" continues Fridays and Saturdays at 6:30 and 9 p.m. 
through July 28 on the Pilgrim at Dana Point Harbor, 24200 Dana Point Harbor 
Drive, Dana Point. Tickets: $26. Information: (714) 496-2274.

FIVE MEMBERS OF JOHN CLIFFORD'S BALLET OF LOS ANGELES -- INCLUDING ALLEGRA 
KENT, THE FORMER BALANCHINE-ERA NEW YORK CITY BALLET STAR -- ARE LEADING 
CLASSES.

<P>
For the next three weeks, Orange County's aspiring dancers have a chance to rub 
shoulders -- and toe shoes -- with one of the legendary names from the 
Balanchine-era New York City Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
Allegra Kent, for whom Balanchine originated roles in his "Agon" and 
"Brahms-Schoenberg Quartet," among other works, is one of five members of John 
Clifford's Ballet of Los Angeles who are leading classes, through Aug. 3, at 
the Jimmie DeFore Dance Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
For her part, teaching at a small, out-of-the-way studio is a way of preserving 
and passing on the Balanchine tradition, away from the glimmer of spotlights 
and curtain calls. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun to teach and see what happens," said Kent, 52. "There is a bit of 
improvisation between the steps the teacher teaches, the music the pianist 
plays and how the student chooses to present that." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Kent, who left NYCB in 1983, the teachers include Clifford, 43, 
a member of the New York City Ballet from 1967 until he left to found the 
now-defunct Los Angeles Ballet in 1975; Alla Khaniashvili-Artiushkina, a former 
principal dancer with the Bolshoi Ballet; New York City Ballet principal Darci 
Kistler, and Johnna Kirkland, a former soloist with NYCB and a principal dancer 
with Los Angeles Ballet. (The Los Angeles Ballet folded in 1985.) 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, someone has to have the same teacher to progress," Kent said. "But 
it's very good to get some ideas from the outside. If someone says something in 
a different way, or in an unusual way, if you hear something that is unusual, 
you can change something about yourself. Certainly studying dance is a process 
of changing and trying to perfect or approach it differently." 
</P>
<P>
A native Angelina, Kent also is artistic director of the Stamford City Ballet 
in Connecticut and associate director of the Ballet of Los Angeles, founded by 
Clifford in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
While demonstrating that movement is an important part of the teaching process, 
Kent said she also talks a lot when she works with young dancers. 
</P>
<P>
"About 15 things immediately come to mind that you must say," she said. "You 
can tell immediately their approach and certain things, and as a class 
progresses, you see more and more. I feel I can say some very important things. 
I can see a little and say quite a bit." 
</P>
<P>
But Kent also said she realizes the importance of not overloading a student. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like being a psychiatrist," she said. "You can't possibly say everything 
or the person wouldn't have a chance. So you choose one or two very important 
things to focus on. . . . I usually tell them to relate to their own body. Most 
dancers don't." 
</P>
<P>
Kent continues to take a ballet class daily but said mastering technique is not 
an end-all in itself. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest dancers are not the most perfect dancers, although they might 
be," she said. "(Greatness) is different things -- spirit fire." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, she said, dancing has become "quite standardized in some ways. Whether 
it's television or video, everybody learns the same thing. I don't know what it 
is. . . . Some dancing is drab." 
</P>
<P>
No, she would not mention any names. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been that way," she said. "I like to go to the ballet and other 
dance and see some unusual, exquisite, transcendent thing happen, or else, why 
bother? You could go to the aquarium." 
</P>
<P>
Kent and the others are teaching in Orange County in part because Clifford 
could not find studio space in Los Angeles for his dancers. 
</P>
<P>
"The existing schools are packed," Clifford said. "They really don't have any 
time. We need three-four hours a day, minimum. I couldn't find any space." 
</P>
<P>
Into the breach stepped Gloria DeFore, who offered Clifford her studio space. 
"It's the best thing I've seen in Los Angeles or Orange County, and she had the 
time," Clifford said. 
</P>
<P>
Clifford called the four-week session "an experiment," but he has sights on the 
future too. 
</P>
<P>
"If we see enough interest, we will continue in the fall," he said. "We could 
work this into full time." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, "if something happens in Orange County, if there is an 
interest, if these workshops do well, I may move down, change the name (of the 
company). But I would have to be approached. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I did the Los Angeles Ballet for 10 years. I'm not about to run around 
fund-raising for a community that doesn't want to have a company. . . . If not, 
I will keep the company as I have it. It's a small touring company. We stay in 
the black, break even, and I don't have to fund-raise." 
</P>

It took three years for Clifford's new company to reach its namesake city. 
Clifford said financial problems and a busy schedule kept the 11-member Ballet 
of Los Angeles away until April. 
</P>
<P>
Clifford's own schedule, he said, has kept him very busy. He arrived from Italy 
the night before classes began this week. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to the states to find some disturbing trends in dance, he said: 
"There is a very big trend in ballet companies in America, where boards of 
directors are assuming more and more artistic control of the company. 
</P>
<P>
"I can understand why board members, being businessmen themselves, think in 
terms of having a businessman run the company. That's fine, up to a point. I 
think one should be fiscally responsible. But I don't think boards should be 
telling artistic director what to do, which I think is happening more and 
more." 
</P>
<P>
Even more upsetting, he said, is the controversy about National Endowment of 
the Arts funding. "I think it's a mess, disgusting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very upset it's gotten even this far. Talk about censorship, it's 
outrageous this would would happen in this country. When I was in Europe, I 
felt embarrassed for America that (Congress) would even get to the point where 
they would even consider censorship of artists -- because it won't stop there. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to be in a position to defend our government because our 
government is more repressive than East Germany is as far as the arts are 
concerned. They don't have these questions in France, Germany or Italy. There, 
if some things are shocking, the better they're regarded."

PROBLEMS OF PACING AND ACTING BLEMISH 'THE GLASS MENAGERIE'

<P>
The production of Tennessee Williams' "The Glass Menagerie" that opened at the 
Cabrillo Playhouse last Thursday was marred by fundamental problems in the 
acting and pacing. 
</P>
<P>
Although director Tom Amen, who also co-produced the show in cooperation with 
the San Clemente Community Theater, did bring an unindulgent approach to this 
emotionally arch play, he had trouble presenting the characters and their story 
in an effective way. This opening night too often felt like a dress rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
The 1944 drama, probably Williams' most sentimental because of its 
autobiographical roots, requires a steady passion throughout: Go too far and it 
veers toward the bathetic; fail to evoke the right tension and you risk losing 
much the poignancy of its humanity. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly demonstrating the nature of the characters and their ties to each other 
is crucial, and that wasn't always accomplished by Amen and his performers. 
When Tom (Buck Stevens) and mother Amanda (Flora Burke) fight, it has to be 
more than bickering. Their sad battles are the documentation of a 
disintegrating family, a reality that didn't often emerge in this production. 
</P>
<P>
For her part, Burke had problems with the lines, occasionally stumbling over or 
misquoting them. Probably just opening-night nerves, but it affected the drama. 
As much as any playwright, Williams' poetic language must be handled precisely 
or the mood is easily shattered. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens was strong during the narrations, when Tom sets the tone and describes 
the dynamics of the day and within his desperate family. But his interactions 
with the other characters lacked forcefulness -- his key fight with Amanda in 
the first act was more comic than it should be. 
</P>
<P>
As Laura, the handicapped sister who tends to her menagerie of glass figurines 
and waits for a "gentleman caller" (Tom Amen), Sonya Sweeney was able to show 
the heartbreaking aloneness of the character, no small accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
The production's flaws did not reach into the technical side. Although crowded, 
Amen and Stevens' set had the right look of faded living, and their lighting 
was delicate and precise. 
</P>

<P>
Hundreds of thousands of coal miners laid down their drills and picks today to 
demand that the Communist Party get out of their lives and the Soviet 
government resign. 
</P>
<P>
"We should kick the party not only out of the Ukraine, but everywhere," mine 
construction worker Viktor Kitenko declared, speaking at a rally in Donetsk, 
the center of the eastern Ukraine's Don River coal basin. 
</P>
<P>
Miners walked away from their jobs for 24 hours despite appeals from the Soviet 
government and party. 
</P>
<P>
In Donetsk, a rally passed a resolution demanding that the government of Prime 
Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov resign, that party cells be removed from mines, 
economic enterprises, the KGB, army and police, and that party property be 
nationalized. 
</P>
<P>
The miners held aloft two large banners saying: "U.S.S.R. Government Resign!" 
and "Down with Party Committees at Businesses." 
</P>
<P>
The walkout was a repetition of a long and bitter strike coal miners conducted 
last summer to press the government for better supplies of basic consumer 
goods, better pay and working conditions. The government acceded to their 
demands but has been unable to fulfill its promises. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, miners' demands have become increasingly political. 
</P>
<P>
According to information compiled from strike leaders in Donetsk, the Kuznets 
Basin of western Siberia and Vorkuta in the far north, miners at about 200 
shafts were on strike throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
No figures were available on the number of miners who walked off their jobs. 
But judging from the number of mines on strike in the Donetsk region, it 
appeared that about 100,000 miners stayed away. Strike organizers claimed that 
about 300,000 miners would halt work in western Siberia alone. 
</P>
<P>
Andrei Slivka of the Donetsk Workers Strike Committee said 141 mines, slightly 
more than half the region's total, were on strike. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet government newspaper Izvestia reported scattered participation 
elsewhere. Miners in the Novosibirsk region of Siberia and in Uzbekistan did 
not go along with the strike, but miners in the far east struck for the first 
time, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told the Communist Party's 28th congress 
in Moscow that the strike was not of a general nature. 
</P>
<P>
He said participation in western Siberia was minimal. "We feel more 
understanding from the side of the miners," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the mood was angry among the several thousand people who gathered in the 
hot sun in front of Communist Party and government headquarters in Donetsk to 
voice their grievances. 
</P>
<P>
One woman screamed: "Let them give back the 9-10 billion rubles they stole from 
our work!" 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear exactly what she was referring to, but the party last week set 
a value on its property at 4.9 billion rubles, $8.2 billion at the official 
exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
One widow of a miner who died of black lung disease, a black scarf around her 
head and her voice cracking, addressed the crowd. "Miners, you all have these 
lungs," she said. "You breathe what no human being should breathe."

<P>
A 20-year-old man was shot to death in an Anaheim apartment by three intruders, 
authorities said today. 
</P>
<P>
Officers found the man, whose identity was not confirmed, lying on the living 
room floor of the apartment with a single gunshot wound to his chest, said 
Anaheim Police Officer John Oldroyd. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics pronounced the man dead at the scene, Oldroyd said. 
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred about 9:20 p.m. Tuesday in an apartment on East Banyan 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
The man was with two friends when three intruders entered an open front door, 
brandishing a knife, handgun and rifle, Oldroyd said. The invaders ordered the 
victim's two friends to go to a back room and remain there. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, the friends told police, they heard a single gunshot, 
Oldroyd said. They waited a few minutes, then went into the living room and 
found the victim lying on the floor. The three intruders had fled. 
</P>
<P>
It was not apparent whether anything had been taken from the apartment, Oldroyd 
said. Investigators were unsure whether the shooting was drug- or gang-related, 
he said.

SUMMIT ENDS IN COMPROMISE; 
</P>
<P>
DISPUTE ON FARM TRADE RESOLVED

<P>
The world's richest democracies wrapped up their annual summit today, setting 
conditions for sending "meaningful and sustained" financial aid to the Soviet 
Union and agreeing to reduce worldwide agricultural subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
The last-minute trade compromise finessed a nasty dispute over farm subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
The summit urged that Western technical assistance be dispatched immediately to 
help Moscow "mobilize its own resources," and the leaders ordered a study to 
recommend ways to target future aid. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, in a wrap-up news conference, said the moves on Soviet aid were 
"an effort to encourage forward motion and be helpful." Bush said he would 
brief Mikhail S. Gorbachev on the summit results and had already sent a 
preliminary cable. 
</P>
<P>
In a final communique, the seven leaders called on the Soviet Union to "shift 
resources substantially away from the military sector" and to "quit support" 
for satellite states and nations involved in regional conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe this can lead" to direct cash support from the United States, he said. 
But, Bush said, "I'm not enthusiastic about the intercontinental ballistic 
missiles aimed at U.S. cities," and he said he found $5 billion a year in 
Soviet aid to Cuba "a little contradictory." 
</P>
<P>
Others were ready to move ahead. "We are on the front line as Europeans and 
maybe we can help the United States understand why we want to help the Soviet 
Union," Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti said. "When someone is ill, you 
don't want to wait for medicine." 
</P>
<P>
Satisfied with their 11th-hour compromises on farm subsidies and the 
environment, the leaders quickly concluded their 16th annual summit this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a summit that addressed itself to a rapidly changing world," Bush 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Trade negotiators reached a compromise agricultural agreement in the early 
hours today, and the seven heads of government spent just half an hour 
reviewing the document before giving their approval at their final session at 
Rice University. 
</P>
<P>
The United States insisted on language calling for across-the-board cuts in all 
categories of farm subsidies. But the agreement also contained ambiguous 
language acceptable to the reluctant Europeans, urging each nation "to make 
substantial, progressive reductions." 
</P>
<P>
The farm dispute had threatened to disrupt the annual gathering. 
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd acknowledged that there had been some 
hard words. "But it will be a more successful summit than if everybody had come 
here determined to sing from the beginning a unified hymn of praise." 
</P>
<P>
In a self-congratulatory final communique, the world leaders patted themselves 
on the back for a global economy that was still chugging along, although at a 
decidedly slow pace. 
</P>
<P>
The communique also agreed to a pilot study to help save the Amazon rain 
forests, but in a victory for the Administration, did not press for specific 
reduction targets for the pollutants suspected of causing a global warming of 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The final communique basically recycled many of the environmental pledges made 
by the same countries at last year's summit session in Paris.

Democratic Chairman Ronald H. Brown made it official today -- the party's 1992 
national convention will be held in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
"Democrats will nominate the next President of the United States two years from 
. . . this week in America's most dynamic city and in one of the world's 
greatest cities -- New York, the Big Apple," Brown said in announcing the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
Brown also said he is considering several format changes for the convention, 
including possibly cutting the event from four days to three and holding it on 
the weekend instead of midweek. 
</P>
<P>
New York officials believe the convention will pump $100 million into the 
city's economy, and landing the event is a plum for Mayor David N. Dinkins, who 
lobbied aggressively for more than a year to persuade Brown to bring the party 
to New York, which hosted Democratic conventions in 1976 and 1980.

The battle began early in the morning after about 100 riot-equipped Quebec 
police officers stormed an illegal barricade set up by the Mohawks on a hilltop 
just outside Oka, a small town 20 miles west of Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Cpl. Marcel Lemay, 31, was pronounced dead a short time later at a Montreal

Novelist A. N. Wilson has violated one of the sternest rules governing 
treatment of British royalty -- reporting a dinner table chat with the Queen 
Mum in which she recalls giggling at T. S. Eliot reading "The Waste Land" and 
can't remember the name of either the poet or the poem. 
</P>
<P>
The conversation with Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother and Wilson 
took place nearly a decade ago and was recounted by Wilson in the weekly 
Spectator magazine. 
</P>
<P>
In the conversation, reproduced in dialogue form, the mother of Queen Elizabeth 
II and widow of King George VI was said to have revealed a fondness for 
detective stories and a problem with her cash flow: "Had such an awful 
afternoon today with my bank manager, scolding me about my overdraft." 
</P>
<P>
After a few remarks about politics came this gem of an account of a poetry 
evening at Windsor Castle during World War II, at which T. S. Eliot recited 
"The Waste Land." 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth: "We had this rather lugubrious man in a suit, and he read a poem. . 
. . I think it was called 'The Desert.' And first the girls got the giggles, 
and then I did and then even the King." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson: " 'The Desert,' ma'am? Are you sure it wasn't called 'The Waste Land?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth: "That's it. I'm afraid we all giggled. Such a gloomy man, looked as 
though he worked in a bank, and we didn't understand a word." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson: "I believe he DID once work in a bank." 
</P>
<P>
The article, published in the midst of national celebrations of the queen 
mother's 90th birthday, was thoughtful and affectionate but drew a flurry of 
outrage. 
</P>
<P>
"Scoundrel!" thundered Lord Wyatt of Weeford. Lord Wyatt, a former journalist, 
was host of the dinner. He called it a "deceitfully obtained and stolen 
'interview.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nicholas Soames, member of Parliament and scion of the Churchill family, called 
it "an intolerable betrayal," "an appalling want of chivalry" and "an 
absolutely fundamental breach of trust." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, 39, clearly knew he was courting trouble. As a preface to the article, 
the first in a series of interviews, he wrote: 
</P>
<P>
"It is probably the grossest impropriety to embarrass her, or her host, by 
repeating our conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"I do so, however, without very much compunction, since she never gives 
'interviews,' and I can think of no better person than Queen Elizabeth with 
whom to start off an occasional series of conversations with men and women who 
have lived through most of the years of this century . . . and whose memories 
stretch back far."

</P>
<P>
Warning against half-measures in Eastern Europe, IMF Managing Director Michel 
Camdessus stressed that market reform programs must be introduced as rapidly as 
possible and must be as general as possible for them to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't take a little liberalization of prices, a little autonomy of 
enterprises . . . a little less state regulation, because that doesn't work," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the need for a "social safety net" to cushion the impact of 
the reforms on vulnerable sectors of the population. 
</P>
<P>
"The passage to a market economy does not create poverty, but it reveals it," 
he said. "The characteristics of a centralized economy are unemployment and 
inflation in waiting. When you liberalize prices . . . these increase."

<P>
The stock market swept ahead to a 3 1/2-week high today, rebounding from 
Tuesday's setback. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen 23.27 points on 
Tuesday, climbed 41.83 points to 2,932.67, its highest close since it stood at 
a record 2,935.89 on June 15. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 2 to 1 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, with 969 up, 498 down and 517 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 162.22 million shares, against 147.63 million in the 
previous session. 
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index gained 2.35 to 197.11. 
</P>
<P>
The advance picked up momentum as the session progressed, propelled by 
computer-program buying from professional traders engaged in multiple 
strategies involving stock-index options and futures. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said stocks also seemed to benefit from a slight decline in 
open-market interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of long-term government bonds edged upward in the credit markets, 
putting their yields in the 8.55%-8.60% range. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps the biggest plus, brokers said, was the market's steady showing of 
late in the face of a succession of disappointments as companies begin to make 
their earnings reports for the second quarter of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices headed higher at midday today, reflecting the success of Tuesday's 
auction of savings and loan bailout bonds by the Resolution Funding Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's key 30-year bond was up 1/2 point, or $5.00 per $1,000 face 
amount. Its yield, which falls when prices rise, was down to 8.52% from 8.57% 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Prices of shorter-term issues also rose. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices had been falling since last Thursday, with traders concerned about 
the market's ability to absorb new government securities up for auction and 
slim prospects for lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
But the market perked up today, analysts said, after Tuesday's auction, in 
which Refcorp, the agency set up to help finance the thrift bailout, sold 
$5-billion worth of 30-year bonds at an average yield of 8.93%. 
</P>
<P>
Refcorp received bids totaling $15.5 billion, or more than $3 in bids for every 
$1 in bonds sold. Demand was stronger than in two earlier sales of 40-year 
bailout bonds. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the Refcorp auction went well," said Carl Napolitano, market 
strategist at R. C. Government Securities. 
</P>
<P>
But traders were keeping their eyes on another new issue this afternoon -- the 
sale of $8 billion in seven-year notes. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the market will also take cues later this week from two economic 
indicators due for release on Friday: June retail sales and the June producer 
price index. 
</P>
<P>
By midday in the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term 
governments gained 3/32 point, intermediate maturities rose by 5/32 point to 
11/32 point and long-term issues rose as much as 1/2 point, according to 
Telerate Inc.

SUIT AGAINST SON IN HANDS OF REGULATOR BUSH DISLIKES

<P>
If President Bush's son Neil is sued by the federal government over his 
involvement in the collapse of a Denver savings and loan, his fate could be in 
the hands of a government regulator who has often clashed with the President. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials confirmed today that a $200-million federal lawsuit may be 
brought against Bush and eight other former members of the board of Silverado 
Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Assn., which collapsed in 1988 at a cost to 
taxpayers of about $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The suit would accuse the nine board members of negligence in the failure of 
the Colorado thrift and could be one of the biggest ever brought by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
"The matter is still under consideration, but it's not uncommon to bring these 
kinds of suits after an institution fails," said FDIC spokesman Alan Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
The decision on whether to file the suit -- which could be a huge political 
embarrassment for the President -- lies with FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman. 
President Bush has made it clear that he does not care for Seidman and has 
strongly hinted that he would like him to leave, although he has no power to 
remove him before his term expires in October. 
</P>
<P>
"Seidman has not decided when he will make that decision," Whitney said of 
possible legal action, adding that any suit would likely be filed in Denver 
federal court and could be a lengthy operation. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if regulators were unfairly focusing on 34-year-old Neil Bush 
because of his high-profile father, Whitney said, "I can assure you that's not 
true." 
</P>
<P>
The collapse of Silverado is just one of hundreds in the S &amp; L industry, 
whose bailout is expected to cost taxpayers $300 billion over the next 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney would not confirm press reports that the civil suit would seek $200 
million in damages but said if that is the price tag, it would be one of the 
FDIC's largest. 
</P>
<P>
Clashes between Seidman -- who is well-regarded in Congress and the banking 
industry -- and the Administration have prompted unusual efforts by the 
President to oust the regulator from his increasingly important post, banking 
sources say. 
</P>
<P>
But Whitney denied there is tension between the two: "That is flatly untrue. 
They have a very good relationship."

Rock star Madonna's "Blond Ambition" tour arrived in Italy to a 
less-than-sellout crowd after weeks of protests against her by Roman Catholic 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
And she canceled a second planned performance in Rome because of low ticket 
sales and a threatened general strike by labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
The show has angered the church and pro-family groups that object to the 
lingerie-clad Madonna using a crucifix and other Christian symbols during her 
sexually suggestive performance. 
</P>
<P>
Madonna, an Italian-American, tried to win over the concert crowd Tuesday night 
by donning the No. 15 jersey of Italian soccer star Roberto Baggio and by 
occasionally speaking Italian during the show. 
</P>
<P>
Scalpers sold tickets at cost or less. Police estimate there were 30,000 people 
at Flaminio stadium, which has a capacity of 32,000. "The controversy has 
gravely damaged the take," said David Zard, Madonna's promoter in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
The state-run RAI television network dropped plans to record the concert for 
future broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
"My blood boils when I am misunderstood and judged unfairly for my 
convictions," Madonna said before the concert.

BRADLEY JOINS PROTEST OF NEA GRANT REJECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying rejection of National Endowment for the Arts grants to four performance 
artists "amounts to an obscenity," Mayor Tom Bradley joined a national protest 
today demanding formal appeals in the case -- which has become a major 
escalation in the NEA political crisis. 
</P>
<P>
At the morning press conference, Bradley also announced winners of more than $3 
million in city cultural grants -- a list that included several artists and 
arts organizations caught up in the NEA controversy. 
</P>
<P>
Similar press conferences were held simultaneously in Seattle and New York, at 
which local city officials and artists attempted to turn up the heat on NEA 
Chairman John E. Frohnmayer for rejecting the four grants in an attempt to 
appease the endowment's conservative critics. 
</P>
<P>
At the NEA in Washington, a spokeswoman said there would be no statement on the 
situation from Frohnmayer, who has been unavailable since he announced 
rejection of the four grants. 
</P>
<P>
The endowment has given no reason for the fellowship rejections, insisting that 
internal NEA policies preclude such public explanations. However, most 
observers believe that Frohnmayer denied the grants to quell a political furor 
created by conservatives angered over the sometimes explicit and politically 
charged content of the work of the four artists involved. 
</P>
<P>
Flanking Bradley during the announcements were performance artists Tim Miller 
and John Fleck, who were among the four grantees rejected nearly two weeks ago. 
Fleck and Miller, along with New York performers Karen Finley and Holly Hughes, 
jointly announced the filing of appeals with the NEA. 
</P>
<P>
The City Hall press conference was also attended by famed choreographer Bella 
Lewitzky, who recently turned down $72,000 in NEA funding because she refused 
to sign an anti-obscenity certification required of all endowment grantees this 
year. The city grant announcement issued by Bradley showed that Lewitzky 
received $27,000. 
</P>
<P>
The city grant list also included a $2,555 award to artist Cheri Gaulke, who 
was recently targeted in an investigation by the U.S. General Accounting Office 
demanded by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), the NEA's most visible political 
opponent. Helms demanded that the GAO obtain the dates when Gaulke and several 
other artists showed work or performed at two New York City arts spaces over a 
six-year period.

The fire that destroyed the landmark Gilley's country-western nightclub has

Pasadena Fire Marshal Bill Yearout declined to reveal how or where Thursday's 
fire broke out. He said arson investigators have several leads and don't want 
to release details while the investigation continues. 
</P>
<P>
Gilley's had been closed since March 1989 because of a legal dispute between 
country-western singer Mickey Gilley and his one-time partner in the nightclub, 
Sherwood Cryer.

Fire officials say souvenir hunters are taking pieces from the ruins of the

CLAY TEARFULLY DEFENDS HIS COMIC STYLE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A defiant Andrew Dice Clay shrugged off criticism that his comedy is racist and 
sexist, tearfully telling Arsenio Hall's audience that his foul-mouthed routine 
is a deep expression of belief in himself. 
</P>
<P>
Clay appeared on "The Arsenio Hall Show" Tuesday night to promote his new film, 
"The Adventures of Ford Fairlane." 
</P>
<P>
He faced a walkout by a member of the syndicated television talk show's band 
and blunt questions from Hall about his brand of shock-comic routine. 
</P>
<P>
Keyboardist Starr Parodi said she exercised her right to disagree with Clay's 
humor by not performing during the show. Clay shrugged off the boycott, saying 
"People do what they got to do." 
</P>
<P>
Then, squaring his shoulders like Elvis Presley, Clay suddenly broke into tears 
as he faced the studio audience. 
</P>
<P>
He said his routine is the product of long, hard work to discover what is funny 
and true. 
</P>
<P>
"I broke my ass for 12 years . . . and tomorrow, when they go to see that 
movie, they're all going to laugh," he declared, his voice cracking with 
emotion. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to be a doctor, or if you want to be a lawyer, you don't listen to 
nobody and you believe in yourself. That's what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
Clay is known for expletive-laden routines that contain vulgar references to 
women, homosexuals and minorities. But he said he is misunderstood by critics, 
including many fellow entertainers, who say his brand of humor is offensive and 
hateful. 
</P>
<P>
He said his ethnic put-down style is "just a joke." 
</P>
<P>
"This is the greatest country in the world," he added. "We let everybody in, 
and that gives me more comedic material."

Kirk Douglas was downplaying his movie hero image and talking about his new 
book when a fire alarm created some live-action adventure. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas was in the middle of a newspaper interview last week when an intercom 
in his 16th-floor hotel suite came alive. 
</P>
<P>
"Remain calm and stay where you are," came the repeated warning over the 
intercom. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," Douglas told his interviewer from the Chicago Tribune. "Remain calm. 
The ladders are outside the windows, don't look down." 
</P>
<P>
It turned out to be a false alarm. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't plan this drama, you know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, 73, was in town to plug his first novel, "Dance With the Devil." The 
actor's autobiography, "The Ragman's Son," was made into a movie, and Douglas

PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT: Chris Evert and husband Andy Mill, who according to 
Wimbledon tongue waggers, are expecting a little racqueteer before the year 
ends. . . . Popular British playwright ("Noises Off") Michael Frayn's new one, 
"Look, Look," had to be looked at very quickly indeed. It lasted a fast four 
weeks in London's West End. . . . Director Ingmar Bergman's daughter, Anna, who 
has been engaged five times in the past 11 years, says she plans to throw 
caution to the wind and wed London accountant Douglas Allen in August. We'll 
see. . . . In Las Vegas, they are wondering where Frank Sinatra will perform 
after he leaves Bally's in September. Sinatra never stays at one watering hole 
too long. The smart money bets Ole Blue Eyes will appear next at the Riviera. . 
. . Mickey Rooney, penning his memoirs for Random House, is writing without the 
aid of a ghost. The Mick says he's tired of movie stars coming out with books 
they really didn't write. . . . Paul McCartney, now in the midst of a 
tremendously successful tour, tells friends he wants to take it easy after this 
grind is all over and sail around the world with wife Linda for a couple of 
years! Well, Paul can afford it. He's the wealthiest ex-Mop Top.

NASTASSJA KINSKI is NOT getting a divorce, and she is NOT pregnant. That's what

OSCAR-WINNING composer John Barry ("Born Free," "A Lion In Winter," "Out of

AVA GARDNER and Barbara Stanwyck died within five days of each other early this 
year -- two of the great and, to our mind, often underrated ladies of the 
screen. Stanwyck seemed always to trail Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in the 
public consciousness, though her talent and versatility were equal. Gardner's 
beauty and her high-velocity private life were so overwhelming that critics 
were often blinded to her genuine ability. 
</P>
<P>
Now these wrongs have been redressed somewhat in the current issue of Film 
Comment, which contains an extraordinarily perceptive tribute to Ava and 
Barbara titled "Farewell My Lovelies" by Kathleen Murphy. This is must reading 
for fans.

PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: FIRST THINGS FIRST MAKE FOR A COMPLETE FIRST AID KIT

<P>
Summer vacations are supposed to be fun. But if you haven't taken stock of your 
medicine chest or first aid kit lately, you may be in for a nasty surprise. 
</P>
<P>
What should a family first aid kit or home medical chest contain? For the sorts 
of cuts and scratches children tend to collect, adhesive bandages in a wide 
variety of sizes and shapes are essential. 
</P>
<P>
Bigger scrapes may call for non-stick gauze pads and adhesive tape, as well as 
a blunt scissor for cutting tape so you don't have to tear it. A new product 
called 2nd Skin goes on right over a blister or minor burn to protect it as 
well as keep it comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
Don't mess with iodine or alcohol. Most scratches and scrapes do just fine with 
a little soap and water for cleaning. (If you're carting your first aid kit to 
out-of-the-way places, a small container of liquid soap and a few cotton balls 
can be of use.) 
</P>
<P>
A little dab of Polysporin or other non-prescription antibiotic ointment helps 
prevent infection. 
</P>
<P>
Soap and water can also come in handy if someone gets into poison ivy or poison 
oak accidentally. Washing thoroughly within five minutes of contact is the best 
way to avoid a rash. A premoistened alcohol wipe will also work if water is 
scarce. 
</P>
<P>
Sprains call for a cold pack and a compression bandage. Modern cold packs such 
as Ace Instant Cold Compress, Jack Frost Instant Cold Pack, or 3M's Cold

An over-the-counter pain reliever (aspirin, acetaminophen or ibuprofen) and an 
anti-itch cream are also essential.

Professional tweezers for removing splinters, stingers, thorns and the like are 
hard to come by but well worth the investment.

With a little planning, summer accidents shouldn't have to spoil your fun.

Olympic ice dancer Jayne Torvill said today she's engaged to American sound 
engineer Phil Christensen, who is touring with pop star Phil Collins. 
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old skater said she met 35-year-old Christensen when he worked on 
the Torvill and Dean ice show tour of the United States last year. 
</P>
<P>
But she said their romance didn't begin until January when he asked her for a 
date -- at a hamburger restaurant. Three months later, he gave her a diamond 
engagement ring. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very, very happy," she told reporters here, where the ice show is on tour. 
Torvill said work commitments mean they cannot yet set a wedding date. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen, from Chicago, is on tour until October with Collins; the Torvill 
and Dean tour doesn't end until September. 
</P>
<P>
Torvill and skating partner Christopher Dean won a gold medal in the 1984 
Olympics and went on to perform their ice dance routines all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
The engagement ended years of speculation over Torvill's relationship with 
Dean, who told reporters he was overjoyed at her engagement.

TEAMMATE PENSEC SEEMS ASSURED OF BEATING LEMOND IN TOUR DE FRANCE

Defending champion Greg LeMond virtually conceded defeat in this year's Tour de 
France after being edged at the line today by Gianni Bugno of Italy in a 
dramatic sprint finish at the end of the toughest mountain stage of the cycle 
race. 
</P>
<P>
Race leader Ronan Pensec of France, a member of LeMond's "Z" team, came in 10th 
in the 114-mile 11th stage from St. Gervais but limited the gap to just 48 
seconds as he retained the yellow jersey and took a giant step toward overall 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond needed to make big inroads into an almost 10-minute deficit on Pensec. 
Though the American two-time champion moved up to third overall, his French 
teammate still leads him by nine minutes four seconds, a margin that appears 
too vast to make up in the last 10 stages. 
</P>
<P>
"It was disappointing not to win today, but it was important to be among the 
top riders in a stage like that," Lemond said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very surprised by Pensec. I didn't think he would be so close. I will 
just be helping him win the tour from now on. I'm the back-up if things go 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The hopes of other race favorites such as Steve Bauer of Canada and Raul Alcala 
of Mexico were also shattered as riders wilted in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
It looks like a two-horse race between Pensec and Claudio Chiapucci of Italy, 
second and just one minute 28 seconds behind although he fell 38 precious 
seconds farther behind. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he had won the tour in today's stage, Pensec replied: "Maybe. But 
there's still the time trial tomorrow. After that we will see." 
</P>
<P>
The drama on the 21 hairpin bends that lead up to the mountaintop finish in the 
ski resort was as spellbinding as ever in a stage that has become an annual 
tour classic. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond, who came close to a tumble as he scraped the railings on the final 
bend, nosed in front in a sprint finish between five riders but Bugno squeezed 
past right on the line. 
</P>
<P>
"The tour is never finished, and anything can always happen," Bugno said. "But 
the two leaders are so far ahead, they will both have to collapse to let anyone 
else in."

MCKEON RESIGNS AS MANAGER OF PADRES; JOB GOES TO RIDDOCH

<P>
Jack McKeon resigned as manager of the San Diego Padres to turn his attention 
to the front office and the club today named Coach Greg Riddoch to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
McKeon, who recently said he planned to step down as manager at the end of the 
season, remains with the Padres as vice president of baseball operations. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt two jobs was too much. I was really getting burdened," McKeon said 
at a news conference today. "I know the club has been an underachieving club. 
We expected a great deal out of the players. Maybe it's my fault. I take full 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just a case where I was wore out. I didn't have the time to devote to 
both jobs. I was cheating the organization. I was cheating myself." 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch, in his fourth season with the Padres, will be managing in the major 
leagues for the first time. The 44-year-old Riddoch previously had minor league 
managerial jobs at Seattle, Billings, Mont., and Eugene, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
"I have signed a new contract through the end of the year," Riddoch said. "I'm 
the manager, not an interim manager. I'm going to make it as hard as I can for 
them to get rid of me." 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch got right into his job when he said that batting coach Amos Otis was 
fired and two new coaches would be joining the team. He declined to name them. 
</P>
<P>
The Padres are struggling at 37-43 and lost 12 of 15 games before the All-Star 
break, including eight games of a 10-game home stand. They start the second 
half of the season in fourth place in the National League West, 13 1/2 games 
behind Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Riddoch isn't worried about catching the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
"They are 12 to 14 games ahead of us and to look at that type of goal would be 
counterproductive for us," he said. "It's time for us to refocus together, as a 
team, as people with more feelings about each other and once we establish that 
we can go out on the field and play baseball like we did when we were kids."

A West German newspaper said today the United States will back out of its 
commitment to hold the 1994 World Cup soccer tournament, but an official of the 
U.S. organizing committee and a spokesman for a major sponsor deny the charge. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States this year will give up the 1994 World Championships," wrote 
Bild columnist Paul Breitner, a former West German soccer player. 
</P>
<P>
He said that two of the major American sponsors are backing out because there 
is not enough interest in soccer in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But Ross Berlin, vice president for venues for the 1994 World Cup Organizing 
Committee, told the Associated Press that the report "is ridiculous, and not 
worthy of comment." 
</P>
<P>
And Randy Donaldson, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in Atlanta, told the AP, "It is 
absolutely untrue that Coca-Cola is trying to pull out of its support for World 
Cup '94." 
</P>
<P>
Breitner said low television ratings during the just-finished World Cup 
convinced American sponsors that the tournament will not be a success in the 
United States.

</P>
<P>
Agenor, unseeded in this tournament, is ranked 45th in the world; Gomez is

ALMAHURST FARM, HORSE RACING LEADER, PLACED ON MARKET

Almahurst Farm, which produced 1918 Kentucky Derby winner Exterminator and 
numerous harness racing champions, has been put on the market for $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 884-acre farm, five miles south of Lexington in Jessamine County, is owned 
by P. J. Baugh. 
</P>
<P>
He cited his health, estate planning and a decline in the standardbred industry 
as the reasons for selling the historic farm. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's the toughest decision I ever had to make in my life," said Baugh, 
58, who bought Almahurst in 1963 and developed it into one of the industry's 
leading farms. 
</P>
<P>
"We put our heart and soul and assets in it." 
</P>
<P>
Baugh said a heart attack he had in October and his children's lack of interest 
in running the farm made him reconsider whether he should keep it. 
</P>
<P>
He began cutting back last year, selling mares owned in partnership and moving 
Almahurst stallions to New Jersey and elsewhere in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
The farm, which will be offered worldwide by Ledbetter and Stewart Ltd., has 
barns for stallions, mares and yearlings, seven houses, an original log cabin, 
offices and a maintenance shop.

CRAIG'S PLANS TO GET EVEN WITH LA RUSSA DROWN IN CHICAGO

<P>
The last time these two tangled with something at stake, the Earth moved. This 
meeting produced nothing more spectacular than an hourlong shower, so it should 
come as little surprise that Roger Craig feels cheated. 
</P>
<P>
Again. 
</P>
<P>
And he is only the first at the end of a very long line. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Fay Vincent, still shy of a year on the job, saw his first World 
Series humbled by nature last fall and now his first All-Star game numbed by 
boredom. Worse yet, he missed a foul pop-up by inches. 
</P>
<P>
But at least he got in for free. CBS paid enough for the telecast to kick-start 
the economy of a small corner of Eastern Europe, and all the ratings numbers 
they likely will receive in return wouldn't buy more than a few pebbles from 
the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
And if there was any doubt that the network knew it was surrendering its 
audience by the minute, consider that the show it cut to during the rain delay 
-- appropriately, "Rescue 911" -- was a rerun. 
</P>
<P>
Even those losses, however, were of little solace to the fans inside the 
ballpark. They ponied up anywhere from $40 (face value) to a rumored $1,500 
(scalper's value) and didn't get the opportunity to see comedian Bill Murray 
serenade the rest of the nation. At least that was funny. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there was no doubt who drew the shortest straw. 
</P>
<P>
Craig blew into the Windy City around 3 a.m. Monday and made it clear before he 
sat down to lunch that he was gunning for Tony La Russa. And Tuesday night, he 
played more hunches than a mother of six on a roll during Las Vegas night at 
the neighborhood church, used four more players than his counterpart, violated 
All-Star Game protocol by ordering two intentional walks, gave it one hell of 
an effort -- and still lost to La Russa. 
</P>
<P>
Again. 
</P>
<P>
"I told my players I expect them to play like this was the last game of the 
World Series," Craig said, "because I intended to manage it that way." 
</P>
<P>
That was the first mistake. After Craig's Giants lost everything from the 
earthquake-delayed World Series last fall to a handful of exhibition games this 
spring to La Russa's Athletics, he figured he had a break coming. 
</P>
<P>
That was the second mistake. The way things turned out, American League Manager 
La Russa got more hits from his guys in one inning than National League Manager 
Craig got from his throughout the long, wet evening, though he was smart enough 
not to claim credit for a less-than-artistic success. 
</P>
<P>
What passed for offense in the Friendly Confines on Tuesday night was pretty 
much confined to the seventh. Cleveland's Sandy Alomar led it off against San 
Francisco's Jeff Brantley by topping a ball that crawled into the hole at 
shortstop and arrived safely at first on the seat of his pants. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Parrish followed by slicing a drive into right that landed just in time 
to beat the rain, which then landed all over Wrigley for the next hour and 
eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Craig did a lot of thinking during that time and had resolved to leave Brantley 
in the game. But all that ruminating went for naught when the muscles around 
Brantley's rib cage, made sore from nothing more serious than bouts of tossing 
and turning the last few nights, stiffened to the point where he had decided to 
work no more. 
</P>
<P>
"He would have continued to pitch because he's one of the best there is at 
getting out of a situation like that," Craig said. "But the trainer said he was 
sore, and what are you going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
What Craig did was get Nasty Boy Rob Dibble from the bullpen; that was mistake 
No. 3. The Reds' right-hander brought a 4-2 record, seven saves and a 1.68 
earned-run average into the contest. But the reason he pitches middle relief 
for Lou Piniella in Cincinnati is because Dibble also has this nasty habit of 
walking into explosive situations carrying a lighted match -- and leaving 
somebody else to take the blame. 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the season, Dibble inherited 21 runners, allowed 10 to score 
and still maintained a perfect 0.00 ERA. Tuesday night, he got ahead 0-2 
against Julio Franco, then grooved a fastball that the Texan (by way of the 
Dominican Republic) drove into the right-center-field gap for a double and the 
only two runs of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's funny," Craig said, even though he obviously didn't think so. "Dibble had 
him 0-2, he's a power pitcher, and I turned to (NL coach and good friend) Don 
Zimmer and I said, 'Watch him try to throw the next one by him.' 
</P>
<P>
"I hardly got the words out of my mouth when Franco hit it." 
</P>
<P>
It is no doubt small consolation by now, but La Russa hardly outsmarted Craig. 
</P>
<P>
Again. 
</P>
<P>
La Russa, in fact, had to stifle a grin when asked afterward whether there was 
any particular strategy involved in inserting Franco into the game in the 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no strategy," he admitted. "I was just trying to get the players on my 
squad into the game. Really, you can flip a coin. All of these pitchers can 
pitch and all of the hitters can hit, and there really wasn't any strategy 
involved." 
</P>
<P>
So lighten up, Roger. The World Series might be like a chess game, and a case 
can be made for all that maneuvering in spring training to get a look at a lot 
of people. 
</P>
<P>
But as La Russa demonstrated, success in the All-Star game simply requires the 
understanding that behind every good manager are a lot of good men. Let them 
play.

<P>
With his rosy cheeks and rosette-laden lapel, Felix de Weldon -- sculptor of 
the Iwo Jima Memorial and 2,000 other public sculptures -- is, at 83, something 
of a national monument himself. 
</P>
<P>
Diminutive in stature, eyes a bright clear blue, only his disheveled 
reddish-brown toupee and white lies about age hint at vanity. Red, white and 
blue, he stands foursquare behind the flag and recently was seen on national 
television standing foursquare behind President Bush after presenting him with 
a 66th birthday present: a small bronze replica of the Iwo Jima Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
When De Weldon walked through his own latest photo opportunity, "Legends and 
Myths: Sculpture by Felix de Weldon," the first commercial gallery show for 
this master of memorial tonnage, he seemed pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks wonderful," he said, hugging a female employee of Georgetown's new 
Merrill Chase Galleries -- a large enterprise that has five outlets in Chicago. 
A representative from the home office had come to town especially to train 
employees in the art of selling the newly minted De Weldon sculptures, the 
first he has ever produced on a domestic scale for the mass market. 
</P>
<P>
Three of these works -- a classical figure of Aphrodite, a standing mother 
holding two children, and "Humanity," a negative-relief head of Christ with 
eyes that follow as you pass by -- are the real reason for the show. But they 
are, as is appropriate, set in the context of several models and photographs 
and framed citations related to De Weldon's memorials and portrait busts of 
heroes, presidents and kings. Among them, none of them for sale: 
</P>
<P>
"The Flag Raising on Iwo Jima" (more properly, the Marine Corps War Memorial) 
in Arlington; the monument to Adm. Richard E. Byrd in Antarctica; the National 
Monument for Malaysia, in Kuala Lumpur; the portrait of Eisenhower at the 
Kennedy Center's Eisenhower Theater; Harry Truman at the Truman Library; and 
John F. Kennedy at the Kennedy Library. He served on the Fine Arts Commission 
here under all three presidents. 
</P>
<P>
De Weldon has 30 works in Washington alone, ranging in size from the equestrian 
statue of Simon Bolivar near the Pan American Union to a marble copy of 
Michelangelo's "Pieta" at St. Matthew's Cathedral. The gallery has printed a 
small map for those who would like to make the Washington tour. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the Iwo Jima Memorial that catapulted De Weldon to fame, during World 
War II. An immigrant from Austria, where he was born the prodigious son of a 
wealthy textile manufacturer (killed by Soviet bombs at the end of World War 
II), De Weldon had begun bagging a large share of public commissions in Vienna 
at age 17, beating out his own art professor. After studies in Paris, Rome and 
Madrid, he headed for Oxford and London in the '30s, where he soon was engaged 
doing portraits of society's upper echelons, including British Prime Minister 
David Lloyd George and two kings named George, V and VI. 
</P>
<P>
From there he went to Canada, then to the United States, where he enlisted in 
the Navy as an aviation combat artist. He was stationed at the Patuxent Naval 
Air Station in Maryland, he recalls, when the big break came. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in the middle of painting the Battle of the Coral Sea when a wire 
service photo came into the admiral's office showing American Marines raising 
the flag over Mt. Suribachi on Iwo Jima," he says. "They came in every day, but 
this one, by Joe Rosenthal of AP, was extraordinary. It showed the unison of 
action, the forward drive, the will to sacrifice, to hold the flag high." (One 
assumes he has said these words before.) 
</P>
<P>
"That was Friday, Feb. 23, 1945," he recalled, "the same day the flag-raising 
took place. I immediately set to work on a model, working all day and all night 
for three days, and produced a wax model three feet high." His commanding 
officer, recognizing its potential importance as a symbolic rallying cry during 
that dark, bloody time (6,321 Marines lost their lives there in 35 days), sent 
De Weldon and the wax to Navy headquarters in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
That first model had been improvised: "There were no real sculpture materials, 
but there was lots of floor wax, which was too soft, and sealing wax, which was 
too hard, so I melted and combined them," De Weldon says. "The secretary of the 
treasury then asked if I could make a nine-foot-tall version for the opening of 
a war bond drive six months later. And I did." 
</P>
<P>
That plaster-and-stone version stood for three years across from the temporary 
Navy buildings, then on Constitution Avenue. Eventually, it was moved to 
Quantico -- apparently by a Lt. John Warner, now the U.S. senator. At Quantico, 
De Weldon carved another, more permanent version from Indiana limestone. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, De Weldon had been mustered out of the service and -- by a 
joint resolution of Congress -- commissioned to produce the 78-foot-high 
sculpture that now stands in Arlington. In a rented 18th-Century studio on 
Capitol Hill, where the pediment of the U.S. Capitol had been carved by Paul W. 
Bartlett, De Weldon set to work on the project with a crew of riggers, welders, 
carpenters and plasterers. It took six years. 
</P>
<P>
Though he had received only his Navy pay until then, he was promised $600,000 
to complete the work, including all costs of building the model in plaster and 
casting it in bronze. (The total, including pedestal, was $850,000 according to 
reports at the time, $1.2 million according to De Weldon.) The money was 
quickly raised by subscription through the Marine Corps War Memorial Fund. 
"Each Marine had to give $1, and there were 600,000 Marines, so it was done in 
two years." 
</P>
<P>
"It cost more than I got," says De Weldon, who claims he financed the statue 
from 1946 to 1952, when he received the first payment. "As the years went on, 
we had quite a struggle to finance it. It was cast in New York, and the cost 
was enormous." 
</P>
<P>
The 100-ton bronze, cast in Brooklyn, was finally dedicated on Nov. 10, 1954, 
and De Weldon -- along with millions of others who still remember those dark 
days -- has been reaping its rewards ever since. 
</P>
<P>
Asked politely whether the Iwo Jima Memorial was not, in fact, a monument to a 
photograph, he replies, "Not at all. The photograph has one side. My sculpture 
has four sides. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't work from the photograph," he says. "It just gave me the inspiration, 
but I didn't copy it. You only see four men in the photograph -- there were 
actually six. Only the first man is the same as in my monument -- the one who 
pushes the flagpole into the ground. That pole was a Japanese lead water pipe, 
and extremely heavy, and that's what made it so effective -- they really had to 
push hard." 
</P>
<P>
De Weldon also used combat film to help work out his design, which he 
intensified, he says, into a pyramidal composition. 
</P>
<P>
The flag, by the way, became a real flag only after the bronze one on the 
mid-size model got blown out of shape in the wind, "just like spaghetti," 
according to De Weldon. As for the controversial question of whether the 
photograph was posed -- some said the action was staged a second time because 
photographers weren't present when it actually happened -- De Weldon says 
absolutely not. "They raised a small flag that morning," he says, but the 
troops on the beach couldn't see it. "One of the Marines got a larger flag from 
a destroyer, and when they put that up, the picture was taken." 
</P>
<P>
"It's my design -- I can have it reproduced," says De Weldon of the small new 
version he made as a gift to President Bush. "I own the copyright combined with 
the Franklin Mint. If they make more, they have to give me a royalty." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal received the Pulitzer Prize.

CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST ANNOUNCES HE'S GAY

<P>
After Marvin Liebman, one of the founders of the modern conservative movement, 
privately distributed copies of a letter a few weeks ago announcing to his 
"best friend" William F. Buckley Jr. that he was coming out of the closet, he 
received a call from Bill's older brother, Jim, inviting him to dinner. 
</P>
<P>
They went to I Ricchi and had a pleasant talk, without any mention of Liebman's 
impending public revelation. When the check came, Jim, a judge on the U.S. 
Court of Appeals in Washington and a former U.S. senator from New York whose 
campaigns had been fueled by Liebman's fund-raising expertise, paid it and then 
lifted his glass. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my way," he said with the characteristic Buckley grin, "of saluting an 
act of courage." 
</P>
<P>
"And," says Liebman, sitting in his Washington apartment the other day 
reflecting on his life, "not another word was said on the matter." 
</P>
<P>
In his moving letter -- published in the July 9 issue of William Buckley's 
National Review -- Liebman writes that "I am almost 67 years old. For more than 
half of my lifetime, I have been engaged in, and indeed helped to organize and 
maintain, the conservative and anti-Communist cause. The names of some of the 
enterprises we helped launch may bring a nostalgic tug . . . the American 
Committee for Aid to the Katanga Freedom-Fighters . . . the Committee of One 
Million . . . Young Americans for Freedom . . . the Conservative Party of New 
York . . . the Goldwater and Reagan campaigns." 
</P>
<P>
And then: "All the time I labored in the conservative vineyard, I was gay." 
</P>
<P>
The editor in chief's published response to his "brother in combat" and "dear 
friend" -- Buckley, two years younger, was his godfather when Liebman became 
Catholic a decade ago -- was more formal, although he notes his "affection and 
respect" for Liebman. He writes that he understands the "pain" that society has 
inflicted on homosexuals "sometimes unintentionally, sometimes sadistically. It 
is wholesome that we should be reproached for causing that pain." And he 
promises that National Review "will not be scarred by thoughtless gay-bashing." 
</P>
<P>
However, Buckley writes, in "the Judeo-Christian tradition" to which he 
adheres, homosexuality is considered "unnatural, whatever its etiology. . . . 
Ought considerations of charity entirely swamp us, causing us to submerge 
convictions having to do with that which we deem to be normal, and healthy?" 
</P>
<P>
Liebman chuckles at this. 
</P>
<P>
"There's very little Bill could do that would distress me," he says. "He's been 
my best and closest friend. That's just the way he is. I don't feel remotely 
put down by it. You know, he has these crazy ideas -- Judeo-Christian bull. But 
he's a nice man." 
</P>
<P>
Friday Liebman wrapped up the week's work at the Federal Trade Commission, 
where he's director of special projects, and left for Stamford for a small 
gathering of family and friends to celebrate Bill and Patricia Buckley's 40th 
wedding anniversary. Arriving back in Washington, Liebman said he and Buckley 
discussed the matter amiably and Buckley was "very cool about it; he was very 
nice." 
</P>
<P>
"Knowing Bill has absolutely changed my life," says Liebman, who was persuaded 
into the conservative camp from Marxism after meeting the young author of "God 
and Man at Yale" in New York in the early '50s. "He's been the most important 
man in my life, and Pat has been very important. It was Pat who taught me about 
finger bowls and manners and all that sort of stuff, who gave me 
sophistication." 
</P>
<P>
Buckley declined Friday to call his wife to the phone to talk with a reporter, 
saying, "I wouldn't do that. She wouldn't talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
Before Liebman came to Washington from New York in 1980 to join the Reagan 
Revolution, serving as public relations official at the National Endowment for 
the Arts and in various other posts, it was a rare weekend when he wasn't to be 
seen socializing around one of the two pools (one indoor) at the Stamford house 
with Pat and Bill and close friends, or sailing on one of Buckley's yachts. 
</P>
<P>
Yet it was never mentioned that he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important part of my life was never discussed with them, never 
verbalized," he says. "It was a secret. Now it's not a secret." 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, Liebman says, "my whole life was a lie, and it was terrible. I was 
ashamed. Life was made miserable because you were gay." 
</P>
<P>
Gay-bashing on the political right particularly pained Liebman, and in his 
letter in National Review he writes that "in many years of service to The Cause 
I've sat in rooms where people we both know -- brilliant, thoughtful, kind 
people -- have said, without any sense of shame, vulgar and cruel things about 
people who through no fault of their own happen to be different in their 
sexuality." 
</P>
<P>
His decision to come out, he writes, was motivated partly "because I fear that 
our cause might sink back into the ooze in which so much of it rested in pre-NR 
days (Buckley founded the magazine in 1955). In that dark age, the American 
Right was heavily, perhaps dominantly, made up of bigots, anti-Semites, 
anti-Catholics, the KKK, rednecks, Know Nothings, a sorry lot of public 
hucksters and religious medicine men." 
</P>
<P>
Now, Liebman writes, "too many of our friends have recently used homophobia to 
sell their newsletters, or to raise money through direct mail for their causes 
and themselves." He elaborates on these themes in an interview published in the 
July 19 issue of the Advocate, a national gay newsmagazine. 
</P>
<P>
Buckley said that he thinks Liebman's fears on this score are "terribly 
exaggerated, that the conservative movement . . . is disintegrating into a 
series of discrete plots which are anti-Catholic, antisemitic, anti-gay. The 
conservative movement is entirely wholesome. I don't see happening what he sees 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Liebman says, he deeply regrets all those decades of silence. 
</P>
<P>
"By not speaking about it," he says, "you're denying who you are, what you are. 
To let it be known that you are a different person, to be accepted as such, 
that is a great comfort, and it's so great for this new generation of gay 
people! With my generation, you killed yourself rather than be exposed." In 
coming out he's been surprised to learn, among other things, that "nobody 
really cares, so my message now for my gay friends is, 'Get out and loosen up, 
just let it all hang out.' The public is so forgiving, and really there's 
nothing to forgive. Come on out -- the air is great!' 
</P>
<P>
"The air in the closet was really sort of stultifying."

<TEXT>
<P>
In the packed committee chambers, lawmakers stared in disbelief at Rep. William 
E. Dannemeyer, the Orange County Republican with the jutting jaw and ramrod 
posture, whose views on the decline of morality in the late 20th Century have 
become legend on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
The House Energy and Commerce Committee had just announced a hard-won 
compromise on landmark clean air legislation. Dannemeyer, one of the most 
conservative members of Congress, was the first to offer an amendment. 
</P>
<P>
If Congress were going to clean up the nation's air, Dannemeyer told his 
colleagues, it ought to go a step further and clean up the nation's airwaves. 
The six-term congressman then offered language to establish "airwave emission 
standards" and $50-million penalties to ensure that television stations do not 
broadcast pornographic programs. 
</P>
<P>
Although the amendment was ruled out of order, it prompted one lobbyist to 
remark, "I hadn't seen anything as entertaining since Jim Watt," the former 
secretary of the interior. 
</P>
<P>
The exercise in political theater came as no surprise to those who have seen 
Dannemeyer take the floor of the House of Representatives to lash out at 
abortion, moral relativism, the decline of the American greenback, what he says 
is the destructive influence of pornography, what he sees as the increasing 
power of homosexual activists, what he considers the politicization of the AIDS 
epidemic, and, most recently, Nelson Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
Some call Dannemeyer a dangerous bigot. Others dismiss him as irrelevant. But 
to many conservatives, he is a genuine hero. And more than a few political 
observers who take issue with most of his views say Dannemeyer is a man driven 
by sincere religious conviction who acts as a lightning rod for debate on the 
most controversial issues of our time. 
</P>
<P>
Just last month, as Washington was warmly welcoming Nelson Mandela, the deputy 
president of the African National Congress, Dannemeyer struck again. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech on the House floor the day before Mandela addressed a rare joint 
session of Congress, Dannemeyer -- infuriating many people -- denounced the 
South African black nationalist, who was recently freed after spending 27 years 
in a South African prison, as an unrepentant terrorist and communist. 
</P>
<P>
"Nelson Mandela is no Martin Luther King," Dannemeyer said. "He is more like H. 
Rap Brown or Willie Horton." Brown was a radical of the 1960s, and Horton is a 
convicted murderer who raped a woman while on furlough from a Massachusetts 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
In a subsequent speech, Dannemeyer asked: "What is the difference between 
Nelson Mandela and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg," the Americans executed in 1953 
for passing atomic secrets to the Soviet Union? 
</P>
<P>
"Mandela pleaded guilty." 
</P>
<P>
The remarks prompted a spate of outraged letters to the editor and a scathingly 
critical column in the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his chosen role as preacher to the House, there is more to Dannemeyer 
than his rhetoric. Behind the fire and brimstone, the congressman from 
Fullerton is not the relentlessly one-dimensional caricature his critics 
sometimes paint. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer's performance before the energy committee, for example, betrayed a 
sense of humor so dry it often goes unnoticed. The "clean airwaves amendment" 
was, of course, a serious expression of his alarm over what he perceives to be 
the demise of cultural standards. 
</P>
<P>
But it also was a satirical, if deadpan, slap at the clean air bill itself, 
legislation Dannemeyer viewed as hopelessly burdensome and complicated. When 
the bill finally passed the House, Dannemeyer was one of only 21 
representatives who voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
While critics sometimes portray Dannemeyer as a bigot, one liberal Democrat 
said he has stood up for the rights of minorities. Rep. Don Edwards (D-San 
Jose), who chairs a House Judiciary subcommittee on which Dannemeyer serves, 
recalled that Dannemeyer "was very indignant about the alleged discrimination 
against minorities and women in the FBI's hiring. I was pleased. It's to Bill 
Dannemeyer's credit." 
</P>
<P>
There is one Dannemeyer quality that is evident to everyone: Those who love him 
and those who loathe him say the former prosecutor and state legislator, born 
in South Gate nearly 61 years ago, lives for a good fight. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a true believer. He's a Lutheran elder who will not shade moral issues," 
said Dannemeyer's comrade-in-arms, Rep. Robert K. Dornan of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"If (Dannemeyer) thinks something is immoral, he says it," Dornan said. "There 
are precious few people like that in the House." 
</P>
<P>
One of Dannemeyer's most severe critics -- Thomas B. Stoddard, executive 
director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, the nation's largest 
gay rights group -- put it another way: "Most politicians avoid controversy 
because controversy simply buys trouble. Controversy buys enemies. Mr. 
Dannemeyer embraces controversy." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer concedes the point. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a lawyer by profession," he said. "I'm not intimidated by the adversarial 
process. I never have been. I've made my living in litigation. I sleep nights." 
</P>
<P>
A Dannemeyer aide recalled the time his boss recounted to a group of lobbyists 
the story of how Dannemeyer, an avid fisherman, had landed a 45-pound grouper 
after a wrenching, hourlong tug of war. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the lobbyists looked up and said, 'You must have been exhausted after 
that,' " recalled Michael G. Franc, Dannemeyer's legislative counsel. "And 
(Dannemeyer) looked at him, and he smiled, and he said, 'Sir, I was 
exhilarated.' " 
</P>
<P>
Almost every public action he takes encourages the view that Dannemeyer gets a 
charge out of mixing it up with liberals who are out, in the words of one aide, 
to "ruin America." 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Dannemeyer shocked -- and apparently titillated -- many on Capitol 
Hill when he inserted into the Congressional Record, the official journal of 
congressional proceedings, a lengthy attack on the influence of homosexuals on 
federal policy. 
</P>
<P>
The most controversial passage, titled "What Homosexuals Do," recited in 
clinical detail "the average homosexual's favorite activities." The passage was 
so graphic that it prompted Rep. Andrew Jacobs Jr. (D-Ind.) to call for an 
ethics committee investigation of Dannemeyer for placing obscene material in 
the Record. The committee never took up the request. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer has written a book, published last fall, titled "Shadow in the 
Land." In it, he asserts that homosexuality "is not undeniably an inherited 
orientation, but is probably a bad habit acquired in early childhood or 
puberty." He also attacks gay rights activists for attempting the wholesale 
restructuring of American society by demanding "special rights," and says: "We 
must either defeat militant homosexuality or it will defeat us." 
</P>
<P>
And there is more to come. Dannemeyer has vowed to push for a floor vote to 
expel from Congress Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who has 
admitted placing on his personal payroll a homosexual prostitute with whom he 
once had a sexual relationship. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most liberal members of Congress, Frank also is one of two lawmakers 
who have publicly disclosed their homosexuality. (The other is Gerry Studds, 
also a Massachusetts Democrat.) The House Committee on Standards of Official 
Conduct has struggled with the Frank case for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
"Right field doesn't even begin to describe (Dannemeyer) in some respects," 
said Norman J. Ornstein, a Congress watcher and political scientist with the 
Washington-based American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. 
"He's really out in the bleachers." 
</P>
<P>
According to those who watch his performance in Congress, Dannemeyer pays a 
price for his outspokenness -- or outrageousness. 
</P>
<P>
He clearly makes many Republicans uncomfortable. In 1988, when he sought the 
chairmanship of the House Republican Conference, he won only seven votes. A 
year earlier, he lost out to two freshmen congressmen in a bid for a seat on 
the House Budget Committee, despite his well-known interest in fiscal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Some local officials complain privately that Dannemeyer, because of his staunch 
fiscal conservatism, often has voted against spending bills that benefit Orange 
County. But he did work hard to win approval for funds to begin construction of 
the $1.5-billion Santa Ana River flood control project, they say. 
</P>
<P>
In the legislative arena, Dannemeyer has a mixed record. His bills, like those 
of most members of the minority party, are routinely put on the back burner by 
Democratic committee chairmen. His annual alternate budget resolutions lose by 
wide margins. 
</P>
<P>
"He becomes so inflexible . . . that it becomes difficult for him to accomplish 
much of anything of what he wants," said Rep. Henry A. Waxman, the liberal Los 
Angeles Democrat who is Dannemeyer's nemesis on the issues of AIDS and clean 
air. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer, Waxman said, "will seek opportunities to try to make his point even 
if it has nothing to do with the issue at hand. . . . It's almost an assault on 
people, that this is what he believes and everybody else must be confronted 
with it rather than persuaded." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Dannemeyer has won some notable floor fights. In early 1989, he managed to 
turn a motion to adjourn the House into a symbolic vote on a Congressional pay 
raise that he opposed, and he prevailed. Last fall, he persuaded the House to 
accept strict guidelines on telephone "dial-a-porn" services. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, three of his amendments to new AIDS legislation were adopted in 
committee or subcommittee. But he lost a 312-113 floor vote on the most 
significant amendment, which would have forced states to require doctors to 
report to public health agencies the identities of patients who test positive 
for the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Dannemeyer's infrequent legislative successes, Ornstein said, "one of 
the things you can say about the handful of people in the Congress who verge to 
the fringes is that . . . they often, by stirring up the dust in areas people 
don't want stirred up, get discussion going that might not otherwise take 
place." 
</P>
<P>
A case in point, Ornstein said, is Dannemeyer's speech on Mandela. "While the 
analogy he raised about Nelson Mandela was ungracious, and for an awful lot of 
people, deeply offensive . . . it raised to another level of discussion the 
question of who and what Nelson Mandela is." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees. Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen last week 
denounced Dannemeyer as "the renaissance man of bigotry." His remarks about 
Mandela were "as repulsive a statement as Washington has heard in recent 
times," Cohen wrote. 
</P>

"He's dangerous," said Stoddard, the gay rights activist, who has debated 
Dannemeyer on television and in other public forums. "He plays upon people's 
fears. . . . Dannemeyer calls himself a conservative and he invokes the mantle 
of American ideals, but in fact his ideals are, to my mind, profoundly 
un-American. For whatever reason, he holds animus toward a category of 
individuals that encompasses millions of Americans. That's not a good thing. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
"Any individual in a position of power who preaches hatred or intolerance 
disserves the American public and promotes social disintegration. It's as 
simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer and his staff dispute the views that he is on the fringes of 
political thought or a bigot. 
</P>
<P>
"The homosexual activists have said I'm an extremist," Dannemeyer said. "But 
the fact of the matter is, my views (on homosexuality) reflect the views of 
probably three-fourths of the American people, poll after poll." He noted that 
he won re-election in 1988 his 39th Congressional District, in north central 
Orange County, with 74% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer "honestly is one of those guys who just does not hate anybody," said 
Paul Mero, his press secretary. "Bill is one, believe it or not, to live and 
let live. The problem that he finds is when misbehavior becomes the standard. 
He's not willing to put up with that." 
</P>
<P>
If there is a unifying theme to Dannemeyer's world view, it seems rooted to his 
strongly held religious convictions and his belief in moral standards. 
</P>
<P>
"To us," said Mero, a devout Mormon, "it's those who believe in a God against 
those who don't." 
</P>
<P>
A son of German immigrants, Dannemeyer worked long hours at various jobs after 
his father's ill health and the Depression cost the family its livelihood -- a 
feed and grain store in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
He put himself through Valparaiso University, a private Lutheran college in 
Valparaiso, Ind., about 45 miles southeast of Chicago, graduated from Hastings 
College of Law in San Francisco, and served for two years in the U.S. Army's 
counterintelligence corps in West Germany during the mid-1950s. 
</P>
<P>
He met his wife, Evelyn Hoemann, a Lutheran minister's daughter, while living 
at a Lutheran hostel in downtown Los Angeles. They have a son and two 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, his law practice and real estate investments have made him 
comfortable financially, if not wealthy by Orange County standards. On his 
latest financial disclosure form, he reported income of at least $80,000 from 
real estate holdings in addition to his congressional salary. 
</P>
<P>
When Dannemeyer talks about homosexuality, which he does often, or the need for 
gold-backed currency, or Nelson Mandela, he speaks wistfully of the lost values 
of small-town America and of an emerging, new society he says has turned its 
back on what he calls the Judeo-Christian ethic. 
</P>
<P>
In one of his Mandela speeches, he said: "These days . . . the world seems 
turned on its head. We care more for the rights of criminals than those of 
victims. . . . The doctrine of free speech has been extended to obscene art, 
flag burners and those who would subvert the Constitution. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Forget the right to the pursuit of happiness; you're now entitled to 
happiness. And if you can't find it, take it from somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
In his book, which has sold about 20,000 copies through mail orders, Dannemeyer 
echoes the theme. 
</P>
<P>
In earlier times, Dannemeyer writes, homosexuals kept their sex lives private. 
"That was all society really asked of them -- the right not to be affronted by 
militant immorality or perversion." 
</P>
<P>
Now, he continues, "homosexuals are proclaiming that they will no longer be 
satisfied with mere acceptance by society. They are now demanding official 
approbation." 
</P>
<P>
It is Dannemeyer's fight against homosexual activists, and his efforts to enact 
federal laws to require doctors to report to public health authorities the 
identities of those who are infected with the AIDS virus, that have earned him 
the most enmity. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Dannemeyer has an interest in homosexuality that goes beyond that of most 
gay people I know," said Stoddard. "I suspect, frankly, only a therapist could 
explain it." 
</P>
<P>
Dannemeyer acknowledges that some believe he is obsessed with homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
"It has even been suggested that I must be a homosexual myself, not able to 
confront the hellish reality, and hence left to fight my true feelings," he 
said in a speech on the House floor. "Let me try to put my work on this issue 
into perspective. I am preoccupied with the issue of AIDS and its alter-ego, 
homosexuality, like a family physician is preoccupied with a client family. No 
attention needs to be paid to a well family. . . . But when disease rears its 
ugly head, the family physician is there to help battle the affliction." 
</P>
<P>
Jacobs, the Indiana congressman who asked for the obscenity investigation, said 
he believes Dannemeyer's "preoccupation with the gays is a fairly sincere one," 
but added: "I don't think it's entirely fair. . . . If people are dealt that 
hand in life and are so enormously unpopular anyway, I don't know that it's 
exactly sporting to smack them around." 
</P>
<P>
But, as with most issues involving Dannemeyer, there is an opposing view. Said 
Republican Rep. Dan Burton, who has proposed mandatory AIDS testing for most 
Americans: "I think we need more congressmen like him."

<P>
Ron Mix is one of three Charger alumni in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but 
the highlight of his career occurred in a game in which he never threw a block. 
</P>
<P>
As dominating as Mix was as an eight-time all-star offensive tackle in the 
American Football League during the '60s, he was frustrated by the arrogant 
attitude of the National Football League. As far as most NFL people were 
concerned, anyone connected with the AFL was a second-class citizen. 
</P>
<P>
That all changed on Jan. 12, 1969, when Broadway Joe Namath made good on a 
seemingly ridiculous boast and led the New York Jets to a 16-7 victory over the 
Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III in Miami. All of a sudden, the football world 
was hit with the news that the AFL was for real. 
</P>
<P>
Mix was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1979, following ex-Charger wide 
receiver Lance Alworth by a year. Sid Gillman, the Chargers' first coach, 
joined the club in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
However, considering the disdain with which the AFL was regarded for so long, 
who knows whether these three would have made it if the Jets hadn't pulled off 
their monumental upset? 
</P>
<P>
As it was, Alworth and Mix gave the Chargers the distinction of having the 
first two AFL products to be so honored. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Jets won," said Mix, a 52-year-old attorney who lives in Point Loma, 
"it validated the careers of all of us in the AFL. Everybody knew then that the 
AFL was a major league. 
</P>
<P>
"All those years, being from the AFL, I didn't know if any of us had a chance 
for the Hall of Fame. That one game put the two leagues on the same level." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the NFL hadn't been alone in scoffing at the AFL, which was founded 
in 1960 with the Chargers as charter members. The majority of fans tended to 
agree, and this opinion was reinforced when the Green Bay Packers of the NFL 
trampled the Kansas City Chiefs and Oakland Raiders in Super Bowls I and II. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard an awful lot of taunts about NFL superiority," Mix said. "Not from 
the NFL players, understand. They were thrilled because we created competition 
for their services and salaries went up. But NFL management was always rough on 
us, and we resented this because we knew how good we were. We knew eventually 
that we were just as good as they were. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first four or five years of our existence, the NFL was in a frame of 
mind that we would die and go away. We couldn't compete financially for the top 
players, so we had trouble establishing ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
"But because we had only eight teams and they had 12 and then 14, we had a 
numerical advantage in strengthening our teams. Once we began signing our share 
of players, dividing talent among fewer teams gave us a better distribution of 
the best talent in football. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, the public perception before Super Bowl III was that we were inferior." 
</P>
<P>
Even Mix himself has to admit that, all other things being equal, he would have 
preferred the NFL over the AFL after winning All-American honors at USC. 
</P>
<P>
In the NFL draft of 1960, Mix was the first-round choice of the Colts. In the 
AFL, which did not list its draftees by rounds, he was picked by the Boston 
Patriots. Shortly after the draft, the Patriots traded his rights to the 
Chargers, who were then -- for their inaugural season only -- based in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"A representative of the Chargers called and wanted to know if I was interested 
in playing in the AFL," Mix said. "I told him, 'No, if I have to go back East, 
I would rather play in the NFL.' 
</P>
<P>
"The man asked if I might change my mind if the Chargers acquired my rights. In 
those days, AFL clubs would cooperate with each other to try to get guys to 
come into the league. 
</P>
<P>
"Since I was born in East Los Angeles and went to Hawthorne High School and 
USC, this could be ideal. Nevertheless, I wanted to play in Baltimore if the 
terms were right." 
</P>
<P>
Despite Mix's avowed preference, the Chargers made the deal for his rights. 
Then they beat the odds by outbidding the Colts for his services. 
</P>
<P>
"The Colts offered me $8,000 a year and a $1,000 bonus," Mix said. "The 
Chargers made an offer of $12,000 and a $5,000 bonus. I told the Colts that if 
they'd give me $10,000 and $2,000, I'd sign with them. 
</P>
<P>
"They said no. The man I dealt with said, 'That league (the AFL) will be lucky 
to last a year, and then you'll be with us at a salary that won't upset our 
salary schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided there was too big a spread between the two offers. I also figured 
that if the Colts were right and I was with the Chargers only one year, I'd be 
in the NFL and could negotiate again. So I signed with the Chargers." 
</P>
<P>
Having maneuvered his way home to start his pro career, Mix was not overjoyed 
when the Chargers relocated in San Diego after one season. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a disappointment," he said. "One reason I signed in the AFL was to 
remain in Los Angeles. I remember thinking I should have gone to Baltimore." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Mix's negative reaction to the move didn't last long. 
</P>
<P>
"I changed my mind in about three minutes," he said. "San Diego is such a 
beautiful place to live. When I drove to town, somebody recognized me. In L.A., 
I was anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess all you have to know about my feelings toward San Diego is that I 
still live here. The whole thing turned out perfectly for me." 
</P>
<P>
Mix noted that while some AFL clubs had to cut financial corners to survive, 
the Chargers had an affluent owner in Barron Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a few ownership changes, but no clubs went bankrupt," Mix said. 
"And with Barron, the Chargers always went first class. We stayed in quality 
hotels, we had great training-camp facilities, fine practice fields. He did 
everything right." 
</P>
<P>
Also, Mix found it convenient in San Diego to combine law school with football. 
He received his law degree from the University of San Diego in 1970, after 
playing with the Chargers from 1960 through 1969 and before "un-retiring" for 
the 1971 season with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
"I went four years to night school at USD," he said. "I didn't intend to go 
into law at first. I just wanted to get the education. I remember reading 
Esquire, and it said the best education to give yourself was a legal education. 
That helped me decide on it." 
</P>
<P>
Between his careers as a football player and a lawyer, Mix took a job in 1974 
as general manager of the Portland Storm of the short-lived World Football 
League. 
</P>
<P>
"I decided to try it for one year," he said. "I had a great salary. If I had 
gotten paid, it would have been even better." 
</P>
<P>
Mix's impressive combination of mental and physical ability led Joe Madro, the 
Chargers' first offensive line coach, to call him "the intellectual assassin." 
</P>
<P>
While the noun Madro used to label Mix was a bit heavy, Mix was truly a 
thinking man's football player. At 6-4 and 250, he was both one of the 
strongest lineman in the game and one of the smartest. He was called for 
holding only twice in his 10 seasons as a Charger. If he had a rare tough day, 
the defensive end who outplayed him paid for it the next time around. 
</P>
<P>
Mix's favorite character among his old Charger teammates was Ernie Ladd, a 6-9 
defensive tackle whose playing weight was around 350 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Ernie's appetite was legendary," Mix said. "In training camp, he would eat 18 
eggs over-easy, a pound of bacon, a pound a ham and a loaf of bread and drink a 
half-gallon of milk. 
</P>
<P>
"He was in town about six months ago and I was so stupid that I invited him out 
to breakfast. He looks like he weighs 450 now, and I could see why. The tab for 
two was $36." 
</P>
<P>
Mix was not one of those athletes who aspired to a pro football career from 
childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a late developer," he said. "In my senior year in high school, I was 6-2 
and 168. I didn't have a college scholarship, but I got elected for the High 
School All-Star Game, and I kind of blossomed. From just that one game, I got a 
scholarship to USC. 
</P>
<P>
"At SC, though, they worked us so hard and the practices were so grueling that 
they took the fun out of it. Don Clark was the coach, and I wished I had the 
courage to quit. I hated football. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day, we were driven to exhaustion. At the end of practice, we wondered 
if we were going to die. I couldn't wait 'til football was over." 
</P>
<P>
During the suffering process, Mix built himself up to 250 and became the best 
offensive tackle in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't a natural athlete, but I worked twice as hard as anybody else," he 
said. "I started lifting weights when nobody else did, when I was a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
"The prevailing thought at that time was that weight-lifting would tie up your 
muscles. The McKeever twins (Mike and Marlin) and I were the only ones on the 
squad lifting weights, and I guess we were the three best players. We were all 
All-Americans." 
</P>
<P>
As tough a taskmaster as Gillman was, Mix found life in the pros more 
tolerable. 
</P>
<P>
"Sid worked us hard enough to get us ready, but never drove us to exhaustion," 
Mix said. "He was called the father of offensive football, and rightly so. He 
was a brilliant coach, and we always felt that having him gave us an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
"He ran such a tight ship that nobody wanted to get him angry. One night in 
training camp at USD, Jacque McKinnon and I stayed out after curfew. The only 
way we could reach our apartment was to go past his, and he was sitting there 
with his window open, studying film. We got down on our stomachs and did the 
Marine crawl. 
</P>
<P>
"We managed to pull it off, but he'll probably fine us when he reads this." 
</P>
<P>
Mix was equally adept at blocking for the run and the pass. In the 1963 
championship game against the Patriots, in which the Chargers won the only 
title in their history, he threw three blocks on a 58-yard touchdown run by 
Paul Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
Gillman, 78, who is retired and has a home on the grounds of the La Costa Hotel 
and Spa, puts Mix on a level all his own. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the best offensive lineman I've ever seen," Gillman said. "There was 
nothing he couldn't do. 
</P>
<P>
"When we picked a tackle, we hoped he could do three things: be our lead 
blocker on the toss to a running back; give pass protection and fire out and 
occupy the defensive man in his area. 
</P>
<P>
"He did all these things so well that he dominated everybody. And he was a 
terrific guy along with it." 
</P>
<P>
Told of Gillman's kind words, Mix grinned and said, "Who am I to argue with a 
Hall of Fame coach?"
