EXXON VALDEZ IS CALLED LIKELY OIL SLICK SOURCE 
</P>

Coast Guard officials said Tuesday that the Exxon Valdez, the tanker 
responsible for dumping 11 million gallons of oil off Alaska, probably is the 
source of a 10-mile oil slick off the San Diego coast and is trailing a smaller 
sheen as it waits offshore to enter the harbor for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The two lines of oil, as well as huge, steel plates jutting down from the 
crippled tanker's hull that prevent it from clearing the harbor bottom, will 
delay the ship's docking for at least several days, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The 987-foot tanker was expected to dock Tuesday morning at the National Steel 
&amp; Shipbuilding Co. yard for repairs. But final inspections by the Coast 
Guard and other agencies revealed the oil slicks and the dangling steel plates, 
and the ship was instructed to stay out of the harbor indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
Tests conducted late Monday night did not confirm whether the oil slick, at one 
point as much as 18 miles long and 200 yards wide, was directly caused by the 
tanker, now sitting about 40 miles off Point Loma and slowly moving southwest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'A Positive Fingerprint' 
</P>
<P>
But Coast Guard authorities, awaiting results from their own tests, said they 
are assuming the Valdez was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't got a positive fingerprint. But they (Exxon officials) were wrong. 
The ship is not squeaky clean," said Cmdr. Frank Scarborough, during a press 
conference early Tuesday at Coast Guard headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon officials acknowledged that the Valdez was leaking what appeared to be 
oil and trailing a brown sheen at least 3 miles long and 25 yards wide, but 
said they were not certain the bigger slick had been caused by the tanker. 
</P>
<P>
"We have confirmed that there is material coming out of the Exxon Valdez," said 
John Tompkins, fleet services manager for the oil company. "But we still don't 
know if there's any association with the (major) slick and the Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to tell you, the lack of trying and the lack of effort was not there. 
We took every precaution we knew how," Tompkins continued. Before the Valdez 
left Alaska, "In every part of that ship, we removed every bit of oil, all the 
free oil that was there. This isn't what we had in our design." 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials said the bigger slick may have been caused by a merchant 
ship or another oil tanker, and that winds may have blown it within a mile of 
the Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
That oil slick has been dissipated by winds and is heading out to sea, and 
poses little danger to marine life or San Diego beaches, state fish and game 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Valdez, towed by two tugs and accompanied by another tug and a salvage 
boat, arrived off San Diego late Sunday, after leaving Prince William Sound on 
June 23 for the 2,200-mile voyage. 
</P>
<P>
On March 24, the giant tanker hit a reef in Alaska and spilled millions of 
gallons of oil, fouling hundreds of miles of pristine Alaskan shoreline, 
killing thousands of animals and upsetting the fishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
About 42 million gallons of oil aboard the Valdez were transferred to other 
tankers, and tests showed about one part of oil per million parts of water 
remained in the ship's tanks, Exxon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Before it left Alaska, oil company leaders assured San Diego agencies and 
environmental groups that the ship's tanks had been scrubbed and cleaned of 
oil, and that the Coast Guard, Environmental Protection Agency, state of Alaska 
and other agencies had approved the ship's transit to San Diego for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
But tests conducted Tuesday by the Regional Water Quality Control Board 
appeared to match oil from the sheen to a milky white substance seen bubbling 
up from the ship's bottom late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, authorities said one possible source of the slicks was the discharge 
of seawater from the Valdez' tanks as the ship approached the harbor, to allow 
it to clear the harbor's bottom. 
</P>
<P>
That possibility, as well as a theory that turbulent ocean waves loosened 
residual oil within the ship's tanks as they washed through the open hull, were 
reiterated Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Exxon theorized that, as a result of bringing the ship up, with the turbulence 
of flushing it out . . . it had a scouring effect that is removing pockets of 
oil that were not cleaned," said Scarborough. "That's the most likely 
possibility. I think it's very likely that the (discharge) effort flushed out 
materials that (Exxon) didn't think were there." 
</P>
<P>
To stop the spill, the Coast Guard and Exxon on Tuesday were filling the tanker 
with water, lowering the ship from a depth of about 24 feet to about 33 feet, 
to float the oil up inside the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
The method seemed to be working by late afternoon as the sheen trailing the 
ship lessened, Coast Guard officials reported. 
</P>
<P>
The measure also may have been the first step toward removing the steel plates 
that make it impossible for the tanker to enter San Diego's harbor. The 
condition with the ship plate was created during the voyage when turbulence 
peeled back the steel around the damaged areas of the hull. 
</P>
<P>
Once authorities are certain no more oil is leaking from the Valdez, the ship 
will be moved on its own power to an area with shallower, calmer waters, 
Scarborough said. The active sea around the ship's current position makes it 
difficult for divers to remove the five 1-inch-thick steel plates, about 40 
feet long and 65 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
The waters off San Clemente Island appeared to be the most likely site for the 
procedure, although officials also were considering the Coronado-Point Loma 
area. 
</P>
<P>
But the process could be troublesome. If the ship leaks oil or Exxon dumps the 
steel plates in state waters around San Clemente Island, the oil company could 
face civil and criminal penalties for polluting the ocean. Federal and 
international laws against pollution also could trigger such penalties, but may 
not be as stringent as state regulations, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It could create a problem, if they don't get it cleaned up before they take it 
in there," said Capt. Rod Shackelford of the California Department of Fish and 
Game, which enforces state water laws. 
</P>
<P>
If the plates can be removed, the ship can be filled with water and draw as 
much as 38 feet while still clearing the 42-foot deep harbor channel, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Timpson said he is unsure when the ship can be moved, Scarborough said 
the Coast Guard may order a 24-hour waiting period once the leak appears to be 
stopped, to practice maneuvering the tanker and to ensure no more oil is 
discharged. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, environmentalists Tuesday rallied in protest against Exxon. 
</P>
<P>
About 100 people demonstrated at Coronado Tidelands Park, across the bay from 
the Naasco repair yard. Members of Greenpeace, the Sierra Club, Environmental 
Health Coalition and other groups called for penalties against the oil company 
and an end to America's dependence on fossil fuels, and encouraged a new 
national energy agenda. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking about a much deeper problem than a sea captain who had a few too 
many shots of whiskey and an oil company that's greedy for profits," said Rick 
Nadeau, director of Greenpeace Action in San Diego. "The Exxon Valdez has 
become a symbol of the destruction of our oceans and the destruction of our 
atmosphere, and represents our addiction to fossil fuels." 
</P>
<P>
Added Carole Jo Oberle, a protester and local elementary school teacher: "It's 
so frightening. I can see our shores following Alaska's lead. God help us." 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Cmdr. Scarborough said he was frustrated by the Valdez incident, 
but that he would not chastise Exxon. "My assessment is that they are as 
surprised as we are that this is happening. I can honestly say that they took 
all the precautions we asked them to take." 
</P>
<P>
In response to calls by state politicians for more durable construction of 
oil-carrying tankers, Tompkins said Exxon will "study" proposals such as one 
requiring the ships to have double hulls, but probably won't change the 
construction of the Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
The Valdez, built by Naasco in 1986, is a single-hulled ship. Naasco will have 
to repair an area 700 feet long and 100 feet wide on the ship's hull, as well 
as another hole about 20 feet by 15 feet, Exxon officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"We plan on rebuilding this vessel in the same manner it was built before," 
said Tompkins.

SPAT BREWS OVER CAR LOT OF ELITE 
</P>

<P>
Looking for a used car with a pedigree? Maybe a luxury-model Mercedes with low 
mileage, driven only to weekly private tennis lessons? 
</P>
<P>
Or how about a vintage Rolls-Royce, one that's accustomed to being parked 
outside an exclusive North County address? 
</P>
<P>
Well, forget National City's Mile of Cars. Ditto for Car Country Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
Come on down to the Block of Beauties at the corner of Highland Avenue and 
Lomas Santa Fe Boulevard in Solana Beach. No pushy salesmen here. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the nearby community of Rancho Santa Fe have turned a street 
corner across from the exclusive Lomas Santa Fe Country Club into a bustling 
weekend sales lot where exotic cars are being sold at the drop of a phone 
number. 
</P>
<P>
As in other neighborhoods around San Diego County, the Highland Avenue site in 
Lomas Santa Fe was turned into a car lot by locals who wanted space along an 
oft-traveled thoroughfare to show off their used cars to a buying public. 
</P>
<P>
This, however, is affluent North County. So the cars are usually sleek, foreign 
and expensive. Not a clunker in the lot. 
</P>
<P>
On any Saturday and Sunday, BMWs and Jaguars and Bentleys -- not to mention an 
occasional Volkswagen beetle -- can be found parked along the residential 
block, each displaying "For Sale" signs to turn the heads of local motorists. 
</P>
<P>
All of which has miffed the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate that block," said Deputy Michael Cea, recently assigned to the 
department's motorcycle patrol in Solana Beach. "I don't have anything against 
people trying to sell their cars. And I don't have anything against people who 
park their own cars legally to take a look at what's for sale. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'About to Wage War on Situation' 
</P>
<P>
"What I don't like are the people who stop in the middle of the road to take a 
look-see or jot down a phone number. They hold up traffic and create a 
dangerous situation. And I'm about to wage war on the entire situation." 
</P>
<P>
An ordinance adopted by the city of Solana Beach sets several conditions on the 
advertising of used cars on city streets, according to Cea. 
</P>
<P>
Such vehicles must display their signs -- which can be no larger than 8 1/2 by 
11 inches -- in a side window only, not the front or back ones, the ordinance 
states. 
</P>
<P>
"If these people did that, they'd be within the law," Cea said. "But the code 
isn't really well-known or understood, even by our own deputies. Many of them 
will see a car up for sale on the street and bing! They'll tag it with a ticket 
without ever looking to see where the sign is placed." 
</P>
<P>
Several residents who have displayed cars on the lot said they were unaware of 
the code. 
</P>
<P>
"I certainly didn't know about it," said Bob Meyer, a Rancho Santa Fe resident 
who recently placed his 1985 Jaguar X-J6 on the Highland Avenue block. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'People With Cash in Their Pockets' 
</P>
<P>
Meyer is asking $20,000 for the car, which has a mere 49,000 miles logged. He 
doesn't expect it to sit there for long. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an amazing little place," he said. "I've sold cars there before. There's 
a lot of traffic on that street, people with cash in their pockets. And 
everyone uses their own marketing approach. 
</P>
<P>
"I use tear-off tags so people don't have to go looking through their glove box 
for a pen and paper. And it works." 
</P>
<P>
So far, no Lomas Santa Fe club members have lodged complaints against the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard any complaints about it," general manager Mike Carey said. 
"But that doesn't mean that our members don't have their own thoughts about it. 
They might even be sellers from time to time." 
</P>
<P>
But some residents have complained that the cars, no matter how classy, are 
disturbing the neighborhood peace with the traffic they attract. 
</P>
<P>
"All weekend long, these people drive down the street, going 2 miles an hour, 
looking at these cars," said 21-year-old Tom Archino, whose family's house sits 
several yards from where the cars are parked. 
</P>
<P>
"It's dangerous. There's joggers and people walking their dogs going by there 
all the time," Archino said. "If people are gonna sell cars, they should use a 
lot, not park them on the street. Nobody in our family is too happy about it. 
But we're not going to start a neighborhood war over it." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Cea said he plans to keep a closer eye on the block to ensure 
that sellers play by the rules. He'll be scouting out the goods during work 
hours only, of course.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEUKMEJIAN KILLS PLAN TO SELL LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a setback for Hawthorne officials and residents, Gov. George Deukmejian has 
cut from the state's $49.3-billion budget a provision requiring the California 
Department of Transportation to sell the city two parcels of property for 
$200,000. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans, which claims that the properties are worth at least $3.3 million, 
opposes the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Provisions of the sale were set forth in a bill approved in June. The bill, by 
Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Hawthorne), is to go before the state Senate 
Transportation Committee on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The requirement that Caltrans sell the properties for $200,000 was contained in 
the proposed state budget submitted to the governor in late June. In a memo 
listing his cuts from the proposed budget, Deukmejian said Friday that sale of 
the properties at below-market value would not be in the state's interest. 
</P>
<P>
Residents of the affluent Holly Glen area of Hawthorne have urged the city to 
acquire for parkland the 4.7-acre parcel known as the "Glasgow Strip." The 
narrow, mile-long property alongside the San Diego Freeway has been used as a 
dumping ground and become an eyesore and safety hazard, the Holly Glen 
Taxpayers Assn. says.

The job of city zoning analyst sounds unexciting -- unless your beat includes 
Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this blurb from an inspector who toured "an adult encounter 
establishment (bondage and discipline)," known as Chateau Order of Roissy, 
which was seeking a permanent operating permit: 
</P>
<P>
"The Zoning Analyst observed many different types of wooden body racks where an 
individual can be hanged into the air with support only from the shoulders and 
wrists, as well as full body racks where an individual's body is placed and 
wheeled around in a contorted fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"The analyst also observed an approximate 4-foot by 4-foot by 3 1/2-foot-high 
wooden cage. The proprietor informed the analyst that the cage is used to 
restrain customers." 
</P>
<P>
Such eye-opening observations moved the intrepid Zoning Analyst to recommend 
that the permit be denied (denied was underlined). Tuesday, the City Council 
agreed, voting to shut the place down. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, it's time for the Chateau Order of Roissy to hang 'em up. 
</P>
<P>
A month after the Lakers were swept by the Pistons in the NBA finals, Auburn 
Hills, Mich., Mayor Robert Grusnick arrived here to collect on a bet with 
Edward Vincent, his Inglewood counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
Grusnick, wearing a shirt that boasted, "We Beat L.A.," roared with laughter as 
Vincent slipped on a black Pistons "Bad Boys" shirt over his blue Oxford shirt 
and pink tie at the weekly Inglewood City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on Kareem Court near the Forum, city workers were installing a 
free-standing 3-by-5-foot sign that Grusnick brought along. It said, "Hail to 
the 1989 NBA Champions -- the Pistons of Auburn Hills, Mich. -- the Bad Boys." 
The sign is supposed to stand for 30 days, though the city hasn't assigned a 
guard to watch over it. 
</P>
<P>
Grusnick admitted that his own shirt drew some stares when he and his wife, 
Vivian, ate breakfast beforehand at a Denny's in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
"The waitress must have been a Lakers fan," he said. "She seated us all the way 
in the back." 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday marked the debut of a metal detector at the entrance to the county 
Board of Supervisors meeting room, and the device ferreted out numerous nerds, 
accountants and lazy minds -- everyone, in short, who was carrying a pocket 
calculator. 
</P>
<P>
"Pocket calculators will do it every time," one guard said. 
</P>
<P>
Security officers were stationed at the entrances, checking briefcases and 
handbags of the estimated 100 spectators who attended the session. 
</P>
<P>
The supes, themselves, entered through a back door. The precautions weren't 
airtight. A photographer saw one woman casually stroll into the board room 
through a side door when the guards weren't watching. 
</P>
<P>
The searches turned up no weapons. But Roxanne Krause, a court reporter, was 
told she couldn't take her pocket knife inside. 
</P>
<P>
She agreed to store it in her car, while confiding to a reporter: "It comes in 
handy when you peel apples. That's all I use it for." 
</P>
<P>
No word yet on when the $500-million B-2 stealth bomber is actually going to 
attempt to lift off into the air. Still, Air Force Maj. Pat Mullaney noted that 
the aircraft did achieve "a lot of firsts" when it taxied at speeds of up to 
100 m.p.h. the other day in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
"You have the first time (it was) under its own power," Mullaney said. "You 
have it turning. All this has only been done before on computer simulations." 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, though, the stealth's feat of executing a turn while on the ground 
didn't quite seem to pack the drama of such previous firsts as, say, Chuck 
Yeager and his X-1 plane breaking the sound barrier four decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, a lot of critics say Leo McCarthy, the Democratic lieutenant governor 
(remember him?), ran a lame, losing U.S. Senate campaign against Pete Wilson 
last year. But it seems a bit cruel of the Burbank-based state Republican Party 
to send McCarthy a computerized, fund-raising letter that said: 
</P>
<P>
"George Bush, Pete Wilson and George Deukmejian could not be where they are 
today without you."

BOARD OKS MORE FUNDS TO STEM THE MINORITY SCHOOL-DROPOUT TIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
San Diego city school trustees gave tentative approval Tuesday to the spending 
of more money on programs to improve the poor academic standing of many 
minority students. However, they also told top administrators that they want 
more accountability. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, the school board -- in a long and occasionally intense session -- 
said it will spend more funds to try and stem the the dropout tide, especially 
among black males, but that principals and teachers must be held accountable 
for bringing about improvements, however modest, over the next several years. 
The board told the staff to set reasonable outset goals that can be reached 
through hard work, rather than targeting long-range outcomes that have little 
expectation of being met. 
</P>
<P>
The board heard a staff proposal to give geographic clusters of schools, which 
include a high school and the junior highs and elementary schools surrounding 
it, up to $100,000 to manage better the many dropout programs and initiatives 
already under way. 
</P>
<P>
Trustees also showed support for a $250,000 pilot program at four schools with 
large numbers of black males that would set up special counselor advocates to 
give the students additional counseling, adult mentors, academic support and 
other measures. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Controversial Plan 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a majority of board members said they will stay the course with 
their controversial plan for Gompers Secondary School in Southeast San Diego. A 
still-divided Gompers staff has been ordered to give neighborhood students, 
almost all of them minority, greater access to the school's special 
math-science program heretofore limited to only a few resident students and an 
equal number of white students who bus to Gompers. 
</P>
<P>
Final action on the dropout and black male proposals is scheduled for next 
week. The board on Tuesday did approve creation of a parent-teacher study 
committee at Madison High School in Clairemont to decide whether the Madison 
community wants to close the campus during lunch and prohibit students from 
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
School district administrators admitted in their dropout report Tuesday that in 
many ways they are doing an inadequate job of managing the myriad programs in 
place to improve student academic performance and lower the number of dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
Projects to address the same problems are often implemented separately in 
varying degrees from school to school, even within the same cluster, without 
the necessary coordination to make sure that students retain the same services 
as they move from an elementary to a junior- or senior-high. 
</P>
<P>
Even within a particular school, new ideas that develop from a pilot program 
often fail to become part of the overall academic program, deputy Supt. Bertha 
Pendleton said. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, administrators conceded that they had failed to do sufficient 
follow-up at a much-publicized new dropout prevention program to know whether 
students enrolled in the special classes returned to their regular schools or 
dropped in spite of the intervention. Only on Tuesday was Pendleton able to 
tell trustees that the new program has so far succeeded in maintaining severely 
at-risk students in school. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to get more results from all the initiatives, Pendleton proposed 
that schools within a given cluster set up formal planning processes so that 
ideas and strategies can be more widely and consistently implemented. Although 
a few clusters have coordinated individual projects, none so far have attempted 
ongoing general coordination. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Goals for Attendance 
</P>
<P>
The process would include setting up goals for attendance, achievement, parent 
involvement, and dropout reduction for each cluster, as well as coming up with 
ideas and implementation deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
There would also be money, up to $100,000 a year, made available to clusters 
that come up with specific plans. In addition, those clusters that improved 
attendance -- considered the single most important predictor for future 
dropouts -- would receive a portion of the money collected by from the state as 
a result of showing higher attendance rates. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Shirley Weber suggested that Pendleton and Supt. Tom Payzant also 
consider appointing a "dropout czar" to coordinate the more than a dozen 
programs. However, Payzant said that while more supervision is needed, he does 
not want to send a message to individual teachers and principals that they 
could interpret as giving them less responsibility for making students more 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
And Pendleton emphasized that, despite all the intervention programs, the key 
to boosting the performance of students, especially black and Latinos who drop 
out in excess of 40% during their high school years, remains in improving 
regular classroom instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Pendleton's plan for black males, who perform more poorly than any other ethnic 
group or gender in the city, calls for appointing four black male advocates, 
probably special counselors, to work at four pilot schools: Knox Elementary and 
Gompers, its allied junior high; and at Fulton Elementary and Bell Junior High. 
The schools have about 850 black male students among them. 
</P>
<P>
The advocates would be charged with a wide variety of duties intended to help 
improve attendance, increase the small number of black males who now achieve 
grades of B or better and improve self-esteem, among other items. 
</P>
<P>
Trustee Jim Roache spoke for the board in finding merit with the plan, except 
that "this board always is presented grandiose objectives and goals that we 
never attain. . . . I want a few more concrete and attainable objectives, and 
say here they are, so that, if a school fails, we will withdraw the money and 
take it elsewhere."

FIRMS CHARGE EPA ADS ARE DIRTY POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE WARD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When he saw an advertisement inviting his former employees to help the U.S. 
government nail his company for environmental pollution, Bill Donahoe, owner of 
a truck-washing business, was astounded. 
</P>
<P>
"I wondered what country I was living in," Donahoe said. Surely, the United 
States of America would not solicit anonymous gossip from disgruntled 
ex-employees. 
</P>
<P>
But there it was, an ad in English in the Los Angeles Times and in Spanish in 
La Opinion that listed 51 companies topped by the headline: "Ever Worked Here?" 
The ad invited those who had worked for the companies to ask themselves whether 
they had handled hazardous chemicals and waste and whether the waste was taken 
to the Operating Industries Inc. landfill in Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Please call us!" the ad urged. "Your information can help us at this hazardous 
waste site." 
</P>
<P>
Terry Wilson, spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency's western 
region, said the EPA did nothing more than take the sort of action that 
attorneys routinely take when they place classified ads seeking witnesses to 
clients' traffic accidents. 
</P>
<P>
All of the information received by the agency will be carefully checked by 
investigators, he said, as part of an effort to put together a civil case 
against companies that shipped hazardous waste to the Monterey Park dump. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA has reached an agreement with more than 100 companies to help pay for 
the initial phases of the toxic cleanup of the Operating Industries site by 
contributing $33 million in cash and $34 million in work. But no settlement has 
been reached with more than 50 other companies that are believed by the EPA to 
have shipped hazardous waste to the dump before it was closed because of 
environmental problems in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The settlements reached so far are only for the initial stages of the cleanup 
effort. The EPA will seek additional payments to continue the cleanup, which 
could eventually cost $200 million to $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A New Tactic 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the EPA spent $50,000 on the ads, which ran every other day for two 
weeks in The Times and La Opinion. He said the ads were a new tactic, never 
before used by the EPA in any of its regions. 
</P>
<P>
The tactic was used in this case, he said, because the agency needs more 
information about waste shipments to the Monterey Park site. Some of the 
targeted companies claim that their waste was not hazardous, but lack documents 
to support that claim, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson refused to say how many calls had been elicited but said: "We had a very 
good response -- better than expected." 
</P>
<P>
He said he also "heard from a couple of senior vice presidents who were very 
agitated," about their companies being named in the ad. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Leach, owner of Leach Oil Co. in Compton, said the EPA used a "very 
low-life tactic," giving his company and others named in the ad a black eye by 
implying that they were in trouble with the EPA for wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, his company, an oil recycler, did no more than send waste to a dump 
that was licensed by government agencies to receive it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Under federal law, companies that produce hazardous waste are liable for it 
even after they have legally disposed of it. Thus, the EPA is trying to 
identify all of the companies that shipped hazardous waste to the Monterey Park 
dump and force them to share in the cleanup.

BATTERED BUSINESSES ON PIER CRY: 'WE'RE STILL HERE!' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It was a year of disasters," said Redondo Pier shop owner Judy Milner, 
recalling the 1988 fire and ocean storms that destroyed nearly half of the 
horseshoe-shaped structure. "But we're hard-core pier people, so we survive and 
go on." 
</P>
<P>
Milner's Pier Imports was heavily damaged when 20-foot waves, driven by an 
Arctic storm, rolled into King Harbor in Redondo Beach in January, 1988, and 
smashed into the 60-year-old pier. A few months later, in May, she and her 
husband, Chuck, lost four smaller shops in the Edge restaurant when a fire 
consumed that pier building. 
</P>
<P>
To replace her lost outlets -- and show her faith in the pier's future -- 
Milner is remodeling the former Port of Spain restaurant into another gift 
shop. She said it will feature a mounted 16-foot great white shark. 
</P>
<P>
The May 27 fire, which apparently started in storm-damaged electrical wiring 
under the pier, destroyed 16 of the 48 pier businesses, including the Breakers 
and Cattleman's restaurants. Damage to public and private property was 
estimated at $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third disaster that year, including an April storm that dropped a 
155-foot pier walkway into the ocean. No businesses were on that section, which 
was used for fishing and as a promenade. 
</P>
<P>
The pier is part of King Harbor, where total damage exceeded $26 million. 
Recovery in the harbor so far includes the restoration of the Portofino Inn and 
Reuben's restaurant. The Blue Moon Saloon, which was destroyed, plans to 
rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
After the pier was cleaned up, 90% of the businesses reopened. Merchants say 
their business has declined and attribute that to a widespread belief that the 
Redondo Pier no longer exists, and they say the pier and its lost sections need 
to be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
"People saw these pictures on TV and in the newspapers showing the pier in 
flames and got the impression that everything was lost," said Randy Joe, owner 
of the Sunshine Kite Co. "It's taking a long time to get the word out that 
we're still here." 
</P>
<P>
Joe said the fire last year destroyed his building and his stock of kites. "For 
a while there, I didn't know whether I'd ever get back in business," said Joe, 
who started the kite company 15 years ago when he was only 19. 
</P>
<P>
But a month after the fire, the city's Harbor Department set up a "Survivors 
Village" near the pier entrance. It provided blue-and-white tents from which 
Joe and several other small business owners could operate until permanent 
structures are built. 
</P>
<P>
"That made it possible for us to hang on," Joe said. "I worked really hard to 
get my customers back." Three months ago, he moved from his tent into a 
portable building that an architect friend designed for him. 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Director Sheila Schoettger said the 1988 disasters cost the pier 
merchants $4.6 million in lost business from 1987, when total revenue was $17.7 
million, and the city's rental income fell about 30%, a $600,000 loss, largely 
because of reduced attendance. 
</P>
<P>
"The last months of 1988 were especially terrible," she said. "The crowds 
weren't there and some of the merchants were having a hard time paying their 
bills. But in the last few months, business has really picked up." 
</P>
<P>
The Fourth of July weekend, combined with hot, smoggy weather, brought out 
large crowds, she said. "The pier business is totally dependent on the 
weather," she said. "If it's hot inland, people head for the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Although optimistic about their short-term survival, merchants say the pier can 
never be the same -- or better -- until it is rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when we have good crowds, people don't circulate the way they did when 
they could walk around the Horseshoe," said Milner of Pier Imports, indicating 
an 800-foot gap in the central portion of the pier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pedestrian Traffic Limited 
</P>
<P>
The southern side of the Horseshoe survived, along with a short leg on the 
north end that is no longer in use. Pedestrian traffic flow is further 
restricted by the loss in April of the fishing promenade that once connected 
the ocean side of the Horseshoe to the nearby Monstad Pier. 
</P>
<P>
The Monstad Pier otherwise escaped major damage, but merchants there say their 
business also has been hit hard by reduced attendance. Ernest Kim, manager of 
the Redondo Beach Coffee Shop at the end of the Monstad, said his business had 
been down 30% to 40%, until picking up in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
"Weather is the primary factor," he said. "No problem as long as the weather is 
hot." 
</P>
<P>
Newcomer Don Stinson said uncertainty over the pier's future in the wake of the 
1988 disasters caused him at first to rethink his plans to convert the old 
China Queen restaurant at the pier's entrance to Sinbad's, a seafood and steak 
restaurant similar to one he and his brother own in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's such a tremendous area," Stinson said. "We decided to go ahead with 
our plans and we haven't regretted it." 
</P>
<P>
He said Sinbad's business has steadily increased since it opened seven months 
ago, with about 60% of the patronage coming from area residents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
International Boardwalk 
</P>
<P>
Storm-driven waves caused some water damage along the International Boardwalk, 
a complex of 23 onshore businesses north of the pier parking structure. "We had 
six inches of water in here," said Heidi Von Goerlitz, office manager for the 
Fun Factory, an amusement arcade that has been in business at the pier for 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief shutdown, the boardwalk businesses, like those on the pier, were 
back in operation -- and waiting for the crowds to return. "We're advertising 
to let people know that we're still here, and business is beginning to pick 
up," Von Goerlitz said. "But last year was really slow." 
</P>
<P>
Pier Properties, the largest of three leaseholders that rent buildings to 
individual businesses, lost 70% of its structures in the 1988 disasters, said 
general partner Jay Robinson. "I had 30 tenants before it all happened," he 
said. "Now I've got 11." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said he has survived many storms since he acquired his lease from the 
city in 1962. "But in the past, we just repaired the damage and got everybody 
back in business," he said. "Now we have to wait for the city to build a new 
pier. I wish they'd get on with it." 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, the pier itself called attention to its less than robust 
condition. Another small section of the pier -- part of the abandoned Fish 
&amp; Chips restaurant -- broke loose and fell into the ocean.

EXPERIMENT'S WATER PURITY TESTS OUT; 
</P>
<P>
HYACINTHS PLUS TREATMENT KILL UP TO 99% OF VIRUSES AT PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Initial results of a study suggest that recycled waste water produced by the 
city of San Diego's unique experimental waste-water treatment plant in Mission 
Valley contains the same low level of microorganisms as untreated drinking 
water stored in nearby reservoirs. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the Berkeley-based Western Consortium for Public Health have 
determined that the first two treatment steps at the plant, which uses water 
hyacinths to eliminate pollutants, removes 90% to 99% of viruses from waste 
water, or as much as standard biological treatment methods. 
</P>
<P>
Remaining microorganisms are removed by additional -- but more traditional -- 
treatment steps, according to the report that was released Tuesday in Austin, 
Tex., during the American Society of Civil Engineers' annual Environmental 
Engineering Meeting. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Water Quality Important 
</P>
<P>
The quality of reclaimed waste water is of growing importance in San Diego 
because of a recent City Council proposal that calls for the use of 120-million 
gallons daily of reclaimed waste water for irrigation. 
</P>
<P>
That proposal calls for the city to build six water reclamation plants to 
provide treated water for use in areas such as Otay Mesa, the Interstate 15 
corridor and North City. However, those proposed treatment plants would use 
proven treatment methods rather than the experimental methods being used at the 
Mission Valley plant. 
</P>
<P>
Although the initial findings are promising, scientists associated with the 
program cautioned that the study is far from complete. 
</P>
<P>
"There are about six different phases of this study, and only one part of the 
microbiology (section) has been completed," according to Richard Danielson, a 
microbiologist with the consortium. 
</P>
<P>
The consortium's scientific staff will continue to monitor the plant's ability 
to eliminate chemical pollutants and toxic wastes including metals, organic 
solvents and pesticides. The consortium will also monitor the reliability of 
the Mission Valley plant as well as the probable reliability of a much larger 
water reclamation plant that has been proposed in the San Pasquale Valley. 
</P>
<P>
When research is completed in 1990, scientists will spend a year preparing a 
final report for the city. The city would use the final report to determine if 
the expected benefits of recycling waste water into potable water outweigh the 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
Danielson said the $2.5-million study wasn't designed to determine if San Diego 
should be turning waste water into drinking water. "We're strictly involved in 
a data-collection and analysis kind of thing," Danielson said. "We're here to 
provide . . . technical information." Whether San Diego uses the plant for 
potable water or not is up to it, Danielson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Mission Valley plant provides secondary treatment for 300,000 gallons of 
waste water a day. About 50,000 gallons receive advanced water treatment and 
are used to irrigate state-owned lands bordering nearby highways. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed aquaculture plant in the San Pasquale Valley would treat about a 
million gallons of waste water a day. Half of that water would receive advanced 
treatment. The treated water would be used by industry to irrigate land or 
would be reinjected into natural aquifers underneath the Earth's surface, 
according to Ken Thompson, the city's project manager for aquaculture 
facilities.

PRISONS AND DRUG ABUSERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I would like to applaud The Times for your editorial "Prisons Won't Do It" 
(June 28). The editorial brought out the very important point that more prison 
cells are not going to stop or slow the increase in the number of inmates. As 
The Times correctly pointed out, 75% of the inmates in Los Angeles have been 
incarcerated for drug-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
On June 19, I convened a public hearing on the shortage of drug treatment 
services in the county. At the hearing, representatives of law enforcement, 
medicine and public health, children's services, and drug treatment programs 
gave startling testimony detailing just how far behind the county has fallen in 
its ability to provide drug treatment services. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, at a time when new federal, state and local funding has been 
allocated to interdiction and prevention efforts in the "War on Drugs," similar 
funding commitments have not been made for drug treatment programs. It is not 
enough to "Just Say No." Federal funding for publicly financed drug treatment 
"slots" steadily declined between 1981 and 1987. It would take at least $14 
million to restore us to the 1981 level of service, which provided treatment 
for almost 7,100 drug abusers. 
</P>
<P>
This is unfortunate because addicts not in treatment place great costs on 
society, in the form of crime, prosecution and incarceration costs. 
Additionally, there are the risks of drug-addicted babies and AIDS transmission 
as a result of addicts not in treatment. Clearly, there is a need to invest 
resources in treatment services so as to minimize and possibly avoid greater 
human and taxpayer costs. 
</P>
<P>
Were access to treatment available on demand, many drug abusers could be helped 
to recover. As UCLA researcher Dr. Douglas Anglin pointed out at the June 19 
hearing, "There is incontrovertible evidence that drug abuse treatment works." 
Further, research studies of court-ordered treatment have clearly demonstrated 
the benefits of counseling and rehabilitation, in conjunction with 
incarceration, or the threat of incarceration. Unfortunately, there are more 
than 1,700 persons waiting to enter county programs which already have a 4- to 
6-month waiting list. When their opportunity to enter a program arrives, many 
will have lost interest or be unavailable due to incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
On June 27 the board approved my motion to direct the Department of Health 
Services to develop a drug treatment demonstration project for convicted drug 
offenders. Such a program, in collaboration with the sheriff, district 
attorney, Superior Court and Probation Department, would serve as a model, and 
more effectively utilize our limited resources by coupling treatment with 
conviction, probation, and/or incarceration. The board will consider funding 
for this project when it holds budget deliberations beginning on July 19.

CHINESE PROTESTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
In response to the false accusation made by the Los Angeles Chinese Consulate 
("Chinese in L.A. Trade Allegations: Consulate's Charges of Payment to 
Protesters Angrily Denied," Metro, June 28), I would like to make a proposal: 
</P>
<P>
Let the Los Angeles Chinese Consulate offer $100 per person to support the 
Chinese government for its "justified" actions. I would like to know how many 
participants the Consulate can get. 
</P>
<P>
It is an insult to all who participated the demonstrations, including myself. 
</P>
<P>
I finally realized what level of intelligence those people are at after they 
killed and jailed those who are better. I am really sad and ashamed, as a 
Chinese, to see China be ruled by people who are this mindless. 
</P>
<P>
A ruler who rules a country without heart will never prevail.

<P>
Your editorial, while correctly pointing to substance abuse as the primary 
cause for our overcrowded jails and prisons, doesn't go far enough in focusing 
on solutions. Building more jails and expanding treatment programs should be 
important components of any anti-drug strategy; however, in the long run, 
prevention through education absolutely must be the spearhead of our united 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
We must guarantee that all our youngsters are "inoculated" through an infusion 
of knowledge of the dangers of substance abuse when they are most susceptible 
to that information. Programs where schoolteachers and law enforcement officers 
join to build self-esteem, coping skills, as well as accurate information about 
drug use, must be expanded throughout our county and nation. 
</P>
<P>
Although programs such as our department's Substance Abuse and Narcotics 
Education (SANE) and the Los Angeles Police Department's Drug Abuse Resistance 
Education (DARE) are only a few years old, they offer the best hope for 
reducing the appetite or demand for drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
The more the media can call the attention of their readers and viewers to this 
simple truth, the faster teachers, cops, parents and taxpayers and everyone 
else who has a stake in this country's future can stop reacting to this problem 
and start preventing it.

SALE OF PHONY DOCUMENTS TO ALIENS CHARGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Calexico accountant was arraigned in U.S. District Court in San Diego Tuesday 
on seven counts of creating and selling false immigration documents. 
</P>
<P>
The action was the latest in a series of similar cases arising in Imperial 
County. 
</P>
<P>
Adrian Garcia Ramirez pleaded not guilty to selling phony paper work to illegal 
aliens certifying that they had worked in agricultural jobs in the United 
States. The documents allegedly sold at a cost of up to $2,000 a set. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant U.S. Atty. William Q. Hayes charged that Garcia may have sold 
documents to as many as 500 prospective amnesty applicants. 
</P>
<P>
A 1986 law allowed aliens who could show they worked 90 days in U.S. 
agriculture, during the 12-month period from May 1985 to May 1986, to file for 
legal residence. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. authorities have said that they suspect fraudulent applications may have 
been filed by as many as one-third of the 1.3 million agriculture amnesty 
seekers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
Charges of fraud have been filed against a number of farm labor contractors and 
notaries public from Imperial Valley, an important agricultural region.

TICKETING PROBLEM LED TO ILL WOMAN'S ORDEAL AT AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A problem over payment of an airline ticket was the source of confusion that 
led a 70-year-old Panorama City woman to become disoriented and wander around 
Los Angeles International Airport for four days and three nights, Los Angeles 
police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Rodriguez was supposed to use a prepaid ticket, issued on a credit card, 
to board a flight last Wednesday to Lincoln, Neb., to join her family, said 
Detective Mel Arnold, citing information police have pieced together since her 
plight was discovered two days ago. But at check-in, Rodriguez "was not issued 
a ticket because of a problem with the credit card," Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez thought the problem was temporary and checked into a hotel near LAX. 
She returned to the airport the next day but again could not get a ticket. 
Meanwhile, her luggage, which contained her daily medication for heart and 
diabetes problems, had been misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
"She was becoming disoriented and sick because of the lack of medication," 
Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez did not have enough money for a hotel room. By Friday, she had run 
out of money for food. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez's ordeal ended Sunday when volunteers at a Travelers Aid Society 
booth at the airport came to her aid and notified police. She was taken to 
Tarzana Regional Medical Center, where she remained Tuesday under treatment for 
various ailments and agitation. Authorities were planning to reunite her with 
her family upon her recovery. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said the problems occurred during Rodriguez's long-planned move with her 
son, Robin Breadwell, 39, and daughter, Emily Breadwell, 47, to Dwight, Neb. 
Because of her poor health, her children decided to fly her to Nebraska rather 
than make her drive with them, Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
On July 5, they put her on a shuttle bus to LAX. The Breadwells then left for 
Nebraska in a car and a truck carrying the family's belongings. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said her children told Rodriguez to check into an airport motel in 
Lincoln and wait for them to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Credit-Card Purchase 
</P>
<P>
When the Breadwells arrived in Lincoln late Friday night, they could not find 
their mother and reported her missing to police there. Arnold said he did not 
know what was wrong with the credit-card purchase. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Edelstein, director of the Travelers Aid office at LAX, said the society 
and the hospital were planning to collect donations to pay for Rodriguez's 
travel expenses and to replace her lost clothing and luggage. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to get her reunited with her family," said Edelstein, who added that 
efforts to find Rodriguez's luggage have been unsuccessful. "The family is very 
concerned about her." 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said Rodriguez will probably remain hospitalized for at least two 
more days.

SLAIN NEWHALL GIRL'S FATHER KILLS HIMSELF AT HER GRAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY and AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wallace Scott Mann spent an all-day vigil Monday at the grave in a Newhall 
cemetery where his slain 7-year-old daughter was buried, sometimes sitting on 
the grave, sometimes watching it from his car. 
</P>
<P>
A cemetery worker at the Eternal Valley Memorial Park saw him use red paint to 
fill in the lines of the happy face and the heart carved on the stone that 
marks where Sara Nan Hodges was buried. The girl was found strangled March 26 
in a neighbor's home in Newhall after authorities and residents mounted an 
extensive three-day search for her. 
</P>
<P>
The worker saw Mann paint the petals of the roses carved on the tombstone next 
to an inscription that reads in part, "Sarie's magic is everlasting as is our 
love. Mom &amp; Dad." 
</P>
<P>
And then sometime during the night, authorities said, Mann, 36, of Ojai, took a 
shotgun from his car, fired it into his head and fell dead across the grave. 
His body was found there Tuesday morning, next to a note that said he loved his 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of Sara's slaying, Mann had been separated from his wife, Linda 
Hodges, and their daughter for more than three years. But authorities and 
acquaintances said his daughter's death and the breakup of his marriage had 
left Mann severely distraught. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'He Loved Sara' 
</P>
<P>
"He led an unhappy, troubled life, and he loved Sara," Hodges said. "It is hard 
on all of us, maybe it was just too hard for Wally. Maybe he couldn't go on 
without her or maybe he wanted to be closer to her. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sad that there is so much pain and so much anguish. And now there is 
more." 
</P>
<P>
Mann was found slumped across the grave at 7 a.m. when a cemetery worker 
turning on water sprinklers saw the body but thought the man was merely asleep. 
When the worker attempted to rouse him, he realized that Mann was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Around the body were several wilted roses and other flowers, apparently left by 
previous visitors to the grave. There also was a note that Mann had written. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a little note that said 'I love you' and other things," said Dean 
Sebree, a county coroner's office investigator. "It's a little bit rambling, 
but there's nothing that says, 'I am going to commit suicide,' and it didn't 
name the girl. It says he cared deeply for her, words to that effect." 
</P>
<P>
Mann lived with a sister and brother-in-law in Ojai where, Hodges said, a 
second note was found. The note more specifically detailed his grief about his 
separation from his family and the death of Sara. 
</P>
<P>
A 14-year-old boy has been charged with killing the girl and hiding her body 
for three days in his home behind a bed. 
</P>
<P>
According to Hodges, the second note said "when they took away the visitation 
rights, they took half my life. When he killed her, he took away the other 
half." 
</P>
<P>
Mann's sister and brother-in-law could not be reached for comment. And 
authorities could not confirm that a second note had been found. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wide Attention 
</P>
<P>
Mann's death was the latest turn in a case that received wide attention in the 
Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Sara was reported missing by her family March 23 after she disappeared while 
playing near her home on Alderbrook Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies conducted a brief house-to-house search in the area. The 
Sheriff's Department later organized searches, involving several local 
residents, of the undeveloped areas near the girl's home. 
</P>
<P>
She was not found until a woman living five doors from Sara's house 
investigated a bad odor in her house and found the girl's body in the bedroom 
of a 14-year-old guest, Curtis Cooper. He is awaiting trial in Juvenile Court 
on murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
The death of the little blonde girl touched the community. Nearly 100 people 
attended her funeral and community members contributed $30,000 to her family. 
Hodges later said she and her other daughter, Tisha Gates, 16, would donate the 
money to a program for children with behavioral problems. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges said Mann had not been in contact with Sara in recent years because 
Hodges had obtained a court order barring his visits. Hodges said she left her 
husband because he was emotionally unstable. She said his problems were rooted 
in his childhood, during which he said he had been abused. But she declined to 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
She said she believed "it was best for the kids" to be away from him. "I knew 
he loved Sara very much, but some loves are harmful," she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Devout Christian 
</P>
<P>
In the years after they separated, Hodges said, Mann became a devout Christian 
and contacted her periodically and requested to see his daughter. Though she 
said that in recent months Mann had been working for his brother-in-law, it was 
unclear what he did. 
</P>
<P>
Though separated from Mann for about four years, Hodges said, she did not move 
to finalize the divorce until recently. She said the divorce was expected to be 
granted this month and may already have been concluded. That may have 
contributed to Mann's sense of loss, Hodges said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said legal papers regarding the couple's divorce were found in 
Mann's car at the cemetery, but they did not know if the divorce was completed 
or if the papers contributed to his death.

JURY TOLD OF LUCAS RAGE AT WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A psychologist who examined convicted killer David Lucas told jurors Tuesday 
that Lucas harbors "a great rage" toward women. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Alvin Marks testified as a defense witness for Lucas, 34, whose attorneys 
are trying to persuade a jury to recommend a life sentence without possibility 
of parole rather than the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas of Spring Valley was convicted June 21 of three throat-slashing murders 
-- of two women and a child -- and of the attempted murder of another woman. 
</P>
<P>
Marks said Lucas' is ambivalent toward women and "loved them and hated them." 
</P>
<P>
He said Lucas' father, Clarence Lucas, had a "total contempt . . . for women" 
and cited instances where his father mistreated Lucas as a boy. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas' 16-year-old niece, Trisha Graves, urged jurors to spare his life. She 
said Lucas "has done a lot for me." 
</P>
<P>
Lucas was convicted of killing USD student Anne Swanke, 22, on Nov. 20, 1984, 
as well as Suzanne Jacobs, 31, and Colin Jacobs, 3, both on May 4, 1979, in 
their Normal Heights home. 
</P>
<P>
The same jury acquitted Lucas of a 1981 killing. The jury stalemated, 11 to 1 
for conviction, in two 1984 Lakeside Killings. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Superior Court Judge Laura Hammes told jurors that they may have 
final arguments in the penalty phase on Thursday.

STATE RUNS OUT OF FUNDS FOR TESTING WELLS NEAR TOXIC DUMPING AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAYERENE BARKER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The State Water Quality Resources Board said Tuesday it has run out of money to 
test pollution levels in private wells near a Santa Clarita Valley defense 
plant that illegally dumped toxic chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Board representative Tom Bell said that after this month, Los Angeles County 
should take over testing of 15 wells near the site of the Space Ordnance 
Systems plant in Agua Dulce's Mint Canyon. Bell made the remarks to a committee 
established by the Board of Supervisors in 1986 to oversee state-ordered 
removal of toxic materials at the plant and at a second SOS facility in Sand 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clarita City Councilwoman JoAnne Darcy, a field deputy for Los Angeles 
County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, said afterward that testing at Mint Canyon 
"will continue, whether it be by the state or the county." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Faith in State 
</P>
<P>
But Agua Dulce residents, worried that toxic chemicals from the plant might 
taint drinking water, said at the meeting they have more faith in the state 
agency than in the county. Committee member Karol Roff of Agua Dulce said 
county officials were responsible for the testing during a brief period about 
three years ago. She said the county cited lab error whenever anything was 
amiss in the water. 
</P>
<P>
The monitoring committee met Tuesday to discuss the effect of the planned 
closure of the Mint Canyon plant July 16. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, a committee member, said the state has been testing private wells at the 
Mint Canyon site since 1984, when health and law-enforcement agencies raided 
SOS and found widespread evidence of illegal dumping and storage of solvents 
and chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Bell said, tests have uncovered no significant pollutants in 
private well water. "We have no indication that contamination" from the defense 
plant has reached the wells, he said. 
</P>
<P>
However, residents said trace elements of methyl ethel ketone and carbon 
tetrachloride were found in one well during February testing. 
</P>
<P>
Bell confirmed that those chemicals had been found in levels below state and 
federal safety standards. He said the state intended to retest that well this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$6,000 a Year 
</P>
<P>
Bell said the state has spent about $6,000 a year on the testing for the last 
five years and recently "just ran out of money" for the Agua Dulce site. He 
said state officials had decided the money would be better spent in other 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of priority," Bell said. "We want the county to pick up the 
load." 
</P>
<P>
But, he added, "We're not going to just walk away." He said the state would 
continue to review test results. 
</P>
<P>
Darcy, chairman of the monitoring committee, said the county possibly could 
contract with the state to test the wells. She said she believes that SOS 
officials will reimburse the state for the testing. 
</P>
<P>
SOS officials would not comment on the proposal because of pending court action 
in which the company's landlord, Allied-Signal, is challenging its obligation 
to pay for cleanup and testing at the Mint Canyon site. 
</P>
<P>
Roff said residents are concerned that toxic chemicals from the defense plant 
will seep into the wells that supply their drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to see the tests done once a month," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see the state continue," said resident Patti Martin. 
</P>
<P>
Roff added that residents who live downhill from the defense plant "don't know 
what the hell is going on." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Testing Complete 
</P>
<P>
Rita Garasi, who represents Sand Canyon on the committee, said the situation is 
very different at the plant near her home. She said the community has seen "a 
very professional cleanup with fine soil testing. We're completely satisfied." 
Testing at that facility is complete. 
</P>
<P>
Garasi said that the Allied-Signal court action has delayed cleanup at the Mint 
Canyon site. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanup of the two SOS facilities came under further public scrutiny last month 
after the Newhall Signal published an article in which members of a Sand Canyon 
family charged that SOS was responsible for four deaths in the family since 
1983. Three of the deaths were caused by leukemia. The fourth was caused by 
kidney cancer. State officials have said there is no evidence that the deaths 
were linked to contamination at SOS. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said a meeting on the health implications of the toxic chemicals is 
tentatively scheduled for the first week in August.

AROUND THE VALLEY: THE TRICK TO SELLING YOUR BLOOD, HANK SAID, IS TO ARRIVE 
EARLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE PADILLA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twice a week, Hank catches the bus from Arleta to Van Nuys to sell his blood. 
</P>
<P>
Out of work and out of luck, Hank has made his body his currency, earning $12 
for each pint of plasma he gives up. "Twelve dollars is nothing to sneeze at," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
So on a cloudy morning Hank and two other men waited patiently outside a 
defunct dentist's office converted into a plasma center, the industry's name 
for private blood banks that pay people to open their veins to earn a little 
cash. The center would not open for 25 minutes. The two men -- one in his 30s 
with bleached-blond hair and a sunburnt face, the other a portly gentleman in a 
straw hat -- hunched down by the locked office door. Hank stood on the 
sidewalk, staring at traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The trick to selling your blood, Hank said, is to arrive early. There are forms 
to fill out, and there's always a line. "If you come late, there's a long wait. 
It takes two hours if you're late." He had not yet eaten that day. He wouldn't 
for hours. 
</P>
<P>
A pawnshop is a short walk down Van Nuys Boulevard, but the men who gathered 
this morning at the plasma center -- and at centers throughout Los Angeles -- 
chose to barter in fluids and cells, not rings and watches. Perhaps their blood 
is all they have left. 
</P>
<P>
For Hank -- he wants to be known only as Hank -- the $24 he earns each week at 
the plasma center supplements his savings, his only source of income. He was 
laid off from his job at a warehouse six months ago and lives in a small 
apartment in Arleta. He can't find work. 
</P>
<P>
"Put in applications, but it's kind of tough right now," he said. Part of the 
problem, he admits, is his age. He's 54. "That goes against you in looking for 
a job." 
</P>
<P>
He discovered the plasma center by accident while passing through the 
neighborhood. "I just saw it here," Hank said. "It seemed kind of reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
This particular center pays $12 for plasma, $15 for whole blood. Plasma is the 
pale, amber-colored fluid of the blood that carries red cells through the body. 
After the plasma centers draw a donor's blood, they separate the red cells from 
the plasma and then pump the cells back into the bloodstream. The plasma is 
often used to produce pharmaceuticals, and even the Red Cross admits some drugs 
would be in short supply if commercial blood banks did not conduct their daily 
harvests. 
</P>
<P>
It's better to sell your plasma, the experienced donors say, because plasma 
donors are allowed two visits a week. The body replenishes its plasma supply in 
24 hours. Red cells, maybe because they work harder, take longer. Under federal 
guidelines, whole blood may be donated only every 56 days. 
</P>
<P>
Hank did not talk with the other men waiting for the plasma center's doors to 
open. He just stood there, a vacant expression on his face. A thin man with a 
few days of gray stubble on his chin, he wore a short-sleeved madras shirt, 
untucked, and light blue pants. A white corduroy baseball cap hid his hair. 
Above the bill, stitched in blue thread, were the words "Santa Anita Race 
Track," embroidered in incongruously cheerful lettering. 
</P>
<P>
Hank doesn't know when, or if, he'll land a job. "It's rough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the donors are down on their luck. Or at least they won't say so. The 
sunburnt man said he visits the plasma center twice a week just to earn "a 
little extra spending money." He has a job, working in the shipping and 
receiving department of a firm that bills itself as the "nation's largest 
manufacturer of maternity clothing." 
</P>
<P>
The sunburnt man laughed at his employer's claim to fame. If he's to be 
believed, they apparently can make anything. "Ever see a 44-G bra?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
What? 
</P>
<P>
"Forty-four-G," he said again with a chuckle, envisioning an immense 
double-cupped parachute. "You could probably jump out of an airplane with that 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
His joking seemed out of place, unsettling as someone gabbing in church. 
Silence was more appropriate. Silence spared the donors from having to talk 
about the tricks of fate that had brought them there to sell their blood. 
</P>
<P>
By now, two more men had joined the scene, but they, like Hank, just stood 
silently. Cars and trucks whizzed past. The sunburnt man talked about selling 
blood as if it were a hobby, like gardening or collecting stamps. "I work in 
the evenings and don't have anything to do in the day," he said. Isn't it 
depressing selling your blood? Not at all, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He discovered blood banks in December under less carefree circumstances. "I 
spent all my gambling money in Reno," he said. He was stranded. A pint of blood 
helped him make it home. 
</P>
<P>
The money is not important, he said. Maybe his blood will save a hemophiliac's 
life. Maybe science, armed with his plasma, will create a new wonder drug. 
Maybe his blood, rushed to the operating room, will save the victim of a car 
crash. He smiled at the thought. He didn't seem to know that, by law, hospitals 
may use blood from commercial banks only if donated blood is not available. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not really just the spending money," he said. "I get a pretty good 
feeling out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, about 8:30 a.m., the plasma center opened for business and the donors 
quickly but politely filed through the door. The sunburnt man, seeing he was 
being left behind, hurried to catch up. "Well, it's time for me to sign up," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hank was already at the counter, waiting to fill out a form.

'PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES' CITED AFTER CONTROVERSIAL SERIES

<P>
Chuck Cook, the editor hired a year ago to run the Newhall Signal, was fired 
Tuesday because of what both sides called "philosophical differences" with the 
newspaper's management following a controversial series of articles on 
industrial pollution. 
</P>
<P>
Signal General Manager Sammee Zeile said Cook, 44, would leave the newspaper 
today but remain with Morris Newspapers Corp., the Signal's owner, long enough 
to complete a special project on education. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some philosophical differences about what a community newspaper 
should be and about his obligations to the community," said Zeile, who 
announced Cook's departure at a staff meeting Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Cook also said his dismissal was the result of "philosophical differences." 
</P>
<P>
Community sources, who asked not to be identified, said a committee of 
community leaders had asked for Cook's dismissal because of his handling of a 
series of articles about the cleanup of toxic chemicals at Space Ordinance 
Systems facilities in Sand and Mint canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Zeile denied that. She said, however, that the SOS series "kind of goes along 
with the philosophical differences." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Link Alleged 
</P>
<P>
In one of the SOS articles, members of a Sand Canyon family charged that there 
was a link between the contamination by the defense contractor and five deaths 
in that family. Cook later wrote in an editorial that a committee monitoring 
cleanup of two SOS plants was weighted "heavily in favor of the polluters and 
against the health concerns of residents." 
</P>
<P>
He wrote that it was a shame that community leaders such as Santa Clarita Mayor 
Pro Tem Jo Anne Darcy, who also is Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich's field deputy, and Planning Commissioner Rita Garasi "would be part 
of such a sham." 
</P>
<P>
Darcy and Councilman Howard P. (Buck) McKeon, said that they had complained to 
the paper's management about Cook's running of the newspaper but denied asking 
for his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
"I know I complained about him," McKeon said. "I had some real problems with 
this SOS story. It was overly sensationalized. . . . It was definitely 
overkill. This is not what you're looking for in a small-town newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
He called Cook's allegations against Darcy, Garasi and Mayor Jan Heidt, who 
also was named in one of the paper's SOS articles, "cheap shots." McKeon said 
he arranged a meeting between Signal Publisher Darrel Phillips and members of 
the committee who were upset by the allegations. Phillips was unavailable for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
"The trend of the editorials and the staff reporting indicated that there was a 
cover-up and that we, the committee that worked on these things, were either 
too naive or too stupid or in the pocket of the polluters -- which was 
blatantly false," Darcy said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allegation Denied 
</P>
<P>
Cook denied that he implied the committee had covered up the health problems 
and defended the paper's coverage of the SOS situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Our reporters have done an exceptional job," he said. "It was a very critical 
issue where public health and safety are at stake. . . . There never was any 
allegation of a cover-up. The committee has apparently done a very good job on 
seeing that the toxic situation has been cleaned up, but our stories focused on 
a lack of knowledge about the health effects." 
</P>
<P>
Cook, who specializes in investigative reporting, was hired to lead the Signal 
after the departure of Scott Newhall and his wife, Ruth, in July, 1988, in a 
dispute over stock ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Cook also has worked for the Orange County Register, Arizona Republic and Los 
Angeles Herald Examiner. In 1988, he was a Pulitzer prize finalist for a series 
of articles for the Arizona Republic on drugs and the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Zeile credited Cook with turning the Signal from a newspaper that published 
three days a week into a daily with 44,000 circulation. "Certainly, Mr. Cook 
has been an asset to this paper," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Zeile said City Editor Joe Franco, 26, will serve as interim editor. 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Philipp Gollner contributed to this article.

MORNING BRIEFING: THIS COUNTERATTACK SUCCEEDS WITH RELISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angel Manager Doug Rader was playing third base for the Houston Astros the time 
in San Diego when Padre owner Ray Kroc grabbed the stadium microphone in 
mid-game and apologized to the fans for his team's poor play. 
</P>
<P>
"After the game," writes Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe, "Rader tried to 
explain the plight of the Padre players and said that this wasn't like 
McDonald's, where Kroc could fire the short-order cook and start over. 
</P>
<P>
"The comment enraged short-order cooks everywhere, and when the Astros came 
back to San Diego they had Chef Night. Everybody who came to the park wearing a 
chef's hat got a break, and they hooted Rader. 
</P>
<P>
"Rader got the clubhouse kid to find him a chef's hat and utensils, and he came 
out with the lineup card flipping burgers." 
</P>
<P>
Just asking: Everybody seems to assume that Shoeless Joe Jackson would be in 
the Hall of Fame were it not for the Black Sox Scandal, but does he have the 
credentials? 
</P>
<P>
He was quite a hitter, attested by his .356 lifetime average, but only once did 
he drive in more than 100 runs. His only league-leading totals were in triples, 
three times, and in doubles and hits, once each. 
</P>
<P>
Hal Trosky knocked in more than 100 runs six consecutive seasons, including a 
league-leading 162 in 1936, and he's not in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What two men hit 50 or more home runs in a season and didn't win 
the league title? 
</P>
<P>
Plot thickens: According to the Sporting News, the Pete Rose investigation has 
uncovered some extramarital indiscretions by the Cincinnati manager, who is 
said to have "five or six girlfriends around the country." 
</P>
<P>
Furman Bisher of the Atlanta Journal quotes Rose's first wife, Karolyn, as 
saying to a friend, "Between his gambling and his women, he'll be broke by the 
time he's out of baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Send roses: From Tom Powers of the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch: "Injury of 
the week: Atlanta Braves coach Bobby Wine broke two fingers as well as a bone 
in his hand demonstrating a bunt in the batting cage against a pitching 
machine. There are no plans for an instructional movie to be made." 
</P>
<P>
Stay tuned: Yes, the Jerry Reinsdorf who uncoupled Doug Collins as coach of the 
Chicago Bulls is the same one who, in concert with Eddie Einhorn, cut adrift 
Roland Hemond and Tony La Russa as general manager and manager of the Chicago 
White Sox after the 1985 season. Ken Harrelson replaced Hemond, and the White 
Sox still haven't recovered. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hemond at Baltimore and La Russa at Oakland are both doing 
handsomely. 
</P>
<P>
Squeeze play: Former major league outfielder Curt Flood, on old-timers' games: 
"The funny thing about these uniforms is you hang them in the closet and they 
get smaller and smaller." 
</P>
<P>
Frightening: Chris Evert, on Steffi Graf: "The best is yet to come with her. 
She's probably the best I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Would-you-believe-it dept.: Nick Peters of the Sacramento Bee, on Mike 
Schmidt's struggle at the plate before he retired: "It got so bad that Schmidt 
virtually begged for hits. Sadly, his last hit was a bunt single against the 
Dodgers on May 25. When an error was charged on a ball he hit in L.A., he later 
called the press box to request a reversal." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Jimmie Foxx with 50 in 1938, second to Hank Greenberg's 58, and 
Mickey Mantle with 54 in 1961, second to Roger Maris' 61. 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: Baseball Commissioner Bart Giammati, asked if he's feeling the 
pressure of the Pete Rose affair: "Yes, but it doesn't compare to having a 
thousand students marching in your front yard and you're worried about the 
safety of you and your family. That happened when I was president of Yale."

LEMOND LOSES LEAD TO FIGNON IN PYRENEES

SUPERBAGNERES, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greg LeMond of Minneapolis lost the yellow leader's jersey in the Tour de 
France Tuesday when two-time winner Laurent Fignon of France moved into the 
overall lead. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Millar of Britain won the 10th stage, which covered 85 miles from 
Cauterets to Superbagneres. Last year's champion, Pedro Delgado of Spain, was 
second with Charly Mottet of France third. 
</P>
<P>
LeMond, who entered the ride up and down four mountains in the Pyrenees five 
seconds ahead of Fignon, fell into second place, seven seconds back. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Fignon has worn the yellow jersey since winning the Tour 
in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to take the yellow jersey because I have to behave like the leader 
anyway," he said. "LeMond just won't take any risks." 
</P>
<P>
LeMond, who won in 1986, said he thought Fignon made a tactical mistake in not 
chasing Delgado earlier. 
</P>
<P>
"Delgado is the man to beat, not me," LeMond said. "Fignon wanted me to take 
the lead. But I can't do it. I'm not stupid enough to fall into that trap." 
</P>
<P>
LeMond, the only American to win this race, finished 3 minutes 26 seconds 
behind Millar. LeMond tried to stay with Fignon, the Tour de France winner in 
1983 and 1984, but he fell back in the closing climb and lost the lead he held 
since last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"On the last hill I decided to attack," Fignon said. "I didn't feel good until 
that last climb. In the other three I had trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Stephen Roche of Ireland, the 1987 winner, was forced to drop out with a thigh 
injury before the start of Tuesday's stage. 
</P>
<P>
Delgado climbed back into the race with his second-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
Nine days ago, the Spaniard was 198th and last, nearly 10 minutes off the lead 
and with no apparent chance of retaining his title. 
</P>
<P>
But by finishing second in the same time as Millar -- 4 hours 22 minutes 19 
seconds -- Delgado sliced more than three minutes off the advantage held by 
LeMond and Fignon. 
</P>
<P>
He moved into fourth place overall, 2 minutes 53 seconds behind Fignon, and 
improved his chances considerably with all the Alpine stages to come. 
</P>
<P>
Delgado broke away from the main pack much earlier than expected, attacking on 
the descent from the imposing 6,900-foot Col du Tourmalet, to catch Millar and 
Mottet, who opened a gap on the climb. 
</P>
<P>
They opened a lead of almost five minutes on the main group, including Fignon 
and LeMond. About a mile from the finish, Delgado made another move, leaving 
Mottet. 
</P>
<P>
Millar hung on to finish a second ahead.

FAILURE OF FLOODGATES TO AFFECT STOCKING OF INYO, MONO LAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Pete Thomas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Floodgates that control the water at the Department of Fish and Game's Black 
Rock Hatchery in Mono County failed June 28, killing about 10 tons of 
catchable-size rainbow trout, officials announced last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
According to Keith Anderson, the DFG's Inland Fisheries Supervisor for Southern 
California, the floodgates gave out, creating a disturbance in the raceways 
containing the fish. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, there will be a 10% reduction in the stocking of Inyo and Mono 
lakes and streams for the remainder of the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be stocking the same areas as planned, but with less fish," Anderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The DFG plans to issue a report on the incident next week. 
</P>
<P>
A 165-foot ex-Coast Guard cutter will become Southern California's newest 
artificial reef when it is sunk next Wednesday about 1 1/2 miles off the coast 
of Mission Bay in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The ship will become part of the "15-fathom fleet" of scuttled barges and other 
ships comprising what the Department of Fish and Game calls one of the most 
unusual artificial reefs in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The DFG has been involved in an ongoing program of utilizing such reefs to 
enhance fishing and diving in local waters. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 100 deer hunters will be allowed access to 3,800 acres of Trust for 
Public Land property in northwest Mendocino County when deer-hunting season 
opens in Zone A. 
</P>
<P>
Access permits will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis and allow 
hunting for deer with archery equipment and firearms. No cost is involved. Last 
year, 87 of 100 available permits were issued to Zone A deer tag holders. 
</P>
<P>
To apply, hunters should send a postcard with their name, return mailing 
address, current hunting license number and Zone A deer tag number to: State 
Department of Fish and Game, P.O. Box 47, Yountville, Calif., 94599. 
</P>
<P>
All permit holders will be given a map of the area showing boundary lines, 
access points and camping sites. 
</P>
<P>
The archery deer-hunting season for Zone A opened last Saturday and runs 
through the end of the month. General deer-hunting season begins Aug. 12 and 
ends Sept. 24. No more than two bucks, forked horn or better, may be taken by 
hunters during the Zone A season. 
</P>
<P>
Today is the grand opening of the Pachmayr International Shooting Sports Park 
at the Whittier Narrows Dam and Recreation Area in El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor Pete Schabarum will shoot the first clay target at what is 
described as "the premier facility for shooting sports enthusiasts to practice 
trap, skeet, archery and Starshot." 
</P>
<P>
Starshot, a 42-foot-tall, semicircular, orange structure, is a new clay target 
shooting game. 
</P>
<P>
Other facilities at the park include 14 American trap fields, eight skeet 
fields, a 22-target archery practice range and two roving field archery 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
The park will be open every day from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Cabo San Lucas fishing: Green water is still making for poor fishing, with 
boats having to travel 10 miles south to reach the more productive blue water, 
where dorado to 50 pounds and an occasional striped marlin are comprising most 
catches. 
</P>
<P>
According to Didier Van Der Veecken, an International Game Fish Assn. 
representative at the Solmar Hotel, there have been several sightings of blue 
marlin in the area, but the prized fish have been inactive. 
</P>
<P>
One bright spot in the colder green water -- in the low 70s -- slightly off the 
cape has been the showing of swordfish, with most in the 50- to 80-pound range 
with one reported at 244 pounds, and small yellowfin tuna. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Denholm of Corona del Mar reportedly caught the season's first striped 
marlin in local waters on June 30, but because he tagged-and-released the fish 
he estimated at 225 pounds, the official weigh-in of the season's first marlin 
at San Diego, Avalon or Balboa Island has yet to take place. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Marlin Club reports colder-than-normal water around the local 
islands and that there have been very few sightings, but no hookups. 
</P>
<P>
Balboa Angling Club says that one marlin was hooked and lost at the 209-fathom 
spot, while a spokesman at Avalon weigh station said off-color water and bad 
conditions in general are making for a poor start to the 1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
The Fourth of July weekend typically marks the beginning of marlin fishing off 
the Southern California coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Denholm reported that his fish was caught about four miles east of Santa 
Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
Calendar

CROWDED FIELD BATTLING FOR BERTHS IN DISTRICT 20 PLAYOFF CONFIGURATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By STEVE ELLING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talk about calculator overload. There are more variables involved in trying to 
sort out the District 20 playoff picture than there are in desk-top cold 
fusion. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the final week of regular-season play, only eight of the 19 teams in 
the district have been mathematically eliminated from the playoffs, according 
to Commissioner Mel Swerdling. 
</P>
<P>
The top two teams in each of the three divisions qualify, along with two 
wild-card teams. Woodland Hills West (18-3 in district play) and Newhall-Saugus 
(16-3) have sewn up the Western and Northern titles, respectively, and 
Lancaster (12-7) has clinched second in the Northern Division. 
</P>
<P>
In the Eastern Division, Panorama City is in first place at 15-4, followed by 
Sun Valley at 12-7. Gunning for second place or a wild-card berth are Glendale 
and Burbank (both 10-8) and Van Nuys-Notre Dame (8-10). 
</P>
<P>
In the Western Division, Woodland Hills East (11-7), Encino-Crespi (10-8) and 
Reseda (10-9) could conceivably finish second or earn wild-card berths. 
</P>
<P>
No such logjam exists in District 16 where Westlake-Agoura is 11-0 in district 
play with six games remaining and can clinch the title this week. The District 
16 regular-season champion and runner-up and the District 20 playoff winner 
advance to the 6th Area playoffs, July 27-30 at Birmingham High. STEVE ELLING

BAYLESS AGAIN ALL BUSINESS ABOUT GOLF CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rich Tosches 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Regan Bayless, former Pepperdine golfer and the men's Los Angeles City champion 
in 1984, chokes. 
</P>
<P>
It's not golf that makes him choke, however. What is making him choke is a 
narrow, four-foot long piece of cloth that he is required to wrap around his 
neck each morning and tie into a knot against his windpipe. 
</P>
<P>
Bayless sells real estate. But he has no interest, really, in the 3 bdrm/2 ba 
variety. His intertest in real estate runs more along the lines of which club 
he's going to need to carry a golf ball over it. The only view to widen the 
eyes of this real estate salesman is a three-foot, uphill putt for birdie. 
</P>
<P>
He once had dreams of playing golf for a living, dreams that became much more 
vivid after winning the L. A. City title at the age of 18. He had just 
completed a four-year golfing career at Crespi High, during which he was 
selected as an All-American by the American Junior Golf Assn. 
</P>
<P>
But in four years at Pepperdine, he watched his golf game deteriorate until the 
dream died. 
</P>
<P>
After graduating last year, Bayless picked up a nice, shiny briefcase and 
tucked his golf bag away in the closet. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got out of Pepperdine, I decided that golf was over," said Bayless, 23, 
of Woodland Hills. "I played so poorly in college, and I didn't even know why. 
I practiced hard and played hard, but I think I lost interest in the game at 
some point. When I finished up at school last year, I realistically figured 
that I couldn't make any money playing golf like I was playing, so I got a real 
job and put the clubs away. 
</P>
<P>
"I quit completely. The clubs never moved from the closet for eight months. I 
really lost interest. I never even thought about golf. I absolutely and 
completely had given the game up." 
</P>
<P>
But in March, Bayless received an application for qualifying rounds for the 
California Amateur Championships. He had qualified for and played in the state 
amateur on the Monterey Peninsula each of the previous two years. 
</P>
<P>
"Both tournaments were so much fun," Bayless recalled. "Both times I played, it 
was just great." 
</P>
<P>
So out came the dusty clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't get to practice much before qualifying, and I didn't make it into the 
tournament," he said. "But I had played well enough in just a few weeks to get 
my interest up again." 
</P>
<P>
He began making two trips a day to a practice range. And shortly he began 
striking the ball as well as ever. Recently, Bayless has started to enter 
tournaments. And he has started to get excited about golf again. He finished 
eighth two weeks ago in the Long Beach City Amateur Championships and last 
weekend he finished second in the Oxnard City championships, rebounding from an 
opening round of 76 with a 2-under-par round of 70 the second day. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm psyched about golf again," Bayless said. "I can't wait to get to the 
course every day." 
</P>
<P>
This, of course, is starting to cause problems. Serious golf and spending eight 
hours a day in a shirt and tie tend to mix about as well as New York cab 
drivers and England's Royal Family. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough, really tough," Bayless said. "I'm playing golf now as often as I 
can. I play before work and I play after work, every day of the week. Nine 
holes early in the morning and nine more after work. I'm going to Colorado 
Springs in two weeks to play in an invitational tournament, and I haven't 
actually approached my boss about that yet. I made flight reservations already, 
so I guess I should mention it to them." 
</P>
<P>
And with the renewed interest in the game, Bayless' dream also has returned. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to keep playing a lot of golf through the summer and then see how 
far I've come," he said. "If I'm playing well enough by then, I'll consider 
turning pro. What I've found out is that the alternative can be hell. When you 
think of the next 45 years wearing a tie and working 9 to 5, golf sounds pretty 
good again."

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Right-hander Pat Bennett threw a five-hitter and was two for three with three 
runs batted in to lead Encino-Crespi to a 10-2 win over North Hollywood in an 
inter-divisional American Legion District 20 game at Valley College on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett (3-2) struck out four and walked one in the seven-inning victory, 
keeping alive his team's hopes for a playoff berth. Both runs were earned. 
</P>
<P>
Third baseman Vic Seper was three for three with two RBIs for Encino-Crespi 
(11-8). Seper, who will be a sophomore in the fall, has eight consecutive hits 
spanning three games. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Maurizi and Ed Gillis each had two hits, an RBI and scored a run for 
Encino-Crespi, which led, 5-1, after two innings and scored in five of six 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
Encino-Crespi pounded right-handers Craig White and Steve Sobisky for 12 hits, 
all singles. White, the starter, took the loss for North Hollywood (8-13).

$21.5 BILLION BID FOR HUGE BRITISH CONGLOMERATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN FISHER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An investment group headed by flamboyant takeover specialist James Goldsmith 
launched an "unsolicited and unwelcome" $21.5-billion bid Tuesday for BAT 
Industries PLC, the British conglomerate that includes American subsidiaries 
ranging from Saks Fifth Avenue to Farmers Insurance Group Inc. of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It is by far the biggest buyout ever attempted here, and London financial 
markets bet heavily Tuesday that the price may yet go high enough to rival last 
year's world record $25-billion purchase of RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis 
Roberts &amp; Co., a New York firm specializing in leveraged buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith said he intends to sell off BAT's non-tobacco interests, starting 
with the Farmers Group, which BAT acquired for $5.2 billion last Dec. 16 
following a protracted takeover battle. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers, California's second-largest and the nation's third-largest writer of 
personal lines of insurance, has 15,500 employees and another 15,000 agents and 
district managers with exclusive contracts to sell Farmers' products. The 
company's largest operation by far is in California. 
</P>
<P>
BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy promised a fight against the Goldsmith offer, 
calling it "no more than an ill-conceived attempt at destructive financial 
engineering." The company "considers this unsolicited and unwelcome offer to be 
of dubious value," according to a BAT press release, which added, "It should be 
rejected." 
</P>
<P>
An expectant British business community has been awaiting a high-stakes 
Goldsmith grab for some company ever since he announced his return to the 
London financial scene last March in partnership with his old friend, financier 
Jacob Rothschild. 
</P>
<P>
But the size of his quarry clearly stunned the City, as London's equivalent of 
the Wall Street financial district is called. 
</P>
<P>
BAT (formerly British American Tobacco) shares closed up by more than 30%, at 
906 pence (the equivalent of $14.77) a share Tuesday after trading earlier at 
as much as 940 pence ($15.32). Both figures were well above the 850 pence 
($13.86) a share offered by Goldsmith's group, indicating that the City expects 
the bidding to go higher in what analysts said is shaping up as a titanic 
battle for control. 
</P>
<P>
Also in on the deal with Goldsmith and Rothschild is Kerry Packer, a colorful 
Australian entrepreneur and owner of Consolidated Press Holdings. The three are 
the principal members of Hoylake Investments PLC, an investor group formed 
specifically to make the BAT bid. 
</P>
<P>
The bid and the associated takeover fever Tuesday sent the Financial Times' 
100-share index to a post-1987 crash high, up 55.7 points, or more than 2.5%, 
to close at 2,250.9. 
</P>
<P>
Known in the British press as "the buccaneering billionaire," Goldsmith, 56, 
has made nearly as many headlines because of his life style as he has because 
of his roller-coaster business career. 
</P>
<P>
After an early up-and-down business career, he made millions in the food 
business here and was knighted before quitting England a decade ago in despair 
over its political and economic future. 
</P>
<P>
He exported his takeover talents to the United States, where he multiplied his 
fortune in raids on Diamond International Corp., St. Regis Paper, Crown 
Zellerbach and, finally, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. But his greatest coup 
was to pull most of his assets out of the stock market just before the Black 
Monday crash in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He told a London news conference Tuesday that he had decided to return to 
Britain now because its economic prospects look "pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
He also rejected suggestions that his BAT bid was an example of 
asset-stripping, arguing that international conglomerates are a failure. He 
said BAT, which marked a watershed last year by generating more than 50% of its 
profits from non-tobacco interests for the first time, had made a mistake by 
diversifying. Goldsmith maintained that he only wants to "liberate" companies 
that have been "stifled" under the conglomerate structure. 
</P>
<P>
Hoylake's plan is to arrange bridge loans to buy BAT, then to immediately sell 
all the non-tobacco interests to pay off the debt as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith admitted that the plan entails risk but argued that "the ultimate 
risk is not taking a risk." 
</P>
<P>
BAT posted an after-tax profit equivalent to $1.55 billion on revenue of $28.8 
billion in its most recent fiscal year, which ended March 31. It is the 
third-largest publicly held British corporation, following British Petroleum 
and Shell Oil.

NOVEL RUNOFF FEE SOUGHT TO CLEAN SANTA MONICA BAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY, Times City-County Bureau Chief 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new financing plan, charging fees to homeowners and businesses for their 
pollution, was proposed by Mayor Tom Bradley on Tuesday to clean up one of the 
worst sources of Santa Monica Bay contamination -- runoff from streets, 
sidewalks, parking lots and other paved and built-over areas. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal was announced at a City Hall press conference by Bradley and other 
Los Angeles city officials. The plan was developed by city public works 
officials and aides to the mayor and Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica). 
</P>
<P>
Runoff of rain and other water polluted by street, motor vehicle and animal 
waste and other urban grime is one of the two biggest polluters of Santa Monica 
Bay, a body of water that provides recreation to hundreds of thousand of people 
each year. The other is sewage treated at the city's Hyperion plant. The 
quality of that plant's treatment, under a court order from the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, has improved sharply recently. 
</P>
<P>
Under the runoff treatment financing plan, special taxing districts would be 
created by the City Council, in which property owners would be assessed to 
finance new facilities to clean up the filthy water before it hits the bay. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said that if the City Council approved a $20-million-a-year runoff 
cleanup program the average fee per single-family home would be about $9 a 
year, with significantly higher rates for commercial and industrial landowners. 
</P>
<P>
That would be on top of an average residential sewage service charge of $125 a 
year financing a huge reconstruction and modernization of the city sewer 
system. By 1994, that charge will rise to $277 annually. 
</P>
<P>
Robert S. Horii, who heads the city Bureau of Engineering, said such facilities 
could cost "hundreds of millions" of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley said design work will begin immediately on two pilot projects aimed at 
determining the cost and effectiveness of various cleanup methods. One will be 
at Ballona Creek in Marina del Rey, the city's worst source of runoff 
pollution. The other will control runoff at Venice's Brooks Avenue drain, a big 
source of pollution at Venice Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The special taxing areas, called benefit assessment districts, have been used 
for years to put up street lighting and make other civic improvements. They do 
not require votes by affected property owners. 
</P>
<P>
What is unique about this plan, city officials said, is that the taxes would be 
levied according to the amount of asphalt or concrete, or buildings, on a 
property. Such covering prevents storm water from percolating into the soil. 
</P>
<P>
Thus owners of a building surrounded by a huge parking lot would pay more than 
one encompassed by lawn. 
</P>
<P>
And fees would be lowered if property owners found ways to reduce their runoff 
by such methods as planting patches of grass and shrubs in paved areas. These 
rewards would apply to homeowners as well as to owners of commercial property. 
</P>
<P>
"It is feasible to establish a fee structure that would provide incentive for 
property owners to design methods of water harvesting (collection and storage 
of rainwater for irrigation), greenbelts, detention basins, intensified surface 
cleaning or other techniques to inhibit flow and reduce pollution," city 
officials said in a summary of the plan presented to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Announcement of the plan followed a decision by the EPA several months ago that 
local governments would have to clean up runoff pollution. But while the EPA 
found such pollution a threat, and promised to finance research, the federal 
agency made it clear that Washington could not supply the massive amounts of 
money needed to control runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists, who have clashed with Bradley over bay pollution in the 
past, said they are pleased by the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very proud to be part of the city now," said Dorothy Green of Save the 
Bay, an organization that has led the fight to force government to clean up the 
bay. 
</P>
<P>
Catherine Tyrell, director of the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Project, said 
"it's up to us to finance" the cleanup efforts and "this seems like one 
innovative way to do it. It really seems like it would work." 
</P>
<P>
John Stodder, Bradley's top environmental aide, said the benefit assessment 
districts have financed similar cleanup projects in Bellevue, Wash., and small 
cities in Florida. But he said this is the first time such an approach has been 
proposed for a big city. 
</P>
<P>
Two members of the City Council supported the plan. They were Zev Yaroslavsky 
and Ruth Galanter, who represent Westside areas near the bay. 
</P>
<P>
But Bradley will have to muster his political skills to push the measure 
through the 15-member council. Increasing the sewer service charged passed the 
council on a bare 8-7 vote in May. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cooperation Needed 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Stodder said, cooperation will be needed from county and state 
officials for a successful runoff cleanup campaign. 
</P>
<P>
Many streets and highways, for example, are under county and state jurisdiction 
and would have to share in the cleanup costs. 
</P>
<P>
One of the pilot projects announced by the mayor would involve installation of 
an inflatable rubber dam across Ballona Creek. Water would be screened to 
remove waste and then the water would be disinfected. Officials said the 
cleansed water could be used to irrigate the nearby Ballona Wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
The other proposal would shift water from the Brooks Avenue drain in Venice, 
where it now flows directly onto the beach, into the Thornton Avenue drain, 
where it would be cleaned.

first to be raised to the British peerage -- died Tuesday at his home in 
England. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier, holder of three Academy Awards and four Emmys, had battled cancer, 
pleurisy and a muscle disease in recent years but did not announce his 
retirement until 1987. Even afterward, he continued to take on cameo roles. 
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate announcement of the cause of death. "His last few days 
were very peaceful. He died in his sleep at noon. All the family were at his 
side," said Richard Olivier, the 27-year-old son of his third marriage, to 
actress Joan Plowright. 
</P>
<P>
In Britain, the death of a national institution was marked as theaters from the 
West End to Stratford dimmed their lights and lowered flags to half-staff. 
Queen Elizabeth II sent condolences to Olivier's family at his home near 
Ashurst, a village in West Sussex about 50 miles south of London. 
</P>
<P>
Across the Atlantic, Broadway theaters also dimmed their marquee lights in 
tribute Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't too much to say that Olivier was perhaps the greatest man of the 
theater ever," said Sir Peter Hall, head of the National Theater, which Olivier 
helped to found. "Larry Olivier's genius shaped the last 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
A private funeral is planned, with a public memorial service in London later. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier was the quintessential actor, as famous for his stage work as for his 
films and for the vividness of his private life. He was, by turns: 
</P>
<P>
* The most pride-driven Heathcliff. 
</P>
<P>
* The most tortured Hamlet. 
</P>
<P>
* The most heroic Henry V. 
</P>
<P>
* The most perfidious Richard III. 
</P>
<P>
* The most tragically vain and foolish Lear. 
</P>
<P>
He was all these and more than 100 others in the course of a career that also 
included successful efforts as director and producer of plays and films, the 
rebuilding of the Old Vic Theater Company after World War II and leadership in 
creating the British National Theater. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Turbulent Marriage 
</P>
<P>
He drew a different sort of attention for his ultimately disastrous romance 
with actress Vivien Leigh, whom he married in 1940, shortly after she 
catapulted to fame as Scarlett O'Hara in "Gone With the Wind." The turbulent 
marriage -- Olivier's second -- lasted two decades. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier was the kind of performer for whom superlatives are invented . . . and 
discarded. 
</P>
<P>
He was renowned for his daring -- taking dangerous leaps about the stage and 
bold interpretations of character. "However many times you'd seen him, it was 
probably the most dangerously thrilling moment you'd seen on any stage," actor 
Jeremy Brett said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there was always at the core a sense of fun -- and of proportion to Sir 
Laurence, Baron of Brighton. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm too much of an urchin not to smile slightly at the idea of being a lord," 
he said in accepting the honor. "But this peerage confers official dignity on 
the acting profession." 
</P>
<P>
When Michael Caine dutifully and nervously greeted him as Sir Laurence at their 
first meeting during the production of "Sleuth," Olivier said, "That's fine, 
and now call me Larry, please." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sure Sense of Worth 
</P>
<P>
And while maintaining a sure sense of his own worth ("Don't tell me whether I 
was good or bad in a part -- I damn well know which it was, and I'll know it 
before anyone else") there was also a refusal to see himself, or his 
profession, as the center of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
"When you think about it," he said in a 1980 interview, "what is acting but 
lying? When I was small I lied all the time. . . . I like to think I was just 
practicing my profession. But really I was just being a bloody liar." 
</P>
<P>
It was a typical childhood memory for Olivier, who recalled that part of his 
life as a "mitigated horror, based mostly on being afraid of my father." 
</P>
<P>
Laurence Kerr Olivier was born May 22, 1907, in Dorking, Surrey, England. He 
was the third child and second son of the Rev. Gerard Kerr Olivier, an 
Anglo-Catholic clergyman who preached with a theatrical flair that the actor 
later credited with helping to decide the course of his life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sister's Description 
</P>
<P>
Olivier's sister, Sybille, described the parson's wrath as "a storming, raging 
tornado which he'd turn on Larry in a way he never did on our brother Dickie 
and me." 
</P>
<P>
But the situation was, as Olivier said, mitigated; his mother, Agnes Crookenden 
Olivier, became the center of his childish world. It was her sense of joy and 
gift of laughter that he said later enabled him to find elements of humor even 
in so tragic a figure as King Lear. 
</P>
<P>
Though he recalled beginning his acting career on a stage he had made from a 
packing crate when he was 5 years old, Olivier said his first real training 
came at a 14-pupil choir school affiliated with the Church of All Saints in 
London, where he came under the influence of Geoffrey Heald, a priest devoted 
to the theater who directed plays as well as conducting the choir. 
</P>
<P>
He played several parts in Heald's plays, but it was his characterization of 
Brutus in "Julius Caesar" that caused one member of the audience -- actress 
Ellen Terry -- to write in her diary, "The small boy who played Brutus is 
already a great actor." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Serious Thought 
</P>
<P>
All the same, Olivier said he gave no serious thought to an acting career. He 
expected his father to order him into the ministry. 
</P>
<P>
But here, his father surprised him. 
</P>
<P>
Confronted by young Laurence's halfhearted plea that he be permitted to follow 
his brother to India, the elder Olivier drew himself up to his full height, 
snorted, and roared: 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be an ass! You're going on the stage." 
</P>
<P>
Thunderstruck and overjoyed, Olivier recalled, he applied forthwith for a 
scholarship ("It had to be that; the Olivier family's poverty was genteel, but 
very real") to the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art. 
</P>
<P>
There, he said, famed dramatic teacher Elsie Fogerty criticized his hairline, 
gait, eye position, nose, chin, posture, speech, gestures and intentions -- but 
granted him, in addition to full tuition for a year, a small stipend to meet 
living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Between terms, he worked as a stage manager and general understudy at the St. 
Christopher Theater in Lechworth, where he made his professional acting debut 
as Lennox in "Macbeth" during Easter holidays in 1925. 
</P>
<P>
On graduating, he was presented a cup as best actor in the school. But neither 
the cup nor the professional debut seemed to carry much weight when he emerged 
for his first season -- and began to pay the dues the English theater 
traditionally exacts from beginners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gained Bit Parts 
</P>
<P>
From walk-ons he progressed to bit parts in the provinces and then a minor role 
in an experimental play in London. 
</P>
<P>
His performance as Malcolm in a modern-dress version of "Macbeth" earned 
Olivier his first real notice, and he followed with the lead in Tennyson's 
verse drama "Harold" and other roles. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
String of Disasters 
</P>
<P>
Olivier's first lead part in a major production was "Beau Geste." It closed in 
disaster, and so did the next five plays in which he appeared. 
</P>
<P>
"So you can imagine my frame of mind when a relative unknown, Noel Coward, came 
to me with a proposal that I join him and Gertrude Lawrence in something he'd 
written called 'Private Lives.' 
</P>
<P>
"I turned him down flat!" 
</P>
<P>
However, Coward proved as good a salesman as he was an actor and playwright. A 
day of practically nonstop argument finally persuaded Olivier to change his 
mind. "Private Lives" opened in London to rave reviews, set box office records, 
and continued its winning ways when it was transplanted to New York. 
</P>
<P>
More success was to come in "Rats of Norway," "The Green Bay Tree" and "Queen 
of Scots," among others. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in the fall of 1935, "Romeo and Juliet" opened with Olivier in the lead 
and John Gielgud playing Mercutio. After seven weeks, they switched parts -- 
and kept switching back and forth to critical hosannas for the rest of the 
six-month run. 
</P>
<P>
"Overnight," Olivier said, "people could remember my name. They even began to 
ask for my autograph. It scared me half to death." 
</P>
<P>
It also, he said later, began to change the way he viewed his chosen 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Decided to Restart 
</P>
<P>
"I decided," he said, "to start life all over again -- and learn to act." 
</P>
<P>
He joined England's famed Old Vic Company and began restudying the classics. 
</P>
<P>
His first Old Vic role, "Hamlet" in 1937, startled critics and audiences alike 
with its power, and he followed with similarly effective portrayals of "Henry 
V" and "Macbeth" plus Sir Toby Belch in "Twelfth Night" and Iago in "Othello." 
</P>
<P>
"In Othello," he said, "I had come to the conclusion that Iago had a homosexual 
attraction to Othello. It explained a lot of his motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"So, to demonstrate, during a rehearsal I turned and kissed Ralph Richardson -- 
he was playing the Moor -- full on the lips. You should have seen his reaction! 
</P>
<P>
" 'There, there, my dear boy,' he said. 'Steady, now. Steady!' " 
</P>
<P>
He was, he said, well pleased with this "second start" for his life, and might 
very well simply have continued along the classical line on stage but for one 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I discovered the movies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, he had discovered them a long time before -- in 1927, when he made 
his film debut for Paramount in "Too Many Crooks" -- but until 1939 he 
considered them merely a way to make enough money to live well while pursuing 
"important" work on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"I was frightfully snobbish," he said. "And whereas it didn't seem to matter 
much in films like 'Perfect Understanding' and 'No Funny Business,' and 'The 
Divorce of Lady X,' all of which I made during the '30s, that attitude almost 
ruined me in 'Wuthering Heights.' " 
</P>
<P>
William Wyler, directing the film, was deeply depressed by early scenes, and 
there was even talk of shutting down production to recast the role. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feeling Superior 
</P>
<P>
"But Wyler took me in hand and made me look at what I was doing," Olivier said. 
"I could see it, up there on the screen. I was feeling superior to the medium 
-- and it was making me inferior." 
</P>
<P>
Olivier returned to the sound stages for retakes and began to listen to Wyler's 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
The result was his first nomination for an Academy Award. 
</P>
<P>
"Not to mention a whole new appreciation of the possibilities of film as an art 
form, something I had never considered before. I began to wonder about doing 
Shakespeare on film. It had been tried before -- with disastrous results. But 
still. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Other events, however, postponed Olivier's planning. 
</P>
<P>
One interruption was his first divorce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Married to Actress 
</P>
<P>
He had been married for 10 years to actress Jill Esmond; they had one son, 
Simon Tarquin. And now the marriage was over. Press and public made the usual 
noises of condolence and vague disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
But the noises built to a crescendo a few days later when he was married to 
Leigh. 
</P>
<P>
The fame of the couple (Olivier had picked up a second Oscar nomination for his 
performance in "Rebecca") and their personal attractiveness were more than 
sufficient for millions upon millions of printed and spoken words. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd have thought they had better things to write about, that year," Olivier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"That year" was 1940, and one of the things Olivier, personally, was thinking 
about was his homeland, where World War II had taken a nearly catastrophic 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Goes Home to Fight 
</P>
<P>
Olivier lingered in the United States long enough to appear with Katharine 
Cornell in the critically acclaimed "No Time for Comedy" and with his new wife 
in a critically deplored "Romeo and Juliet," and then went home to fight. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier was commissioned and designated a second-line pilot in the Fleet Air 
Arm, but he was denied any combat role -- and so was amenable when it was 
suggested that he make radio broadcasts and films boosting morale and enlisting 
worldwide sympathy for the Allied cause. 
</P>
<P>
And then came "Henry V." 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted," he said "to speak of British determination and heroes. Henry V 
seemed the best answer. But, how to get it onto film? Shakespeare had, thus 
far, defied all efforts at film translation." 
</P>
<P>
The answer was a classic. Olivier's solution to the problem of easing an 
audience into the rhythms of Shakespeare was to start the film on an 
Elizabethan stage, as though it were actually a performance at the Globe 
Theater -- but to then move to full movie treatment and freedom for most of the 
play, not returning to the "reality" of the stage until the final curtain 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Memorable Scene 
</P>
<P>
This afforded the opportunity, among other things, to show combat on horseback 
rather than afoot as in stage productions, and gave Olivier one of his more 
memorable scenes. 
</P>
<P>
"Once more into the breach!" the king exhorts his men, waving his sword from 
the back of a gray gelding known as Blaunchkyng: "Cry, 'God for Harry, England 
and St. Geo-o-o-o-rge!' " The slightly nasal voice slides up the scale of pitch 
and power as horse and man leap forward. 
</P>
<P>
"A nice touch, that," Olivier mused in later years. "All Shakespeare's, of 
course; not mine. Still -- I think he might have approved." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the public did. 
</P>
<P>
The film is still being shown around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences liked it, too, and voted him a 
special Oscar for his "outstanding achievement as actor, producer and director" 
of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier followed, in 1948, with "Hamlet," which landed him his second Oscar as 
best actor. (The film, which he produced, also won an Oscar as best of the 
year.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Returns to Stage 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he had returned to the stage. In 1944, the Old Vic Company, nearly 
dismantled and bankrupted by the war, had named him co-director. He got the 
company moving again, appearing as Button Moulder in Peer Gynt, followed by 
Sergius Saranoff in "Arms and the Man," and the duke of Gloucester in "Richard 
III." 
</P>
<P>
He was also Astrov in "Uncle Vanya," Hotspur in "Henry IV, Part I," and Justice 
Shallow in "Henry IV, Part II," as well as appearing in the title role of 
"Oedipus," which he presented on a double bill with his portrayal of Puff in 
"The Critic." 
</P>
<P>
Later, in his autobiography, Olivier gave insight into his acting methods by 
disclosing what was on his mind while he delivered Oedipus' terrible scream at 
the moment of his blinding: ermine. The trappers trick these precious animals 
by putting salt on the ice; the ermine lick the salt and their tongues become 
frozen to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
It was an exhausting schedule and raised the company to a new peak of 
popularity and prestige, but in 1949 he moved on, leaving to stage a London 
production of Tennessee Williams' "A Streetcar Named Desire," with Leigh in the 
role of Blanche du Bois. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier's long-simmering ambition to be an actor-manager in the grand tradition 
was fulfilled between 1950-57 by his introduction to London audiences of 
Christopher Fry's elegant verse comedy, "Venus Observed," Gian Carlo Menotti's 
opera "The Consul," and Australian playwright Ray Lawler's drama "Summer of the 
Seventeenth Doll." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Festival of Britain 
</P>
<P>
He also appeared with Leigh in "Caesar and Cleopatra," and "Antony and 
Cleopatra," performing the plays on alternating nights during the Festival of 
Britain and later transferring both to the Ziegfeld Theater in New York, where 
the couple also appeared in Terence Rattigan's "The Sleeping Prince." 
</P>
<P>
Returning to England, the Oliviers appeared in three more Shakespearean 
productions. But Olivier was restless and in 1957 left the classics for a time 
to create the tragic and self-centered character of Archie Rice in "The 
Entertainer," John Osborne's scalding repudiation of the social order. It was a 
daring alliance between England's leading actor and one of the country's new 
breed of "angry young men" playwrights. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier remained active in films in this period -- notably when he returned 
Shakespeare to the screen in 1956 with his sneering, malevolent -- and oddly 
attractive -- "Richard III. It was almost as well received as "Henry V" and 
"Hamlet." 
</P>
<P>
"The Prince and the Showgirl," (a screen version of "Sleeping Prince,") which 
paired him with Marilyn Monroe the following year, was a critical catastrophe 
-- though Olivier always thought the reaction somewhat unjust. 
</P>
<P>
"A fair person, looking at the performance and disregarding the personal lives 
of the players, would see it for what it was -- a competent performance by 
professionals. The trouble was, no one looked at it that way." 
</P>
<P>
He was referring not only to Monroe's problems, but to his own as well. 
</P>
<P>
The marriage to Leigh, tempestuous from the outset, had become increasingly 
unsettled with the passing years, and by the late 1950s their troubles were 
beginning to appear in print. Leigh, tiring of the marriage, had affairs with 
actor Peter Finch and others and was eventually diagnosed as suffering from 
manic depression. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Olivier refused to comment publicly. But later, after her death, 
he tried to explain. 
</P>
<P>
"You can reach a point," he told an interviewer in 1979, "where it's like a 
life raft that can only hold so many. You cast away the hand grasping it. You 
do not take it on board because otherwise, it's both of you. Two, instead of 
one." 
</P>
<P>
It was, he said, "more than my life -- I was afraid of killing her." 
</P>
<P>
"I nearly did, once. She was slapping me across the face with wet flannels . . 
. until I went into my room and closed the door. She kept beating on the door . 
. . until I couldn't take it any more. 
</P>
<P>
"I came out and grabbed her and threw her across the room. . . . I knew then it 
had ended. I had to get out." 
</P>
<P>
And so, in 1960, the Oliviers were divorced. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tells of His Fear 
</P>
<P>
His remarriage the following year -- to a much younger actress, Joan Plowright, 
was by all accounts his happiest. The couple had three children -- son Richard 
and daughters Tamsin and Julia Kate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Continued to Star 
</P>
<P>
On stage, he continued to play starring roles: Berenger in Ionesco's 
"Rhinoceros," in 1960, and both leads, at times, in Anouilh's "Becket" in New 
York and on the road the same year. 
</P>
<P>
On film, however, Olivier seemed to slip gradually toward the character and 
cameo appearance bracket with small, although highly praised, characterizations 
in "The Devil's Disciple" and "Spartacus." 
</P>
<P>
A return to top billing in a film version of "The Entertainer" brought mixed 
reviews, and a poor box office return -- and seemed to lead to a three-year 
hiatus, in which he abandoned films entirely. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, it was more a problem of timing. "There are," he said, "only 24 hours 
in most days, and I have simply got to sleep through at least five or six of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Directed Three Plays 
</P>
<P>
He had accepted the stewardship of the Chichester Festival Theater, England's 
first arena-type auditorium, in 1961, and directed three plays for the 
inaugural program in the summer of 1962 (playing a major role in one) and then 
returned to the commercial stage for the satirical comedy "Semi-Detached" in 
London before accepting the managing directorship of the new National Theater 
of Great Britain in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Though he continued as director of the Chichester until 1965, most of his 
energies were absorbed by the task of creating the National Theater -- acting 
as administrator as well as director and performer. 
</P>
<P>
His efforts were, ultimately, successful; when he finally relinquished the 
reins of the theater in 1973, his decade of management had seen the 
organization firmly established -- a highly respected and acclaimed national 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there were those who shook their heads, lamenting his expenditure of time 
and energy in the minutiae of theatrical management. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Director's Comment 
</P>
<P>
"No one," said director Tony Richardson, "should allow Larry to do anything but 
act. Few, if any, can do that so well." 
</P>
<P>
There was also a suspicion that exhaustion connected with the National Theater 
(he supervised, directed and appeared in such productions as "Othello," "The 
Merchant of Venice," "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and "The Three Sisters") 
was responsible for a series of illnesses that began to plague him during the 
1960s. 
</P>
<P>
They included cancer of the prostate, and thrombosis that, he said, swelled his 
right leg until it weighed 20 pounds more than the left, and an ailment called 
dermo-myositis, a wasting inflammation of the muscles that also renders the 
skin extremely sensitive. 
</P>
<P>
In his autobiography, "Confessions of an Actor," published in 1982, Olivier 
revealed how he also battled overpowering stage fright in the 1960s. During a 
run of "Othello" he was so terrified of reciting his soliloquies that he asked 
another actor to stand off stage to provide reassurance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Ailments, Too 
</P>
<P>
He struggled through it all ("I also had appendicitis, bronchial pneumonia and 
a couple of other little things -- enough to keep one interested"), directing 
and acting mainly for the National until 1974 and then simply "retired" from 
the theater. 
</P>
<P>
He said it was a matter of physical inability. 
</P>
<P>
"I can no longer be a stage actor," he told an interviewer in 1979, "because I 
don't feel I've got the power, the physical attributes that are absolutely 
necessary to be a very good, powerful, meaningful actor. 
</P>
<P>
"So, we have the movies. Thank God for the movies." 
</P>
<P>
His performance as the mercurial Andrew Wyke in the hit movie "Sleuth" in 1972 
had fully re-established his film career. 
</P>
<P>
"Sleuth" won him another Oscar nomination as well as the New York Film Critics' 
best-actor designation. Another Academy Award nomination came in 1976 for his 
evocation of the coldly evil dentist-torturer of "Marathon Man," and yet 
another for his characterization of a relentless tracker of German war 
criminals in "The Boys from Brazil" in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, there had been other changes in his life. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Became a Knight 
</P>
<P>
He had become Sir Laurence Olivier in 1947, the youngest of his profession ever 
to receive such an honor. But other actors had achieved knighthood. 
</P>
<P>
Olivier's honor was unique among actors, however, when Queen Elizabeth II 
created him a life peer -- Baron Olivier of Brighton -- as a reward for his 
"services to the theater" in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a third Oscar (a special one, presented in 1979 for "the full 
body of his work"), Olivier received a gold medallion from the Swedish Academy 
of Literature, was an officer of the French Legion of Honor, held honorary 
degrees from Oxford and Edinburgh universities and three Emmy awards for 
television appearances in "The Moon and Sixpence," "Long Day's Journey Into 
Night" and "Love Among the Ruins." 
</P>
<P>
More recently he played the small but powerful role of Lord Marchmain in 
"Brideshead Revisited," which brought him his fourth Emmy. 
</P>
<P>
There were also appearances in less laudable efforts: he was Gen. Douglas 
MacArthur in the disastrous "Inchon" and Van Helsing in "Dracula." 
</P>
<P>
This was balanced by his astonishing "King Lear" in which the aged actor 
carried off one of Shakespeare's most physically demanding roles with flawless 
excellence. Another man -- a lesser one, perhaps -- might have called it a day 
then, content to exit on a rising note. But Olivier carried on: "Lear" was 
closely followed by "The Ebony Tower," a television version of John Fowles' 
novel filmed mainly in France. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986 he had a small role in the British mini-series "Lost Empires" and 
published a second volume of autobiography, "On Acting. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as last year, he played a wheelchair-bound general in the British 
film "War Requiem." Numerous tributes marked Olivier's 80th birthday two years 
ago, including a retrospective of his major films, the issuance of two birthday 
books, and special radio and television broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, he made his last public performance, a tape-recorded appeal 
to preserve the remains of London's Rose Theater, where Shakespeare is believed 
to have acted, which had been unearthed during construction of an office block. 
</P>
<P>
In his later years, he was asked by an interviewer why, considering the 
precarious state of his health, he continued a strenuous work schedule. Olivier 
smiled wryly. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it won't do any more to say it's because I need the money for Joan and 
the kids, will it? 
</P>
<P>
"I mean -- they're grown, aren't they? The truth is, if I stopped work, I 
wouldn't know what to do. Can't imagine retiring -- puttering about the garden, 
that sort of thing.

MEDICARE DRUG BENEFITS PERILED BY RISING COSTS 
</P>

Cost estimates of the controversial Medicare catastrophic care program have 
risen so dramatically that Congress might have to reconsider coverage of 
prescription drugs, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The newly pessimistic appraisal of the program's cost is a dramatic reversal 
for Bentsen and will give ammunition to critics who have pushed to delay its 
implementation. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, Bentsen had said that the drug benefit fund would have excess 
revenues that could be used to reduce the surtax levied to finance catastrophic 
care. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Serious Look' Needed 
</P>
<P>
However, at a Finance Committee hearing Tuesday, Bentsen said that "a serious 
look has to be taken at the benefits" in the catastrophic care legislation 
because of rising cost estimates. High on the list of benefits to be considered 
is "prescription drugs, whether that should be retained or dropped," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen was immediately criticized by Sen. John Heinz (R-Pa.), one of the key 
Republican members of the committee, who said that it would be a "grave error" 
to cut the drug benefit. By first promising a surtax cut and now saying that 
the surplus funds have disappeared, Bentsen "has left himself and the rest of 
us a bit out on a limb," Heinz said. 
</P>
<P>
The drug benefit "has the best value and does the most benefit for the greatest 
number of people," among all the provisions of the catastrophic care bill, 
Heinz said. At least 5 million people a year would be helped with their drug 
bills, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen's pessimism on costs will intensify the already volatile debate over 
catastrophic care, adopted by Congress last year as the biggest expansion of 
Medicare benefits since the program was created in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Starting Jan. 1, the law provided unlimited hospital care after the beneficiary 
pays the first $560. Future benefits are planned to include a cap on 
out-of-pocket spending for doctor bills, and phased-in coverage of prescription 
drugs for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Because of budget constraints, Congress decided to require all 33 million 
Medicare beneficiaries to pay $4 a month for the new services. 
</P>
<P>
But the bulk of the program's financing is to come from a surtax that will be 
levied on only the 40% of beneficiaries who pay federal income taxes. This 
surtax, which is called a supplemental premium, is calculated at the rate of 
$22.50 for every $150 owed in federal taxes. Thus, a person with a federal tax 
bill of $1,500 would pay another $225 for the catastrophic care program. The 
premium rises with income, reaching a maximum of $800 a year for an individual 
and $1,600 for a married couple. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Higher Taxes Opposed 
</P>
<P>
The surtax, which will be paid for the first time with 1989 tax returns filed 
next year, generated considerable controversy, particularly among retired 
government employees, military personnel and union workers already enjoying 
good medical coverage. These retirees argue that they will be paying higher 
taxes for coverage that they already have. 
</P>
<P>
Bentsen and other supporters of the law have barely fought off efforts in the 
Senate to delay its implementation. In an effort to assuage the critics, 
Bentsen had said that he would support a cut in the surtax of as much as 16% 
because of an expected surplus of revenues. 
</P>
<P>
But he met Monday with officials of the Congressional Budget Office who told 
him that the cost of the drug benefit may be far greater than expected. The 
benefit begins with a few rare drugs next year. In 1991, the program will pay 
half the cost of prescription drugs and insulin after the patient pays the 
first $600. 
</P>
<P>
Although the benefit has yet to begin, estimates have been soaring because drug 
prices are rising rapidly, as are estimates of the amount of drugs that the 
elderly will consume when the government helps pay the bill. 
</P>
<P>
The Finance Committee on Tuesday heard a long list of witnesses appeal for 
delay or changes in the catastrophic program. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a great desire for change in this area," said Sen. Larry Pressler 
(R-S.D.). The special surtax is a "burden borne by too few people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.) called for a delay of one or two years in the full 
catastrophic care coverage. Congress should take "a broad look at our future 
direction in health care for retirees -- a topic of which catastrophic coverage 
is only a part." 
</P>
<P>
Some critics of the catastrophic care program say that it should be offered on 
a voluntary basis, giving Medicare beneficiaries the chance to reject this 
additional coverage.

The third growth of leaves on the vandalized Treaty Oak in Austin, Tex., is 
turning "brown and crunchy," but a city forester said he remains hopeful the 
landmark tree will refoliate -- at least partially -- next spring. But forester 
John Giedraitis said even if the 500-year-old tree survives, it will not be the 
same sprawling live oak that admirers remember before it was intentionally 
poisoned with the powerful herbicide Velpar. City workers have removed all the 
poisoned soil and are continuing to mist the tree with cooling spring water and 
protect it with giant sun shades to lessen stress as temperatures climb into 
the high 90s each day. Paul Stedman Cullen, 45, of Elroy has been charged with 
felony criminal mischief in the poisoning of the tree.

BILL TO SET .08% LEGAL ALCOHOL LEVEL GAINS 
</P>

<P>
Senate-approved legislation to reduce the blood-alcohol level at which a 
motorist is considered drunk narrowly cleared a substantial barrier in the 
Assembly on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco), chairman of the Public Safety 
Committee, who opposed such legislation in the past, cast the critical vote to 
send the proposal to the full Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
The author, Sen. Bill Leonard (R-Big Bear), predicted that the measure will win 
legislative approval and be sent to Gov. George Deukmejian, whose 
Administration supports it. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, long dominated by liberals and historically known to critics as 
the Assembly graveyard for law-and-order legislation, approved the bill on a 
5-0 vote, the exact favorable margin required on the eight-member panel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Same Standard 
</P>
<P>
Since 1969 in California, a driver whose blood-alcohol level measures 0.10% has 
been presumed to be legally drunk. Leonard's bill would lower the level to 
0.08%, the same standard imposed by at least three other states. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard, who carried a similar bill several years ago that failed in the same 
committee, asserted Tuesday that his measure would send a strong signal that 
"if you are going to drink, make other plans about driving." 
</P>
<P>
He said that while a driver now is presumed to be legally drunk at 0.10%, a 
motorist's judgment and driving skills are impaired at 0.08%, a contention 
disputed by some opponents of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
"I want everyone to know that they are impaired, even at very low blood alcohol 
levels," Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
But Burton and Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush (R-Saratoga), who also voted 
for the bill, asked how a drinking person could determine when he or she had 
reached 0.08% or even 0.10%. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard conceded that there is no universal standard that fits everyone but 
that a 0.08% level would make "people more aware before they begin to drink and 
(motivate) them in advance to have someone else drive." 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of opponents of the bill, the California Public Defenders Assn. 
and California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, argued that existing law is 
adequate. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, they noted that it is possible for a prosecutor to get a 
drunk driving conviction at 0.08% or less and that studies of the issue 
produced conflicting results over how impaired the judgment was of various 
drivers who tested at 0.08%. 
</P>
<P>
After the committee action, Leonard cited Burton for heading a "real turnaround 
on that committee for my bill." 
</P>
<P>
As a relatively new assemblyman in 1966, Burton voted against the "implied 
consent" law, under which a driver's license can be suspended or revoked for 
failure to submit to a blood alcohol test. Three years later, he voted against 
the bill that set the 0.10% level for intoxication. 
</P>
<P>
In 1974, Burton was elected to Congress but did not seek reelection in 1982 
because of a problem with alcohol and drugs. He since has fought his way back 
to sobriety and was returned to the Assembly last year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that driving under the influence is a very serious situation," Burton 
said in response to a reporter's question about his reversal on voting for a 
drunk driving bill that closely resembled one he voted against in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
He indicated that attitudes about drunk driving, including his own views, have 
changed drastically over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when guys almost bragged about the fact that they had five or 
six (drunk driving arrests)," he said. "People used to joke about it." 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether his own experience with substance abuse played a part in his vote 
on the Leonard bill, Burton replied without elaboration, "Maybe."

SUIT FILED TO APPEAL LIMITS ON ABORTIONS 
</P>

Opening a new round in the legal battle over abortion, a coalition of civil 
rights and women's groups Tuesday asked a state Court of Appeal to strike down 
the Legislature's latest restrictions on state-funded abortions for low-income 
women. 
</P>
<P>
The action represents the first test of abortion rights in California since the 
U.S. Supreme Court last week gave states more power to limit abortion without 
violating federal constitutional standards. 
</P>
<P>
The legislative restrictions, included in the 1989-90 budget signed last week 
by Gov. George Deukmejian, would bar state funding for about 90% of the 80,000 
abortions now being performed annually under the Medi-Cal program at a cost of 
about $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Under the limitations, state-funded abortions would be permitted only if the 
mother's life is in danger, the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest, the 
unborn child was severely deformed or when unmarried minors have notified their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Right to Privacy Issue 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups contended in 
a suit filed with the appeals court that the restrictions violate the right to 
privacy and other provisions of the California Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Similar abortion-funding limits have been overturned by state courts for the 
last 11 years and have never taken effect. But anti-abortion forces have 
expressed hope that their cause has been given new momentum by the U.S. Supreme 
Court ruling, which, while not changing California law, did ease the way for 
states to curb abortion. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, an attorney for the state Department of Health Services, one of the 
defendants in the suit, said the state plans to cite the federal high court 
ruling in its defense of the Legislature's restrictions on funding. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a 12-year-old lawsuit and the issues aren't that different," said 
William D. Lockett, assistant chief counsel for the department. "The only thing 
that is different is the U.S. Supreme Court ruling. And we'll try to use that 
to our advantage." 
</P>
<P>
A liberal-dominated state Supreme Court held in 1981 that limits on Medi-Cal 
abortions violated the state constitutional right to privacy. But in 1987, the 
court underwent a dramatic philosophical realignment that put conservatives in 
the majority, leading to speculation that it might take a new look at the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, the justices have twice sidestepped the question, refusing 
to review appeal court rulings invalidating abortion-funding restrictions. Nor 
has the new high court had an opportunity in any case to set forth its views on 
the scope of the state right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, lawyers for the groups challenging the new restrictions 
on abortion rejected the suggestion that last week's U.S. Supreme Court ruling 
could provide new incentive for the state high court to tackle the issue. Such 
an opportunity could come within months in the form of an appeal from whatever 
decision is issued by the appellate court in the abortion-funding case. 
</P>
<P>
"All we can say is we hope and expect this court to be principled and obey its 
own precedents," said Margaret C. Crosby, staff counsel for the ACLU of 
Northern California. "I have no reason to fear the state Supreme Court." 
</P>
<P>
The suit asked the appeals court by Friday to issue a temporary stay of the new 
budget restrictions and bar state officials from notifying Medi-Cal recipients 
of those limitations. Then, after briefs are filed, the court should 
permanently block enforcement of the restrictions as it has in the past, the 
suit contended. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions, the suit said, "would immediately result in a profound, 
disastrous effect on the lives of the poor." Only about 10% of the low-income 
women seeking state-funded abortion would be able to meet the new requirements, 
it said. 
</P>
<P>
The suit argued that the restrictions collide directly with the state Supreme 
Court's 1981 ruling, violating the state provision to rights to privacy and 
equal protection of the law. 
</P>
<P>
Further, it said, the limitations conflict with another state constitutional 
provision requiring that bills passed by the Legislature be limited to a 
"single subject." The legislators improperly used the Budget Act, which 
involves appropriations, to make substantive changes in separate laws 
authorizing abortions in the Medi-Cal program, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, the state Court of Appeal has agreed with such a 
contention, striking down abortion-funding limits as violating both the state 
right to privacy and the legislative single-subject rule.

AIR TRAFFIC COMPUTER FAILS 104 TIMES IN A DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new, multimillion-dollar computer system failed repeatedly for brief periods 
throughout the day Sunday at the El Toro-based regional air traffic control 
center, endangering air safety, controllers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the computer system failed 104 times for periods of up to five minutes, 
resulting in certain computerized flight information disappearing from video 
screens used by controllers at the Coast Terminal Radar Approach Control, known 
as Coast TRACON. 
</P>
<P>
There were no near collisions reported during the outages, officials said, but 
federal air traffic controllers had no way of knowing an aircraft's altitude or 
identity except through voice communication during the failures. 
</P>
<P>
"It was more than a little problem. You might say it was pretty chaotic," said 
Jim Miller, deputy manager of the El Toro center. 
</P>
<P>
However, Merle Clure, the Federal Aviation Administration's Los Angeles-based 
assistant regional manager for air traffic, minimized the air safety danger, 
saying that the longest computer outage lasted 5 minutes, and even though 
computerized flight data was lost during the outages, radar scopes continued to 
show each aircraft's position. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a hardware problem, and we think we have it corrected," Clure said. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were no "near-misses," aircraft departing from Los Angeles 
International Airport through airspace controlled by the Orange County facility 
did encounter short delays because controllers were swamped with duties, 
according to Randy Moore, representative of the National Air Traffic 
Controllers Assn. at Coast TRACON. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank goodness there were no mid-airs (collisions). . . . There was no 
backup," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
The computer failures wiped altitude, speed, aircraft identification and radio 
frequency data off of controllers' screens, according to Moore, the 
controllers' association representative. However, the screens did show aircraft 
as blips or so-called targets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Miller said an emergency technical crew was flown in from New Jersey and worked 
all night Monday to correct the problem. 
</P>
<P>
There were at least four computer failures Monday, and three as of 3 p.m. 
Tuesday, Moore said. The FAA's Clure said he was unaware of any further 
computer failures after Monday night's repairs and could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Similar Failures 
</P>
<P>
Moore said other radar facilities in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area 
have experienced similar computer failures in the past. But Clure said those 
problems were unrelated to the hardware difficulty at Coast TRACON. 
</P>
<P>
Moore complained Tuesday that there is no backup system to the costly FAA 
computers, which 2 1/2 months ago replaced an aging system that did employ 
backups. 
</P>
<P>
Clure, however, said some of the lost flight data would have been available at 
Coast TRACON if some parts for an inoperative decoder were not on back order. 
"We've placed those parts on high priority, but they're not here yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The decoder deciphers information from aircraft transponders, devices in 
airplanes that give information about the plane's altitude. 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that the controllers' group previously filed complaints with the FAA 
about the El Toro system and has filed similar complaints at TRACON facilities 
elsewhere that have received the same system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FAA Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, the National Transportation Safety Board strongly criticized 
the FAA for working conditions at Coast TRACON, saying that it has a 
higher-than-average error rate that has led to several near collisions of 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA has blamed the problem partly on inadequate staffing. Special pay 
incentives were recently approved by Congress and the Administration to try to 
boost recruitment of additional controllers for places such as Orange County, 
where hiring has been slow. Officials have blamed high housing costs for making 
recruitment difficult.

SENATE VOTES TO HELP CHINA STUDENTS STAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Senate, ignoring objections raised by President Bush, voted unanimously 
Tuesday to modify the Administration's new program allowing more than 40,000 
Chinese students in the United States to delay their return to China. 
</P>
<P>
By a 97-0 vote, the Senate agreed that the students would be permitted to 
remain in the United States until June 5, 1990, without being required to make 
any statement that might brand them as dissidents. After that, their departure 
could be delayed until as late as June 5, 1992, unless both the President and 
the attorney general certify that the political climate in China no longer 
poses any danger to them. 
</P>
<P>
In all cases, students under orders to leave the United States would be given 
60 days to appeal their cases before their extended stay is officially 
terminated. In addition, the Senate measure eliminates a provision in current 
law requiring them to return to China for at least two years before seeking 
immigrant status. 
</P>
<P>
The provision was designed to answer the many complaints that Chinese students 
have expressed about the delayed departure program that Bush created after the 
June 3-4 massacre in Beijing's Tian An Men Square. 
</P>
<P>
While many Chinese students want to delay their return home in the wake of the 
killing of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people during the military assault, 
and many are worried by the ensuing political crackdown, most believe that by 
filing for delayed departure under the President's program, they might be 
branded traitors by the Beijing government. Under Bush's plan, they must 
declare their unwillingness to go home. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many Chinese students fear that by entering the program outlined by 
Bush, they are agreeing to return home after one year -- even if conditions 
there have not improved. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, very few Chinese students have applied to the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service to take advantage of the Administration program. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate measure represents a bipartisan compromise. Some senators such as 
Slade Gorton (R-Wash.) had been seeking sweeping legislation that would allow 
all Chinese students to apply immediately for permanent residency status. But 
such proposals were strongly opposed by others, including Alan K. Simpson 
(R-Wyo.), assistant minority leader and the Senate's leader on immigration 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) acknowledged that the Senate measure 
does not have the support of the President, but he insisted that Administration 
officials had raised only "some slight reservations" about these changes in 
Bush's program. 
</P>
<P>
Both Dole and Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), who 
co-sponsored the Senate amendment, said that the changes they propose are in 
keeping with the original objectives of the President's program. 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell indicated that many Chinese students had lobbied him personally for 
these changes. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe we should respond generously to this request by the Chinese students 
who are living among us and bravely standing up for freedom and democracy in 
their homeland," Mitchell said.

Prime Minister Sousuke Uno left today for the economic summit in Paris, where 
he will pledge more than $65 billion in debt relief and environmental aid for 
developing nations, a government official said. 
</P>
<P>
A Finance Ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said much of 
the assistance would be in the form of loans, some with easy terms. 
</P>
<P>
The loans would be designed to help debt-ridden countries restructure old loans 
as a way to reduce debt payments. The approach reflects support for U.S. 
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's Third World debt reduction plan. 
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry official said $500 million would be set aside for projects 
to protect the environment. 
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit of major industrialized democracies begins Friday. Before 
the start, Uno is to meet with officials from the other participating nations 
-- Britain, Canada, France, Italy, West Germany and the United States, the 
Foreign Ministry announced.

ISRAELI PARTIES LOOK FOR NEW ALLIANCES 
</P>

<P>
Rival Israeli politicians began to probe, bargain and cajole among themselves 
Tuesday in search of alliances to form the basis of a new government or grounds 
to revive the old one, which is in danger of collapsing after eight months. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leader Shimon Peres began meeting with the heads of minor religious 
parties to discuss conditions for creating a center-left coalition he would 
head -- if his party decides to leave the government. Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Shamir, who leads the rightist Likud Party, followed suit, saying all the while 
it would be a mistake for Labor to pull out. 
</P>
<P>
The maneuvering was set off when Shamir's rightist Likud Party drew attention 
to an open secret: that Likud and Labor, uneasy partners in government, differ 
radically on their views for ending the Israeli-Arab conflict. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a meeting of Likud's central committee passed a resolution that 
would preclude steps in a government peace plan that, among other things, might 
lead to giving up the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The center-left Labor 
wants such an option left open. 
</P>
<P>
Labor's advisory party bureau responded Monday by proposing to leave the 
coalition. But it set no date for a meeting of the party's central committee, 
which would make the final decision. Some Labor members, as well as many 
partisans of Likud, want to keep the government in one piece. The question 
comes down to whether differences over the peace plan can be reconciled, or at 
least bottled up. 
</P>
<P>
Likud leaders complained Tuesday that the country is being left adrift while 
Labor makes up its mind. "For three or four weeks, we won't know what is going 
on," said Avi Pazner, Shamir's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, a member of Likud, insisted that Labor lacks 
valid reasons to pull out. Arens, as well as Shamir, is said to prefer 
maintaining the partnership with Labor rather than deal with demands of Likud's 
right wing, not to mention ultra-nationalist parties outside Likud. 
</P>
<P>
Arens said that nothing had changed in the peace initiative, which is centered 
on Arab elections in the West Bank and Gaza. Likud's central committee won a 
pledge from Shamir that no land would be given up to Arabs and that Arab 
residents of annexed East Jerusalem would be banned from participating in the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
The conditions were put forward by members of Likud's right wing who have long 
opposed the plan for Arab elections. One of them, Housing Minister David Levy, 
visited Shamir on Tuesday to insist that Likud maintain its position. 
</P>
<P>
Labor officials continued to argue that the Likud conditions effectively killed 
the proposal. They also viewed with alarm the apparent ascendancy of Ariel 
Sharon, the hawkish Likud Cabinet minister who backed the conditions, to a 
position of policy-making influence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deep Mistrust 
</P>
<P>
Leftists in the Labor Party expressed a deep mistrust of Likud assurances that 
nothing has changed. "Shamir will say anything to keep Labor in. The problem is 
that Sharon dominates Likud. We will not be part of a Sharon government," said 
Labor member of Parliament Uzi Baram. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the delay in Labor's final decision left some room. "The time 
lapse can give Shamir and his allies breathing space to erase the results of 
Likud's meeting," predicted political analyst Akiva Eldar in the Haaretz 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Newspapers were generally skeptical that the government would actually fall. 
One headline blared: "It's Not Over Yet." 
</P>
<P>
The current wave of politicking brought to mind the rounds of coalition talks 
that followed elections last November, when neither Labor nor Likud was able to 
build a working majority in the 120-member Parliament. After much wrangling, 
the two major parties joined in a fractured partnership, leaving most marginal 
parties on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
The same obstacles that confronted each party then still hold true: Religious 
parties control the balance of power, and to make a deal, either Shamir or 
Peres would have to give ground on divisive issues of religious authority.

A WEEK AFTER ISRAELI BUS ATTACK, U.S. BRANDS INCIDENT AS TERRORISM

Almost a week after a fatal bus crash, the United States on Tuesday branded as 
terrorism the incident in which 14 Israelis were killed when a Palestinian 
grabbed the steering wheel and sent the vehicle into a ravine. 
</P>
<P>
The accident has inflamed anti-Arab passions in Israel and is believed to have 
strengthened support for political forces opposing Israeli-Palestinian peace 
efforts in which the Bush Administration is deeply involved. 
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of available evidence now, it was clearly a terrorist attack," 
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
He addressed a news briefing hours after Israel accused the United States of 
giving Palestinians a "license to kill" by not condemning more strongly the bus 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
"If the United States does not call it terrorism, in fact it gives a license to 
kill to every Palestinian individual or organization," Foreign Ministry 
spokesman Alon Liel said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Boucher replied: "There is no license being offered." 
</P>
<P>
Boucher conceded that the United States did not know whether anyone else -- 
other than the Palestinian who seized the steering wheel -- was behind the 
attack. But he said it was apparent that the incident was pre-planned, 
politically motivated and an act against innocent civilians. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the State Department described the incident as senseless and 
tragic but declined to define it as terrorism, saying it did not have the 
information to warrant that characterization. The word terrorism is a loaded 
term in the Middle East. Israeli officials said Washington's refusal to use the 
word was an effort to justify continued U.S. talks with the Palestine 
Liberation Organization.

NORTH APPEALS CONVICTION IN CONTRA AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former White House aide Oliver L. North formally notified the federal court 
Tuesday that he is appealing his conviction and suspended sentence in the 
Iran-Contra case but did not immediately spell out the legal grounds for the 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, North said in legal papers that he wants to begin promptly 
the 1,200-hour "community service" part of his sentence, which will involve 
working with inner-city District of Columbia youths who are regularly exposed 
to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
In view of the leniency of the sentence imposed last week by U.S. District 
Judge Gerhard A. Gesell, North's appeal apparently is aimed at clearing his 
name, removing a ban on his holding federal office and avoiding the $150,000 
fine Gesell imposed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Payment Required Now 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Court of Appeals generally takes one to two years to act. North may 
delay payment of the fine until the appellate process is exhausted, Gesell said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, in declaring that North had acted "to carry out the initiatives 
of a few cynical superiors," Gesell handed North a suspended three-year 
sentence and placed him on probation for two of those three years. 
</P>
<P>
North's attorneys said in their court filing that he wants to begin his 
community service before his appeal is acted upon because "we understand that 
the next 6 to 12 months is a critical start-up period during which the program 
could best use the assistance" of the retired Marine lieutenant colonel. 
</P>
<P>
Gesell, in telling North last week that prison time "would only harden your 
misconceptions" about his past illegal conduct, said that he wants the 
community "to get the benefit of your organizational and administrative skills, 
which are very high." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Destruction of Documents 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), a leading supporter of North, has told 
reporters that "the harshest penalty" for North is a prohibition against 
holding federal office because of his conviction in May on charges that he 
altered and destroyed top-secret government documents -- one of three felony 
counts on which a jury found him guilty. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan and other congressmen have urged a presidential pardon for North, partly 
to remove this prohibition. A successful appeal would accomplish the same 
result. North has been urged by some supporters to run for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
North's lawyers are expected to claim that Gesell infringed on North's right to 
defend himself by limiting the evidence he could introduce at trial. Gesell 
established guidelines for classified material that could be used at trial 
under the 1980 Classified Information Procedures Act, a law that North's 
attorneys have argued is unconstitutional.

DNC LEFTIES TOO MUCH FOR GOP; WIN STREAK OVER

After 25 years of eating Republican dust -- softball dust -- the Democrats were 
starving for a big win at the annual slugfest simply called "The Game." They 
wanted it so badly Tuesday night that they were eager to play in 96-degree 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
The Democratic National Committee versus the Republican National Committee 
midsummer softball match on the Ellipse wasn't a game; it was a three-hour 
campaign led by DNC Chairman Ron Brown and RNC Chairman Lee Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
Brown predicted a victory because of "new leadership" at the DNC. "We don't 
want to hurt them too badly. Atwater's had enough of a hard time lately," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Atwater, wearing a bright red Hawaiian shirt and "Late Night With David 
Letterman" baseball cap, explained that his players were the same ones who won 
last year's presidential campaign. Winners. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Sorts of Fans 
</P>
<P>
The Republicans showed up with more than 200 fans sporting the latest in 
upscale chic, with crates of Gatorade, soda and beer, and T-shirts featuring an 
elephant playing a guitar. 
</P>
<P>
The Democrats had barely 25 fans in the stands, a couple of coolers filled with 
water and "RUN DNC" red-and-white jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
It was 2-0 GOP at the end of the first inning. By the end of the second, the 
Republican team was leading 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
"This game is a little statement in itself," said Steve Sterling, one of the 
many Republicans wearing, despite the heat, a gray suit, white shirt, blue tie 
and matching reflecting sunglasses. "This game is a blowout already. Like 
always, they'll never make it the distance." 
</P>
<P>
But the Democrats loped, dived and scrambled for five runs in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
"Notice that the Democrats have scored all their runs with smashing line drives 
down the left field line because the Republicans can't cover the left. They 
don't understand it," said James Ruvolo, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tied in the Sixth 
</P>
<P>
By the end of the sixth inning, all the fans had spilled out of the stands and 
were roaring on the sidelines as the two teams battled to an 8-8 tie. 
</P>
<P>
The DNC drove in the winning run in the top of the ninth inning and, 
miraculously -- even to the Democrats -- successfully defended their lead to 
win their first game in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a lot of intensity and a lot of talent," Brown shouted. What about 
luck? "No, no. Leadership. I would attribute it to leadership." 
</P>
<P>
"Softball's one thing; politics is something else," Atwater said. "I guess 
maybe I'm better at hardball than at softball."

2 AF POLICEMEN CHARGED IN THEFT OF JET ENGINES

Two Air Force policemen were charged with stealing three F-16 aircraft engines, 
authorities said Tuesday, and 12 other people were indicted in a sting in which 
FBI agents ran a military surplus store dealing in stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
Agents have identified up to 100 suspects, some military policemen, at Hill Air 
Force Base, other Utah installations and 15 other communities in the West and 
Southwest, said Robert Bryant, agent in charge of the FBI's Utah office. 
</P>
<P>
The indictments remained sealed in federal court, and the names of those 
charged were not released. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many MPs Involved 
</P>
<P>
"The thefts at Hill . . . appear to be part of a larger problem involving other 
states and other military establishments," U.S. Atty. Dee Benson said. 
"Unfortunately, many of the participants are military policemen, and we find 
that especially disturbing." 
</P>
<P>
Benson identified the two men arrested at a Bountiful restaurant Monday night 
as Airman 1st Class Brian Roth of Chesterland, Ohio, and Senior Airman Danny 
Joe Stroud of Newton, Kan. Benson said he expected "many more" arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Operation Punchout, a joint effort of the FBI, the Defense Department and the 
Air Force, began in 1986, when stolen military goods became increasingly 
available in the Salt Lake Valley, Bryant said. It targeted military and 
civilian personnel as well as wholesalers of stolen goods, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FBI Ran Surplus Store 
</P>
<P>
The FBI established a storefront in Roy near the base called Military Surplus 
Brokers, which spent about $80,000 to buy thousands of items worth about 
$600,000 that were stolen from all branches of the military, Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
Benson said the stolen military equipment included sleeping bags, helmets, 
canteens, munitions and firearms, as well as the jet engines, although no 
military systems or strategic weapons were involved. 
</P>
<P>
He said Roth and Stroud had approached undercover officers with an offer to 
sell the jet fighter engines. The two were given a down payment of $10,000 
toward a purchase price of $300,000 for the three engines, which are valued at 
$2 million each. 
</P>
<P>
The two men brought the Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, which had been reported 
missing last Wednesday by maintenance personnel, to the FBI agents by trailer. 
Both were charged with theft of government property and conspiracy.

CHENEY SEES SAVINGS IN NEW CONTRACT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Predicting savings of $30 billion over the next five years, Defense Secretary 
Dick Cheney unveiled a new plan Tuesday to streamline the Pentagon's procedures 
for awarding contracts annually worth $150 billion. 
</P>
<P>
But Cheney warned that "there is no silver bullet" that will quickly eliminate 
fraud and waste from the Defense Department. Instead, he said, a number of 
steps must be taken if the Pentagon is to get well-built weapons delivered on 
time. 
</P>
<P>
Among those steps, which were approved last week by President Bush: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The creation of a new committee composed of top-ranking Pentagon officials 
responsible for coordinating weapons purchases with national security and arms 
control objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The establishment of a Defense Department ethics council charged with 
educating the department's employees on standards of conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 -- New hiring and promotion standards among the Defense Department's 350,000 
civilian employees involved in military contracting. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The establishment of a separate career path with special educational 
requirements for about 30,000 military officers involved in acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The increased use of multiyear commitments to the development and 
production of some weapons systems, which it is hoped would provide industry 
with an incentive to lower costs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Strictly defined performance standards that every Pentagon weapons system 
must satisfy before proceeding to a further phase of development or production. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paper Work Burdens Cited 
</P>
<P>
The defense chief echoed several of his predecessors in laying part of the 
blame for the department's management ills on Congress. Cheney said his former 
colleagues on Capitol Hill must do their part to remove paper work burdens on 
the Defense Department if it is to function more efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
"Our efforts will be for nought unless we can get some help from Capitol Hill," 
Cheney said. He charged that Congress' "micro-management" of defense matters 
appears to have driven up the number of regulations governing Pentagon 
acquisition to 1,600. Since 1970, the number of reports required yearly by 
Congress has increased 1,800%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Standing beside two 5-foot stacks of Pentagon reports delivered to Congress 
last year, Cheney complained that Congress' appetite for Pentagon reports has 
become gluttonous and expensive, costing $35.8 million in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Cheney and Deputy Defense Secretary Donald J. Atwood Jr. said 
that, in imposing new discipline on its own buying decisions, the Pentagon 
should make no new demands on the defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Corporate Ethical Standards 
</P>
<P>
Atwood praised the defense industry for its efforts to develop corporate 
ethical standards and said the Pentagon's role should be to "make sure that 
defense industry governs itself." 
</P>
<P>
Atwood vigorously criticized the "confrontational atmosphere" that has grown in 
relationships among the Pentagon, Congress and the defense industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like it," said Atwood, a former executive at General 
Motors. If private industry had similar relationships with commercial 
suppliers, Atwood said, "they wouldn't be able to function." 
</P>
<P>
Atwood's day-to-day management of the Pentagon is expected to set the tone of 
the department's relations with business. Under his direction, he said, the 
Pentagon will continue to make wide use of competitive bidding in the award of 
major contracts.

FIAT FUNDS OXFORD'S ITALIAN CHAIR WITH $1.1-MILLION GIFT

The Italian automaker Fiat is now in the same league as Nissan of Japan, 
academically speaking. It has pledged $1.1 million to keep Italian studies 
alive at Oxford University, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, Nissan has funded the chair in modern Japanese studies at Britain's 
oldest university, which has been hurt by cuts in government grants. 
</P>
<P>
School officials said Monday that the Fiat money will ensure the next 130 years 
of Italian teaching at the school, which was founded in the 12th Century and 
began teaching Italian in 1856. 
</P>
<P>
The Fiat gift is the first major industrial sponsorship gained by Oxford in its 
five-year campaign to raise $356 million. 
</P>
<P>
Three of Oxford's 120 chairs -- French, German and physics -- are vacant 
because there is no money to fund them, and 18 others urgently need funding to 
avoid falling vacant following impending retirements, Anne Lonsdale, a 
university spokeswoman, said. 
</P>
<P>
She said each chair costs $1.6 million to finance "in perpetuity" through 
investing the cash in endowment funds.

EX-DEPUTY ROSS LOSES BID TO DELAY HEARING ON FIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD L. SOBLE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles County hearing officer Tuesday rejected a plea by Sheriff's 
Department Investigator Rickey Ross for a month's delay to prepare his fight to 
overturn his firing after a Sheriff's Department representative warned that 
postponement would mean the loss of a key witness. 
</P>
<P>
Ross was charged last February with murdering three South-Central Los Angeles 
prostitutes with his service handgun. The accusation was dropped in May when 
prosecutors said the original weapons tests linking Ross to the slayings were 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
But Ross had in the interim been fired by the Sheriff's Department, forcing 
Tuesday's administrative hearing before the Los Angeles County Civil Service 
Commission. During the hearing, Sheriff's Sgt. Susan Weekly warned that the 
request by Ross' attorney, Howard Weitzman, to continue the proceedings 
amounted to an "untimely delaying tactic." 
</P>
<P>
The key witness, Jimmie Joann McGhee, 21, of Denver, was scheduled to testify 
this week at the administrative hearing on the Ross case. Weekly said McGhee, 
who is currently serving a six-month prostitution sentence at the Sybil Brand 
Institute for Women, could be released at the end of this month, or no later 
than early August, a move that could make her unavailable for testimony if the 
hearing was delayed a month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Return Home 
</P>
<P>
Weekly said McGhee planned to return to her Denver home after her release. 
County administrative hearing officers do not have out-of-state subpoena power, 
Weekly noted. 
</P>
<P>
But after Tuesday's hearing, a Times reporter asked a Sheriff's Department 
spokesman, Richard Dinsmoor, to check McGhee's official prison release date. 
Dinsmoor said McGhee cannot be released before Aug. 31, a date that 
contradicted Weekly's hearing statement. 
</P>
<P>
Dinsmoor said McGhee's release date included credit for good behavior, work 
time and the early release program, which takes into account crowded prison 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the contradiction in dates, Weekly said McGhee had "provided me 
with the information." Weekly, who works for the sheriff's civil advocacy unit, 
said she never checked with the Custody Division to determine McGhee's official 
release date. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by hearing officer Arnold L. Faber to restart the Ross hearing on 
Friday angered Weitzman, who signed on as Ross' attorney over the July 4 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"You've been . . . utterly unreasonable," declared Weitzman, who has had a 
number of high-profile clients, including auto maker John Z. DeLorean. 
</P>
<P>
Weitzman told Faber he will seek a stay of the decision from a Superior Court 
judge in an effort to gain more time to study the controversial case. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not prepared to go forward," he told Faber. "I want 30 days to get ready. 
I don't think that's unreasonable." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bear the Cost 
</P>
<P>
Since the three-day hearing into Ross' efforts to regain his job had been 
scheduled to begin Tuesday, Faber ruled that Ross will have to bear the cost -- 
about $650 -- of Tuesday's aborted session. 
</P>
<P>
Ross, 40, of Rialto, an 18-year department veteran, was fired April 27 by 
Sheriff Sherman Block for allegedly abusing alcohol and drugs and soliciting 
sex from a prostitute, McGhee, according to Block's job termination letter to 
Ross. 
</P>
<P>
McGhee was in a car with Ross when he was arrested by police last February, 
according to Block's four-page letter. McGhee told investigators she "was a 
prostitute who exchanged sexual favors for drugs," the letter said. She said 
Ross "provided a small piece of cocaine," which the two were smoking, when 
police approached the car, the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
In a subsequent interview with The Times, McGhee confirmed that both she and 
Ross "smoked a hit." But she said she lied to police when she told them Ross 
had provided the cocaine for fear she would get a stiff prison sentence. 
Actually, McGhee said, she bought the cocaine with $10 Ross gave her.

11 SOUTHLAND PEACE OFFICERS HONORED: THEY ARE THE ONES WHO DELIVERED IN THE 
CLUTCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH J. MANN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Highway Patrolman Jeffrey Jones said he expected trouble when a car, 
with horn blaring and bright lights flashing, pulled up behind him on the San 
Diego Freeway more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"If they didn't have a good excuse, I was ready to give them a ticket," he 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of issuing a citation, Jones delivered a baby. 
</P>
<P>
And the parents, who flagged down the patrol car after they got lost en route 
to the hospital, gave Jones rave reviews Tuesday at a ceremony honoring area 
peace officers who delivered babies while on duty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trusted 'Completely' 
</P>
<P>
"He (Jones) seemed like he knew exactly what he was doing. I trusted him 
completely," said Christine Sizemore, whose daughter, Erica Petit, was born in 
the back seat of a car on the freeway in April, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Jones was one of 11 officers who received awards at a luncheon sponsored by the 
Los Angeles County Medical Assn. In addition to those from the CHP, officers 
from the Beverly Hills Police Department, Los Angeles Police Department and Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department were honored. 
</P>
<P>
For many, it was their first reunion with the babies they brought into the 
world -- and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of neat," said Jones, clutching a picture of Erica in an Easter suit 
that he had just received from the baby's father, Matthew Petit. "That night, 
it was this dripping wet thing, now she is a little baby." 
</P>
<P>
"These guys have all sorts of negative things happen to them in the line of 
duty," Dr. Charles McElwee, president of the association, said of the honorees. 
</P>
<P>
"(This ceremony) is a positive thing for the officers; to encourage them to be 
of service to their community." Los Angeles Police Officers Robert Arellano and 
Tracy Lamaestra were all handshakes and smiles as they greeted Morena Rodriguez 
and her baby, Roberto, whom they delivered in the middle of a downtown 
intersection last October. 
</P>
<P>
Arellano explained that the officers were called to the scene by a frantic 
sergeant when Morena went into labor on the way to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
But when they caught up with the Rodriguez's 1972 Maverick at the corner of 
Figueroa and 5th streets, the officers got another surprise -- the couple spoke 
no English. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to motion to her to pant like a dog," Arellano said. 
</P>
<P>
Arellano, who is 26 and single, conceded that he found the experience, his 
first delivery, a bit confusing. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the baby's head come out. At first, I didn't know what it was," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Arellano and Lamaestra completed the delivery and had the baby safely 
wrapped in his father's suit jacket when the ambulance arrived to whisk him to 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
And Arellano could not have been more proud as he posed for a picture with 
Roberto, who was named after the officer. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect him to be so big," Arellano said. "It feels real good." 
</P>
<P>
CHP Officer Frank Packard walked away with two awards Tuesday. He assisted 
Jones in the birth of Erica and also delivered twins in April, in a CHP office 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"You are always nervous," Packard explained. "I had a little more experience 
the second time around. But I am far from a pro." 
</P>
<P>
State law requires that all peace officers receive emergency obstetrics 
training, but that doesn't always include hands-on experience, said LAPD first 
aid coordinator Martin Kovacs. For example, the department gives a one-hour 
class at the Police Academy in which cadets watch a film and hear a lecture 
about delivering babies. Then they are on their own, Kovacs said. 
</P>
<P>
But veteran Patrolman David Darling, who received an award Tuesday, said 
delivering babies is not as tough as it might seem. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, you just watch and hope for the best," he explained.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 4-DAY ORDEAL AT LAX PIECED TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A problem over payment for an airline ticket was apparently the source of 
confusion that led a 70-year-old Panorama City woman to become disoriented and 
wander around Los Angeles International Airport for four days, Los Angeles 
police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Irene Rodriguez was to use a prepaid ticket issued on a credit card to board a 
flight last Wednesday to Lincoln, Neb., to join her family, said Detective Mel 
Arnold, citing information police have pieced together. But at check-in, 
Rodriguez "was not issued a ticket because of a problem with the credit card," 
Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez thought the problem was temporary and checked into a hotel near the 
airport. She returned the next day but could not get a ticket. Meanwhile, her 
luggage, which contained her medication for heart and diabetes problems, had 
been misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
"She was becoming disoriented and sick because of the lack of medication," 
Arnold said. She also could not afford a hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez's ordeal ended Sunday when Travelers Aid Society volunteers notified 
police. She probably will remain hospitalized until at least Thursday. "The 
family is very concerned about her," said Susan Edelstein, director of the 
Travelers Aid office at the airport.

FATHER OF SLAIN GIRL ENDS VIGIL AT HER GRAVE BY TAKING OWN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY and AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wallace Scott Mann spent an all-day vigil Monday at the grave of his slain 
7-year-old daughter in the Eternal Valley Memorial Park in Newhall, sometimes 
sitting near the grave, sometimes watching it from his car. 
</P>
<P>
A cemetery worker saw him use red paint to fill in the lines of the happy face 
and the heart carved on the stone that marks where Sara Nan Hodges lies. 
</P>
<P>
The worker saw Mann paint the petals of the roses carved on the tombstone next 
to an inscription that reads in part, "Sarie's magic is everlasting as is our 
love. Mom &amp; Dad." 
</P>
<P>
And then, sometime during the night, according to authorities, Mann, 36, of 
Ojai, took a shotgun from his car, pointed the barrel at his head and fired, 
falling dead across the grave. 
</P>
<P>
His body was found Tuesday morning, next to a note expressing his love for his 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The blonde-haired girl was found strangled March 26 in a neighbor's home in 
Newhall after authorities and residents mounted an extensive three-day search 
for her. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of Sara's slaying, Mann had been separated from his wife, Linda 
Hodges, and their daughter for more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities and acquaintances said his daughter's death and the breakup of his 
marriage had left Mann emotionally distraught. 
</P>
<P>
A cemetery worker turning on water sprinklers Tuesday morning saw the body 
slumped across the grave. 
</P>
<P>
Around Mann's body were several wilted roses and other flowers, apparently left 
by previous visitors to the grave. There was also Mann's note. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a little note that said, 'I love you' and other things," said 
coroner's investigator Dean Sebree. "It's a little bit rambling, but there's 
nothing that says, 'I am going to commit suicide,' and it didn't name the girl. 
It says he cared deeply for her, words to that effect." 
</P>
<P>
Mann lived with a sister and brother-in-law in Ojai where, according to Hodges, 
a second note was found that more specifically detailed his grief over his 
separation from his family and the death of Sara. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Note 
</P>
<P>
Hodges said the second note read, "When they took away the visitation rights, 
they took half my life. When he killed her, he took away the other half." 
</P>
<P>
Mann's sister and brother-in-law could not be reached for comment, and 
authorities could not confirm that a second note was found. 
</P>
<P>
Sara was reported missing by her family March 23, after disappearing while 
playing near her home on Alderbrook Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Sheriff's deputies conducted a brief house-to-house search in the area, and the 
Sheriff's Department later organized searches, involving several local 
residents, of the undeveloped areas near the girl's home. 
</P>
<P>
But her body was not found until a woman living five doors from Sara's house 
investigated a bad odor in her residence and found the girl's body hidden in 
the bedroom of a 14-year-old guest, Curtis Cooper, who is currently awaiting 
trial in Juvenile Court on a murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
Sara's death touched the community deeply. Nearly 100 people attended her 
funeral, and members of the community contributed $30,000 to her family. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges later said she and her other daughter, Tisha Gates, 16, will donate the 
money to a program for children with behavioral problems. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Court Order 
</P>
<P>
Hodges said that in recent years, Mann had not been in contact with Sara 
because Hodges had obtained a court order barring his visits. Hodges said she 
left her husband because he was "emotionally unstable." 
</P>
<P>
She said Mann told her his problems were rooted in his childhood, during which 
he said he had been abused, but she declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges said she believed that "it was best for the kids" to be away from him. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he loved Sara very much, but some loves are harmful," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the years after their separation, Hodges said, Mann became a devout 
Christian and contacted her periodically and requested to see his daughter. She 
said that in recent months, Mann had been working for his brother-in-law, but 
it was unclear what his job was. 
</P>
<P>
Though separated for about four years, Hodges said she did not move to make the 
divorce final until recently. 
</P>
<P>
She said the divorce was expected to be granted this month and may already have 
been finalized. That may have contributed to Mann's sense of loss of his 
family, Hodges said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Legal Papers 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said legal papers regarding the couple's divorce were found in 
Mann's car at the cemetery, but they did not know if the divorce was completed. 
</P>
<P>
"He led an unhappy, troubled life. And he loved Sara," Hodges said. "It is hard 
on all of us. Maybe it was just too hard for Wally. Maybe he couldn't go on 
without her, or maybe he wanted to be closer to her. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel sad that there is so much pain and so much anguish. And now there is 
more."

The Lopez Canyon Landfill, dumping site for half of the city's garbage, would 
have to be shut down to meet restrictions imposed by the state Waste Management 
Board, the director of the Los Angeles sanitation bureau said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions include reducing the height of trash mounds, the size of the 
landfill and the number of trucks taking garbage to the Lake View Terrace dump 
daily. The board also is considering a reduction in the amount of trash the 
landfill can accept, from 4,000 tons to 3,100 tons a day. 
</P>
<P>
However, city Sanitation Director Delwin A. Biagi said the city will appeal the 
restrictions at a waste board meeting Friday in Sacramento. He criticized the 
board for overreacting to a public outcry against the dump. 
</P>
<P>
"I begin to wonder what the Waste Management Board's job is," Biagi said. "I 
thought that they were there to keep a focus on solid-waste management and on 
its future. But it seems like they're on some sort of a kick now." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Peck, board spokesman, acknowledged that loud and furious opposition from 
neighbors of the East San Fernando Valley landfill -- coupled with a March gas 
leak that resulted in two workers fainting -- played roles in the board's 
decision to issue the strict restrictions. But Peck said the city-operated dump 
would eventually have come under board scrutiny as part of a systematic 
statewide review of landfill permits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contents of Letter 
</P>
<P>
In a letter released Monday, the Waste Management Board said the landfill has 
violated several provisions of its 1977 permit: trash exceeding the maximum 
height of 1,725 feet, allowing more than 400 trucks a day to dump there, 
dumping on more than 140 of its 392 acres and spilling garbage out onto seven 
acres of adjacent U.S. Forest Service land. 
</P>
<P>
The board has asked the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services, which 
polices the dump, to force the city to cease the violations within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
However, Biagi said the city will argue at Friday's meeting that the 1977 
permit was updated with more generous figures that were included in a 1983 
engineering report sent to the state. 
</P>
<P>
"As far as we're concerned, that's part of our permit," Biagi said. 
</P>
<P>
Peck said the board has researched circumstances of the 1983 document and 
determined that it was requested after a rainstorm sent rivers of garbage into 
nearby Kagel Canyon. He said the city never asked that that become part of the 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
News of the state's action was greeted with surprise and elation by neighbors 
of the landfill, who have been working for several years to close the dump. 
When the city last year announced plans to double the landfill's size and 
extend its life beyond the projected 1992 closure, that battle heated up. 
Opposition reached an even more urgent level after the two workers fainted 
March 8. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God the board is jumping into the fray," said Kagel Canyon resident Rob 
Zapple. "It's all the things we've been saying for so long. They're finally 
giving some credence to it." 
</P>
<P>
Zapple and some of his neighbors maintain that the increasing height of the 
landfill has robbed them of an hour of sunlight daily. They also complain that 
odors regularly waft from the dump, and they worry that it could be fouling 
ground water and streams in the area. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, Charles Coffee, who inspects the dump as director of the county's 
environmental management section, has been reluctant to crack down hard on the 
landfill because, he said, he believes that it is operating within the law. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Coffee said he has asked the county counsel's office to review the 
state's latest list of restrictions to determine whether he is bound to enforce 
them. He said he agrees with the city that the 1983 document should stand. 
</P>
<P>
"They are no worse than any other landfill operator," Coffee said. "The things 
that we've found that were wrong up there were wrong with other landfills. They 
are things that are part and parcel of running a landfill."

SUPERVISORS SUPPORT BID FOR CITIZENSHIP BY FILIPINO VETERANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mariano B. Campanilla was one of a group of Filipino World War II veterans who 
took a 43-year-old grievance to the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday, seeking 
support for federal legislation that would grant them and their comrades U.S. 
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
Campanilla, 73, who survived the infamous Death March on Bataan, never got a 
chance to speak to the supervisors. But he left the meeting pleased. 
</P>
<P>
Rushing through their agenda, the board endorsed Campanilla's cause 
unanimously. The supervisors' move adds Los Angeles County to the ranks of 
other governmental bodies that have lent support for a federal bill that would 
grant citizenship to Filipino veterans. 
</P>
<P>
"This was promised by President (Franklin D.) Roosevelt," said Tirso Baldemor, 
president of the 2,000-member Alliance of Filipino American Veterans 
Organizations. Baldemor served in the U.S. Army and then joined American-led 
guerrilla units in the jungle-covered mountains after Japanese troops occupied 
the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
Campanilla and Baldemor were among thousands of Filipinos promised citizenship 
by Roosevelt if they fought for the United States during World War II. They 
were supposed to be able to apply for citizenship in their own country. 
</P>
<P>
But for 10 critical months, from October, 1945, to August, 1946, immigration 
authorities withdrew from the Philippines at the urging of local authorities 
who were forming an independent government. 
</P>
<P>
The law providing for citizenship expired at the end of 1946, and for thousands 
of veterans who wanted to apply in that period, the opportunity to become 
Americans was gone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very clear injustice," said Campanilla, an attorney who has been living 
in Los Angeles since 1986 under a temporary permit. He said he is seeking 
citizenship so he can stay permanently and bring his family from the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Supreme Court Ruling 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, some Filipino veterans obtained citizenship through the 
courts. But the U.S. Supreme Court last year ruled that only Congress could 
grant citizenship to the veterans. 
</P>
<P>
A group of the Filipino veterans then went to Los Angeles County's little-known 
Veterans Advisory Commission seeking its support of legislation sponsored by 
Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton) and Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii) that 
would grant citizenship. The commission in turn recommended that supervisors 
support the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"By their combat service and personal sacrifice, these men have demonstrated 
greater dedication and effort in support of American values than many other 
people who have been granted citizenship," the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
According to the county Veterans Advisory Commission, the legislation will 
"bring relief to the remaining 60,000 to 80,000 Filipino veterans from the 
initial 175,000 to 200,000 troops who courageously risked their lives during 
World War II. Most of them are in their mid-60s to mid-90s, and little time 
remains to fulfill the nation's promise to these brave men." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the veterans have applied for citizenship under the amnesty program, 
but they are concerned that if they pursue that course, they will have to wait 
another five years before they can become citizens.

FAMILIES OF VICTIMS SHOT BY POLICE CALL FOR INQUIRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICTOR MERINA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Families of police shooting victims, displaying poster-size photographs of 
their slain relatives, angrily called Tuesday for an independent prosecutor to 
investigate the use of "excessive force" by law enforcement agencies in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The small gathering of protesters, who also pressed for a citizens committee to 
review alleged police abuse, accused Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner and his office of 
failing to aggressively prosecute law officers who wrongfully kill or injure 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
To dramatize their views, about a dozen protesters joined other members of the 
newly formed Coalition for Police Accountability at a sidewalk news conference 
outside the downtown Criminal Courts Building, where Reiner's offices are 
located. 
</P>
<P>
Among those present was the brother of Lawrence Watts, a 31-year-old carpenter 
from Lancaster, who was shot and killed May 18 by sheriff's deputies in the 
parking lot of an Antelope Valley medical center. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fatal Incident 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department claimed Watts had eluded deputies after a traffic 
stop, crashed his car against a wall and then tried to attack them with a 
"sharply pointed" hand rake. 
</P>
<P>
Although the deputies were cleared in the shooting, Paul Watts said Tuesday 
that his brother's death was unjustified and needed further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"They could have disarmed him easily. I think shooting and killing somebody for 
a minor offense like that is uncalled for," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, relatives of Marcus Donel, who was killed by a sheriff's deputy May 
30, also showed up to denounce authorities for allegedly protecting officers. 
</P>
<P>
Donel, a black, was shot in a driveway behind his Hawthorne home after he was 
mistaken for a Latino man wanted in a nearby robbery. The Sheriff's Department 
claimed Donel had shouted obscenities, failed to comply with deputies' orders 
and appeared to be "reaching for a gun." 
</P>
<P>
But Donel's sister, Tanya, disagreed and said the deputy who shot her brother 
and was cleared by the department should be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
"What makes him so different that he can go out and shoot somebody and say, 
'Well, because I have a gun and badge, it's OK whether it was the suspect or 
not.' It's just not right," she said. 
</P>
<P>
While the Donel and Watts cases are still under investigation, coalition 
members claimed that Reiner has failed to file charges in at least 15 other 
cases since 1985 in which black or Latino men were killed by deputies or police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
"We need prosecution outside the hands of his office. Nobody has the faith in 
him to accomplish the task. We're just whistling in the wind, if we think he'll 
prosecute," said Geri Silva of the Equal Rights Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Reiner was unavailable for comment Tuesday. But Assistant Dist. Atty. Curt 
Livesay defended the prosecutor's office as independent of police agencies and 
said it treats police cases the same as other cases. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can prove it, we file it," he said. "Those are the standards we apply." 
</P>
<P>
Livesay added, "We've attempted our best here to address the problem of police 
shootings by investigating them and making some very tough decisions over the 
years. We stand on those decisions." 
</P>
<P>
Livesay oversees the district attorney's special investigations division, which 
reviews all police shootings in the county to determine whether criminal 
charges should be filed. And he said his section has 10 lawyers and half a 
dozen investigators to specifically review police cases. 
</P>
<P>
But the coalition -- which also includes representatives from the American 
Civil Liberties Union, the Latino Community Justice Center and the Police 
Misconduct Lawyer Referral Service -- argues that the district attorney's 
office has investigated more than 1,000 "use of force" cases since 1980 and 
moved to prosecute officers less than 2% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
"We find an overwhelming reluctance on the part of the district attorney's 
office to prosecute when there is clear evidence of misconduct," said police 
activist Don Jackson, a former Hawthorne policeman who contended the district 
attorney's office and police department have an "in-the-bed relationship" that 
compromises any investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the 2% figure, Livesay said he was unsure exactly how many 
excessive force cases have actually been prosecuted by his office. 
</P>
<P>
But he said he had no objection to the calls for a special prosecutor, which 
would require approval by the Legislature. "It makes no difference to me," he 
said of such a post. "I might apply for that job."

ALICE KAHN: A DOCTOR, HER KINGDOM FOR A DOCTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alice Kahn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My doctor is retiring to take care of sick people. She is leaving her practice 
to work in a hospice with people who have cancer, which is her specialty. Good 
news for the ill; trouble for me. 
</P>
<P>
I can't find another doctor. Even though I am what's known in the trade as a 
"reliable" and "undemanding" patient (meaning I pay my bills and I hardly ever 
get sick), no one wants me. Why? The health insurance plan I have -- the one I 
and my employer pay through the nose for -- doesn't pay enough for some doctors 
and, according to others, recently hasn't even paid at all. So now even doctors 
who are signed on with the plan are refusing to see me. 
</P>
<P>
Trust me; I don't want to see a doctor. Like most adults, I avoid the 
experience of going to the doctor's office like the plague. 
</P>
<P>
Even if I had the plague, I'd still have to go through the "front-office gal." 
After putting you on hold several times, she says, "The doctor can see you in 
eight weeks." Enough time for your impetigo to overtake your face, your ingrown 
toenail to pin you to the floor and your itch "down there" to result in 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
You show up at your appointed time. There you are -- a busy, important person 
forced to read a 1977 Newsweek cover to cover. For 45 minutes, you are confined 
to a small waiting room with 10 hacking, wheezing, sneezing people. Without 
Kleenex. 
</P>
<P>
For another half-hour, you sit shivering in a paper gown in an unheated exam 
room. There's nothing to amuse you but a 1984 Modern Maturity and the 
acoustical ceiling tile. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the MD approaches. He or she pokes you, anoints you and prescribes 
you. Five minutes later, he or she is history (or herstory). 
</P>
<P>
It's just not my idea of a fun way to lose my dignity. But my health plan is 
set up around having a "primary-care provider" as the first stop on the medical 
humiliation train. Only now I can't find one. That means that if I want to go 
on to Door No. 2 -- say, be kept waiting for hours by an orthopedist or 
gynecologist -- I can't. 
</P>
<P>
For two months, I have been caught in health-plan purgatory trying to get a 
screw removed from my foot. The screw was left there after surgery last year 
and should have been removed on June 15. I did everything I was supposed to do. 
Went to work. Paid my bills. Called on May 1 for my screw-removal appointment. 
</P>
<P>
After phone calls to my surgeon's secretary, my primary-care doctor's 
secretary, my health plan's secretary and the Suicide Hotline, I discovered 
that the health plan had denied my request for de-screwing. 
</P>
<P>
This was because my surgeon was not part of the plan (I had already agreed to 
pay him 400 bucks out of pocket to yank the screw). All I needed was for the 
health plan to pay for a clean well-lighted room because, after all, you can't 
just get de-screwed anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
But that distinction got lost somewhere between my surgeon's secretary and my 
primary-care doctor's secretary. So now the whole request process must begin 
again. Only it can't begin again because I don't have a primary-care doctor 
because my doctor is leaving to take care of the sick. 
</P>
<P>
So there you have it. I am an intelligent woman. I was a registered nurse for 
14 years. I have friends in the medical mafia. I have access to major 
metropolitan newspapers. The loose screw is in my foot, and I don't know how to 
get the screw ball rolling. 
</P>
<P>
My only question is: If this is what happens to me, what happens to sick, needy 
people who weren't nurses, who don't have friends who are doctors, who don't 
have health insurance, and who don't have readers to cry to?

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Due on the market in September is a five-in-one laser disc player featuring 
multiplay capabilities for up to three 3-inch or 5-inch compact discs or three 
5-inch CD videos at one time. 
</P>
<P>
Like other similar units, the MV-D100, recently introduced by Sharp Electronics 
Corp., plays 8- and 12-inch laser discs, as well as the 3- and 5-inch CDs and 
5-inch CD videos. 
</P>
<P>
Touted by Sharp as "the ultimate digital disc player," the unit offers 20-step 
random access programming and many automatic functions to facilitate editing 
from CD to cassette. When taping from a CD, for instance, the MV-D100 arranges 
songs according to length so you get maximum use of the tape. 
</P>
<P>
For playback, the unit has an automatic system that skips ahead or back to 
locate the start of the next or previous selection. It has repeat and scan 
functions, which allow a preview of the first 15 seconds of an LD or CD track. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested retail price for the MV-D100, about the size of a VCR, is $1,499.95. 
It will be available nationally in electronics and department stores carrying 
Sharp products. 
</P>
<P>
Visual Art Guide 
</P>
<P>
For Southern California tourists and residents unfamiliar with the area's art 
museums and galleries, there's a new guide to visual art locations from Santa 
Barbara to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
ArtScene, which publishes a monthly guide to art exhibitions and openings, has 
put together a new map and guide to 300 art galleries and museums in Los 
Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
The handy work includes gallery and museum phone numbers and addresses, as well 
as area map guides and tours by region. It tells you how to get there, where to 
park and where you can take walking tours of galleries and museums. 
</P>
<P>
Edited by ArtScene publishers Bill Lasarow (co-founder of the Los Angeles Mural 
Conservancy) and Beate Bermann-Enn, the guide also offers highlights of 
"must-see" viewing dates each month through December at specific museums. 
</P>
<P>
The Map and Tour Guide is available at most museum and gallery locations and in 
many hotels. Or you can order it by mail for $1.50 prepaid from ArtScene, P.O. 
Box 861176, Los Angeles, Calif. 90086; (213) 482-4724.

Melitta Goes Natural 
</P>
<P>
Melitta, the world's largest coffee filter manufacturer, has introduced a new 
line of filters -- "Natural Brown" models made of unbleached paper rather than 
the bleached paper pulp the company has used for its white filters. 
</P>
<P>
The company created its new filters because of "consumer demand for natural, 
environmentally benign products," said H. Helmut Radtke, president of Melitta 
North America. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups recently have expressed concern that some bleached papers 
contain too much dioxin, a toxic chemical. 
</P>
<P>
Melitta officials say levels of dioxin in their bleached paper coffee filters 
"can only be measured in parts per trillion," according to tests by the 
company, the Federal Health Ministry in West Germany, the Environmental 
Protection Agency in Washington and the American Paper Institute. "The 
governmental agencies have concluded that this is too low to pose any health 
threat," a Melitta representative said. 
</P>
<P>
Melitta advises that taste-tests of its natural brown filters have shown that 
some consumers find coffee brewed in them to be slightly milder than coffee 
made in the bleached paper models. 
</P>
<P>
The natural filters cost a little more than white models. They are available in 
the No. 2, 4 and 6 cone sizes in 40 per package and the basket size in 100. 
Suggested retail prices are $2.19, $2.29, $2.39 and $1.99 respectively. They 
can be purchased nationwide in supermarkets, department stores or gourmet 
specialty stores. LYNN SIMROSS

CONSUMER VIEWS: IRS RULING HAS TAXING CONSEQUENCES ON EXPENSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON G. CAMPBELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: In 1986, my husband and I paid $3,919.93 for prepaid funeral 
expenses. Since then the money has earned $563.24 in interest and, if we live 
another 10 years, the mortuary will collect another $2,515 plus compound 
interest. Presumably this money will pay whatever the funeral expenses are at 
the time. However, I'm sure the survivor will never get the difference. In the 
meantime, we are paying taxes on the interest. It seems to me that the mortuary 
should pay the tax because they have the use of the money. This year it cost us 
$30 extra in taxes. Is there any law regarding this matter? -- E.K. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: There is indeed, but you won't like it. It isn't really a "law," 
according to Jim Allen, executive officer in Sacramento for the California 
Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers, but an Internal Revenue Service 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
"The IRS takes the position," Allen says, "that even though the individual 
never intends to receive the income, partially or in full, the increase in 
valuation is to his benefit and, therefore, taxable to him." "Consumers," Allen 
adds in masterful understatement, "don't tend to look at it that way." 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have been trying by phone to find a Better Business Bureau in Los Angeles 
and was told by the operator that it was closed a year ago. I wonder if you 
could print the address of one. -- J.V. 
</P>
<P>
A: The operator was right: The Better Business Bureau of Los Angeles and Orange 
counties was closed in November, 1987. It went out of business when its 
membership plummeted from about 6,800 to about 3,000 and it ran out of money. 
Thus, L. A. became the largest city in the country without a BBB. 
</P>
<P>
Six months later, however, a successor BBB was formed in Cypress to serve both 
Los Angeles and Orange counties. All I can do is pass along their two telephone 
numbers, both of which yielded nothing but busy signals for three days. The 
general number is (714) 527-0680; the number "for complaints" is (714) 
527-0783. 
</P>
<P>
If you succeed in getting through on the "complaint" line, you'll get a taped 
message about how to file. (You have to send a stamped, self-addressed, long 
envelope to P.O. Box 669, Cypress, Calif. 90630, for a form. Letters describing 
a complaint are not acceptable.)

It was business as usual at the top of the TV chart that the A.C. Nielsen Co. 
released Tuesday, with NBC boasting seven of last week's 10 most watched 
programs -- starting with its Thursday night comedies. It was the 55th 
consecutive week that NBC placed first. The full list of ratings is on Page 8. 
</P>
<P>
* There was bigger news further down the chart, however, as the Fox network 
attracted what it said was its biggest audience share ever Sunday night. Both 
"America's Most Wanted" at 8 p.m. and the premiere of "Totally Hidden Video" at 
8:30 p.m. drew 20% of the available viewers to finish second in the time period 
ahead of NBC and ABC. Only CBS' "Murder, She Wrote" fared better.

Madonna's controversial "Like a Prayer" video and Neil Young's 
commercial-spoofing "This Note's for You" clip, which MTV resisted showing last 
year before eventually putting it into its broadcast rotation, are among the 
five finalists for the best video in the 24-hour music TV channel's 1989 Music 
Video Awards. Nominees were announced Tuesday and the winners will be revealed 
in a live telecast from the Universal Amphitheatre on Sept. 6, hosted by 
Arsenio Hall. The other nominees in the top category are Fine Young Cannibals' 
"She Drives Me Crazy," Michael Jackson's "Leave Me Alone" and Steve Winwood's 
"Roll With It." Paula Abdul's "Straight Up" led the field with six nominations, 
including best female performer, dance and new performer, while Jackson's 
"Leave Me Alone" and "Smooth Criminal" took seven nominations combined. ALEENE

An art exhibit featuring a nude baseball player has touched off another 
controversy in Chicago, the third time in three years that the nation's 
third-largest city has been the scene of an art display some find 
objectionable. Protesters have been out in force at the Chicago Public Library 
Cultural Center since the exhibition, "Diamonds Are Forever: Artists and 
Writers on Baseball," went on view. The painting, "Boys at Bat" by American 
artist Eric Fischl, depicts a boy in a baseball uniform, a picnic table and a 
frontal nude of a man swinging a baseball bat. Chicago Cultural Affairs 
Commissioner Joan Harris described the show as a traveling exhibition of 100 
artworks and literary passages organized by the New York State Museum and the 
Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Services. It is scheduled to be on 
display through Sept. 9 at the Cultural Center. Two previous displays at the 
Art Institute of Chicago also were controversial. Earlier this year, an exhibit 
by an art student invited people to step on an American flag placed on the 
floor. The display brought daily demonstrations from several veterans' groups 
and some state lawmakers. Last year, a painting of the late Chicago Mayor 
Harold Washington in women's lingerie touched off another flap. Several members 
of the City Council stormed the Art Institute and removed the painting. ALEENE

Randall Terry, the founder of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, which 
staged demonstrations at the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta last 
summer, has been arrested in that city on charges stemming from the protests. 
Operation Rescue spokesman Joseph Foreman said Terry was a "political 
prisoner." Foreman said there were no plans to post the required $50,000 bond 
to release Terry, who was charged with one count of being party to a crime and 
three counts of criminal trespass stemming from the demonstrations. His 
Binghamton, N.Y.-based group has sponsored numerous protests nationwide. Terry 
was arrested after he finished an appearance before the Christian Booksellers 
Assn. to promote a book.

Mayor Coleman A. Young, citing Detroit as the nation's chief victim of racist 
abandonment, told the NAACP its pursuit of freedom faces challenges as strong 
as when it was founded 80 years ago. Young, elected Detroit's first black mayor 
in 1973, said blacks who poured into Detroit to fill the automobile plants were 
"seeking jobs and freedom." Now, he said, jobs are moving out of the country 
and "freedom is being undermined by the Supreme Court" and by policies of 
former President Ronald Reagan. Gov. James J. Blanchard told the Detroit 
convention Michigan will continue affirmative action and set-aside programs 
despite adverse decisions from the high court.

The South Korean government reportedly asked the U.N. command guarding the 
border to block a radical student who plans to cross from North Korea as a 
symbol of national reunification. Im Suk Yong, 20, traveled to North Korea in 
defiance of Seoul to attend a youth festival, and said she intends to walk 
through the truce village of Panmunjom between the two Koreas on July 27, the 
anniversary of the cease-fire that ended the Korean War in 1953. Under the 
armistice, approval from both sides is needed to cross the demilitarized zone. 
The chairman of the south's governing party said there will be trouble if the 
north permits Im to cross the zone.

The World Jewish Congress, which opened its first office in a Communist country 
this week, could open one in the Soviet Union in the near future, the group's 
president said. The new office, opened Monday in Budapest, Hungary, is designed 
to work with Hungary's 80,000 Jews and with the small Jewish populations in 
other East European countries outside the Soviet Union. "My guess is that (we) 
will have an office in the Soviet Union within the next two years," Edgar M. 
Bronfman, the group's president, said. But he said Soviet Jews, estimated to 
number at least 1.8 million, would first have to become more organized.

The State Department accused Nicaragua's Sandinista government of harassing 
reporters, opposition figures and election observers, and it called for a halt 
to such activity so that balloting set for next February can be credible. 
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Washington is "very concerned about 
the way things are going in Nicaragua. Sandinista harassment . . . whether done 
through brute force or through the use of transparent legalisms, must cease." 
Among the incidents cited by Boucher was an attack on two correspondents from 
La Prensa last month in the city of Leon.

Afghan President Najibullah directed his troops to lay down their arms for four 
days in observance of a Muslim holy period coinciding with the hajj pilgrimage 
to Mecca. Guerrillas rejected the four-day cease-fire, saying their "Eid 
(feast) will be when an Islamic government replaces Najibullah." The guerrillas 
are keeping Kabul, the capital, under sustained rocket attack, and they 
launched a counterattack on the military base of Samarkhel, near Jalalabad in 
eastern Afghanistan, which was captured by the government last week.

Some Soviet conscripts will be let out of part of their military service and 
students will be allowed to finish their studies before being inducted, Premier 
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov told the Supreme Soviet, the nation's legislature. He said 
that 175,500 students called up between 1986 and 1989 will be released from 
service in August and September to continue their studies. Under certain 
conditions some students may not have to return to the military after 
completing their courses. The move, reflecting a more liberal attitude toward 
conscription, was widely applauded by the Supreme Soviet, which passed a 
resolution approving the measure with virtually no opposition.

A group of Azerbaijanis were ambushed, apparently by Armenians, and two were 
shot and killed as ethnic strife flared again in the troubled southern Soviet 
region of Nagorno-Karabakh, the Soviet news agency Tass reported. A third 
Azerbaijani was seriously injured in the attack near the village of Kirkidzhan. 
In a separate incident, soldiers trying to clear roads around Stepanakert, the 
main city of Nagorno-Karabakh, were pelted by stones and shot at with hunting 
rifles, and 19 suffered injuries, Tass said. Nagorno-Karabakh is predominantly 
Armenian and Christian, although it is located within the predominantly Muslim 
republic of Azerbaijan.

As thefts of automobile accessories increase across the nation -- about $1.3 
million such crimes were reported in 1988 -- Southern California motorists are 
going to great lengths to keep their hardware on their cars. 
</P>
<P>
But it's not easy keeping a car intact these days. That's especially true for 
Mercedes-Benz and Cadillac owners whose car emblems are most popular among 
teen-agers who like to wear the Mercedes three-pointed star or the Cadillac 
wreath as necklaces, belt buckles and key chains. 
</P>
<P>
"It's somewhat of a craze, I think," Lt. Greg Vasquez of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Burglary Auto Theft Division said. "The kids wear them as 
ornaments. It's like a status symbol, a trendy thing to have in your 
possession. It's done in all segments of the city." 
</P>
<P>
In the city of Los Angeles last year, LAPD statistics show there were 13,868 
thefts from vehicles, which includes hood ornaments and hub caps. But some 
police officers believe that figure is low, because hood ornament thefts often 
go unreported. 
</P>
<P>
The latest theft-deterrent device is an alarm that sounds the car horn if 
someone tries to steal the wired-up hood ornament. Manufactured by Celebrity 
Inc. of Placerville, it fits all American-made cars with vertical hood 
ornaments; another model fits all Mercedes-Benz models. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Removable Emblem 
</P>
<P>
For Mercedes-Benz, there also is a removable emblem available. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to customer demand, Beverly Hills Motoring Accessories recently 
began offering removable Mercedes-Benz hood stars. Gold plated models cost 
$129; chrome, $99. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to offer removable ones, like the portable car stereos, because so 
many customers requested it," Kathryn Johns of Beverly Hills Motoring 
Accessories said. "It's really a big problem for the Mercedes owners. It's $100 
every time they lose one. This way, they can just stick it in their pocket when 
they leave the car." 
</P>
<P>
Rolls-Royce's Flying Lady ornaments get ripped off, too, but they're too heavy 
to be worn around the neck, leading some dealers to suspect that the stolen 
emblems get sold into some auto parts black market, as do Rolls-Royce hubcaps, 
which cost $1,200 a set. 
</P>
<P>
"Locally, Mercedes stars are as popular as necklaces," Newport Auto Center 
Rolls-Royce dealer Roger Fletcher observed. "But no one walks around with a 
5-pound Flying Lady around his neck." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$500 to Replace 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles exotic car parts dealer said: "Everybody I know with a Rolls has 
had a Flying Lady stolen. They used to be made of solid silver, but they're 
silver-plated now; even those cost $500 or $600 to replace. Five years ago, a 
guy came in with 130 stainless steel knockoffs (of the ornament) made in Korea 
and I bought them for $10 apiece. I just sold the last one for $225." 
</P>
<P>
In Europe, both Rolls-Royce and Bentley autos have factory-made devices 
attached to the Flying Lady and Flying B that make the ornaments disappear down 
into the radiator if someone grabs them and tries to steal them. The devices 
are not included on Rolls and Bentleys manufactured for American distribution. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Cadillac dealers report a flurry of emblem thefts, especially 
since the ornaments -- also Cadillac grills and wheel covers -- became 
available nine years ago in gold plate in addition to chrome. 
</P>
<P>
"One night in the used car section, we lost every hood ornament in a whole 
row," said Chuck Nelson, tire and accessories manager for Dixon Cadillac in 
Hollywood. "Customers are always losing them. One guy lost four in a week. I 
tell them 'Don't even bother to replace it unless you get an alarm.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Everybody Takes Them' 
</P>
<P>
Dixon sales representative Bob Petrie, who had two emblems stolen from his 
Cadillac Seville before installing an alarm, added: "Everybody takes them, the 
kids on up to adults. If they don't get a gold one, they take the chrome ones 
and get them gold-plated." 
</P>
<P>
Cadillac's hood ornament theft problem is unique among General Motors cars. The 
penta star Chrysler emblem is stolen only "occasionally," Los Angeles Chrysler 
representative Chris Hosford said. 
</P>
<P>
But for Mercedes owners, ornament theft is a big problem. "At some Mercedes 
dealerships they're selling 20 hood ornaments a day," said Doug Furuye of D. F. 
Auto Leasing and Sales in Culver City. "That's how bad the theft problem is. 
One young lady picked up her 260E Mercedes from me late one afternoon and went 
back to her office. When she came out that evening, the star had been ripped 
off. She got another one the next day, and the following day, it was taken." 
</P>
<P>
Since he heard about the hood alarm a few months ago, he has recommended it to 
everyone who leases or buys a Cadillac or Mercedes from him. "People have tried 
alarm systems for the whole car that are sensitive to motion," he said. 
"They're about $250 to $600 if they're worth anything. But most of the time, 
they're too sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hood Ornaments 
</P>
<P>
Many Cadillac and Mercedes dealers offer the hood ornament alarm, which 
includes a 24-karat electroplated gold emblem, for about $195 installed. 
Motorists who want to save money on the devices can buy them for $59.95 from 
the Placerville company and take the 45 or so minutes it takes to install, said 
Curt Rocca, executive vice president of Celebrity Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers, he said, "are stealing the ornaments to wear around their necks, 
not for the value of the gold. We've heard about clubs at junior high schools 
where you had to have a Cadillac or Mercedes hood ornament just to belong. You 
needed one gold one or three chrome ones." 
</P>
<P>
Stealing a hood ornament is "a three-second operation," Rocca added. "You pull 
up on them and clip the cable with wire cutters. (But) the alarm comes with a 
heavy duty cable that you'd need bolt-cutters to take. Plus, there's the added 
surprise effect when the horn starts honking. One guy told me he saw a kid 
start to steal his hood ornament and when the horn went off, the kid jumped 
back 4 feet and ran."

CATALOGUES ARE LURING A NEW TYPE OF SHOPPER: BUSY WOMEN INTERESTED IN HIGH 
STYLE, QUALITY FABRICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
This summer, it's possible to do all your fall shopping at the beach. Just pack 
a stack of fashion catalogues along with the sunscreen. 
</P>
<P>
In case you haven't looked through a mail-order catalogue lately, there are 
some pleasant surprises. Especially among the newer books on the market. 
Companies such as Tweeds, J. Crew, and Lands' End have targeted a whole new 
audience: modern urbanites with more sophisticated tastes who are looking for 
ways to save time and cut down on the inconveniences of shopping the stores. 
</P>
<P>
The best of the new breed of catalogues are crowded with clothes made from 
natural fibers, in updated styles. There are none of the dowdy house dresses 
and polyester pant suits usually associated with shopping by mail. They've been 
replaced by items such as trendy, lace-trimmed leggings and man-tailored, 
cotton terry-cloth robes, stylish walking-short suits and oversize T-shirts in 
fashionable shades like melon, strawberry and conch. 
</P>
<P>
Such spirited styles, along with the higher-quality materials baby boomers are 
known to favor, are helping to lure in the sales. People who never thought 
they'd buy anything through the mail are attracted not only by the clothes but 
by such standard mail-order catalogue conveniences as 24-hour shopping by 
phone, fast delivery and hassle-free return policies. Some companies, including 
Spiegel, will send UPS to pick up the rejects at your door, free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
Surveys indicate that the most active catalogue customers are women ages 25 to 
40, many of them professionals with little time for anything other than 
juggling a career and a family. They usually order $100 worth of merchandise at 
a time. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California is considered to be a particularly fast-growing market, 
industry watchers report. The number of Los Angeles mail-order shoppers 
increased 20% in 1988 for Talbots, a preppie fashion company based in Hingham, 
Mass., with a catalogue as well as a retail division. Monet LeMon of Talbots 
reports that the company has 139 shops across the country and uses catalogue 
sales figures to determine where to open their next shop. There are two new 
Talbots stores scheduled to open in Southern California by October. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
8,500 Orders a Day 
</P>
<P>
"We try to be trend right, but not trendy," said LeMon, who explained that the 
company will ship 70 million catalogues this year. In response, 8,500 shoppers, 
with an average age of 43, will call in orders each day. 
</P>
<P>
With the number of enthusiasts nationwide steadily growing, industry analysts 
now project that some 11 billion fashion catalogues will be delivered to 
mailboxes across the country this year. And the major catalogue companies 
anticipate phenomenal sales figures. L.L. Bean, the granddaddy of the genre, 
especially in the area of rugged outdoor wear, is expecting $500 million in 
sales. Victoria's Secret, part of the giant The Limited operation, will bring 
in about the same, say Wall Street analysts. Along with sexy lingerie, the 
catalogue now includes cotton knit weekend wear and a selection of dressier 
dresses. 
</P>
<P>
Lands' End, an exclusively mail-order business with warehouse outlets but no 
retail stores, expects sales to hit $300 million in 1989. Like Spiegel, Lands' 
End has recently changed its look, from very basic styles to snappier, updated 
classics. 
</P>
<P>
All such efforts seem to be paying off. "The confidence in buying by mail is 
increasing," said Maxwell Sroge, a Chicago-based mail-order consultant. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a catalogue addict," said Marcy Axness with a laugh. "Every time the UPS 
man shows up, my husband rolls his eyes because he sees money flying out the 
door." 
</P>
<P>
Axness, 33, is an ideal example of a catalogue shopper. On hiatus from her 
career as a television writer, Axness cares for a 23-month-old son, Ian, and is 
directing the remodeling of the family's Larchmont Village home. She said she 
is just too busy to battle the traffic in and around the malls. 
</P>
<P>
She and other devoted mail-order shoppers acknowledge that without being able 
to try things on, they do return quite a few items. But, shoppers say, most 
catalogue companies are happy to reimburse the shipping costs if you ask them 
to. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
High Fashion, Low Price 
</P>
<P>
Even fashion retailers who specialize in high-price labels say they can relate 
to the catalogue shopping craze. "I love Tweeds," says Madeleine Gallay, owner 
of a European fashion boutique in Los Angeles that bears her name. While she 
wears clothes from her own shop exclusively, she encourages the stylish young 
women on her staff to shop by catalogue for a high-fashion look at a lower 
price. 
</P>
<P>
Gallay, who describes catalogue clothes as a mix of classic and funky, sees 
them as wardrobe basics -- especially items such as roomy, cotton cardigan 
sweaters and lace-trimmed leggings. And she notes that her fashion standards 
are high. 
</P>
<P>
"I really think people should buy nothing but the best," says Gallay. "I want 
to sell them a $1,000 dress to wear over their $19 leggings." 
</P>
<P>
The lace-trimmed leg wear she refers to -- described in the Tweeds catalogues 
available in shades from maple to conch -- has become something of a trendy 
dresser's staple in Los Angeles this summer. Women wear the lacy leggings 
peeking out from beneath the hem of a skirt. 
</P>
<P>
Other catalogue items that seem to be in high demand among Los Angeles 
mail-order shoppers are summer T-shirts and cotton turtlenecks, cotton-Lycra 
leggings, pure cotton camisoles and wide-leg cotton shorts. 
</P>
<P>
To keep up with the competition, more and more upscale specialty stores now 
ship high-fashion catalogues to their customers. In recent years they have even 
added high-price, designer-label merchandise to the bland selection once 
associated with catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Growing Popularity 
</P>
<P>
Industry consultant Sroge explains why: Mail-order apparel sales are growing at 
a rate of about 20% a year, nearly double the growth rate of retail apparel 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
Virtually every major retailer -- I. Magnin, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom, 
Neiman-Marcus, Robinson's, May Co., Bullock's and Bloomingdale's -- now 
publishes several catalogues each year. Alvin Somers, senior vice-president of 
I. Magnin's direct mail and marketing division, said publishing a catalogue is 
simply another way to reach store shoppers. Somers and other mail-order 
executives said they are aware of the growing popularity of catalogue shopping, 
but they denied that it cuts deeply into store sales. 
</P>
<P>
"For some people, shopping becomes a kind of walking theater and you cannot get 
that experience in a catalogue," said one executive. 
</P>
<P>
Given the upscale movement in the business, several prospering catalogue 
companies now feature European-inspired, natural-fiber fashions for men and 
women. In its fall book, Tweeds is showing oversize lambs' wool cardigans, 
shawl-collared blouses and pleated pants, belted with textured leather in 
European looks. Many of its deep-hued clothes are unisex and all have a soft, 
comfortable look. 
</P>
<P>
Tweeds president Jeff Aschkenes and company chairman Ted Pamperin formerly 
worked for a mail-order competitor, J. Crew. They left that family-owned 
company to start their own, more "fashion forward" operation. 
</P>
<P>
Women who wear classic American clothes but want a little more sophistication 
write to J. Crew, headed by 28-year-old Emily Cinader. Cinader, a prep-school 
graduate who studied finance and marketing at the University of Denver, serves 
as president and chief designer. She recently added evening and career clothes 
scheduled to debut in August. But the company is known for classic weekend 
wear. 
</P>
<P>
Cinader's personal preference for simple elegance is reflected in her all-black 
evening line. The 12 new styles, some strapless, are made up in lush fabrics 
including silk georgette and cashmere. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to black, Cinader said, J. Crew's fall palette includes dark and 
light greens, camel, ivory and a pale mauve called quartz. Her favorite accent 
colors are citrus, berry, mango, jade, red and lime green. 
</P>
<P>
This year J. Crew projects sales of between $150 million and $200 million. In 
addition, the company will open its first storefronts, including in San 
Francisco and in Costa Mesa, next October. 
</P>
<P>
Other all-American looks are available at Lands' End, where Oxford-cloth 
shirts, sleek tank suits and 100% cotton terry robes are staples. A 
calf-length, cotton terry bathrobe in the current Lands' End catalogue is 
priced at $57.50. Similar styles can range in price to well over $100 in 
specialty store catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
As competition heats up between companies that are primarily mail order, and 
those that are primarily retail, shoppers will benefit as the perks become ever 
more appealing. Bloomingdale's, whose Christmas catalogue has long been 
considered a luxury liner among mail-order books, now allows shoppers to 
purchase evening gowns from the office, if they order by fax.

BROCCOLI, PRODUCER OF BOND FILMS, HAS HIS DAY IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD ROUILARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Well, at last. Monday was Albert (Cubby) Broccoli Day in Los Angeles. The 
producer of the James Bond films was feted at the premiere of the latest, 
"Licence to Kill," through an evening that began at about 6 p.m. at the 
Directors Guild of America building and ended long after midnight at the Bel 
Age Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone was there, including Mayor Bradley, complete with a Broccoli Day 
proclamation. Broccoli, whose career spans more than half a century and 27 
films, has a great many friends in The Biz, and nearly all of them showed up 
(except two of the Bonds -- Sean Connery and Roger Moore). When all the 
celebrants crushed into the Directors Guild cocktail arena (which doubles as a 
theater lobby at less festive times), conversation can get heated. And so can 
the celebrants. Add in most of the press corps of the Western world, with 
flashbulbs and minicams, for an extra-hot event. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wary of Questions 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bradley was cooking. He deflected deftly all requests to name his 
favorite Bond film. "I'm smart enough as a politician not to identify any one 
of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As this was also a premiere of Broccoli's latest Bond film, starring Timothy 
Dalton, everyone was wary of questions regarding their favorite Bond, although 
Broccoli was brave enough to remark that the golden-throated Dalton is "the 
best actor of the lot." 
</P>
<P>
(A random furtive sample taken on the scene demonstrated, however, that Sean 
Connery is still the favorite.) 
</P>
<P>
Broccoli found himself a bit puzzled by all the festivities. "I don't know what 
it's all about. And I'm getting nervous." 
</P>
<P>
Dalton, chatting in a corner, suggested that the women should be asked to 
determine why he is "so attractive." And modest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Like a Roast 
</P>
<P>
Dalton said that the Bond films endure because "Mr. Broccoli has never cheaply 
exploited any of his previous films." And this, once again, was the case with 
"Licence to Kill," applauded over and over again by the audience, which 
included "Licence" beauties Talisa Soto and Carey Lowell and former Bond 
heroes, heroines, villains and villainesses including Richard ("Jaws") Kiel, 
Maud Adams, John Rhys-Davies, Lois Chiles, Patrick Macnee, Martine Beswick and 
Grace Jones. And there was Miss Moneypenny herself, Lois Maxwell, plus 
celebrities galore, not to mention Ringo Starr. 
</P>
<P>
After the screening, the more than 400 guests squeezed into the banquet 
facilities at the Bel Age Hotel to pay tribute to Broccoli. It was more like a 
roast. Macnee emceed. Wayne Newton, whose first major motion picture this was 
(he plays Professor Joe Butcher), was just beside himself. "Gosh, this is 
great!" he said as Macnee took to the podium to introduce David Picker, the 
former head of United Artists, who gave the go ahead to "Dr. No" back in 1962.

KPWR, THOMAS ON TOP -- ARBITRON POLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KPWR-FM(105.9) is still ruling the airwaves as it has for the past two years, 
according to the latest quarterly audience survey, released Tuesday by Arbitron 
Ratings Service. And Jay Thomas, morning drive-time deejay for the station that 
calls itself "Power 106," has overtaken Rick Dees of rival KIIS-FM (102.7) as 
the Los Angeles area's top-rated morning personality. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, KIIS slipped from No. 2 to No. 4 in the ratings, slightly above the 
newest rock station, KQLZ-FM "Pirate Radio" (100.3), which jumped to No. 5 in 
the ratings with a 62% increase in listenership from the previous quarter. 
</P>
<P>
KOST-FM (103.5), which plays "easy listening" hits, has taken over KIIS' No. 2 
spot. KABC-AM (790), Southern California's well-established talk station, came 
in at No. 3, maintaining its stronghold as the only talk station in the top 
five. 
</P>
<P>
Although this quarter generally did not differ markedly from previous ratings 
periods, the most startling development was hard-rocking newcomer KQLZ. "Pirate 
Radio" scuttled its easy-listening format on March 17 and, amid a major 
advertising blitz, has drawn audiences tired of deejay banter, commercials and 
dance music. 
</P>
<P>
For its first 10 days, the station, which program director and morning deejay 
Scott Shannon decribes as "free-form Top 40," had no commercial interruptions 
and it still has fewer ads than other rock stations. 
</P>
<P>
KIIS, known for its big-money giveaways and top 40 playlist, had ranked No. 2 
in the previous quarter and No. 3 for the two previous periods. KIIS officials 
were unavailable for comment on the station's ratings drop. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the Top 10 provided few changes from the previous quarter, with 
"easy listening" (also known as adult-contemporary) formats placing high. 
Besides KOST, KBIG-FM (104.3) came in at No. 6, followed by another 
easy-listening station, KJOI-FM (98.7). 
</P>
<P>
The Arbitron survey covered a 12-week period from March 30 through June 21 and 
based its data on information recorded by listeners in personal diaries over a 
seven-day period. 
</P>
<P>
"Power 106," the teen dance music station, has been No. 1 in Arbitron surveys 
for the past eight quarters, according to promotions manager Jim Peterson, but 
Thomas has never before been the top-rated morning morning deejay. 
</P>
<P>
Top morning drive-time personalities behind Thomas were KABC's Ken Minyard and 
Bob Arthur and KLOS-FM's (95.5) Mark Thompson and Brian Phelps. Dees was 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
The quarter saw several other format changes besides KQLZ's. Former rock 
station KEDG-FM (101.9) bought the easy-listening record library that KQLZ had 
been using as KIQQ, nicknamed K-LITE, and took over the nickname as well on May 
12. Since the switch, its ratings have dropped still lower, from .9 to .7 
despite a high-profile advertising campaign. 
</P>
<P>
KNX-FM, which changed its call letters to KODJ-FM (93.1) and its format from 
album-oriented rock to oldies on March 2, placed 17th, beating out "classic 
rock" station KLSX-FM (97.1), which came in 21st. KLSX tied with all-talk 
station KFI-AM (640), which, despite its stronger signal and promotional 
assaults, has not been able to come close to all-talk leader KABC. 
</P>
<P>
Here are the area's top 15 stations, followed by their ratings for the most 
recent spring quarter and the preceding winter quarter, as measured by 
Arbitron.

CRONKITE TO STAR IN AD PRAISING 'FREE' TELEVISION

Launching the first of two major campaigns to combat inroads made by cable 
television in their viewership and advertising support, the three major 
networks and commercial television stations on Monday will air an ad in which 
Walter Cronkite praises "free TV," officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time anything like this has ever happened," CBS spokesman 
George Schweitzer said, referring to the massive exposure for the commercial 
featuring the former CBS anchorman. 
</P>
<P>
The 30-second ad will air one time only at the start of prime time on Monday 
night. Schweitzer estimated that more than 1,000 stations will broadcast it as 
part of a yearlong effort by the National Assn. of Broadcasters to remind 
viewers of the virtues of over-the-air commercial television. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the broadcast industry's Television Bureau of Advertising said 
Tuesday that it will be launching a campaign of its own in Jan. 22 -- a series 
of "image commercials" for "free" TV that it estimated could be worth $100 
million in air time. 
</P>
<P>
That effort will feature eight commercials a week about what one official 
called "the value and impact" of over-the-air commercial TV.JAY SHARBUTT

PROTEST FROM POET'S ESTATE KEEPS FILM OUT OF GAY FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS SADOWNICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Horne could hardly contain his excitement at last winter's Berlin Gay and 
Lesbian Film Festival when he saw "Looking for Langston," director Isaac 
Julien's study of homosexuality during the Harlem Renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
"I considered it the first black gay feature film ever made," said Horne, the 
director and founder of the seventh Los Angeles International Gay and Lesbian 
Film and Video Festival, which runs through Sunday at the Directors Guild of 
America Theater in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Horne, who has shown all of the London-based Julien's previous films, had 
decided to open the festival with "Looking for Langston," which deals with 
intimate bonds between gay blacks and whites. Langston Hughes' poetry is 
presented as a voice-over in parts of the movie. The black poet died in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"It would set the tone," Horne proclaimed, "of a festival that was shaped along 
the themes of multi-culturalism." 
</P>
<P>
But Horne's dream recently fell apart when Ada Griffin, director of the New 
York-based Third World Newsreel, the distributor of "Langston," called and 
demanded that he not show the film. 
</P>
<P>
The Hughes estate sent a cease-and-desist letter to Julien in mid-June 
informing him that he would put Griffin, Horne's festival and himself in legal 
jeopardy if the film were screened. 
</P>
<P>
The cause for the crisis? Julien had secured the rights to quote Hughes' poetry 
in the film, but only for use in Britain. ("Langston" already has been shown on 
"Out on Tuesday," a gay series on Britain's Channel 4.) 
</P>
<P>
But according to Griffin, film maker Julien apparently wasn't aware of the 
resistance he would meet from the "black bourgeoisie" who, she feels, "see 
Hughes as a racial icon." 
</P>
<P>
"They (the estate) were appalled at any inference that Hughes might have been a 
homosexual and they wanted all mentions of him out," said Griffin from her New 
York office. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes' sexuality has long been debated among academics. Lately, an acclaimed 
biography of Hughes' life by Arnold Rampersad, published by Oxford University 
Press, was unable to confirm that Hughes was homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
However, the editors of "Gay and Lesbian Poetry of Our Time," published by St. 
Martin's Press, included four poems by Hughes in their anthology. 
</P>
<P>
Why the fuss then about "Langston"? 
</P>
<P>
According to Horne, "the power of celluloid is formidable, even if we're 
talking independent art films -- which is why I wanted to program this festival 
along multicultural themes." 
</P>
<P>
For Horne's part, "the absence of 'Langston' doesn't necessarily detract from 
the festival." Rather, he says that "the mess" points out how "much we still 
need gay and lesbian film festivals." 
</P>
<P>
Julien, who was contacted at his London production company, SanKoFa, seemed to 
take the pulling of the film from the festival in stride. 
</P>
<P>
"The Hughes estate had four major points of contention: that we delete all of 
Hughes' poetry, all mention of the estate in the credits of the film and all 
excerpts of Hughes reading his poetry on NBC television, as well as pay for the 
estate's legal expenses in suing us. 
</P>
<P>
"We will delete the poetry," Julien said. "I want the film to get shown -- and 
the film isn't so much about Hughes as it's about 'looking' for cultural pride. 
</P>
<P>
"But I will not comply with deleting the NBC footage because that is part of 
the public domain. And even though we are trying our best to act in good faith 
with the estate, we will not go so far as to pay for their expenses." 
</P>
<P>
Officials from Harold Ober Associates, an agency that represents the Hughes 
estate, refused to comment on the legal or social implications of their 
cease-and-desist letter when questioned by The Times.

VAN CLIBURN IN MOSCOW, SEEKS PIED-A-TERRE FOR FUTURE VISITS 
</P>

American pianist Van Cliburn, expansive and ebullient, fielded questions 
Tuesday from Soviet journalists about what he called his sentimental journey 
back to the Soviet Union and said he had noticed few changes in the 31 years 
since he was here last. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't notice if there are one car or two cars or three cars on the street," 
he said, gesturing broadly and grinning. "I care about friendships and art. 
There is a constancy about great art, and that's what I see here. Great art is 
an incredible buoy to hang onto in a turbulent sea." 
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old Texan also said his nearly decade-long break in performing was 
over and added that he had asked Soviet authorities to find him "a little 
pied-a-terre" so he could come back more often to perform in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I would have to work very hard in the first part of my life and then I 
wanted to take an intermission, just as if it were a concert, because I feel I 
will have to work very hard in the last part of my life. And now, I guess, I'm 
in the last part of my life," the lanky Cliburn said with a laugh to 
journalists assembled in the Foreign Ministry press center. 
</P>
<P>
Cliburn, who won the first Tchaikovsky International Piano Competition in 
Moscow in 1958, came out of retirement in 1987 to play for Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, during their visit to the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev invited him to Moscow, and he arrived last week. He has played 
charity concerts in both the capital city and Leningrad, and donated $10,000 
and 10,000 rubles to Soviet music conservatories and programs. 
</P>
<P>
Cliburn's audiences in the Soviet Union have been warm and the high recognition 
factor he enjoys here also was apparent at Tuesday's news conference. Soviet 
journalists, in their questions, praised repeatedly both his performances and 
his genial manner. "You are a great friend of our country," one said, while 
another mentioned his "charming smile." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Cliburn applauded the Gorbachevs for supporting the arts. He said 
he was not only flattered that the couple attended a concert he gave last week 
in Moscow, but also was impressed to see "the leader of a great country give 
himself or herself over to a night of classical music. . . . You have to have 
vision from the top for the arts to proceed and preserve." 
</P>
<P>
Because of its musical history, he said, visiting the Soviet Union is "somewhat 
like going to Mecca for a musician." 
</P>
<P>
Cliburn and his 92-year-old mother, who is traveling with him, met the 
Gorbachevs last week for 35 minutes backstage after he performed at Moscow's 
Tchaikovsky Hall. "I expressed a desire to have a pied-a-terre here because I 
will be coming more often and it might save me money if I have my own 
pied-a-terre," the pianist, who now lives in Fort Worth, said. 
</P>
<P>
Although there is a housing shortage in Moscow, Cliburn said he expects he will 
be supplied with an apartment. "They were very gracious," he said.

A&amp;M RECORDS OPENS ARMS TO NEW AMERICANA SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The notion of American musical heritage used to conjure images of old codgers 
in coveralls straight from the Appalachians, monitored by troops of earnest 
musical preservationists. 
</P>
<P>
Not to Steve Ralbovsky. 
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old A&amp;M Records senior vice president of artists &amp; 
repertoire is intent on sharing his belief that American music is a rich and 
varied living process, more vital and current today than ever. 
</P>
<P>
To that end, Ralbovsky this month is launching the Americana series, a label 
within A&amp;M designed to boost contemporary artists working with traditional 
forms. The inaugural Americana release will be "Homeland," the debut by Tish 
Hinojosa, a singer from San Marcos, Tex. Hinojosa writes about a cultural 
experience Ralbovsky believes is the essential shared element of all American 
culture and its musical forms. 
</P>
<P>
"Tish embodies a certain Southwestern experience that speaks to the immigrant," 
Ralbovsky said recently in his spare, airy office at A&amp;M's Hollywood 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
"She's one of 13 children who crossed the border from Mexico. Her song 'West 
Side of Town' is about the west side across the border at El Paso, but it 
relates to the west side of San Antonio or the west side of the San Fernando 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Next in the series will be an album by David Wilcox, an Asheville, N.C., 
singer-songwriter who was brought to Ralbovsky's attention by one of his 
network of "unofficial" talent scouts around the country. The third Americana 
release will be the major-label debut of Zachary Richard, a young Cajun star 
who has also been a crusader for the preservation of Cajun culture. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to make records with young progenitors, new artists who are returning 
to the native forms, but somehow contemporize them with new songs or performing 
abilities," Ralbovsky said. 
</P>
<P>
"Partly it was inspired by the annual New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, 
which has become a mecca for people with an interest in the essence of the 
music. And I've also seen an influence on the mainstream from ethnic American 
music like blues, folk and gospel." 
</P>
<P>
In just one year at A&amp;M, after a two-year stint as A&amp;R director at 
Columbia Records in New York, Ralbovsky established his leanings. He was behind 
the label's signing of the Neville Brothers, who are New Orleans R&amp;B kings, 
and a series of anthologies recorded at the Knitting Factory, New York's 
downtown avant-garde club (the first volume has just been released). 
</P>
<P>
He also worked closely on such projects as John Hiatt's "Slow Turning," and 
producer Hal Willner's lauded "Stay Awake" collection of unusual 
interpretations of Disney movie songs. He has been instrumental in re-releasing 
titles from the A&amp;M jazz catalogue and the establishment of a Jazz Masters 
series, which debuted recently with new albums by veteran jazz innovators Don 
Cherry and Sun Ra. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Ralbovsky felt a need to establish a special series. In forming the 
structure of the project, Ralbovsky took clues from small, independent, 
folk-oriented labels such as Rounder in the use of his informal network of 
scouts, small-budget recordings and alternative promotion avenues, such as 
National Public Radio. 
</P>
<P>
"These records will take 10% to 20% of the usual pop recording budget," he 
said. "They all can be profitable at very low sales numbers." 
</P>
<P>
But the key to Americana's prospects, Ralbovsky says, is to emphasize 
individual quality and avoid formula. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want a Chinese menu approach," he said. "I could have gone to New 
Orleans and signed 15 artists -- one gospel, one folk, one blues. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of focusing on styles, Ralbovsky is searching for individual talents. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at Robert Cray and Los Lobos and even Suzanne Vega, the early 
records were low-budget and somewhat ethnic, but through good songs they 
connected with an audience."

<P>
A 17-year-old youth was in stable condition Tuesday after being shot in the 
face when two carloads of gang members cornered him at La Habra Boulevard and 
Cypress Street, police said. The victim was not believed to be a member of a 
rival gang, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The confrontation started when the youth, who was not identified because of his 
age, stopped his car about 9 p.m. Monday, Police Lt. John Buchholz said. 
</P>
<P>
Two cars filled with gang members began following the victim, Buchholz said. 
One car wedged him into a corner and a gang member got out and used a 
small-caliber gun to shoot the youth in the face, Buchholz said. 
</P>
<P>
The teen-ager is expected to lose one of his eyes as a result of the attack, 
police said.

</P>
<P>
On Monday, Gonzalez was arrested at his residence in the 1880 block of Shetland

MAN, 27, KILLED IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 27-year-old Santa Ana man was killed by shotgun fire in what police said 
Tuesday was a random, drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Police identified the victim as Miguel Angel Guzman, who was fired upon about 
11:05 p.m. Monday as he walked in the 500 block of South Raitt Street. 
</P>
<P>
Guzman was the city's 28th homicide victim so far this year, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was walking down the street, and someone passing in a full-size, older 
model, dark vehicle drove by, slowed down and fired several shots," said police 
spokeswoman Maureen Thomas. "The victim sustained two gunshot wounds to his 
upper body. We don't know the weapon. We have very little to go on." 
</P>
<P>
Guzman was taken to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center and 
died a short time later, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel this was gang-related, but we won't know for sure without 
further investigation," she said.

TONY BRACES IN SOVIET FAR EAST FOR A 1,000-MILE LEG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

MAGADAN, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Aliengena reached the Soviet Far East's largest northern port Tuesday but 
braced for one of the most crucial legs on his round-the-world flight, as he 
moved closer to Alaska and U.S. re-entry. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-year-old San Juan Capistrano boy negotiated 312 miles of Pacific 
coastline to bring his single-engine Cessna to a safe landing at the airport 
outside Magadan, a fishing port of 185,000 people normally closed to 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
After resting on a one-day stopover, Tony is scheduled to climb back into the 
cockpit Thursday for a 1,000-mile flight to Anadyr, covering some of the Soviet 
Far East's most desolate terrain. 
</P>
<P>
With just one gravel airfield between those two coastal ports, Tony will be 
relying on the 1,500-mile range of his Cessna 210 Centurion to carry him safely 
over the mountains and dense forests. 
</P>
<P>
The route has a reputation for danger -- many U.S. and Soviet military fliers 
crashed there while ferrying planes between Alaska and the Soviet Union during 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with flying in the region is that fog and stormy weather can move 
in at any time, shrouding airstrips and making mountain peaks hard to see, said 
Boris Nikolaevitch, a journalist in the small Pacific village of Okhotsk, where 
Tony spent his first night in the Soviet Far East on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"The Far East has very, very savage weather," Nikolaevitch said. 
</P>
<P>
On Tony's 500-mile flight Monday from the eastern Siberian capital of Yakutsk 
to Okhotsk, weather was not a factor. Other than low-lying clouds over the 
ocean, weather was also not a problem for Tuesday's 312-mile leg between 
Okhotsk and Magadan. 
</P>
<P>
The weather on the remaining 1,200 miles through the Soviet Union remains a 
question mark, however. A team of Alaskan scientists visiting Magadan told 
Tony's entourage that dense fog had blanketed Providenia for the entire week 
they stayed there on a U.S.-Soviet archeological expedition. After Anadyr, Tony 
is scheduled to fly Friday to Providenia, a small fishing village at the Soviet 
Union's northeastern tip. 
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled Saturday to cross the Bering Strait and re-enter the United 
States at Nome, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
If Tony was feeling anxiety about the upcoming legs to Alaska, he was not 
showing it this week. "It's not dangerous," Tony said in Okhotsk, where 
hundreds of local residents applauded when he landed. 
</P>
<P>
Tony has received large, enthusiastic receptions all across the Soviet Union, 
but the one in Okhotsk was frenzied. Children thrust flowers and pens at him 
and adults burst into wild applause. 
</P>
<P>
Even the Red Army contributed. Uniformed troops used their amphibious assault 
vehicles to ferry Tony and his entourage across the mile-wide Kuhtuy River to 
Okhotsk, which can be reached only by ferry because the ever-changing river 
bottom cannot support a bridge. 
</P>
<P>
The entire town seemed to turn out, as a crowd of hundreds of men, women and 
children riding bicycles, motorbikes and walking trailed Tony and his entourage 
from a cafe -- where they dined on salmon, redfish and reindeer tongue -- to 
the local museum, where they were given a look at the region's colorful 
history. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Role in Bering's Discoveries 
</P>
<P>
The museum director, Yevgeniy Morokov, said Okhotsk (which means hunting place) 
was the port from which 18th-Century explorer Vitus Bering sailed to Alaska, 
thus becoming the first European to discover the strait that bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
The museum also featured wildlife specimens from the surrounding wilderness, 
where bears and wolves still prowl in such large numbers that outdoors 
enthusiasts are advised to carry firearms. 
</P>
<P>
Asked by the museum director to write a message in a book where the town's 
historical documents are kept, Tony's father wrote: "Your history will be in 
our hearts forever." 
</P>
<P>
Morokov then reached into his pocket and gave Tony a 3,000-year-old Indian 
arrowhead. Then he presented Tony's 10-year-old sister, Alaina, with seven 
precious stones found 200 years ago in Okhotsk. 
</P>
<P>
Morokov said the seven stones symbolized happiness, and he urged Alaina to make 
a necklace out of them. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the museum, the town's residents waited patiently for Tony to finish 
the tour. Eighth-grader Aleksie Manohin said he had been anticipating Tony's 
visit for a month. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Wish for Good Health 
</P>
<P>
"Very good, it's very interesting," Manohin said in awkward English. When asked 
what he had to say to Americans, the student blushed and said, "I wish them 
health, very big health." 
</P>
<P>
Nikolaevitch said Tony is a curiosity because normally the region is closed not 
only to foreigners but to outside Soviet residents as well, primarily because 
of its closeness to Japan and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Although the village's streets are worn and rutted, and many of the homes are 
clapboard shacks with outhouses, the residents earn a much higher salary than 
counterparts in such big cities as Moscow and Leningrad. Nikolaevitch, for 
instance, makes 500 rubles a month, while a journalist in Moscow may earn just 
half of that. 
</P>
<P>
In Magadan, the salmon fishing is legendary. One of the first orders of 
business for Tony's party was to arrange for an early morning fishing outing 
Wednesday. The rest of the group planned a tour of Magadan, where fog rolls in 
off the Pacific virtually every afternoon, even though the city is 30 miles 
inland. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from fishing, Magadan is also well known in the Soviet Union for it 
prisons, said Aleksie Grinevich, a Moscow journalist accompanying Tony on his 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Center for Stalinist Executions 
</P>
<P>
During the more restrictive Stalin era, he said, hundreds of thousands of 
Soviet dissidents were taken to Magadan for mass execution. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many, many prison songs in the Soviet Union written about Magadan," 
Grinevich said. 
</P>
<P>
Local Magadan officials greeting Tony at the airport said nothing about the 
area's notorious prison history. Instead, they scheduled a visit to a Young 
Pioneers camp and invited the Americans to stay in town until this weekend, 
when Magadan's 50th anniversary will be celebrated with music and dance. 
</P>
<P>
Tony politely declined. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Soviet Union," he said, "we have been to so many great places that if 
we had extended our stay we would never have gotten home."

SAN JOAQUIN TOLLWAY ADDS NEW CAR-POOL PLAN, TRAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, Times Urban Affairs Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A proposed new design for the 14-mile tollway linking Newport Beach and San 
Juan Capistrano calls for commuter trains in the median strip, as well as 
Orange County's first reversible car-pool lanes, which would route cars in 
either direction, depending on traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary design plan for the San Joaquin Hills tollway, which still 
would include three regular traffic lanes in each direction, will come before 
the agency overseeing the $556-million project on Thursday. If approved, the 
ambitious proposal will become one of several designs being studied as part of 
the tollway's environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether such rail service ultimately would be offered along the route would 
depend on the future availability of money for additional trains in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"This will allow commuters a great deal of flexibility and addresses many of 
our concerns about meeting regional clean-air goals," said Newport Beach 
Councilman John C. Cox Jr., chairman of the San Joaquin Hills Transportation 
Corridor Agency, a joint-powers authority that is overseeing the project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Reversible Feature Is Beautiful' 
</P>
<P>
"Not only will some people be able to use light rail, but if they are in van 
pools, buses or car pools, we can have them use the reversible lanes for the 
entire length of the corridor without making them stop at a toll booth," Cox 
said. "The reversible feature is beautiful because it would allow us to 
(better) handle peak traffic loads." 
</P>
<P>
Ride-share vehicles would be electronically tagged so that automatic-scanning 
equipment could identify them and send a tollway users' bill to the appropriate 
vehicle operator by mail, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
The new design proposal will be recommended by the tollway design staff to the 
Corridor Agency board of directors at its monthly meeting on Thursday, Cox 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The much-delayed environmental report, which has been rewritten and revised, is 
scheduled for public circulation again in March, 1990. Construction, Cox said, 
would not be delayed by this new design proposal or by plans to combine the 
state-mandated environmental impact report with a federal environmental study, 
a process that some corridor officials previously wanted to avoid in order to 
speed the project to completion. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the tollway, which will connect the Corona del Mar Freeway at 
MacArthur Boulevard in Newport Beach to Interstate 5 in San Juan Capistrano, is 
now scheduled to begin in January, 1991, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Corridor Design 
</P>
<P>
A new design proposed for the San Joaquin Hills tollway envisions commuter 
trains in the median strip and 2 reversible car-pool lanes. The toll road still 
would have 3 regular mixed-flow lanes in each direction.

of a Pacific winter storm last week in the Southern Hemisphere. Lifeguards were 
kept busy with rescues of swimmers caught in rip currents, and said the

PLACENTIA DUPLEX HEAVILY DAMAGED BY BLAZE;

<P>
YOUTH'S SCREAMS SAVE SISTERS FROM FIRE

A 12-year-old Placentia boy screamed to alert his two older sisters Tuesday 
when a fast-moving fire swept through their duplex, sending them to safety. 
</P>
<P>
The fire apparently started just before noon when grease flared up in the 
kitchen of one of two rental units in the 2300 block of Blackfoot Avenue, 
according to Orange County Fire Department spokeswoman Maria Sabol. 
</P>
<P>
Flames spread through a common attic to the other unit, damaging a bedroom. The 
fire caused at least $180,000 in damage to the units, leaving the boy's family 
homeless, Sabol said. 
</P>
<P>
Lucy Broad, 18, said she was asleep in her bedroom when she awoke to her 
brother Jason's voice. 
</P>
<P>
"He started screaming, 'Fire!' "Broad said. "Then I saw this big wall of 
flame." 
</P>
<P>
Broad, Jason and their sister, Natasha, 16, who was in her bedroom when the 
fire broke out, escaped without injury as flames leaped to the roof. Their 
mother, Patricia, was not home. 
</P>
<P>
"I just walked in and screamed," Jason said. "I wanted them to get out of the 
house. I knew if I screamed I could get everyone out." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Farley, who lives in the other apartment, returned home during the fire, 
Sabol said. It took 27 firefighters from the county, Brea and Anaheim 25 
minutes to control the blaze, she said. There was a smoke detector in the unit, 
but it apparently did not work, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The family was put up at a motel Tuesday by the American Red Cross before 
deciding where to stay. Their house will be demolished today, Broad said, but 
the owner said it would be rebuilt within three months. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Broad was at work Tuesday night and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Lucy Broad said the fire destroyed nearly all of the family's belongings, 
except for a few items in the garage. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very scary," Broad said. "I'm just very glad my brother was there to 
scream out."

NOVEL FEE SOUGHT TO CLEAN BAY 
</P>

<P>
A new financing plan, charging fees to homeowners and businesses for their 
pollution, was proposed by Los Angeles city officials Tuesday to clean up one 
of the worst sources of Santa Monica Bay contamination -- runoff from streets, 
sidewalks, parking lots and other paved and built-over areas. 
</P>
<P>
The plan was developed by city public works officials and aides to Mayor Tom 
Bradley and Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica). 
</P>
<P>
Runoff of rain and other water polluted by street, motor vehicle and animal 
waste and other urban grime is one of the two biggest polluters of Santa Monica 
Bay. The other is sewage treated at the city's Hyperion plant. The quality of 
that plant's treatment, under a court order from the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, has improved sharply recently. 
</P>
<P>
Under the runoff treatment financing plan, special taxing districts would be 
created by the City Council, in which property owners would be assessed to 
finance new facilities to clean up the filthy water before it hits the bay. 
</P>
<P>
The special taxing areas, called benefit assessment districts, have been used 
for years to put up street lighting and make other civic improvements. They do 
not require votes by affected property owners. 
</P>
<P>
What is unique about this plan, city officials said, is that the taxes would be 
levied according to the amount of asphalt or concrete, or buildings, on a 
property. Such covering prevents storm water from percolating into the soil.

ANGELS' CLASS-A TEAM SURRENDERS ITS EQUIPMENT TO POLICE IN DISPUTE OVER HOTEL 
BILL 
</P>

<P>
The Quad City Angels, a Class-A team for the California Angels, had its 
equipment seized Monday night by police in South Bend, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels had just finished playing the South Bend White Sox when police 
entered the locker room and confiscated the equipment in a dispute over a bill 
with The Works Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Angels paid $2,700 to retrieve the seized property. 
</P>
<P>
"They have sent us a negotiable check yesterday, paid into court," hotel owner 
T. Brooks Brademas said. "So we released the equipment. Actually, there's been 
a lot of ado about nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Mike Tatoian, the club's general manager, said in a prepared statement that the 
money was paid solely to retrieve the equipment. Team officials said the club 
considers the seizure unwarranted and intends to take legal action against The 
Works Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to regain the baseball equipment necessary for our ballclub to 
compete during the upcoming road trip to Madison (Wis.), The Works Hotel was 
wired an amount equal to the billing of the three days (in question)," Tatoian 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began last season when the Angels reserved rooms at The Works for 
their June 27-30, 1988, series against the White Sox. Tatoian said the team 
found the hotel was not within walking distance to most downtown restaurants 
and never checked in. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a clear fabrication on their part," Brademas said. 
</P>
<P>
"Richard Harris and the Camelot troupe stayed here and Neil Diamond stayed 
here. They were all very, very pleased. We took those rooms out of circulation 
for three days and we lost income because of it." 
</P>
<P>
Tatoian said The Works rejected the club's offer to pay for one day. Hotel 
manager Joe Walsh said the organization never responded to correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to damage South Bend's image in the Midwest League," Walsh said. 
"We exercised every option, including going to the Midwest League office, 
before we pursued legal channels." 
</P>
<P>
"We went to the local courts and won a judgment," Brademas said. "The Angels 
were aware of this. We had informed them. They chose not to show up." 
</P>
<P>
Tatoian said Tuesday that club lawyers advised the team not to pay because the 
hotel's lawyers had sued the wrong name. The suit named the Quad City Angels. 
The franchise name actually is the Quad City Professional Baseball Club. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels returned to South Bend last week for a four-game series and on 
Monday, after an 8-2 loss to the White Sox, found the police in their locker 
room. 
</P>
<P>
The equipment, which included uniforms, bats and helmets, was seized as part of 
a default judgment awarded The Works Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Police sealed exits to the visiting team's clubhouse at Stanley Coveleski 
Regional Stadium and searched Quad City players as they left. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen anything like it, the cops taking stuff and going through our 
bags," said losing pitcher Mark Holzemer. 
</P>
<P>
Brademas said the seizure was the last resort. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the only way we could get it taken care of," said Brademas. "We don't 
intend to set up our own ball team. I guess they assumed since they were from 
another state, we couldn't enforce it." 
</P>
<P>
Tatoian said the seized equipment belonged to the California Angels, not the 
Quad City franchise. 
</P>
<P>
"If they felt they had to seize something, they can come here and get a popcorn 
cart," he said from the club's office in Davenport, Iowa.

SURF CLASSIC AT SAN CLEMENTE; 
</P>
<P>
HOGAN RECOVERS FROM INJURY, RIDES A WAVE OF SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
When the 1988 Professional Surfing Assn. of America season started, San 
Clemente High School graduate Jim Hogan was hoping for big things after 
finishing second in the Professional Surfing Assn. of America overall standings 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
All of that changed last June when Hogan, 26, suffered a hyperextended back, a 
punctured cervical disk and an injured sciatic nerve and a cervical disk while 
practicing near his home in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Hogan fought off the pain to finish second to fellow San Clemente High graduate 
Dino Andino in the Del Taco/Naugles Surf Classic last July in San Clemente, but 
failed to get into another final for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a matter of willpower that I was able to finish as high as I did 
in San Clemente last year," said Hogan, who will be competing in this year's 
$35,000 Surf Classic, which starts today near the San Clemente pier. 
</P>
<P>
"I stayed completely out of the water for as many as 2 1/2 to three weeks at a 
time between meets after getting hurt, but when it came time for me to compete, 
I would block the pain completely out mentally and do the best I could with 
what I had. 
</P>
<P>
"I made it into the semifinals several times after San Clemente, but even 
though I was pleased with having finished 1988 in third place overall (in the 
PSAA standings), I wasn't getting into the finals like I should have and that 
disappointed me. And my injuries had a lot to do with that." 
</P>
<P>
The pain and lack of success continued during the early part of the 1989 season 
for Hogan; he finished 17th in a PSAA event Feb. 26 at Isabella, Puerto Rico, 
and 49th at Haleiwa, Hawaii. But after he received a cortisone shot in early 
May, Hogan's fortunes changed. 
</P>
<P>
Freed from the excruciating pain caused by his multiple back injuries, Hogan 
scored his first victory in two years by taking an Assn. of Surfing 
Professionals event at St. Augustine, Fla., just a few days after getting his 
cortisone shot. 
</P>
<P>
Hogan's return to top form continued on May 21, when he finished fourth in a 
PSAA event in Santa Cruz, Then, after he came in ninth in a June 4 PSAA event 
in Oceanside, he went to Smyrna, Fla., where he finished third in an ASP World 
Tour contest. 
</P>
<P>
"My confidence is 100 percent back, back where it was (in 1985) when I won 19 
straight heats (a PSAA record)," Hogan said. "I feel like a little kid with 
candy, and I'm not about ready to let anyone take it away from me." 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
Dino Andino and Jim Hogan will be joined by two-time defending PSAA champion 
Mike Lambresi of Oceanside and Bud Llamas of Huntington Beach, this year's 
top-seeded surfer, among others, when the top 32 seeded surfers of the meet 
start competition in fifth-round action Saturday at 7 a.m. after drawing byes 
for the first four rounds. . . . Andino, who won the Surf and Street Mechanix 
Junior Pro Championship Saturday at Huntington Beach, came back the following 
day to win the $2,000 first prize in a contest near Ensenada, Mexico. . . . 
Competition will start at 7 a.m. each day through Sunday, with the finals set 
for Sunday at 2:20 p.m. . . . . The surfing winner will get $6,000, with the 
runner-up getting $3,000 and the third-place finisher $2,000. . . . Another 
two-time PSAA champion, Mike Stewart of Anaheim, will lead the bodyboarders in 
competition that starts Friday at 12:40 p.m. Stewart will be challenged by his 
longtime rival, second-seeded Ben Severson of Honolulu, and third-seed Jay 
Reale of San Clemente. Bodyboarding finals will be Sunday at 1:50 p.m., with 
the winner getting a $1,500 first prize.

GOLDSMITH BIDS $21 BILLION FOR BAT INDUSTRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
An investment group headed by flamboyant takeover specialist James Goldsmith 
launched an "unsolicited and unwelcome" $21.5-billion bid Tuesday for BAT 
Industries PLC, the British conglomerate that includes American subsidiaries 
ranging from Saks Fifth Avenue to Farmers Insurance Group Inc. of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
It is by far the biggest buyout ever attempted here, and London financial 
markets bet heavily Tuesday that the price may yet go high enough to rival last 
year's world record $25-billion purchase of RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis 
Roberts &amp; Co., a New York firm specializing in leveraged buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith said he intends to sell off BAT's non-tobacco interests, starting 
with the Farmers Group, which BAT acquired for $5.2 billion last Dec. 16 
following a protracted takeover battle. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers, California's second-largest and the nation's third-largest writer of 
personal lines of insurance, has 15,500 employees and another 15,000 agents and 
district managers with exclusive contracts to sell Farmers' products. The 
company's largest operation by far is in California. 
</P>
<P>
BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy promised a fight against the Goldsmith offer, 
calling it "no more than an ill-conceived attempt at destructive financial 
engineering." The company "considers this unsolicited and unwelcome offer to be 
of dubious value," according to a BAT press release, which added, "It should be 
rejected." 
</P>
<P>
An expectant British business community has been awaiting a high-stakes 
Goldsmith grab for some company ever since he announced his return to the 
London financial scene last March in partnership with his old friend, financier 
Jacob Rothschild. 
</P>
<P>
But the size of his quarry clearly stunned the City, as London's equivalent of 
the Wall Street financial district is called.

BAT (formerly British American Tobacco) shares closed up by more than 30%, at 
906 pence (the equivalent of $14.77) a share Tuesday after trading earlier at 
as much as 940 pence ($15.32). Both figures were well above the 850 pence 
($13.86) a share offered by Goldsmith's group, indicating that the City expects 
the bidding to go higher in what analysts said is shaping up as a titanic 
battle for control. 
</P>
<P>
Also in on the deal with Goldsmith and Rothschild is Kerry Packer, a colorful 
Australian entrepreneur and owner of Consolidated Press Holdings. The three are 
the principal members of Hoylake Investments PLC, an investor group formed 
specifically to make the BAT bid. 
</P>

Sent Index Soaring 
</P>
<P>
The bid and the associated takeover fever Tuesday sent the Financial Times' 
100-share index to a post-1987 crash high, up 55.7 points, or more than 2.5%, 
to close at 2,250.9. 
</P>
<P>
Known in the British press as "the buccaneering billionaire," Goldsmith, 56, 
has made nearly as many headlines because of his life style as he has because 
of his roller-coaster business career. 
</P>
<P>
After an early up-and-down business career, he made millions in the food 
business here and was knighted before quitting England a decade ago in despair 
over its political and economic future. 
</P>
<P>
He exported his takeover talents to the United States, where he multiplied his 
fortune in raids on Diamond International Corp., St. Regis Paper, Crown 
Zellerbach and, finally, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. But his greatest coup 
was to pull most of his assets out of the stock market just before the Black 
Monday crash in October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He told a London news conference Tuesday that he had decided to return to 
Britain now because its economic prospects look "pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
He also rejected suggestions that his BAT bid was an example of 
asset-stripping, arguing that international conglomerates are a failure. He 
said BAT, which marked a watershed last year by generating more than 50% of its 
profits from non-tobacco interests for the first time, had made a mistake by 
diversifying. Goldsmith maintained that he only wants to "liberate" companies 
that have been "stifled" under the conglomerate structure. 
</P>
<P>
Hoylake's plan is to arrange bridge loans to buy BAT, then to immediately sell 
all the non-tobacco interests to pay off the debt as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith admitted that the plan entails risk but argued that "the ultimate 
risk is not taking a risk." 
</P>
<P>
BAT posted an after-tax profit equivalent to $1.55 billion on revenue of $28.8 
billion in its most recent fiscal year, which ended March 31. It is the 
third-largest publicly held British corporation, following British Petroleum 
and Shell Oil.

GARDEN GROVE TO BE ONE OF FIRST SITES FOR INACOMP-MITSUBISHI 'SUPERSTORE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an effort to tap the booming home-office market, Inacomp Computer Centers, 
one of the nation's leading computer retail chains, has joined forces with 
Mitsubishi of Japan to create a new group of computer "superstores," starting 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The first of the new outlets, which will be the size of small supermarkets, is 
scheduled to open in Garden Grove in September. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Inatome, chief executive of Inacomp, said the new stores were conceived as 
"total small-business resource centers" that would take advantage of the 
"explosive" growth in demand for personal computers and office products among 
home-based businesses and other small firms. 
</P>
<P>
"This segment is a very fast-growing portion of the PC industry, and in the 
distribution business there is a trend toward segmentation," Inatome said. "You 
used to go to a generic computer store, but now there's an orientation toward 
servicing particular segments." 
</P>
<P>
Inacomp will be the managing partner of the joint venture, dubbed Computer 
Supercenters International, and will retain a controlling interest, according 
to Inatome, who co-founded Inacomp with his father, Joseph Inatome. The elder 
Inatome will be chairman and chief executive of the new venture, which will 
invest about $6 million for the initial phase. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for the establishment of four centers in 1990-1991, and up to 20 
over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
The Computer Supercenters will feature a broad range of computer hardware and 
software as well as fax machines, copiers, and books and magazines. In 
addition, they will boast a family drop-in center, a theater for vendor 
demonstrations, and some small business services such as PC publishing. "They 
will have a trade-show like appeal," said Inatome. 
</P>
<P>
Computer stores, such as the existing Inacomp outlets, Businessland and 
ComputerLand, focus primarily on larger business customers, and the stores tend 
to be about 3,000 to 6,000 square feet. The Inacomp Supercenters will be 20,000 
to 25,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
John Russell, editor of the trade newspaper Computer Reseller News, called the 
company "a major endorsement of the home office market, and an example of how 
the larger chains are starting to diversify." Up to now, he said, there had 
been a smattering of computer superstores, such as Businessland subsidiary 
Computer Craft, that had done reasonably well. Now, he said, these retailers 
are ready to "start hitting their stride." 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi is interested in the venture "first and foremost" as an investment 
opportunity, according to a company spokesman, and also views it as a way to 
gain some retailing experience. In addition, Computer Supercenters could 
benefit from the Mitsubishi trading company's purchasing power around the 
world. The electronics products branch of the Japanese firm is not involved.

ALMANAC: COMPARING HOME PRICES; 
</P>
<P>
SWEET O.C. MEMORY: A HOUSE FOR $34,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Remember those ancient times when you could buy a house in Orange County for 
$34,000? Not so ancient, actually. How about 1974? 
</P>
<P>
Selected houses in the county were appraised that year as part of a survey by 
the Real Estate Research Council of Southern California, and the average price 
of the houses appraised was $34,000. 
</P>
<P>
The council conducts appraisals every six months -- on the same houses, 
whenever possible -- and its Orange County average for April of this year was 
$232,900. 
</P>
<P>
Prices have risen even faster in Los Angeles County. In 1974, the $40,600 
average in L.A. County was 18% higher than the Orange County average. By this 
year, the gap had widened to 34%. 
</P>
<P>
The comparison with San Diego County is more favorable. Houses appraised there 
had a higher average price than the Orange County average as recently as 1986, 
but now the Orange County houses have an edge of 12%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOME PRICE INDEX 
</P>
<P>
A measure of home-price appreciation is the Home Price Index compiled twice a 
year by the Real Estate Research Council of Southern California. The council 
sponsors appraisals of selected homes twice a year -- using the same homes 
whenever possible. The index uses 1975 as a base year with a number of 100. The 
most recent index figure for Orange County, 490, indicates that the average 
price of appraised homes has increased nearly fivefold since 1975.

CMS Enhancements Inc., a fast-growing Tustin computer company, has reached an 
agreement with two California banks to receive up to $25 million in loans. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement is with Newport Beach-based Bank of the West and Los 
Angeles-based California Federal Bank. The new line of credit represents an 
increase over the $17-million credit line the two banks provided to CMS during 
its last fiscal year, which ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any immediate needs for the money," said Frederick Judd, CMS's 
chief financial officer. "We are just continuing to plan for our future 
growth."

S.D. HOUSING COSTS STILL RISING BUT AT SLOWER PACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The average cost of San Diego housing is still heading upward but the rate of 
increase has leveled off from last year's frenzied pace, according to new 
market surveys released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The average sales price of an existing house in the San Diego metropolitan area 
was $217,228 in June, up 24% from the $175,416 average price in June, 1988, 
according to the San Diego Board of Realtors. The June average was also up 
nearly $10,000 from the $207,478 average in May. 
</P>
<P>
But the overall average was skewed somewhat by the disproportionate increase in 
prices and unit sales of higher-priced homes, Board of Realtors President Chuck 
Hoffman said Monday. An indication of how the high-priced dwellings are leading 
the way was that homes priced over $200,000 accounted for 38% of all resales in 
June, up from 24% in June, 1988, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Median Price Unchanged 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, prices of lower-priced, or so-called entry-level, houses in San 
Diego remained relatively flat in June. Noting that less than 20% of San Diego 
families can afford the median-priced home in the county, brokers said that 
first-time buyers seemed to have stretched their budgets to the breaking point 
to qualify for home loans. 
</P>
<P>
An indication of the flatness was that the median price of San Diego resales 
was $177,000, unchanged from the median price in April and May. 
</P>
<P>
"We finally have priced property to the point where it will not sell 
instantaneously," said Ray Baker, owner-broker of Century 21-Golden Circle, a 
brokerage that specializes in housing in the Mira Mesa area. "We're coming back 
to reality. We are seeing houses languishing, not selling. We are now getting 
price reductions." 
</P>
<P>
A survey of new housing sold at county subdivisions also found a slowdown of 
the near-panic buying and price escalation that characterized last year's 
market. According to a survey by Meyers Group, the average price of new 
single-family houses sold countywide during the three months ended in June was 
$230,000, up 40% from the $163,990 average a year ago but just $3,000 more than 
the average price during the first quarter of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
According to Meyers Group Vice President Peter Reeb, average prices of new 
houses in some areas of the county, notably Carlsbad and Oceanside, decreased 
from this year's first quarter. However, some areas, including Escondido and 
San Diego, showed price increases. 
</P>
<P>
Another sign of market cooling is that unit sales were down both in new and 
resold houses. Reeb said total units sold at subdivisions over the quarter were 
2,153, down from 3,190 units sold over the same three-month period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego Board of Realtors, whose members handle transactions in San 
Diego, Chula Vista, El Cajon and La Mesa, reported sales transactions totaling 
1,328 houses and condominiums in June, down 12% from the 1,494 units sold in 
June, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Russell Valone, president of Market Profiles of San Diego, a firm that tracks 
subdivision sales, said the slowdown in activity shows that the San Diego 
housing market is "normalizing" after last year's extraordinary pressures. 
Those pressures included the threat of slow-growth ballot measures that were 
defeated at the polls last November. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Johnson, a principal at Fieldstone Co., a San Diego home builder with 
four projects in the county, said his staff has noticed a slowdown in buyer 
traffic and reduced buyer enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is that there has been a substantial run-up in prices and that the 
market is having a hard time digesting that," Johnson said. "It's not that 
houses aren't selling. It's just that the market, from a builder's point of 
view, has gone from great to good."

JIM MURRAY: RYAN HAD STUFF THEY DIDN'T SEE

<P>
There are lots of things I would rather do than go to bat against Nolan Ryan in 
the deepening shadows of a California twilight. 
</P>
<P>
Let's see, in no particular order, they would be, 
</P>
<P>
1.) Go to the dentist for a root canal. 
</P>
<P>
2.) Spend Saturday night in Gestapo headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
3.) Be on the deck of the Titanic. 
</P>
<P>
4.) Ride shotgun for Custer. 
</P>
<P>
5.) Get caught on the ropes by Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
6.) Be in the cockpit of an Indy car with the brakes gone and the tires 
shredding. 
</P>
<P>
7.) Ride a shark, milk a rattlesnake. 
</P>
<P>
8.) Be on the ocean floor in a submarine with depth charges going off over your 
head, or 
</P>
<P>
9.) Win a trip to Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
English translation: there are better ways to make a living. 
</P>
<P>
There are All-Stars and there are All-Stars. Long after the final score has 
been forgotten, the 1989 All-Star game will be remembered for a massive home 
run hit by Bo Jackson on the second pitch in the bottom of the first inning -- 
and a 35-pitch performance by Lynn Nolan Ryan in which only one pitch was hit 
out of the infield and most weren't hit at all. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan Ryan is the oldest man to win an All-Star game. He is the second-oldest 
to pitch in it. 
</P>
<P>
At the age of 42 1/2, you're supposed to throw out the ceremonial first pitch 
in All-Star games, not ones about 97 miles an hour in on the fists of a guy 
two-thirds your age. That's what Nolan Ryan's first pitch did to Ryne Sandberg, 
who meekly popped it up halfway down the third base line. 
</P>
<P>
There were 56 of the best baseball players on the planet in Tuesday's All-Star 
game. Only one is a certified legend. Some day, a half-dozen, or even a dozen 
of the participants may qualify for the Hall of Fame. Nolan's already got one 
foot in it. Some day, old-timers may remember and embellish the home run Bo 
Jackson hit and rank it with the one another Jackson (Reggie) hit in Detroit in 
an All-Star game. But Bo Jackson has to hit 300 more before he gets his place 
in baseball history Nolan Ryan has. 
</P>
<P>
Giving Nolan Ryan twilight to pitch in is like giving Dempsey the first punch. 
It's all he will need. The pitching line on him was not earth-shattering. Nolan 
did not strike out five in a row a la Hubbell in 1934. He just mowed down the 
lineup with a three-strikeout, one-hit performance. The "hit" went off his 
glove and never even got as far as the outfield grass, but Tony Gwynn was able 
to beat it out. Nolan promptly fanned Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell, a slugger 
who is chasing Babe Ruth's and Roger Maris' single-season home run records. 
Then, Ryan got Eric Davis to get the bat on the ball late and fly out 
harmlessly to right. It was the only ball to leave the infield. 
</P>
<P>
Nolan Ryan is tough to hit with the sun shining, the sky cloudless and the air 
quality good and the ball spotless. In the crepuscular light of 7 o'clock on a 
summer night, the pitches should carry a warning by the Surgeon General. 
</P>
<P>
Playing a game at that hour is the next best thing to playing it underwater. 
It's a form of zombie baseball. The light is adequate from the start of a game, 
5:30 to about 6:45. Then, when the artificial lights struggle to take over, 
batters are pretty much at the mercy of a fastball, to say nothing of a Ryan 
fastball. 
</P>
<P>
It is a measure of how far Nolan Ryan has come as a pitcher that he turned back 
some of the best hitters in the game with his breaking pitches as much as 
fastballs Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Giving Nolan Ryan a changeup should be a violation of anti-trust. It's like 
giving a leopard another set of claws or letting Tyson bite. 
</P>
<P>
They used 14 pitchers in the All-Star game, one of them a little better than 
half Ryan's age. But Nolan Ryan, leaning on his knees between pitches and 
hanging his head as if he were bone-tired and not at all sure if he could hoist 
the next pitch up to the plate -- only to straighten up and loose something 
that glowed on its way to the plate is a sight to carry away from All-Star game 
No. 60. 
</P>
<P>
It could ultimately belong to Bo Jackson, as exciting with a bat as Nolan Ryan 
is with the ball. On the basis of what this Jackson showed on the field -- a 
home run, single, stolen base, running catch and strikeout -- you would have to 
conclude giving him a football is like giving Rembrandt a camera. He might be 
good at that, too, but it's a historical oversight. When you can hit the 
curveball that well, you shouldn't be in any sport where you have to wear 
shoulder pads and risk nosebleeds and permanent headaches. Nobody blind-sides 
you in a home run trot. 
</P>
<P>
There is no question Nolan Ryan is in the right profession. He is as good as 
any immortal who ever loosed a 100-mile-an-hour fastball at some poor guy with 
only a bat to do anything about it. If he could always have pitched in 
twilight, they would have had to ban him like any other assault weapon.

MIKE DOWNEY: AFTER JETS MADE A FLYBY, HE LAUNCHED HIS ROCKET

Four Air Force fighter jets flew over Anaheim Stadium, just before the All-Star 
game's first pitch, and Bo Jackson craned his neck in the American League's 
dugout, sky-eyed. The planes were there and gone in a fraction of a second, 
which also was true, a short while later, about the baseball that Action 
Jackson sent flying Tuesday, a shot that broke the mound barrier. 
</P>
<P>
An announcement was made that the ball traveled "approximately 448 feet." 
Funny, we could have sworn it went at least 449. Anyway, it plopped down 
someplace well beyond the center-field fence and someplace this side of the 
Matterhorn ride at Disneyland, with UFO sightings reported at various Orange 
County military installations. Bo Jackson punched a hole in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
All of the pitchers in the National League's bullpen charged to the front of 
the fence to get a better look, as Jackson's first-inning, first-time-up home 
run in the twilight's last gleaming lit up their unlucky teammate, Rick 
Reuschel. 
</P>
<P>
Allegiances aside, Jay Howell had to admit, "We were cheering when he hit it," 
because on those rare occasions when you see something like this pass overhead, 
it is usually named after Halley. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can say is, if I was (still) in the American League, I'd wish he'd play 
football all the time," Howell said. "We were sitting around slapping hands and 
saying to each other: 'Geez! Where are you gonna pitch him?' " 
</P>
<P>
Other reactions were not unsimilar. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel, the server of gopher: "I'd heard about his power and strength. I saw 
it firsthand tonight." 
</P>
<P>
Eric Davis, the center fielder over whom the homer flew: "It was what you call 
a towering home run. I mean, towering. I went back a couple of steps, and then 
just didn't bother." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Gwynn, the right fielder who watched Davis not bother: "I became a 
believer from seeing him in batting practice yesterday. He hit a screaming mimi 
about 10 feet off the ground, and it didn't waver a bit till it hit the fence. 
If it had been a softer fence, it would have torn right through it. Now I've 
seen this one, and I believe even more." 
</P>
<P>
Everybody was impressed by Bo but Bo. 
</P>
<P>
He said: 
</P>
<P>
"I got a piece of it." 
</P>
<P>
A piece of it. Yeah, right. Some piece. When the kids came traversing across 
the tarpaulin in center field, the one used by hitters as a batting backdrop, 
to retrieve the ball, chances are pretty good that one of them found a 
horsehide cover while another one found a small ball of twine. If ever a guy 
knocked the cover off a ball, it must have been this guy, this ball. And to 
think it was Jackson's first swing L in an All-Star game. He did everything but 
point to center field before hitting it. 
</P>
<P>
The most valuable player of the 60th All-Star roundup, Jackson donated a 
dinger, a run-scoring grounder, a single and a stolen base. Only one other man 
-- Willie Mays, no less -- ever had a homer and a steal in the same midsummer 
classic. Only four other men, Mays included, ever homered in the All-Star game 
as leadoff batter for his team. Quite a guy, this Vincent Jackson. Maybe he can 
play hockey. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo's in a league by himself," AL teammate Devon White said. 
</P>
<P>
There were those who told him to stick to football who now must wonder why he 
bothers playing anything else but baseball. Even today, the impression he makes 
is that of a kid who is still feeling his way around a diamond, a kid who is 
going to settle for 40 homers and 40 stolen bases until he gets the hang of 
this game. The first words out of pitcher Greg Swindell's mouth after Tuesday's 
game were: "When he learns how to play this game, he's going to be really 
scary." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson is not easily distracted. He refuses to talk about football during 
baseball season, refuses to talk about baseball during football season. His 
favorite shoe company recently presented him, as a gift, a lovely set of woods 
and irons, but Bo has yet to unwrap them, partly because he says there hasn't 
been time to play any golf, and partly because he knows so little about the 
game that he refers to the equipment as "a pair of clubs." 
</P>
<P>
One thing Bo does like, though, is airplanes. Especially fast airplanes. Like 
the ones that flew by in perfect formation. Calling himself "a big military 
plane fan," Jackson actually said that he enjoyed watching those planes zoom by 
more than he enjoyed hitting that home run. Nothing about it impressed him, not 
even the distance. "It doesn't matter if you strike out or hit a ball that goes 
30 or 40 feet or if you hit one 400 feet. The name of the game is being out 
there and hustling. The fun of it is in the playing." 
</P>
<P>
And the National Leaguers did have some fun, even during a 5-3 beating. Had 
some fun with Bo, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
"The thought never entered my mind prior to the game that I might be most 
valuable player, but after I hit that first ball, I came back to the dugout and 
everybody said, 'Bo, you got this thing wrapped up.' Then Wade Boggs went deep, 
the very next batter, and when he got back to the dugout, everybody said, 
'Wade, you got this thing wrapped up.' " 
</P>
<P>
They gave Jackson the award, and also hoped to give him the baseball he hit. 
</P>
<P>
But the search plane they sent out couldn't find it.

They told Bo Jackson to lead off Tuesday, so Bo led off, if that's what you 
want to call it. 
</P>
<P>
The first batter for the American League All-Stars, Bo looked at one pitch from 
National League starter Rick Reuschel. 
</P>
<P>
He swung at the next. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the baseball prepared for re-entry, its shadow could be seen some 
448 feet from home plate. The ball didn't just clear the center-field fence. It 
landed halfway up the green tarpaulin leading to Tunnel 70, which serves as a 
viewing backdrop for hitters at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Once again, Bo had gone where few ever thought to tread. His monstrous blast, 
the first leadoff home run in an All-Star game since 1977, was immediately 
followed by a home run from Wade Boggs and, just that fast, the American 
Leaguers had tied the game and were on their way to a 5-3 victory in the 60th 
All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
The idea behind batting Jackson leadoff, AL Manager Tony La Russa had tried to 
explain, was to make Reuschel as "uncomfortable" as quickly as possible. 
Uncomfortable? Well, it does strain one's neck to snap it around as quickly as 
Reuschel had to in order to catch a glimpse of Air Bo. 
</P>
<P>
The home run was estimated at 448 feet, but that's only because Jackson hit it 
nearly as high as he did far. Official records aren't kept, but that may have 
been the longest pop fly in Anaheim Stadium history. 
</P>
<P>
"When the ball hit the bat," NL Manager Tom Lasorda said, "it sounded like he 
hit a golf ball." 
</P>
<P>
It took off like one, too, drawing such a gasp from the crowd of 64,036 that 
Texas' Nolan Ryan stopped warming up in the AL bullpen and hunted down a TV 
monitor. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know what happened," Ryan said. "I had to catch it on the replay." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's was the first leadoff home run in All-Star competition since 
Cincinnati's Joe Morgan did it 12 years ago. It also, apparently, was 
inspirational because Boggs, baseball's pre-eminent spray hitter, followed him 
six pitches later with a rare home run, this one traveling a mortal-sized 
distance of 398 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The back-to-back home runs were the first since Dodgers Steve Garvey and Jimmy 
Wynn turned the feat in the 1975 All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
Firsts, firsts. Before the night was through, Bo would lead the world in 
firsts. 
</P>
<P>
With his next at-bat, coming in the second inning, Jackson hit a routine 
double-play grounder to shortstop but outran pivot man Ryne Sandberg's throw to 
first. In so doing, Jackson prolonged the inning and earned a run batted in, 
with Ruben Sierra scoring from third on the play. 
</P>
<P>
Then Jackson stole second base, becoming the first All-Star to hit a home run 
and steal a base in the same game since a fellow named Willie Mays did it in 
1962. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson added a single and a strikeout in his last two at-bats before turning 
left field over to Boston's Mike Greenwell in the top of the seventh. Not a bad 
six innings' work: four at-bats, two hits, two runs batted in, a stolen base 
and a home run that had the best players in the sport raving and running out of 
superlatives. 
</P>
<P>
As a runaway choice, Jackson was voted the game's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a believer," NL outfielder Tony Gwynn announced. "Bo can do anything. It's 
scary, it's scary . . . 
</P>
<P>
"He changes the way people think about the game. He's redefining the game as we 
speak." 
</P>
<P>
Added NL third baseman Bobby Bonilla of Pittsburgh: "After seeing him tonight, 
now I know what I got to do. I've got to go home this winter and put a Nautilus 
machine in my back yard." 
</P>
<P>
It's a shame Bo's spreading himself too thin with that National Football League 
stuff, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
And remember, Jackson was making his All-Star debut. His home run came in his 
first All-Star at-bat, an achievement matched by only eight other players. 
</P>
<P>
"I had butterflies when I was in the on-deck circle," Jackson said. "But when I 
got to the plate, I put tunnel vision on the pitcher and decided to just do 
what comes natural." 
</P>
<P>
We saw, we saw. 
</P>
<P>
The thing is, Jackson didn't even think he got a good swing at the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a strike," he said. "The ball I hit, I swung like I swing a golf 
club. Luckily, I got a piece of it." 
</P>
<P>
A piece of it? Not all of it? 
</P>
<P>
Jackson shrugged. "I don't know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In 15 minutes, the 1989 All-Star game produced more runs -- four -- than 15 
innings could during the first All-Star game held at Anaheim Stadium, in 1967. 
Twenty-two years ago, it took a 15th-inning home run by Tony Perez to give the 
National League a 2-1 victory at the Big A. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the game was tied, 2-2, after one inning. The NL scored its first 
two against a shaky Dave Stewart, who walked two and yielded three hits, 
including run-scoring singles by Kevin Mitchell and Howard Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel gave the lead back after pitching to two batters. And when Jackson's 
second-inning grounder scored Sierra, the AL was ahead to stay, soon to record 
its second consecutive victory and its third All-Star win in the past four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
By the second inning, both starting pitchers were gone. Atlanta's John Smoltz 
replaced Reuschel and Stewart gave way to Ryan, the fabled former Angel 
fastballer, much to the approval of the Anaheim crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan, at 42 the second oldest All-Star pitcher ever, completed two scoreless 
innings, striking out three -- including San Francisco sluggers Will Clark and 
Mitchell in succession -- while allowing only a scratch single to Gwynn. 
</P>
<P>
But these strikeouts didn't come via the vaunted Express. Older and wiser, Ryan 
resorted to curveballs and changeups to ease his way through his stint. 
</P>
<P>
"The key, for me, was a good changeup," said Ryan, who added the words most of 
us figured we would never live to hear: 
</P>
<P>
"My fastball was just enough to make my changeup effective." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, things have changed a bit since Ryan last hung a shingle at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan wound up as the winning pitcher and the most effective of a record eight 
pitchers employed by La Russa. Ryan was followed, in order, by Kansas City's 
Mark Gubicza, Oakland's Mike Moore, Cleveland's Greg Swindell, Texas' Jeff 
Russell, Milwaukee's Dan Plesac and Cleveland's Doug Jones, who was credited 
with the save. 
</P>
<P>
Smoltz was the loser. 
</P>
<P>
The American League scored its final two runs against Rick Sutcliffe in the 
third inning. Sutcliffe, a last-minute replacement for injured Mike Scott, 
surrendered four singles in the inning, including run-scoring hits to Sierra 
and Harold Baines. 
</P>
<P>
Baines and Pedro Guerrero of the St. Louis Cardinals debuted as the first 
designated hitters to be used in an All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
The National League managed only one more run against La Russa's fleet of 
relievers. That came in the eighth inning, after Russell walked Glenn Davis and 
allowed another single to Mitchell. Von Hayes drove home Davis with a single to 
left against Plesac. 
</P>
<P>
On came Jones to close matters out. Jones ended the eighth inning by retiring 
Tim Wallach on a line drive to left and closed out the ninth by starting a 
game-ending double play, beginning with Tony Pena's tapper back to mound. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the Angels' Chuck Finley nor the Dodgers' Orel Hershiser appeared in 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
La Russa was asked, was this what he had in mind when he had the temerity to 
bat Jackson, the American League's home run leader, leadoff? 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately for me, that's exactly was I saw last week (from Jackson)," said 
La Russa, who now returns to his customary duties as Oakland A's manager. "I 
saw home runs, line drives, stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured it'd be exciting." 
</P>
<P>
And Bo's opinion of the leadoff profession? Is he ready for a new lot in life 
with the Kansas City Royals? 
</P>
<P>
"Let's not start nothing here," he said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
For one All-Star evening, Bo had started enough.

REUSCHEL, AT 40, HAS CONTROL OF HIS CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANNY ROBBINS, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seven years ago, Rick Reuschel heard the three words a pitcher may dread more 
than any others: torn rotator cuff. Then 33, Reuschel appeared to have a 
brighter future as a dairy farmer than as a major-league pitcher. Two prominent 
physicians told him his chances of pitching effectively again were almost nil. 
Two teams, the New York Yankees and Chicago Cubs, gave up on him. 
</P>
<P>
But Reuschel, winner of 133 games in nine major-league seasons before the 
injury, refused to believe he was washed up. Instead of hauling hay, he kept 
throwing the ball -- although sometimes the only people around to catch him 
were his agents -- and now his perseverance is paying off in a manner that 
transcends the usual comeback standards. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel isn't just a useful major-league pitcher again, he is one of the 
game's best. The right-hander is 36-17 since his trade from Pittsburgh to the 
San Francisco Giants in August, 1987, and seemingly getting better with each 
advancing year. "He's amazing," Giants Manager Roger Craig said. "He's pitching 
better now than he did last year; and he won 19 games last year." 
</P>
<P>
In one stretch in May and June, Reuschel won nine straight, including a 2-1 
victory over the Montreal Expos May 12 that was the 200th win of his career. At 
the All-Star break (which was no break for Reuschel because he was the starting 
pitcher for the National League), he is 12-3 with a 2.12 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
How does a paunchy, 40-year-old pitcher with a rebuilt shoulder cut up National 
League hitters night after night? 
</P>
<P>
"He preys on the hitter's greed," Giants catcher Terry Kennedy said. "When a 
hitter's got a 2-0, 2-1, 3-0, 3-1 count, supposedly he's in charge. But when 
Rick's pitching, Rick's in charge. He'll take a little bit more off, put a 
little bit more on. Throw the ball just out of the strike zone. Throw a pitch 
that starts in the strike zone and goes out. It's never the same pitch twice. 
The hitter hits a ground ball or pops up. It's hard to get the fat part of the 
bat on the ball with him." 
</P>
<P>
Said Craig: "I've seen pitchers with control as good as his, but I've never 
seen anybody who can throw the same hitter three fastballs in the same spot at 
different speeds like he does. He changes speeds better than anybody I've ever 
seen." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the quintessential Reuschel game occurred June 21 when he beat the 
Houston Astros for his 12th win of the season. He gave up four hits in 7 2/3 
innings and threw only 66 pitches, 52 for strikes. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel was a 20-game winner for the Cubs in 1977, but five years later, after 
his trade to the Yankees in the middle of the '81 season, his career unraveled 
because of the torn rotator cuff. He spent the 1982 season on the disabled list 
before undergoing surgery Sept. 8, 1982. When he came off the DL June 9, 1983, 
the Yankees released him. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Reuschel believes he was branded as damaged goods before he had a 
chance to recover from his injury. 
</P>
<P>
"One reason a lot of guys don't come back (from rotator cuff problems) -- maybe 
not so much right now, but when I was going through it -- is there's a stigma 
attached," he said. "Any kind of rotator cuff injury, especially to pitchers, 
they don't expect you to come back, and therefore they don't really encourage 
you a whole lot to come back." 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel said the Yankees' team doctor at the time, John Bonamo, and noted Los 
Angeles orthopedist Dr. Frank Jobe both told him there was little chance he 
would pitch again. When Reuschel consulted an orthopedic surgeon in his 
hometown of Arlington Heights, Ill., he got a more upbeat prognosis. According 
to Reuschel, Dr. Ralph Lidge "felt like my problem could be addressed without a 
whole lot of problem, and that if I was willing to work at my rehab, there was 
no reason why I couldn't pitch again." 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by Lidge's diagnosis, Reuschel signed with Quad Cities of the Midwest 
League, then the Cubs' Class-A farm club, two weeks after his release by the 
Yankees. Two months later, he had worked his way back to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The struggle didn't end there, however. Reuschel spent the '84 season with the 
Cubs but didn't show enough (a 5-5 record with a 5.17 ERA between stints on the 
DL) to warrant a spot on the team's postseason roster. And when he became a 
free agent in November, he was not chosen in the re-entry draft. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Pirates offered to give him a shot in spring training, and, 
wearing No. 70, befitting his afterthought status, he threw well enough to earn 
a further look at Hawaii, then the Pirates' Triple-A affiliate. Called up May 
21, 1985, he went 14-8 with a 2.27 ERA for the Pirates, an effort that made him 
The Sporting News' Comeback Player of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
Said Lidge: "I think his pain tolerance is extremely high ... And he has a lot 
of smarts. You're not impressed with that when you first talk to him, but in 
getting to know him, I could see he has the right mix -- like they say, the 
right stuff." 
</P>
<P>
What's next? The Cy Young Award? The Rick Reuschel Workout? 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel doesn't make a whole lot of his comeback. "It was just a lot of hard 
work," he said. "I had nothing else to do anyway, so I don't think it was all 
that big a deal."

Although he will be replaced by former San Francisco 49er coach Bill Walsh as 
NBC's No. 1 football analyst next season, Merlin Olsen will remain with the 
network. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Ebersol, NBC Sports president, said Tuesday that Olsen will work a full 
schedule of games with Charlie Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Ebersol and Terry O'Neil, NBC Sports executive producer, met with Olsen Monday 
night after it was revealed that Walsh would be Dick Enberg's new partner. 
</P>
<P>
"Merlin couldn't have been classier," Ebersol said. "Using some baseball 
terminology, he said, 'You don't have to bat cleanup to be a member of a team.'

EX-NFL PLAYER'S WARNING ABOUT HAZARDS OF DRUG USE COMES STRAIGHT FROM THE HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARCIA DUNN, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WEXFORD, Pa. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every day, while he waits and hopes a suitable heart has been found, Steve 
Courson scribbles furiously into spiral notebooks. 
</P>
<P>
He is concluding more than three years of work on an autobiography that 
includes a long chapter on the hazards of anabolic steroids. 
</P>
<P>
He also is writing letters and editorials on what he calls the sports world's 
"chemical dilemma." 
</P>
<P>
"This health demise of mine is not something that I'm really thrilled about 
having to deal with," he said. "But indirectly, it gives me a platform to get 
my message across to young people." 
</P>
<P>
Courson, 33, doesn't worry when a heart big enough to fit his 6-foot-1 1/2, 
255-pound body will be found. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry about not getting my message out and not having the time and health to 
do it. That's what I worry about." 
</P>
<P>
So Courson writes at his apartment in Wexford, a 20-minute drive from 
Pittsburgh's Allegheny General Hospital, where his operation will be performed. 
</P>
<P>
Courson is searching for a publisher for his book, "War in the Trenches: The 
Chemical Battlefield." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he's revising and updating the manuscript and scheduling 
speeches at schools. 
</P>
<P>
"No one's talking about steroids and pain-killers and what it takes to play. 
I'd just like to prevent this from happening to someone else." 
</P>
<P>
Despite all that's happened, Courson doesn't regret choosing football as a 
career. 
</P>
<P>
"I played two Super Bowls. I had some great moments in my athletic career," he 
said. "But that doesn't mean I still don't politically disagree with certain 
things that go on. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not been mesmerized by the NFL's propaganda machine. At one time I was. 
But after you experience it and you were there, you understand what it's all 
about. You're an item. You're essentially a disposable hero." 
</P>
<P>
He also doesn't regret taking steroids, at least "not wholeheartedly." 
</P>
<P>
"They helped my career," he said. "As competitive as the atmosphere of the NFL 
is, every edge you can get helps." 
</P>
<P>
Once his book is published and his transplant is behind him, Courson plans to 
marry, return to college to finish his bachelor's degree. He then would like to 
earn a doctorate in history. 
</P>
<P>
"Athletics, you know, I enjoy them," he said. "But from what I've been through, 
I'll use my brain to get through life instead of my body from now on."

PRICE OF GLORY? HE AWAITS TRANSPLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
He was one of professional football's mightiest men, a 295-pounder who could 
bench press twice his weight. Now, Steve Courson is thrilled to lift 15-pound 
weights. 
</P>
<P>
The former offensive lineman, now 33, suffers from cardiomyopathy, a mysterious 
disease that turns heart muscle into flab and eventually kills its victims 
unless they undergo a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Though his doctors can't blame Courson's condition on his long, heavy use of 
anabolic steroids, they can't rule it out. Neither can he. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many ironies about my situation," he said. "That's why I can't 
discard them as being an accident. Why is all this happening to me? I've had 
two strikes. Strike three, you're out." 
</P>
<P>
Courson, formerly of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, is 
believed to be the first professional athlete to be put on the waiting list for 
a heart transplant after years of taking anabolic steroids. 
</P>
<P>
Experts fear more may follow. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be surprised. I think it's going to happen," said transplant 
pioneer Dr. Thomas E. Starzl of the University of Pittsburgh. "It might be 
liver disease that comes out of those things, too." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dr. Lyle Micheli, president of the American College of Sports Medicine: 
"The potential health hazard and the impact on the national health care system 
. . . it's very frightening." 
</P>
<P>
Anabolic steroids are derivatives of the male sex hormone testosterone. They 
stimulate development of bone, muscle and skin. 
</P>
<P>
Courson first took anabolic steroids in 1974 before his sophomore year at the 
University of South Carolina. In four weeks, he went from 230 pounds to a solid 
260. He continued the off-season habit after being drafted by the Steelers in 
1977 and playing on two Super Bowl teams. 
</P>
<P>
Not long after being traded to the Buccaneers in 1984, Courson boasted a 
60-inch chest and 22-inch biceps and was pressing up to 605 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who's trained with weights or trained that seriously at world-class 
level realizes those types of gains don't occur by eating Wheaties," Courson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Courson was spending $1,500 a year for steroids, "not that big a 
tradeoff when you're making $300,000 a year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In March of 1985, in the midst of an 1,800 milligram-a-week regimen, his 
highest ever, doctors told him he had an irregular heartbeat. The problem 
cleared in two weeks with medication, and Courson quit steroids for the next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the 1985 season, Courson lost his starting job. He took his last 
dose of anabolic steroids before the Buccaneers' training camp in 1986 in hopes 
of earning a starting spot. "I wanted to maintain a competitive edge and I 
realize it had to do with my age, too, the wear and tear on the body." 
</P>
<P>
Courson was waived at the start of the season, got no other offers, and 
retired. He lived in Wyoming and Florida, then returned to the Pittsburgh area 
in early 1988 to finish his autobiography and train as a professional wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 23, 1988, Courson went to Allegheny General Hospital for what he 
thought was an ulcer. It turned out to be cardiomyopathy. 
</P>
<P>
For years, doctors have warned of the immediate side effects of steroids: acne, 
sexual dysfunction, rashes and unusually aggressive behavior. Less is known 
about long-term effects, although animal tests suggest the drugs accelerate 
cardiovascular disease. 
</P>
<P>
"Anybody who's used steroids and has any malady, it's immediately assumed 
steroids caused it," said Dr. Charles Yesalis of Pennsylvania State University. 
"We haven't even done those studies yet." 
</P>
<P>
Said Dr. Judith Orie, Courson's cardiologist: "We don't know frankly what is 
the bottom line. But we do know anabolic steroids cause high blood pressure in 
patients. High blood pressure after a point in time causes the heart to fail." 
</P>
<P>
Also, "steroids can alter the immune system. We don't know whether that has 
played a role and allowed a virus to affect his heart or not," Orie said. 
</P>
<P>
Complicating matters is the fact that doctors don't always know what causes 
cardiomyopathy. 
</P>
<P>
"There are many people who have cardiomyopathy and had nothing to do with 
steroids," said Dr. Barry Maron of the National Institutes of Health. "That's 
the problem there is in establishing a connection in this one person. It's a 
very iffy kind of thing (although) I'm not saying it's impossible." 
</P>
<P>
About 40% of all heart transplants are performed on cardiomyopathy patients, 
said Dr. Michael Kaye of UC San Diego. Kaye keeps the international registry of 
heart, heart-lung and lung transplants, of which there had been 11,181 by late 
June. The vast majority -- 10,154 -- were heart transplants. 
</P>
<P>
There were 1,223 Americans awaiting heart transplants as of June 26, according 
tothe United Network for Organ Sharing. 
</P>
<P>
"The transplant community is concerned (about steroids) because of the 
tremendous need for organs and lack of donors," Kaye said. 
</P>
<P>
Courson, who has been on the list since March 31, could wait a long time 
because of his body size. Doctors give him two years without a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
Experimental heart medication has enabled Courson to go from an all-time adult 
low of 225 pounds late last year to 255 pounds. It has also allowed him to stay 
in shape by walking treadmills and lifting light weights at Allegheny General's 
cardiac rehabilitation laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the scarcity of organs, some wonder whether former steroid users 
should get the same priority as individuals who never took illicit drugs. 
Transplant doctors, however, say they merely take into account patients' 
current life styles and ability to maintain healthy habits. 
</P>
<P>
Cigarette smokers and alcoholics, for instance, usually are told they must stop 
before they can be considered for a transplant. That's no guarantee, however, 
that they will stop for good. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors say they extract a promise and hope for the best. 
</P>
<P>
"We really need that commitment," Starzl said. "But just because someone drank 
in the past, just because Steve Courson once took steroids so he could compete, 
I don't believe should be determining factors. I think he's been punished 
plenty." 
</P>
<P>
Courson feels no shame or guilt. "Everyone's got their faults. But when you 
were doing something that you got paid for and was glorified, are you totally 
to be blamed?" 
</P>

NEWSWIRE: RAIDS UNCOVER ALLEGED GAMBLING IN PREP SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An alleged gambling operation that might have involved game-fixing at the high 
school level was uncovered in raids that confiscated more than $500,000 in 
Florence, Ala., the FBI said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Florence police chief Rick Thompson was quoted in the Florence Times Daily and 
The Birmingham News as saying coaches may have been involved in the alleged 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
"Allegations brought forth during this investigation show that high school 
coaches and officials are manipulating the outcome of high school sporting 
events to cover the point spread given by odds makers," Thompson told the Times 
Daily. "In turn, these so-called coaches and officials have been tampering with 
the lives and future careers of our high school athletes."

<P>
AL PITCHERS TEACH A LESSON BY MAKING FAST WORK OF NL 
</P>

<P>
They've all heard the rap about the quality of pitching in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
You know, the league is full of pitchers who wouldn't challenge a hitter with a 
fastball. 
</P>
<P>
It's a reputation the 10 American League All-Star pitchers -- from Nolan Ryan, 
42, to Greg Swindell, 23 -- were determined to change, if for only one night. 
</P>
<P>
"I just heard something this morning about how the National League hitters 
always dominate this game," said Cleveland's Doug Jones, who gave up one hit in 
1 1/3 innings to earn a save in the AL's 5-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got guys who are throwing just as hard as they do. I think the American 
League is basically a fastball league now. The only difference between the 
leagues is the designated hitter." 
</P>
<P>
There weren't a whole lot of National League players belittling AL pitching at 
Anaheim. The National League's best had nine hits -- all singles -- and three 
of those came in the first inning when they roughed up Oakland's Dave Stewart 
for two runs. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the AL's don't-let-'em-hit parade: Texas' Ryan, Kansas City's Mark 
Gubicza, Oakland's Mike Moore and Cleveland's Swindell. Those four held the NL 
to three hits over the next 5 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
"The way Swindell and Gubicza were cranking it up there might change some of 
those opinions just a tad," said Angel Manager Doug Rader, who was the AL's 
third base coach. "If you want a benchmark, how about this? When Roger Clemens 
doesn't even make the club, I think this league's pitching is in pretty good 
shape." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't look so great in the first inning when Stewart gave up three singles, 
two walks and a stolen base. The National League scored twice, but it could 
have been considerably worse. St. Louis shortstop Ozzie Smith was caught 
stealing, and teammate Pedro Guerrero lined to left to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
"I struggled with my forkball and that's my bread-and-butter pitch," said 
Stewart, who was passed over for the last two All-Star squads despite 
impressive statistics. "I've given up two runs in the first inning lots of 
times and come back to shut a team out the rest of the way. Unfortunately, you 
don't get that chance in a game like this and you can't be selfish about it. " 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the American Leaguers who pitched -- a record-tying eight -- 
made the most of their opportunities, though. 
</P>
<P>
Ryan became the oldest pitcher to win an All-Star game, taking that honor from 
Early Wynn, who was 38 when he won in 1958. Ryan struck out three and yielded 
only an infield single to San Diego's Tony Gwynn in two innings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this is the highlight of my All-Star career," Ryan said. "It was 
special because it was in Anaheim Stadium. This place brings back a lot of 
great recollections for me. And it's been a nice trip for myself and my family. 
</P>
<P>
"The key to my two innings was a good changeup and a pretty good curve. I think 
they were looking for my fastball, but I got ahead of them and didn't have to 
give them many good pitches to hit. I think most of our pitchers did what we 
expected. Their pitching was indicative of the seasons they're having so far." 
</P>
<P>
Swindell wasn't sure what to expect. He admitted to being so excited, he almost 
forgot where he was. But he managed to match Ryan, striking out three and 
giving up two hits in a 1 2/3-inning stint. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't care if I gave up 10 runs, I just wanted to have fun here," 
Swindell said. "but Tony (La Russa, the AL manager) told us in a meeting 
yesterday that we were going to do what it takes to win this thing. 
</P>
<P>
"I was really pumped up. The adrenaline was flowing when I went in." 
</P>
<P>
This was not exactly a dream spot for a young pitcher making his first All-Star 
appearance. He threw his warmups and then had to enter the game against 
Houston's Glenn Davis (16 homers and 47 RBIs this season), San Francisco's 
Kevin Mitchell (31 and 81) and Cincinnati's Eric Davis (16, 52). 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't really think about who I'd be facing until I got out there, but 
that's why they call it an All-Star game," Swindell said. "I did what we all 
did pretty well tonight and that's keep the ball down. We got a lot of ground 
balls and some line drives, but we kept the ball in the park. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to give Tony some of the credit. He put together a pretty good 
staff."

THOSE SHADOWS PROVED TO BE NO HELP TO NL PITCHERS

Here's the pitching lineup National League Manager Tom Lasorda tossed -- 
underhand, it turns out -- to the American Leaguers during the first three 
innings of Tuesday night's All-Stargame: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rick Reuschel, San Francisco Giants. Lasorda didn't exactly specify how 
many innings Reuschel would remain on the mound, but the conventional wisdom 
had him lasting awhile. "I knew it was going to be one or two (innings), but I 
didn't know which," Reuschel said. 
</P>
<P>
Now he knows; it was one. 
</P>
<P>
AL leadoff man Bo Jackson hit a ball that sailed far beyond the Anaheim Stadium 
center-field fence and into the dusk, followed soon by a more modest homer by 
Wade Boggs. Not long after that, Reuschel was seated permanently on the NL 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
 -- John Smoltz, Atlanta Braves. All you need to know about Smoltz's stay is 
that he said this afterward: "Thank God I don't pitch in this ballpark." 
</P>
<P>
Smoltz's inning was highlighted by more Bo antics, two hits and another AL run. 
"Hey, I faced five, got three out, so that's the way I look at it," Smoltz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rick Sutcliffe, Chicago Cubs. Sutcliffe wasn't even supposed to be here. He 
spent Monday fishing and golfing with friends when he learned National League 
president Bill White was looking for him to replace Houston Astro pitcher Mike 
Scott on the All-Star roster. "I thought it was a joke at the beginning," he 
said. "My buddies are always trying to get one up on me." 
</P>
<P>
Less than 24 hours later, Sutcliffe, who had already pitched twice in the last 
five days, was on the mound getting waxed by greedy AL hitters. Four hits and 
two runs later, the third inning was mercifully over for the tired Cub. 
</P>
<P>
"My arm's kind of dead right now," he said. "I'm going to have to find a way to 
comb my hair first." 
</P>
<P>
Three pitchers, three innings, a second consecutive AL All-Star victory. 
</P>
<P>
It was supposed to be a game affected by the long shadows that creep across the 
field during late afternoon and early evening. Balls would dart in and out of 
the sunlight, enough so to baffle the best hitters in both leagues. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, well, it didn't quite work out that way. AL starter Dave Stewart 
discovered that much in his half of the first when he allowed two runs. But it 
was the trio of Reuschel, Smoltz and Sutcliffe who suffered the most. Reuschel 
served up those two home runs. Smoltz was named the losing pitcher. And 
Sutcliffe has to learn new grooming methods, what with a right arm that wasn't 
planning to do anything more strenuous this All-Star break than plucking beers 
from a cooler. 
</P>
<P>
First, Reuschel, who said the pitch that Jackson deposited in the center field 
seats was low, way low, a claim later supported by NL teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"It was on top of the plate," said Dodger reliever Jay Howell. 
</P>
<P>
So low was the pitch that when Jackson connected, "it looked like a Jack 
Nicklaus drive," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
Reuschel didn't bother looking at Jackson's hit, mostly because he expected it 
to land in a glove, not the cheap seats. "He showed me something," Reuschel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Next came Boggs, whose homer traveled considerably less, but counted the same. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just trying to throw a strike," Reuschel said. 
</P>
<P>
Smoltz took his place in the second inning, which is to say, he struggled at 
times. First pitch . . . a single by Texas Ranger Ruben Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
"That wasn't fair," Smoltz said. "He's not supposed to swing at the first 
pitch." 
</P>
<P>
An out later, Terry Steinbach singled, bringing up Jackson, who beat out what 
would have been a sure double play with most runners. Sierra scored on the 
play, sticking Smoltz with a run and ultimately, an All-Star loss. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, facing some of those guys, it was kind of a dream come true," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sutcliffe didn't know how to explain his appearance. One moment he's on the 
links, the next he's on the mound. His arm didn't know what hit him. 
</P>
<P>
"My arm's not used to pitching three times in five days," he said. "I guess I 
better stick to starting." 
</P>
<P>
Sutcliffe knew he was in trouble during his warmups. One version of his 
fastball did nothing, so he tried another. Even worse. Little changed when he 
trudged out there for the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the best I had," he said. "I knew I didn't have much." 
</P>
<P>
Turns out he wasn't alone.

ROBINSON'S FEUD WITH UMPS MAY AFFECT ORIOLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ROSENTHAL, The Baltimore Evening Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The danger is not that Frank Robinson will quit. Oh, he threatened as much, but 
it was heat-of-the-moment type stuff, not rational thought. The Baltimore 
Orioles are in first place at the All-Star break. It's highly doubtful the man 
who guided them there will jump ship. 
</P>
<P>
The real danger is exactly what Robinson fears -- the effect his fiery disputes 
with umpires will have on his young club. Robinson exploded after Sunday's 7-2 
loss to the Milwaukee Brewers, fuming over his treatment by umpires. His anger 
probably will subside. His problem may not. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things Sunday, Robinson accused umpire John Shulock of lying after 
hearing his post-game version of a contested play at second base. Then, 10 
minutes after his initial tirade, he dropped his bombshell: "I'm seriously 
thinking about stepping aside." 
</P>
<P>
Said Robinson: "How can I manage the ballclub the way I want to manage the 
ballclub? You tell me. I can't stand in the dugout and question a call. I can't 
go out on the field and talk about a play I think they missed. It's not fair to 
these guys (the players) if I can't manage the way I want." 
</P>
<P>
That wasn't all. Robinson also cursed Brewers Manager Tom Trebelhorn and called 
him "very ... unprofessional" for protesting the Orioles' protest of the game. 
It was a misunderstanding -- Trebelhorn actually objected to the way the 
umpires handled the protest -- but the perceived insult only fueled Robinson's 
rage. He said he lost respect for Trebelhorn. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, Robinson and Trebelhorn will patch up their differences, especially 
since they identified a common enemy. Robinson's threatened resignation is 
something else. The Orioles' coaching staff expressed shock when informed of 
the news, but hitting coach Tom McCraw said, "If that's what he said, I'm sure 
he's serious." Bullpen coach Elrod Hendricks said he knew nothing about it. 
Indeed, Robinson said the idea just popped into his head. 
</P>
<P>
The question is what happens next. McCraw charged that the umpires' treatment 
of Robinson may be racially motivated. Robinson is one of two black managers 
(the Toronto Blue Jays' Cito Gaston is the other) in the majors. McCraw also is 
black. All four umpires Sunday were white. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure he's getting more respect from umpires than he did before," McCraw 
said. "But they'll have to come around to the fact he's a good manager. A lot 
of them resent Frank, I truly believe that." 
</P>
<P>
Plate umpire Ken Kaiser denied any grudge against Robinson or his club. "If we 
didn't have it in for Earl Weaver, why would we have it in for Frank Robinson?" 
Kaiser said. "He's a small-time complainer compared to Earl. His timing may be 
a little off, that's all. He was a Hall of Fame player. He's got to realize 
umpires and players might not be on his level." 
</P>
<P>
The friction between Robinson and the umpires has been present since he took 
over as Orioles manager six games into last season, but it became intense on 
the club's 3-3 road trip. First-base coach Johnny Oates said an umpire in 
Toronto told him the Orioles were "the luckiest team in the world," but refused 
to identify who said it -- Greg Kosc, John Hirschbeck, Dale Ford or Larry 
Barnett. 
</P>
<P>
Are the Orioles victims of unfair treatment? Oates said no. "This is my first 
year in the league, but I don't see anything out of the ordinary," he said. "In 
this business, you can't take it personally. I think it was just a tough day 
for Frank. Wait 'til Thursday (when the season resumes). If we win, everything 
will be fine." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson was not ejected from Sunday's game; nor was he ejected Saturday night, 
when he had a heated exchange with crew chief Jim McKean and wound up arguing 
with every umpire but Shulock. As he walked off the field following the 
Orioles' 5-2 victory, Robinson said he told (umpire) Larry Young, "I dislike 
you as much as you dislike me." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday's turmoil erupted with the score tied 1-1 and none out in the fifth 
inning. Phil (5-for-5) Bradley was on first when Joe Orsulak hit a chopper up 
the middle. Bradley crashed into Brewers second baseman Jim Gantner as they 
reached second simultaneously, and Shulock called him out for interference. 
Shulock also called Orsulak out, saying Bradley's action thwarted a possible 
double play. 
</P>
<P>
It is a judgment call based on whether Gantner had the ball. Shulock told 
reporters he did not -- "There was contact before the ball was there," Shulock 
said. "That caused the interference." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson and Bradley, however, insisted Shulock told them precisely the 
opposite, that Gantner fielded the ball. "Then it's nothing more than a 
fielder's choice," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, Robinson filed his protest -- the Orioles were stifled by Chris 
Bosio (9-5, 2.76) and Tony Fossas the rest of the way, as Dave Schmidt (8-8, 
4.91) allowed 10 of the Brewers' 14 hits in six innings. Trebelhorn lodged his 
protest when Kaiser allowed play to continue instead of immediately noting 
Robinson's action. Trebelhorn said he was only trying to protect his club by 
objecting to procedure in the event Robinson wins his protest. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd of 39,238 booed when the public-address announcer said Robinson 
protested the game, then cheered Trebelhorn's apparent mockery of Robinson, 
which led to his mistaken appearance on Robinson's post-game hit list. "Frank 
did right. Frank did fine," Trebelhorn said. "This has nothing to do with 
Frank, nothing to do with the Baltimore Orioles. He doesn't know all of it." 
</P>
<P>
The real danger is not that Robinson will quit. The real danger is that the 
umpires, human beings that they are, might not forget. Which, ironically 
enough, was Robinson's point from the start.

REAGAN CAN'T HANDLE EASY PITCH FOR NBC

<TEXT>
<P>
Dutch Reagan, the oldtime Iowa sportscaster, made a comeback Tuesday night at 
the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
Well, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
Working the first inning with play-by-play announcer Vin Scully for NBC, Reagan 
showed he's a little rusty. 
</P>
<P>
He had said before the game that he was worried he might say the obvious. 
</P>
<P>
He did. 
</P>
<P>
When the game's first hitter, Ozzie Smith, was tagged out trying steal second, 
Scully dully noted, "They've got him." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan added: "And he's out." 
</P>
<P>
Then Reagan seemed to get a little lost when he asked: "That's Tony Gwynn?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, at the plate," Scully said. 
</P>
<P>
After Scully noted that Kevin Mitchell knocked in the game's first run, Reagan 
added, "It's a run batted in." 
</P>
<P>
Thanks, Ronnie. 
</P>
<P>
Well, at least you have to appreciate that Reagan agreed to make the guest 
appearance in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
Surely, he had to realize what he was getting into. 
</P>
<P>
TV sports critics generally are only slightly less vicious than political 
columnists. 
</P>
<P>
A week and a half ago, Reagan was bucked off a horse in Mexico. "I didn't fall 
off, I got thrown off," he told viewers Tuesday night. "I'm all black and blue 
under these clothes." 
</P>
<P>
The going was pretty rough Tuesday night as well. 
</P>
<P>
To his credit, Reagan seemed to realize it. Before giving way to Tom Seaver in 
the second inning, he said he was self-conscious and apologized for being 
"uptight." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, this assignment was tougher than a presidential press conference 
with Sam Donaldson sitting in the front row. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dick Ebersol, the new NBC Sports president, seemed pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"He'll be back for the opening game in 1994 after baseball returns to NBC where 
it belongs," quipped Ebersol. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' three-year contract with major league baseball begins next season. 
</P>
<P>
It was Ebersol's idea to invite Reagan to work an inning. "I called his main 
spokesman, Mark Weinburg, my second day on the job," Ebersol said. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, Weinburg said, 'No way,' but eventually we talked him into it." 
</P>
<P>
Reagan came prepared. He had read the press guides and drawn up diagrams and 
notecards for himself, Eberbol said. 
</P>
<P>
He informed viewers that Gwynn was the only player in the National League to 
play in every game last season. 
</P>
<P>
Not a bad stat. 
</P>
<P>
He told of how Mitchell was a former gang member in San Diego and that his 
brother was killed, a well-known story but worth repeating. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Reagan made the effort. But he was obviously nervous, which is 
interesting. We're not talking about someone who has never had to face a camera 
and microphone before. 
</P>
<P>
Making matters worse was that there were four runs scored and back-to-back home 
runs during the 25-minute inning Reagan was on stage. 
</P>
<P>
The hitters weren't having problems with the shadows. It was the former 
president who struck out. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, it was a fine night for NBC.

NO LONGER BOGGED DOWN, WADE BELTS ONE

<P>
Pete Rose has been something of a blessing for Wade Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball's investigation into the alleged gambling activities of the Cincinnati 
Red manager has helped people forget Boggs and his affair with Margo Adams. 
</P>
<P>
Comedian Jay Leno, at the All-Star gala Monday night at Disneyland, poked fun 
at Rose ("all things considered I'd rather give my money to a savings and 
loan") but didn't tell one joke relating to Boggs' affair. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Leno spotted Boggs and his wife, Debbie, seated near the stage, and opted 
for good taste. 
</P>
<P>
Debbie was sitting behind the plate at Anaheim Stadium Tuesday night, part of a 
crowd of 64,036 attending the 60th All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
The last time Boggs was in Anaheim with the Boston Red Sox was in mid-May. He 
spent almost half a day giving a deposition to Adams' attorney, heard Margo 
taunts from the crowd and seemed distracted and out of sync as he went 2 for 11 
in a three-game series. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night was considerably more pleasant, as much fun as Disneyland had 
been the night before. 
</P>
<P>
Has Rose replaced him as an object of fan ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about that, but I didn't hear one negative thing tonight," Boggs 
said. "Of course, I don't pay attention to it or let it bother me when I do." 
</P>
<P>
Boggs didn't give the crowd much chance Tuesday. He hit the sixth pitch Rick 
Reuschel threw him over the left-center field fence for his third All-Star hit 
in 10 at-bats and first home run, tying a game his American League team won, 
5-3. 
</P>
<P>
As he finished circling the bases, he pointed toward the seats behind the 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pointing toward my wife," Boggs said. "That was for her. That was 
special." 
</P>
<P>
He said it with a touch of emotion, as if maybe he was wiping his Orange County 
slate clean. 
</P>
<P>
The Big A is not far from the hotel where he first met Adams about five years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Now it's as if he never knows what to expect here, when the next reminder is 
likely to appear. 
</P>
<P>
Did the home run address those demons? 
</P>
<P>
"It helped," Boggs said. "It helped more than a single up the middle would 
have. At the start of the game I was walking around like an expectant father in 
a maternity ward. The home run calmed me down. It relaxed me more than I've 
been in a while." 
</P>
<P>
Boggs has won four consecutive American League batting titles and five in the 
last six years. He has 200 or more hits in six consecutive seasons, but home 
runs are not his specialty. He hit 24 in 1987, but has since hit only seven in 
896 regular-season at-bats or one every 128. 
</P>
<P>
He had arrived in Anaheim with a .322 average after a struggling start but had 
hit only two homers in 312 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson opened the bottom of the first by hitting Reuschel's second pitch 
onto the green canvas in dead center, a drive estimated at 448 feet. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to hit a dribbler up the middle after that," Boggs said. "That 
would have been a real letdown, but a home run was the last thing on my mind." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Boggs -- who didn't know if he would be able to play here until he 
received a cortisone injection Sunday for an ailing shoulder -- had given 
Jackson a word of encouragement just before Bo stepped to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to him, 'all right, let's do it,' " Boggs said. "I don't know if he 
took it in the context of back-to-back homers, but I only meant 'let's get 
something going.' " 
</P>
<P>
The National League had scored twice in the first. 
</P>
<P>
"All I wanted to do was see the ball and hit it hard," Boggs said. "I was 
concerned about the twilight, but Reuschel's pitches were coming out of the 
green backdrop and I saw them better than I saw some of the pitches later in 
the game. I worked the count to 3-and-2 and got a fastball up over the plate." 
</P>
<P>
Boggs hit it an estimated 398 feet, which doesn't compare with Bo's drive, but 
is a lot farther than Boggs normally hits them. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit a couple in that same area during batting practice yesterday, but it's 
definitely not my game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Red Sox Manager Joe Morgan, an All-Star coach, smiled and said: "He took a home 
run swing at that ball. It was up, and he whaled into it." 
</P>
<P>
Would Morgan like to see him do it more often? 
</P>
<P>
"At times, with men on base, I wouldn't mind it," he said. "But I don't want to 
take away from what he does best." 
</P>
<P>
What Boggs does best, of course, is slash singles and doubles and win batting 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
"He did it last year when all the distraction started, and he probably will do 
it again," Morgan said. "He's hitting .330 (.322) and he probably will hit .360 
again. Whatever it takes, he is capable of doing it." 
</P>
<P>
All of that is another reason the home run meant so much to Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have been happy with a single," he said. "But I get a lot of singles. 
A home run in an All-Star game is something I'll never forget, definitely a 
highlight of my career. I wish I could bottle the feeling and carry it with 
me." 
</P>
<P>
Where? San Francisco? Los Angeles? Atlanta? Chicago's Wrigley Field? 
</P>
<P>
Rumors of a trade persist, inflamed, in fact, by the three-year, $7.3-million 
contract Boggs signed with the Red Sox recently. The contract is devoid of a 
no-trade clause and there is less of a risk if a club deals for Boggs because 
he can't leave as a free agent when the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
Boggs shook his head and said he treats the rumors with the same disregard that 
he displays toward taunts from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox may not have forgiven him for the internal problems and 
embarrassments he created with the Adams' affair, but the fans seemed to have 
lost interest, the taunts becoming less frequent. Maybe he can thank Pete Rose 
for that. Maybe it's merely the march of time.

TRADING PLACES WORKS OUT FOR RANDOLPH, SAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SMITH, The Hartford Courant 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vindication is probably not a word one could easily drag from the lips of 
either the New York Yankees' Steve Sax or the Los Angeles Dodgers' Willie 
Randolph. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, there will have to be an immense sense of accomplishment when the two 
All-Stars look at each other from opposite sides of the field at Anaheim 
Stadium Tuesday night. After all, the two second basemen replaced one another, 
swapping uniforms, tradition, coasts, leagues and teams in a free-agent 
flip-flop overflowing with irony. 
</P>
<P>
Half a season later, the irony remains. But the discomfort caused by the two 
free-agent signings 3,000 miles apart last winter does not. Success is curing 
all the yearning, the mixed emotions, the uprooted feelings both players surely 
suffered at the outset of 1989. And both Sax and Randolph have succeeded. Their 
presence as all-stars proves that. 
</P>
<P>
"I just think I did the right thing," said Sax, a four-time all-star making his 
first appearance as an American Leaguer. "As it turned out, it was best for 
both of us. Willie has played great for the Dodgers and my career has gone 
great in New York. That's the way it should be." 
</P>
<P>
"It's sweet, real sweet just to be here," said Randolph, a six-time all-star 
but first-time National Leaguer. "It's nice to know you still can do it." 
</P>
<P>
"They are two different types of ballplayers, two different personalities," 
said Dodgers catcher Mike Scioscia, also an all-star. "For them to both have 
made it, it gives everyone a great feeling." 
</P>
<P>
That success has made it easier for Sax, who chose to leave the Dodgers and 
unwittingly displaced the popular Randolph. And living his new life well has 
also helped Randolph's outlook. Granted, he never wanted to leave the Bronx, 
but when Randolph says "I'm a Dodger, now," one senses his heart is finally in 
agreement with his head. 
</P>
<P>
Added to their peace of mind is the satisfaction both teams must feel. Yes, 
it's only a half a season, but so far, so good. No organization has been 
embarrassed. No calamities have been suffered. Randolph is healthy. Sax has not 
disintegrated under the white-hot lights of New York. It has been mutually 
beneficial. 
</P>
<P>
Sax earned his All-Star berth by hitting .327 and providing so much of a spark 
that he made Rickey Henderson expendable. Sax has scored 49 runs and driven in 
another 34. He has proven to be mentally tough in a town that routinely grinds 
up transplants from the laid-back West Coast. That quality in Sax has not been 
lost on his manager, who endorsed the signing, took a lot of heat, then waited 
to be vindicated. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing he's done is slowly, slowly gained respect, and in a way the kind of 
clubhouse leadership role I expected him to take all along," Yankee Manager 
Dallas Green said recently. "He didn't come in and jump up and down ringing 
bells about how great he was. Just through games played and work habits, he's 
let people see what kind of player he is." 
</P>
<P>
Sax, thought to be suspect defensively, has surprised. "I really didn't know 
what to expect, but he didn't get recognition as a good defensive player," said 
Don Mattingly, the Yankees' first-base Gold Glover and other all-star. "But I 
think he's got good range and he turns the double play well. And he doesn't 
throw the ball away." 
</P>
<P>
Randolph never had to prove such mundane things as his ability not to throw the 
ball away. He's always been smooth afield, second only to the Kansas City 
Royals' Frank White in his days in the American League. The Dodgers needed 
Randolph to do one other thing besides stay healthy: take the defense up 
another notch. Randolph has. He and shortstop Alfredo Griffin have given L.A. 
what General Manager Fred Claire calls the team's best double play combination 
since the Dodgers left Brooklyn. And Randolph, never one to brag, bluntly says, 
"I'm playing the best defense of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Randolph also added a big bonus by getting his offensive numbers back up after 
a couple of slow seasons. He ended the first half hitting .291. Randolph has 
driven in 22 runs and scored another 36. Randolph, who prefers to have his 
performance measured by on-base percentage, is satisfied with that number thus 
far -- .387. 
</P>
<P>
And while Sax merely needed to prove he could survive, Randolph felt he had 
something to prove, something that baseball players in mid-life career crises 
must meet up with eventually. Randolph had to prove he was not through. He knew 
that. His family knew it, too, even 8-year-old Andre, Randolph's son. 
</P>
<P>
"Andre told me he was proud of me when I told him I was named to the team," 
Randolph said. "That's the first time my son ever told me that. I almost 
cried." 
</P>
<P>
So the proving was all the more sweet. And not lost on new teammates or old. 
"He's just an utter professional," Scioscia said. "It's a pleasure to watch him 
play." 
</P>
<P>
So when the two All-Stars face each other during introductions, Dodgers and 
Yankees will pull for both. For the sake of Randolph and the sake of Sax, the 
rivalry has been put on hold. This time, a Dodgers-Yankees tie more than 
suffices. 
</P>
<P>
"It worked out for both guys," Mattingly said. "You have to be glad for that."

A'S GLAD THEY GOT PRODUCTIVE RICKEY HENDERSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE DONNELLY, Newsday 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rickey Henderson is alive and, well, thriving in Oakland. The struggle of his 
65 games with the New Yankees this season is behind. It is only 17 games since 
his return home but in that short time, the Oakland Athletics have seen enough 
to know he remains a special player. 
</P>
<P>
"He's handled himself like a total professional in every way," A's Manager Tony 
La Russa said Sunday. "We gave up a lot to bring him back, but not too much. 
There is no doubt in my mind that Luis Polonia is going to be a plus for the 
Yankees. He does a lot of things like Rickey but not quite as much. When Rickey 
is right, he's arguably the best in the game." 
</P>
<P>
Rickey has been oh so right since the June 21 trade. Line drives have been 
jumping off his bat, his on-base percentage with the A's is a phenomenal .513 
and he has scored 22 runs. 
</P>
<P>
No, there isn't anybody quite like Henderson when he gets it going. If he 
wasn't himself the first 2 1/2 months, look at how he can restore perspective 
of his worth in less than three weeks. Bottom-line baseball is runs scored, and 
nobody in the majors has more than Henderson's 63. 
</P>
<P>
The A's have been struggling, waiting for the return of Dennis Eckersley from 
the disabled list and Jose Canseco from minor-league rehabilitation. They are 
second in the American League West, 1 1/2 games behind the California Angels. 
They have scored only 17 runs in their past four games and Henderson has eight 
of those. "We're 8-9 with him and we'd be about 4-13 without him," said A's 
General Manager Sandy Alderson. 
</P>
<P>
Alderson, utilizing scouting reports, engineered the deal with the Yankees. He 
looked beyond the .247 Henderson was hitting and put his faith in a .394 
on-base percentage. "If he can do that (on-base percentage) the rest of the 
way," Alderson said, "that would be good enough for us. 
</P>
<P>
"We realized they weren't going to give away a Rickey Henderson for nothing. 
Eric Plunk has pitched very well for them. Polonia is a good player, and he 
certainly is a crowd-pleaser. But there's only one Rickey Henderson." 
</P>
<P>
On the plane trip from New York, the 29-year-old Henderson did some 
soul-searching of his own. He was going home, and while that was intense 
gratification, somewhere up there on Cloud 9 he recalls wondering whether not 
being wanted in New York demanded any changes in his playing approach. 
</P>
<P>
Rickey wanted to remain Rickey, instant offense on the bases, but he decided 
upon modification. He would abandon, at least temporarily, the snatch catch, 
that one-handed swipe of a fly ball across his chest that was as indelibly his 
as Pete Rose running to first after a walk. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to see the player Rickey Henderson is," he said Sunday. "I got to 
thinking people might think I'm a hot dog. Right now I'm going to do the basic 
things. I look back at some of the stuff and I thought, let's go with basics. I 
don't want people to think I'm a hot dog." 
</P>
<P>
The A's, when healthy, have an abundance of talent. Henderson knew he wasn't 
coming to be the show but to add to it. Dave Parker sensed where Rickey was 
coming from soon after Henderson joined the A's. 
</P>
<P>
"He's made a lot of money," Parker said. "You start to look at things in a 
different perspective. He's home, he's with a good ballclub and he's looking to 
be a part of what he's missed. That's winning it all. We all have the same goal 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"Players on a lot of other teams may have the same goal but it's not as 
realistic. Rickey hasn't done anything but shine since he's been here. I don't 
see how anybody could have any problem with him. He's low-key. I spend a lot of 
time with him on flights. Play cards, laugh. Heck of a guy. I've spent time 
with a lot worse people in this game, believe me. I think he's come over to 
conform to team rules, and do everything in a basic way to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
Parker's assessment is on target. "To be an all-time king of stolen bases is 
important to me," said Henderson, who is fourth with 830 steals, 108 behind Lou 
Brock. "But I want to get that ring. The ultimate stuff is to be part of a unit 
that is the best." 
</P>
<P>
He became convinced it wasn't going to happen for him with the Yankees. 
"There's always confusion, always change," he said. "They don't get to know 
each other enough to believe in each other." 
</P>
<P>
He is summing up rather than knocking because he still wishes he could have 
been with a Yankee winner. "I have no regrets about New York. I would never say 
I wouldn't play there," said Henderson, who remains unsigned beyond this year 
and is eligible to be a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to win there. We had one chance, '85. We should have won. But there 
was the same old problem near the end. Too much confusion. Yet I still follow 
them on my satellite and check their boxscores. I miss some of those guys. If 
there are guys you want to play with, they are guys like Jesse Barfield. 
</P>
<P>
"I scored a lot of runs for Don Mattingly. He's going to miss me. I'm going to 
miss him, too. We became good friends. I wish those guys well. I wish they 
could win their division. But I don't think they will. Too much confusion."

REVENUE-RAISING TAX PLAN UNVEILED BY ROSTENKOWSKI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM REDBURN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) on Tuesday 
laid out his own road map for raising $5.3 billion in additional revenue next 
year, proposing among other things to hit pipe smokers and tobacco chewers. 
</P>
<P>
His plan also calls for a continuation of current taxes on airline tickets and 
telephone bills, for limits on a variety of corporate tax breaks and for a 
higher ceiling on Social Security taxes. 
</P>
<P>
The package, which meets the budget target established by Congress earlier this 
year, contained few surprises. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers on the tax-writing committee are not expected to make major changes 
in Rostenkowski's specific proposals. However, they are likely to recommend 
tackling such other issues as expanding child-care tax benefits, reducing the 
surtax that is scheduled to pay for Medicare coverage for catastrophic 
illnesses and cutting taxes on capital gains. Although Rostenkowski said that 
he hopes to complete action this week, the debate is expected to continue into 
next week and possibly longer. 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski's proposal contains almost no changes directly affecting 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few that would affect individuals would sharply boost the tax on 
pipe tobacco, snuff and chewing tobacco. Another would raise the current 
$48,000 ceiling on wages subject to Social Security tax by roughly $1,000 above 
the normal annual inflationary increase. That action would add an estimated 
$1.1 billion to Social Security taxes paid by affluent workers when fully 
implemented in fiscal 1991. But benefits would also increase for retirees, 
eventually costing the government more in outlays than the revenue gained from 
the change. 
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for extending the 3% tax on telephone calls for at least 
one more year, but few lawmakers expect that the tax will be allowed to expire. 
Similarly, current law would cut in half various aviation taxes, including 
levies on tickets, fuel and cargo shipments. Rostenkowski's proposal would keep 
the taxes at their present levels for another year. 
</P>
<P>
As he had proposed earlier, Rostenkowski took aim at the increasingly popular 
corporate practice of establishing employee stock ownership plans, or ESOPs, to 
help ward off hostile takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
The plan to eliminate the existing 50% exclusion for interest payments used to 
finance ESOPs is the biggest revenue generator in the package. It would add an 
estimated $1.27 billion in revenue for fiscal 1990, which begins on Oct. 1, and 
$10.18 billion over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski's ESOP proposal, which he recommended be retroactive to June 7, 
could affect both Xerox Corp. and Delta Airlines, which both proposed ESOPs on 
Monday as part of their own defenses against potential takeovers. Although 
Xerox said it did not think legislation would affect its ESOP plan, the company 
would need a special exemption to avoid the proposed measure. 
</P>
<P>
Also hitting ESOPs was another Rostenkowski recommendation that would repeal a 
deduction allowed employers for certain dividends on securities held by an 
employee stock plan. That would raise $368 million next year and $3 billion 
over five years. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration also had recommended keeping the airline and telephone 
taxes and suggested roughly $500 million in minor corporate tax measures, 
contending that none of its proposals violate President Bush's "no new taxes" 
pledge. The Administration, however, may oppose Rostenkowski's proposal to 
impose higher taxes on pipe smokers and snuff users and a plan to limit tax 
deductions on Third World bank loans, committee aides said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Committed to $5.3 Billion' 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski's proposal, which would raise an estimated $31.9 billion over the 
next five years, does not include any revenues to maintain a number of popular 
tax credits that are supposed to expire this year, such as those for low-income 
housing, mortgage bonds and corporate research and development. 
</P>
<P>
"If my colleagues want to do anything to raise revenues (to extend expiring tax 
breaks), that's up to them," Rostenkowski told reporters. "I'm just committed 
to the $5.3 billion." 
</P>
<P>
Rostenkowski, as expected, did not include any proposal to change the capital 
gains tax. However, the Bush Administration is expected to press the committee 
to lower the tax on profits from investment in stocks, bonds and similar 
assets.

Checchi Gets Request for Data: The Department of Transportation asked Los 
Angeles investor Alfred A. Checchi for more details about his proposed 
$4.05-billion acquisition of the parent of Northwest Airlines. DOT said it 
wanted financial forecasts, aircraft acquisition plans and details about debt 
financing. A spokesman for Checchi called the request "routine." Checchi plans 
to meet with Northwest pilots today to sell them on the transaction, which 
involves $3.35 billion in debt. The pilots, the only labor group at Northwest 
without a contract, are dismayed with the debt that would be imposed on the 
company, which is subject to shareholder and government approval.

United Flight Attendants Vote to Strike: Flight attendants at United Airlines 
have overwhelmingly voted to authorize a strike, the Assn. of Flight Attendants 
said. However, negotiations between the union and United are under the 
supervision of a federal mediator who would have to declare an impasse and 
order a 30-day cooling-off period before a strike could be called. The 
negotiations are in recess. The union represents about 13,500 United attendants 
and has been negotiating with the carrier for nearly two years.

Merger Postponed: The U.S. 9th Circuit Court in San Francisco granted the 
California attorney general's request to postpone for 30 days the merger of 
American Stores' Lucky and Alpha Beta supermarket chains, according to Sanford 
N. Gruskin, an assistant attorney general. The delay was granted so that the 
attorney general's office could appeal to the Supreme Court in the hope of 
permanently blocking the merger, which it claims will result in higher food 
prices. Gruskin said that for the postponement to take effect the attorney 
general's office must post a bond to cover any losses that American Stores 
might incur should the Supreme Court turn down the appeal. The size of that 
bond is to be determined by the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.

B-2 IS KEY TO U.S. DEFENSE STRATEGY, CONGRESS TOLD

The Air Force, hoping to stem congressional opposition to the B-2 bomber, said 
Tuesday that the radar-eluding aircraft outpaces 20 years of improvements in 
the Soviet air defense and is key to the U.S. strategic force. 
</P>
<P>
"The estimate is the Soviets have invested the equivalent of over $350 billion 
in those defenses over the 20-year period . . . and that investment continues," 
the Air Force said in an 18-page report released by the ranking members of the 
Senate Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
"That very expensive array of defenses is largely ineffective against an 
aircraft with B-2 capabilities," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
In a closed session, Air Force Secretary Donald Rice and Air Force Chief of 
Staff Larry Welch briefed members of the Senate Armed Services Committee on the 
B-2, detailing the aircraft's importance to the strategic forces, its 
conventional capability and its role if a strategic arms reduction treaty is 
reached with the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Sens. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the panel, and John Warner of Virginia, its 
ranking Republican, released the report. 
</P>
<P>
"We asked the Air Force to address the key issues of cost, flight testing and 
the comparable worth of the B-2 as the Congress debates the defense program," 
Nunn and Warner said in a one-page statement accompanying the report. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition in Congress is based on the bomber's price tag, estimated at between 
$500 million and $750 million per plane, and the delay in its first flight. 
</P>
<P>
The bomber, built by Northrop Corp., moved under its own power for the first 
time Monday when it taxied along an airfield runway at Palmdale. It is 
scheduled to make its maiden flight sometime in the next two weeks, 18 months 
behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"I have serious concerns about the aircraft," said Senate Armed Services member 
John McCain (R-Ariz.), who attended the Air Force briefing. The service "must 
prove this aircraft before full-scale production." 
</P>
<P>
Another member of the Senate panel, Democrat John Glenn of Ohio, last month 
urged Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to push back procurement of the aircraft, 
questioning the wisdom of "buy before you fly."

<P>
Lehigh Acres is a typical town in southern Florida, a planned community with 
25,000 residents, an industrial park, a pizza parlor, two Chinese restaurants, 
a hardware supply store and a newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
But it claims one distinction: Because of the savings and loan crisis, it is 
owned by the American taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
The federal government owns the hardware store, the newspaper, two 18-hole golf 
courses, a 121-room motel and its restaurant, a 1,700-seat auditorium, more 
than 10% of Lehigh's 60,500 acres and even the town's largest employer, Land 
Resources Corp. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, it is because of Land Resources that the government owns the rest. 
Land Resources -- which founded, built and owned Lehigh Acres -- was one of the 
assets of a failed savings and loan in Arizona that was taken over by the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Now Lehigh Acres is for sale as federal officials scramble to reduce the 
taxpayers' cost of cleaning up the savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
Federal S&amp;L regulators in effect have put up a big "for sale" sign on the 
town's front lawn, aggressively seeking bids from as far away as Asia and 
Europe to try to find a buyer willing to invest in an entire community. 
</P>
<P>
In a brochure soon to be mailed to potential bidders, the government says its 
property in Lehigh Acres, an unincorporated town 12 miles southeast of Ft. 
Myers, also includes a utility company, which operates water and sewer systems, 
a propane gas delivery system and a trash collection service. 
</P>
<P>
"Lehigh Acres is as close to owning a town as you can come, and there's no 
question the federal government owns it lock, stock and barrel," said William 
W. Crocker, the government-appointed president of Security Savings &amp; Loan 
in Scottsdale, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
Security, which owned Land Resources, is being operated by federal regulators 
until they can sell it or close it after Congress passes savings and loan 
bailout legislation, which will provide the funds to pay off depositors. 
</P>
<P>
"S&amp;Ls have often ended up owning things they didn't intend to," Crocker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
S&amp;L regulators in Washington can get a chuckle out of the situation, 
acknowledging that it underscores the absurdity as well as the gravity of the 
nationwide S&amp;L problem. Hundreds of bankrupt S&amp;Ls have been seized by 
regulators in recent years, and many more will be taken over in the months 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, the federal government expects to wind up owning as much as 
$500 billion worth of property, an amount that even veteran real estate 
managers have trouble imagining. 
</P>
<P>
Failed financial institutions have dumped into the government's lap such 
unlikely holdings as race horses, McDonald's restaurants, a bordello in Nevada, 
a major share of the Dallas Cowboys and a nitrogen-cooled tank filled with 
vials of buffalo semen. 
</P>
<P>
And now a town. 
</P>
<P>
"Repossessed real estate is going to be the No. 1 business problem facing the 
Southwest and many other areas of the country in the years ahead," said 
Arizona's supervisor of financial institutions, Hank Rivoir, expressing a 
sentiment many regulators share. 
</P>
<P>
The story of how the federal government came to possess the key to an entire 
town began in 1983, when Security Savings &amp; Loan bought a 64% stake in Land 
Resources as an investment. 
</P>
<P>
The acquisition, which meant that Security would have about 15% of its assets 
in one investment, was contingent on the Arizona Legislature's willingness to 
pass a bill to permit a state-chartered S&amp;L such as Security to invest that 
much in one property. The Legislature obliged. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Security ended up with 100% ownership of Land Resources when it had to 
step in and pay more than $100 million in debt that the developer owed to 
Citicorp. 
</P>
<P>
Security itself then went into decline and this spring was among more than 200 
savings and loans that federal regulators seized because they were in such bad 
financial shape. 
</P>
<P>
The development company created Lehigh in 1954 by buying what was then called 
the Lucky Lee Cattle Ranch in Lee County. The county was named after 
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, and, because the ranch was on the county's 
highest ground, the town was named Lehigh. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Lehigh has 1,450 miles of paved roads, four shopping centers, an 
industrial complex, two elementary schools, a middle school, a hospital, three 
banks, five S&amp;Ls and 20 churches. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is unincorporated, it has no official local government, although it 
has an honorary mayor, Liz Eils. It is governed by Lee County, which provides 
police and fire protection and public education. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been successful as a community if not as a business investment," said 
Charles Bigelow, chairman of the county commissioners of Lee County. 
</P>
<P>
County officials and employees of Land Resources interviewed in recent days 
said they were vaguely aware that Land Resources's parent company, Security 
Savings &amp; Loan, was in financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
They did not know, however, that it has been taken over by the government, and 
that, as a result, Land Resources and Lehigh Acres had been, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not aware that the federal government was the developer," Bigelow said. 
"We've never dealt with a developer with an army before." 
</P>
<P>
Upon learning that a foreign owner might take over the company, the editor of 
the Lehigh Times, Judi Barker, an 11-year resident of the town, said, "Egad." 
</P>
<P>
Said county official Bigelow: "The company, it appears, has kind of been 
limping along, so some new vigor would be welcome." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, there are some advantages in the federal government's role as 
the town's owner. "As you can imagine, the newspaper is very kind to us," said 
Crocker, the government's man at Security Savings.

distributor of wigs and hairpieces, was a subsidiary of Western Auto Supply 
Co., which was acquired by Sears in April, 1988. Minority stockholders, 
including Eva Gabor, have also sold their interests, but Gabor will remain

TAKEOVER NEWS SPURS MARKET; DOW UP 11.95

<P>
The stock market rallied Tuesday, extending its gains for a sixth straight 
session as news of a fresh blockbuster takeover bid lured bystanders back into 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index finished up 11.95 at 2,514.61, but that was well 
below its high for the day as profit taking eroded some of the market's early 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
Gaining issues outnumbered losers by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading of New 
York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 926 up, 579 down and 500 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 171.59 million shares, up from 131.87 million Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Tobacco issues led the advance, buoyed by a $21.2-billion bid for Britain's BAT 
Industries PLC by raider Sir James Goldsmith and two of his associates. 
</P>
<P>
The bid for BAT is the largest in British history and second in size only to 
another tobacco-giant takeover, Kohlberg Kravis &amp; Co.'s $25-billion bid for 
RJR Nabisco, which was completed earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
News of the bid for BAT boosted tobacco shares by fueling takeover speculation 
in the group and highlighting their bargain prices relative to their strong 
growth prospects, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
"The strength started in American Brands and Philip Morris and then spread to 
food stocks -- anything you put in your mouth," said Trude Latimer at 
Josephthal &amp; Co. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices closed well below their session highs, however, as the market's 
advance spurred investors to take profits and triggered futures-related 
selling. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow index previously touched a session high of 2,531.11, a level of strong 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
American Depositary Receipts for BAT, traded on the American Stock Exchange, 
jumped 2-15/16 to 14 3/8 on news of a $13.94-a-share bid from Goldsmith's 
group. The stock was the most actively traded on the exchange, with 7.07 
million shares changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
Tobacco and food giant Philip Morris Cos. rose 2 1/8 to 143 3/4 in sympathy, 
while American Brands Inc. gained 1 1/2 to 71 3/8. UST Inc. climbed 1 1/8 to 26 
7/8, and Loews Corp. advanced 2 3/4 to 115 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
Another gainer among the blue chips included International Paper, up 3/4 to 47 
1/4, which announced improved second-quarter income. 
</P>
<P>
UAL, recently pushed aloft by takeover talk, pulled back by 2 7/8 to 165 5/8. 
The American Stock Exchange index rose 1.59 to 366.03, its third-highest close; 
trading volume was the heaviest so far this year, with 18.4 million shares 
changing hands Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo stocks also closed higher in light trading with institutional investors 
staying on the sidelines awaiting signs that Japan's shaky political situation 
will be resolved. The 225-share Nikkei index added 70.75 to close at 33,746.77 
after slipping 27.95 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Stock prices soared in London after the unexpected takeover bid for BAT. The 
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 55.7 to 2,250.9. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended higher against key foreign currencies after major banks again 
failed to follow Chase Manhattan Bank's cut in the prime lending rate. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices eased. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for 
current delivery fell $3.10 to $381.50 an ounce. Republic National Bank of New 
York quoted a late bid for gold at $379 an ounce, down from $382.50 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Also helping the dollar Tuesday was an increase in trading of the West German 
mark against Britain's pound sterling and the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose 0.34 yen to 139.62 yen in Tokyo and was quoted at 140.25 yen in 
London and at 140.75 yen in New York, up from 130.20 yen Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The dollar was stronger against the British pound. It cost $1.6270 to buy one 
pound in London, cheaper than $1.6410 late Monday. Sterling fetched $1.6235 in 
New York, down from $1.6390. 
</P>
<P>
Gold eased in London to a late bid of $380.25 an ounce, compared to late 
Monday's $381.75. In Zurich, Switzerland, it fell to $379.75 from $383.45. 
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.49 to close at $381.78. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Prices of frozen pork belly futures sank below 30 cents a pound on the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange amid renewed concern about the glut of bellies clogging the 
nation's commercial freezers. 
</P>
<P>
Hog futures also retreated while cattle futures rose. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, grains and soybeans were sharply lower, energy futures 
advanced and precious metals were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Frozen pork bellies settled 0.43 cent to 1.80 cents lower, with the contract 
for delivery this month at 28.97 cents a pound, matching the nine-year low 
reached May 31. 
</P>
<P>
The trading reflected expectations that a weekly exchange report would show no 
significant decline in the amount of pork bellies in cold storage outside 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The report, issued after trading closed, showed an unexpectedly large drawdown 
of 4.6 million pounds, which analysts said could prompt buying of futures 
today. 
</P>
<P>
But frozen stocks of bellies, which are cured and sliced to make bacon, still 
are believed to be at near-record levels as the end of the heaviest usage 
period approaches. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Levitt, chief livestock market analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., 
said he expects the Agriculture Department's July 21 cold-storage report to 
show about 128 million pounds of frozen bellies on hand as of July 1, which 
would be the second-highest total on record for that date and 1 1/2 times the 
10-year average. 
</P>
<P>
The July 1 record high was 133.2 million pounds in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Most bond prices finished unchanged to lower in thin trading, after an early 
advance stalled. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond ended down 5/16 point, or about $3 
for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite 
direction from price, rose to 8.03% from 8% late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the session, the yield briefly had dipped to 7.97% -- the lowest 
level since April 8, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, finished 
at 9.188%, unchanged.

BID TO CORNER SOYBEAN MARKET SPURS ACTION

The Chicago Board of Trade issued an emergency order Tuesday aimed at breaking 
up an attempted corner of the soybean market, described by one analyst as "the 
biggest market play since the Hunts'." 
</P>
<P>
The exchange's board of directors ordered all traders holding commitments to 
buy or sell more than 3 million bushels of soybeans for delivery this month to 
reduce those positions by at least 20% each trading day through July 20, when 
the July contract expires. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the order would likely result in a sharp drop in the July 
contract's price at the opening of trading today. 
</P>
<P>
Board of Trade spokesmen would not identify the parties involved but confirmed 
that the emergency resolution was designed to avert the crisis that would occur 
if the supply of soybeans available for delivery was too small to satisfy the 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
William Biedermann, director of research with Allendale Inc., a Chicago-area 
futures brokerage, said the situation was rooted in a large foreign-based grain 
company's accumulation over the past 1 1/2 years of about 30 million bushels of 
soybeans -- enough to control the market. 
</P>
<P>
"It's probably the biggest story since Bunker Hunt tried to squeeze silver," 
Biedermann said, referring to the alleged attempt by the Hunt brothers to 
control the world silver market several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Futures are binding contracts to deliver or take delivery of a set amount of a 
commodity at an agreed-upon price at a future date. A typical corner occurs 
when a trader holding a large number of contracts to take delivery also owns so 
much of the commodity that those on the other side cannot acquire enough to 
honor their delivery commitments. 
</P>
<P>
The artificial supply squeeze causes the price of the commodity to soar until 
the player working the corner sells out at a huge profit. 
</P>
<P>
July soybeans settled Tuesday at $7.26 a bushel, compared to $6.64 for 
September delivery, a difference of 62 cents a bushel or $3,100 per 
5,000-bushel contract.

PANEL VOTES TO ABOLISH S&amp;L INSURING AGENCIES

<P>
A House-Senate conference committee Tuesday voted to abolish the U.S. agencies 
that regulate and insure accounts at federal savings and loan associations and 
transfer their operations to other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The action came on the opening day of a conference to resolve differences 
between House and Senate bills to bail out the thrift industry by closing or 
merging failing associations. 
</P>
<P>
The bills would authorize a $50-billion federal bond issue to close hundreds of 
S&amp;Ls, tighten financial rules for thrifts and increase penalties for bank 
fraud. The Senate bill passed in April; the House legislation was approved in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
Most functions of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and its Federal Savings and 
Loan Insurance Corp. would be transferred to the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp., the bank insurer that has taken over operations of many failing thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would also create a Resolution Trust Corp. to manage and resolve 
failed S&amp;Ls and establish an office of thrift supervision in the Treasury 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday, the conferees also voted to establish a regional office in Dallas 
to investigate S&amp;L fraud in the Southwest. The House bill originally called 
for such offices in both Dallas and Los Angeles, while the Senate version 
provided for none. The compromise cut out the proposed Los Angeles office. 
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Thomas Foley urged members to work quickly so that Congress could 
pass the bill before its summer recess begins Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
A key issue that the conference must decide is whether the total cost of the 
bill, estimated at $157 billion by the Bush Administration and much higher by 
other economists, will be included in the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady wants the plan off-budget and has hinted that 
he might recommend that Bush veto the bill if the cost is on-budget. The House 
voted to put the costs in the budget, but the Senate kept the costs off the 
budget.

MGM/UA Communications Co.: The Beverly Hills-based film and entertainment 
company reported a third-quarter net loss of $7.1 million, compared to a net 
loss of $8.3 million a year ago. Revenue totaled $267.8 million, up 53%. The 
firm noted that although revenue was boosted by the worldwide box-office 
performance of the films "Rain Man" and "A Fish Called Wanda," losses were 
incurred due to a decrease in the number of feature films in production, higher 
non-recurring corporate expenses (including those related to MGM/UA's merger 
with Qintex Entertainment Inc.), and writedowns on recent motion picture 
releases.

MARRIOTT WILL SELL CATERING UNIT TO ONE OF NWA'S BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marriott Corp., the nation's largest hotel operator, agreed Tuesday to sell its 
leading airline catering business to an investment group that includes Frederic 
V. Malek, a former Marriott president who participated in the recent buyout of 
Northwest Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
The price was not disclosed, but lodging industry analysts estimated the price 
at $650 million. 
</P>
<P>
Marriott had previously said it planned to sell the catering unit -- Marriott 
In-Flite Services -- in order to concentrate on its hotels and restaurant 
operations. Though the airline catering business is profitable, lodging 
industry analysts said it is growing at a rate of 5% a year, about half the 
growth rate of Marriott's other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Marriott, based in Bethesda, Md., said it would use the proceeds from the sale 
to reduce its debt. "It will make Marriott more flexible to grow faster," said 
Michael Mueller, a lodging industry analyst with Montgomery Securities in San 
Francisco. "It makes a lot of sense." 
</P>
<P>
The deal is the second airline-related transaction in three weeks for Malek, an 
equity partner with Alfred A. Checchi in his $4.05-billion winning bid for NWA 
Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines. In an interview, Malek said no special 
relationship between Northwest or the catering company is contemplated. 
Currently, Northwest is a Marriott customer for the meals served to passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1937, Marriott In-Flite Services is the largest airline catering 
business in the world. Serving 150 airlines from 83 airports, it is twice the 
size of its next largest competitors, Dobbs International and Sky Chef. It has 
annual revenue of $800 million and, Mueller estimated, operating income of $60 
million. It employs 19,000 worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Mueller said Marriott dominates the airline catering business by strict 
attention to detail and an ability to motivate hourly workers who prepare and 
deliver the food. "They are more sophisticated than their competitors," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Malek, other members of the acquisition group are 40 high-level 
executives from Marriott's airline catering unit, including Daniel J. 
Altobello, president of Marriott's airport operations group. Marriott will 
continue to own a "significant" stake in the catering business, which will 
continue to operate under the Marriott name, Altobello said. 
</P>
<P>
Altobello said he plans to offer ownership stakes to 100 middle managers "right 
down to the kitchen general manager." 
</P>
<P>
Altobello said he sees strong growth opportunities for the company as airlines 
begin to emphasize service over ticket costs. He said he believes that the 
catering company will be able to react more quickly to changes in the 
marketplace since it is no longer "a small part of a giant company." Marriott 
has about $7.4 billion in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Financing for the acquisition is being arranged by the Carlyle Group, a 
Washington merchant bank. Malek is a senior adviser to the Carlyle Group, which 
will also acquire a small equity stake in the catering company.

GANG CRIME IN VALLEY NEARLY TRIPLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gang-related crime in the San Fernando Valley nearly tripled during the first 
six months of the year, the Los Angeles Police Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
Gang crime, including murders, assaults, robberies, rape and other crimes, rose 
from 201 reports in the first six months of 1988 to 578 reports in the first 
half of this year, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Cliff Ruff, head of a Valley gang task force, said the 188% increase, 
primarily led by major jumps in felony assaults and robberies, was believed to 
be caused by increased gang membership and drug activity. He estimated that 
there are 7,500 gang members in the Valley. Last year, the department had 
documented about 6,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
The crime comparison between the first six months of each year showed that 
homicides rose from 11 in 1988 to 15 this year, felony assaults rose from 116 
to 350 and robberies went from 27 to 145, Ruff said. The department's 
statistical report also showed that rapes involving gang members rose from one 
to four during the period, arson went from one to two, battery on a police 
officer rose from four to 11 and cases of witness intimidation rose from two to 
five. 
</P>
<P>
Only attempted murders dropped during the comparison period, from 37 in 1988 to 
35 this year, Ruff said.

The often-married Hungarian-born actress appeared in Beverly Hills Municipal 
Court and denied one count each of battery on a police officer, disobeying a 
police officer and having an expired driver's license. Gabor, who lists her age

alcohol in a vehicle and having an expired vehicle registration. 
</P>

In an effort to reach an early agreement, the NATO allies will present to the 
Warsaw Pact two months ahead of schedule their proposal to reduce troops and 
non-nuclear armories in Europe, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said the broadened proposal, to be presented in Vienna Thursday, will 
specify that each side have no more than 5,700 combat aircraft and 1,900 combat 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
"By tabling this proposal, we are taking a step toward ending the military 
division of Europe," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, developed to counter overtures by Soviet President Mikhail 
S. Gorbachev, both the United States and Soviet Union would reduce military 
manpower -- both ground and air forcetroops -- in Europe to 275,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the proposal will call for mutual reductions to 20,000 tanks and 
20,000 troop carriers each, and a limit on artillery pieces of between 16,500 
and 24,000 for each side, depending on definitions for each weapon agreed upon 
by the two sides, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's session of the Vienna arms talks is the last scheduled before a long 
summer recess. Submission of NATO's proposal before the recess gives the 
Soviets and their allies nearly two months to prepare a reply. 
</P>
<P>
The Vienna negotiations, known as Conventional Forces in Europe or CFE, have 
had a sporadic history stretching back more than 15 years. President Bush has 
insisted the imbalance in conventional forces -- the Warsaw Pact has a 
substantial edge in quantity if not quality over NATO -- must be addressed 
before talks are held on the elimination of short-range, or battlefield, 
nuclear weapons, as proposed by Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
Baker linked the decision to move quickly on arms control to Bush's visit to 
Poland and Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
"These efforts complement each other, and we think, together, advance the cause 
of a Europe which is whole and a Europe which is free." 
</P>
<P>
Baker insisted the timetable of an accord in a year is not unrealistic, 
pointing out that NATO is running 60 days ahead of its schedule. 
</P>
<P>
He rejected, meanwhile, a Soviet contention that another Bush timetable -- 
accomplishing the reductions by 1993 -- cannot be met. 
</P>
<P>
Baker said Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn had given assurances that the 
Warsaw Pact decided at a meeting last week not to let the quest for an 
agreement get bogged down in details. 
</P>
<P>
Baker today also praised the Soviets for accepting a U.S. proposal for trial 
monitoring of a still-unfinished strategic weapons limitation treaty. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it is very good that the Soviets have responded positively," Baker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite complaints by several private American analysts that it is a stalling 
tactic, Baker said trial monitoring "might well move arms control forward 
rather than retarding it." 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations to cut long-range nuclear bombers, missiles and submarines by 
30% to 50% are being held in Geneva. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor P. 
Karpov said Monday he accepted the Bush Administration's argument that the two 
sides could avoid misunderstandings by finishing trial weapons inspections 
before the agreement is concluded.

Defeated Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, 70, plans to marry his 
mistress, 34-year-old airline hostess Dimitra Liani, Thursday but a series of 
political scandals will block any honeymoon plans. 
</P>
<P>
The socialist politician, whose three-year affair caused constant headlines, is 
a target of criminal investigation into multimillion-dollar scandals that 
helped cause his crushing electoral defeat in June. 
</P>
<P>
The low-key marriage has been hailed by Greek newspapers as a major social 
event, comparable to the 1968 wedding of Jacqueline Kennedy to shipping magnate 
Aristotle Onassis. Newspapers say Papandreou, who could face prosecution in 
scandals that include embezzlement from a major bank, will wed Liani in a small 
church near their luxury villa in the Athens suburb of Ekali. None of 
Papandreou's four children from his marriage to American Margaret Chant are 
expected to attend.

Two fugitive leaders of China's pro-democracy movement appeared in public today 
for the first time since the uprising was crushed by troops in Beijing last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Wuerkaixi and Li Lu, wanted by China for inciting rebellion, emerged under 
heavy guard at a ceremony to unveil a replica of the Goddess of Democracy 
statue erected in the Chinese capital's Tien An Men Square during mass 
demonstrations.As the two appeared at a Paris science center, surrounded by a 
group of 10 plainclothes bodyguards, a crowd of about 50 people gasped in 
surprise and cheered loudly. 
</P>
<P>
Li, who said he helped build the original goddess torn down on June 4 by 
Chinese troops, said: "The statue is a symbol of hope for Chinese people. Now 
that I have seen it again, it is like seeing more hope for China." 
</P>
<P>
Beijing has protested to France about harboring the dissidents, saying they are 
plotting to overthrow the Chinese government. 
</P>
<P>
French Culture Minister Jack Lang arrived earlier than the students at the 
unveiling. His appearance with the dissidents was likely to infuriate Chinese 
authorities further. 
</P>
<P>
The French government has supported the Chinese students who built the statue 
reminiscent of a major French gift to the United States, the Statue of Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin today told Chinese officials 
they must work harder to counter Western "rumors" about the crackdown on 
pro-democracy protesters last month and Premier Li Peng promised that Chinese 
students abroad who participated in protest rallies will be welcomed back to 
China and not punished. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang and Li were speaking at the end of a six-day conference of 151 
ambassadors and other diplomats who were called back to Beijing to discuss 
Chinese foreign policy in the wake of political turmoil at home. 
</P>
<P>
Many Western nations are allowing Chinese students to extend their stays 
because of fears they face persecution if they return to China. More than 2,000 
people have been reported arrested for joining protests. 
</P>
<P>
"Because they were far from the motherland and influenced by the Western media, 
they didn't understand the true situation and participated in protests and said 
some extremist words," Premier Li was quoted as saying about students living 
abroad.

BUSH TO DISPATCH 60 PEACE CORPS AIDES TO WORK IN HUNGARY

In what was called a "historic day" for the Peace Corps, President Bush said 
today the agency will send 60 American volunteers to Hungary as English 
teachers -- the first time volunteers are 
</P>
<P>
being assigned to a Communist nation. 
</P>
<P>
It also will be the first time that volunteers are sent to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"The teaching of English is one of the most popular American exports," Bush 
said, adding that the program will help "open the global market to more 
Hungarians." 
</P>
<P>
Bush, declaring that "the Iron Curtain has begun to part," also promised today 
to give Hungary unlimited access to American markets. And Bush, warmly 
applauded by his audience at Karl Marx University, also offered a $25-million 
grant to spur this reform-minded East Bloc nation's fledgling free-enterprise 
system. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Threshold of a New Era' 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Paul Coverdell, director of the Peace Corps, said, "This is a 
historic day and the threshold of a new era for the U.S. Peace Corps." 
</P>
<P>
He said the program will involve about 60 American volunteers teaching English 
throughout Hungary. The training of the American volunteers -- including 
language proficiency in Hungarian -- will begin this year and the contingent 
will be sent to Hungary early next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The United States announced plans this spring to send Peace Corps volunteers to 
China, but Chinese officials have delayed the program in the wake of student 
unrest. 
</P>
<P>
Saluting political and economic reforms in Hungary, Bush said there is "no 
mistaking the fact that Hungary is at the threshold of great and historic 
change." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's speech, broadcast live on Hungarian television, followed talks with 
Hungarian leaders who gave him a plaque containing barbed wire from the fence 
recently dismantled along the Austrian border. 
</P>
<P>
That barrier had stood as "the ugly symbol of Europe's division and Hungary's 
isolation," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Iron Curtain Parts 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, the Iron Curtain has begun to part, and Hungary -- your 
great country -- is leading the way," Bush said, standing against a backdrop of 
huge Hungarian and American flags. 
</P>
<P>
In promising to eliminate trade barriers against Hungary, Bush said he planned 
to grant this country a permanent status as most favored nation, accorded to 
America's trade friends. The only requirement is for Hungary to formally enact 
its new emigration law, removing all obstacles to emigration. 
</P>
<P>
It is expected to be passed by the end of the year, making Hungary the first 
Warsaw Pact country deemed in full compliance with the Jackson-Vanik law 
imposing trade barriers in retaliation for emigration restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said the $25-million grant that he will seek from Congress will be used to 
create an enterprise fund to help Hungary expand its private sector, which, 
although small, is the most extensive in Eastern Europe.

High infant mortality and dropout rates among blacks are problems all America 
must work to overcome, Vice President Dan Quayle told the NAACP convention 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle spoke on the fourth day of the National Assn. for the Advancement of 
Colored People's annual convention in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
"If President George Bush were in the country, you know he would be speaking to 
you," Quayle said. Bush is in Hungary today as part of his tour of Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle, who received a good reception from the NAACP's leadership, said the 
Bush Administration is committed to promoting civil rights and the President 
has met several times with civil rights leaders. 
</P>
<P>
He reviewed the history of the civil rights movement, and said, "Today, there 
is less bigotry than before, but there is still bigotry -- and bigots." 
</P>
<P>
Quayle cited statistics indicating the social and economic disadvantage of 
blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"Let us not forget that the black infant mortality rate is twice as high as for 
whites," said Quayle, who also spoke of the disproportionately high dropout 
rate among young blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"These are not just black problems, these are America's problems," Quayle said.

Leningrad regional Communist Party boss Yuri Solovev, who was turned down for a 
seat in Parliament by voters in March, was fired today during a visit by 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to the nation's second largest city. 
</P>
<P>
Solovev, who is also a junior member of the ruling Politburo in Moscow, was the 
highest Communist Party member scorned by Leningrad voters, who refused to 
elect at least five top party bosses of the city and the region in March 26 
parliamentary polls. 
</P>
<P>
The action came a day after Gorbachev flew to Leningrad to look into the 
"complex of questions" raised by the party's election defeat. 
</P>
<P>
"A plenum of the Leningrad region on Wednesday relieved Yuri Solovev of the 
duties of first secretary and dismissed him from membership in Leningrad 
regional politburo in connection with his request to go on pension," the 
official Soviet press agency Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear whether Solovev would lose his job in the 
Politburo as well. He was appointed Leningrad party chief in July, 1985, four 
months after Gorbachev came to power, and joined the Politburo in March, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Only the Central Committee of the Communist Party can strip him of his 
Politburo seat. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said that B. V. Gidaspov was chosen to replace Solovev to head the 
regional party apparatus in Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
"Gorbachev spoke at the plenum," Tass said, indicating that he watched the 
dismissal of Solovev, who had criticized Gorbachev's reforms even after his 
election loss four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Solovev, 64, ran unopposed for the Parliament known as the Congress of People's 
Deputies, but more than 50% of the voters just crossed his name out, 
invalidating him as a candidate.

SOVIET PSYCHIATRIC ABUSES HAVE BEEN CUT, TEAM SAYS

American experts who inspected Soviet psychiatric hospitals said today that 
previous wide-scale abuses have been reduced, but mental institutions are still 
being used by some Soviet authorities to punish political dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
The 26-member American team was led by Robert Farrand, deputy assistant 
secretary of state for human rights, and Loren Roth, professor of psychiatry at 
the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The American team included 14 psychiatrists, one psychologist, two lawyers, two 
specialists in human rights and six interpreters. 
</P>
<P>
They were allowed to visit a series of Soviet psychiatric hospitals from Feb. 
26 to March 12, interviewing 15 patients and 12 former patients who had 
recently been released by Soviet authorities. Of the 12 who had been released, 
the American team found that 11 had been confined for reasons that were 
essentially political, including the distribution of literature banned by 
Soviet authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The American team concluded: "There are some signs of movement to bring legal 
and psychiatric practices closer to those found in the West. Yet, there are 
also many signs that the transition is far from complete." 
</P>
<P>
Among the abuses the American team found was the use of antipsychotic 
medications to treat patients who were thought to have "delusions of reformism" 
or "anti-Soviet thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
One drug, called sulfazine, which causes severe pain, fever and loss of 
muscular control, was used "for punitive rather than therapeutic purposes," the 
American team reported. 
</P>
<P>
A Soviet response to the U.S. report said the government is writing guidelines 
to restrict the use of such drugs. 
</P>
<P>
The response conceded that some shortcomings in mental institutions may still 
exist, but suggested that the American team erred by accepting, at face-value, 
statements made by every Soviet mental patient who was interviewed.

PAPER PAYS $2.77 MILLION FOR LIBEL

<P>
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette has paid a $2.77-million libel judgment to a lawyer 
who was the subject of a 1979 story over a will he prepared. 
</P>
<P>
It was the largest libel judgment ever paid by a newspaper and the 
second-largest judgment upheld by U.S. courts, according to the Post-Gazette. 
The largest was a $3-million libel award last year against CBS News. 
</P>
<P>
But the newspaper's editor, John G. Craig Jr., said today that he believes the 
libel decision is "a particular Pennsylvania problem" and will not have 
nationwide repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
A Westmoreland County jury ruled in 1985 that the newspaper libeled Richard 
DiSalle, a former state and appellate judge. At issue was a Sept. 10, 1979, 
article about the disputed will of millionaire Paul Ciaffoni. The article 
contained allegations made in court documents by some relatives that the will 
was fraudulently altered and that DiSalle had a close relationship with the 
co-executor, Ciaffoni's youngest daughter. 
</P>
<P>
The judge instructed the jury that under state libel law, publications about 
judicial proceedings are immune from legal responsibility even if they contain 
information that defames an individual. The judge said, however, that 
newspapers give up that immunity if an article is not a fair summary of those 
court proceedings.

DOW ADVANCES 18.02 TO A NEW POST-CRASH HIGH

Wall Street's blue chip Dow index advanced to a new post-crash high today as 
investors carried the stock market's rally through a seventh consecutive 
session. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 18.02 points at 2,532.63, bringing 
its gain since the start of last week to about 92 points. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing shares outnumbered declines 4 to 3 in moderate New York Stock 
Exchange volume of 160.55 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
The market, which has advanced on expectations of falling interest rates and 
renewed takeover speculation, faltered earlier in the day. Traders said 
investors were growing cautious ahead of a spate of June economic reports due 
Friday that could contain some unpleasant surprises. 
</P>
<P>
But futures-related program trading kicked in late in the session to push the 
Dow index to a new post-crash closing high, past the June 23 finish of 
2,531.87. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bond Prices Flat 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices were unchanged to slightly lower in dull early trading today. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was down 5/32 point, or about $1.50 per 
$1,000 face amount, around midday. Its yield, which moves in the opposite 
direction from its price, held steady at 8.03% from late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said trading was extremely light in the absence of economic news to 
move the credit markets. 
</P>
<P>
William Sullivan, director of money market research for Dean Witter Reynolds 
Inc., said a Treasury auction later today on the seven-year note contributed to 
the decline. 
</P>
<P>
"I think basically dealers are beginning to soften prices up slightly in an 
attempt to garner some interest in the auction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The auction of $7.25 billion in notes is designed to raise $2.8 billion in cash 
for the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
A slightly lower dollar this morning also was lending a weak tone to the 
market, but wasn't a significant factor, Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were unchanged, intermediate maturities were down 1/32 point to 5/32 point and 
long-term issues fell from 1/8 point to 7/32 point, according to Telerate Inc., 
the financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond 
with a $1,000 face value. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, fell 0.98 to 1,192.00. 
</P>
<P>
In corporate trading, industrials were lower. Moody's investment grade 
corporate bond index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 0.22 to 329.63. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.98% as the discount lost 1 basis 
point to 7.73%. Yields on six-month bills were down to 7.83% as the discount 
fell 4 basis points to 7.44%. Yields on one-year bills dropped to 7.81% as the 
discount fell 4 basis points to 7.29%.

A Japanese beverage maker will stop using a trademark portraying a top-hatted, 
thick-lipped black man sipping a drink through a straw because some customers 
find it racist, the company announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Nobuaki Hashimoto, spokesman of Calpis Food Industry Co., said the company will 
discontinue the 65-year-old trademark by the end of the year. The logo appears 
on labels of the company's top-selling soft drinks and on advertising 
billboards across the country. 
</P>
<P>
"In an age of internationalization, we cannot continue to use the trademark if 
it gives unpleasant feelings to consumers," Hashimoto said. 
</P>
<P>
Calpis Food Industry began reconsidering the use of its logo in February 
because of increased interest in the issue of racial discrimination in Japan. 
In January, Japanese publishers stopped selling "Little Black Sambo," one of 
the most popular children's books in Japan, because of the racist connotations 
the book carried.

Quarterback Bernie Kosar has agreed to a six-year extension of his contract, 
the Cleveland Browns said today. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Other NFL quarterbacks of similar status 
include John Elway and Warren Moon, who have contracts worth more than $2 
million a season. Rookie Troy Aikman of UCLA signed with the Dallas Cowboys for 
about $11.6 million over six years. 
</P>
<P>
The new deal means that Kosar will be with the Browns for seven more seasons, 
because he has one year remaining on the five-year contract worth more than $5 
million he signed as a rookie out of the University of Miami in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Kosar, 25, guided the Browns to the American Football Conference championship 
games in the 1986 and 1987 seasons.

It was a round Derek Nannen of Geneva won't forget, with two aces and an eagle 
in a six-hole span in the first round of the Nebraska State Junior 
Championships at York Country Club on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Nannen, 16, shot his first hole-in-one on the 153-yard No. 11, a par 3. On the 
next hole, a 497-yard par 5, Nannen carded an eagle 3 when he holed his third 
shot at a distance he said was about 80 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Somehow I just knew I was going to make that shot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nannen recorded his second ace on the par 3, 135-yard No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
The Geneva golfer used his two aces to record an even-par 70 for the first 18 
holes of the tournament. He was seventh in Class A at the end of the two rounds 
Tuesday, posting a 70-79 -- 149. 
</P>
<P>
"It was too bad I couldn't keep it up on the second 18," Nannen said. "I didn't 
hit my irons on the second 18 nearly as well as I was on the front 18."
