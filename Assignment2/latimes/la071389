EXXON VALDEZ STILL ADRIFT ON TROUBLED SEAS 
</P>

<P>
The Exxon Valdez is facing mounting barriers to its entry into San Diego Bay 
for repairs, including the likelihood of another oil spill and increasing 
involvement by state and federal agencies, officials indicated Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard has ordered the Valdez to hold its position about 50 miles off 
the San Diego coast until the ship has stopped discharging an oily substance 
blamed for an 18-mile slick that was sighted Monday within a mile of the 
tanker. 
</P>
<P>
Only after the discharge has stopped and a 24-hour waiting period has elapsed 
will the Coast Guard allow the Valdez to enter shallower waters, probably near 
San Clemente Island, to remove five steel plates jutting from the ship's 
bottom. Those plates have to be removed before the ship can clear the bottom of 
San Diego Bay to reach dry dock. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon officials remained confident Wednesday that the Valdez, the tanker 
responsible for dumping 11 million gallons of oil off Alaska, will be able to 
enter San Diego Bay. But Coast Guard officials speculated that the logistics of 
stopping the leaks and cutting off the plates could delay entry for several 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Wednesday, Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi 
said, "I understand that people feel we failed on our pledge. But, I want to 
tell you, that pledge still stands. We will not come into the bay until we are 
certain" the Valdez has stopped discharging materials. 
</P>
<P>
"Under no circumstances are we going to endanger the environment," Iarossi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials also said Wednesday that they expect at least one more 
spill from the Valdez after the plates, about 40 feet long and 65 feet wide, 
are removed and the ship moves out to sea for a final deballasting of the sea 
water in its tanks. 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty of when and whether the discharge can be stopped and the 
likelihood of another spill have increased the reluctance of state and federal 
officials to allow the ship to enter state waters near San Clemente Island for 
removal of the plates. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy, which has jurisdiction over the island and uses it for target 
practice, has given preliminary approval to the repair at that site, Coast 
Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we have a problem with the plates (being dropped into the bay). 
Exxon could always pick them up later," said John Grant, a biologist with the 
California Department of Fish and Game. "But (the department) has said that, if 
the ship keeps leaking oil, they won't let it in state waters." 
</P>
<P>
State jurisdiction extends to waters 3 miles from shore. 
</P>
<P>
High-ranking officials of the Coast Guard and state fish and game department, 
which have the main voice in allowing the Valdez near San Clemente Island and 
into the bay, said the ship will have to stay away from both places until they 
are satisfied that the tanker won't leak any more oil. 
</P>
<P>
The state Lands Commission has joined the Coast Guard and other agencies in 
investigating the Valdez matter, and California Gov. George Deukmejian, Lt. 
Gov. Leo McCarthy and Controller Gray Davis, among other politicians, have 
expressed concern over the tanker. 
</P>
<P>
State fish-and-game director Pete Bontadelli arrived in San Diego Wednesday 
afternoon to observe the Valdez and was to brief reporters today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vessel Holding Position 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, we would not want to see the Valdez harbored in San Diego if it's 
going to mean that it's going to create some kind of water pollution," 
Deukmejian said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday afternoon, the small sheen trailing the crippled Valdez had all 
but dissipated, and the larger slick believed to have come from the ship had 
shrunk to a 1-mile-long, 500 yard-wide patch. However, two smaller sheens were 
sighted near the tanker's bow, the Coast Guard reported, and discharged goop 
occasionally has bubbled out from beneath the Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Cmdr. Frank Scarborough said Exxon reported Tuesday that a similar 
bubbling from beneath the Valdez's hull had been sighted twice, momentarily, 
during the transit to San Diego. That contradicted Exxon's earlier reports that 
the problems were not discovered until Monday morning during the final 
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
The ship, holding its position about 50 miles off San Diego, was being towed at 
about 1 knot westward from San Diego, and the government of Mexico has 
expressed concern about the tanker drifting toward its waters. 
</P>
<P>
An 82-foot Coast Guard cutter has been stationed near the Valdez, and 
helicopters have been flying out during the day to observe the discharge, Coast 
Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The crippled Valdez arrived off the coast late Sunday from Alaska, and was 
expected to dock Tuesday morning at the National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co. 
in San Diego Bay for a $25 million, nine-month repair job. 
</P>
<P>
A final inspection by the Coast Guard and other agencies revealed what appeared 
to be oil coming out of the ship and the presence of the five steel plates 
jutting downward from the tanker's hull. The plates, surrounding the damaged 
areas of the Valdez hull, apparently were peeled back when the tanker moved 
through turbulent seas on the 2,200-mile trip to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
On March 24, the giant tanker hit a reef in Alaska and spilled millions of 
gallons of oil, fouling hundreds of miles of pristine Alaskan shoreline, 
killing thousands of animals and upsetting the fishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard officials said Wednesday that the slick and the sheen patches 
trailing the boat may have come from hard, dry oil residue in two of the ship's 
damaged tanks not cleaned out before the ship left Alaska. The wax may have 
unexpectedly fallen off the tank walls as it entered the warmer waters off 
Southern California, said Cmdr. Scarborough. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Logical Explanation' 
</P>
<P>
Scarborough said the Valdez has been lowered about 38 feet into the water to 
try to stop the discharge. 
</P>
<P>
"No one foresaw the effect of coming down here in a warmer environment that 
would remove that substance from the sides of the tank," he said. "This strikes 
us as the logical explanation and the one that makes sense scientifically. It 
would explain why the folks in Alaska thought they had a clean ship when it 
sailed and a dirty ship when it got here." 
</P>
<P>
Iarossi said that Exxon, the Coast Guard and other agencies that inspected and 
approved the ship for the transit to San Diego knew the wax residue was in the 
tanks. Cleaning machinery used on the ship apparently could not reach the 
farthest depths of the tanks, and divers were unable to physically loosen the 
material. 
</P>
<P>
But he rejected the Coast Guard's explanation of why the residue was coming 
loose. He said the wax could have been scrubbed off the tank walls by water 
that surged in the ship's hull when the Valdez was raised to approach San 
Diego. The raising of the ship exposed the lower depths of the tank to 
turbulent waves, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Iarossi, pressed Wednesday morning by reporters, at first maintained that he 
didn't know whether the wax residue was oil, saying only that the substance, 
perhaps algae, had a "hydrocarbon content" that was nontoxic. 
</P>
<P>
Later, however, he said he thought the material was aged oil that had lost its 
toxicity. "You know hydrocarbon is oil, but I wanted to avoid the impression 
that the ship is covered with oil, because that is not the case," Iarossi said. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental groups continued to question the presence of what appeared to be 
oil in a tanker that had been reported to be clean. 
</P>
<P>
"This sounds like a theory of immaculate conception. It's the oil that came 
from nowhere. Exxon should admit their fallibility, admit their mistakes, and 
stop covering up," said Rick Nadeau, executive director of Greenpeace Action in 
San Diego. "We have to be skeptical of Exxon's assurances, at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Other Greenpeace leaders called for more public input and a more stringent 
review before the tanker is allowed to dock. 
</P>
<P>
"The best place for it is still in dry dock, but we have to be sure it doesn't 
cause increased damage on its way in," said Kelly Quirke, Greenpeace's ocean 
ecology coordinator, who traveled to San Diego from the Bay Area. "That's what 
a public review process could be used for."

POLICE TO GIVE INS ALIENS ARRESTED ON MISDEMEANORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police will turn over undocumented immigrants arrested on misdemeanor 
charges to the U. S. Border Patrol for return to their home countries and 
possible federal prosecution under a new policy unveiled Wednesday by Police 
Chief Bob Burgreen. 
</P>
<P>
The new procedures, details of which are under study by the Police Department 
and the city's Citizens' Advisory Board on Police Community Relations, are 
aimed at perhaps "thousands" of undocumented arrestees who are cited for 
misdemeanors and released to the streets because there is no space for them in 
county jails, Burgreen said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
"We see this as a real deterrent to aliens who are coming into our country 
simply to rip us off," Burgreen said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assistance From Agents 
</P>
<P>
The policy change will bring Border Patrol agents into police headquarters to 
aid in the identification of undocumented immigrants after initial screening by 
arresting officers and the police lieutenant in charge of a shift. If the 
Border Patrol agent determines that a person scheduled for release is 
undocumented, agents would take him into custody for return to his home country 
or deportation, Border Patrol spokesman Mike Gregg said. 
</P>
<P>
An undocumented person arrested by police a second time who has previously been 
deported could face felony charges of illegal entry into the United States, 
Gregg said. The crime is punishable by a year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
The new policy, proposed to the Citizens Advisory Board on Wednesday, received 
cautious support from some Latino activists and City Councilman Bob Filner, 
whose district covers the city's border region. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Reasonable Policy' 
</P>
<P>
Filner believes the plan "is a reasonable policy for the city to pursue," said 
Allen Jones, a Filner aide. "If people are committing crimes, it makes no 
difference what their country of origin is." 
</P>
<P>
Roberto Martinez, co-chairman of the Coalition for Law and Justice, a Latino 
advocacy group, said that "we know there is a problem with certain numbers of 
undocumented people coming into this town who are involved in illegal activity, 
criminal activity. We can't ignore that." 
</P>
<P>
Martinez, who was briefed by Burgreen on the new proposal last week, said that 
"on the surface we don't have a problem" with the new plan. He said, however, 
that there must be safeguards against arbitrary application of the policy 
against undocumented immigrants not accused of crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Martinez added that his organization is still studying details of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Opposition Voiced 
</P>
<P>
But Herman Baca, chairperson of the Committee on Chicano Rights, said, "I think 
(the policy) is going to be used as an excuse to harass and violate the rights 
of any person of Mexican-American ancestry in the Chicano community." 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen, who said he is still taking advice from city officials and Latino 
groups on details of the policy, promised that the policy will not be used as a 
pretext for rounding up undocumented immigrants who have not committed crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"My direction will be that no games are to be played," Burgreen said. 
</P>
<P>
Since August, 1986, the Police Department has declined to aid the Border Patrol 
by detaining undocumented immigrants who are not charged with crimes. That 
policy will not change under the new procedures. (A number of other county law 
enforcement agencies, including the San Diego County Sheriff's Department, do 
hold suspected undocumented immigrants for the Border Patrol). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Be Handed Over 
</P>
<P>
However, undocumented immigrants accused of crimes such as assault and battery, 
trespass, carrying a concealed weapon or breaking into an automobile will be 
turned over to the Border Patrol when the policy takes effect, which hasn't 
been decided. 
</P>
<P>
American citizens arrested for the same crimes still will be cited and released 
in most cases. The difference, Burgreen said, is that police keep addresses of 
those people and are able to locate them if they fail to appear in court. 
Undocumented immigrants are often impossible to find, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The county's packed jails cause police to release more than 100 arrestees 
daily, some of them for crimes involving violence and drug possession. 
</P>
<P>
No records are kept on how many misdemeanor arrestees are undocumented, 
according to Kimberly Glenn, supervising administrative analyst in the Police 
Department's crime analysis division. However, Burgreen estimated that perhaps 
thousands of people, many of them repeat offenders, would be affected by the 
new rules. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Same People Over and Over 
</P>
<P>
"We are seeing the same people over and over," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Burgreen said he will take into account the advice of activists, city officials 
and the Citizens Advisory Board about details of implementing the new policy 
but intends to institute "either this policy or something similar to it." He 
has the authority to adopt the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Skorepa, chairman of the Citizens Advisory Board, said a subcommittee of 
that panel will review the policy proposal and report back with recommendations 
next month.

In a poll of seniors published by the student newspaper at Banning High in 
Wilmington, the winner of "Best School Activity" for the year, was . . . 
</P>
<P>
The teachers' strike. 
</P>
<P>
Finishing second to the two-week labor dispute in the poll was a much shorter 
event -- Senior Ditch Day. 
</P>
<P>
The tension was thick on KPWR-FM radio the other morning when Dodger manager 
Tommy Lasorda launched into a discussion on disc jockey Jay Thomas' show of how 
he'd lost 36 pounds on the Ultra-Slim Fast diet. 
</P>
<P>
Like an umpire, Thomas had to cut off Lasorda with the explanation that his 
station sponsors the Nutri-Systems diet. 
</P>
<P>
It was a moment that was nearly as awkward as when All-Star game announcer 
Ronald Reagan remarked that Anaheim Stadium, home of the California Angels, is 
"the greatest baseball stadium in America." After a few moments of silence, Vin 
Scully, the long-time Dodger announcer, diplomatically resumed calling 
play-by-play of the All-Star action. 
</P>
<P>
Zsa Zsa Gabor, star of matrimony, talk shows and salons, appeared at the 
Beverly Hills courthouse Wednesday morning with Husband No. 8 to plead innocent 
to a misdemeanor charge of slapping a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
Gabor, whose Rolls-Royce had been pulled over because her license tags were 
allegedly expired, repeated her contention that the officer used "abusive 
language and excessive force." 
</P>
<P>
A former Miss Hungary of 1936 -- evidently she was around 13 when she won the 
crown because she lists her current age as 66 -- denied that she was seeking 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
"My dear boy," she told one reporter, "I don't need any help." 
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with The Times beforehand, Gabor's attorney, William 
T. Graysen, said: "Make sure you spell my name right. G-r-a-y-s-e-n." 
</P>
<P>
It just hasn't been Harold Ezell's week. 
</P>
<P>
Not only was he was forced out as western regional commissioner of the INS, but 
while he was conducting an interview with KABC radio's Michael Jackson on his 
car phone, he disappeared from the air. "Suddenly you could hear some other 
driver's conversation," reports Barbara Rosenstein of West Los Angeles, who was 
listening to the show. "Michael Jackson sounded like he was trying to keep from 
laughing." 
</P>
<P>
Then, on the KNBC-TV (Channel 4) news, while anchorwoman Colleen Williams was 
reporting Ezell's ouster, the picture on the screen showed the Air Force's 
stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
Even his critics would never have accused the talkative Ezell of being 
stealthy. 
</P>
<P>
A male shopper, apparently struck by a memory lapse, brought his cart to a halt 
in the cleaning-goods section of a Ralphs market in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
No problem. He took his cellular phone out of the cart, dialed home and was 
overheard asking: 
</P>
<P>
"Now which liquid detergent was I supposed to get?"

AL MARTINEZ: THE MAN STOLE TWO HENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If Thomas Jefferson had written "when, in the course of human events, it 
becomes necessary to amend existing section 12.24 B and 19.00 to establish 
criteria based on public health, safety and welfare, including consideration of 
negative impact reports CF 84-1021-S3 . . .," we would still be saluting the 
Union Jack. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he laid out in simple terms those elements of history and human need 
that are the keystones of American freedom, and the document known as the 
Declaration of Independence led to creation of the United States of America. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, life was simpler then. All the colonists had to do was break ties with 
England, establish a new nation, fight a war and create a basis for human 
dignity that would light the world. Nothing to get excited about. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles City Council, on the other hand, must deal with zoning changes, 
driveway improvements, retirement picnics and the partial funding of an 
analyst/writer for the alcohol abuse program. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings me, however circuitously, to Gloria Molina's brave efforts to make 
the language of government so clear than even the government can understand it. 
</P>
<P>
Molina, who joined the council a scant two years ago, has been at war with 
bureaucratic gibberish since the day she took office. 
</P>
<P>
Just last month she demanded once more that official documents, including the 
council agenda, be reduced to simple declarative sentences whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
What really got to her was a toxic waste issue brought before the council by 
the City Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
It called for "amending Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 12.24B1 (u) and (v) 
and existing ordinance (No. 163620) to waive time limits to process conditional 
use permits, to include the authority for an ad hoc committee per Section 
25199.7 . . ." and so on. You get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Molina, bless her innocent heart, challenged her colleagues to explain what 
they were about to vote on. None of them could. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by this inability to understand an issue of environmental importance 
in a city drowning in pollution, Molina announced that she was considering an 
ordinance that would require all city departments to put their requests in 
simple language. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, the irony. Such an ordinance, she was told, already existed, but was 
generally ignored because no one understood it in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"It's crazy," she said to me the other day. "If I can't understand departmental 
reports I'm supposed to vote on, how can I tell my constituents what they 
mean?" 
</P>
<P>
I sympathize with Molina. 
</P>
<P>
Bureaucrats complicate simple messages to justify their own existence and to 
confuse the meaning of the measures they propose, thereby making it easier to 
zing them past our bewildered legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Molina makes the point that those who simplify best are journalists. That's 
because, to begin with, we are simple people grasping to understand our world, 
and because we train to some degree to hone an ability to communicate. 
</P>
<P>
We are not expected to make poetry, but we are expected to be able to write 
"The man stole two hens" in terms that would make a copy editor feel good 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
Molina believes that what the city needs is the governmental equivalent of a 
copy editor to ride herd on those who submit reports to the council. If the 
report isn't clear, the copy editor, or monitor in this case, would kick it 
back for a rewrite. 
</P>
<P>
Not a bad idea. To begin with, there are no intellectual requirements to 
becoming a member of a city council in America. A simple ability to read and 
write will do. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, many are elected who can barely understand the fundamentals of a 
complete sentence, much less follow the convoluted syntax of an environmental 
engineering report. 
</P>
<P>
It's like trying to explain the concept of infinity to a monkey. 
</P>
<P>
Clarifying the language for our City Council might ultimately work to 
everyone's benefit, although one barrier to civic improvement remains. Once 
they understand the issues they are about to vote on, will they really care 
enough to think about them? 
</P>
<P>
Tom Jefferson did, and his concepts altered human history. No one expects our 
City Council to change much of anything, but I'd be happy if they knew the man 
stole two hens and wondered, however vaguely, what they ought to do about it.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CARLSBAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three Carlsbad High School students testified Wednesday that they purchased 
anabolic steroids from a teacher's aide during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
After a preliminary hearing, Gregory Thomas Tirona, 31, was bound over to 
Superior Court to stand trial on six charges of administering or selling 
steroids. 
</P>
<P>
The three minors all testified that they bought steroids from Tirona, also a 
part-time coach, during late October and early November of last year. All three 
said they paid $25 a bottle for the illegal substance, which they said they 
purchased during school hours in front of Tirona's classroom. 
</P>
<P>
In deciding that Tirona should face trial, San Diego Municipal Judge Fredric 
Link said the evidence presented offered "more than a strong suspicion" that 
Tirona sold the illegal drug to minors. 
</P>
<P>
An arraignment and trial setting was scheduled for July 26. 
</P>
<P>
Tirona, a Carlsbad resident, remains free on his own recognizance.

ENCINA SEWAGE PLANT TO PUT A LID ON ODOR PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Carlsbad residents downwind from the Encina sewage plant will have to hold 
their noses a while longer while workers hustle to solve the odor problem, but 
they shouldn't have to worry about the quality of the ocean water during the 
summer sunbathing months. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-member Joint Advisory Committee of the Encina Water Pollution Control 
Facility voted Wednesday to move as fast as possible to cover the stench that 
has been affecting nearby residents since the plant increased its treatment of 
the sewage to the secondary level last October. At the same time, the committee 
members unanimously rejected the idea of reverting to advanced primary 
treatment to lessen the smell, to the great relief of local environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Happy With Decision 
</P>
<P>
"We're elated that the board has decided to do the right thing here," said 
Richard MacManus, spokesman for People for a Clean Ocean. "We have empathy for 
the local residents that have to deal with the odor issue, and hopefully there 
will be a quick solution to that problem, but you can't jeopardize the public 
health. 
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, the days of lower sewage treatment are gone forever." 
</P>
<P>
People for a Clean Ocean lobbied extensively for a switch to secondary 
treatment, which more effectively removes toxins, bacteria and viruses from the 
effluent before it is dumped from the plant's ocean outfall 1 1/2 miles 
offshore. But, when the new system was kicked into gear last fall, it soon 
became obvious that more intensive treatment resulted in a more intense smell. 
</P>
<P>
A recently completed study, done jointly by the John Carollo engineering firm 
and TRC Environmental Consultants, concluded that most of the odor was coming 
from the plant's uncovered aeration basins, where the sewage settles, and from 
the channels running between the basins. 
</P>
<P>
Engineer Dennis Wood told the committee Wednesday that simply covering the open 
basins and channels would virtually wipe out the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The study's recommendations, which were unanimously approved by the committee, 
called for the the basins and channels to be covered as soon as possible with 
plywood. The makeshift plywood covers will be replaced with interim covers 
designed to last about three years -- which could be in place before the end of 
1989, "with a little bit of hard work and a lot of luck," Encina General 
Manager Rick Graff said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Permanent Covers Are Goal 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the facility will seek a contract to build permanent fiberglass or 
aluminum basin covers, which could be removed for occasional maintenance. If 
work proceeds quickly, the permanent covers could be in place by July, 1990, 
the study said. 
</P>
<P>
The committee also explored the possibility of reverting to less-intensive 
treatment until the end of the year to mitigate the smell, but Graff 
recommended against it. 
</P>
<P>
Such a switch would have negligible financial benefits and could actually cause 
more odor because of the complexities of switching systems, Graff said. 
Furthermore, the plant would have to go back to secondary treatment in November 
or December, when the federal Environmental Protection Agency issues its new 
five-year license, which will provide for secondary treatment only. 
</P>
<P>
After hearing the presentation, the entire board seemed to agree with the 
remarks of Carlsbad Councilman Eric Larson, who said that reverting to advanced 
primary treatment is "not even a viable alternative."

OPPOSITION WINS MOST SEATS IN BAJA VOTE UPSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The opposition National Action Party has won a plurality in the next Baja 
California state legislature, Mexican political parties said Wednesday, as the 
counting of ballots in the governor's race proceeded at a tortuous pace. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Jesus del Palacio la Fontaine, the candidate of National Action, 
known as the PAN, won the mayor's race in Ensenada. PAN had been widely 
expected to win that post. 
</P>
<P>
The PAN has been battling with the long-dominant Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, or PRI, over control of the state body as a result of the July 2 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 15 elected state government seats, the PAN won eight and the PRI 
garnered seven. Results from two Mexicali districts were made official 
Wednesday, and the two parties split them. 
</P>
<P>
Four other seats are apportioned to minority parties, meaning neither the PAN 
nor the PRI will have a true majority when the new legislature convenes Oct. 1. 
Both the PAN and the PRI are likely to seek alliances with the smaller parties 
to pass their programs. 
</P>
<P>
The PAN, citing alleged irregularities in the count, said it planned to contest 
the PRI victory in the 3rd District of Mexicali before the state Electoral 
College, which is now likely to be dominated by PAN members. 
</P>
<P>
The PAN has vowed to enact sweeping electoral reforms to make opposition 
victories easier in the future. 
</P>
<P>
The new legislature will mark the first time in the history of Baja California, 
and possibly in national history, that the PRI does not control a state 
governing body. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the PRI have already conceded that the PAN's gubernatorial 
candidate, Ernesto Ruffo Appel, is the likely winner of the governor's race. 
However, counting of the gubernatorial ballots has been very deliberate, 
sparking charges that the ruling party is attempting to alter the official 
results. 
</P>
<P>
The nominally independent State Electoral Commission, which oversees the 
counting process, has stated that the slow pace of the count was caused by the 
many challenges by all parties. The PAN has charged that the commission is 
manipulated by the PRI leaders -- a charge denied by the commission and PRI 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Results of the governor's race are expected to be released sometime before 
Sunday, when the state's new governor is scheduled to be officially recognized 
as the winner. The new chief executive takes office Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The PAN won all six legislative slots from Tijuana, and elected the city's 
first opposition mayor. The PRI won the mayor's races in Mexicali, the state 
capital, and in Tecate.

POLICE USE TIPS IN HUNT FOR DRIVER WHO KILLED OVER TRAFFIC ARGUMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Homicide investigators followed up on public tips Wednesday on cars matching 
the description of the one used by the killer of a La Jolla teen-ager shot in a 
traffic dispute, 
</P>
<P>
Homicide Sgt. Ed Petrick said he and four other detectives were checking with 
car dealerships and private owners in search of a late model, red Isuzu 
Trooper. 
</P>
<P>
Kurt Yokes, 15, of the 5400 block of Bahia Lane was shot once in the chest 
Monday by a driver angered by a near-accident with the car in which Yokes was a 
passenger. He was dead on arrival at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Yokes, a freshman at Mission Bay High School and a newspaper carrier, and two 
older friends were driving home when the Isuzu nearly crashed into them at 
Grand Avenue and Bayard Street in Pacific Beach, police said. After an exchange 
of gestures, a friend of Yokes said to the driver of the Isuzu, "I've seen 
better driving on golf courses," according to Petrick. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assailant Was Stranger 
</P>
<P>
"That was the only thing said, and the other guy did not say a word," Petrick 
said, adding that neither Yokes nor his friends had ever met the man. 
</P>
<P>
Yokes' friends told police that the killer did not reply and followed their car 
to a home in the 2600 block of Christopher Street. When Yokes and a friend left 
their car to find out why the man had followed them, the killer fired the fatal 
shot, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Two friends with Yokes in the vehicle, the 18-year-old woman driver and a 
19-year-old man, were not identified for safety reasons. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect is described as a slender Asian man with black hair that reaches 
shoulder length in the back but is short in front. Police said he wore a white, 
button-down shirt and a black tie, leading them to suspect he may have been a 
customer or an employee of one of the many nightclubs in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The Isuzu was dirty and also carried a roof rack. It has not been reported 
stolen, according to the police. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody knows who this person is," Petrick said. "They may not know it yet, 
but someone should be able to help us."

TIME TO GET YOUR NICKEL'S WORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's summertime, when millions of Californians constantly reach for a cold one. 
Empty beer and soda containers really pile up this time of year, often on 
beaches and in parks as litter and trash even though they can be recycled for a 
penny each. So this is also the time of year when it is pretty obvious that a 
penny is not enough. 
</P>
<P>
A bill, sponsored by Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), would raise the state 
redemption rate on bottles or cans under 24 ounces to two empties for a nickel. 
The bounty on larger bottles, particularly the popular two-liter size, would 
rise from a penny to a nickel. The nickels would provide stronger incentives to 
recycle. 
</P>
<P>
The measure, SB 1221, would boost the refunds again to a nickel per smaller 
container and a dime per larger bottle as of Jan. 1, 1993, but only if the 
redemption rates do not reach 65% for metal, glass or plastic containers. That 
level, set by the original bottle legislation two years ago, is more than 
reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
State recycling rates, however, have not come close to that goal. California's 
redemption levels were reported at 57% for empty aluminum cans, 33% for glass 
bottles and a dismal 5% for plastic containers six months ago. A new report on 
recycling rates is due soon; it would be nice to see the rate closer to the 90% 
rate that states achieve dealing in nickels and dimes instead of pennies. 
</P>
<P>
Californians drink 12 billion beers and soft drinks a year. Recycling the 
containers would relieve municipal landfills, reduce litter, save on energy and 
reward consumers. That is clearly a nickel's worth.

A CHAMPION FOR THE KURDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For two years, largely unobserved by outsiders, the government of Iraq has been 
uprooting and forcibly resettling much of its Kurdish minority. So far, 
American officials say, as many as 500,000 Kurds -- more than one-fifth of the 
Kurdish population -- have been moved from their ancient towns and villages 
along the country's northeastern border with Iran. President Saddam Hussein's 
regime has tried to give the relocations a humane cast by claiming that their 
purpose is to relieve "residents of the border areas of the suffering to which 
they were subjected during the eight-year war with Iraq." Their real aim is to 
punish the independence-minded Kurds for siding with Iran against a regime that 
uses the most brutal forms of repression as everyday tools of governance. 
</P>
<P>
This is by no means the first punitive action taken against the Kurds by 
Hussein's regime. Last year, fresh from battle-testing its chemical weapons 
against Iran, the government turned those same toxins against its own citizens, 
murdering as many as 4,000 Kurds in the town of Halabja alone. The more recent 
acts of reprisal have seen an estimated 700 towns and villages depopulated, 
their homes bulldozed into rubble. What seems to be under way is an effort once 
and for all to crush the nationalistic tendencies of that 20% of Iraq's 16 
million people who are non-Arab Kurds. By separating the Kurds from their 
traditional ethnic homeland, the Iraqi regime is also separating them from 
contact with other Kurds immediately across the border in Turkey and Iran. 
That, it hopes, will make them more compliant. 
</P>
<P>
The United States and other Western countries have protested the relocations, 
but to no avail. Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.) proposes to go beyond diplomatic 
complaints by imposing economic sanctions on Iraq if its actions are determined 
to constitute gross violations of human rights. Sanctions could include ending 
all but the most necessary humanitarian aid, banning trade in goods subject to 
export controls and working to block loans and grants from international 
financial institutions. Would even these steps be effective in ending the 
abuses inflicted on Iraq's Kurds? Quite possibly not, given the Baghdad 
regime's repeatedly demonstrated contempt for public opinion and its assessment 
-- unhappily all too correct -- that the world's memory for human rights 
violations tends to be short. But tangible protest measures ought nonetheless 
to be pursued. The Kurds are a people with a very long and often tragic history 
but with few friends and champions. That's all the more reason why the United 
States and other civilized countries should move vigorously to try to lessen 
their sufferings.

PLUGGING UP THE LOOT HOLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Faced with outrageous and still mounting levels of waste, fraud, theft and 
mismanagement that he inherited with the job, U.S. Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development Jack Kemp is saying that enough is enough. 
</P>
<P>
To slow things down until he can get a handle on the mess, Kemp has suspended 
three major programs, but says he has no intention of letting the scandal be 
used by ideological enemies of HUD projects as an excuse kill them outright. 
</P>
<P>
With deficits still running high, Kemp may be in for the fight of his political 
life to keep that promise. HUD programs in 10 cities are under federal 
investigation. A major review of the 28 HUD programs that account for all but 
6% of the money collected and spent by the agency may reveal total losses 
approaching $2 billion dollars. 
</P>
<P>
An important part of President Reagan's appeal to the voters was his rhetoric 
about rooting out waste and fraud, but the looting took place while he was in 
charge. Well-connected Republicans made bundles of money off the moderate 
rehabilitation program, which was intended to encourage the renovation of 
moderately run-down apartments. Billing themselves as consultants, callous 
former Reagan appointees and HUD officials made deals in exchange for fees 
amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars while many of America's poor went 
without decent housing. 
</P>
<P>
HUD's losses include at least $119 million in loan defaults from a program 
intended to provide housing and related services for senior citizens over the 
age of 70. The losses from foreclosure sales are as high as $20 million, 
according to an auditor general's probe, and could go much higher. 
</P>
<P>
With fresh scandals still coming to light, the inclination at HUD seems to be 
to proceed with caution. There is certainly a need to safeguard the public 
trust, but not at the expense of the poor. Outraged Americans must demand 
accountability and an aggressive federal housing program that serves, as Kemp 
put it, the needy, not the greedy.

LEFT'S RESPONSE TO BEIJING MASSACRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I do not wish to engage in an ad hominem exchange with William Kunstler and 
Noam Chomsky (letters, June 24), but I do wish to correct the record. 
</P>
<P>
Chomsky claims that he "condemned" the massacre in an article he wrote for the 
Minneapolis Star-Tribune (June 7). This is the totality of what Chomsky wrote 
about China in the Star-Tribune: 
</P>
<P>
"Power struggles for democracy and human rights also regularly confront deadly 
force, as we have recently seen in Tiananmen Square, Tblisi, Kwangju, and San 
Salvador, among many other cases." 
</P>
<P>
This antiseptic description is far from a condemnation, and by comparing it to 
"many other cases," Chomsky trivializes the enormity of the Chinese massacre. 
</P>
<P>
My associate called Kunstler's office and the woman who identified herself as 
his secretary said that Kunstler had made no statement. This is consistent with 
his long-expressed view that he will not condemn human rights violations by 
socialist countries. Kunstler now claims that one week later (on June 17) he 
did make a statement on "CBS Evening News" during which he condemned the events 
in China as a "massacre." This is what he said: 
</P>
<P>
"If you feel that the Chinese government, or any other government, including 
the American government, are going to use pictures to prosecute people and 
perhaps eventually murder them, then you have an ethical dilemma. . . . Do you 
do it or do you not?" 
</P>
<P>
That is far cry from criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Let me only add that every one of their ad hominem attacks on me for my record 
as a civil libertarian is demonstrably false, as a reading of the public record 
will demonstrate. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the executive director of the National Lawyers Guild told my associate 
that his own personal view was that China should not have used force against 
unarmed civilians, but he reiterated that the Guild, as an organization, could 
come to no organizational position "without more information and discussion."

SUPPORT SYSTEM

President Bush leaves Hungary and Poland today and flies to Paris for the 
economic summit, in his suitcase a piece of the "iron curtain" -- a section of 
barbed wire from the fence that separated Hungary and Austria until this 
spring. "It's a marvelous symbol of this whole visit," Bush said in thanking 
the Hungarian prime minister. Indeed, the barbed wire is exactly what many 
Americans will remember about Bush's Eastern European tour, with its message 
that the harsh division between East and West is melting. But what will the 
Poles and Hungarians remember? 
</P>
<P>
The President carried similiar economic packages to both countries: private 
sector incentives and debt rescheduling. He also gave them similiar messages on 
the political liberalization in both countries: Keep up the good work. But 
Poland and Hungary are very different countries and they received his message 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
The Poles have known Americans for a long time. Presidents Nixon, Ford and 
Carter all made the trip and President Bush himself is no stranger, having 
visited in 1987 as vice president. This familiarity encourages Poles to expect 
a lot from Americans -- more than Americans can afford. The moderate economic 
offerings were bound to be a disappointment, and sure enough, they were. But 
the President was careful to reiterate American support for the crucial process 
of economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
Politically, Poles will remember how even-handed Bush was, lunching with a 
shirt-sleeved Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Communist leader, one day and 
Solidarity's Lech Walesa the next. Although the three never appeared together 
in public, Bush was able to bestow greater legitimacy on the two leaders 
individually, consequently adding legitimacy to their mutual efforts. The ease 
of his manner with both of them may also ease the tension between them. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Poles, the Hungarians had never entertained an American President. 
No matter what he did or said, President Bush was bound to be a novelty. 
Dripping rain on the airport Tarmac, he tore up his prepared speech and handed 
his raincoat to an elderly spectator, an act of impetuousity and kindness that 
was sure to please the crowd. Hungarian leaders said they were surprised by the 
$25 million in aid that Bush offered. "We did not expect money from the United 
States," said Imre Pozsgay, the Hungarian minister of state. Bush's visit could 
not help but bring greater legitimacy to a country long considered something of 
a maverick within the Warsaw Pact. The President could do little wrong in 
Hungary, and didn't. 
</P>
<P>
But what he didn't do in either country -- and what he is absolutely incapable 
of doing -- is tell them how to go about de-communizing their nations and 
economies. That they must discover for themselves.

PALESTINE'S PEACE MAY LIE EAST OF THE JORDAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOV AHARONI, Dov Aharoni is rabbi of Beit Hamidrash in Woodland Hills and 
dean of the West Valley Hebrew Institute. In 1985, he was a co-founder of a 
Jewish settlement in the Samarian region of the West Bank. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past 18 months, Americans have been bombarded with images comparing 
rock-throwing young Arabs with the Israelite David who confronted Goliath in 
biblical days. Images of kaffiyeh-bedecked youths hurling rocks and boulders at 
Israeli soldiers have occupied network television news footage and newspaper 
telephotos. On the surface, their actions seem parallel to the ancient David's. 
Both threw rocks. 
</P>
<P>
But David did not hijack wagons. And David did not murder children. And David 
did not endanger bystanders. He specificly attacked Goliath, who had challenged 
the Israelites to send a representative against him in a one-on-one battle to 
the death. 
</P>
<P>
The bus that traveled on the Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway last week did not carry 
among its passengers any Goliaths, nor did the Achille Lauro cruise ship. They 
carried civilians whose crime was that they were Jewish. And despite Israeli 
politicians' fierce warnings that "Jewish blood is not cheap," these murderers 
have successfully established a different thesis. 
</P>
<P>
The intifada, or Arab uprising, is not limited to a struggle over sovereignty 
in the West Bank regions of Judea and Samaria. Nor has it ever been so 
territorially circumscribed. The intifada is aimed just as surely at Tel Aviv 
and Jerusalem. It is aimed at Haifa and the Galilee. It is aimed at removing 
the Jewish state from a region otherwise in the exclusive orbit of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
No minority has found peace or security under Arab Islamic patronage. Not the 
Berbers of Algeria and not the Kurds of Iraq and not the Coptic Christians of 
Egypt. Even intra-Islamic doctrinal differences become cause for bloodshed: 
Alawites and Sunnis face off in Syria; Iraqi Sunnis wage war for a decade 
against Iranian Shiites; several Lebanese sects intent on destroying one 
another are destroying the very country each seeks to dominate. 
</P>
<P>
The Israelis know what majorities in the Arab Islamic world have done to each 
other and how minorities fare when the dust settles. And the Israelis know that 
their Jewish ethnicity and religion leaves them as the ultimate sitting ducks 
should they ever let down their guard for even a moment. They know that if the 
Syrians can massacre 40,000 of their own countrymen, as happened when the city 
of Hama was razed in 1982, the fate awaiting the Jewish state will not be even 
that merciful. 
</P>
<P>
That is why the Israelis appear to be hard-liners, why they hestitate to 
succumb to the well-meant advice of friends like the U.S. secretary of state 
who never lost a relative to terrorism and whose nation has allies on all its 
borders. 
</P>
<P>
The Arab terrorist who murdered 14 bus passengers on a day's innocent journey 
to Jerusalem undoubtedly sought to send a message to all Israelis. He 
succeeded, but the message he sent may not have been the one intended. 
</P>
<P>
Israel has again faced its enemy, eyeball-to-eyeball, and has seen that there 
are no short roads to peace. Camp David concessions of territory and military 
bases and oil fields have not brought peace. The 1985 Pandora's Box decision to 
release 1,150 convicted Arab terrorists has not brought peace; indeed, many in 
Israel have come to acknowledge that the seeds of the intifada were sown on the 
day those convicts were set loose. Proposals to allow elections among Arabs in 
Judea, Samaria and Gaza have not brought peace. Each Israeli concession has 
instead sent a renewed signal that, given enough pressure, Israel might cave in 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
There is only one course of action left: Israel should annex the West Bank 
regions of Judea and Samaria, in a firm and clear affirmation that the Jews are 
there to stay. The government should disband the military occupation and offer 
every Arab in Judea and Samaria a choice: Stay in your homes and live with us 
in peace, or go to the Palestinian homeland east of the Jordan River and 
express your self-determination there. 
</P>
<P>
The country of Jordan, after all, embraces 78% of Palestine. The majority of 
its citizens are Palestinians. And no one ever did elect King Hussein. Jordan 
is ripe for self-determination.

MORE REPRESENTATION COULD BREAK LEGISLATIVE GRIDLOCK 
</P>

It should tell us something that it was big news recently that the Legislature 
and governor actually were able to agree on a state budget. The bicameral state 
Legislature functions efficiently only as a vehicle to frustrate, delay and 
water down needed legislation. The initiative process is too complex, too 
confusing and there are too many issues to resolve for the voter to have 
anything like an educated opinion on more than one or two. Campaign techniques 
have tended to cloud the process further, exasperating the public. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, this past year more than $100 million was spent on the various 
insurance initiatives. Yet it took a bitter 6-month court battle to determine 
what the voters had said and to determine whether it was constitutional. And 
Proposition 103 is still not fully implemented. 
</P>
<P>
It took the murder of five small children and the wounding of 30 others before 
the Legislature could be moved to act on gun legislation -- and even that was 
watered down, the consequence of heavy gun-lobby pressure. 
</P>
<P>
And only recently the Legislature painfully hammered out a compromise on the 
budget, seeking convoluted means to finance education and other badly needed 
programs even though the state treasury has a $2.5-billion surplus. But the 
final solution still requires voter approval and cannot be put into full force 
until after the June, 1990, primary election. This is the direct result of 
conflicts and contradictions between knee-jerk, reactionary initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
State legislators frequently duck controversial issues in order to avoid 
political accountability. They know that by leaving the decision to the people, 
whose ill-advised votes frequently produce unwise, unworkable, contradictory 
and/or unconstitutional legislation, they can come in quietly in succeeding 
years and amend the voters' choice to suit those interests who finance them and 
whose interests they truly serve. 
</P>
<P>
The rhetorical question must then be asked, "If the Legislature would do its 
job, would there be any need for these confusing initiatives?" The problems are 
serious and reforms are needed. Oddly enough, the solution may be fairly easy 
if the state's voters and their leaders would just face some simple facts. 
</P>
<P>
First, the people of California are the most under-represented in the nation. 
While the average ratio of state representation to citizens is about 1 to 
50,000. California's ratio of one state representative for every 233,491 is out 
of line. Texas and New York are the next most under-represented states, but 
even they have manageable ratios of 1 to 92,734 and 1 to 83,213 respectively. 
California has more than tripled its population over the past 50 years, but the 
size of the Legislature has remained the same. 
</P>
<P>
The intent and purpose of representative government is frustrated by the 
present system; districts are too large, representatives are too far removed 
from their constituents and cost of elections are too dear. The cost of the 
election process favors incumbents who can provide favors for their financiers. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the bicameral Legislature is no longer necessary. The U.S. Senate 
represents the states (each state having two senators regardless of size or 
population). In contrast to pre-1965, when California state Senate 
representation was apportioned by counties, not population, the upper house no 
longer has any independent significance. 
</P>
<P>
I propose that we abolish the bicameral Legislature and elect an enlarged 
unicameral House of Assembly, chaired by the lieutenant governor, with one 
legislator for every 100,000 Californians. This measure would increase the 
number of state representatives from 120 (80 Assembly members and 40 senators) 
to 280 at present population levels. The smaller districts would bring the 
legislators closer to their constituents and reduce the significance of money 
in legislative campaigns. Further, the single house would eliminate overlapping 
committees and the duplication and delaying of legislation. California cities 
and counties have had single-house legislative bodies for many years. 
</P>
<P>
We also should limit access to the initiative process to those measures that 
have been submitted to three successive sessions of the Legislature. Many 
states have modified their initiative process, limiting its misuse and abuse, 
placing the legislative burden back where it belongs -- with the state 
legislature. Too often the initiative process in California has become the 
vehicle for frivolous and irresponsible proposals of fringe groups and 
political extremists. 
</P>
<P>
A large legislative Assembly is difficult to manipulate and control and 
therefore more responsive to its constituency. Conversely, small districts can 
be effectively canvassed by an energetic candidate with a small group of 
supporters, thus reducing the power of money in a campaign. Since 
personal-contact precinct work has always proven more effective in voter canvas 
than mass media, the under-financed candidate can present himself or herself on 
more fair footing with the affluent. The representative political process is 
thereby improved, legislation expedited and accountability to the constituency 
increased. This would produce a more responsive, efficient, less expensive and 
more effective legislative system for the nation's wealthiest and most populous 
state.

FEEDING THE EXTREMISTS ON BOTH SIDES;

LIKUD EXPRESSES AN IDEOLOGY, AND FEAR OF CATASTROPHE GROWS

<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's peace plan for the occupied territories 
consisted of two parts: To the Americans, he brandished the election proposal; 
to the Israelis, he reiterated that there would never be a Palestinian state or 
negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization, that Palestinians in 
East Jerusalem would not participate in the elections, that the intifada must 
first be suppressed, and that Jewish settlements would continue to be built in 
the territories. 
</P>
<P>
The first part of his plan was diplomacy. The second was policy and ideology, 
to which he and his party are deeply committed. 
</P>
<P>
For the sake of diplomacy, Shamir has tried to keep these two parts loosely 
connected. The U.S. Administration was thus led to believe that the process of 
elections would elegantly relegate the second part to irrelevance. What Trade 
Minister Ariel Sharon did last week at the Likud Party's Central Committee 
meeting was no more than to fasten the two parts together into one package. 
Shamir was absolutely correct when he stated that the resolution adopted by the 
Central Committee required no change of position. "What is new in this?" asked 
Shamir's spokesman after the vote. "We've said all these things before." The 
difference between Shamir and Sharon is only one of style and tactics, not of 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
The expectation that, with his election proposal, Shamir had turned his back on 
the Likud basic position was absurd. Apparently, he hoped that ugly bickering 
within the PLO would bring to naught his proposal. However, a policy based on 
the expectation that the adversary will save one from his contradictions is not 
viable. The claims that nothing is changed and that the elections proposal is 
still on the agenda are dishonest. Can one expect the Palestinians to start 
negotiations on the basis of the Likud resolution? It will also become 
impossible to soothe over the incompatibility between the Likud position of no 
withdrawal from most of the territories and the Labor Party's position of land 
for peace. 
</P>
<P>
The PLO's acceptance of United Nations Resolution 242 and its recognition of 
the existence of Israel constitutes adoption of the two-state solution. The 
Palestinians will never resign themselves to the notion that they are inferior 
to the Israelis, who deserve to have a state, while they should be content with 
autonomy under Israeli aegis or under the Jordanian crown. Incipient American 
recognition that there is no escape from a two-state solution, predicated on 
the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, was perhaps implied by 
Secretary of State James A. Baker III in his May 22 speech to the American 
Israel Public Affairs Committee, stating the need for the Palestinians "to 
achieve their full political rights." This was the main novelty of the speech. 
"Full political rights" cannot mean the right to be subservient to Israel or to 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
The main argument of PLO extremists within is that PLO moderates are mistaken 
in their belief that a compromise solution with Israel is possible. They claim 
that the Israeli government will never agree to grant the Palestinians their 
minimum demands for a state, small as it may be. Palestinian concessions will 
be in vain. They argue that Israeli ethnocentric insistence that only Israelis 
will have a state does not only manifest condemnable behavior but a depraved 
entity with which coexistence is impossible. Thus, they contend that the 
moderates' position is not viable and that eventually they will be compelled to 
join the extremists. This explains the extremists' present political 
quiescence. At the 19th session of the Palestine National Congress, extremist 
leaders expressed their readiness to allow Yasser Arafat to pursue his 
pragmatic line until history proves him wrong. 
</P>
<P>
No one can predict how long Palestinian moderates can maintain the upper hand 
in the absence of visible progress toward a settlement. Once overrun by their 
extremists, symmetry will be achieved -- on both sides extremists will be at 
the helm. Extremists are not overly concerned by the radicalization of the 
conflict. They regard the conflict as a process of competitive attrition in 
which their own side will prevail and the rival will come to grief. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides grapple with the demographic problem of being stuck with a large 
number of Jews in the greater Arab state and a large Arab population in the 
greater Israel. For both, the solution is transfer, if not as a forceful event 
then as a process. Jews will be loathe to live in an Arab state and Arabs will 
hate living in a Jewish state. Thus one or the other will prefer to emigrate. 
Euphemistically, this is referred to as "voluntary transfer." 
</P>
<P>
But both are mistaken in not realizing how calamitous the future will be for 
Israelis and Palestinians if a settlement to the conflict is not achieved. 
Catastrophe will not bring salvation to one side, but ruin to both. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the superpowers are in a better position to evaluate the dangers that 
lurk when the situation is left to fester. As conflicts all around the world 
are being solved, the Arab-Israeli conflict will stick out as an abnormality. 
Considering the potential for violence, the superpowers may decide to 
collaborate in goading the parties toward negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Wisdom lies in nipping trends in the bud. It was needed in the past but was not 
available. The need is greater now to forestall the catastrophic visions of the 
extremists from coming true.

TOLERANCE RUNS OUT FOR A KINDLY CONNOISSEUR OF JUNK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Being a nice guy has long paid off for Adolph Leben, a mild-mannered recluse 
who seems to have won the affection of his Thousand Oaks neighbors despite the 
growing pile of junk in his yard. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade or so, as families have come and gone and gardens and 
children have flourished, Leben's property on Havenwood Drive has been steadily 
obscured by rusting cars and scrap metal, tires, wooden planks, rolls of 
fencing and other glaring aberrations in a community known for order and 
affluence. 
</P>
<P>
"One pallet of bricks has been there so long it has a three-and-a-half-foot 
pine tree growing out of it," said Deputy City Atty. Nancy Schreiner. 
</P>
<P>
This week, after years of avoiding any serious punitive action against Leben, 
the City Council decided to renew a Municipal Court case that could result in 
jail for a man consistently described by neighbors as gentle, helpful and 
pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
Schreiner said the council, which rejected a plan to clear the yard with 
$15,000 in public funds, will ask the court to revoke a three-year probation 
levied against Leben in April after he pleaded guilty to causing a public 
nuisance. The council addressed the issue Tuesday because Leben failed to 
comply with a court order to clean up his property, even after receiving a 
six-week extension that ended July 1, Schreiner said. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone chops down a tree and he wants not only the cords but the twigs," said 
Councilman Alex Fiore, who lives in Leben's neighborhood and has been aware of 
the junk for years. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants to put anybody in jail for something like that," Fiore said 
before the council meeting. "Chances are if he'd at least kept up the front 
yard it would have been overlooked. What's out of sight is out of mind." 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors Ken and Susan Bachner and George and Sandy Elias agreed, suggesting 
that Leben has managed to avoid prosecution not only because of his personality 
but because his yard is set back from the street and not readily seen. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel bad that it's going through criminal prosecution," Ken Bachner said 
Wednesday in response to the council's decision. "We have some serious problems 
out there, and to punish this man with jail time, I don't agree with that. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a wonderful guy who just has this particular idiosyncrasy, and I don't 
know how you go about punishing someone for that," said Bachner, summing up the 
neighborhood's prevailing attitude. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently impressed by Leben's helpfulness and old-world demeanor, residents 
have by and large looked the other way over the years, only quietly complaining 
to local authorities and then apologizing for causing their neighbor any 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"If your car broke down and he didn't know you, he'd stop and help you; that's 
what kind of man he is," said Susan Bachner, who's marveled at Leben's 
collection for nearly 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, you can have neat neighbors who aren't nice," she continued. "That's 
why no one pushes it." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, even officials have been reluctant to act, despite years of polite 
notices, many promises to clean things up, the Municipal Court case and a blaze 
April 14 on Leban's property in which firefighters were hampered by the 
clutter. Residents say the fire started when an electrical wire fell on a tree. 
</P>
<P>
A testament to Southern Californian tolerance, or simply an example of a 
kinder, gentler suburbia? "I think it's a testament to the man," said one 
neighborhood newcomer who was tempted to make a stink about Leben's mess -- 
then changed her mind after meeting him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Just Can't' 
</P>
<P>
"My husband and I looked at each other and said, 'We can't do that. We just 
can't,' " said the young mother, who, like other neighbors, was reluctant to 
talk because she didn't want to hurt Leben's feelings or expose him to more 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been burned," said one neighbor, protective to the point of lecturing a 
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Attracting Attention 
</P>
<P>
Several residents said recent publicity over the junk in the yard has turned 
the quiet cul-de-sac into a sideshow -- attracting gawkers to the Leben home in 
the 1800 block of Havenwood Drive and frightening the owner, who is described 
as intensely private. 
</P>
<P>
No one seems to know much about Leben, although several neighbors thought he 
works for the aerospace industry. Local lore places Leben in his 40s, has him 
married, and holds that his two young children play with other neighborhood 
youngsters and attend parochial school. 
</P>
<P>
A tall man with a football player's broad build, Leben twice fled from a 
reporter Tuesday, once on foot and once in his red pickup truck. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a real big embarrassment for him," the young mother said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fascinated Neighbors 
</P>
<P>
His nocturnal routine has fascinated neighbors. Rapt, they have watched him 
unload his truck at 4 a.m., move piles from one side of the yard to the other, 
and just this week plant a few shrubs -- perhaps in an attempt at camouflage -- 
beneath a midnight moon. 
</P>
<P>
"He always imports, never exports," quipped next-door-neighbor Sandy Elias. 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago, we took down a fence in the back, and he asked if he could have 
the stuff," said Debra Strong, who lives around the corner on El Monte Drive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a difficult issue," said Ken Bachner. "He's one of the nicest people 
you'd ever want to meet. I have a problem with this because, on the one hand, 
he has a right to store what he wants to on his own property. On the other 
hand, it's an eyesore and nuisance to the community. 
</P>
<P>
"If he were to confine it to his back yard, I'd be perfectly happy. As it is, 
it doesn't bother me. This is not worth pulling your hair over."

EL SEGUNDO GIVES PRELIMINARY OK TO HIKE TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM WATERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Segundo council members voted 3 to 2 Tuesday to abandon a proposed payroll 
tax on business and instead informally approved a plan to raise three existing 
taxes to solve the city's financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
The new plan, which was approved by voice vote but must be formally adopted by 
the council, was proposed by Mayor Carl Jacobson and harshly denounced by the 
two councilmen who voted against it, Scot Dannen and Jim Clutter. 
</P>
<P>
Clutter predicted that the plan would not raise enough new money because the 
city has previously encountered difficulty in collecting one of the taxes that 
would be increased. 
</P>
<P>
He also accused Jacobson of bowing to local business interests, who have 
appealed to council members not to pass a payroll tax. 
</P>
<P>
"His No. 1 obligation appears to be political rather than to try to plan how 
this community is going to work in the future as far as fiscal policy," Clutter 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Jacobson countered that his plan would work, and that compared to a payroll 
tax, it was easier and more practical to administer because the type of taxes 
that would be raised are already being collected. 
</P>
<P>
He denied that he kowtowed to business. "I have never been afraid to stand up 
to business," the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
The council has been grappling for months over how to increase city revenues. 
Without new revenues, the city faces a $1.6-million budget deficit this fiscal 
year, as well as further postponement of a number of capital improvement 
projects that it has not been able to afford. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, after numerous meetings and study sessions, council members 
proposed that a payroll tax be adopted -- a move that was quickly opposed by a 
number of companies, including Hughes Aircraft, the largest employer in the 
city, and Rockwell International. 
</P>
<P>
The two companies asserted that such a tax would discriminate against them 
because of the large numbers of highly paid professionals on their payrolls. A 
payroll tax is levied as a percentage of the amount a company spends on wages 
and salaries. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes and Rockwell threw their support behind a proposal by the city's 
500-member Chamber of Commerce that the city's existing employee and 
square-footage taxes be raised. 
</P>
<P>
Under the major elements of the plan approved informally on Tuesday, the 
employee tax will double to $120 per worker, and the square-footage tax will 
quadruple to 20 cents a square foot. In addition, an acreage tax imposed on 
some industrial businesses, including the city's sprawling Chevron refinery, 
would jump from $300 to $500. Future increases would be tied to the consumer 
price index. 
</P>
<P>
In Rockwell's case, the increases in the employee and square-footage taxes 
would cost the company an additional $500,000 annually, according to George 
Wiley, Rockwell's director of human resources. "Roughly, our taxes will 
double," he said. The taxes are assessed each year. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the plan is expected to raise more than $4 million annually in new 
revenues, according to city estimates. 
</P>
<P>
But Clutter argued that figure would not stand because of the problems that the 
city has experienced in collecting the employee tax from companies that hire 
temporary, or contract, workers and do not count them as part of their work 
force. This is particularly true of aerospace companies, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the new revenue plan calls for stiffer penalties to be formulated 
to ensure compliance, Clutter said he believes that the city will be unable to 
collect the money it is entitled to. 
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't worked in the past. It is not a method we can track," he said. "I 
feel in a year or less we are going to come back to the table and we aren't 
going to have enough money." 
</P>
<P>
Dannen, who favored a payroll tax along with Clutter, argued that by raising 
the square-footage tax, the city would discourage retail development, thereby 
depriving the city of sales tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Very Serious Concerns' 
</P>
<P>
"I'm having some very serious concerns about where we are heading," Dannen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The city has no major retailers, and council members have repeatedly said that 
attracting such development is one of their main priorities. 
</P>
<P>
The plan given tentative approval Tuesday calls for retailers to get a 30-cent 
rebate on each dollar of sales tax revenue they generate for the city, a move 
designed to encourage retailers to settle in the city. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BIGGER TAX BITE FOR EL SEGUNDO BUSINESSES 
</P>
<P>
El Segundo has abandoned a proposed payroll tax in favor of increasing three 
existing city taxes to erase a projected 1989-1990 $1.6-million deficit in a 
$20-million operating budget. Total revenues are projections for the three 
taxes at the old and new levels.

JURY TO DECIDE HOSPITAL MOLESTATION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a police matter, the facts of the case seemed clear. 
</P>
<P>
A 6-year-old boy reported that he had been with two elders from his Torrance 
church on a Sunday afternoon mission to Harbor Convalescent Hospital when a man 
he had never seen before lured him into a treatment room and sexually molested 
him. 
</P>
<P>
The boy said that he will never forget his attacker -- a toothless, bearded man 
with horribly swollen legs that were covered with open sores. 
</P>
<P>
That description pointed investigators to Alfred Ray Hatch, a mentally 
disturbed patient at the hospital, who admitted that he molested the boy, 
sheriff's detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
That was more than five years ago, and authorities say that the 52-year-old 
schizophrenic, who was committed to a state mental hospital for an indefinite 
period after a competency hearing, probably will never face criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
But the question of who should be held accountable for the assault has not been 
entirely resolved. 
</P>
<P>
This week, a Van Nuys Superior Court jury must decide if the administration and 
staff of Harbor Convalescent Hospital should share the blame for the assault. 
</P>
<P>
In closing arguments Tuesday, lawyer Richard Farnell asked the jury to award 
more than $10 million in damages to the boy, now 12, and his mother. Farnell 
argued that the hospital was negligent because it let the boy wander unattended 
down its hallways on Jan. 22, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
The boy "is going to have to live with this for the rest of his life," Farnell 
said. "This is probably the most horrible series of events you will ever hear 
about." 
</P>
<P>
But Ray Moore, representing the hospital, argued that the attack could not have 
been foreseen and that the hospital could not properly treat patients if it had 
to constantly police its visitors. "The real question is: Did the hospital 
properly balance security with its therapeutic duties?" Moore said. "This was 
an open facility, not a prison." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said Hatch was transferred to Harbor Convalescent Hospital from another 
facility that gave no warning he might be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
Moore also contested assertions by the boy's mother that he was a normal child 
before the attack. Moore said he presented witnesses that said the boy had a 
history of behavioral problems and learning disabilities that dated back to the 
age of 2. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit filed by the boy and his mother, who now live in Huntington Beach, 
originally included a second defendant, Faith of Our Fathers Church in 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
On the day of the alleged attack, the youngster went to the convalescent 
hospital with two church members for a regular Sunday prayer meeting with 
patients. The lawsuit charged that the church, now called the Living Word 
Fellowship, was partly liable for the assault because the two parishioners left 
the boy unattended while they conducted the prayer meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The mother sometimes left the boy in the care of other parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
But the church was dropped from the lawsuit last month when it agreed to a 
settlement, without admitting liability. The church will pay the boy and his 
mother $200,000 each immediately and guarantee that the youngster will receive 
at least $600,000 more. The future payment will be reduced by any damages that 
the convalescent hospital is ordered to pay, said the church's lawyer, Tony 
Serritella. 
</P>
<P>
Serritella had argued that the Torrance congregation could not be held liable, 
because the hospital visits were the personal ministry of the two men and not 
church-sanctioned events. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Church Denies Liability 
</P>
<P>
"The church still denies any liability in this matter," Serritella said. "The 
settlement was a financial decision by the church's insurance carriers." 
</P>
<P>
Farnell argued Tuesday that Harbor Convalescent Hospital, at 21521 S. Vermont 
Ave. in the Harbor Gateway near Torrance, had been negligent in several ways. 
</P>
<P>
He said the hospital was not licensed to provide special care for a mental 
patient like Hatch and that administrators failed to properly research the 
patient's background. Hatch was admitted to the hospital on the recommendation 
of a physician. A background search would have shown that Hatch previously had 
been committed for 10 years to a state mental hospital and had previously been 
accused of child molestation, Farnell said. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital employees lost track of Hatch for at least 45 minutes on the afternoon 
of the alleged assault, Farnell said. "If they had supervised him properly, 
this never would have happened," he argued. 
</P>
<P>
Farnell said the hospital should have been on notice that its supervision was 
inadequate because of two previous incidents: A month earlier police picked up 
a patient who wandered away from the hospital undetected and just four days 
before the alleged assault, a state inspector told administrators that they 
needed more supervisors on duty. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Requires Tutoring 
</P>
<P>
Farnell said the damage to the youngster cannot be calculated. The boy has been 
hospitalized for severe depression and anxiety and has attempted suicide 10 
times. 
</P>
<P>
The youngster attends public school but requires tutoring and has trouble 
communicating with other children, Farnell said. 
</P>
<P>
He said the boy should be put in a residential treatment program for at least 
six months and then given out-patient counseling, along with his mother. 
Farnell asked the jury to award about $400,000 to cover past and future costs 
of therapy and hospitalization and $10 million for pain and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
The youngster "looks at himself as spoiled goods," Farnell said. "The quality 
of his life will never be what it should have been . . . . (He) is permanently 
scarred." 
</P>
<P>
Moore asked the jury to put aside such emotional pleas and to judge the case 
logically. 
</P>
<P>
He said the hospital had provided a reasonable amount of security without 
jeopardizing its goal of providing a "homelike therapeutic atmosphere" for 
patients. "Foolproof security can't be provided," he said. "The standard for 
licensed nursing facilities does not require a foolproof system." 
</P>
<P>
Moore conceded that the boy had been molested but said the hospital could not 
have foreseen the crime. The facilities where Hatch lived before gave no 
indication that he had been violent or sexually active and he did not show 
those tendencies in his first 13 months at Harbor Convalescent Hospital, Moore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Interfering With Recovery' 
</P>
<P>
Further, an outside doctor who ordered Hatch, a Medi-Cal patient, admitted to 
the hospital did not order that he should be restrained or kept away from other 
people, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
Moore also charged that after the incident, the boy's mother had failed to 
bring him to psychotherapy appointments and had not given him drugs ordered by 
his doctors. 
</P>
<P>
She "has actively been interfering with the recovery of the boy from the time 
of this incident," Moore said. "She has actively interfered with his therapy 
from the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
Moore said that the mother, perhaps anticipating a large payoff in the civil 
suit, even rewarded the boy with gifts "for playing the part of the boy who was 
molested, instead of dealing with his real problems." 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for both sides said they expect the jury's deliberations to last at 
least until next week.

MOBIL PLANT CREW SLEEPS ON THE JOB, EX-EMPLOYEE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE STEIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A former Mobil refinery worker filed a complaint with federal officials 
Wednesday, alleging that employees at the Torrance refinery frequently sleep on 
the job, endangering their own safety as well as that of others, and that they 
are rarely disciplined for the practice. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a serious problem which is having a great impact on the quality of the 
operation," said Bruce Lohmann, 34, of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a potential for . . . a disaster because of the sleeping problem," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
But Mobil refinery manager Wyman Robb said that sleeping on the job rarely 
occurs at the refinery. It violates policy, he said, and when discovered, is 
punished severely. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Charges Denied 
</P>
<P>
"The situation that he described would not be tolerated in a refinery," Robb 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Robb characterized Lohmann as a disgruntled ex-employee who did not get along 
with fellow employees and who left after refinery management was not willing to 
promote him to a supervisory position. 
</P>
<P>
Lohmann disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I got along with my co-workers as well as anyone there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he left after working as an assistant operations worker at Mobil from 
Jan. 9 to May 18 because of his concerns for safety at the refinery -- and 
after receiving a job offer from a local government agency that he asked not be 
named. Before coming to Mobil, Lohmann said, he worked for about five years at 
the Chevron refinery in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to filing a complaint with the federal Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration, he talked with a Cal-OSHA official who said the agency 
would investigate his allegations, Lohmann said. He said he also will meet with 
Torrance Fire Department officials Monday to brief them about what he 
experienced at Mobil. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Kenneth Hall, the department's chief fire investigator, said, "If that 
type of thing is occurring, we would encourage people to come forward, even 
anonymously. . . . We would definitely encourage him to come and talk." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Lohmann said that after he arrived at Mobil, he was concerned 
to find what he called a less vigilant atmosphere about safety than the one at 
Chevron. He said he had been a member of a Chevron plant safety committee. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, when I initially got there (at Mobil), I enjoyed the easygoing 
atmosphere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw problems from the start, but it was quite easygoing and relaxed and 
kick-back, compared to Chevron. Mobil being a very large company, I thought I 
would have the same standard. I got increasingly concerned, and then scared." 
</P>
<P>
He said he saw a number of problems soon after being hired. A pump that was 
scheduled for repair was not properly fenced off, he said, although it was 
leaking toxic, explosive fumes. He also said an improper procedure was used to 
fix a leak in a furnace tube, creating the potential for an explosive fire. 
</P>
<P>
After routine training for new employees, he was assigned to the platinum 
treating reformer, a unit that boosts the octane of unleaded gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked day shift and night shift. I saw workers sleeping on each and every 
shift that I worked," he said. "It was a daily occurrence." 
</P>
<P>
In his complaint, Lohmann said the sleeping took place in some of the 
refinery's smaller control rooms where shift supervisors are not stationed, 
including the control rooms of the platinum treating reformer, the fluid 
catalytic cracking unit and the crude distillation unit. 
</P>
<P>
In the control room of the unit where he worked, he said in the interview, he 
saw sleeping workers "typically, slouched back. Some people would be leaning 
forward on the desk with their hands in front of them, with their heads on 
their arms." 
</P>
<P>
In other control rooms where the lighting was stronger, he said, he saw 
operators with coats over their heads to block out the lights. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Everyone Asleep 
</P>
<P>
He said he sometimes came to his control room and found everyone asleep. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked on different shifts there. I saw every head operator sleeping. . . . 
I was lectured to by senior operators about not waking them, to be careful when 
I come in and out of the control room not to make too much noise. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The unit would be unattended. These units are designed to run automatically, 
which is why people can sleep," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to monitor every second, and the materials will still flow 
through the pipes; they will still be heated, and the chemical reactions will 
occur. The problem is when a (process) controller fails, or a pump seal fails, 
or something changes." 
</P>
<P>
In the spring, Lohmann said, supervisors clamped down briefly on sleeping and 
began showing up unannounced. He said some of the operators evaded the 
crackdown by going outside and sleeping in a tent that had been set up for a 
repair job. 
</P>
<P>
Lohmann said he himself slept on the job several times. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a hard time sleeping at work," he said. "I would have slept more if I 
had been able to get to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
Lohmann declined to provide the names of the individuals he saw sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
He attributed much of the alleged sleeping on the job to a schedule in which 
refinery employees work 12-hour shifts of 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., for example, for 
several days, then have several days off, and come back to work 6 p.m. to 6 
a.m. This creates a sort of super jet lag, in which employees switch day for 
night several times during the 14-day schedule, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The desire to sleep can be very powerful," he said. "Many workers told me they 
don't like the schedule, and they find the only way open to them: They find a 
place to sleep." 
</P>
<P>
Mobil officials dispute every point in Lohmann's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
Robb denied that sleeping is a significant problem. He added that five 
employees out of 800 had been disciplined in the last two years for sleeping, 
with punishments ranging from a 10-day suspension to a written reprimand. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Problem Called Rare 
</P>
<P>
Phil Wright, a Mobil shift supervisor who Lohmann said was known as a 
hard-liner against sleeping, also said that the problem was rare. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't come across someone sleeping very often. They know how I feel, and 
they know I will take action, so I don't come by it very often," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Robb said the shift schedule is supported by the employees, who prefer long 
weekends and the reduced commuting time that it provides. 
</P>
<P>
But support of a general nature for some of Lohmann's contentions emerged last 
month in the largest U.S. study of sleeping on the job among shift workers. 
</P>
<P>
The survey of 7,400 refinery, chemical plant, power plant and factory shift 
workers, by three California researchers, found that sleepiness is a widespread 
problem that can cause accidents and poor performance. Among shift workers at 
refineries and chemical plants, 60% reported sleeping regularly during night 
shifts. 
</P>
<P>
At the Torrance City Council meeting Tuesday, Councilman Dan Walker brought up 
Lohmann's allegations, which first appeared in the Daily Breeze. "It sounds 
funny until you find that it's really not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, who is sponsoring a ballot initiative to substantially reduce the use 
of acutely hazardous hydrofluoric acid at the refinery, said Lohmann's 
allegations heightened his concerns about safety at the plant.

MAN SENTENCED TO PRISON OVER 3 DEATHS IN ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A 22-year-old Los Angeles man was sentenced Wednesday to four years in prison 
for causing a traffic accident in Reseda that killed an 11-month-old baby and 
his grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Kathryne Ann Stoltz imposed the sentence on 
Gregory Masterson Michael, who was convicted by a jury last month of three 
counts of felony vehicular manslaughter in connection with the Oct. 27 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses testified during the trial that Michael was driving up to 60 m.p.h. 
when he ran a red light and slammed into the car occupied by the victims. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Rochel, 84, of Beverly Hills; his wife Ashraf, 71, and their grandson, 
Jonathan Rochel, died in the accident at Victory Boulevard and White Oak 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The infant's mother, Fereshteh Rochel, 27, of Reseda, was driving the car and 
suffered a broken hip and several broken ribs. 
</P>
<P>
Michael, who worked as a plumber, testified at his trial that he had just 
gotten off work and was in a hurry to get home and go to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
Before sentencing Wednesday, an emotional Michael asked to address the court 
and members of the victims' family present in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to apologize to the family," Michael said as he began sobbing. "I 
feel that I've had a fair trial." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Deputy Dist. Atty. Phillip H. Rabichow said he was satisfied with 
the sentence. "I felt the judge was very fair." 
</P>
<P>
The families of both the defendant and the victims declined comment.

DEADLINE FOR QUAKE REPAIR IS EXTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Torrance City Council voted unanimously to extend by two months a deadline 
for obtaining building permits for renovation of pre-1933 masonry buildings to 
meet new earthquake codes. 
</P>
<P>
The extension, which was approved with little discussion Tuesday, gives owners 
of older brick and wood buildings until Sept. 1 to take out the building 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said the extension also gives the city time to create a board of 
appeals to review applications for further deadline extensions. The board will 
be made up of one representative of the city Redevelopment Agency, the fire 
marshal and the city manager's office. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the Whittier-Narrows Earthquake in October, 1987, the City 
Council in December, 1987, passed an ordinance requiring owners of pre-1933 
buildings to reinforce walls and ceilings with steel bolts. 
</P>
<P>
It required that property owners complete all repairs by July, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
About 14 landlords have requested an extension of the deadline, saying they 
could not find engineers to design renovation plans in time to meet the July 1 
cut-off date, city officials said. Some landlords have said the new 
requirements brought a backlog of contracts to many builders and engineers. 
</P>
<P>
There are 50 buildings, mostly in Old Downtown Torrance, that need 
earthquake-safety improvements. Renovations have been completed on six of those 
buildings, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 200 to 300 people occupy those buildings during the day and as 
many as 500 people live in them at night, city officials said. Most of them are 
apartments or restaurants.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WAN RESPONSE TO USERS' TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rolling Hills Estates residents expressed little interest Tuesday in supporting 
a 5% utility users' tax to purchase undeveloped land that would be retained as 
open space. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council is considering whether to place the tax measure on the 
November ballot, but only six residents addressed the council Tuesday, at the 
first of two public hearings on the matter. All spoke in favor of retaining 
open space, but only two said they were willing to pay for its preservation 
with a utility users' tax. 
</P>
<P>
The idea was proposed by a blue-ribbon committee organized in May at the 
council's request to examine options for purchasing undeveloped land in the 
city. The committee said the tax, lasting five or 10 years, should be put on 
the ballot if there is public support for it. The measure would require 
approval by two-thirds of the voters to become law. 
</P>
<P>
The proposal stems from controversy two years ago over the closed Dapplegray 
Intermediate School. Some residents criticized the council for not moving to 
acquire the site, which has an estimated market value of $5 million. The 
council said the city could not afford it.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: STREET NAME CHANGE OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of Hawthorne has joined with Lawndale and Gardena in changing the name 
of Compton Boulevard to Marine Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The decision Monday by the Hawthorne City Council will affect two segments of 
the boulevard, from Yukon to Prairie avenues, and from the San Diego Freeway to 
Aviation Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Hawthorne City Manager R. Kenneth Jue said Tuesday that members of the South 
Bay Cities Assn. decided to change the name to make it "more symbolic of the 
South Bay cities." 
</P>
<P>
Manhattan Beach has called the street Marine Avenue since the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
Lawndale has already posted some Marine Avenue signs. Hawthorne plans to do so 
in the near future, and Gardena has set a target date of Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists may experience some confusion on Compton/Marine between Inglewood 
Avenue and Aviation Boulevard. On the north side, in Lawndale and Hawthorne, it 
will be called Marine, and on the south side, in Redondo Beach, it will still 
be known as Compton Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Beach City Council thus far has shown no interest in the matter. 
"We haven't seen . . . any compelling reason to change the street name," Cidy 
Manager Tim Casey said Tuesday. But now that the name will be Marine to the 
east, west and north of Redondo's borders, the city too may have to consider 
the change, he said.

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 'HERITAGE COURT' PROGRESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dominguez Park in Redondo Beach is one step closer to becoming the permanent 
home of Morrell House and two other historic homes. The City Council Tuesday 
approved the concept of a "heritage court" for historic houses at the park on 
190th Street. 
</P>
<P>
It now requires approval from the Parks and Recreation and Planning 
commissions. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed plan would put the historic home, built in the 1900s, next to a 
parking lot near Flagler Lane. Although the council set aside space for two 
additional historic homes in the nine-acre park, those buildings have not been 
chosen. 
</P>
<P>
The Morrell House on North Carolina Street was bought in November, 1987, and 
the site was developed for condominiums. Simon Chang, the developer, donated 
the house to the city when preservationists sought to have it saved. 
</P>
<P>
The city relocated the Morrell House to Perry Allison Playfield in March. But 
residents near that small park objected to the loss of open space. Since then 
the city has sought alternative sites for the heritage court. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated cost for the move of the home to Dominguez Park would be $17,200, 
city officials said.

2 CONVICTED OF MURDERING SYLMAR MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After a week of deliberations, a San Fernando Superior Court jury Wednesday 
convicted two men of murdering a Sylmar man who was chaperoning a Sweet 16 
party last year. 
</P>
<P>
John Tanner, 23, of Lake View Terrace was found guilty of shooting John Shaw, 
23. Jeffrey Evans, 24, of Lake View Terrace was found guilty of second-degree 
murder for aiding and abetting Tanner. 
</P>
<P>
But the jurors were still deliberating the charges against Dennis Elliot, 24, 
of Pacoima, who prosecutors charge was involved in the quarrel that provoked 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
During the eight-week trial, Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward Nison argued that 
Tanner, Evans and Elliot, who he said are gang members, approached Shaw as he 
stood with other guests in front of the house in the 14900 block of Aztec 
Street in Sylmar. Evans asked the party-goers if they were affiliated with 
gangs. Shaw replied that he was not, which Tanner interpreted as a slight, 
Nison said. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner shot Shaw four or five times in the back and chest, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Tanner testified he was asleep at home after drinking with friends all day when 
the shooting took place. 
</P>
<P>
Evans and Elliot also are charged with attempted murder in a drive-by shooting 
involving a 20-year-old Pacoima man, Cedric Finley, in Lake View Terrace about 
half an hour before the Sylmar killing. Finley was shot at four times but was 
uninjured, Nison said. 
</P>
<P>
The jury was still deliberating charges stemming from that shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Sentencing for Tanner and Evans was set for Aug. 11. Both face a maximum 
sentence of life imprisonment.

Top-seeded Andre Agassi routed Steve Guy of New Zealand, 6-4, 6-0, Wednesday 
night in his opening match of the U.S. Pro Tennis championships at Brookline, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Agassi struggled a bit in the first set but took charge in the second, breaking 
his 220th-ranked foe in the first, second and fifth games to end the match in 
exactly one hour. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Mats Wilander required only 77 minutes to dispose of Michael 
Robertson of South Africa, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
Wilander took a 4-1 lead in the first set but needed to hold service in the 
eighth game and a service break in the ninth to beat Robertson, ranked 218 in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the tournament's third-seeded player, Alberto Mancini of Argentina, 
lost to Phil Johnson, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2. Johnson lost in qualifying but got into 
the tournament because of several withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
In another match, fourth-seeded Jay Berger ousted Martin Wostenholme of Canada, 
6-3, 3-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Paul Annacone rallied for a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 victory over Brad Drewett 
of Australia and advanced to the quarterfinals of the Volvo Tennis-Hall of Fame 
Championship at Newport, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
Annacone trailed, 0-40, in the opening game of the final set before coming on 
to break Drewett's serve and take control of the match. 
</P>
<P>
Annacone will play Glenn Layendecker, a 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 winner over eighth-seeded 
Kelly Evernden of New Zealand, in one of Thursday's quarter-finals. 
</P>
<P>
In other matches, Christian Saceanu of West Germany upset fourth-seeded Derrick 
Rostagno, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (7-5), and Danie Viser of South Africa knocked off 
seventh-seeded Pieter Aldrich, also of South Africa, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3. 
Second-seeded Johan Kriek defeated Gary Muller of South Africa, 6-1, 6-4, and 
sixth-seeded Peter Lundgren of Sweden beat Jeff Tarango, 6-4, 7-5.

EASY GOER WILL HAVE TO TAKE ON OLDER HORSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Christine 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shug McGaughey has been fortunate that his barn has been deep in talent in most 
divisions this year. Belmont Stakes winner Easy Goer is about the only 
important McGaughey runner who has escaped injury. 
</P>
<P>
Because of circumstances, Easy Goer has been pushed into an unlikely role -- 
McGaughey's wild-card substitute. An ankle injury to Seeking the Gold, who was 
expected to be McGaughey's best older horse, has thrust Easy Goer into the job 
of running outside the 3-year-old division in the Whitney Handicap at Saratoga 
on Aug. 5. McGaughey had planned to run Easy Goer against 3-year-olds until 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
Dancing Spree might have been McGaughey's candidate for the Whitney, after his 
victory over some members of the weak handicap division in the Suburban at 
Belmont Park on July 4. But Dancing Spree, a son of Nijinsky II, has grass 
breeding, and McGaughey still thinks he will run well on the turf. As a 
3-year-old last year, however, Dancing Spree was winless in six grass starts. 
</P>
<P>
Dancing Spree is one of those McGaughey horses who showed only ordinary talent 
initially. Awe Inspiring is another example, and while he is not in the same 
league with Easy Goer, he is still part of a large group of horses that make up 
the 3-year-old division's second echelon. 
</P>
<P>
Dancing Spree probably cost his more highly regarded stablemate, Seeking the 
Gold, a victory in the Metropolitan Handicap. While they battled down the 
stretch, Proper Reality came through on the rail and beat them both in a 
three-horse photo finish. 
</P>
<P>
Awe Inspiring, good enough to finish third in the Kentucky Derby and fourth in 
the Belmont besides winning the Jersey Derby, is another McGaughey horse who's 
been unlucky. Scheduled to go to Chicago to run in this Saturday's Arlington 
Classic, Awe Inspiring has remained in New York, where he suffered a minor 
injury this week. There was a storm at Belmont Park; Awe Inspiring reared in 
his stall and was injured. 
</P>
<P>
With Easy Goer out of the Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park on July 29, 
King Glorious, the winner of the Ohio Derby and a horse who has lost only once 
in his life, becomes the major contender. At 1 1/8 miles, the Haskell is well 
within the capabilities of King Glorious, whose stamina has been questioned at 
longer distances. 
</P>
<P>
Music Merci, a distant third in the St. Paul Derby, becomes a viable candidate 
for the Haskell with Easy Goer not running. Trainer Craig Lewis' other option 
is to stay home and try to beat Sunday Silence at 1 1/4 miles in the Swaps at 
Hollywood Park a week from Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Some thoroughbred horsemen reluctantly went along with Hollywood Park in 
switching its day card to night on July 21, when the track will honor Bill 
Shoemaker, who will retire early next year. 
</P>
<P>
The quarter-horse trainers at Los Alamitos didn't get a vote, but many of them 
are unhappy because July 21 is the same night they're running the Los Alamitos 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, Hollywood Park is competing with itself that night, since the track 
also owns Los Alamitos. Last year, when Hollywood ran a special night program 
to mark its 50th anniversary, business was off about 10% at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
Both thoroughbred and quarter-horse trainers are concerned that these two night 
programs could lead to regular evening racing at Hollywood Park. Bay Meadows, 
which opens next month, will feature twilight racing on Fridays and apparently 
needs no special permission from the California Horse Racing Board, which views 
a dinner-time first post as daytime racing. 
</P>
<P>
The quarter-horse trainers would be opposed to competing against the 
thoroughbreds on a regular basis; thoroughbred trainers are against night 
racing because it would mean longer hours and the hiring of extra help. 
</P>
<P>
Twilight racing would be better for many fans at Hollywood Park, because they 
wouldn't have to face rush-hour traffic after the last race. On a weekday, a 
trip across town after Hollywood's last race can take as long as 90 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
When the state lottery began in Kentucky this year, there was a tie-in with the 
Kentucky Derby, so the advertising agency that had the account developed a 
television commercial with a horse-farm theme. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky traditionalists had a difficult time swallowing the fact that the spot 
featured a corny "talking" horse, but they were more indignant because the 
commercial had been obviouslyfilmed at a farm outside Kentucky. The footage was 
shot in Ocala, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
The spot also identified the horse as a Kentucky Derby winner, which was only 
close. Laser Light, the horse used in the commercial, finished second to Gato 
Del Sol in the 1982 Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
Goodbye Halo, who has finished second to Bayakoa three straight times, will try 
to turn the tables Saturday in the $200,000 Vanity Handicap at 1 1/8 miles at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Bayakoa will carry 125 pounds, three more than Goodbye Halo, and not many other 
fillies or mares are expected to challenge them. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Ruhlmann is expected to be the starting high weight, at 122 pounds, 
in the $300,000 Bel Air Handicap at a mile. Laffit Pincay, Hollywood's leading 
rider, has a chance to sweep the weekend while riding both Bayakoa and 
Ruhlmann. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Hilco Scamper, the 6-year-old thoroughbred sprinter who has been running 
against quarter horses this season at Los Alamitos, won his first race there by 
capturing last Saturday's Jeep Challenge Handicap -- an 870-yard race -- by a 
neck. Gary Stevens came over from Hollywood Park for the mount. . . . Gorgeous' 
victory in the Hollywood Oaks came at the right time. Her dam, Kamar, has a 
filly by Danzig who will be sold at Keeneland later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar will offer two triples when the season opens on July 26. There will be 
a triple on the third, fourth and fifth races and fans will also have the 
chance to pick the winners of the sixth, seventh and eighth races. . . . Forest 
Fealty, who ran seventh as the favorite in last Saturday's Landaluce at 
Hollywood, has been sidelined because of a shin injury. . . . Philadelphia 
Park, part of the struggling racing empire of Robert Brennan, has been sold for 
$63 million to an English group that hopes to use the track as the flagship for 
an off-track betting network in Pennsylvania.

COOK WELCOMES CHANCE TO START WITH SAINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDAN HEALEY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is one Cook who doesn't mind turning up the heat, both on himself and on 
his team. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my third season. I feel I should start. They need to have me on the 
field," said Toi Cook, who starred at Montclair Prep and now plays for the New 
Orleans Saints. 
</P>
<P>
As a veteran vying to become the starting right cornerback, Cook knows that the 
trick is to keep the heat on without getting burned. 
</P>
<P>
"I can make the big plays. If I don't start, it's no one's fault but mine. I'm 
going in as the starter; I intend to come out as the starter for the next four 
or five years and hopefully mix in a few Pro Bowls," he said. "You give me a 
chance to play, and in the end you'll be very happy." 
</P>
<P>
After two years as a reserve, Cook is slated to start, but he might have 
ruffled some feathers by moving back to his Westwood condo midway through 
voluntary workouts this spring. The sultry Southern summer can get a little 
slow for a guy used to the L. A. cool of the fast lane. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, I think they're mad at me," Cook said of the Saints' management. "I 
love playing in New Orleans. I'm totally happy with playing there, but I'm not 
from the South. I don't want to live there in the off-season." 
</P>
<P>
In coming back to California, Cook returned to the site of his prep and college 
exploits. A three-sport athlete at Montclair Prep, Cook was an All-Southern 
Section selection three times in both football and baseball and helped his 
basketball team to a Southern Section championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Cook matriculated to Stanford after his Montclair Prep career and started in 
baseball and football there. As a senior he helped Stanford to the Gator Bowl 
in football and the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. baseball championship. 
</P>
<P>
Cook (5-foot-11, 188 pounds) has split his summer workouts between Southern 
California and Stanford in preparation for the beginning of training camp July 
21. While playing pickup basketball recently in Palo Alto, Cook was kneed in 
the calf by former Stanford football teammate Garin Veris, who plays defensive 
end for the Patriots, but he is otherwise healthy and eager to put on the pads. 
</P>
<P>
"I get fired up just thinking about going to training camp," Cook said. "I'm a 
big Raider fan, but I love playing for the Saints. We've got the Dome, great 
fans, the black uniforms and a great defense." 
</P>
<P>
After joining the Saints as an eighth-round draft choice in 1987, Cook has 
steadily moved up the depth chart. He recorded his first interception last year 
and played in every game. He was also one of 37 players the Saints protected 
under the free agency system. 
</P>
<P>
Having played mainly on special teams and gimmick defenses during his first two 
seasons, Cook now figures he is finished with that nickle-and-dime stuff. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, when I first came to college, I just wanted to play pro ball. Now 
there are things I want, and to obtain them I need money," Cook said. "By the 
time I'm 30 I definitely want to be worth a million, and it all hinges on my 
ability to play the sport." 
</P>
<P>
Cook began planning for his future even before he declared a communications 
major at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to get into TV," he said. "I think what I want to do is take Ahmad 
Rashad's route. I think I can broadcast two sports. From there, I want to go to 
the movies. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to have a Ronnie Lott career football-wise and an Ahmad Rashad career 
broadcast-wise."

John Tomac, a Chatsworth cyclist who was among the favorites in the men's 
individual time trial at the U. S. National Cycling Championships, finished 
ninth in Wednesday's race, 1 minute, 33 seconds behind winner Nathan Sheafor. 
</P>
<P>
John Wordin of West Hills finished 14th, 2 minutes, 33 seconds behind Sheafor, 
a Boulder, Colo., competitor who was not listed among the seeded riders. 
</P>
<P>
Sheafor brushed aside rainy weather and slick streets to finish the 24.8-mile 
course in 49:54. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Copeland of Cary, N.C., placed second in 49:59, the only other rider in the 
field of 143 to finish in less than 50 minutes. Kent Bostick, of Albuquerque, 
N.M., was third in 50:20. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty nervous. I didn't know what to expect," said Sheafor, who 
finished second in the event in 1985. "I rode in the rain after the first three 
miles. The course was very slick. I almost fell and crashed into a wall." 
</P>
<P>
John Frey, the defending champion, was the final entrant to begin the course 
and rode in the worst conditions. 
</P>
<P>
Despite falling at the turnaround, he still placed 12th in 51:57. 
</P>
<P>
Wordin said he was encouraged by his ride, despite the miserable conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"It was absolutely the most brutal time-trial course I've ever raced on," 
Wordin said. 
</P>
<P>
Jeanne Golay of Hollywood, Fla., third overall in the recent Tour of Texas, won 
the early 47-rider women's division in 54:51. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Marshall of Albuquerque, who holds the national time-trial record of 
54:27, placed second in 54:56. Marion Clignet of Bethesda, Md., finished third 
in 55:56. 
</P>
<P>
Defending women's champion Phyllis Hines of Atlanta missed the event because 
she is competing in the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
Dara Rogers of Van Nuys was eighth, 4:13 behind Golay. 
</P>
<P>
After a rest day today, the men's and women's divisions will resume racing 
Friday with the team time trials, also in Coalville.

Relaxing in his government class at Mira Costa High, away from his duties as 
boys' basketball coach, Glenn Marx typifies the laid-back image of the 
Manhattan Beach school. 
</P>
<P>
Trim and tanned, he looks younger than his 38 years. His casual attire of white 
polo shirt and gray slacks is consistent with the beach life style. 
</P>
<P>
But looks can be deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody once said I make Bobby Knight look like Snow White," said Marx, 
revealing a side of himself that contradicts his personable demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
Coaching colleagues and former players are familiar with Marx's darker side. 
They describe him as demanding, disciplined and driven. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps that explains how Marx, at 27, earned South Bay Coach of the Year 
honors in 1979 after guiding St. Bernard to the Southern Section 4-A semifinals 
and laying the foundation for a dynasty that continued through the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
His background might explain why people believe Marx can turn around a Mira 
Costa basketball program that has experienced more failures than successes in 
the past decade. The Mustangs were 18-47 in the past three years under three 
different coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Marx, a graduate of North Hollywood High and Cal State Northridge, acknowledges 
that it will take more than a strong personality to build a winner. 
</P>
<P>
"The brash, egotistical Larry Brown image is something I'd rather not be stuck 
with," he said, referring to the nomadic coach of the San Antonio Spurs. "I'm 
more interested in what we're trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
Although he has been a coaching maverick, working at four high schools and 
three Division I colleges in the past 11 years, Marx says he has no intention 
of making a quick exit from Mira Costa. 
</P>
<P>
He left an assistant coaching position at the University of Hawaii to take over 
the Mustang program last October, two months before the season started. Since 
then, he has worked diligently to implement a state-of-the-art conditioning 
program and persuade as many boys as possible to come out for basketball. 
</P>
<P>
Marx is already beginning to see dividends this summer. The Mustangs split two 
games in the L. A. Games and opened the St. Bernard summer league last week 
with a victory over Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's had a good impact," Redondo Coach Steve Shaw said. "I think 
they're going to have a solid program in the next couple of years. He has some 
good young kids and he's doing good things with them." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw witnessed a giant leap in Mira Costa's improvement last February when the 
Mustangs upset Redondo, 43-42, on a last-second, three-point shot in the 
regular-season finale. The loss knocked Redondo from second to third in the 
Ocean League and left Mira Costa with a 7-15 record. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've ever been more thrilled in my life than when we beat 
Redondo," Marx said. 
</P>
<P>
This from a man who has coached and scouted on the major-college level and, 
through his affiliation with all-star teams, has worked with many of the 
nation's finest young players. 
</P>
<P>
After years of chasing the gold ring, Marx says he's settling down. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to get tenure," he said. "I want to buy (property) in the South Bay 
area. I've seen. I've traveled. I've coached basketball in three different 
countries. I've coached on most levels. I'm the best teaching coach I've been. 
I have the best perspective I've had and I'm really enjoying myself." 
</P>
<P>
Bob Mandeville, who played basketball for Marx at Notre Dame High and is now 
the school's baseball coach, says it is difficult not to have an opinion about 
his former mentor. 
</P>
<P>
"Glenn Marx was always in the spotlight as far as controversy," he said. 
"Either you liked him or you disliked him. There's no happy medium with the 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
Marx is still trying to live down an incident that occurred during his first 
season at Notre Dame in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
After a win at Daniel Murphy High, Marx confronted a referee and was assessed 
six technical fouls, according to Jay Privman, who covered the game for the 
Daily News. Murphy's best shooter made 11 of 12 free throws (two per technical) 
to reverse the decision. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame protested the game and was eventually awarded the victory. But 
publicity from the incident proved damaging for Marx. He was suspended for the 
remainder of the season pending an investigation by the Catholic Athletic Assn. 
Notre Dame, ranked second in the Southern Section 4-A Division behind Inglewood 
at the time, finished a disappointing third in the Del Rey League. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he went after the referee to voice his opinion," Mandeville said. "I'm 
a referee, and it happens (to me) after every game. I believe to this day that 
the referee overreacted." 
</P>
<P>
Marx said the incident, which was distributed over the news wire services, was 
blown out of proportion by the media. He said the junior varsity coach was 
assessed three technicals, but that Marx was credited with all of them because 
he refused to talk to reporters after the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no comment," he said. "So they figured I got them all." 
</P>
<P>
Marx admits he has always been an emotional coach during games, although he 
says he has mellowed over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm kind of aggressive. It's kind of a Rick Pitino-type of enthusiasm," he 
said, referring to the fiery coach who recently took over the Kentucky 
basketball program. "I don't sit there with my legs crossed when I coach." 
</P>
<P>
Redondo's Shaw was only aware of Marx's reputation before last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I had heard that he was pretty wild and could really go off," he said, "but he 
was very calm and under control." 
</P>
<P>
Mandeville says Marx struck an intimidating figure when he took over the Notre 
Dame program after coaching St. Bernard for three years. 
</P>
<P>
"At first you fear what's going to happen to you," he said. "Then you realize 
he's making you a better player. I remember him coming down on Saturdays and 
working with me. He showed quite a commitment. I was very appreciative for what 
he did." 
</P>
<P>
Marx returned to Notre Dame in 1981 and coached the team to the Del Rey League 
championship and the second round of the playoffs. The Knights were led by 
Nigel Miguel, who went on to play at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
Two years earlier, Marx worked with another talented group of players at St. 
Bernard. The Vikings featured four future Division I players -- Butch Hays 
(Cal), Lance Washington (Utah State), Michael Gerren (South Alabama) and Billy 
Knox (St. Mary's) -- and they helped put St. Bernard on the basketball map by 
reaching the 4-A semifinals at the Long Beach Arena. 
</P>
<P>
St. Bernard Coach Jim McClune, an assistant under Marx at the Playa del Rey 
school, remembers the transition the players had to make when Marx arrived. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the kids had ever played for anybody as demanding as Glenn," he 
said. "It was a period of adjustment, but I really think that the kids 
responded to him. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a very demanding guy to work for. We had our run-ins, but I think the 
best testimony is that we're pretty good friends now after 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, Marx says he might have put too much emphasis on winning early in 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was starting out, I thought basketball was the only thing that existed 
at the school I was at," he said. "A lot of times people play on your ego. They 
say, 'Oh, you've done such a great job.' One of my biggest regrets at St. 
Bernard is that I think I was given too much credit for the rather quick 
emergence of the basketball program." 
</P>
<P>
He says that it gave him a false sense of importance. 
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate what I have now," he said. "Before, I didn't realize." 
</P>
<P>
The last time Mira Costa boasted a big-name player was in 1984, when 6-foot-10 
Eric Leckner blossomed under the tutelage of former Coach Jim Nielsen. 
</P>
<P>
Leckner went on to star at Wyoming and now plays for the Utah Jazz of the 
National Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Marx doesn't know if he has any players of Leckner's caliber, but he says the 
cupboard is no longer bare at Mira Costa. 
</P>
<P>
"I predict that in two years we'll have seven players over 6-foot-5," he said. 
"We have many young kids who are 6-2 and 6-3 with size 15 feet." 
</P>
<P>
The best of the youngsters is Chris Davis, a 6-foot-6 1/2 forward who will be a 
junior next fall. Davis blocked seven shots in the first half of Mira Costa's 
win over Mayfair in the L. A. Games and will be a mid- to high-level Division I 
prospect by the time he is a senior, Marx said. 
</P>
<P>
The coach is also excited about the futures of two other juniors -- 6-foot-4 
Scott Letourneau and 6-foot-5 Brent Cashin -- and several promising sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
There seems to be no end to Mira Costa's sudden wealth of young basketball 
talent. But Marx says that helping his players improve physically and 
academically is just as important as seeing them develop on the court. 
</P>
<P>
Under the supervision of Marv Marinovich, a well-known strength and muscle 
development coach who has worked with professional athletes, Marx has 
implemented a conditioning regimen that incorporates the latest techniques in 
weight training, running and jumping. Marinovich has used the techniques with 
his son, Todd, a candidate to replace Rodney Peete as quarterback at USC. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a lot of 14- and 15-year-old skinny kids who, if they were to play 
against a Morningside or somebody in our league, would be marginally 
competitive right now," Marx said. "But continuing this program for a period of 
time, they'll all of a sudden be 6-6 17-year-olds who have been through two 
years of intense weight training." 
</P>
<P>
Marx predicts that Mira Costa, which finished sixth out of eight teams in the 
Ocean League last season, will contend for a playoff berth next year and the 
league title the following season. 
</P>
<P>
Another reason for optimism is the cooperation between the basketball team and 
Mira Costa's highly successful volleyball program. Marx says there was one 
volleyball player competing in basketball when he started coaching at the 
school. Now there are nine. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon Ceman, a forward for the basketball team and an All-Southern Section 
setter in volleyball, has noticed a difference in the basketball program since 
Marx replaced Bruce Colin, who did not return after the Mustangs went 4-16 in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot more intensity and desire to win," the 6-foot-5 senior said . 
"We're taking more steps toward conditioning and improving our athletic 
ability. (Marx is) more dedicated to victory. He knows how to run practices and 
get the most out of his players." 
</P>
<P>
Marx also wants his players to get the most out of their studies. 
</P>
<P>
"We have tutoring within our program, where our seniors have tutored our 
sophomores and freshmen," he said. "We have a brand new team room that Jim 
Nielsen developed and we've furnished. I'm encouraging the players to use it 
for studying." 
</P>
<P>
Marx said a Scholastic Aptitude Test preparation video will be available to the 
school's athletes next year. 
</P>
<P>
"What we did at St. Bernard is what we're trying to do here," he said. "Those 
kids not only went on to do well athletically, but do well in college. And 
that's been a big focus here. We want to get the kids who are dedicated 
basketball players to concentrate on their academics." 
</P>
<P>
Why Mira Costa? 
</P>
<P>
Marx says he is frequently asked that question. 
</P>
<P>
It is a natural inquiry, considering the other schools where he has worked. 
After his stint at Notre Dame High, he got a taste of the Ivy League as a 
full-time assistant for one season at Brown University in Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
He returned to the Southland upon the death of his father and served as coach 
for three years at Los Amigos High in Fountain Valley. Next he became an 
off-campus assistant under George Raveling at USC while he taught at Mira Costa 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
When an assistant position at Hawaii opened up the following year, it gave the 
bachelor yet another opportunity to expand his coaching horizons. 
</P>
<P>
He has coached 19 players who have gone on to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
So, why come to basketball-poor Mira Costa? 
</P>
<P>
"There are some stereotypes about Mira Costa and certain beach schools that I 
think are invalid," he said. "Corona del Mar (in Newport Beach) this year made 
the CIF finals in basketball, football, volleyball and tennis. What we would 
like to see here is a Rolling Hills, Palos Verdes-type of program where every 
year we are very competitive. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing you have to do is get the kids in your school out for 
basketball. I think a lot of people recruit from the outside and have success 
with that, although I hate to say it. But I think what you really need to do is 
recruit from within. Get a volleyball kid out. Get a water polo kid out. Get a 
football kid out. And then coach them."

COOL GOALIE AND TORRID BLAZERS DOUSE FLAMES IN THE 14TH FIREMEN'S HOCKEY 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK WAGNER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A longtime firefighter and still, at 44, a hockey goalie, Spence Waldo looms in 
both roles as a mysterious heroic figure, masked and helmeted as he faces the 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the Southern California Blazers -- a team of firefighters from Los 
Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and San Diego counties -- Waldo guarded the 
nets Tuesday night as the Blazers played the San Francisco Flames in their 14th 
annual Firemen's Hockey Championship at Iceland Arena in Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
The three-game tournament, which concludes tonight at 7:30, has in the last 10 
years raised more than $100,000 for the Canoga Park-based Alisa Ann Ruch 
California Burn Foundation, a nonprofit group that offers burn-prevention 
education in schools and assists burn victims and their families. 
</P>
<P>
Before joining the Blazers 17 years ago, Waldo had never skated. "But I had a 
knack for (playing goal) and I thought it was fun," he said last week at 
practice, his forehead sweaty even in the arena's frigid air. "And the guys 
would ask me to do it. They said, 'If you play goalie, you don't have to pay 
dues.' " 
</P>
<P>
As it's turned out, Waldo, who lives in Lakewood and works at the Long Beach 
harbor, has paid his dues anyway. Pucks have left their imprint on various 
parts of his body, and, while playing in a tournament in Canada two years ago, 
he suffered a torn hamstring and torn knee ligaments. As a firefighter, he's 
had only a few pulled muscles and some minor burns. 
</P>
<P>
"Butterflies already," Waldo says an hour before the game Tuesday night. "I 
don't know if I can play a whole game, it's so hot." 
</P>
<P>
At 7:30 he goes into the dressing room where his uniform and equipment have 
been laid neatly on the floor by his 11-year-old son, Tyde: socks, pants, 
skates, gloves, protective cup, pads of various thicknesses, an orange jersey 
with 00 on the back and the mask that looked suitable for Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
"Spencer, come on buddy, this is it," defenseman Rich Grimm says to Waldo as 
the goalie rubs himself with liniment. 
</P>
<P>
When he has pulled everything on, Waldo stretches. "The gladiator going out to 
the coliseum," he says. And then he waddles out the door. 
</P>
<P>
Before a noisy packed crowd that chanted, "L.A., L.A.," in an arena deorated 
with "Go Blazers," "Beat Frisco" and beer signs, Waldo spears a hard shot with 
his glove on his first save opportunity in the opening period. Then, with the 
fast-skating Blazers leading, 1-0, he makes a kneeling save. Just when it 
appears he won't get any more action, he is elbowed to the ice by a charging 
Tom Alexander of San Francisco, who is called for a penalty. Waldo bounces up 
and watches the ensuing power play, on which Gerry O'Hagan scores on a slap 
shot to make the score 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
Between periods, while his teammates talk excitedly in the front of the 
dressing room, Waldo smokes a cigarette and sits in the rear, alone. 
</P>
<P>
Although Waldo -- also the goalie for the Phantoms and Lancers, amateur teams 
in Paramount -- won't be confused with a National Hockey League goalie, his 
competitiveness and desire to improve have made him a creditable amateur. 
</P>
<P>
"He's enthusiastic, and enthusiasm means a lot at this level," Art Brewster, 
the Blazers' 73-year-old coach, said last week. "You can count on him. He's a 
good goalie who doesn't let a game get out of hand. He's got that mental 
attitude of a winner. An excellent team man, everybody loves him." 
</P>
<P>
Waldo, without an idea what his goals-against average might be because no one 
keeps statistics, has long wondered how he would fare as a professional. 
"Everybody dreams of playing at least one game in the pros to see what it's 
like," he said. "I go out to a Kings game and sit down by the ice and see that 
it's a whole different world. I think I'm all right for our caliber of play but 
(NHL goalies) are superhuman. You can't even see the puck, and those guys are 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
At the side of the rink during the recent practice, Waldo's family -- wife 
Shzelle, sons Tyde and Keane, 7, and daughter Fawna, 3 -- watched their hero. 
</P>
<P>
"I think what he does is fantastic, I'm real proud of him," Shzelle said. She 
worries about Waldo getting hurt playing hockey but "not like when he's out on 
the job." 
</P>
<P>
Tyde, a hockey player himself, yelled out at his father: "Watch the back door." 
</P>
<P>
"He turns too much and faces the guy who has the puck, and doesn't watch the 
back door," the youngster explained. 
</P>
<P>
Having never had formal coaching, Waldo's approach is basic: "I try to figure 
out where the puck is going and get in between it (and the goal)." 
</P>
<P>
Goaltending's individuality appeals to Waldo, who also pitches on the 
39-and-over firefighter's softball team and placekicks in the annual 
firefighter-police football game. 
</P>
<P>
"I do my own thing, and since there are not too many on the team who know what 
goaltending is about, they don't yell at me," he said. "You're either a hero or 
a goat. You get slapped on the back or ignored." 
</P>
<P>
As Waldo had hoped, his teammates keep the puck at the opposite end of the rink 
during most of the second period. But penalties suddenly plague the Blazers and 
Mike Domeier of the Flames shoots the puck in the net with 6:54 left. After two 
periods, the Blazers' lead is down to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
"I was screened, I never saw it," Waldo says of the shot while watching the 
Zamboni machine smooth the ice for the third period. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent afternoon at the four-man fire station that serves the harbor area, 
Capt. Al Chronister described Waldo, a Los Angeles native and a firefighter for 
20 years, as "a very quiet man who knows his job and does more than his share." 
</P>
<P>
Off his skates and out of his bulky gear, Waldo looked much smaller, although 
he is a firmly built man of nearly six feet and 180 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Because of his profession and sports participation, he is a double hero to his 
children. On fire safety days, he goes to their schools and, in full gear, puts 
on demonstrations. "They think it's a big deal, and say, 'That's my dad.' " 
Waldo said. 
</P>
<P>
Tyde sometimes spends the night at the fire station, where his father is used 
to waking abruptly, jumping into his boots and the rest of his cumbersome 
"uniform" and, in seconds, climbing aboard a polished lime-colored truck. 
Because the modern building has only one story, there is no pole to slide down. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a good job," Waldo said. "Fires are always exciting, especially if you 
can see the flames and smoke while you're driving up. Every day there is 
something different. When you see all the stuff out there, all the tragedies, 
you learn how to put it in perspective. You don't forget it but you don't dwell 
on it. You get shook up seeing something (happen to a) kid; that really gets to 
you." 
</P>
<P>
And he recalled a time when he gave mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a baby in a 
police car en route to a hospital. But the baby, who had strangled on a toy, 
could not be revived. "I thought he was coming back," 
</P>
<P>
He thinks more about pressure when he's in goal than when he's on the job. "In 
firefighting you don't think about it, you're trained to do it," he said. "You 
have a captain and a chief, they point and you go. You don't think about it 
until afterward. In the (hockey) tournament there's pressure because of the 
people. It's the biggest crowd anyone has played before." 
</P>
<P>
With 13:04 left in the game, Rick Moreno scores to give the Blazers a 3-1 lead. 
As three Flames bear down on him, their skates squawking, Waldo stands his 
ground and kicks away the shot. With 2:49 left, Aldo Bevilacqua scores a final 
Southern California goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Blazers win, 4-1. In the tradition of hockey, they skate to the goal and 
congratulate Waldo. 
</P>
<P>
Though he was not under heavy pressure most of the game, he has done what he 
had to, and is a hero. 
</P>
<P>
He congratulates the Flames, then skates to the side of the rink and says to 
Shzelle, "This one's for you, hon."

VOGES QUALIFIES FOR MATCH PLAY IN LA JOLLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Mitch Voges of Simi Valley became the No. 2 qualifier for match play in the 
86th Trans-Mississippi Amateur Golf championship Wednesday, shooting a 
3-over-par 75 at La Jolla Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
Voges, 39, shot an opening-round 73 on Tuesday and was tied with three other 
golfers, three strokes behind leader Pat Duncan of Rancho Santa Fe, who opened 
with a round of 70. 
</P>
<P>
Voges' 75 on Wednesday gave him a 148 total, one stroke behind qualifying 
leader Jack Spradlin of San Diego, who had rounds of 73 and 74 for a 147 total. 
Duncan struggled to a 79 on Wednesday and was the No. 3 qualifier with a 
36-hole score of 149. 
</P>
<P>
Match play was scheduled to begin this morning among the 64 golfers -- from a 
field of 156 -- who survived the cut. The qualifiers will play 18 holes today, 
36 on Friday and 36 more on Saturday. The 18-hole championship match between 
the two finalists will be played Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Voges, a regional manager for a carpet company, was nearly forced to give up 
golf five years ago when he sustained ruptured disks in his back. But surgeons 
removed two of the damaged disks and fused the spinal cord back together. Voges 
resumed his golfing career less than a year later. RICH TOSCHES

PANORAMA CITY WINS EASTERN DIVISION TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Cascione singled to score Dave Garcia in the bottom of the eighth inning 
Wednesday at Poly High as Panorama City rallied to defeat Sun Valley, 6-5, and 
clinch the District 20 Eastern Division title. 
</P>
<P>
Panorama City (16-4), which trailed, 4-0, after 4 1/2 innings, rallied for two 
runs in the fifth inning and three runs in the sixth to forge a 5-5 tie. 
</P>
<P>
In the eighth, Roland De La Maza hit a leadoff double and Garcia was walked 
intentionally. Shane Wight followed with a single, but De La Maza was thrown 
out trying to score. 
</P>
<P>
Cascione followed with a hit to score Garcia from third. 
</P>
<P>
De La Maza (6-0) pitched three innings in relief to earn the win. 
</P>
<P>
In other District 20 games: 
</P>
<P>
Woodland Hills West 8, West Hills 4 -- Woodland Hills West scored four runs 
with two out in the third inning to erase a 2-1 deficit and roll to a Western 
Division win at Chaminade High. 
</P>

YOUR COINS: COLLECTING IS NOT THE SAME AS INVESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON ALPERT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: I'm new to numismatics and want to know the best way to get my feet 
wet without wasting money on coins with little or no collector value. -- J.L.M. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: You sound more like an investor than a collector. There's nothing wrong 
with that, as long as you know what your goals and objectives are. The main 
difference between collecting and investing is that collecting can be a lot 
more fun. Even so, it's possible to make a profit either way. Collectors, 
however, usually purchase coins that interest them because of their beauty, 
design or historical significance. Investors will buy anything that they 
believe will appreciate in value. 
</P>
<P>
First and foremost, arm yourself with knowledge. Along these lines is the 
just-available 12th edition of "High Profits From Rare Coin Investment" by Q. 
David Bowers. It contains price data and performance charts for the investor. 
The book is $14.95 plus $2 for handling from Bowers and Merena Publications, 
Box 1224, Wolfeboro, N.H. 03894. Another good reference is "The Coin Collectors 
Survival Manual" by Scott A. Travers, published by Prentice Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond this, the biggest breakthrough in numismatics recently has been grading 
services, which authenticate, grade and permanently seal coins in tamper-proof 
plastic holders. Since grading is a key element in determining value, this has 
helped take the guesswork out of pricing. Other pricing factors are rarity, eye 
appeal and collector interest, which can be fickle, shifting from silver 
dollars to gold pieces to commemoratives to type coins. 
</P>
<P>
Also, it is important to establish a good rapport with a dealer who can offer 
advice and guidance. Predicting the coin market is as tricky as predicting the 
stock, bond and commodity markets. In fact, coins are now being offered by some 
stock brokerage firms, which means that more and more investment dollars will 
enter the numismatic market. This will most likely boost the value of 
high-quality coins, which are the most desirable to collectors and investors 
alike.

JAMES LAUGHLIN: FROM MAN OF STEEL TO A MAN OF LETTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>

Random Essays by James Laughlin (Moyer Bell: $18.95) 271 pages) 
</P>
<P>
After James Laughlin, playing hooky from Harvard in the 1930s, had spent a year 
at Ezra Pound's "Ezraversity" in Rapallo -- this amounted to paying for his 
lunches and dinners with Pound and drinking the master's words in free -- the 
poet gave him some advice. 
</P>
<P>
The young man should give up his attempts to become a writer. He should return 
to Harvard to please his parents and enlist their cooperation -- he was a 
Laughlin of Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel -- in setting up as a publisher. "To 
publish him and his friends," Laughlin notes in one of these essays. 
</P>
<P>
It was excellent advice. Laughlin started New Directions with a commitment to 
publish modernist literature -- a commitment honorably and sometimes 
brilliantly maintained from the late 1930s to this day. Among many other 
things, ND published 24 of Pound's books and 19 by William Carlos Williams. 
Laughlin is justifiably proud of this; he is equally proud that -- contrary to 
the practicalities of publishing -- all but one of these are still in print. 
</P>
<P>
The pieces collected here -- talks and essays delivered or written over the 
past 50 years -- offer a second reason for esteeming Pound's advice. Laughlin 
made the best possible use of his family money. He had a publisher's 
temperament; he did not have a writer's. To publish the avant-garde, openness 
is more important than discrimination, curiosity more than judgment, a roving 
eye more than a precise one. 
</P>
<P>
In a writer, on the other hand, such a balance is apt to lead to pretty soft 
work. A lot of the writing here is soft, which is not to say that it lacks 
value. Laughlin's literary opinions are gentlemanly; they range between 
sensible and silly. What shines through is his kindness and civility, his 
individuality, and the joy he took in his authors. 
</P>
<P>
He is not enough of a writer to be able to create a portrait from scratch. He 
has an essay on Wayne Andrews, a polymathic and appealingly eccentric 
architecture writer, curator, editor and professor. He also wrote, as Montagu 
O'Reilly, a work of deadpan, possibly Dadaist humor entitled "Who Has Been 
Tampering With These Pianos?" Laughlin gives us a series of engaging hints; we 
don't really get a picture. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the time he spent with Pound, Williams and Gertrude Stein 
allows him to add some nicely provocative touches to their well-established 
images. 
</P>
<P>
We hear Pound mischievously commenting on T. S. Eliot's "Low Saurian Vitality." 
We hear him reproaching Laughlin for going skiing when he ought to be out 
selling Pound's work. "You spend three-quarters of your time sliding down 
ice-cream cones on a tea tray." 
</P>
<P>
When Laughlin writes of a posh ski trip where he ripped his pants and had them 
sewn up on the slopes by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, Pound urges him 
to follow up by sending her "Ta Hio," his book on Confucianism. Laughlin did, 
but got no response from the Dutch court, not known for its interest in the 
avant-garde. 
</P>
<P>
When a French professor recommended him to Stein, she wired back: "Can he type 
-- will he work?" He could and did. He spent time at Stein's country place in 
France, writing press releases for her forthcoming U.S. lecture tour, and 
changing flat tires in the course of their automobile excursions. He writes a 
Stein-influenced sentence describing her sitting in her garden, back to the 
view, accompanied by her dogs. 
</P>
<P>
"Miss Stein spent a lot of time meditating in her deck chair. She could 
meditate with either one dog or both. Being a genius entailed much meditation." 
</P>
<P>
To Williams, he gave his greatest affection. We get the impression that nothing 
has made him prouder than publishing "Paterson," volume by volume, over 12 
years of painful composition. His account of the composition and his thoughts 
about the poem provide the finest and most disciplined writing in the 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, he tells us, "was one of the most lovable and admirable human beings 
I have ever encountered. . . . Over the years I came to think of him as the 
'non-cutaneous man,' one who had no skin or any barrier between himself and 
others." 
</P>
<P>
It seems like a good description of Laughlin himself. At times, he strikes us 
as an innocent abroad in the world of letters. Writing of his writers, he 
evinces not so much a temperamental affinity as an emotional one. It is as if 
Count Razumovsky had written his recollections of Beethoven -- slightly 
incongruous, but valuable to read.

PERESTROIKA REUNION AT BOWL OPENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, Times Music Critic 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No floating barrage of balloons punctuated the introductory flourishes at the 
official opening of the Hollywood Bowl season Tuesday night. The sky remained 
empty. Convention was scorned. 
</P>
<P>
A slip in the program magazine explained that the festive ritual of hot air and 
rubber was being abandoned "because of dangers to the ecology and environment." 
Very sensible. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the powers behind the symphonies under the stars offered a subtle 
celebration of perestroika. It began with a very ponderous, very solemn, very 
appreciative performance of our national anthem led by Yuri Temirkanov, music 
director of the Leningrad Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
Next the visiting maestro majestically guided the otherwise leaderless Los 
Angeles Philharmonic through Beethoven's "Egmont" Overture. Then came the main 
attraction: Vladimir Feltsman. 
</P>
<P>
Feltsman, you will recall, was a popular pianist in the Soviet Union until 
1979, when he applied for an immigration visa. At that time he became a 
professional nonperson. His engagements were canceled, his recordings 
withdrawn. He endured eight years of artistic isolation before managing to 
leave in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
How, one had to wonder, would this Soviet outcast collaborate with an 
illustrative representative of the current Soviet Establishment? Apparently 
there was no problem. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to formal queries, Feltsman said during intermission that he was 
very happy to be be able to play again under Temirkanov after a 15-year hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
Temirkanov, for his part, was diplomatically enigmatic. "I do not consider 
Feltsman an emigre," he stated. "I just consider him someone who lives 
somewhere else now. I don't worry about where a person lives, only about how he 
plays." 
</P>
<P>
And how did he play on this occasion? Competently. 
</P>
<P>
Some observers have been eager to hail Feltsman as a miraculous fusion of 
Horowitz and Rubinstein. Extra-musical publicity has a curious way of inflating 
expectations and coloring impressions. This observer continues to find him a 
rather stolid musician with a rather solid technique. The magic remains 
elusive. 
</P>
<P>
His performance of the Fourth Beethoven Concerto proved more notable for 
sociopolitical achievement than for specific artistic insight. He approached 
the noble challenge with intelligent restraint. Although he smudged some of the 
bravura passages, he obviously savored the advantage of clarity. 
</P>
<P>
This was a fluent, carefully shaded, eminently coherent interpretation. What it 
lacked, alas, was flair. The lyrical flights did not soar. The dramatic 
outbursts did not roar. The introspective passages did not sigh. Ultimately, 
Feltsman gave us efficient prose but dutiful poetry. 
</P>
<P>
His countryman on the podium provided sensitive, propulsive accompaniment. The 
amplification system provided a raucous acoustical ambience. 
</P>
<P>
Nancy Reagan led an audience of 11,586 in providing hearty applause (while her 
husband worked a ballgame a few miles down the freeway). Perhaps the 
presidential presence represented something of an aesthetic quid pro quo. After 
all, Raisa Gorbachev -- together with her husband -- recently bestowed emphatic 
glasnost approval upon an American pianist in Moscow: Van Cliburn. 
</P>
<P>
After intermission, Temirkanov returned for an obligatory Russian showpiece. 
Ignoring the automatic-pilot system favored by many of his Western colleagues, 
he brought brooding intensity, strident impetuosity and thunderous passion to 
Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony. The rhetoric actually seemed spontaneous. 
</P>
<P>
The pizzicato ostinato of the third movement has seldom sounded so aptly 
casual. The final Allegro con fuoco has seldom sounded so fiery. The 
Philharmonic, which often sleepwalks through this music, responded to 
Temirkanov's precise urgings with extraordinary zeal. 
</P>
<P>
Never underestimate the power of native conviction.

A company featuring American operatic artists has arrived in Beijing to present 
the first prominent American cultural event there since the military crackdown 
on pro-democracy demonstrators last month. Although there is a U.S. travel 
advisory in effect for China, Joann Grillo, managing director of Ambassadors of 
Opera and Concert Worldwide, said, "No one in our government told us not to 
come. In fact, every American embassy and official along the way has encouraged 
us as a step toward friendship and peace." The Ambassadors of Opera and Concert 
Worldwide, an independent company, has staged operas and musicals throughout 
the world since 1983. ALEENE MacMINN

Ilzamar Mendes, the widow of slain Brazilian ecologist Chico Mendes, refuses to 
back away from a movie deal she made with Brazil's J.N. Filmes -- a major 
setback for such big Hollywood names as Robert Redford, David Puttnam and Ted 
Turner, who are pursuing the film rights to Mendes' story. Mendes' widow 
purchased an ad in Monday's Hollywood Reporter defending her deal and warning 
other producers that their continued pursuit of the project "can only hinder 
our fight for the defense of the Amazon forest." However, a lawyer for the 
Chico Mendes Foundation released a statement this week confirming that a 
majority of the foundation's leaders -- who are legally responsible for 
administering the rights to Mendes' story -- rejected the J.N. Filmes deal at a 
July 3 meeting. Despite her claim that she was acting on behalf of the 
foundation, the leaders said that the widow acted "entirely without support or 
approval of the foundation." The story of Chico Mendes, who was murdered 
outside his Brazilian home in December, is one of the most hotly pursued film 
projects in recent Hollywood history. ALEENE MacMINN

STEPPLING'S 'TEENAGE WEDDING': WELL-PACED VIEW OF WASTED LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those who follow Los Angeles theater likely know about playwright-director John 
Steppling and his plays about snubbed, wasted lives. Like any strong-willed 
artist, he has supporters and detractors. The long-held knock against him: 
Snubbed, wasted lives can lead to snubbed, wasted plays. 
</P>
<P>
What has been largely missed in evaluations of Steppling's works (more than a 
dozen in fewer years) is his consistency in exploring facets of his chosen 
world and in refining the steadily paced rhythms of his scenes and language. 
</P>
<P>
It is because of this pacing that Steppling has always insisted on being his 
own director. With his new production, "Teenage Wedding," at the Cast Theatre, 
Steppling's intentions and executions have come to powerful fruition. 
</P>
<P>
His plays are almost always in Los Angeles or the surrounding desert -- the 
artificial and true environments, at war with each other. "Teenage Wedding" is 
situated in a kind of phony ecology: the Salton Sea, now a dying lake formed by 
a Colorado River flood. Dee (Suzanne Fletcher), a woman belonging to an Italian 
drug dealer named Carlo -- women here tend not to lead independent lives -- 
sums up the locale when she remarks that "this is the kind of place that makes 
you forget why you came here." 
</P>
<P>
That is not dramatic writing for people who like their characters to reveal 
themselves primarily through action. But for those who like to listen to 
characters staking out their position in an absurd world (think of Hamlet, or 
Samuel Beckett's people), "Teenage Wedding" provides the genuine article. 
</P>
<P>
Dee's remark also sums up the dilemma of several of the characters here, 
particularly odd since Carlo (Robert Glaudini) and the motel owner he is doing 
business with, Spicy Pabst (Richard Riehle), are deep into a drug deal. This 
requires concentration and follow-through, as Spicy might put it, but the heat 
seems to be dissipating everyone's stamina. 
</P>
<P>
So Steppling carefully unreels a tale of male impotence, structured by a series 
of snapshot scenes. They're not short; in fact, they're longer and more 
developed than in many of his past plays. But given the stark diorama effect of 
Nick Flynn's and Erika M. Brich's fine two-room set, the creepy, dirt-mustard 
tone of Erika Bradberry's lights and Steppling's way of beginning and ending 
scenes in a freeze, we're observers on a world we want to keep a distance from. 
</P>
<P>
This phenomenon is what distinguishes Steppling's work from the bulk of "new, 
original" plays, where the author's yearning for us to identify with the main 
character can verge on a sales pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Spicy Pabst is loathsome, declining from a scummy Oceanside detective to a 
scummier drug trader. But with the sculpted dialogue and Riehle rumbling 
through the part like a hilariously overweight bull in a china shop, Spicy is 
oddly funny in his Hawaiian shirt or talking about golfing at Pebble Beach. 
Trash, but fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
These motel rooms, to be sure, have sympathetic beings in them. Megan Butler's 
Helen has a very felt monologue about how boys in the low Southern California 
desert learn violence. Lola Glaudini's teen-age Debbie is like a small deer 
that has wandered off into coyote country. Jim Storm's Joe is every would-be 
artist who has lost his career track -- the prototypical character from a 
writer who keeps on his own track like a bloodhound. 
</P>
<P>
 At 800 N. El Centro Ave., Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7 p.m., 
through Aug. 6. Tickets: $12-$15; (213) 462-9872.

IMITABLE DAVID SANBORN LIGHTS MUSICAL FIREWORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everywhere you look these days you find David Sanborn. He co-hosts NBC's 
"Sunday Night," which brings jazz and R&amp;B to late-night television. He has 
his own radio program, "The Jazz Show With David Sanborn" (that sadly isn't 
carried in Los Angeles, but is aired in San Diego). And, in addition to his 
recordings, he's made recent guest appearances on albums from performers 
ranging from Eddie Palmieri to Brenda Russell. 
</P>
<P>
Even more prevalent is the Sanborn sound, which has become the model for a 
generation of jazz-fusion alto saxophonists. Though the man modestly claims 
that he's not an innovator, his easily identifiable hard-edged tone and 
emotional way with a solo have been copied by so many musicians that it's no 
longer safe to identify an unseen alto player as Sanborn just because he has 
the Sanborn sound. 
</P>
<P>
The man could be found Tuesday night at the Pacific Amphitheatre, and with so 
many imitators out there, it was good to see the original. His five-piece band 
was tight as a new shoe and, led by bassist Tom Barney, played with a tougher 
sound than heard on the saxophonist's recent albums. The material the group 
performed, much of it composed by Miles Davis collaborator Marcus Miller, 
played to Sanborn's strengths. Funky, R&amp;B-influenced themes allowed the 
saxophonist to climb the scales with excitement before setting off the 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
The set opened with Sanborn quoting from Thelonious Monk's "Well You Needn't" 
as the band broke into the slightly sinister groove of "Run for Cover." Looking 
imperially slim in a blue sport coat and pants, the saxophonist got down to 
what he does best, building his solo quickly out of the middle range before 
spilling his soul in the high end. There was little subtlety in his playing, 
with quick, agile lines leading to a squealing climax. 
</P>
<P>
The pattern continued with what is now a Sanborn standard entitled "Straight to 
the Heart," a tune that began at a ballad pace and built into a moving, 
emotional statement. The strong feelings of Miller's "Blue Beach," which 
featured a heated exchange between drummer Sonny Emory and percussionist Don 
Alias, spilled out into the audience. (One overzealous fan's expressive, 
barely-in-control dancing at his seat led to scuffles with surrounding patrons 
and more scuffling with security, resulting in his ejection from the theater.) 
</P>
<P>
Sanborn varied the pace with "As We Speak" and his own (in conjunction with 
Michael Ruff) "Lesley Ann," both numbers giving him a chance to show a 
thoughtful, more sensitive side. On the latter, guitarist Robben Ford followed 
Sanborn's earlier example, constructing his bluesy solo with chordal pops and 
runs to the high end. 
</P>
<P>
The night's best moments came during King Curtis' "Soul Serenade," a perfect 
vehicle for Sanborn's R&amp;B sensibilities. Keyboardist Ricky Peterson 
switched to organ for the tune, filling his solo with the kind of excitement 
that the late Larry Young brought to the instrument. Ford demonstrated his own 
slow-hand style before trading furious fours with the saxophonist. 
</P>
<P>
The band's scorching encore, "Summer," featured Barney's thumb-heavy bass solo 
and an excursion from Sanborn that was much like the man himself: Busy. 
</P>
<P>
Opening the show was singer Brenda Russell. Russell utilizes a smooth, even 
delivery and doesn't rely on flash or stylistic antics to get her point across. 
She also composes most of her own music, and songs like "This Time I Need 
You"and "Waiting for You" showed she hasa varied sense of rhythm and a good ear 
for melody. 
</P>
<P>
Less successful were the tunes "Stupid Love" and "All American" which were 
pleasantly musical but crippled by inane lyrics. Her rendition of "Get Here," 
the title number from her last album, contained a number of dramatic pauses and 
allowed her to show some range and a pleasingly sensual growl.

THE PAINTER AS PHOTOGRAPHER AT THE GETTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENA DONOHUE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The frontispiece photo for the J. Paul Getty Museum's current exhibition, 
"Experimental Photography: The Painter Photographer," is appropriate: a small 
vintage photo called "The Infant Photography Giving Painting an Additional 
Paint Brush." Created about 1856 by the British Victorian painter Oscar Gustave 
Rejlander, the photograph stages a nude infant, amid classical busts, handing 
an allegorical brush to an artist. 
</P>
<P>
This picture hints at the intrigue and experimental promise that photography 
was to hold for painters and the artistic avant-garde in general. America's 
academy-busting Ash Can School of painting was attracted to photography's 
immediacy and ability to capture candid life, while the ultra-modern Bauhaus in 
Germany stressed a marriage between art and the methods and materials of 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
This fascinating show (through Sept. 17) indicates that once painters (and 
architects and designers) discovered photography, they did not simply use the 
medium to ape the look of painting as the Pictorialists had stressed. These 
painters-turned-photographers had a healthy respect for the medium's special 
identity. Even when photographs were used as studies for paintings -- such as 
Thomas Eakins' beautifully frolicking "Eakins Pupils at the Site for 'Swimming 
Hole' " (1883) -- or as dramatically lit documents of finished sculptures by 
Henry Moore or Constantin Brancusi, they have the formal and technical 
wherewithal to stand as art in their own right. 
</P>
<P>
The most famous painter to take up the camera was Edgar Degas who, with failing 
eyesight in the late 1800s, began to use the camera as well as the pencil to 
record portraits of friends and investigate the interaction of light moving 
over the human form. "After the Bath, Woman Drying Her Back," a bromide print 
from 1898, strikes us as a wholly contemporary Edward Weston image in the way 
that it abstracts the model's body into an anonymous, sensual study of tone and 
texture. Always drawn to the theatrical light of his paintings, Degas pulls his 
sitter's illuminated face and hands out of moody darkness in "Louise Halevy by 
Lamplight" (circa 1895). The same sensitive realism was carried into the 20th 
Century in works like Ben Shahn's poignant 1935 photo of displaced farmers. 
</P>
<P>
If the camera could record reality, it could also distort and redefine it. 
Abstract artist Lazlo Moholy Nagy, who in the '20s was instrumental in pushing 
photography's acceptance as a viable tool in modern art and aesthetics, was 
among the first to use light moving over sensitized photo paper to produce 
"cameraless" photography. In "The Mirror" (1921), he uses light moving over 
shapes to make a constructivist arrangement of discs and planes floating in 
space. Rene Magritte flattens depth in a surreal shot, replacing a man's head 
with a checkerboard, and Man Ray uses complex light effects to create an eerie, 
X-ray nude. 
</P>
<P>
The camera opened new doors for Expressionistic self-portraiture. German artist 
Oskar Schlemmer made a 1925 self-portrait using superimposed negatives that 
present him as a specter haunting studio and desk. A whimsical, self-portrait 
series by Andy Warhol taken at a photo booth captures a boyish charm missing 
from the media persona. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the most interesting photos are those created by artists who worked in 
fields other than painting. Italian film maker Carlo Ludovico Bragaglia 
translated the motion and mechanistic power of Futurist art to photography, and 
the stalwart architectural hand of Frank Lloyd Wright is absent in two photos 
of lyrical, blossoming trees. 
</P>
<P>
It's tough to stand out in such good company, but the exquisite photos of 
architecture and quiet Americana interiors by Precisionist painter Charles 
Sheeler do just that. 
</P>

series. Right, Rene Magritte used a checkerboard to surreal effect, 1937.

PICNICS

There is nothing like a cool-looking, cool-tasting picnic under a hot sun. 
We're talking about ice-cold drinks and refreshing foods that are cool to the 
lips and yummy, besides. Behind the scenes, however, the host-cook wants the 
workload to be as minimal as possible. Who wants to work up a sweat in the heat 
of summer, no matter how much you love your family and guests? I remember a 
hostess who worked so hard on her Hollywood Bowl picnic she was laid up for 2 
1/2 days afterwards from fatigue. Imagine how that made us, her guests, feel. 
</P>
<P>
You want to enjoy the picnic too. You want a menu that is simple, yet 
glamorous, almost work-free. You want it to survive the trek to the picnic site 
and you want to have it served with the least fuss possible. 
</P>
<P>
We've created several menus to keep the cook cool and the guests at ease. 
</P>
<P>
The first menu calls for cold shrimp to use with cocktail sauce. You can buy 
the shrimp already cooked. You can also purchase the cocktail sauce, although 
we heartily recommend our recipe. No cooking there. 
</P>
<P>
The cold beef requires cooking or barbecuing the meat. To avoid last-minute 
work, plan on an extra steak on the fire the next time you barbecue, and freeze 
the steak to use for the picnic salad recipe whenever needed. Slicing the steak 
will be that much easier partially thawed, anyway. You can assemble the 
ingredients in a large covered container and use the same container to toss and 
serve the salad at the picnic. 
</P>
<P>
Dessert is even easier. Store-bought ice cream pops are shipped to the picnic 
in a compact ice cream freezer (frozen overnight). Or you can pack them in dry 
ice, which is available in package form. 
</P>
<P>
The Thai Picnic calls for peanut soup, an easy recipe from a Velvet Turtle 
restaurant that we've used with great success over the years. You can serve it 
cold for a summer picnic and hot in the winter months. Put it in a thermos to 
serve from cups. No spoons necessary here. 
</P>
<P>
The Papaya Stuffed With Curry Chicken can be completely assembled and chilled 
in advance and set on a tray lined with plastic wrap to tote to the picnic. 
We've scattered ice cubes on the tray for a cooling effect once at the picnic. 
All you do is serve each self-contained papaya boat from the tray. The Thai tea 
also is poured from a thermos to serve ice cold with lace cookies, store-bought 
or otherwise. Our recipe is a honey. 
</P>
<P>
In a Caribbean-style menu we chose smoked oysters for appetizers on tortilla 
chips instead of fresh ones for convenience and safety. You can add any 
toppings you desire or the Mexican-style ones suggested on our menu. The 
chicken drumsticks (select nice, fat ones at the market) can be marinated and 
cooked a day in advance since they are served cold, anyway. They will keep just 
fine in the refrigerator until ready to tote. 
</P>
<P>
Rice and beans are served cold as a salad. Use leftover rice and canned beans, 
as we did, or make your own from-scratch beans. This salad too can be prepared 
a day or two ahead. In fact, day-old salad tastes better, because flavors have 
been allowed to develop. 
</P>
<P>
You can serve the chicken and rice in a manner shown here with drumsticks stuck 
into the mounded rice for convenient service, or separately in plastic 
containers. For convenience, the coconut cream can be served from the can in 
which it comes for dipping the medley of fresh finger fruit sticks (it's a 
pretty can and it has a lid) or transferred as we have done in the photograph 
shown. 
</P>
<P>
We stress rice salad for summer picnics because you can use leftover rice from 
an evening meal (make sure you make enough to accommodate the recipe). Rice is 
a hardy food that also travels well. Assemble the rice, shrimp and and other 
ingredients at home and top off the salad with caviar at the picnic. 
</P>
<P>
The Individual Tiramisu (Italian trifle) desserts require no cooking, but they 
should be made no sooner than a day ahead for ultimate freshness, unless 
frozen. 
</P>
<P>

containers with lids to carry to picnic. Completely assemble cold beef salad 
and store in chill-proof container. Toss at the site. 
</P>
<P>
Assorted ice creams or ice pops, such as coconut ice pops, Eskimo Pies, fruit 
bars or other favorite ice cream on sticks can be carried in frozen freezer 
container (such as Donvier ice cream maker) or packed in a container filled 
with dry ice.

MICROWAVE . . . : CHOICE OF CHOICE SAUCES HEATS UP COLD TREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN ANDERSON and ELAINE HANNA, Anderson and Hanna are nutritionists and 
cookbook authors specializing in microwave cookery.

<TEXT>
<P>
Now's the time to rustle up a repertoire of ice cream toppers so that the kids 
can have fun concocting their favorite splits and sundaes. 
</P>
<P>
And so that you, too, can have an elegant dessert "on ice" -- a Peach Melba, 
for example. It's nothing more than a fresh peach half topped by a scoop of 
vanilla ice cream that's crowned by a blush of Melba Sauce that microwaves to 
perfection -- in an instant -- and can be made ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
Because microwaving is a moist method of cooking, all of the just-picked flavor 
of the berries used in the Melba Sauce is preserved. Indeed, it seems to be 
heightened through some feat of culinary alchemy. 
</P>
<P>
Let the kids lend a hand in microwaving other culinary feats that make 
delicious ice cream toppers such as Hot Fudge Sauce. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MELBA SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
2 cups pureed raspberries, strawberries or loganberries 
</P>
<P>
1/3 cup sugar, about 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon cornstarch 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons cold water 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons framboise or Chambord liqueur or red currant jelly 
</P>
<P>
Mix puree and 1/3 cup sugar in microwave-safe 6-cup measure. Cover with wax 
paper and microwave on HIGH (100% power) 3 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Blend cornstarch with water. Whisk cornstarch mixture and lemon juice into 
puree and microwave, uncovered, on HIGH 1 1/2 to 2 minutes until sauce boils 
and thickens slightly. 
</P>
<P>
Stir in framboise, cool, taste for sweetness and add more sugar, if needed. If 
too thick, thin with small amount of water. Makes 2 cups. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Use as sauce for Peach Melba or ladle over plain ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
Variation: For Apricot or Peach Sauce, prepare as directed substituting pureed 
apricots or peaches for berries and peach brandy for framboise. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HOT FUDGE SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
1 cup sugar 
</P>
<P>
1 (5-ounce) can evaporated milk 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon freeze-dried coffee crystals 
</P>
<P>
Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
2 (1-ounce) envelopes unsweetened chocolate 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons butter or margarine, at room temperature 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons vanilla 
</P>
<P>
Cake or ice cream 
</P>
<P>
Mix sugar, milk, coffee crystals and salt in microwave-safe 6-cup measure. 
Microwave, uncovered, on HIGH (100% power) 2 to 2 1/2 minutes, stirring at half 
time, until bubbling. 
</P>
<P>
Whisk in chocolate, butter and vanilla, beating until smooth. Serve warm or at 
room temperature over cake or ice cream. Makes about 1 2/3 cups sauce.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Speckled with red pepper and fresh basil and served in a pool of cheese-dusted 
tomato sauce, this delectable eggplant dish takes no time to prepare -- once 
you've organized the ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EGGPLANT TIMBALES 
</P>
<P>
1 small white onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>
2 cloves garlic, crushed and minced 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
6 Japanese eggplants, peeled, sliced and quartered 
</P>
<P>
3 tablespoons minced fresh basil 
</P>
<P>
1 teaspoon dried oregano, crumbled 
</P>
<P>
1 sweet red pepper, roasted and peeled 
</P>
<P>
White wine or water 
</P>
<P>
2 Roma tomatoes, peeled, seeded and drained of juice 
</P>
<P>
1 medium new potato, boiled, peeled and diced 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup fine whole-wheat bread crumbs 
</P>
<P>
2 eggs, beaten 
</P>

</P>
<P>
Fresh Tomato Sauce 
</P>
<P>
Grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
Whole fresh basil leaves 
</P>
<P>
Saute onion and garlic in olive oil until onion turns translucent. Add 
eggplant, minced basil and oregano and continue to saute over low heat. 
</P>
<P>
Chop 1/2 red pepper and add to pan. Pour in wine 1 tablespoon at time to keep 
mixture from sticking. Cover and steam until eggplant is cooked through, 
checking often to add wine as needed to prevent sticking. 
</P>
<P>
Remove mixture from heat and transfer to work bowl of food processor or 
blender. Add tomatoes, potato, bread crumbs, eggs and 1 cup Parmesan cheese. 
Process until well combined. 
</P>
<P>
Grease 6 individual ramekins with extra-virgin olive oil. Slice remaining red 
pepper into thin strips. Place 3 strips in star pattern on bottom of each 
ramekin. Distribute eggplant puree evenly among ramekins. Place in large baking 
pan of hot water. 
</P>
<P>
Bake at 425 degrees until lightly browned and knife comes out clean, about 40 
minutes. Remove from oven and let cool 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Distribute Fresh Tomato Sauce evenly among 6 serving plates. Sprinkle each with 
grated Parmesan cheese. Turn timbales out into pool of sauce. Garnish with 
fresh basil leaves. Serve at room temperature. Makes 6 servings. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fresh Tomato Sauce

</P>
<P>
Dry white wine 
</P>
<P>
Salt 
</P>
<P>
Freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
Heat olive oil in medium skillet. Add garlic and saute briefly, until garlic 
starts to brown. Remove and discard. 
</P>
<P>
Add tomatoes to hot oil and cook, stirring constantly, until tomatoes break 
down. Add basil and oregano, cover and simmer over low heat 15 minutes, adding 
wine as necessary to prevent sticking and burning. Season to taste with salt 
and pepper. Makes approximately 2 cups.

HINTS FROM HELOISE: TAKING PRECAUTIONS AGAINST FOOD POISONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I recently had a severe case of food poisoning. The doctor told 
me that I had gotten it from some chicken that he thought may not have been 
cooked thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
Would you please share some more information on how to avoid food poisoning? I 
don't ever want to go through that again. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A READER, El Paso, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR READER: Food-borne poisoning can make you feel terrible and can even be 
life-threatening. There are many types of food-borne poisoning: 
</P>
<P>
One type is botulism and can be found in home-canned or other canned goods. 
Always check all canned foods to make sure there are no bulges in the can. If 
any food looks bad, don't taste it. If you think you might have botulism, seek 
medical attention immediately. 
</P>
<P>
Salmonella is a bacteria that is found in meat, poultry, eggs or fish. Foods 
that aren't thoroughly cooked and those that are eaten raw are the major 
culprits. 
</P>
<P>
All foods, utensils and surfaces that have come in contact with raw foods 
should be washed thoroughly with soap and water. If you use a wooden cutting 
board to cut up the raw chicken, be sure to wash it thoroughly in soap and 
water. The knife that you use to cut up the raw chicken shouldn't be used to 
cut up anything else unless washed first. Don't forget to wash your hands if 
you have handled the food. When taking raw chicken to the barbecue on a 
platter, don't use the same platter to put the cooked chicken on unless it has 
been washed. 
</P>
<P>
Staphylococcus is a bacteria that may be found in foods that are left 
unrefrigerated for longer than two hours. Some foods prone to this bacteria are 
cheese, egg products, poultry, meat, pasta, macaroni or potato salads, 
cream-filled desserts or custards. 
</P>
<P>
Again, wash your hands thoroughly before and after preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HELOISE: I was given a beautiful old glass decanter that belonged to my 
grandmother. There are some stains in it that I don't know how to remove. 
</P>
<P>
I don't want to use anything that can damage it. Do you know what I should use 
to clean it? 
</P>
<P>
 -- SARAH, Roanoke, Va. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR SARAH: I have been told by some antiques dealers that sometimes stains 
cannot be removed from old glass. What works best for them is to mix about 
one-quarter of a cup of dishwasher detergent compound with hot water. When the 
water cools, fill the decanter to the top. Let it soak for a few hours or 
overnight. Use a bottle brush to try and remove stubborn stains. 
</P>
<P>
Some stains may remain. Rinse well and let dry. Good luck. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELOISE 
</P>
<P>
 Send a time- or money-saving hint to Heloise, P.O. Box 795000, San Antonio, 
Tex. 78279. Letters will not be answered personally, but the best hints 
received will be used in the Hints From Heloise column.

FOOD BRIEFS: STILL SELLING AFTER ALL THESE YEARS: PRODUCT WINNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Food company executives dream about developing products that will remain 
popular with the public over a decade or more. At present, a new item is 
considered successful if it generates strong sales for just a few years before 
fading to the whims of changing consumer buying habits. 
</P>
<P>
So the fact that several products have just passed the quarter-century mark as 
supermarket fixtures is all the more noteworthy, according to a food industry 
journal. 
</P>
<P>
"Only an estimated 5.4% of the new products introduced in 1964 are still on the 
supermarket shelf today. But some of these have achieved superstar status," 
Grocery Marketing magazine reports. 
</P>
<P>
Although the names are familiar, several of the survivors can be considered a 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
Chief among these are Pop-Tarts from Kellogg. The line of shelf-stable, 
fruit-filled pastries that are heated in the toaster continues to dominate the 
category it created. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Charming After All These Years 
</P>
<P>
Lucky Charms cereal from General Mills also is 25 years old. The product still 
is heavily promoted by the manufacturer, indicating that the firm has 
confidence in the staying power of this children's cereal. 
</P>
<P>
There is no surprise to be found in Diet Pepsi's success, however. Introduced 
as a low-calorie beverage in 1964, Diet Pepsi is now the fourth best-selling 
soft drink, with 5.2% of the nation's soda sales. Pepsico also is spending more 
to promote and advertise the diet version of its flagship brand than in 
previous years, according to Grocery Marketing. 
</P>
<P>
One of 1964's biggest items, in terms of its continued success, has been 
Dorritos Tortilla Chips. In retrospect, the snack food may have been partially 
responsible for the eventual emergence of a full line of Mexican food products 
in supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
"More than 1.2 billion bags of Dorritos were purchased in 1988, nearly five for 
every man, woman and child in the United States," the journal reported. 
</P>
<P>
Helping the brand maintain momentum has been the introduction of several new 
varieties over the years, including the recent debut of Dorritos Light. 
Reportedly, Dorritos are one of the most popular dry, packaged goods sold in 
supermarkets today. 
</P>
<P>
Grocery Marketing also identified some of the biggest "flops" from 25 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Among these was Warm Welcome, a Nabisco snack cracker with an Italian meatball 
flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Another unsuccessful venture was Jolli-Lolli from Fairmont Foods. This frozen 
treat contained a candy sucker inside a chocolate-coated ice milk bar, 
according to the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Jell-O had some problems with two items it brought to market in 1964. These 
included mixed vegetable and celery flavored gelatins sold under the Jell-O for 
Salads label. 
</P>

And Colgate-Palmolive also had trouble with its Bite 'N Brush. This personal 
hygiene product was actually concentrated tooth paste in tablet form. Rather 
than carrying a tube around, consumers need only chew the mint-shaped ovals 
after a meal and the tablets would "burst into rich cleansing foam . . . ready 
for brush action," Grocery Marketing reported.

<P>
Beer Innovation -- While food companies are constantly trying to bring new 
products to market, it has taken one Belgium brewery 150 years to develop 
something different. 
</P>
<P>
This beverage, though, can claim to be novel as well as new. 
</P>
<P>
Lindeman's Farm Brewery, founded in 1816, is now importing its peach beer to 
the United States. Labeled as Peche Lambic, the beer is sold in 12-ounce 
bottles sealed with a cork. 
</P>
<P>
The brewer, based in Vlezenbeek, Belgium, is known for its two other fruit 
beers: Krieken (black cherry) and Framboise (raspberry). 
</P>
<P>
Innovations do not come cheap as the new peach beer will sell for $5 a bottle. 
The steep price reflects the extended brewing process involved in making the 
firm's Lambic beers. For instance, Lindeman's ages its fermented malted barley, 
wheat and wild yeast for 18 months in oak barrels, a process normally reserved 
for premium wine. Only then is fruit added to impart the distinctive color and 
flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the Belgians had to be persuaded by the firm's U.S. importer to 
experiment with the new flavor. A representative of Seattle-based Merchant du 
Vin suggested using peaches after a number of similarly flavored wines became 
popular in this country. 
</P>
<P>
The brewers recommend serving Peche Lambic chilled in a fluted glass as an 
aperitif or as a dessert beverage. 
</P>
<P>
Topping Off Fire -- The barbecue utensils and accessories market is also 
burgeoning with new products. The latest entry is alder wood chips being 
marketed under the Humboldt's Finest Smoke label. Though new to supermarkets, 
commercial fish processors commonly use alder wood to smoke salmon. And 
sportsmen also favor the chips for grilling fish or game. 
</P>
<P>
"Alder wood is used by every smoke house in the Pacific Northwest," said John 
Wayne Miller, whose firm Miller &amp; Reynolds Enterprises, manufactures the 
product. "People who have used it wouldn't try anything else." 
</P>
<P>
After a 10 minute water-soaking, the coin-sized cuttings are placed atop coals 
to impart a rustic flavor to foods. 
</P>
<P>
"Mesquite," Miller said, "is too heavy a flavor for fish, but alder wood really 
enhances seafood." 
</P>
<P>
Realizing the difficulty in getting noticed among all the different briquettes 
and mesquite charcoal, the company decided to vintage date their "golden alder 
bar-b-que chips" as one way of being distinguished from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the 1989 harvest already on the market, Miller &amp; Reynolds have 
also announced plans for their own "smoke off" in the far northern coastal 
reaches of California. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 19, the Humboldt's Finest Smoke Off will be held in Trinidad, Calif., 
20 miles north of Eureka. The public is invited to make the trip along with 
barbecue grill and compete in any of four categories. These include fish, fowl, 
red meat or miscellaneous, the latter encompassing nontraditional grilled items 
such as pizza, bread, or vegetarian entrees. All entries must be cooked with 
alder wood chips. 
</P>
<P>
Prizes will be awarded to the top finishers in each category. And the 
Smoke-off's proceeds will benefit the Trinidad Volunteer Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
For more information and entry forms, write Humboldt's Finest Smoke, P.O. Box 
2567, McKinleyville, Calif. 95521, or call (213) 379-5053. 
</P>
<P>
The alder wood chips sell for $7 per kilogram and are packed in a reusable 
cloth bag. They can be purchased locally at Alpha Beta stores and Big 5 
Sporting Goods. 
</P>
<P>
Cool Prose -- A competition of a colder sort is being staged by Dreyer's Grand 
Ice Cream. The company has announced it is again staging an essay contest in 
hopes of locating 20 people to become ice cream tasters for a day. 
</P>
<P>
Winners receive a free trip to the firm's Oakland headquarters and then will 
assist Dreyer's officials in deciding which new flavors to introduce in the 
coming year. Other prizes include dinner at San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf 
and two nights' lodging. Winners also receive their weight in ice cream payable 
via gift certificates. 
</P>
<P>
The 150-word, or less, essay must address why the contestant would make a good 
ice cream taster. Judges are looking for those who are passionate about frozen 
desserts. 
</P>
<P>
Send entries to Ice Cream Taster, Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream, P.O. Box 1188, 
Lafayette, Calif. 94549-1188. Essay deadline is Aug. 18.

POLICE RESPONSE CRITICIZED AFTER PROTESTERS CLOSE CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura Police Department has come under fire for its handling of a protest 
last week by anti-abortion activists who succeeded in shutting down a family 
planning clinic for nearly five hours by blocking its doors. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Long Beach-based chain that operates Ventura Family Planning 
Associates and an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union complained 
that police effectively sided with Operation Rescue activists by not clearing 
an access path to the clinic last Thursday and waiting until afternoon to 
remove protesters. 
</P>
<P>
"I find that unreasonable," said Carol Sobel, an ACLU attorney. "If you only 
have 75 protesters, you can open access to a clinic in a minute." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Police Capt. Kenneth Thompson defended the department's response, which 
culminated in the peaceful arrest of 19 Operation Rescue protesters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Already Barricaded 
</P>
<P>
"When everyone arrived to have the clinic opened, the pro-life people already 
had the doors barricaded," he said. "We could have grabbed those people and 
dragged them out, but that wasn't a good option. There would have been fights 
and scuffles." 
</P>
<P>
Clinic officials also criticized the police for preventing 10 of the chain's 
security guards from opening a path that would have allowed clinic personnel 
and clients to pass through protesters who were blocking doorways when clinic 
personnel arrived at 7:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel said the police had threatened to arrest the security guards, who have 
been trained to open access to clinics under siege by "jostling" through the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt the response was not only inadequate but the hostility to the property 
owner was inexplicable and indefensible," she said. "They made the Planning 
Associates personnel into the criminals." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson denies threatening the security guards with arrest, but admits to 
preventing them from entering the crowds. He said he was operating on the 
advice of "a number" of police departments who had warned him of a potential 
for fisticuffs. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our goals is to keep a business operating, but I'm also sworn to keep 
the peace, and mixing those two groups together isn't doing that," he said. "I 
was trying to minimize violence." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressing Charges 
</P>
<P>
He said the main reason that police took so long to clear protesters was the 
reluctance on the part of local clinic personnel to press charges. 
</P>
<P>
"The people at the clinic said they didn't want to make arrests -- that they 
wanted to wait for their people from Long Beach to come up and press charges," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials with the chain of 28 clinics admitted requesting a hold on arrests 
until their arrival at 10:15 a.m., but faulted the police for not clearing 
protesters shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
Sobel acknowledged that clinics generally are loathe to press charges against 
protesters because "Operation Rescue views getting arrested as a badge of 
honor, and we don't see anything honorable in what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ACLU Criticized 
</P>
<P>
Don Coleman, an assistant district attorney contacted by the ACLU during the 
protest, stood behind the Ventura Police Department, saying that he "questioned 
whether the ACLU is being reasonable. I presume they wanted people picked up 
and thrown aside." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson said Tuesday that he had met with an official from Ventura's Planned 
Parenthood, which operates two clinics offering abortions in the county, to 
discuss strategy for any future protests and is eager to meet with Family 
Planning officials, but they had not returned a call placed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Joanne Moore, director of Ventura County services for Planned Parenthood, 
expressed satisfaction with the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"If there were a blockade, I would expect the Ventura Police Department to 
respond appropriately and I have no reason to believe that they wouldn't," she 
said. However, she noted that a four-hour delay in the opening of one of her 
clinics would be unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Violence of Another Sort' 
</P>
<P>
Anything that jeopardizes a patient's right to medical care "is not right," she 
said. "That smacks of violence of another sort." 
</P>
<P>
In a six-month spate of Operation Rescue protests surrounding the recent 
Supreme Court ruling on abortion, all but Ventura and two other Southern 
California clinics have been able to keep their doors open, said Sobel. 
</P>
<P>
The other occasions came on a single day in February when 500 Operation Rescue 
activists demonstrated at separate clinics throughout Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles City Council members later successfully pressed police Chief Daryl 
F. Gates for assurances that protesters with Operation Rescue would be arrested 
when they disrupt business at abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Actions Elsewhere 
</P>
<P>
Many clinics have been able to keep their doors open by cooperating with police 
and pro-choice forces. Security guards have been used effectively to preserve 
access to clinics under siege on other occasions, Sobel said. 
</P>
<P>
In Inglewood, security guards lifted clients over rows of protesters blocking 
doorways, said Michael Monji, the chain's associate administrator. 
</P>
<P>
On other occasions, police have taken a more active role. At a March protest in 
Cypress, police officers protected a back entrance to a clinic that had been 
surrounded by 600 protesters, said the office manager of Cypress Family 
Planning Associates Medical Group. 
</P>
<P>
"The police have been very cooperative all along," said the Cypress employee, 
who declined to give her name.

GLENDALE COUNCIL EXTENDS FREEZE ON BUILDING APARTMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a renewed effort to limit the city's population to close to the 200,000 
residents recommended in the General Plan, the Glendale's City Council on 
Tuesday extended its 10-month-old moratorium on apartment construction until 
next February. 
</P>
<P>
The extension, approved on a 4-1 vote, will give the council sufficient time to 
adopt a zoning ordinance reducing the population density in neighborhoods where 
apartments and condominiums are allowed, City Manager David Ramsay said. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium excludes projects that provide housing for low- to 
moderate-income senior citizens, Planning Director John McKenna said. 
</P>
<P>
The building freeze, which was due to expire August 22 after two previous 
extensions, has been challenged in court by developers whose projects are being 
held up in the plan approval stage, but City Atty. Frank Manzano said he was 
confident that the judges will rule in the city's favor. 
</P>
<P>
"The moratorium is less than a year old so far, and the courts have upheld 
moratoriums for more than two years," said Manzano, "so we're in the ballpark 
as far as that's concerned." 
</P>
<P>
Closing arguments in one of the lawsuits before the appellate court are 
scheduled for July 26. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the 
developers, but the city appealed. The second suit is awaiting the appellate 
court decision on the first one. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the extension is grossly unfair to the projects in the pipeline," said 
Haik Vartanian, who heads the group of 30 developers that sued the city. 
Vartanian had three projects awaiting approval by the Planning Department when 
the moratorium was imposed in September, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'All Talk' 
</P>
<P>
"We're still in the same situation we were 10 months ago," he said. "It's all 
talk and no action." 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Dick Jutras, who cast the only dissenting vote, said he was 
concerned about the suits and whether it is fair to keep the developers on hold 
for another extended period. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we were going to lift the moratorium with whatever interim zoning 
standards we work out while we consider a permanent solution," Jutras argued. 
All zoning proposals need a 4-1 majority for approval. 
</P>
<P>
For the last two months, the council tried to agree on interim zoning 
restrictions to lift the moratorium, but was unable to reach agreement. Council 
members Carl Raggio and Ginger Bremberg and Mayor Jerold Milner favored 
reducing by half the number of new building units allowed in apartment 
neighborhoods while a permanent solution was worked out, but Jutras and 
Councilman Larry Zarian blocked the proposal for easing the moratorium, saying 
it was "too drastic." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Zarian voted with the majority Tuesday to extend the ban on 
apartment construction, a more extreme step than those he has opposed in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Might as Well' 
</P>
<P>
"If we can't agree on the right numbers, we might as well extend the 
moratorium," he said. 
</P>
<P>
McKenna said it would take the Planning Department at least six months to come 
up with an ordinance outlining the zoning reductions favored by the council. 
</P>
<P>
"February is an optimistic target date, depending on factors beyond our 
control," such as the length of the public hearings, McKenna explained. "The 
council direction is to make this process as fast as possible." 
</P>
<P>
In an interview after the council meeting, McKenna outlined the timetable to 
ready the draft ordinance for approval. The first step, McKenna said, would be 
to review the draft amendments to the General Plan, rewrite density 
descriptions and amend city maps. This process would be completed by the end of 
October, McKenna said. 
</P>
<P>
Next would be to develop environmental reports and analyses of projected 
population changes, to study similar examples of population reductions in other 
cities, and to amend the zoning code. This process would be completed by the 
end of November. 
</P>
<P>
December and January would be spent in preparing, advertising and finally 
conducting public hearings before both the Planning Commission and the City 
Council, McKenna said. Two months, with a holiday break in between, would be 
the bare minimum time for this process, he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prevent Rush 
</P>
<P>
The building moratorium was adopted unanimously on September 27, 1988, to 
prevent a rush of building applications while the city considered zoning 
changes to control its growth. Two months later, the Planning Department 
introduced a draft ordinance that was hailed by council members as the solution 
to the city's growth problems, such as traffic congestion and school 
overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
By late February, council members acknowledged that the proposed ordinance 
would do little more than improve the city's appearance and began calling the 
proposal the "design ordinance." Soon thereafter, the council instructed 
McKenna and his staff to begin work on the zoning restrictions, and on Tuesday 
the moratorium was extended for a third time to allow the Planning Department 
staff enough time to come up with a proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the design ordinance, which would end the moratorium if it were 
adopted, has become a fixture on the City Council agenda. Last Wednesday, it 
was postponed for the 10th time. 
</P>
<P>
However, Manzano said, Tuesday's building freeze extension preempts the 
moratorium-ending clause of the design ordinance. With this obstacle out of the 
way, the council is expected to adopt the design ordinance next week, imposing 
landscaping, lot size, parking and other restrictions on apartment and 
condominium construction.

HOLY TOUCHDOWN; 
</P>
<P>
THERE'S A FLAG ON THE PLAY, BUT LA CANADA CARTOON MAP'S CREATOR GETS POINT 
ACROSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The statue of an unnamed Christian, hands reaching skyward 85 feet above 
Foothill Boulevard, commands the La Canada Flintridge business district with a 
gaze of stark piety. 
</P>
<P>
To the less reverent, however, the statue in front of Lutheran Church is known 
as the "Holy Touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
"La Canada is just begging to be made fun of," said artist Lee Littler, 18, a 
La Canada High School graduate paid $200 to draw an official cartoon map of the 
city of 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
The city is distributing 6,000 copies of the 3-foot-long map to libraries and 
shopping centers to be used in a coloring contest for children. City officials 
and Littler will judge the entries, which must be submitted by Aug. 15. The 
winner will receive $100. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Statue Appeared as Referee 
</P>
<P>
But the version of the map the city's children are coloring is not exactly as 
Littler conceived it. On the original drawing, now filed in City Hall, Littler 
dressed the town's most prominent landmark in a referee's jersey. And his 
reference to the statue as the "Holy Touchdown" set off whistles from city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt that with it being a city project, some of the things didn't belong in 
it," said Katy Daunis, coordinator of the project for La Canada Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
But Littler seems to have done an end run. A close look at the map shows 
several pinstripes up and down the garb of the religious figure. 
</P>
<P>
"And the locals will still get it," he said. " 'Church of the Holy Touchdown' 
is an affectionate pet name, not an insult." 
</P>
<P>
However, he said of the city's insistence that he change the drawing: "The 
censorship was very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
While admitting that his misspelling of some of the business names on the map 
was partially responsible for revisions he was forced to make, he maintained 
that some of the changes came about because of "La Canada's preoccupation with 
money, which is sometimes healthy and sometimes sickening." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bank Drawn in Larger Scale 
</P>
<P>
In early drafts of the map, not enough of Foothill Boulevard was depicted to 
suit city officials, he said. In the final version, a strip of stores and 
businesses along Foothill is so detailed that virtually every business is 
represented by name. He also noted that he was required to draw the Bank of 
America building too large on the map. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd come out of there with white-out all over my hands saying, 'Here, is this 
OK?' " he said of meetings with city officials. "They were pretty adamant about 
getting all of the businesses in." 
</P>
<P>
On the map, small signs saying only "Residential Area" mark the much larger 
portions of the community where people live. 
</P>
<P>
Editing aside, Daunis said the city is happy with the map. She said Littler's 
offbeat humor "wasn't difficult to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
And Littler said he is glad to have had the job and hopes it will help him 
become a syndicated cartoonist. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada Flintridge decided to commission the cartoon map last fall. Littler 
was recommended for the job by Karen Mealiffe, an artist who teaches at La 
Canada High. Mealiffe had discovered Littler in a pottery class during his 
junior year. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't doing very well in school, Mealiffe said. He did not respond to 
formalized art classes and only wanted to draw, she said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suddenly Flourished 
</P>
<P>
"High school for me was four years of trying to find acceptance," Littler said. 
</P>
<P>
Mealiffe enrolled the reluctant student in an independent study program where 
"he just flourished," she said. "He was just very intelligent, and I don't 
think any of his teachers realized it." 
</P>
<P>
Mealiffe said she had no problem recommending Littler for the job, even though 
the city is considered staunchly conservative. 
</P>
<P>
"Some kids have wheels and some kids don't. Lee has wheels," she said. "A 
person can draw, but if he doesn't have wheels -- ideas -- he won't make it." 
</P>
<P>
Mealiffe, 45, said she empathizes with Littler's struggle against civic 
orthodoxy. "An artist doesn't always do what the public wants," she said.

JUNIOR LIFEGUARD PROGRAM IS HELPING TRAIN A NEW GENERATION IN RESPECT FOR THE 
OCEAN

"Down on your stomachs! 
</P>
<P>
"Roll!" 
</P>
<P>
The orders are barked, military style. But there's nothing military about the 
response. 
</P>
<P>
"Awww, we just did this," pipe some 30 young voices. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, we're going to do it again. Move!" 
</P>
<P>
And with that, instructor John Hunter leads a red-suited attack on the surf at 
Ventura State Beach, where the Channel Coast Junior Lifeguard program is 
beginning its 19th summer. 
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the California Department of Parks and Recreation, the Junior 
Lifeguard program is open to 9- to 15-year-olds and is offered during two 
four-week sessions, July 5-29 and Aug. 1-26. 
</P>
<P>
The program is designed to teach beach and ocean safety and ecology, lifeguard 
techniques, first aid and CPR. It serves as a recruiting tool -- especially for 
affirmative action programs aimed at increasing the number of minorities who 
are certified lifeguards -- and keeps children busy in the summer while 
teaching them to protect themselves in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
This year's enrollment was the highest ever, with 125 signed up for the first 
session. 
</P>
<P>
As slim at 31 as most of her students, Junior Lifeguard director Sandy Dungan 
can be picked out of the crowd only by her signature wide-brimmed straw hat. 
"I've been doing this for 12 years," she says, "and I'm always amazed when the 
first day goes smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
"We divide up into three groups and rotate instructors every 30 minutes," 
Dungan explains, checking her watch. Hunter's class on water orientation -- run 
in; don't let the waves knock you down -- is now in the water, although some of 
the recruits exhibit a little reluctance because the water is cold. 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, instructor Jon Silver is introducing a session on beach manners. 
"What does the term 'beach manners' mean to you?" he asks. Several hands shoot 
up. "Obey the rules." "Pick up trash." "Set a good example for your friends and 
parents." 
</P>
<P>
Silver applauds and adds: "Also, if you see seagulls eating somebody's lunch, 
don't just laugh. Rescue the lunch. It could be your lunch!" 
</P>
<P>
About 30 feet away, instructor Brian Flick is discussing ocean and beach safety 
with another group. After reviewing some of the common-sense rules (swim with a 
buddy; know which way the current is going), he entreats his students to think 
of other, less obvious beach hazards. 
</P>
<P>
"People from Idaho!" comes the answer, drawing a laugh at the expense of 
tourists in general. 
</P>
<P>
County officials hope that many of these small, shivering, sand-covered kids 
will become real lifeguards someday. 
</P>
<P>
"We employ about 40 people during the summer season to be able to staff 23 
guards a day. The turnover rate is 15% to 25% each year, so we are constantly 
recruiting," says District Lifeguard Supervisor Steve White. 
</P>
<P>
Some recruiting efforts have been aimed at high schools and colleges with high 
minority enrollment. Another has been to maintain an open line to the city of 
Ventura's Summer Youth Employment Training Program. Through this program, 
teen-agers do light housekeeping work at the Channel Coast Lifeguard 
headquarters in exchange for tuition-free enrollment in the Junior Lifeguard 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
White expects this summer-job program, more than any other single source, to 
keep Ventura County beaches supplied with qualified lifeguards in years to 
come. An increasing number of recruits are from groups not traditionally 
represented, such as Asians, Hispanics and blacks. 
</P>
<P>
"While most of our new recruits come to the program by word of mouth, this year 
we made a concentrated effort to involve those kids who might have felt they 
couldn't afford the program," Dungan said. 
</P>
<P>
"While the $160 tuition fee breaks down to little more than $2 an hour for four 
hours a day of supervised instruction, we still don't like to turn anyone away 
for lack of money," Dungan says. Toward that end, she sent letters to 
organizations and businesses this year seeking scholarship funds for the 
program. She got only one contribution, of $50. 
</P>
<P>
Although Dungan will sometimes lower tuition fees for those who need a 
financial break, she gives no quarter when it comes to minimum swimming 
requirements. Potential junior guards must be able to swim 100 yards on the 
surface, 10 yards underwater, and tread water for five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Testing is done in a pool instead of the ocean because, Dungan explains, "we 
don't want to scare off an otherwise competent swimmer just because the ocean 
is too cold. Initially, we just want confident swimmers. We will turn them into 
ocean swimmers." 
</P>
<P>
According to one of its supporters, the Junior Lifeguard Program teaches more 
than just ocean swimming. 
</P>
<P>
"Respect," says Erica Huddy. "They are always teaching respect for the ocean." 
When she and her husband, John, moved from the East Coast to California in 
1987, it quickly became evident that their 12-year-old son, John, had an 
affinity for the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"He always wanted to be at the beach with his friends, and I was constantly 
worried about safety," said Mrs. Huddy. "I was caught in a rip-current many 
years ago in Florida, and I've never forgotten it." 
</P>
<P>
Young John attended both sessions last summer, and Mrs. Huddy says she feels 
comfortable letting him go to the beach now. "His endurance at the end of the 
summer was phenomenal. He's doing the program this year because he wants to." 
</P>
<P>
That's an allusion to the fact that more often than not, it is the parents who 
"encourage" -- some of the children would say order -- them to try out for the 
program. But it is the swimmers themselves who maintain a 25% rate of repeat 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
Partially billed as a "sun, sand, surf, games and windsurfing" time at the 
beach, the program is also a hard-core, competitive learning process that 
results in intermittent groaning, sore muscles and shivering. But some parents 
say their children's initial complaints about heartless instructors eventually 
give way to good-natured grousing. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Taft says he and his wife had to push daughter Jamie, 13, to try out for 
the program last year. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want her just hanging around the house," he said. "Then she'd come 
home saying, 'Boy, it was hard today. . . . You wouldn't believe what we had to 
do.' But by the end of the session she was beginning to like the tan and the 
hair bleached from the sun and the way she felt. She felt good about her 
improved endurance and swimming ability too." 
</P>
<P>
That she didn't need pushing this year was evident as she got out of the pool 
from her successful tryout swim. "I'd rather be doing this than nothing, and 
saving lives is kind of fun," Jamie said, referring to the many simulated 
rescues that participants must perform. 
</P>
<P>
Laurie Culmback is a veteran Junior Lifeguard mother. Her oldest, 16-year-old 
Tom Collins, will be a teaching assistant this summer after four years in the 
program and plans to become a fully certified lifeguard next summer. 
</P>
<P>
His brother, Truth, who is 13 and in his fourth year, considers the program an 
indispensable part of summer, saying simply: "It's a good time." 
</P>
<P>
Not to be outdone by her older brothers, 11-year-old Mercy Collins made the cut 
this year after not being a strong enough swimmer last year. "I really wanted 
to make it this year," she said. In order to assure herself a place in this 
summer's program, she practiced swimming at a friend's pool during the school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Carly Brandon, 16, after enduring the rigors of Junior Lifeguard training since 
she was 10, is now a certified lifeguard on Ventura County beaches. She has 
been on the swimming team since entering Ventura High School, where she is a 
senior, and says that even before she entered the Junior Lifeguard program six 
years ago, she wanted to be a lifeguard because "I always looked up to them." 
</P>
<P>
Casey Culp, another new Ventura lifeguard, is also a product of the Junior 
Lifeguard program. Culp, a Ventura High School junior who competes on the water 
polo and track teams, wanted to be a lifeguard ever since he can remember. "I 
really love the beach," he said. "Maybe I would like to do this as a career." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura College business student Ian Conley got involved in Junior Lifeguards 
at age 11 and is now in his fifth year as a lifeguard. Raised in Hawaii and 
Ventura, Conley says he "decided to be a lifeguard pretty early on because it 
sounded like a neat summer job . . . and it is. 
</P>
<P>
"I was keeping an eye on three little kids playing in ankle-deep water when I 
saw a huge wave coming in. I got down off the tower just as the wave was 
pulling one of the kids out. I pulled him out and grabbed the other two. I felt 
like a hero that day. It was my best rescue!" 
</P>
<P>
Most of the young participants agree that the Junior Lifeguard program is not a 
typical relaxed day at the beach, and that run-swim-run drills and swimming in 
sometimes frigid and choppy waters are a far cry from a dip in the pool. But 
many return for more, summer after summer. 
</P>
<P>
With more than 10 months between them and last summer's jellyfish sting, 
sunburn, clammy fog and gritty sand in their suits, they decide that maybe they 
had a good time after all.

LABORERS' STEP FORWARD IS A SETBACK FOR DAY-CARE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Catholic Youth Organization has a problem. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday the church-run community center's summer day-care program opened, and 
so far only 20 to 25 children have registered, fewer than half the number in 
previous years. 
</P>
<P>
The organization's director said parents are afraid of the day laborers, a 
seemingly destitute, mostly unshaven and poorly dressed group of men who until 
recently packed the CYO parking lot and crowded its entrance every morning. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Glendale has a problem too. Its solution to the presence elsewhere 
of day laborers was built around the CYO's ability to accommodate them. 
</P>
<P>
The CYO, on San Fernando Road in Glendale's industrial zone, opened its grounds 
in September to 20 or 30 workers, mostly undocumented immigrants, who once 
solicited work at a downtown corner next to a paint store. The voluntary CYO 
action averted a hotly debated city proposal that would have made it illegal 
for people to solicit work on public property. 
</P>
<P>
Word got around that the site was city-sanctioned and free of Immigration and 
Naturalization Service raids. Immigrants from all over Los Angeles County 
flocked there. 
</P>
<P>
When work became scarce, some men returned to the downtown corner. Now Glendale 
has two pickup sites for day laborers instead of one, and neither meets the 
needs of the workers or the construction contractors who typically hire them. 
</P>
<P>
The CYO, in the meantime, is paying for its generosity. It now helps more day 
laborers than it ever expected, and its other programs are suffering. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the workers need a new pickup site, but they haven't found 
an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Louise Chavez, CYO director, refused to discuss the extent of her efforts to 
persuade the city to find a new site. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now it's all up in the air," said Rick Reyes, the city's community 
relations coordinator who is in charge of the day laborer program. "It's not 
easy to find a place for this type of program, but we're trying." 
</P>
<P>
At first a handful, the number of laborers arriving at the CYO grew to 150 by 
early June. The crowds made it more difficult for would-be employers to reach 
the CYO. Workers began camping on San Fernando Road, drifting farther and 
farther apart and flagging down contractors before they reached the sanctioned 
pickup site. Mini-mob scenes occurred whenever a contractor slowed his truck to 
hire workers. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the CYO hired two part-time supervisors, using its own funds, to 
try to keep the workers inside the parking lot and organized. They made lists 
of workers and distributed jobs to those who arrived first. 
</P>
<P>
Now the laborers are back on the streets because the supervisors shoo them off 
by 9 a.m., when mothers drop off their children. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
50 Yards 
</P>
<P>
The workers settle about 50 yards away and patiently wait for work until 1 or 2 
p.m., cautiously approaching the CYO building one at a time to use the 
restroom. 
</P>
<P>
Their presence, albeit a distant one, has transformed the day-care center. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to have at least 50 children, sometimes more than 200," Chavez said as 
two dozen youngsters sat around a long table, preparing for the first song of 
the morning. "Look around; we're nowhere close." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I'm worried because with all these people, one never knows what can 
happen," said Nancy Gasalla, 39, who was dropping off her 10-year-old daughter, 
Caterina. "But the laborers are not here now, and it looks like the situation 
is under control." 
</P>
<P>
George Medina, 67, whose son Jonathan, 7, had joined the other children, said: 
"Things look better this morning, but with all those people standing in front 
of the door, it was impossible to get in. Some of the workers seem to be 
educated people, but you never know about the rest." 
</P>
<P>
Back on the street corners, workers now wonder why they should bother to sign 
up for city-approved hiring. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Waiting 
</P>
<P>
"The contractors don't bother to go to the CYO," said Bernardo Gutierrez, 46. 
"They pick up the first workers they spot" on the street corners. "I've been on 
the list for three weeks, and I'm still waiting for my name to be called." 
</P>
<P>
Most workers, however disheartened by the results so far, said they would 
continue to cooperate with CYO supervisors because they want to see the list 
system work. 
</P>
<P>
"There are advantages and disadvantages to the list," said Jose Luis Salcido, 
26. "It takes three days to be called up by the supervisors, but they write 
down the contractor's license plate and the amount they say they will pay, so 
it's more likely that they will pay us for our work." 
</P>
<P>
Several day laborers have complained that they were not paid by the contractors 
after a hard day's work. Juan Jose Gomez, 22, said he spent an entire day 
carrying gravel for a contractor and was not paid for his effort. Another man 
reported $450 in unpaid wages to supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm staying put because I have to bring food to my children," Salcido said. 
"Hope is the last thing one loses." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Work 
</P>
<P>
Fewer than 50 workers were at the building Monday, about one-third of the 
number showing up a month ago. Workers say their numbers are dwindling because 
there is less work. Only 10 laborers were picked up. 
</P>
<P>
Herman Sillas, an attorney hired by the city as a consultant on minority 
issues, said Glendale's apartment building moratorium is responsible for 
slowing the work demand. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say they are looking for a new place to provide day laborers 
with a permanent site. Meanwhile, they say, the immigrants have the right to 
solicit work on street corners. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no such thing as loitering in the city of Glendale," Reyes said. "The 
workers may be cited for jaywalking, littering or obstructing the sidewalks, 
but they have every right to be there and ask for work. Nobody can ticket them 
simply for being brown." 
</P>
<P>
The lack of a permanent site for the day laborers is making it more difficult 
for the city to clear a downtown corner of job-seekers. On Tuesday, about 25 
men were sitting beside the paint store, waiting for work. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could only identify the contractors and tell them about what we're 
doing, we wouldn't have that problem," Sillas said. "We need to publicize our 
program more." 
</P>
<P>
Getting the contractors to drive to a sanctioned spot requires a permanent 
place where the workers aren't a problem. And that's a problem.

ORMOND BEACH MARINA PLAN FACES MANY OBSTACLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ormond Beach on Oxnard's southern tip is so remote that only two roads reach 
it, yet the future of the largely undeveloped area has emerged as a focal point 
in discussions about the city's updated General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists concerned about a proposal to build a $2-billion marina-based 
development at Ormond Beach dominated testimony about the General Plan before 
the Oxnard Planning Commission last week. The development would include a golf 
course, hotels, businesses, 8,135 homes and a regional airport. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the developer, the Irvine-based Baldwin Co., plan to ask the 
commission tonight to allow 2,638 more houses than the 8,135 recommended in the 
General Plan update, which would be a blueprint for Oxnard's growth over the 
next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
And the U.S. Navy, whose Pacific Missile Test Center would border the 
development on the south, is deciding whether to testify about its numerous 
concerns, said Mark Schultz, the center's director of facility planning. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Zimmer, the project's manager, remains undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Nice Facility' 
</P>
<P>
"This is an opportunity to create a nice facility that would be developed in a 
regularly planned process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At issue is how much -- if any -- development will be allowed on 2,900 acres of 
beachfront, where agricultural and industrial uses have coexisted for years. 
</P>
<P>
The Planning Commission's decisions on these and other facets of the General 
Plan will act as recommendations to the City Council, which will consider the 
plan in September. But the commission's deliberations are important because 
they serve as a preview of the issues facing the council. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council's conclusions will determine whether the development can 
proceed to the Ventura County Local Agency Formation Commission, which would 
have to approve the city's annexation of 1,000 to 1,500 acres. The project 
would then require the approval of the California Coastal Commission, which 
regulates coastal development. 
</P>
<P>
While stating that the development overall would benefit Oxnard, the updated 
General Plan prepared by the General Plan Advisory Committee paints a less than 
flattering view of some of the development's effects. 
</P>
<P>
The report says the development would cause the irretrievable loss of 1,017 
acres of agricultural land, resulting in $10 million in lost agricultural 
productivity and undermining the committee's goal of balancing new housing with 
new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
While the 8,135 homes that the committee is recommending for Ormond Beach would 
boost the city's population by 23,157 people -- roughly one-third of the new 
population it projects citywide over the next 30 years -- the area would 
generate only one-sixth of the new jobs citywide over that period. 
</P>
<P>
The committee predicted that the development would increase beach erosion south 
of Ormond Beach, an area that includes a wetland sanctuary. The Navy, which 
maintains the sanctuary, spends thousands of dollars annually to keep erosion 
from washing away spawning grounds for fish and nesting grounds for migratory 
birds, some of which are endangered species, Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
But the development's opponents, including Ormond Beach Observers -- a group 
that claims to represent nine other mostly environmental organizations -- 
complained last week that the report barely touched on the development's 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
Roma Arbrust, a Ventura resident and member of Ormond Beach Observers, 
complained that the report didn't include the cost of dredging the marina, a 
job that usually falls to the Army Corps of Engineers, which has threatened to 
reduce maintenance of pleasure marinas because of funding cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Leake, a Camarillo resident and chairman of the Los Padres Chapter of 
the Sierra Club, said the report didn't detail how the development would affect 
the Ormond Beach wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
While Baldwin plans to protect 50 acres of wetlands, Oxnard City Planner 
Matthew Winegar said, it is unclear how the development would affect the 
remaining wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seawater Intrusion 
</P>
<P>
Jean Harris, an Oxnard resident and committee member, said the General Plan 
failed to address how carving a marina out of the coast would affect seawater 
intrusion that already taints many of the area's aquifers. 
</P>
<P>
She wondered whether soils near the mouth of the proposed marina have been 
contaminated by a nearby aluminum recycling plant that has been unsuccessfully 
sued by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Coastal Commission and Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many unanswered questions," Harris said. "I just don't think the 
Planning Commission and council have enough information to approve it." 
</P>
<P>
Robert L. Braitman, LAFCO's executive director, said LAFCO would block the 
development if it encroaches on naval activities at Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has maintained that planes taking off from an airport so near their 
own strips and pleasure boats leaving a marina so close to missile-testing 
would encroach on their activities. 
</P>
<P>
Such impediments to the development's approval are so great that Bill Allayaud, 
a Coastal Commission legislative coordinator, said that if Baldwin were to 
"pull it off, it would be a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who tries to develop a wetland knows that they're in trouble," he said. 
"It's very hard to do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demand for Marinas 
</P>
<P>
But David Johnson, the legislative coordinator for the state Department of 
Boating and Waterways, said that strong demand for pleasure marinas has 
produced "a list of 20 to 30 new or expanded harbor projects throughout the 
state" in the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a lot of time, but it's doable," he said, adding that Baldwin may be 
eligible for state funds through a program that encourages the private 
construction of marinas to help defray the costs of building the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Project manager Zimmer shares Johnson's enthusiasm, providing he obtains 
approval for the additional homes. Otherwise, he said, Baldwin cannot afford to 
build the marina, which was first suggested by city officials. 
</P>
<P>
Zimmer said the larger development would provide enough profits to allow the 
developer to maintain the harbor. "Our studies don't assume any state funds 
would be available," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The project's effect on aquifers and wetlands will be addressed in three 
subsequent environmental reviews, Zimmer said. 
</P>
<P>
Concerns about soil safety where the channel would be cut are unnecessary, he 
said. Baldwin has already tested 342 acres nearest to Ormond Beach industries 
and concluded that they were clean, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for the wetlands, he said, Baldwin has determined that building the marina 
would remove only 12 acres. He said the company would replace the lost wetlands 
with 12 acres of new inland wetlands.

FIRM WINS CONTRACT TO TEST FOR ESCAPING GAS AT LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Whittier City Council has approved a contract with Kleinfelder/Mandeville 
&amp; Associates to test for escaping gas at the Savage Canyon Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
The testing and monitoring process, which will cost the city about $122,000, is 
required by the South Coast Air Quality Management District, according to city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier officials have until Sept. 1 to complete testing for the possible 
escape of landfill gas into the atmosphere. Organic compounds emit gases as 
they decompose. The AQMD limit on the amount of acceptable gas released into 
the atmosphere is 50 parts per million of atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Although two other firms submitted proposals that were lower in cost, 
Kleinfelder/Mandeville was selected because it already has acted as a liaison 
between the AQMD and the city, according to a staff report.

2ND ANTI-EMINENT DOMAIN ACTIVIST TO RUN FOR COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thirteen-year Montebello resident Larry Salazar, who helped run the successful 
campaign that stopped the city from acquiring land-taking power in south 
Montebello, has announced his candidacy for the City Council in November. 
</P>
<P>
Salazar, head of Citizens Against Eminent Domain, is the second person to 
formally announce a campaign for city office since voters defeated two ballot 
measures that would have given the Community Redevelopment Agency the power of 
eminent domain in two industrial sections of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Activist Shirley Garcia, who worked with Salazar, announced her candidacy a 
month after voters on April 2 rejected the controversial ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
There will be three council seats open in the Nov. 7 municipal election. Two 
incumbents, Arnold Glasman and Edward Pizzorno, have said they plan to run for 
reelection, and Mayor William Nighswonger has announced that he will retire. 
</P>
<P>
In a prepared press statement, Salazar said that "slow, planned and controlled 
growth" is the most important issue the city faces. He also promised to change 
the "lack of response to the needs of the community," a charge that he and 
other anti-eminent domain leaders leveled against a majority of council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
As a resident of south Montebello, Salazar said he is "concerned with the 
unique situations that residents face in the area and the need for a police 
substation in south Montebello." 
</P>
<P>
Another leader of the anti-eminent domain movement, former Councilman William 
Molinari, has said he is still pondering whether he will seek to regain his 
spot on the five-member council.

LYNN DYMALLY NAMED TO FILL SCHOOL BOARD VACANCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lynn Dymally, daughter of Rep. Mervyn Dymally (D-Compton), was appointed to the 
Compton Unified School District Board of Education on Tuesday night to replace 
Bernice Woods, who resigned this month after being elected to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment, which came without any advance public notice by the board, was 
made on a 4-2 vote, with Trustees Kelvin D. Filer and John Steward voting 
against it. According to Filer, he and Steward voted no because they wanted the 
voters, not the board, to decide on Woods' replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law governing school board resignations, Dymally can serve only 
until November. At that time she must step aside or face the voters in order to 
continue to serve the two years remaining in Woods' four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
Several people have expressed interest in running for Woods' seat, as well as 
for four other seats that will be open this year on the seven-member school 
board. Filing for the November election opens July 17 and closes Aug. 11. 
</P>
<P>
This is the second time Dymally has served on the board. She was elected to a 
four-year term that ended in 1987, when she chose not to run for reelection.

SCOPE: VOLUNTEENS CHANGE THEIR STRIPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROCHELLE WILKERSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Mona Dyjor returned home she could not stop talking to her family about 
what she had just witnessed while on duty at Downey Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"You see it on television and in the movies, but nothing is like the real 
thing," Dyjor said. 
</P>
<P>
"Seeing the mother's expression when she sees the baby for the first time. . . 
," she said, waving her hands but stopping short of describing fully the birth 
she had watched. 
</P>
<P>
Dyjor is a Candy Striper, but instead of running errands and answering 
telephones, she and 60 other young volunteers from Downey schools were working 
in the hospital emergency room, obstetrics, the labs and with patients. 
</P>
<P>
Dyjor, a recent Warren High School graduate, was participating in the Volunteen 
Program at Downey Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
It was as part of the program that she found herself in the delivery room 
watching the birth of a child. "I was only in there for the last 10 minutes of 
the delivery," Dyjor said. "The nurses showed and explained everything to me, 
step by step." 
</P>
<P>
The Downey hospital last year began allowing Volunteens to work in the medical 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
"Before, we just sat at the desk. Now we have more physical contact with 
people," said Jennifer DeKay, 16, of Downey High School. She has been a 
Volunteen for two years and believes the change has been for the better. "You 
get to see what it is really like." 
</P>
<P>
The result has been an increase in enrollment and more male participation, said 
Dari Caldwell, director of nursing administration. 
</P>
<P>
The premise of Downey Community's Volunteen program is simple: introduce the 
young person to as many aspects of the health field as possible so that he or 
she will consider a career in the medical field. 
</P>
<P>
Candy Stripers still wear the traditional pink and white striped uniforms, and 
state law prohibits the volunteers, and all non-medical personnel, from 
administering medicine or offering medical advice. 
</P>
<P>
Caldwell is one of three advisers in the program who was instrumental in 
bringing about the changes. The hospital's auxiliary had coordinated the old 
program since its founding in 1965 and allowed youths to work only at menial 
tasks. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the Volunteens have their own bank account and officers. They raise funds 
that will be used to purchase equipment for the hospital at the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Three annual scholarships have been established by the nursing administration's 
retention and recruitment committee to encourage graduating high school seniors 
to pursue nursing careers at an accredited college and to consider Downey 
Community Hospital as their first work choice when they complete the college 
nursing program. 
</P>
<P>
The Volunteen program attempts to make the teen-agers more responsible, and it 
succeeds, Caldwell said. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a growing experience for a lot of these workers," Caldwell said, 
adding that she is amazed at how much they mature during a year at the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Downey High School sophomore Henry Castro has worked about 100 hours since he 
started volunteering last September. He is most helpful to the Downey Community 
Hospital when the waiting room in the Emergency Room is backed up with 
patients, according to Lynn Danes, charge nurse. 
</P>
<P>
"Henry helps calm people down when language is a barrier," Danes said. Castro 
often acts as interpreter for the staff and patients. "With younger kids he has 
a rapport. He shows people that they are not . . . being ignored. He makes it a 
lot easier on us," Danes said. 
</P>
<P>
Castro is one of five young men participating in the Volunteen program. 
Although he has not told his male buddies at school that he is a Volunteen, he 
says his volunteer work is important. 
</P>
<P>
"You get the feeling that you actually are doing something to help somebody. I 
like that feeling," said Castro, who hopes to become a cardiologist. "It shows 
kids what they can do and a way to go. A lot of kids don't know what to do in 
life."

MAN SENTENCED TO PRISON OVER 3 ACCIDENT DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Hollywood man found guilty last month of manslaughter for killing three 
people when his speeding car crashed into theirs was sentenced Wednesday to 16 
years and eight months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Aram Barsumyan, 30, a Soviet Armenian emigre, was convicted of three counts of 
gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and four other felony charges in 
connection with a Dec. 19, 1987, crash on Los Feliz Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Police say Barsumyan's car was speeding when he lost control of the vehicle 
going over a drainage ditch, swerved into the westbound lane and crashed 
head-on into a car carrying a family on a holiday shopping trip. 
</P>
<P>
Killed in the crash were Francisco Cruz, 42, of Azusa; his wife, Olga Yolanda 
Cruz, 31, and Olga's sister, Maria Hernandez, 33, of Los Angeles. The Cruzes' 
two children were injured in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
A jury was unable to reach a verdict on second-degree murder charges filed 
against Barsumyan. 
</P>
<P>
The sentence handed down by Pasadena Superior Court Judge Jack B. Tso is only 
four months short of the maximum 17 years in prison Barsumyan could have 
received on the charges.

9-HOME TRACT APPROVED WITH EQUESTRIAN ZONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Construction is expected to start in about six months on nine single-family 
homes with horse corrals in Paramount's only residential area zoned for 
equestrian use. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the City Council unanimously approved a zoning amendment for 
keeping horses in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Developer Michael Fierro of Hollydale is proposing to build the homes on 2 1/2 
acres of vacant land on the south side of Century Boulevard between Orange 
Avenue and the Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new regulations, each home can have no more than four horses and the 
horse stalls must have direct access to the county bridle trail along the 
river. Corrals must also be at least 40 feet from the homes. Homeowners are 
allowed to board animals belonging only to them. 
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, protests from residents stopped a developer's proposal to 
construct apartments on the land, said Pat West, deputy city manager. There has 
been no protest on the latest proposal.

FINDLAY FAMILY STAYS IN SWIM; 
</P>
<P>
LIFEGUARD HABIT COMES NATURALLY, GENERATION UPON GENERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA MEARS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If a movie were made about the Findlay family, it would have to be called "They 
Came From the Sea" and, unlike the dismal B-grade flicks that the title 
suggests, this film would get a sparkling "G" rating, worthy of Disney himself. 
</P>
<P>
And if an argument were made that lifeguards are made, not born, 20-year-old 
Sean Findlay could contradict it simply by showing the family photo album. 
</P>
<P>
Findlay, a Camarillo resident and Ventura College student, is the most recent 
member of his family to ascend California state beach lifeguard towers, 
following a tradition begun by his great-grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
Findlay, an assistant coach for Camarillo's Pleasant Valley swimming team 
during winter months, cannot remember when he did not know how to swim. "When 
my mom and I weren't at the beach with my dad, we were at my grandparents' 
pool," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Sean's father, Fred Findlay, echoes his son in recounting his own childhood. 
"My father was a part-time lifeguard for the city of Los Angeles back in the 
days of the one-piece tank suit. They didn't have full-time lifeguards then and 
the pay scale wasn't enough to support a family, so my dad worked in the mail 
room at the Los Angeles Times during the week." 
</P>
<P>
But, Fred Findlay recalled, most weekends and all summer he went to "work" with 
his father -- Sean's grandfather -- at Will Rogers State Beach, where Fred 
became a permanent full-time lifeguard and eventually a lieutenant for the L.A. 
City Junior Lifeguard program in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Grew Up Loving Beach' 
</P>
<P>
"I grew up loving the beach," Fred Findlay said. Like his father, he also got a 
job in The Times mail room while attending Pierce College. He recalled the day 
that set his career course. "I went into work at the Times Mirror Building one 
beautiful morning and when I came out eight hours later, the sun was setting. I 
remember thinking, 'I missed this whole beautiful day!' " 
</P>
<P>
It did not happen again. Fred Findlay spent the next 20 years at the beach 
until the Fire Department offered him a position as a paramedic. "I took it 
because it was an opportunity to do something else," he said. "But I still call 
in to lifeguard at Santa Monica Beach a few days a month. All my friends are 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Findlay's grandfather was active in community affairs and, although he was 
not a lifeguard, was enough of a beach-goer to see the need for qualified 
personnel on the beaches. He was instrumental in getting Venice to form an 
ocean lifeguard crew, which was then under the jurisdiction of the police 
department. 
</P>
<P>
Although Sean Findlay said he has not yet decided if lifeguarding will be his 
career, he vows not to work behind a desk. "It will definitely be an 
ocean-oriented career," he said. "I'm hoping to attend California Maritime 
Academy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Best of All Worlds 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, being a lifeguard is, for both Fred and Sean Findlay, the best 
of all possible worlds. "Where else can we make a living doing something we 
love?" Fred Findlay asked. "Unless you're Mark Spitz, there's no great 
after-market for swimmers. People work indoors all week and the first place 
they hit on weekends is the beach. When kids get out of school, the first place 
they head is the beach. We're at the beach all the time. The only difference is 
we have a much greater responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Sean Findlay agreed. "I like everything about being a lifeguard, and I get paid 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
Do lifeguards always get the girl? "Well," he said with a laugh, "I'm not sure. 
The first girl I ever cared about I got -- and kept. But that was at a pool. 
Does that count?" 
</P>

REDONDO PIER BUSINESSES SLOWLY RECOVER FROM DEVASTATING 1988 STORMS AND FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB WILLIAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It was a year of disasters," said Redondo Beach Pier shop owner Judy Milner, 
recalling the 1988 fire and ocean storms that destroyed nearly half of the 
horseshoe-shaped structure. "But we're hard-core pier people, so we survive and 
go on." 
</P>
<P>
Milner's Pier Imports was heavily damaged when 20-foot waves, driven by an 
Arctic storm, rolled into King Harbor in Redondo Beach in January, 1988, and 
smashed into the 60-year-old pier. A few months later, in May, she and her 
husband, Chuck, lost four smaller shops in The Edge restaurant when a fire 
consumed that pier building. 
</P>
<P>
To replace her lost outlets -- and show her faith in the pier's future -- 
Milner is remodeling the former Port of Spain restaurant into another gift 
shop. She said it will feature a mounted 16-foot great white shark. 
</P>
<P>
The May 27 fire, which apparently started in storm-damaged electrical wiring 
under the pier, destroyed 16 of the 48 pier businesses, including the Breakers 
and Cattleman's restaurants. Damage to public and private property was 
estimated at up to $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
It was the third disaster that year, including an April storm that dropped a 
155-foot pier walkway into the ocean. No businesses were on that section, which 
was used for fishing and as a promenade. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Saloon to Rebuild 
</P>
<P>
The pier is part of King Harbor, where total damage exceeded $26 million. 
Recovery in the harbor so far includes the restoration of the Portofino Inn and 
Reuben's restaurant. The Blue Moon Saloon, which was destroyed, plans to 
rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
After the pier was cleaned up, 90% of the businesses reopened. Merchants say 
their business has declined and attribute that to a widespread belief that the 
Redondo Beach Pier no longer exists, and they say the pier, and its lost 
sections, need to be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
"People saw these pictures on TV and in the newspapers showing the pier in 
flames and got the impression that everything was lost," said Randy Joe, owner 
of the Sunshine Kite Co. "It's taking a long time to get the word out that 
we're still here." 
</P>
<P>
Joe said the fire last year destroyed his building and his stock of kites. "For 
awhile there, I didn't know whether I'd ever get back in business," said Joe, 
who started the kite company 15 years ago when he was only 19. 
</P>
<P>
But a month after the fire, the city's Harbor Department set up a "Survivors 
Village" near the pier entrance. It provided blue-and-white tents from which 
Joe and several other small business owners could operate until permanent 
structures are built. 
</P>
<P>
"That made it possible for us to hang on," Joe said. "I worked really hard to 
get my customers back." Three months ago, he moved from his tent into a 
portable building that an architect friend designed for him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Lost Revenue 
</P>
<P>
Harbor Director Sheila Schoettger said the 1988 disasters cost the pier 
merchants $4.6 million in lost business from 1987 when total revenue was $17.7 
million, and the city's rental income fell about 30%, a $600,000 loss, largely 
because of reduced attendance. 
</P>
<P>
"The last months of 1988 were especially terrible," she said. "The crowds 
weren't there and some of the merchants were having a hard time paying their 
bills. But in the last few months, business has really picked up." 
</P>
<P>
The Fourth of July weekend, combined with hot, smoggy weather, brought out 
large crowds, she said. "The pier business is totally dependent on the 
weather," she said. "If it's hot inland, people head for the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Although optimistic about their short-term survival, merchants say the pier can 
never be the same -- or better -- until it is rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
"Even when we have good crowds, people don't circulate the way they did when 
they could walk around the Horseshoe," said Milner of Pier Imports, indicating 
an 800-foot gap in the central portion of the pier. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pedestrian Traffic Limited 
</P>
<P>
The southern side of the Horseshoe survived, along with a short leg on the 
north end that is no longer in use. Pedestrian traffic flow is further 
restricted by the loss in April of the fishing promenade that once connected 
the ocean side of the Horseshoe to the nearby Monstad Pier. 
</P>
<P>
The Monstad Pier otherwise escaped major damage, but merchants there say their 
business also has been hit hard by reduced attendance. Ernest Kim, manager of 
the Redondo Beach Coffee Shop at the end of the Monstad, said his business had 
been down 30% to 40%, until picking up in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
"Weather is the primary factor," he said. "No problem as long as the weather is 
hot." 
</P>
<P>
Newcomer Don Stinson said uncertainty over the pier's future in the wake of the 
1988 disasters caused him at first to rethink his plans to convert the old 
China Queen restaurant at the pier's entrance to Sinbad's, a seafood and steak 
restaurant similar to one he and his brother own in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's such a tremendous area," Stinson said. "We decided to go ahead with 
our plans and we haven't regretted it." 
</P>
<P>
He said Sinbad's business has steadily increased since it opened seven months 
ago, with about 60% of the patronage coming from area residents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
International Boardwalk 
</P>
<P>
Storm-driven waves caused some water damage along the International Boardwalk, 
a complex of 23 onshore businesses north of the pier parking structure. "We had 
six inches of water in here," said Heidi Von Goerlitz, office manager for the 
Fun Factory, an amusement arcade that has been in business at the pier for 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief shutdown, the boardwalk businesses, like those on the pier, were 
back in operation -- and waiting for the crowds to return. "We're advertising 
to let people know that we're still here, and business is beginning to pick 
up," Von Goerlitz said. "But last year was really slow." 
</P>
<P>
Pier Properties, the largest of three leaseholders that rent buildings to 
individual businesses, lost 70% of its structures in the 1988 disasters, said 
general partner Jay Robinson. "I had 30 tenants before it all happened," he 
said. "Now I've got 11." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said he has survived many storms since he acquired his lease from the 
city in 1962. "But in the past, we just repaired the damage and got everybody 
back in business," he said. "Now we have to wait for the city to build a new 
pier. I wish they'd get on with it."

BATEMAN TO TRY LUCK AS A WALK-ON AT UCLA

<TEXT>
<P>
Morgan Bateman of Crescenta Valley High, who placed third in the boys' 800 
meters in the state championships at Cerritos College last month, will attend 
UCLA in the fall and try to make the track and field team as a walk-on. 
</P>
<P>
Bateman chose UCLA over a partial scholarship at Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
"I just felt like UCLA would offer me more opportunities," Bateman said. "I 
felt like I would be exposed to a wider variety of cultures there." 
</P>
<P>
Primarily an 800 runner in high school -- he placed third, first and third in 
the 800 at the Southern Section 4-A Division championships the last three years 
-- Bateman said he would probably step up to the 1,500 in college. 
</P>
<P>
Bateman ran bests of 1 minute, 53.94 seconds as a sophomore, 1:52.66 as a 
junior and 1:52.20 as a senior. The final time placed him fourth in the Golden 
West Invitational at Hughes Stadium in Sacramento last month. 
</P>
<P>
Junior titles: Three junior competitors from the Glendale area won titles in 
their respective age divisions last weekend at the National Public Parks Tennis 
championships in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Evangeline Olivares of Eagle Rock won the girls' 18-and-under division by 
defeating Quynh Le of Torrance, 6-0, 6-3; Martin Escos of Glendale won the 
boys' 16-and under championship by defeating Vanig Kasabian of Torrance, 6-1, 
3-6, 6-1; and Chong Rae Cho of Glendale won the boys' 14-and under title by 
defeating Gianandrea Marcaccini of Tarzana, 6-2, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
All-star football: Four recently graduated Glendale-area high school players 
will participate in the Daily News All-Star Football Game on Friday at 7:30 
p.m. at Birmingham High in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Plaisance of Village Christian and Jeff Engilman of Sylmar are the coaches 
for the 38-player East team. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale-area players include Greg Thompson of La Canada, Jeff Dyrek of St. 
Francis, and Greg Lloyd and Kevin Ebenhoch of Village Christian. 
</P>
<P>
Hot on the trail: Tom Kendall of La Canada drove a Cars and Concept Chevy 
Beretta to a runner-up finish Sunday at a Sports Club Car of America TransAm 
championship race in Des Moines, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Kendall, 23, is second in the SCCA TransAm season standings with 74 points. He 
trails series leader Dorsey Schroeder by six points. 
</P>
<P>
At Des Moines, Kendall finished second for the third time this season. He also 
has one third, one fourth and one 19th-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
The next race in the TransAm series is July 23 in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
Camp crazy: The following is a list of youth sports camps that will be 
conducted during the next few weeks in the Glendale area:

MANY HOMELESS BY CHOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Grant Craig (Glendale Section Letters, July 6) takes Ginger Bremberg to 
task for her comments on the homeless. I missed the article. However, his 
quotation of her remarks makes it difficult for me to see his point or argue 
with her. 
</P>
<P>
As to the point about the homeless not being there by choice, well, Charles my 
friend, you need some "non-pathetic enlightenment." Certainly there are some 
who are victims of circumstance. However, he needs to look at the makeup of the 
600,000 (not the media/liberal-hyped million or million and a half). U.S. News 
&amp; World Report (March 20) reported that 33% to 38% are alcoholics, 13% to 
25% are drug users and 21% to 24% have served prison time or have a felony 
conviction. Daily News Digest, Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Those who are mentally ill used to be cared for by the state but someone 
decided we shouldn't be "warehousing" them and depriving them of their freedom. 
</P>
<P>
There is a problem; the answers are difficult, but recognize that many are 
there by choice.

LIBRARIES GET HELP FROM CELEBRITIES TO ENTICE READERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Wild About Reading," the summer program to encourage recreational reading 
among children of all ages, is under way through August in all 91 branches of 
the Los Angeles County Public Library system. 
</P>
<P>
Surveys were conducted in the libraries to find out who children admire most. 
National and local celebrities named in the surveys were then asked to send a 
picture and letter to post in all libraries. The responses are now on view in 
all the libraries to encourage children to write the celebrities in keeping 
with the theme, "Reading and Writing Go Together." 
</P>
<P>
Television weatherman George Fischbeck, professional wrestler Hulk Hogan, 
basketball star Magic Johnson and First Lady Barbara Bush are a few of the 
celebrities who responded. 
</P>
<P>
Pentel of America is co-sponsoring the program and is providing stationery and 
pens for all participating children. Pentel has cooperated with the library 
system since 1980 on various projects for children, and each year helps sponsor 
the library's bookmark contest. 
</P>
<P>
The county library's summer reading program has been going since 1931.

CITY SATISFIED WITH ANTI-DISCRIMINATION STATEMENT; 
</P>
<P>
AVALON LETS TUNA CLUB OFF THE HOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Avalon city officials, after months of inquiry, have accepted assurances by the 
all-male Tuna Club that the club does not discriminate against women. 
</P>
<P>
At an Avalon City Council meeting attended by Tuna Club President Jim Martin 
and other club members, City Atty. Michael Jenkins told the council that 
letters to the city from the Tuna Club, most recently on June 9, had resolved 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview, Jenkins said the city had requested assurances that the club 
"will not discriminate in their membership policies, business practices and the 
operation of their facilities. We asked them to affirm that that would be their 
policy, and they have done that, and we are satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
Jenkins said the club "has taken a position consistent with the position that 
we asked them to take." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Discrimination Statement 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the city March 14, Martin had said the club did not discriminate 
"on the basis of race, sex, religion or national origin in its membership 
policies and practices." 
</P>
<P>
But city officials insisted that the club's nondiscrimination policy must also 
extend to the operation of the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Chuck Prince said the June 9 letter "basically says uncle. It says 
we assure you that we don't discriminate in our practices and in our 
membership. The council and city officials felt that the letter was 
satisfactory." 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Martin said that although the club's board of directors 
considered the use of club facilities a private matter, the board had 
nonetheless directed him to assure the city that the club "does not and will 
not discriminate in the operation and utilization of the club facilities 
(except for restrooms, shower rooms and changing rooms) on the basis of sex, 
race, religion and national origin." 
</P>
<P>
Martin was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Club Leases Building 
</P>
<P>
The 91-year-old private sportfishing club, on Santa Catalina Island ocean-front 
property, leases its facilities from the city for $4,800 a year under a 10-year 
lease that expires in December. 
</P>
<P>
The city's inquiry into the club's operation began last October, when City 
Councilwoman Irene Strobel asked that the city investigate whether the club 
restricted its membership to men and, if so, whether leasing publicly owned 
land to such a group would violate state and federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of letters sent to the city, club officials said the club does not 
prohibit women from becoming members. 
</P>
<P>
To join the club, prospective members must be nominated for associate 
membership by a current member, club officials said. To advance to active 
membership, an associate member must catch a fish exceeding a certain weight, 
depending on the kind of fish. 
</P>
<P>
The club has fewer than 200 members, most of whom live on the mainland, club 
officials said. Some members maintain vacation homes on the island, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Strobel said the city and the club had come a long way toward resolving the 
issue but that she was concerned about how the city would monitor whether the 
club restricted women. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess I'm going to have to keep trucking forward on this," said Strobel, the 
only female council member. "They have agreed not to discriminate, and that's 
an important step forward. I'm hoping there will be a mechanism to allow the 
city to monitor and enforce this nondiscrimination requirement." 
</P>
<P>
Prince said the city would investigate any reports of sexual discrimination at 
the club. 
</P>
<P>
Club officials have notified the city of their intent to renew the lease for 
another 10 years, Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
Prince, Mayor Hugh T. (Bud) Smith and Councilman Hal Host plan to meet with 
club officials within the next few months to discuss the terms of the lease, 
Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to talk to them a little about the price, who maintains the club in 
case it's damaged by a storm, and access, being open on a from time-to-time 
basis for community groups and citizens to use," Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
The white, New England-style building was heavily damaged in a storm in 
January, 1988. Club members are paying for those repairs, a member said. 
</P>
<P>
Strobel said the opening of club facilities for some city-sanctioned functions 
would be a good-will gesture that would serve the community and the club.

RECALL LEADERS CLAIM 5,000 SIGNATURES, BUT OTHER GROUPS REFUSE TO GIVE SUPPORT

WHITTIER 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of gun enthusiasts claims to have gathered about two-thirds of the 
signatures needed to force the entire City Council into a recall election, but 
so far it apparently has failed to woo the support of other community 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for the Whittier Voters Coalition, which includes members of the 
National Rifle Assn., last week announced that they had collected about 5,000 
signatures on petitions that condemn the council's four-month-old ban on the 
sale and possession of semiautomatic assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The city statute will become moot after January, when the statewide law against 
assault weapons takes effect, City Manager Thomas Mauk said. 
</P>
<P>
The petitions also accuse Mayor Victor A. Lopez and Councilmen Gene Chandler, 
Myron Claxton, Thomas K. Sawyer and Robert M. Woehrmann of "abuse of power" for 
failing to limit widespread apartment construction in this 12-square-mile city. 
</P>
<P>
"We're convinced that we need a new City Council," said Whittier Voters 
Coalition head Paul Schwemler at a planning session recently, "one that is 
sensitive to the needs and wants of the citizens of the city of Whittier." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confidence Expressed 
</P>
<P>
The councilmen, in telephone interviews, stood by their decision to outlaw 
military-type assault weapons. They said they were confident that the coalition 
will not be able to collect enough signatures to force a recall election. 
</P>
<P>
"I am confident in the citizens of Whittier," said Lopez, who added that he has 
lived in the community for 50 years. He said the council "did the right thing" 
by unanimously passing the anti-assault weapon ordinance in March. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier Voters Coalition has until 5 p.m. Aug. 22 to deliver the 
signatures of 7,500 registered voters to City Clerk Gertrude L. Hill. The 
signature-gathering is the second step in the lengthy process to call a special 
election. Once the petitions are delivered, the city clerk has 30 days to 
certify the signatures. 
</P>
<P>
Schwemler and 26 other gun advocates met at the La Mirada Library to rally 
support of other activists who may be dissatisfied with the council. But no 
other community organization sent a representative. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview before the meeting, Schwemler said leaders of the 
Whittier Peace Coalition, the Whittier Conservancy, the Mark Twain Democratic 
Club and the Parent Teachers Assn. had joined the recall effort of the Whittier 
Voters Coalition and would attend the planning session. 
</P>
<P>
The La Mirada Library was chosen so the various groups, who disagree on a 
variety of subjects, would meet on "neutral ground," Schwemler said. The 
meeting was advertised in a local newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a common objective here," Schwemler said. "We're putting our 
differences aside for a common goal. Our dissatisfaction with the City Council 
is as uniform as it can be." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deny Supporting Coalition 
</P>
<P>
But in telephone interviews, leaders of the other organizations denied that 
they support the recall or the goals of the Whittier Voters Coalition. Some of 
them claimed that they were never invited to the meeting, and questioned the 
motives of the Whittier Voters Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
"They have tried to align themselves with our group and causes before," said 
Mike Sullens, president of the Whittier Conservancy, a nonprofit organization 
that has been critical of housing development and proposals to tear down 
several historical buildings, including the Whittier Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand why they keep insisting" that the two groups have joined 
together to oust the council, Sullens said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerald Haynes, a member of the Whittier Peace Coalition, said none of the 
group's members have been working with the pro-gun group. "It would be safe to 
say that our members generally agree with the gun-control (ordinance). I'm not 
quite clear where the (gun advocates) are coming from." 
</P>
<P>
And Councilman Claxton disagrees with charges that he and the other council 
members are out of touch with their constituents and repeatedly ignore them. He 
pointed to the pro-gun group's apparent failure to gather the support of 
leaders of some other community groups. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just wishful thinking for them to assume that others will join their 
cause," Claxton said. 
</P>
<P>
But Schwemler shrugged off the lack of response by leaders of other community 
groups to his group's recall effort. "There are a lot of people out there who 
support this for different reasons," he stressed. "If they (the leaders) want 
to work with us fine. If they don't fine." 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier Voters Coalition began its petition drive in April after the 
council joined a growing number of government agencies in condemning 
semiautomatic weapons. After five schoolchildren in Stockton were killed in 
January by a man using a semiautomatic assault weapon, more than a dozen cities 
-- including Los Angeles, Carson and Beverly Hills -- passed restrictions on 
such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
State lawmakers have also passed restrictions on military-type weapons, but the 
Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors narrowly rejected one for 
unincorporated county areas. 
</P>
<P>
In the Southeast area, Compton, Long Beach and Lynwood have also passed a 
variety of laws against assault weapons. Bellflower council members had 
considered passage of one in February, but never voted.

TARVER TO PASS ON CHOOSING A COLLEGE EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sean Waters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't expect Santa Clara High's Shon Tarver to accept a college basketball 
scholarship during the early signing period in November. 
</P>
<P>
Tarver, last season's State Division IV Player of the Year, plans to wait until 
after his senior basketball season before making a decision, according to Santa 
Clara Coach Lou Cvijanovich. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to push him to sign early," Cvijanovich said. "I think it takes the 
pressure off the kid and allows him a chance to be a human being during his 
senior year. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's not going to happen. He wants to take his time and explore his 
options." 
</P>
<P>
Cvijanovich experienced similar recruiting battles when his son Stacy 
Cvijanovich and Joe Wallace were seniors at Santa Clara. He said the whole 
process can be a major headache. 
</P>
<P>
Tarver, who averaged 22.1 points as a junior, is currently being showcased at 
the Nike Camp in Princeton, N. J., where only the top players in the nation are 
invited. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara, meanwhile, finished fourth in the Carson tournament and was 
eliminated in the consolation second round of the Fairfax tournament last 
weekend without Tarver in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Add Tarver: Faced with a younger, smaller starting lineup, Cvijanovich is 
experimenting with the idea of moving the 6-5 Tarver from small forward to 
point or off guard. The move would give the Saints a more experienced 
ball-handler and, hopefully, create matchup problems for opposing defenses. 
</P>
<P>
Second thoughts: Reg Welker decided a move from Hueneme High to the junior 
college level was not enough incentive to continue coaching baseball and he 
backed out of his decision to become the new coach at Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
Welker informed Don Brockett, the Oxnard athletic director, of his decision 
Friday one week after accepting the new position. His selection was awaiting 
approval by the Ventura County Community College District, which was scheduled 
to make a decision Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I lost my enthusiasm and interest in coaching," Welker said. "I thought a new 
job would help, but it didn't. It had nothing to do with Oxnard or its 
administration. It was because of personal problems. I have been considering 
quitting coaching for the past two years." 
</P>
<P>
Welker said he will remain a teacher and the athletic director at Hueneme, but 
will not return as the school's baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
Brockett said he was caught off guard by Welker's decision, especially since 
most of the formalities had been worked out. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes it caught me by surprise," Brockett said. "We had worked out all the 
details with his school district and had a practice schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Young and promising: Moorpark High continues to corner the market on junior 
varsity coaches with potential to run a varsity program. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Rhoades became the third hire in slightly more than a year without varsity 
coaching experience when he was selected as the new Moorpark baseball coach. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoades, who has been the school's junior varsity coach, succeeds Mario Porto, 
who resigned to become an assistant at Moorpark College. Rhoades had a 
three-year of 30-21 record, and led the Musketeers to the Tri-Valley League 
championship last season. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Moorpark hired Rob Dearborn as football coach, and Tim Bednar was 
selected as boys' basketball program last month. Neither had varsity 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
Rhoades, 27, played baseball at Pepperdine where he received his degree in 
1983. He also played minor league baseball in Walla Walla, Washington in the 
Class-A Northwest League and toured with Athletes in Action. 
</P>
<P>
Hot stuff: The biggest problem facing Coach Rick Scott and the Buena High 
football team was finding a wide receiver for standout senior quarterback Jason 
Isaacs to throw to. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Isaacs teamed with receiver Jim Collins to form one of the most 
dangerous passing combinations in the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, however, thinks he has found a receiver that's not only as tall as 
Collins, but faster. 
</P>
<P>
His name -- James Craft. 
</P>
<P>
"He's lightning fast," Scott said about Craft, a 5-9, 155-pound senior. "He's 
just as tall as Jim but not quite as big." 
</P>
<P>
Bayou Bound: Shane Espitia, who pitched for Ventura College last season, will 
receive a half scholarship to continue his baseball career at Nicholls State 
University in Thibodaux, La. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt they had a good program and I needed a chance to get away," Espitia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Espitia had a 8-3 record and a 2.86 earned-run average for the Pirates last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Staying home -- Adan Valencia, who was an All-Channel League selection at Buena 
high, will play basketball at Cal Lutheran. Valencia, a 6-6 forward, averaged 
16 points and 11 rebounds a game as a senior.

RUGGED SPORT OF RIDE AND TIE RECALLS TRADITIONS OF ANOTHER ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN McALPINE, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last Sunday, about the time most people were rubbing the sleep from their eyes, 
John Melville was blinking back something else. Dust. A sky full of it. 
</P>
<P>
For Melville, however, the dust was a mere hindrance. The real challenge lay 
ahead, where the open field funneled to a small gap in a wall of pines -- 
hardly room enough for the 90 horses and riders charging across the field 
kicking up a smoke screen. Instead of racing for the gap, Melville, 69, slowed 
his mount to a trot, dropping back into the gritty haze. 
</P>
<P>
Ride and tie may be a sport for the brash, but it's not for the reckless. 
</P>
<P>
Melville, of Ojai, was one of 300 individualistic souls (including horses) who 
gathered in Frazier Park, just south of the Kern County line, last weekend to 
compete in the 19th Ride and Tie World Championships -- a raucous, dusty, homey 
affair mixing horses, humans and a rash of intangibles. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes a sporting event back to the fundamentals," said David Taylor, a 
50-year-old ride-and-tier from Salt Lake City. "In ride and tie, you dispense 
with the creature comforts. You're dealing with sweat and dust and 
rattlesnakes. You go back to the last century." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, you go back two centuries. Ride and tie traces its origins at least as 
far back as 18th-Century England, where writer Henry Fielding documented a trip 
made by two men who, short tuppence, were forced to share a horse on their 
120-mile trip to London. The impoverished Englishmen were not the only ones to 
make such a trip; in the 19th-Century American West, the ride and tie was a 
common form of travel. 
</P>
<P>
"One person would hitch the horse to a tree and hike on until his partner came 
up to the hitched horse," said Steve Shaw, a top-notch ride-and-tier. "They 
would share the horse by hitching and hiking into town." 
</P>
<P>
But today's ride-and-tie bears little resemblance to the leisurely strolls of 
the past. Shaw calls ride and tie "a combination horse race, a long-distance 
marathon and a chess game." 
</P>
<P>
Lightweight saddles, pure-bred horses and complex strategy play a role. But 
ride and tie has by no means been reduced to an antiseptic science. Runners 
accidently speed past horses, horses run off without riders, and riders get 
bucked off without ceremony, making for a wild and woolly affair. One 
competitor carved his place in ride-and-tie history by pursuing through the 
brush what he thought was his horse, only to find he was chasing a bear. 
</P>
<P>
Contested over 36 miles of rough trail, the competition last weekend was not 
without its accidents. John Loeschhorn of Irvine, a top-notch runner but a very 
green rider, teamed with Judy Cummings of Anaheim to win Saturday's novice 
event. Buoyed by this success, Loeschhorn entered Sunday's competition, teaming 
with an unfamiliar partner and, more importantly, an unfamiliar horse. Five 
miles into the race, Loeschhorn and 900 pounds of overeager mount ran headlong 
into a barbed-wire fence. 
</P>
<P>
"He went through the barbed-wire fence, I stopped at the barbed-wire fence," 
said Loeschhorn, who, despite stitches in his face and neck, remained upbeat. 
"I'm lucky to be alive." 
</P>
<P>
Most mistakes were less serious, although no less frustrating. Afraid he had 
run past his horse, Ed Butrovich, a 27-year-old Newbury Park competitor, turned 
back 20 yards short of his mount. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he was tied at the bottom of the hill, but no horse," he said. "So I 
ran uphill for five minutes, no horse. I ran back down the hill, no horse. I 
thought, 'OK, maybe somebody else is riding my horse.' 
</P>
<P>
"We lost 10 minutes, but, hey, that's all part of the race." 
</P>
<P>
Butrovich and partner Jeff Herten were among Sunday's 60 finishing teams. 
Approximately 30 other teams were disqualified at the race's three veterinarian 
checkpoints after vets determined it was no longer safe for the horses to 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
"We always err in favor of the horse," said Jim Steele, the head veterinarian, 
who monitored everything from lameness to dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
The vet checkpoints play perhaps the most important role in the competition. In 
an outburst of frenzied activity, loyal crews of family and friends work to 
calm and cool the horse, lowering the animal's pulse to the requisite rate of 
72 beats per minute. Again, methodology varies widely, a mix of horse sense and 
science. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody has their own strategy," Shaw said. "Let the horse eat a little, 
drink, sponge him down. Some people even spray them down with enormous bottles. 
Anything and everything to make sure they pass the vet check." 
</P>
<P>
And how do you monitor the runners? 
</P>
<P>
"We're on our own, we should know better," said Shaw, laughing. "We do have 
medical personnel available, but if anything, we should do a psychological 
profile." 
</P>
<P>
Ride-and-tiers are the first to admit that the sport requires what one rider 
calls, "a certain degree of zaniness." However, just being off-center has its 
own rewards. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most fun you can have with your clothes on," said Chuck Jones, a 
premier ultra-distance runner who took up ride and tie six years ago and was 
promptly thrown in his first race. "I knew right then that this was the sport 
for me." 
</P>
<P>
Others agree, although not necessarily for the same reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"This sport is responsible for my health, my well-being and my focus in life," 
said Wayne Hindrichs, moments after he and partner Mark Richtman won Sunday's 
event in 4 hours, 24 minutes -- one minute ahead of the runner-up team of Con 
and Tod Wadsworth. "I've done a million things, but I guarantee you, there's no 
sport that's this much fun." 
</P>
<P>
Also among the finishers was Melville. Coated in dust, but no worse for wear, 
Melville and partners Peter Moock (human) and Doc's Shadow (equine) finished in 
7 hours, 5 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"It should have been under seven hours," Melville said. "But it was still a 
hell of a good ride."

CORY KRUSEMAN DISCOVERS RACING SUCCESS AT 18 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL OLSON, Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While most high school seniors were readying for graduation and parties a 
couple of weeks ago, Buena High's Cory Kruseman was racing stock cars and 
three-quarter midgets at Ventura Raceway, Ascot and Oildale, a track near 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Kruseman, 18, a former junior varsity quarterback, decided to forgo football 
and the normal teen-age life to pursue his burning desire to be behind the 
wheel of a powerful racing machine -- any kind of powerful racing machine. 
</P>
<P>
Kruseman has actually been racing since age 11, starting on the Go-Kart and 
motocross circuits around the Southland. He has been around race tracks from 
the time he began to walk. 
</P>
<P>
Kruseman's introduction to racing came on the three-quarter midget circuit 
through his father, the late Ron "Krazy" Kruseman, who was killed during a 1984 
TQ (three-quarter midget) race at El Centro. 
</P>
<P>
"I've hung around TQs all my life. I was the little guy always hanging around, 
helping out and getting tools and things for anyone, but I lost interest for 
about a year after my dad was killed," Cory Kruseman said. 
</P>
<P>
"I got motivated again because racing is where my friends are, and I can do 
what I want to do." 
</P>
<P>
Kruseman always wanted to pursue his father's dream in a TQ car. He began 
chasing the goal for real in January -- saving money, trying to sell his 1969 
El Camino, and borrowing $6,500 from his mother, Renee Kruseman. 
</P>
<P>
That gave him just enough money to purchase a used TQ from Bill Floyd of 
Oxnard, who no longer races in the division but is still active racing 
Mini-Stocks at Ventura. Floyd and Kruseman now go head-to-head in that 
division, thanks to Don Adams of the Auto Dienst, a car-service center in 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known his mom for several years and I have seen him drive Go-Karts a lot 
and I think he has a lot of natural talent," Adams said. "I prepared a stock 
car this year and I needed a driver, so I asked him if he would like to drive a 
stock car." 
</P>
<P>
The youthful Kruseman thought he was getting only a one- or two-week tryout 
until Adams found a permanent driver. But Adams told him after the third week 
that the No. 73 red-and-white Pinto 2000 Mini-Stock was his for the season. 
</P>
<P>
"This was something I always wanted, to set a goal and try to conquer it," 
Kruseman said. "I'm trying to form my ladder to the Indy 500, and I hope my 
racing doesn't just become a step stool." 
</P>
<P>
Comments from some interested observers indicate that Kruseman could very well 
be climbing that ladder. 
</P>
<P>
"All young drivers create excitement, but he's not intimidated by the old guys 
and he's got a lot of energy that makes him a good little racer," Ventura 
Raceway promoter Jim Naylor said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Adams: "He made an impression in his first TQ race at Oildale in June. The 
drivers and track officials were impressed by his abilities and they told me 
the rookie flag won't be staying on his car for very long." 
</P>
<P>
Kruseman has been improving weekly at Ventura. Currently 12th in the Ventura 
Mini-Stock standings with 420 points, Kruseman registered the first main-event 
victory of his career two weeks ago. He won his first trophy dash the same 
night and added his second main-event win last Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I kinda lucked into the win," Kruseman said of the first victory. "I usually 
don't run in the figure 8 race, but I was having some car trouble and we ran in 
the figure 8 to see if the bugs were out of it and I ended up getting the win." 
</P>
<P>
While the dream moves closer and closer to reality every time Kruseman steers 
onto the dirt and asphalt ovals, he credits the desire and encouragement to 
succeed to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
"It kind of bugs my mom at times and she has to be by herself when I'm racing," 
Kruseman said. "It's hard for her, especially since one of our best friends, 
Jeff Bagley, was killed in a Sprint car at Ascot last month. It has bothered 
her a lot, but at the same time she accepts my racing and she supports me 
100%." 
</P>
<P>
Also lending support to Kruseman is his mother's boyfriend and Sprint car 
driver, Harlan Willis of Ventura. Kruseman said Willis is teaching him how to 
set up the cars for different tracks and is working with him on his racing 
psychology. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a lot of experience in TQs and Sprints and I try to help him have the 
right attitudes on the track," Willis said. "I try to keep him from being 
overly aggressive and from driving over his head." 
</P>
<P>
The one-fifth-mile dirt oval at Ventura has opened the door for Kruseman and he 
has a soft spot in his heart for the track. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people don't know it, but Ventura is a real nice track," Kruseman 
said. "I remember when it was a little mudhole, but it turned into a great 
track and hopefully it can be better than Ascot someday. It's a fast track, so 
I hope they might run more TQs here in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'll drive anything on this track in a race." 
</P>

UTTS EASILY STREET STOCK POINTS LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL OLSON, Special to the Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the midway point of the Mini Stock and Street Stock racing season at Ventura 
Raceway, three Camarillo area drivers are leading in three of the four points 
standing categories. 
</P>
<P>
The most dominant driver in the Street Stock division is Camarillo's Charles 
Utts, who has opened up a commanding lead over Jeff Bosley of Camarillo. Utts 
has 1,655 points followed by Bosley with 975. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Utts has won three main events, four heat races, six trophy 
dashes, and has recorded nine fast qualifying times, including a Street Stock 
track record of 16.38. Utts, a four-year veteran at Ventura, could have even 
more wins, but he has chosen to race only in oval track events this year while 
forgoing the figure 8 series. 
</P>
<P>
Bosley leads the Street Stock figure 8 division with a slight lead over Jim 
Firsich, 1,190 points to 1,020. Hume still holds onto third with 740 points but 
Ventura's Scott Olsen is closing in with 670 points. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo's Gary Curtis has turned in some impressive performance's in the Mini 
Stock series. Curtis has 15 main event victories, with nine on the oval track 
and six in figure 8 racing. In addition, he has four heat race and two trophy 
dash wins and five quick times. 
</P>
<P>
Curtis leads with 1,485 points in the Mini Stock division followed closely by 
Rock Ake, Jr. of Moorpark with 1,330. Ventura's Marty Desbrow and Chris Rasche 
are third and fourth with 1,115 and 1,025 points. 
</P>
<P>
Ake's six Mini Stocks figure 8 main-event wins has staked him to the points 
lead in that division with 1,420 points. In addition, Ake also has two oval 
track main event and two trophy dash victories.

PARIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two hundred years ago this Friday, a mob of Parisians that included wine 
merchants, cabinet makers, a brewer, a laundress and an 8-year-old boy sparked 
the French Revolution by storming the Bastille Prison. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the site is marked for eternity by a plaque above La Divine pizzeria in 
the Place de la Bastille: "Seized by the people on July 14, 1789, and 
demolished the same year." 
</P>
<P>
For its part, the pizza parlor is getting into the spirit of things with a $50 
special menu that concludes with "Bicentennial sherbet." 
</P>
<P>
The French government, meanwhile, will combine its huge Bastille Day party this 
year with the annual Group of Seven summit meeting. President Francois 
Mitterrand hopes to dazzle the leaders from the world's leading industrial 
democracies, including President Bush, with a stunning presentation of 
futuristic architecture and a $15-million parade. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, the leaders are invited to the inaugural concert in the 
glass-sheathed, $400-million Bastille Opera, the world's most technologically 
advanced musical theater. On Friday, they meet to open the summit at the new 
$300-million addition to the Louvre museum. On Saturday, they convene to 
discuss the world economy in the new $500-million, marble-and-glass Arc de La 
Defense that rises above a forest of skyscrapers on the edge of Paris in a 
direct line with the Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe. 
</P>
<P>
The message is clear: The Bourbon kings and the Napoleonic Age had their 
monuments. We have ours. Move over, Ozymandias. Look on our works, ye mighty, 
and . . . marvel. 
</P>
<P>
The downtrodden postwar France of myth and movie -- represented by a 
mustachioed man on a bicycle, wearing a beret and carrying a long loaf of bread 
under his arm -- no longer exists. Neither does the mythical France of style 
without substance, an elegant land of haute couture where the phones do not 
work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tremendous Changes 
</P>
<P>
"Many people," said Bernard Vernier-Palliez, a former French ambassador to the 
United States, "still have the view of France that was based on the discoveries 
made by the American GIs in 1944. To them, France was a country of good food 
and les petites femmes, a highly cultured country but with really antiquated 
industry and no high tech. They don't understand how tremendously France has 
changed." 
</P>
<P>
"The French are no longer French," Oxford University historian Theodore Zeldin 
observed wryly in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Since World War II, few countries have advanced more rapidly and dramatically 
than France. Until the first oil crisis in 1973, its postwar growth rate was 
second only to Japan's. In 50 years, it has converted from a largely 
agricultural nation where 45% of the population lived on farms to an industrial 
and service economy where only 7% of the people still live in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
For 10 years after the oil crisis, from 1973 to 1983, French growth lagged 
behind its European neighbors and the United States. But after the Socialist 
government abandoned its experimentation with traditional leftist economic 
policies in 1983, the economy has again been on the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the French economy is second in Europe, nearly 80% the size of powerful 
West Germany's and fifth in the world. 
</P>
<P>
Sprawling French suburban developments are now barely distinguishable from 
those in California or Texas, boasting giant shopping centers with McDonald's 
and other fast-food outlets flanking the parking lots. One large French 
retailer, Carrefour, has even started exporting its "hypermarkets" to the 
United States, building a store in a Philadelphia suburb. 
</P>
<P>
According to recent surveys, more French now buy their food from these 
American-style markets than from the little shopkeepers with stained aprons 
that figure so prominently in the standard image of France. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Naval, Nuclear Power 
</P>
<P>
The new France is also an independent nuclear power with the world's 
third-largest navy. France is a world leader in fusion and medical research, 
computer software and weapons development. 
</P>
<P>
It is also increasingly a multi-ethnic, multi-religious France. 
</P>
<P>
Many new Frenchmen are named Mohammed or Sharif, speak Arabic as a first 
language and live in the depressing suburban cites outside Paris, Marseilles or 
Lyon. In predominantly North African Arab communities such as Les Minguettes 
near Lyon, France faces major religious and ethnic divisions for the first time 
in its long history of absorbing immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
"It is an explosive situation," said Arezki Dahmani, an ethnic North African 
economist who is president of an Arab political action organization, France 
Plus. "We don't have the outbreaks of violence yet like you had in black 
communities of the United States. But we are starting to have completely 
isolated ghettos where unemployment is 80% and where generations are excluded 
from French society." 
</P>
<P>
With typical French eclat, the French government has attempted to attack this 
emerging ethnic problem by spending millions on accelerated education programs 
and job training programs in troubled areas like Les Minguettes. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in the community say the programs are working. "Les Minguettes is 
more beautiful than ever before," said an Arab teen-ager interviewed on a 
recent afternoon as he stood next to an empty 14-story apartment building, one 
of eight abandoned apartment towers in a section of the community named 
Democracy Square. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Evocative of U.S. Failures 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago the Democracy Square towers, so evocative of similar high-rise 
failures in St. Louis and other American cities, were nests of crime and 
despair. By moving families to less concentrated housing and increasing police 
protection, the government was able to empty the towers without transferring 
the problem to other parts of the community. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime next month, in the context of the summer-long celebration of the 
bicentennial of the French Revolution, the community plans to have demolition 
experts implode the Democracy Square towers at the conclusion of a concert by 
French jazz composer-musician Jean-Michel Jarre. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most dramatic change in France has been the evolution in French 
attitudes toward money and making money. 
</P>
<P>
"The most interesting change," said Prof. Stanley Hoffmann, chairman of Harvard 
University's Center of European Studies, "is the transformation of the French 
business community, which previously was so terribly uncompetitive, anti-social 
and elitist." 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Vernier-Palliez said he first noticed the huge change in his country 
when he returned home in 1984, after his three years as French ambassador to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never spent such a continuous period away from France before," the 
retired diplomat and former chief executive of the Renault automobile company 
recalled. "Coming back, can you imagine my shock when I found a country that 
had completely changed? Contrary to what was in fashion in the late 1970s, free 
enterprise had become something absolutely important." 
</P>
<P>
Vernier-Palliez was amazed to find that flashy businessman Bernard Tapie had 
become a hero to the French people. Tapie is a square-jawed, self-made Parisian 
</P>
<P>
millionaire who never saw the inside of one of the half a dozen elite schools 
that are the usual incubators for the French establishment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Father Was a Mechanic 
</P>
<P>
Tapie proudly points out that his grandmother was a maid in a school. His 
father was a mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
His rags-to-riches autobiography, "To Win," was a runaway best seller. So were 
the romans fric -- cash novels -- of French author Paul Loup Sulitzer, complete 
with their brash English titles: "Money" (1983), "Cash" (1983) and "Fortune" 
(1984). The foreign best-seller list was headed by Chrysler executive Lee 
Iacocca's celebrated autobiography, which French Left Bank intellectuals began 
to discuss with the solemnity and respect previously reserved for the works of 
William Faulkner or James Baldwin. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a century after Americans embraced the same thing, La Belle France -- a 
solidly Roman Catholic country where striving for money was considered sinful 
and where ambition was to land a safe job with one of the giant state 
industries -- was having a torrid love affair with Horatio Alger. 
</P>
<P>
All of a sudden, wrote French sociologist Gerard Mermet in his 1989 book on 
French social trends, "money doesn't smell bad any more." 
</P>
<P>
"To have an entrepreneur as a hero was something unimaginable before," 
Vernier-Palliez said. 
</P>
<P>
"In another time," agreed Tapie, who recently began a political career after 
his lopsided election to the French Parliament from a working-class quarter of 
Marseilles, "it would not have been possible for me to become famous." 
</P>
<P>
Open-shirted, tough-talking Tapie is a polar opposite to button-down, refined 
Vernier-Palliez. Tapie hosted a television show entitled "Ambition." 
</P>
<P>
In Vernier-Palliez's world, ambition, like money, was something seldom 
mentioned aloud. Ambition was vulgar. It smacked of competition, obsession and 
greed, things the French usually prefer to pursue in private. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changes at Schools 
</P>
<P>
No wonder the returning diplomat was stunned when he saw what had happened at 
his distinguished alma mater, Les Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC), from which 
he graduated in 1937. HEC is one of the half a dozen grandes ecoles that have 
traditionally produced the French elite. In the past, mere acceptance at HEC 
meant a guaranteed comfortable future in business or government, usually with 
one of the huge, state-owned industries such as Renault. 
</P>
<P>
Upon his return, however, Vernier-Palliez discovered that a new "entrepreneur 
section" had been created at the school for students who wanted to bypass the 
guaranteed job track and create their own business. The first assignment for 
students in the new section is to parachute out of an airplane -- a test of 
courage and a measure of their willingness to confront the unknown. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the students, like 22-year-old Anne-Sophie Maisonrouge, paralyzed with 
fear, had to be pushed out of the airplane by their instructors. 
</P>
<P>
"But he pushed me too far, and I landed in a field with a bull. Then I was 
really scared," Maisonrouge, now a graduate of HEC, recalled recently. 
</P>
<P>
Most astonishing to many Americans and other visitors who come to France are 
the major technological advances that have arrived here. Only a few years ago, 
the French telephone system was one of the worst in Western Europe. French 
comedian Fernand Reynaud had a whole routine based on the telephone, which 
always included the line of how it was easier to telephone faraway New York 
than the "22 exchange" in the Paris suburb of Asnieres. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Computer Mania 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Reynaud routine would fall flat. France has one of the best phone 
systems in the world and is a leader in fiber-optics communications. It is also 
the home of the astonishing minitel, small computer terminals distributed free 
by the French national telephone company. 
</P>
<P>
"When France makes up her mind to change," Harvard's Hoffmann said, "it can 
happen very, very fast." 
</P>
<P>
Hoffmann, who was born in Vienna and raised in France, likes to tell the story 
of his return to Boston after a year's sabbatical in Paris during 1983-84. 
</P>
<P>
"People asked my impressions of the difference between living in the States and 
living in France," he said. "I told them that public services and practically 
everything else worked better in France -- even the phones." 
</P>
<P>
According to France Telecom, more than 4.5 million of the bread-box-size 
minitel terminals have been installed in French households since 1984. In 
addition to educating entire families in basic computer use, the minitels 
permit the French to order groceries, make train reservations, buy opera 
tickets, monitor news developments, play dozens of video games, hail taxis, 
check schedules, leave messages and even have erotic electronic conversations, 
as well as a dizzying array of other options that multiply nearly every day. 
</P>
<P>
France is also the land of the world's fastest passenger trains, the trains a 
grande vitesse (TGV), that have revolutionized European rail travel and made 
trains competitive with airplanes. The trains are comfortable and remarkably 
smooth, powered by electricity produced from France's 50 nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
Riding the TGV, a businessman can travel from the center of Paris to the center 
of Lyon, a distance of 270 miles, in two hours -- less time than it would take 
him to drive to a Paris airport, hop an airplane and drive into the center of 
Lyon. The high-speed trains have become a major factor in decentralizing 
France. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a significant revival of provincial life," Hoffmann said. 
"Paris is still Paris, but it doesn't pump the rest of France the way it used 
to." 
</P>
<P>
In the fall, the French state railroad company will launch its new Atlantic 
line with trains that travel at more than 180 miles per hour on a route that 
will eventually hook up with Nantes, capital of Brittany. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dream of European Network 
</P>
<P>
In the future, French engineers dream of wrapping all of Western Europe in a 
network of high-speed rail lines that will propel passengers from Paris to 
London, for example, in only three hours by 1993. 
</P>
<P>
In aviation and aerospace, French companies hold 58% interest in the European 
satellite launching consortium Ariane. Ariane, using a rocket that is a 
generation ahead of its American counterparts, recently surpassed its goal of 
capturing more than 50% of the world market. At the beginning of June, Ariane 
had orders to launch 34 satellites, worth nearly $2.5 billion in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
France has also been the major mover behind the European Airbus Industries, 
which has emerged as the major direct competition for the American giant 
Boeing. French engineers developed the "fly by wire" guidance system safe 
enough for commercial aircraft, solving a problem that had eluded American 
engineers for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Mostly because of Airbus, which has orders or commitments for more than 800 
aircraft lasting well into the next century, Toulouse, a charming, 
Spanish-flavored town in southwest France's Garonne Valley, has become the 
undisputed aerospace capital of Europe, populated by one of the world's densest 
concentrations of scientists and engineers. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the impressive technological achievements in this country of 55.6 
million people, the general image of France remains rooted in the past. 
</P>
<P>
A Gallup International poll conducted for the Franco-American Foundation in 
1986 showed that only 30% of Americans considered France "among the leading 
industrial countries in the world." Only 21% of the 1,006 Americans contacted 
for telephone interviews considered France a "serious competitor of the United 
States" in aerospace. Only 20% of the Americans considered France a country 
with "a strong nuclear force of its own." 
</P>
<P>
To many foreigners, particularly Americans, France is a mainly rural land of 
good food, fine perfume and rude waiters. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans still think of France as an agricultural land that knows how to 
produce wine, Camembert cheese and not much else," said Jacques Maisonrouge, 
64, a French engineer who was the first foreigner to sit on the board of 
directors and the top management committee of IBM. He is also the father of 
reluctant parachutist Anne-Sophie. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't know that France is second behind the United States in the 
development of computer software," he continued. "They don't know about our 
airplanes and our medical research. Behind the U.S., France is the 
second-ranked developer of new molecules for drugs." 
</P>
<P>
Entrepreneur Tapie fumed in an animated interview at his Paris headquarters: 
"Americans take us for complete fools. They still imagine us with a baguette of 
bread under our arm, slippers on our feet and Camembert in our string bags." 
</P>
<P>
"The image people have is very old," said Oxford's Zeldin, author of an 
extensive series of books on modern French history and considered, even in 
France, one of the premier foreign interpreters of French life. 
</P>
<P>
"The French feel underestimated, devalued," Zeldin said. "I think it is the 
main reason for the reputation they have for being difficult. They would not be 
so difficult if they felt they were being understood. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest enemies to France," he continued, "are those Francophiles who 
want to keep the French petrified as they were in the 1920s or 1930s, to love 
them as sort of historical monuments. Indeed, the Francophiles resent it if you 
even talk about the future because they feel you are denying that aspect of 
France with which they had grown up, which represented their youth -- and which 
they don't want to change."

HOUSE VOTES TO BAR OFFSHORE DRILLING; 
</P>
<P>
MORATORIUM COVERS CALIFORNIA, MOST OF U.S.; HEADS FOR SENATE SHOWDOWN 
</P>

<P>
The House on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved a measure that would halt 
offshore drilling along much of the American coastline, with the Bush 
Administration bowing to growing anti-drilling sentiment and abandoning an 
effort to block the moratorium on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
The vote set the stage for a Senate showdown on the vast drilling ban, which 
has gained powerful momentum from outrage over the flurry of recent oil spills. 
It is opposed by the Administration on grounds that it would hinder necessary 
oil exploration. 
</P>
<P>
Unprecedented in its scope, the drilling ban would put 84 million acres of the 
nation's outer continental shelf -- including the entire California coast -- 
off limits to oil companies until at least October, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The plan, approved on a 374-49 vote as part of a measure providing $11.1 
billion for the Interior Department, marked a momentous victory for those who 
have counseled caution toward oil exploration in the aftermath of the spills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jeopardizes Watt Plan 
</P>
<P>
The action puts in jeopardy much of the ambitious offshore drilling plan laid 
out by former Interior Secretary James G. Watt nearly nine years ago and 
supported by Republican administrations ever since. It also could render almost 
powerless a White House task force appointed last February by President Bush in 
hopes of restoring a national consensus on the controversial oil exploration 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
The ban, drafted by Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), vastly expands a 
long-standing prohibition on new drilling off Southern and Northern California. 
It adds Central California to the off-limits list for the first time and 
imposes new one-year drilling bans off sensitive areas of the coasts of Alaska, 
Florida and six Mid-Atlantic states. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, it launches Congress' first attempt to roll back the territory 
already claimed by drilling operations, requiring the Interior Department to 
consider buying back a substantial tract of sea floor already leased to the oil 
companies in Alaska's Bristol Bay for more than $95 million. 
</P>
<P>
Although the drilling moratorium surmounted what had been expected to be a 
major hurdle last week when it was easily approved by the House Appropriations 
Committee, the Bush Administration had planned to ambush the effort when it 
reached the full House. 
</P>
<P>
But Administration officials said that they were forced to abandon that effort 
after finding that support from traditional quarters had crumbled under the 
weight of public opinion turned increasingly antagonistic to oil exploration. A 
final blow was dealt by television images of a crippled Exxon Valdez trailing a 
miles-long oil slick in the waters off San Diego Bay on Tuesday night, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the House debate on the moratorium -- a prolonged and contentious 
fight when the issue has been discussed in previous years -- Wednesday bore the 
unmistakable aura of a fait accompli as the Republican congressman leading the 
opposition to the drilling ban yielded much of his time to colleagues 
supportive of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Separate Vote 
</P>
<P>
No attempts were made to delete the drilling ban from the legislation, and no 
separate vote was taken on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The easy victory for the drilling moratorium in the House shifted the locus to 
the Senate, where Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) vowed to lead the campaign for a 
drilling ban over what Administration officials characterized as a long-shot 
effort to halt it. 
</P>
<P>
While the Senate previously has exhibited hostility to anti-oil efforts, an 
aide to Wilson said that the senator believes public sentiment has swung 
against drilling to such a marked extent that the moratorium should win 
decisive approval. 
</P>
<P>
A presidential veto of the drilling ban would be out of the question because of 
the importance of the spending bill to which it is attached, White House 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The specter of oil spills hovered over much of the House discussion Wednesday, 
as proponents of the drilling ban warned of the dangers of undertaking new 
risks in oil exploration while Administration allies touted the demonstrated 
safety of offshore oil. 
</P>
<P>
Panetta, whose bill covers an area 100 times greater than the first moratorium 
he authored in 1981, described the sweeping House action as reflective of 
"growing public concern and anger over the failed promises that oil spills can 
be contained." 
</P>
<P>
But his chief adversary on the issue, Rep. Ralph Regula (R-Ohio), warned that 
the provision would leave the United States ever more dependent on foreign oil 
and "headed down the same road" that led to the devastating gasoline lines and 
energy crises of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
And another powerful advocate of oil interests, Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.) 
adopted the rallying cry of earlier contentious energy fights when he said of 
oil moratorium advocates: "Let 'em freeze in the dark!" 
</P>
<P>
If finally enacted, the moratorium would severely limit the influence of the 
White House task force appointed by Bush to advise him on whether drilling 
should proceed in controversial Lease Sale 91 off Northern California and Lease 
Sale 95 off Southern California, and in another area off Florida's Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
The task force has been instructed to make recommendations to Bush by the end 
of the year. Under the moratorium, however, the department would be unable to 
act until October, 1990, leaving Congress time to challenge any 
Administration-backed drilling plans that it still might find unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium approved by Congress likely would delay any new federal drilling 
activity off California well beyond the autumn of 1990 because it includes 
added protection barring the government from beginning even prelease activity. 
</P>
<P>
That provision most likely would affect Lease Sale 119, a massive tract off 
Central California, where the auction of drilling rights almost certainly would 
be stalled until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The $11.1-billion Interior appropriations bill includes some $220 million more 
than the Administration had requested, largely because of additional spending 
on national parks approved after a procession of 350 congressmen appeared 
before a House committee to request special grants for parks in their areas.

SENATE ACTS TO PROTECT FAMILIES IN AMNESTY PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In an action that could affect more than 1.5 million illegal aliens, the Senate 
voted Wednesday to bar deportation of the immediate family members of persons 
who qualified for amnesty under the 1986 immigration law. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these relatives had "fallen through the cracks" because they did not 
themselves receive protection under the amnesty program and are forever in 
danger of being deported, senators who supported the measure said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'In the Shadows' 
</P>
<P>
"These people should not face such a threat," said Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.). 
"We should tell these people they can stay with their families. They should not 
have to live in the shadows any longer." 
</P>
<P>
The action, taken on a 61-38 vote, addresses one of the strongest criticisms of 
the landmark 1986 immigration law -- that it threatened to tear apart families 
whose members did not all qualify for the same immigration status. Although 
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials have said that they would not 
carry out wholesale deportation of such persons, they have refused to provide 
guarantees, saying that the law does not permit them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
In other action on the bill, the Senate voted to provide at least 216,000 visas 
a year for U.S. citizens' extended family members living in other countries. 
The 62-36 vote appeared to conflict with a central provision of the bill that 
would have established an annual limit of 600,000 immigrants to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The votes came during lengthy debate over legislation aimed at sweeping reform 
of the nation's system of "legal" immigration, the first such change in the 
laws since 1965. The Senate is expected to complete action on the bill later 
this week and the House is scheduled to take up its own version of the 
legislation later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed bill, the United States would significantly increase the 
number of visas to European immigrants. Sponsors said that the current system 
discriminates against such countries, noting that more than 85% of U.S. 
immigrants come from Latin American and Asian nations. 
</P>
<P>
The bill would create a new category of visas designed for people who have 
desirable job skills and education, but who do not have family members living 
here. By contrast, many immigrants from Latin America and Asia come to this 
country because they have relatives living in the United States and wish to 
reunite with their families. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'More Flexible' 
</P>
<P>
"Our whole point in this bill is to be more flexible and open to immigrants 
from nations which are now short-changed by current law," said Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy (D-Mass.), a sponsor of the bill. "By readdressing some of these 
imbalances, we will again open our doors to those who no longer have immediate 
family ties in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
A key part of the legislation would have put an annual cap of 600,000 on the 
number of persons who could immigrate to this nation. Sponsors proposed 
providing 120,000 visas for persons with desirable skills and 480,000 visas to 
the family members of persons already living here. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the measure would increase by 100,000 the number of visas granted last 
year to immigrants. To keep within the 480,000 figure, however, the bill 
provides that the number of visas given to extended family members would 
decrease as the number of visas given to immediate family members increases. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, there is no limit on the number of immediate family members who can 
be granted visas. Last year, 219,340 such persons immigrated to this country 
and the number is expected to rise significantly within the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), a sponsor of the bill, said that the Senate had 
to make "tough choices" and that it was more important to give visas to 
immediate family members -- including parents, spouses and minor children -- 
than to extended family members. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, Simpson said, the legislation was designed to control the number of 
people immigrating to the United States. The question, he said, "is how many 
people does this country take in? Somebody has to deal with that. I don't think 
the American people want unlimited immigration." 
</P>
<P>
But critics said that the numerical restrictions in effect could prevent 
extended family members from coming to the United States. They cited a recent 
General Accounting Office study which estimated that, given current immigration 
trends, all 480,000 "family" visas would be taken up by immediate family 
members sometime in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of provision pits one kind of family member against another," said 
Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), who won passage of an amendment guaranteeing at 
least 216,000 visas annually for extended family members. "That's a very 
profound change in our immigration policy and I don't think anybody wants 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) was more blunt, saying that "the conflict here is 
between a number and a principle. The number 600,000 didn't come from Mt. 
Olympus . . . it was developed by a committee. There shouldn't have to be a 
choice of this kind." 
</P>
<P>
In their vote affecting the amnesty program for illegal aliens, senators 
cautioned that the new protections would be extended only to a select group. To 
qualify, persons would have to be the immediate family members of people who 
qualified for amnesty protections under the 1986 law. In addition, they would 
have had to have been living in this country before Nov. 6, 1986, the effective 
date of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
About 3 million illegal aliens were covered by the amnesty program. An aide to 
Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), said that about 1.5 million family members would 
be affected, based on several recent immigration reports made available to 
senators. 
</P>
<P>
While allowing the relatives to stay in this country, the action would not 
provide full amnesty status for them. Under an amendment sponsored by Chafee, 
they would receive only a stay of deportation and work authorization 
privileges. To gain full citizenship, they would have to apply through the 
regular immigration system.

A man dressed in what was described as a Contra uniform stopped a bus in 
eastern Nicaragua, forced the passengers out and killed six of them with a 
submachine gun, according to government reports. Pro-government newspapers said 
the attack occurred in Camoapa, 54 miles east of Managua. Four more people were 
killed and one man was wounded when the U.S.-backed rebels attacked the village 
of Rancho Grande, in eastern Chontales province, the Voice of Nicaragua 
government radio said. No details on either attack were immediately available. 
Only scattered skirmishes have been reported since March, 1988, when a 
cease-fire was signed by the Contras and Sandinistas.

BISHOPS URGE PRIEST'S RETURN TO CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The nation's 13 black Roman Catholic bishops urged a Washington priest who 
established an independent African-American Catholic congregation to abandon 
his efforts and return to the church. The bishops said they hoped that Father 
George A. Stallings Jr. and his followers "are not commingling personal 
disappointment, individually felt frustrations and personal anger under the 
banner of racism." Racism, they said, "is too serious an issue to be used as a 
cover for selfish concerns." But the controversial priest told the Washington 
Post the bishops had "opted for office and position over their ability to 
exercise a prophetic voice." Earlier this month, Stallings established the 
Imani Temple, saying the Catholic Church had failed to embrace the culture, 
history and spirit of its black members. Church officials have suspended 
Stallings from preaching, celebrating Mass or administering any of the church's 
sacraments, including baptism and Holy Communion.

Afghanistan's envoy to India said Afghanistan is prepared to attack Afghan 
guerrilla bases in neighboring Pakistan unless the rebels stop their rocket 
barrages on Kabul, the capital. Ambassador Abdul Samad Azhar told a New Delhi 
news conference that 65 rockets struck Kabul on Monday, killing 18 civilians 
and injuring 130. "If we have no choice, we will retaliate and we will attack 
the bases in Pakistan," he said. There was no immediate reaction from Pakistan, 
which has brushed off previous warnings.

An Illinois woman pleaded innocent to murder charges in her 6-week-old 
daughter's suffocation death nearly three years after her first baby girl died 
under almost identical circumstances. Circuit Judge Edward Ferguson told Paula 
Sims she could be sentenced to death if convicted of two first-degree murder 
charges in the death of daughter Heather Lee, whose body was found in a trash 
can May 3. Sims, 30, told authorities that masked gunmen abducted Heather and 
13-day-old Loralei Marie, who died in 1986. Sims has already been accused of 
hiding the babies' deaths and lying to investigators.

A new study suggests that eating large amounts of dairy products, especially 
yogurt and cottage cheese, may increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer, 
a researcher said. A team of researchers affiliated with Harvard Medical School 
found for the first time that women with ovarian cancer were more likely to eat 
dairy products, especially yogurt and cottage cheese, compared to healthy 
women. Dr. Daniel Cramer, who headed the study published in the British journal 
The Lancet, stressed the findings need to be confirmed before recommending 
women eat less dairy products. Scientists believe that a sugar found in milk, 
cheese, yogurt and other dairy products known as galactose may damage the 
ovaries.

JURY URGES DEATH PENALTY

Convicted mass murderer David (Moochie) Welch should be sentenced to death for 
the predawn shooting rampage that left six people dead in Oakland's biggest 
mass murder, an Alameda County Superior Court jury recommended. Welch, 31, 
showed no emotion when the jury read the recommendation after deliberating four 
hours over two days. The same jury on June 19 convicted Welch of six counts of 
murder stemming from the bloody Dec. 6, 1986, shooting that left his former 
girlfriend and five others dead. Two of the dead were children, ages 2 and 4. 
Welch had a long-running feud with the woman's family. "I'm relieved for the 
victims' families and for my own that this ordeal has finally come to a rest," 
Welch told Superior Court Judge Stanley Golde after the jury was dismissed. 
Golde set a July 26 sentencing date.

California's shield law does not protect media people from testifying about an 
incident witnessed while covering another story, according to a state appellate 
court decision in a Bakersfield case. Justice Marvin Baxter wrote that the 
shield law was not intended to create an absolute privilege and immunity from 
testifying about happenstance observations of public events. The case involved 
Michael Gregerson, a cameraman for KERO-TV, who was covering a 1986 traffic 
accident in which a load of packaged meat spilled on California 99. As he 
filmed an interview with a California Highway Patrol officer, a car struck the 
debris in the road and flipped over. The driver, John Liggett, was injured, and 
he sued the meat company and subpoenaed Gregerson to testify. Gregerson's 
station provided Liggett a tape of the accident but balked at having Gregerson 
testify, contending that the cameraman was protected under the shield law.

INSURER BACKS MOVE IN CONGRESS FOR U.S. TO PREEMPT REGULATIONS 
</P>

<P>
State Farm, the largest seller of both auto and homeowner insurance in 
California, is supporting action in Congress to preempt enforcement in 
California and all other states of both rate regulation and restrictions on 
pricing auto insurance according to where policyholders live. 
</P>
<P>
Such action for federal preemption of traditional state prerogatives over the 
insurance industry would gut two of the main provisions of California's 
Proposition 103 and sharply reduce regulation in such states as New York, 
Michigan, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, all of which have 
elaborate regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Although company officials said they have been in favor of federal preemption 
for some time, State Farm representatives appearing in numerous public hearings 
of the California Insurance Department since Proposition 103 was passed in 
November have said nothing of such a position. 
</P>
<P>
State Farm's call for federal preemption became clear this week after company 
attorneys were asked to elaborate on general conversations held at company 
headquarters here last week with State Farm Chairman and President Edward B. 
Rust Jr. and Executive Vice President Vincent J. Trosino. Most of the 
clarifications came from State Farm general counsel Pete Ingham, who sat in on 
the original conversations last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Rust and Trosino had talked in general terms of pushing for federal assumption 
of some state responsibilities over auto insurance, and had expressed 
resistance to spreading state regulation, which they asserted would only harm 
consumer as well as company interests. 
</P>
<P>
Ingham this week described in specific terms State Farm's call for the federal 
preemptions, which would reverse a 40-year-old federal policy of leaving 
insurance regulation to the states. He emphasized that State Farm does not want 
the federal government to set rates nationally, that it simply wants the states 
prohibited from setting rates individually. 
</P>
<P>
Provisions in Proposition 103 that have been upheld by the state Supreme Court 
established a comprehensive system of rate regulation in California for the 
first time. The provisions require approval by the insurance commissioner of 
not only auto insurance rates, but the rates of most other lines of property 
and casualty insurance, including homeowner and commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Many other states also regulate rates, including New York, which with a 
combination of no-fault auto insurance and rate regulation is frequently cited 
even by insurers as having a model system. 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 103 also has mandated California's first restrictions on 
neighborhood pricing, known in the industry as the territorial rating system, 
although it is uncertain how the language in the measure will be interpreted 
and applied by the state Insurance Department. 
</P>
<P>
According to Proposition 103, a driver's record, the number of miles driven and 
the years of driving experience are supposed to be more important as rating 
factors than where the driver lives. 
</P>
<P>
If State Farm were to get its way with Congress and the federal government were 
to preempt these areas of insurance law, it would in effect repeal these key 
regulatory provisions adopted last year by the California electorate. 
</P>
<P>
In the conversations here, Trosino in particular expressed the view that 
implementing Proposition 103 would bring about a "monumental change" in State 
Farm's pricing, and company rate programmers who were interviewed said it would 
cost the company millions of dollars and take three to four months just to make 
necessary computer changes. 
</P>
<P>
"Proposition 103 means basing auto insurance on the driver, not the car as is 
presently the case," Trosino said. "We could do it, but there would be many 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gathering of Data 
</P>
<P>
He and Rust said insurers would have to obtain extensive new information on how 
many cars a person drives, how much he drives, how safely he drives and so 
forth. Reliable information would be extremely hard to obtain, they said. They 
suggested that there would be little likelihood that policyholders would like 
the new system any better than the old. 
</P>
<P>
The two executives said that State Farm recently had prepared, at a cost of 
several million dollars, a new pricing plan for its policyholders in Ontario 
Province in Canada, only to be told at the last moment by regulators who had 
ordered the new plan not to implement it. They said the regulators had realized 
that, despite all their efforts and instructions, the plan would mean higher 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
Ingham said State Farm believes that leaving companies free to set whatever 
rates they desire will enhance competition and serve consumer interests best in 
the long run. He said State Farm wants state insurance regulators to be left 
free by the federal government to concentrate on checking insurer solvency and 
market conduct. 
</P>
<P>
These were other highlights of the conversations: 
</P>
<P>
* The officials exhibited little enthusiasm for a suggestion by Allstate 
executives last Wednesday that a new no-fault auto insurance initiative might 
be put on the 1990 ballot if the California Legislature does not act this year 
to mandate such a system. The State Farm executives, however, did not 
completely rule out participating in such a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
* State Farm, Trosino said, has been reluctant to suggest insurance system 
reforms on its own in California "because we don't want to promise anything 
that, two or three years on, we won't be able to deliver." 
</P>
<P>
* Rust said State Farm has never favored compulsory auto insurance laws such as 
California's, and Trosino says the company fully understands why poor people 
faced with a choice between buying food and buying auto insurance would choose 
food. He expressed "sympathy" with the plight of such people under California's 
mandatory insurance law, but asserted that it is not feasible to do anything 
about the neighborhood pricing system under which the urban poor often pay the 
highest rates. 
</P>
<P>
* Competition has forced State Farm to narrow its neighborhood pricing zones in 
California. Originally, the company had only a few such basic pricing 
territories: Los Angeles, San Francisco, the suburbs around them and then the 
rest of the state. Theoretically, the officials said, fewer zones might be more 
desirable. 
</P>
<P>
* Trosino said that the anger among California consumers that resulted in the 
passage of Proposition 103 was, according to industry polls, centered even more 
among middle classes than among the poor.

DYMALLY TOPS STATE'S HOUSE DELEGATION IN TRAVEL, STUDY REVEALS 
</P>

<P>
Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton), who is fast becoming California's most 
well-traveled congressman, made eight separate foreign trips at the expense of 
the U.S. government and six overseas visits financed by special interests or 
foreign governments during the 100th Congress in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Although Dymally had already reported his privately funded trips earlier this 
year, the extent of his government-financed travel did not come to light until 
Wednesday with the publication of a comprehensive study of congressional travel 
by Public Citizen, a nonprofit organization founded by consumer advocate Ralph 
Nader. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Picked Up Tab 
</P>
<P>
The study indicates that taxpayers picked up the tab for a total of 1,053 
congressional trips during the two-year session of the 100th Congress at a cost 
of more than $13.5 million. This included one trip sponsored by the House Rules 
Committee, which has no jurisdiction over foreign or domestic policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
While Dymally's jet-setting clearly outpaced other California congressmen, he 
was by no means the leader in congressional travel funded by the U.S. taxpayer. 
That status went to Rep. Stephen Solarz (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Asian 
and Pacific subcommittee, who made 14 separate trips -- with 39 stops -- paid 
for by the government. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Dymally's government-funded travel exceeded that of most 
congressmen. His itinerary included trips to France and the United Kingdom at a 
cost of $5,425; Zaire, Belgium, Israel, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, $4,741; Japan, 
Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and China, $6,875; Antigua, $1,474; Trinidad, Barbados 
and St. Lucia, $1,383; United Kingdom, Ethiopia, Angola and Portugal, $6,744, 
and Brazil for an undetermined cost. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally is a member of Solarz's subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally's privately funded travel drew attention recently as a result of his 
efforts to persuade the government of Uganda to hire a friend and campaign 
contributor, Mamadi Diane, as an agent for U.S. food aid sent to that country. 
Diane, who heads the Zaire-American Research Institute, accompanied Dymally 
last year on one of his two trips to Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1988, while Dymally was traveling to Zaire, Belgium, Israel, Jordan 
and Saudi Arabia at U.S. government expense, he also made stops in Zambia, 
Gabon, the Ivory Cost, Angola and Ghana at the expense of the governments of 
Zaire and the Ivory Coast and a group known as the Coalition for a Free Africa. 
</P>
<P>
Dymally also traveled to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the Middle East at 
the expense of the Arab American Institute, to Brazil at the expense of the 
Coalition for a Free Africa, to Puerto Rico at the expense of the private 
Mendez Foundation, to Tokyo and Seoul at the expense of Soka University, to 
Saudi Arabia at the expense of the International Friendship Assn. and from 
Nice, France, to Brussels to Zaire at the expense of the government of Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
Other well-traveled Californians included recently retired Rep. Robert Badham, 
who took seven U.S.-funded overseas trips; Rep. George E. Brown (D-Colton), who 
took six, and Reps. Robert Dornan (R-Garden Grove) and Howard Berman 
(D-Panorama City), each of whom took five foreign trips financed by the 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Another Californian, Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), took part in one of the 
most expensive government-paid trips during the 100th Congress, at least on the 
basis of cost per person. Miller was one of several House members who took an 
eight-day trip to Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong in November, 1988, at a cost of 
$21,315 each. 
</P>
<P>
It is not always clear from available public records which government-funded 
trips by members of Congress were made for legislative research and which trips 
had no legislative purpose. But Public Citizen singled out the House Rules 
Committee's 12-day trip to Spain, Malta, Turkey, Kenya and Senegal as the most 
obvious "junket." 
</P>
<P>
The Rules Committee listed as the objective of its trip "to acquaint members 
with various international issues as they relate to the foreign policy of the 
United States and to geopolitical issues which will affect international 
relations." Among other stops, the group listed a meeting with the Malta 
parliamentary secretary for the elderly at the U.N. International Institute for 
the Aging. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mark Centennial 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, 12 congressmen and seven staff members went on a seven-day trip to 
Australia in August, 1988, to help celebrate the centennial of the Australian 
Parliament. The total reported cost for the trip was $188,266. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress sometimes underestimate the full cost of their trips when 
they submit the final report to be printed in the Congressional Record, 
according to Public Citizen. 
</P>
<P>
In July, 1988, for example, two congressmen and two staffers made a trip to the 
Philippines, Korea and Japan that they reported as costing $21,197. But U.S. 
Army documents for the same trip list the total cost of military aircraft used 
at $101,926. 
</P>
<P>
Although some congressmen travel overseas on commercial airlines, most of them 
prefer to go by military transport. The Air Force's 89th Military Airlift Wing 
has been been set aside for ferrying members of Congress and other high-ranking 
officials around the world. The wing has more than 1,400 personnel and 45 
aircraft, but its annual budget is not public. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Congress are permitted to take spouses along on the trips as long as 
it creates no additional expense to the government. In practice, spouses 
usually travel free, occupying empty seats on military aircraft chartered for 
members.

COURT BLOCKS STATE-FUNDED ABORTION CURBS 
</P>

<P>
A state Court of Appeal on Wednesday blocked new legislative restrictions on 
state-funded abortions for low-income women, ordering such payments to continue 
while it considers a constitutional challenge to the limitations. 
</P>
<P>
The court also barred state authorities from sending notices of the impending 
restrictions to recipients of Medi-Cal assistance, the program under which the 
abortions are obtained. Those notices had been set to go out Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The suit challenging the funding limitation marks the first test of abortion 
rights in California since a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last week gave states 
more leeway to restrict abortion. 
</P>
<P>
In an order signed by Presiding Appellate Justice J. Anthony Kline, the panel 
instructed officials to "continue to perform all ministerial duties" in 
providing funds for abortions, pending a further ruling in a suit filed Tuesday 
by civil rights and women's groups. 
</P>
<P>
The panel gave attorneys for the state Department of Health Services and other 
defendants until July 31 to file briefs responding to the rights groups' 
challenge to abortion curbs. The funding limitation was included in the 1989-90 
Budget Act signed last week by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Provisions 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions permit state-funded abortions only when the mother's life is 
in danger, a pregnancy has resulted from rape or incest, the unborn child is 
severely deformed or an unmarried minor has notified a parent. The state courts 
have struck down similar limitations for the last 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
If implemented, the new restrictions would deny state funding for about 90% of 
the 80,000 abortions that have been performed annually under the Medi-Cal 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The suit, filed by lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union and other 
groups, claims the restrictions violate the right to privacy and other 
provisions of the state Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
While the federal high court's ruling last week did not change California law, 
attorneys for state officials in the suit say they plan to cite the decision in 
defending the Legislature's right to impose the funding restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
The suit is expected to reach the state Supreme Court later this year. The 
court ruled in 1981 that under the California Constitution, the state could not 
deny funds for abortion while paying for childbirth services. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, however, conservatives have replaced liberals as a majority on the 
court, and anti-abortion leaders have expressed hope that the newly aligned 
court may decide to reconsider the 1981 ruling.

HOUSE PANEL VOTES TO CUT ALL FUNDS FOR SCANDAL-PLAGUED HUD PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Reacting to scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, a key 
House appropriations subcommittee has voted to eliminate all funds on Oct. 1 
for a controversial low-income rent subsidy program, it was disclosed 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The panel "zeroed out" money for the troubled Section 8 moderate rehabilitation 
program, which got $323 million in federal funding for the current fiscal year. 
The cut was voted Tuesday despite Housing Secretary Jack Kemp's attempt to 
revise the program to eliminate influence peddling to obtain the grants. 
</P>
<P>
But testimony before congressional committees in recent weeks has dramatized 
how such well-known Republicans as former Interior Secretary James G. Watt and 
a half-dozen former HUD officials have cashed in on political connections as 
consultants to benefit from a program intended to help poor people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Housing Construction 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee in charge of housing appropriations also decided to use some 
of the money that otherwise would go to the moderate rehabilitation, or "Mod 
Rehab," program to authorize construction of 7,500 public housing units in the 
next fiscal year -- an increase of 2,500 from the current figure. 
</P>
<P>
In another move to block favoritism in HUD awards, the subcommittee adopted a 
requirement that all deputy assistant secretaries at the agency be career civil 
servants and not political appointees. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp was told of the developments as he testified Wednesday before the housing 
subcommittee of the Housing, Banking and Urban Affairs Committee. He objected 
to the reduction in the number of political appointees but told the panel that 
he had taken a separate step toward limiting the power of political appointees 
once they leave office. 
</P>
<P>
More specifically, he said that he had asked the Office of Government Ethics to 
bar all top-level HUD employees from lobbying his department for at least a 
year after they leave their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp reacted calmly to the elimination of subsidy funds for the Mod Rehab 
program. However, he objected strongly to the subcommittee's action requiring 
career employees in the deputy assistant secretary posts. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration did not ask for any funds for Mod Rehab, which was 
manipulated by HUD officials in the Ronald Reagan Administration, according to 
congressional testimony. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), chairman of the housing subcommittee, told 
Kemp at Wednesday's hearing of the appropriations panel's decision to chop all 
funds for the Mod Rehab program and the civil service requirement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'News to All of Us' 
</P>
<P>
"It's news to all of us," Kemp said. "I would be terribly disappointed if 
deputy assistant secretaries at HUD were required to be career positions. . . . 
It would limit what the (HUD) secretary could do. . . . It's a pernicious 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Marge Roukema (R-N.J) asked for Kemp's reaction to zero funding for the 
rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't in the budget request that came from HUD," Kemp replied. "We thought 
we could negotiate a better program with the Congress." 
</P>
<P>
While Kemp has said that he did not want to use the recent scandals as a 
subterfuge to eliminate housing programs intended for the poor, he has 
criticized the Mod Rehab program on grounds that it was too costly and gave 
excessive profits to developers. 
</P>
<P>
If the appropriations subcommittee's decision is upheld in the full committee 
and in the House itself, HUD would be able to carry over funds from the current 
fiscal year that were not spent before it ends on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp canceled applications under the program and ordered new applications by 
public housing agencies in cities and states to be selected under a new formula 
designed to eliminate any possibility of political favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
In a June 2 announcement, however, he said that the program was "back on track" 
with awards to be made before Sept. 30, using the new criteria. While Kemp said 
that there was still about $225 million left to spend, a spokesman for the 
House appropriations subcommittee that deals with HUD's budget said the amount 
is only $170 million. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp's steps on lobbying by former officials of the department might help 
bolster confidence in HUD. 
</P>
<P>
Departing from the practice of his much-criticized predecessor, Samuel R. 
Pierce Jr., Kemp proposed to add 54 key political and career positions to the 
list of those subject to the post-employment curbs. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, these 54 posts were exempted by Pierce from rules that forbid 
senior officials from lobbying HUD for one year on any matter and for two years 
on any matter that they were substantially and personally involved in deciding. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional testimony has shown that many top officials left HUD and became 
consultants on housing issues, lobbying their former colleagues for favorable 
decisions on multimillion-dollar grants. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Kemp called it important to expand coverage of the lobbying 
restrictions "if we are to make it clear to the American public that the 
revolving door at HUD has been closed."

MENEM ASSAILS 'SAVAGE' ARGENTINE PRICE BOOSTS

<P>
The new Argentine government warned Wednesday that constant price increases, in 
defiance of government orders, threaten to incite a fresh wave of violence and 
frustrate attempts to rein in hyper-inflation. 
</P>
<P>
President Carlos Saul Menem, who was sworn in Saturday and imposed a fierce 
austerity program the following day, complained publicly in four addresses that 
businessmen are continuing "savage" price increases. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to describe them as immoral," Menem said in one jawboning speech, 
but "it seems that there are Argentines who do not understand the magnitude of 
the crisis and who worry more about their own interests than those of the whole 
society." 
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Eduardo Bauza, who is in charge of security, said there is a 
"latent danger" of new disturbances because of the hunger and impoverishment 
caused by the hyper-inflation of recent months. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, a 19-year-old man was shot to death by a store owner during the 
looting of a market in Tucuman in northwestern Argentina. Isolated cases of 
looting were reported in three cities, although nothing like the outbreak of 
violence over several days in late May in which hundreds of shops were looted, 
15 people were killed and 2,000 arrested. 
</P>
<P>
That unrest helped persuade lame-duck President Raul Alfonsin to step down, 
letting Menem take office five months early to launch his program based on 
cooperation among business, labor and government to cure the diseased economy. 
</P>
<P>
Union leaders, meanwhile, complained that company owners were using the 
economic crisis as a pretext to lay off thousands of workers and many union 
activists, the majority of them from Menem's Justicialist, or Peronist, party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ordered to Roll Back Prices 
</P>
<P>
Although the government told businesses Sunday to roll back prices to July 3 
levels, many apparently ignored the order pending a formal agreement between 
the government and chambers of commerce and industry. Those talks have 
continued without an accord, and some firms have pushed up prices to give 
themselves a cushion in anticipation of an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Civilian Argentine governments historically have been unable to enforce price 
controls without the backing of leading industries. Workers' buying power, 
meanwhile, has been crippled by inflation that hit 114% for June alone. 
</P>
<P>
Bauza said that "the root of the problem is that Argentina is without work, the 
factories are closed and we have been in government for just three days." 
</P>
<P>
He said the government is attempting to balance its austerity measures with a 
socioeconomic program that would alleviate the impact on the most needy and 
that those with means would have to bear a greater burden. 
</P>
<P>
Menem appealed to business leaders to "limit their appetites" and said that the 
price boosts "cause me profound sadness." Such increases, he said, "do not fit 
with the reality, nor with moral and good customs, nor with the 9 million 
Argentines who live on the edge of survival." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Food Prices Shot Up 
</P>
<P>
Fruits and vegetables, which had resisted price increases in recent weeks, shot 
up by 50% on Tuesday, while fish and some toiletries and cleaning products rose 
by 75%. One kilogram (2.2 pounds) of steak, once taken for granted as a staple 
in beef-rich Argentina, sold for the equivalent of $2. In comparison, the 
minimum wage is now worth about $43 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Taxi fares were raised 245%, pushing the flag drop from 44 to 152 australs. 
After the 53% devaluation of the currency, the austral is now worth just 23 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
But the slicing of the austral against the dollar encouraged exporters to cash 
in millions of dollars for australs, boosting the Central Bank's scant 
reserves. Interest rates also plummeted from more than 100% a month to less 
than 10% Wednesday, considered a key step in reducing inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The sevenfold increase in gasoline prices Monday led commuters to switch to 
trains and buses, and the normally horrific traffic thinned to Sunday-style 
serenity. 
</P>
<P>
Menem, an amateur race car driver, said he will use his own car rather than an 
official car to save the government money and will pay for his own gasoline, as 
a gesture of austerity.

CASTRO SEEKS TALKS WITH U.S. TO JOIN 'COMMON BATTLE' ON DRUG SMUGGLING

Cuban President Fidel Castro has asked for talks with the United States to help 
combat drug smuggling, but the State Department said Wednesday it is too early 
to assess the overture. 
</P>
<P>
In a speech broadcast Tuesday on Cuban television, Castro said: "We have to 
arrange a form of communication between the United States and Cuba in this 
common battle. The United States knows that they (the drug smugglers) simply 
laugh when ordered to land. We really have to discuss how to manage such 
things." 
</P>
<P>
Washington has previously said that aircraft and seagoing vessels have eluded 
U.S. agents by entering Cuba's territorial waters or airspace. The island 
nation sits in the middle of some of the primary drug routes into the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
Castro said illegal overflight of Cuban territory "is intolerable and we cannot 
allow them (drug dealers) to make a mockery of our airspace." 
</P>
<P>
"We have never fired at a plane because it could be a drug trafficker, or it 
could be a journalist or a U.S. senator who has gone astray or it could be a 
private individual who refuses to obey the order to land in what U.S. 
propaganda has painted as hell," he added. 
</P>
<P>
While not responding directly to Castro's proposal for talks, State Department 
spokesman Richard Boucher said Wednesday that Washington is "monitoring Cuba's 
narcotics interdiction efforts carefully. But it's too early to assess the 
impact of developments in Cuba on our narcotics policy."

'EXPLAIN TRUTH' OF EVENTS, CHINA TELLS ITS ENVOYS

China's premier and Communist Party chief urged their top diplomats Wednesday 
to do a better job of "explaining the truth" in presenting the official version 
of its suppression of unarmed pro-democracy demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
State-run media also highlighted visits by foreigners in a propaganda campaign 
to show that diplomatic relations have not suffered from international 
condemnation of the June 3-4 military crackdown in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, newly appointed general secretary of the Communist Party, told 151 
ambassadors and senior diplomats they must "help foreign friends get rid of 
their misunderstandings" of recent events in China. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Work to 'Counter Rumors' 
</P>
<P>
Jiang, speaking at the end of a six-day meeting of ambassadors and other senior 
diplomats, said the envoys must "increase their work in explaining the truth to 
counter rumors of Western reports." 
</P>
<P>
The United States and other Western countries have suspended high-level 
government contacts and imposed other sanctions to protest the attack. 
</P>
<P>
China contends that the use of force was necessary to put down what it says was 
a "counterrevolutionary rebellion" to overthrow the government. 
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng told the diplomats that overseas Chinese students who 
participated in protest rallies will be welcomed back to China and won't be 
punished. 
</P>
<P>
"Because they were far from the motherland and influenced by the Western media, 
they didn't understand the true situation and participated in protests and said 
some extremist words," state-run TV quoted Li as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said China has lost at least $60 million in tourist revenue in 
Beijing because of turmoil in the city. China opened an international 
conference Wednesday to seek ways to lure foreign visitors back to such 
attractions as the Great Wall and the Forbidden City.

Washington will not pressure the Israeli Labor Party to remain in its fragile 
coalition government with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir despite an internal 
dispute over elections in the occupied territories, a U.S. official said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"No, that is something that the parties in Israel have to decide for 
themselves," John Kelly, assistant secretary of state for the Middle East, told 
a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leader Shimon Peres this week urged the party to withdraw from the 
coalition government with Shamir's Likud Party because of its new, hard-line 
conditions for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
The New York Times and the Washington Post reported Wednesday that Washington 
is urging Labor to remain in the coalition. At the State Department, spokesman 
Richard Boucher called the reports "patently absurd."

ISRAEL PREPARES TO REOPEN SCHOOLS IN WEST BANK

<P>
Israel ordered preparations Wednesday for the gradual reopening of schools in 
the occupied West Bank, closed for most of the 19-month-old Palestinian 
uprising. 
</P>
<P>
The move follows mounting international pressure, notably from the United 
States, for Israel to relax its clampdown on the occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin set no date for returning the 320,000 Arab 
pupils to their schools, closed because of chronic unrest. 
</P>
<P>
The order appeared to reverse previous government demands for guarantees from 
Palestinian leaders to maintain order in schools and prevent pupils from 
joining demonstrations before any reopening. 
</P>
<P>
Rabin issued his order a week before a U.S. government delegation visits 
Jerusalem to test the sincerity of Israel's offer to hold Palestinian elections 
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has repeatedly urged Israel to reopen schools as a 
confidence-building measure. 
</P>
<P>
Israel first shut them in February, 1988, two months after the uprising 
erupted. The closure affected classes from kindergartens to high schools. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, President Chaim Herzog warned Wednesday that Israel 
faces a threat of anarchy from Jews avenging Palestinian attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Israelis have taken to the streets, hurling stones at Arab motorists 
to retaliate for the killing of 14 Jewish bus passengers last week in the most 
deadly Palestinian attack in more than 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a swearing-in ceremony for new judges, Herzog said: "Anyone who 
believes he has a right to take the place of the rule of law endangers the very 
essence of our society, because if it is permissible for one, it is permissible 
for all, and the result will be anarchy and chaos." 
</P>
<P>
In the occupied West Bank, meanwhile, Palestinians shot and wounded an Arab 
woman suspected of aiding Israeli authorities and severely beat her husband, a 
hospital official said. 
</P>
<P>
During clashes in the Gaza Strip, Israeli troops shot and wounded five 
Palestinians, including a 6-year-old child, hospital officials said.

"The 1988 drought never really ended, although we had some relief until just a 
few weeks ago," Lt. Gov. Lloyd Omdahl said. He announced the disaster 
declaration for Gov. George Sinner, who was out of the state.

"Congress is currently debating a 1989 drought relief package, so we want to

Two security policemen at Hill Air Force Base pleaded innocent Wednesday to

Roth and Danny Stroud were arrested Monday by FBI agents in the July 3 theft of

BILL TO KEEP GUNS FROM CHILDREN SIGNED IN FLORIDA

Gov. Bob Martinez on Wednesday signed legislation requiring gun owners to keep 
weapons out of the reach of children. 
</P>
<P>
The signing occurred a day after a Florida child had wounded himself in the 
finger in the sixth shooting since June 1 of the type that the law is designed 
to prevent. 
</P>
<P>
"This will assist in protecting our children throughout the state," Martinez 
said. "The added public awareness will prompt adults to keep guns out of 
reach." 
</P>
<P>
The law, effective Oct. 1, requires gun owners to keep loaded weapons under 
lock and out of the hands of children age 15 and younger. It also authorizes 
the development of a gun safety program in Florida schools. 
</P>
<P>
If a child shoots himself or someone else because of a gun left within reach, 
the adult could be charged with a felony, punishable by up to five years in 
prison and a $5,000 fine. A gun owner faces a misdemeanor charge and up to 60 
days in jail and a $500 fine if a minor threatens someone with the gun or 
displays it in public. 
</P>
<P>
There are exceptions for hunting and target-shooting accidents and those 
involving stolen guns. 
</P>
<P>
Three children died and two were wounded in the earlier shootings.

Trucks have begun hauling sodium bicarbonate from a San Bernardino neighborhood 
where 15,000 cubic yards of the sand-like material spilled from a runaway 
train. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Pacific spokesman Jim Loveland said the railroad obtained a permit 
from the State Lands Commission to dump the sodium bicarbonate in the dry bed 
of Owens Lake in Inyo County. 
</P>
<P>
It will take 20 days and cost $500,000 to relocate the material, which 
originally was mined from Owens Lake.

Health Problems

<P>
Some San Bernardino residents, complaining of health problems, have pressed the 
railroad to move the sodium bicarbonate, which spilled from a freight train 
that derailed and killed four people May 12. 
</P>
<P>
But Inyo County environmentalists have fought the effort, saying the railroad 
should first have been required to complete an environmental impact report.

GENETICALLY ENGINEERED PROTEIN SPEEDS WOUND HEALING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Minute quantities of a genetically engineered protein can accelerate the 
healing of human wounds, according to a study of 12 patients reported in 
today's New England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
The preliminary findings by a team of researchers led by Dr. Gregory L. Brown 
of the University of Louisville may lead to improved treatments for patients 
with severe burns and chronic wounds, such as bedsores and foot ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
The report, the first of its kind in humans, "is a historical event," said Dr. 
Thomas K. Hunt of UC San Francisco, the co-author of an editorial published in 
the medical journal along with the study. 
</P>
<P>
"Wound healing has been one of the last frontiers for medicine to try to 
influence," Hunt said in an interview. "These people have not (hastened wound 
healing) by a huge margin, but they have done it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Faster Healing 
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that areas of wounded skin treated with the protein 
healed an average of 1 1/2 days faster than comparable areas that were not 
treated with the substance. Previously, they and others had obtained similar 
results in animal studies. 
</P>
<P>
But the researchers have yet to demonstrate that the use of the experimental 
growth factor has important clinical effects in humans, such as the ability to 
prevent wound infections, decrease pain or shorten hospital stays. Larger 
studies seeking to show such benefits are in progress, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The protein is known as human epidermal growth factor (epidermis is a medical 
term for the outer layers of the skin). It is one of a group of proteins that 
play a key role in regulating cell and organ development in animals and humans. 
In 1986, Stanley Cohen, a biochemist, and Rita Levi-Montalcini, a 
neurobiologist, were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for the discovery of 
growth factors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Genetic Engineering 
</P>
<P>
Epidermal growth factor is normally produced by the body. It is already present 
in many injured areas of skin. Scientists have reasoned that they might hasten 
the healing process by applying creams containing additional growth factor to 
wounds and burns. The protein is produced in the laboratory using genetic 
engineering techniques. 
</P>
<P>
The new study involved 12 patients who required skin grafts for various 
reasons, primarily for treatment of burns. To perform such grafts, surgeons 
often cover areas where skin had been lost with a partial thickness of healthy 
skin taken from "donor sites" on the patient's own body. The removal of the 
healthy skin, in effect, creates a wound. 
</P>
<P>
For each patient in the study, two paired donor sites were selected. After the 
skin for grafting was removed, one donor site was treated with a cream commonly 
used to prevent infections. The other site was treated with a preparation of 
the cream that contained epidermal growth factor. Neither the researchers nor 
the patients knew which donor site received the growth factor treatments. 
</P>
<P>
The creams were applied every 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that treatment with epidermal growth factor 
"significantly decreased the average length of time" to achieve total wound 
healing by about 1 1/2 days. Accelerated healing was seen in all patients; 
typically, the wounds took one to two weeks to heal entirely. 
</P>
<P>
After a minimum of one year of follow-up, the researchers said there had been 
no complications, such as abnormal scars or early evidence of skin tumors. 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the study was important because it showed "efficacy in man," not 
because physicians would necessarily use the growth factor exactly as it was 
used in the study. The growth factor might prove most valuable for 
"problematic, non-healing wounds," he said. These include bedsores, diabetic 
skin ulcers and venous skin ulcers of the lower legs, as well as extensive 
burns, where skin grafts must be repeatedly harvested from non-burned areas of 
the body. Patients with extensive burns often spend months in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
In their New England Journal editorial, Hunt and Dr. Frederick B. La Van, also 
of UCSF, sounded a cautionary note. "Critics will no doubt note that the 
practical results of this study are trivial," they wrote. The editorial pointed 
out that other researchers had used similar experiments to demonstrate 
"equivalent accelerations" in the rate of wound healing with the use of oxygen, 
electromagnetic waves, and Preparation H, an over-the-counter hemorrhoidal 
remedy that contains a "live yeast cell derivative." 
</P>
<P>
But Hunt and La Van said that the new study advanced upon these earlier 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
They added: "The annual market for products used in the care of wounds in this 
country is more than $1 billion, and a successful growth factor-based product 
would be expected to capture a substantial share of the market." 
</P>
<P>
The epidermal growth factor research was conducted at the University of 
Louisville, Vanderbilt University in Nashville and Emory University in Atlanta. 
The growth factor was manufactured by Chiron Corp., of Emeryville, Calif., one 
of a number of biotechnology firms that are seeking to develop growth 
factor-based medications.

THE BRIDE WORE ANYTHING BUT WHITE IN A DRESS BY SUSAN LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE SEIPP, Seipp is a Beverly Hills free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After Carol Ramey and her boyfriend made plans to marry on their houseboat, she 
realized that she didn't want to wear a traditional white wedding dress. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little older than the average bride," said Ramey, who is 40 and getting 
married for the second time. "I wanted something unique." 
</P>
<P>
She spotted a photo of an elegant dress in a bridal magazine and sought out the 
designer, Susan Lane. When she finally walked in the door of Lane's Toluca Lake 
boutique, Country Elegance, Ramey said she felt that she had "died and gone to 
heaven." 
</P>
<P>
"This dress is perfect, exactly what I wanted," Ramey said of her $450 
purchase. "It's a blush chiffon with an intermission hemline. It has a V-neck, 
bellman sleeves, satin rosettes in front and the bodice is cotton. The dress is 
floor-length and rises up about eight inches in front." 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to designing bridal attire, 50-year-old Lane has always had a 
flair for the slightly off-beat. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Romantic Valentines' 
</P>
<P>
"You see, a lot of people don't look good in white," Lane said. "Anybody with 
pale skin, for instance, usually looks much better in a dress with color. We 
work with lots of color, but I like to think of them as valentines . . . 
romantic valentines. The majority of the colors we work with, such as blush, 
are so muted you don't even notice that it's color -- you just notice its 
warmth." (When Lane recently remarried for the fourth time, she wore a silver 
silk Charmeuse dress with an intermission hemline, hand-painted flowers and 
beadwork on the bodice and a plunging neckline.) 
</P>
<P>
Lane's million-dollar business ("once I passed a million dollars, which was in 
1984, I stopped giving figures," she said) happened almost by accident. 
</P>
<P>
An art major, "home sewer" and housewife in the 1960s, Lane started "laying out 
patchwork skirts on my pool table. I hate to throw things away. I think the 
first skirt I did I used pink burlap and yellow. . . . I used to wear it all 
the time to entertain, and people would just go crazy." 
</P>
<P>
After selling one of the patchwork skirts in a friend's store, Lane sewed two 
more, graduated to mass production and then, 20 years ago, opened her own shop 
in Studio City. (She moved the store to Toluca Lake in 1982.) "Now we've even 
gone into manufacturing. We have a 10,000-square-foot factory in Sherman Oaks," 
said Lane, who lives in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The designer makes most of her elegant, romantic dresses, which range in price 
from $350 to $500, in such fabrics as lace, chiffon, satin and satinet. 
"Satinet comes in so many great colors that drapes really nicely," Lane said. 
"Some people want silk, but satinet is soft. If I were to show you a dress in 
silk and you were to feel it, you could not tell the difference between that 
and satinet." 
</P>
<P>
Lane's philosophy of design does not begin and end with her dress line. Country 
Elegance is full of wedding touches: wicker baskets full of silk roses are 
casually strewn on the blond wood floor. Sepia-toned, turn-of-the-century 
brides and grooms stare sweetly from photos hanging on the walls. Antique 
gowns, oak dressers, hat boxes and a peach satin sofa complete the look -- in 
addition to a little, lace-covered table that offers wine and pretzels. 
</P>
<P>
"The men love those," Lane said, laughing. "It's just a real nice touch, 
especially when the men come in, because they don't have anything to do . . . 
and they can sit down, have a glass of wine -- and more and more, we're getting 
men in here. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first started business, you'd never get a man in here," she added. "You 
had everybody wanting white, and the brides were 18. Now they're 30; the men 
come with them. They help them pay for the dress and the brides choose dresses 
with some color in them. It's been a gradual trend." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Krylon Gown 
</P>
<P>
Another trend in wedding gear that Lane has fueled is the paper gown, a $140 
dress that is actually made of Krylon, an interfacing. "You wear it once, then 
throw it away, since a lot of people only wear their wedding dress once 
anyway," Lane said. "Or you can have the guests sign the train and use the 
train for a guest book. Also, if you don't like the hem length, you can just 
snip it shorter." 
</P>
<P>
Jamie Nehen, a 23-year-old secretary from Encino, opted for a pink lace gown 
over a satin slip for a garden wedding. "I wanted something cool and 
comfortable, plus I thought traditional just wouldn't fit. We're having a 
country-style wedding. And pink is my favorite color," said Nehen, who paid 
$500 for her dress. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally a bride picks something bold and bright. "About three years ago," 
Lane said, "a bride planned to get married on Christmas Eve and we made her a 
red wedding dress. Thinking of the Christmas theme, we also made her bouquets 
of soft green ferns." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the bride wears black. "One gal called us and said, 'Black is my 
signature; I always wear black.' We tried several things on her and, sure 
enough, she looked best in black. So I figured, 'Well, if you're going to do 
it, do something very romantic, very 1920s.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Art Deco-Looking' 
</P>
<P>
Or sometimes the bride wears white -- and the bridesmaids wear black. "Now 10 
years ago, that would have been shocking," Lane said. "But it's very Art 
Deco-looking. It's very sophisticated." (Thinking beyond the wedding day, Lane 
carries two-piece outfits that can be worn elsewhere. "I really want to work 
with the girls so they can wear their dress again -- bridesmaids too," said 
Lane, whose bridesmaids' outfits average about $165.) 
</P>
<P>
"We do custom dresses for people who might have figure problems," Lane said. 
"We choose a fabric, and come in and we might match the top with the bottom, 
where, let's say, they have heavy hips." 
</P>
<P>
Helping out in the custom area is Sigrid Bailly, who tends to nervous brides in 
a small room styled after a shingled, Victorian house. Sigrid's one-of-a-kind 
Heirloom Collection dresses range from $400 to $1,300. 
</P>
<P>
Lane also specializes in particuar looks, such as the 1940s bride, the 
Victorian bride and the 1950s bride. "What we're saying, and it's really true, 
is the brides of the '90s can wear all those different styles," Lane said.

CITY MANAGER WINS AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Manager Edward S. Kreins was awarded the Burton E. Green Public Service 
Award at a policeman's black tie ball. 
</P>
<P>
Kreins, city manager for 10 years and police chief for four years before that, 
was the first recipient of the award, which is named after the oil man who 
struck it rich by developing Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
It is designed to honor city executives and managers "whose career best 
exemplifies dedication to public service and whose character embodies the 
spirit and courage associated with the name of Burton E. Green," a city 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
A separate cash award of $1,000 is to be announced later in the year for a 
graduate of Beverly Hills High School who is interested in a career in public 
service. 
</P>
<P>
The award is funded by a grant from the Burton E. Green Foundation, which was 
set up by Green and his wife in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Green and two partners formed the Rodeo &amp; Water Co. in 1906 to exploit the 
land they originally bought in the hope of striking oil. 
</P>
<P>
They called it Beverly Hills after Green read in a newspaper that 
then-president William Howard Taft had vacationed in Beverly Farms, Mass.

COUNCIL OKS 12% HOTEL TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has approved a 2% increase in the city's hotel occupancy tax, 
which is expected to generate an additional $897,000 per year when it takes 
effect Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
The council gave final approval for the hike in a 6-1 vote Tuesday. It is 
designed to take advantage of a hotel construction boom that will increase the 
number of rooms in Santa Monica by 80%, to 1,800, by next year. Councilman Herb 
Katz voted against the measure, objecting to the city encouraging tourism and 
hotel growth and then heavily taxing the industry. 
</P>
<P>
Local hoteliers and the city's Convention and Visitors Bureau have complained 
that the boost was unnecessary, that hoteliers were carrying an unfair burden 
of the cost for growth and that they were not adequately consulted by the city. 
But none were on hand for Tuesday's meeting or a previous public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John Jalili said a city consultant predicted that the measure, 
which raises the tax on nightly room rentals from 10% to 12%, will have 
negligible impact on business and is equivalent to rates in surrounding 
municipalities. The money generated will go into the city's general budget. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, annual income from the hotel tax has nearly quadrupled to $4.5 
million through rising occupancy alone, without an increase in taxes.

2 ARTS PANELS WILL MERGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monica approved consolidation of its Arts Commission and Arts Foundation, 
arguing that the two boards' roles of public art direction and private fund 
raising should be unified to reduce overlap and public confusion between the 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
The move, approved on a 7-0 vote by the City Council, directs the city attorney 
to revise city ordinances to complete the merger. 
</P>
<P>
When the city created the groups in 1982-83, the commission was directed to 
give legal and administrative structure for public art programs while the 
foundation solicited private funding support. Recently, however, the two 
groups' operations converged, and foundation members complained that they had 
no say over how the funds they raised were spent. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, both boards' members will sit on a panel that functions 
alternately as a government policy agency and a nonprofit fund-raising group.

CHILD ABUSE EFFORT FUNDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Pasadena-based program that strives to keep abused children with their 
parents rather than placing them in foster homes will continue to operate for 
another year, thanks to additional funding included in the 1989-90 budget and 
approved by Gov. Deukmejian last week. 
</P>
<P>
Hillsides Home for Children is one of eight nonprofit agencies in California 
that will receive a total of $1.2 million during fiscal 1989-90 to hire 
professional therapists to make regular visits to the homes of abused children. 
The pilot programs were started in 1984, and preliminary reports show they are 
75% successful in keeping families together. 
</P>
<P>
Hillsides' In-Home Critical Care program treats 100 San Gabriel Valley families 
each year. Its staff includes four full-time therapists, one part-time social 
worker and one full-time project director. The program operates on a $200,000 
annual budget, 75% of which is provided by the state. 
</P>
<P>
"We were delighted because if the governor did not extend the projects they 
would have died out," said Steve Madison, president of the board of directors 
of the California Consortium of Child Abuse Councils, which lobbied the 
governor in support of the programs. 
</P>
<P>
Madison said his organization hopes that the programs will be made permanent 
through legislation.

FREEDOM IS OBTAINABLE, BUT THE PRICE IS HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Defending the right of immigrants to settle in the San Gabriel Valley, Barkley 
Lee wrote in a letter to the editor (Times, June 22): "Wouldn't most people in 
the world want to live in a free country?" saying we should "embrace everyone 
into the American mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
Lee is wrong for assuming that freedom can only be found in America. Democracy 
is not a rare plant that can only grow in the U.S.A.; it could grow in China, 
but freedom is not free. It is a tree whose roots must be nurtured by the blood 
of patriots. 
</P>
<P>
Americans died during our War of Independence with England, but other patriots 
didn't give up, and we won our independence. 
</P>
<P>
Why do Chinese patriots give up so easily? 
</P>
<P>
England faced certain defeat by the Nazis in the Battle of Britain, but, 
refusing to give up, Winston Churchill spoke for all patriots, no matter what 
their country, when he said that even if the Nazis won, "We will fight in the 
streets. We will fight in the hills; we shall never give up." 
</P>
<P>
England lost some battles, but won the war. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese patriots should follow his advice. If they want democracy, they should 
stay in China and fight for it. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing, not even tanks and machine guns, are as effective in war as an idea 
whose time has come. If it is time for democracy in China -- I think it is -- 
then now's the time for the Chinese people to take it -- if that is what they 
really want.

CONSERVANCY FUNDS VETOED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed from the state's 1989-90 budget a $3-million 
appropriation for the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to acquire land near 
Malibu Creek State Park and in the Santa Susana Mountains. In his veto message 
last week, Deukmejian said there were insufficient funds from a 1984 parkland 
bond act to make the purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Edmiston, the conservancy's executive director, said the organization 
would seek funds from other state sources for the land purchases. "I think we 
have a shot at that," he said.

TRAFFIC TO BE RESTRICTED FOR PIONEER BLVD. REPAVING JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Traffic on Pioneer Boulevard and some intersecting streets will be restricted 
when construction begins this month to repave the boulevard and install traffic 
signal control devices. 
</P>
<P>
Sully-Miller Contracting Co. of Long Beach, lowest of six bidders, will do the 
work under a $302,969 contract awarded by the County Board of Supervisors, 
Supervisor Deane Dana announced. The project is estimated to take about 30 
working days. 
</P>
<P>
Construction will extend 1 1/4 miles from just north of Los Coyotes Boulevard 
to Carson Street. A small portion of Pioneer Boulevard touches Cerritos at the 
northern end, and another small portion touches Hawaiian Gardens on the south, 
but the majority of the work will be in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
On Pioneer, traffic will be reduced to two lanes during working hours, but 
three lanes, including a left-right turn lane, will be available all other 
times. Del Amo Boulevard at its intersection with Pioneer also will be reduced 
to one lane in each direction. Traffic signal loop detectors, which sense the 
presence of vehicles and trigger signal changes, will be installed at Pioneer 
and Carson.

HOTEL INITIATIVE DRIVE BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Santa Monicans for a Livable Environment kicked off its signature-gathering 
campaign last week for a ballot initiative that would establish a three-year 
ban on hotel development and use a portion of hotel bed taxes from beachfront 
hotels to clean up Santa Monica Bay and city parks. 
</P>
<P>
The initiative would exempt beachfront hotels proposed by Maguire Thomas 
Partners on Ocean Avenue and by Michael McCarty on the site of the Sand and Sea 
Club on Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
Thom Poffenberger, a consultant to the group, said he expects to collect 
between 10,000 and 12,000 signatures within four weeks. The signatures of 15% 
of the city's registered voters, or 8,420 signatures, are need to qualify for 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
A competing initiative circulated by a group called Save Our Beach would ban 
all hotel development more than 2,000 square feet, including the McCarty and 
Maguire Thomas projects. 
</P>
<P>
Both initiatives are expected to qualify for the ballot, and a special election 
may be held as early as November. A spokesman for the city clerk said the city 
is required to hold a special election within 88 to 103 days after signatures 
are verified.

W. HOLLYWOOD HIKES RENT REGISTRATION FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDRA SMITH, Community Correspondent 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The West Hollywood City Council has approved several key provisions of the 
city's proposed $40.8-million budget, including the doubling of rent 
registration fees to raise $900,000 in new revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Although tenants pay the fee now, the increase would be paid by landlords. As 
approved at a public hearing on Monday evening, the monthly rate would be 
increased from $4 to $8. 
</P>
<P>
The increase, aimed at making the Department of Rent Stabilization 
self-sufficient, was among several items ironed out during the last of three 
sessions dealing with the budget for the fiscal year that began July 1. The 
council is scheduled to adopt the budget next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Steve Schulte tried to remove the fee increase from the budget but 
was voted down 4 to 1. Schulte's proposal to limit the increase to $2 a month 
was defeated 3 to 2, with Councilman Paul Koretz joining Schulte. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Too Much, Too Soon' 
</P>
<P>
The fee is "too much, too soon," Koretz said. "It's too much of a jolt for 
people." However, Koretz later voted with the rest of the council against 
Schulte in approving the increase while directing the city staff to develop a 
program that will exempt low-income owners and the owners of small buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Schulte argued that landlords should not have to pay for a program that 
primarily benefits renters. He proposed instead that the city raise revenues by 
increasing transient occupancy taxes or parking meter fees. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman John Heilman argued that landlords do use the services of the 
Rent Stabilization Department "and in some cases, even benefit from those 
services." 
</P>
<P>
About 15 West Hollywood landlords argued against the fee increase. 
</P>
<P>
"Those people who benefit from the (rent control) ordinance should pay for it," 
said Grafton Tanquary, who heads West Hollywood Concerned Citizens, a landlord 
group. 
</P>
<P>
"In Santa Monica, renters pay the full costs of their rent control program," 
Tanquary said. "I think the renters of West Hollywood would consider an $8 fee 
a bargain compared to what they're saving in rent." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Council Urged to Wait 
</P>
<P>
Schulte also sought to remove from the budget a business license tax proposal 
that would raise $1 million. He argued that the council should wait until a 
system for collecting the revenues and a fee schedule are developed. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at a situation that needs a lot more analysis," Schulte said. 
</P>
<P>
Koretz joined Schulte in opposing the business tax, saying higher rates could 
drive small businesses out of the city. 
</P>
<P>
But the motion failed, virtually assuring that the tax will be approved as part 
of the budget when the council meets next week. 
</P>
<P>
The council voted unanimously to reinstate $65,000 to help start an adult day 
health care program for senior citizens and AIDS patients, $50,000 for 
immigrant programs, $64,000 for social service programs' cost-of-living 
adjustments, $35,000 for child care, and $25,000 for a rental assistance 
program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restored Shelter Funds 
</P>
<P>
It also voted to restore $45,000 to continue funding a temporary homeless 
shelter at West Hollywood Park until the beginning of next year, when a 
permanent shelter on the city's east side is expected to open. 
</P>
<P>
Funding for five council deputies was also reinstated. City Manager Paul 
Brotzman had suggested replacing the deputies, who serve at the pleasure of the 
five council members, with three analysts under his supervision, a change he 
said would pare $120,000 from the budget. However, a majority of council 
members were not in favor of the idea. 
</P>
<P>
About $170,000 was cut from the budget, including $25,000 for tree trimming, 
$11,400 in training programs for city staff, $1,000 for a facsimile machine at 
the West Hollywood Sheriff's Station, and $93,000 for an in-house print shop at 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The council also voted to raise parking meter fees from 50 to 75 cents an hour. 
Officials expect the increase to raise an additional $400,000 to $500,000 in 
revenue.

STUDIES ORDERED FOR OLD MASONRY BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SPENCER S. HSU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calling the risk too great to ignore, the Santa Monica City Council is 
requiring all owners of pre-1933 unreinforced masonry buildings to conduct 
seismic engineering studies by next January to determine the structures' 
resistance to earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
The council stopped short of proposing specific corrective measures, saying it 
was unprepared to do so because of conflicting data about how dangerous the 
buildings are. The council instead voted at its Tuesday night meeting to gather 
more expert opinion before determining later this year what constitutes an 
adequate level of safety. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the city has 183 unreinforced masonry buildings built before 
1933. Four are residential buildings, but most are commercial or mixed-use 
structures, with the bulk of them in the downtown business district. Under a 
1986 state law, the city is required to make an inventory of its old masonry 
buildings, set up a program for making them safe and report back to the state 
on their progress by Jan. 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some Latitude 
</P>
<P>
Although cities have some latitude in how they comply with the law, the state 
recommends that all unreinforced masonry buildings constructed before 1933 be 
divided into risk groups depending on their use and occupancy. Load-bearing 
walls should then be reinforced, with priority given to the buildings found 
most dangerous. The state program is modeled after one instituted by the city 
of Los Angeles in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica's Building and Safety Commission held two public hearings last 
winter on implementing the state law but concluded that additional studies 
would be necessary to determine the safety of the buildings and what 
corrections were needed. 
</P>
<P>
Testimony by experts and members of the public Tuesday and at last winter's 
sessions showed clear differences of opinion about the ability of pre-1933 
masonry buildings to withstand earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
Points of dispute focus on determining buildings' resistance to ground forces 
generated by earthquakes, the actual potential for a damaging quake and the 
cost of upgrading buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The council authorized the city staff to determine the best scientific 
standards for assessing the risk of earthquake damage in the buildings and to 
reconcile contradictory or competing claims of hazard. The staff will also 
determine cost estimates based on Los Angeles' figures from its 1980 ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be some misinformation in the community, as well as honest 
disagreement" about how dangerous the buildings are, said Mayor Dennis Zane. 
"It would be irresponsible of us if we did not impose this moderate (step) of 
implementing these tests." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from Los Angeles, several other major cities in the area have already 
conducted inventories and adopted a version of the state's suggested mitigation 
program. They include Long Beach, Torrance, Pasadena and Beverly Hills, 
according to Karl Deppe, a senior engineer with the Los Angeles Building and 
Safety Department. 
</P>
<P>
The studies authorized by the council Tuesday are preliminary measures 
estimated to cost property owners between $1,000 and $4,000 per building. The 
studies consist of an analysis by a state-licensed structural engineer of the 
building plans and tests of the strength of the building's bearing walls based 
on one or two sites on each wall. The procedure takes at most a few days. 
</P>
<P>
As part of its compliance with the 1986 law, the council ordered environmental 
impact studies to clear the way for any eventual corrective program that is 
adopted. The environmental studies are expected to cost the city $40,000 to 
$60,000. The six-month timetable for seismic studies means that the city will 
not meet the Jan. 1 state deadline, but the law contains no late penalty.

CHANGE SOUGHT IN AIRPORT BOARD MAKEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leaders of anti-noise groups and state legislators are working together to 
challenge the makeup of the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority as a 
method to thwart plans for the expansion of Burbank Airport. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Close of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. and Tom Paterson of the 
North Hollywood Residents Assn. said they want to amend existing legislation to 
put more members representing Burbank on the authority. They also want 
representation for Los Angeles residents affected by noise. Three members each 
from Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena sit on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
They said Glendale and Pasadena representatives have been unresponsive to 
residents near the airport who have complained about noise from airplanes 
flying over their homes. 
</P>
<P>
"The way it's structured now, the people who are most affected by the airport 
have no real power in the decision-making governing the airport," Paterson 
said. "Burbank should exercise primary control of that airport. After all, it's 
in their city. It's an idea whose time has come." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Approached 
</P>
<P>
Anti-noise advocates have approached Assemblymen Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) and 
Terry B. Friedman (D-Los Angeles), as well as Burbank officials, in their 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Friedman, who represents Studio City and Sherman Oaks, said he is drafting 
legislation to change the board's composition. 
</P>
<P>
"The interests of Los Angeles and Burbank residents have to be protected," he 
said. "The majority of the authority (has) been so unresponsive to my 
constituents that I would oppose any expansion of the airport. We should all 
equally share the burdens and the benefits of the airport." 
</P>
<P>
But there is already uncertainty and opposition to the suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a game that these people have played time and time again," said 
Carl Mesick, who represents Glendale on the board. "The bottom line is, they 
just want to shut Burbank Airport down. This is nothing new." 
</P>
<P>
Even Burbank officials doubt that the shift would work. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank City Councilwoman Mary Lou Howard, who is on the airport board, said: 
"We've thought about doing this before -- becoming full owners of the airport 
and buying the other cities out. I would not be opposed to it, but I don't 
believe the other cities are willing for Burbank to control this airport." 
</P>
<P>
Burbank Mayor Robert R. Bowne said: "The fact that the city does have the 
airport within its boundaries does make it reasonable for Burbank to have more 
influence, but I'm not about to start a crusade over it. I'm not sure it could 
ever happen." 
</P>
<P>
The three cities purchased the airport from Lockheed Corp. in 1978 for $51 
million. Under state law, a joint-powers agreement was established by the three 
cities to set up the airport authority. Each city appoints three 
representatives to serve on the authority, and each city has equal 
responsibility for the facility's operation. 
</P>
<P>
Close and Paterson complained that Glendale and Pasadena commissioners don't 
care about the airport's impact on Burbank. They cited a recent authority 
decision rejecting the Burbank City Council's request to switch authority 
meetings from morning to evening so that more residents could attend. 
</P>
<P>
They said Glendale and Pasadena have refused to share noise from planes routed 
over Burbank and other areas of the San Fernando Valley and have been 
indifferent to complaints about flight patterns. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposed New Terminal 
</P>
<P>
Those same residents are now worried about the size of a proposed new terminal, 
the added noise from an increased number of flights, and the effects such 
changes will have on community traffic and development. 
</P>
<P>
"Burbank Airport is being run for the benefit of Pasadena and Glendale and to 
the detriment of Burbank," Close said. "These cities look upon the airport as a 
spark plug for business and convenient transportation for their residents. Only 
Los Angeles and Burbank see the harm the airport is causing. It's not fair that 
Burbank can't control its own destiny." 
</P>
<P>
David Robinson, a commissioner representing Pasadena, disagreed. "The duty of 
each commissioner is not to be responsive to a city, but to do what's right for 
the airport. The authority is a separate public entity. I feel the commission 
is responsive to Burbank's concerns, and to the concerns of other cities."

SANTA MONICA TO SEEK SITES FOR HOMELESS;

<P>
FRONT LAWN OF CITY HALL AMONG THE POSSIBILITIES FOR TEMPORARY CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not all of William H. Jennings' Santa Monica City Council colleagues were ready 
Tuesday night to embrace his idea to move the homeless to the front lawn of 
City Hall, but they did unanimously agree to find some public open land -- 
perhaps the City Hall lawn -- within the next six months to house the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager John Jalili was told to form an advisory committee to help find 
appropriate sites that could temporarily house homeless people. Jalili will 
also return in six months with an explanation of the costs involved in setting 
up such a proposal, possible sources for funding and how the plan would work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Look 
</P>
<P>
Jalili will also contact officials from surrounding areas to seek their 
participation in a broader program to deal with the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The discussion Tuesday night, which began about 11:30 p.m. and continued to 
nearly 1 a.m., quickly became heated when Jennings asked the council to commit 
itself to opening the front lawn of City Hall for the homeless. He accused the 
city of doing little to really help the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"We may be making people comfortable, but what have we done to make them 
unhomeless?" Jennings asked his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lawn a Symbol 
</P>
<P>
Jennings said his proposal is to take a long-term look at the homeless problem 
by providing temporary housing, identifying those who want and can get jobs, 
sort out the criminal element, and return parks and beaches to the public. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe we have done anything but perpetuate the problem," Jennings 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman David B. Finkel said he generally supported Jennings' proposal, but 
disputed his contention that the city has not done anything for the homeless. 
He argued that the lawn may not be the appropriate site for such a camp. 
</P>
<P>
"The simple fact is that this city has done more than any other city in the 
country for the homeless," Finkel said. 
</P>
<P>
Finkel then made an alternative motion to find public open space other than 
City Hall for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
The discussion then centered on the appropriateness of the City Hall lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Christine Reed favored the lawn, saying it would be a symbol, 
particularly to residents, that city government was doing something about the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
"If we do not offer City Hall, which is our workplace, our front yard, what are 
we then saying to our residents?" Reed asked. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Dennis Zane argued that moving the homeless to City Hall would not help 
solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
"City Hall is not an invitation to a successful program, it is an invitation to 
a circus," Zane said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Activist's Support 
</P>
<P>
Finkel agreed to amend his proposal to include City Hall as one of the possible 
sites, and Jennings agreed to support the motion.

<P>
Homeless activist Ted Hayes appeared at the council meeting to support 
Jennings' proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the right direction," Hayes said. "Provide some land for the homeless. 
Their lives have to be stabilized. Set up a pilot program, work out the kinks. 
Prove that it can be done, then other cities will participate." 
</P>
<P>
Hayes, who helped organize a tent city last year on Venice Beach, wants to put 
the homeless in igloo-like structures called geodesic domes. The 
14-feet-by-9-feet domes house two people and can easily be moved.

CHANGE IN FOCUS RENEWS ANTI-GANG GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A month ago, Steve Valdivia, director of Community Youth Gang Services, Los 
Angeles' largest civilian gang prevention program, had his head handed to him 
by several members of the Los Angeles City Council. They chewed him out in 
public over an alleged $600,000 budget overrun and then ordered an independent 
review of the program's effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
The flap could not have come at a worse time. It rekindled memories that the 
organization has been struggling to escape -- only recently with any success -- 
since its creation in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
During the last two years, Valdivia has managed to win a significant amount of 
respectability for Community Youth Gang Services, which has long been the 
target of skepticism and criticism. He has done it by dramatically broadening 
the program's objectives and downplaying its original purpose: hitting the 
streets to cool down potentially deadly squabbles between members of rival 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
No longer is the group a collection of street workers, many of them ex-gang 
members, who cruise dangerous neighborhoods, attempting to establish empathic 
relationships with young outlaws. 
</P>
<P>
Now the 75-member staff consists largely of better-educated employees who spend 
their time in less perilous surroundings, teaching Say-No-to-Gang classes in 
elementary schools, organizing community demonstrations outside rock houses and 
circulating flyers encouraging inner-city residents to "reclaim" their parks. 
</P>
<P>
The byword at the agency used to be "intervention" -- stepping into gang 
disputes that might spill into violence in a few hours. Today it is 
"prevention" -- community programs that might pay off in a few years, or 
perhaps a decade. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago the group's crisis-intervention workers cruised the streets until 
11 p.m. These days they are off the streets within an hour after nightfall. 
Life is simply too dangerous and too unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I just don't want them out there," Valdivia said. 
</P>
<P>
The intent of restructuring the program is to treat gangs as "a disease -- the 
only disease that hasn't been dealt with on a preventive basis," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because of this shift -- and despite the fact that gang-related homicides in 
Los Angeles County have increased 113% in the last four years -- Community 
Youth Gang Services today enjoys a level of popularity and bureaucratic support 
that it was never able to achieve as long as it was committed primarily to 
working directly with gang members. 
</P>
<P>
As a program committed to intervention, it was plagued by suggestions from law 
enforcement spokesmen and many politicians that it was too sympathetic to the 
unsavory young men it sought to counsel. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, for many years, its funding from the county Board of Supervisors 
and Los Angeles City Council was stuck at about $2 million a year, causing 
staffing to gradually drop nearly 40%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rises to $3 Million 
</P>
<P>
However, in the budget year that began this month, the joint city-county 
contribution to Community Youth Gang Services will rise 50%, to $3 million, 
specifically to help it expand its nonintervention programs. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the organization continues to enjoy the image of an influential 
street-level agency. Dozens of reporters have come to Los Angeles in the last 
year to profile the region as the nation's gang-murder capital, and virtually 
all of them -- desperate for a way to talk to gang members -- have made 
Community Youth Gang Services' East Los Angeles headquarters their first stop. 
The group's own brochure boasts: "We have the one thing it takes to make an 
impression on gangs -- their respect." 
</P>
<P>
However, interviews with dozens of gang members by The Times last year 
indicated little respect -- and in many cases outright contempt -- for the 
agency. Gang members routinely claim that Community Youth Gang Services workers 
feed information about rival gangs to police, an allegation the group denies. 
</P>
<P>
Community Youth Gang Services has never had a strong presence in the black 
neighborhoods of South Los Angeles, where the worst spasms of gang violence 
occur, according to law enforcement specialists and nonprofit groups that work 
with young people. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is that the agency -- which has never had a black 
administrator and was created at a time when violence by Latino gangs drew more 
publicity than black gangs -- has long been criticized by black nonprofit 
groups as being more sensitive to Latino neighborhoods than black ones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Markedly Distrustful 
</P>
<P>
But another part of the problem is beyond the organization's control. Today's 
black gangs are markedly more distrustful of any outside presence -- civil or 
police -- than their Latino counterparts. The introduction of rock cocaine into 
Los Angeles in the last five years and the involvement of many black gang 
members in sales created a chain reaction in which more money became available 
for more dangerous weapons and the destructive social influence of crack 
created a more unstable society. 
</P>
<P>
While Community Youth Gang Services recently threw most of its manpower into 
South Los Angeles, only 16 of the 48 staff members assigned there do gang 
intervention work. The rest work in schools, parks, job development and 
community organizing. 
</P>
<P>
The pull away from the streets reflects a consensus that has been building 
throughout the decade among gang-prevention specialists: New generations of 
gang members are so hardened and so resistant to counseling that they are, in 
many cases, beyond the influence of traditional street workers. With funds 
limited at all levels of government, this thinking goes, it makes more sense to 
spend money educating younger children and their parents about the evils of 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to do it (intervention), but it's not a priority anymore," said 
Schuyler Sprowles, a former aide to Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner who recently became 
a Community Youth Gang Services consultant and is coordinating a drive to raise 
$1 million from private donors to finance more CYGS anti-gang classes in public 
schools. "It's a matter of getting the most bang for your bucks." 
</P>
<P>
As his staff shrunk progressively over the years, Valdivia said, it became 
impossible for his group to claim it was having an impact on the gang problem. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New 'Target Areas' 
</P>
<P>
So in an effort to prove the program could make a dent, Valdivia last February 
put his most trusted crisis-intervention workers into four new "target areas," 
consisting of the Los Angeles Police Department's 77th and Southeast Divisions 
and the county Sheriff's Department's Lennox and Lynwood stations. 
</P>
<P>
He cut back or eliminated many operations in other parts of the county and 
formed teams in each target area. Each team had a separate specialty: removing 
gang graffiti, community organizing, working at job referrals or teaching 
one-hour-a-day, 15-week anti-gang classes at local schools. 
</P>
<P>
A number of intervention workers, members of what Valdivia calls "the old 
CYGS," were fired. 
</P>
<P>
The changes represent "a wiser deployment of staff on Steve's part," said Mike 
Duran, head of the county Probation Department's gang unit. "He has been able 
to sift out a whole lot of staff that couldn't do the job and has brought in 
new staff that is willing to work and make things happen." 
</P>
<P>
Valdivia was named director of Community Youth Gang Services in 1983, leaving 
an East Los Angeles community-services program to take the job. He benefited 
immediately from the fact that countywide gang deaths had already begun 
dropping, but by 1984 that pattern was reversed. 
</P>
<P>
In other agencies that work with CYGS, Valdivia has a reputation for 
defensiveness, though few question his sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem he's had is that he has to keep changing his program to appease 
the politicians because they make decisions on how much to fund him every 
year," said the director of another government-funded anti-gang program, 
speaking on the condition he not be identified. "He has to keep justifying his 
existence. The bad thing about preventive programs is that you can't gauge 
prevention. That sort of program shouldn't be held (political) hostage." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 50% increase in his 1989-90 budget, Valdivia four weeks ago 
persuaded the City Council to approve an extra $600,000 in interim funding, but 
only after receiving a tongue-lashing for what several council members 
characterized as an unauthorized expansion of services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Confusing Confrontation 
</P>
<P>
It was a confusing confrontation that illustrated the emotional politics of Los 
Angeles' frustrating and foundering war against gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
Valdivia sought the interim increase last March to restore services to areas 
that had been cut in the Southside buildup, such as the San Fernando Valley and 
East Los Angeles. The extra money also was to finance replacement of the 
program's aging car fleet. 
</P>
<P>
Valdivia asked his closest City Council ally, Councilman Richard Alatorre, to 
introduce a motion providing the additional financing. But when the council 
vote was delayed, Valdivia decided to take a calculated risk. Knowing he was 
going to receive a sizable increase in his regular budget, effective Oct. 1, he 
hired additional personnel during the spring, recognizing he would have to 
terminate about 18 of them temporarily if formal council approval of the 
interim funds was denied. 
</P>
<P>
When the full council finally voted on the interim increase on June 16, there 
was outrage at what Valdivia had done, even though two high-ranking officials 
of the LAPD testified in support of extra money for CYGS. The council was 
particularly irked because it has been trying to exercise more control over 
bureaucrats deemed to be acting too independently. 
</P>
<P>
To Councilman Joel Wachs, Valdivia had committed "probably as bad a management 
as I have ever heard of." To a sympathetic City Council aide, he had done "the 
gutsiest thing anyone's done in years." 
</P>
<P>
Community Youth Gang Services has long been on the hot seat because it is a 
bureaucratic rarity. Seldom have Los Angeles' government agencies been willing 
to spend so much money on anything other than law enforcement to combat gangs. 
City and county officials have traditionally resisted calls for greater 
preventive spending. The theory that there is a correlation between rising gang 
crime and deep cuts made in social programs since passage of Proposition 13 in 
1978 has not been a popular one among local politicians. 
</P>
<P>
The program was created in desperation in 1981 by the supervisors after annual 
gang-related homicides in the county passed 350. The program was modeled after 
Philadelphia's crisis-intervention program. 
</P>
<P>
Personnel problems abounded. The first two directors were fired or quit within 
two years. Several staff members were arrested on robbery or drug charges. 
</P>
<P>
Gang members accused CYGS workers of being little more than law enforcement 
snitches. Leaders of some South Los Angeles nonprofit organizations -- often 
jealous that the group was receiving the lion's share of local gang 
violence-prevention funds -- belittled the program as an ineffective sham that 
had insufficient black representation.

FATHER CASASSA, FORMER HEAD OF LOYOLA MARYMOUNT, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Father Charles S. Casassa -- a Jesuit adherent for 60 years, a priest for more 
than 50 and a courageous and innovative administrator at what now is Loyola 
Marymount University for more than 40 -- died Wednesday morning at St. John's 
Hospital in Santa Monica after a long illness. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
To many, Casassa was a Southland institution -- a civic leader who supported 
civil rights before such stances were popular, a leader of ecumenism before the 
breakthroughs of Vatican II, a man whose personal concerns ranged from an 
intercultural camp for children to a coalition on aging. 
</P>
<P>
His principled stands while chancellor at then-Loyola University were 
legendary. 
</P>
<P>
In 1949, he canceled a university football game with a college that refused to 
permit Loyola's blacks to play. That same year, he barred a fraternity that 
discriminated against minorities from chartering a chapter at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
In the interests of educational quality and fiscal responsibility, he abolished 
the university's football program. He admitted women to the previously all-male 
undergraduate program at Loyola and, despite some opposition from those in the 
church hierarchy, oversaw the affiliation that eventually became a merger of 
Loyola and Marymount universities. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Alfred Wolf of the Wilshire Boulevard Temple, who knew Casassa through 
their mutual efforts to develop religious understanding, said Wednesday that 
the Jesuit was a man "who stuck his neck out in inter-religious relations when 
it was not favored by the Catholic hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
"Father Casassa was the kind of Catholic who anticipated the spirit of the 
Vatican II Council before (Pope) John XXIII convened it, and he was the first 
to implement it in this area, at a time when others were reluctant to do so," 
Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
Born in San Francisco, Casassa owed his Irish wit to three of his grandparents 
and his Italian surname to the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
As a student at St. Ignatius High School in San Francisco, he found the 
scholastic life, and the Jesuit order that ran the school, appealing. After 
graduation, he entered the Jesuit seminary at Los Gatos, later studying at two 
Jesuit universities -- Santa Clara and Gonzaga -- from which he earned 
bachelor's and master's degrees, and the University of Toronto, where he got 
his Ph.D. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chosen as President 
</P>
<P>
He was teaching philosophy at Santa Clara in 1949 when the California province 
of the Jesuits chose him as president of Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
The school was small then, with only five buildings at its main campus in 
Westchester and one at the law school campus in downtown Los Angeles. Today, 
Loyola Marymount has more than 20 buildings in Westchester and four downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Casassa took credit for only 11, pointing out that many of the structures were 
erected during the administration of his successors. But friends say that after 
he left the presidency in 1969 -- assuming first the title of chancellor and 
later that of chancellor emeritus -- he continued to help raise the money that 
funded the university's building programs. 
</P>
<P>
It was early in his presidency, back in 1953, that Casassa founded the 
university's Summer Workshop in Human Relations. One of its more successful 
graduates was a young police officer, Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
After that came an interfaith workshop sponsored by Loyola, the American Jewish 
Congress and the National Council of Christians and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, then-Gov. Edmund G. Brown appointed Casassa to the McCone Commission, 
which studied the causes of the Watts riots earlier that year. 
</P>
<P>
Casassa was still serving as Loyola's president three years later when 
Marymount suggested an affiliation of the two schools. 
</P>
<P>
"Marymount had more in art and music; Loyola had more in science, engineering 
and business administration," Casassa said. "We felt Marymount could enrich our 
programs and that we could enrich theirs." 
</P>
<P>
Marymount moved to Loyola's Westchester campus in 1969; the two schools merged 
formally in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
By the time of the merger, Casassa had handed over the reins of the presidency 
and was serving as chancellor -- a job, he said, that primarily involved fund 
raising and public relations. His duties as chancellor emeritus, a post he 
assumed in 1984, were much the same, but the university's current president, 
Father James M. Loughran, said Casassa also served as a valuable and trusted 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
A wake service will be held Sunday at 7:30 p.m. at the Sacred Heart Chapel on 
the Westchester campus. A Mass of Resurrection will be celebrated Monday at 10 
a.m. also at the chapel. Burial will be at the Santa Clara Mission cemetery in 
Santa Clara on Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
In lieu of flowers, the Jesuit Community has requested contributions to the 
Casassa Executive Education Conference Center at Loyola Marymount.

L.A. AND OTHERS INVOLVED IN HUGE LAND SWAP TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER AND AMY PYLE, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A complex land swap that could help meet Los Angeles' pressing needs for a new 
landfill and more electrical power, transform dilapidated Hansen Dam into a 
major recreation area and preserve scenic canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains 
is under serious negotiation by federal, city, county and private interests. 
</P>
<P>
The outlines of the sweeping plan were contained in a bill introduced in 
Congress by Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) in February. For months, 
Berman and city and county officials have quietly been trying to hammer out the 
details of a broader agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"We are in sensitive negotiations that could easily be finalized within the 
next few weeks," said Deputy Mayor Mike Gage, one of the city's negotiators. 
"This is a very, very complicated process." 
</P>
<P>
Under consideration is a proposal that would: 
</P>
<P>
* Provide a new 200-million ton landfill in Elsmere Canyon, west of Santa 
Clarita, for Los Angeles city and county. 
</P>
<P>
* Acquire 5,900 acres of land in Nevada for the city of Los Angeles, allowing 
the city to obtain up to 30% of its future electricity from a coal-burning 
power plant in that state. 
</P>
<P>
* Obtain $300 million in the course of several decades to restore a lake and 
create athletic and park facilities at Hansen Dam in the northeast San Fernando 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
* Transfer ownership of Mission, Rustic and Sullivan canyons, between the San 
Diego Freeway and Topanga Canyon Boulevard in the Santa Monica Mountains, from 
Los Angeles County and the county Sanitation Districts to a state or federal 
park agency. 
</P>
<P>
* Close the city-operated Lopez Canyon Landfill in the East San Fernando 
Valley. Lopez Canyon and Hansen Dam are in Berman's 26th Congressional 
District. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Berman can craft a bill that gains the support of the city and county, 
various government agencies would subsequently have to approve many aspects of 
the agreement. The state Waste Management Board, for instance, would have to 
issue a permit for the Elsmere Canyon landfill, and the city and county would 
have to reach agreement on how to run it. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, an additional complication has been raised by Santa Monica real 
estate developer Ray A. Watt, one of Southern California's largest and most 
politically influential builders, who has put forward a competing proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Watt, who owns and has options on several strategically located parcels in Los 
Angeles County and Wyoming, has offered to help facilitate the deal. In 
exchange, he wants city approval to build 750 luxury homes off Mulholland Drive 
near Mission Canyon, west of the San Diego Freeway, and an unspecified 
percentage of the dumping fees the city and county governments would charge at 
Elsmere Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
To advance Watt's proposal, U.S. Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-Wyo.) plans to 
introduce a bill in the next few weeks that would swap rights to land Watt owns 
near Jackson Hole, Wyo. -- highly sought by the U.S. Forest Service -- in 
return for Elsmere Canyon, which is owned by the Forest Service, a spokesman 
for Wallop said. The city and county would get the canyon for a dumping ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Watt's interests are at least part of the negotiations," Gage said. 
"However, his initial proposal is totally unacceptable to the city." 
</P>
<P>
Berman said he had not been consulted about Wallop's measure but the two bills 
probably could be amended to be compatible. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said he flatly opposes part of Watt's plan. "Anything which 
involves commitments to build 750 houses in the Santa Monica Mountains is not 
going to bring all of us together," Berman said. "I won't have it." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach a spokesman at Watt Industries were unsuccessful. The company 
posted $420 million in housing sales in 1988, the second-highest figure in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The behind-the-scenes negotiations involve some of Los Angeles' most powerful 
figures. Attorney Richard J. Riordan has been brought in by the county and Watt 
is represented by the influential Los Angeles law firm of Manatt, Phelps, 
Rothenberg, Tunney &amp; Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
Berman is scheduled to meet today in Washington with Riordan's assistant, 
former Beverly Hills Mayor Robert K. Tanenbaum. Berman said that he had "no 
reason to believe" an agreement would be reached today, but he hoped to forge a 
final bill in the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Among the most controversial aspects of Berman's proposal are the closure of 
Lopez Canyon Landfill and the acquisition of Mission, Sullivan and Rustic 
Canyons. Either the state or federal parks departments or the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy would obtain the 2,396 canyon acres. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no single thing that you could do that would preserve as much parkland 
as this bill," said Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
But those canyons were purchased by Los Angeles County and the county 
Sanitation Districts in the 1950s and 1960s as future dumps and both entities 
are reluctant to give up the land, particularly since Los Angeles is fast 
running out of landfill space. 
</P>
<P>
"Taxpayers' money was used 30 years ago to acquire those," said Mark Volmert, 
deputy to county Supervisor Peter F. Schabarum. "They are consistently listed 
in the very top . . . landfill sites in the county. As such, I don't think the 
board is interested at all in giving those sites away." 
</P>
<P>
The city, which uses Lopez Canyon to dump more than half of the 6,000 tons of 
trash Los Angeles generates daily, is scheduled to shut down the landfill in 
1992. But the city hopes instead to expand it and continue to use it through at 
least 2001. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Clarita, the proposed Elsmere Canyon landill already has prompted 
formation of an anti-dump citizens' group. Mayor Jan Heidt said she personally 
is opposed to the landfill, but most of the City Council feels "this is a done 
deal and we might as well get what we can out of it." 
</P>
<P>
To sweeten the package for Santa Clarita, Berman's proposal calls for 
transferring to the city of Santa Clarita a former detoxification center owned 
by the city of Los Angeles for possible use as a civic center and park. 
</P>
<P>
In another series of land transactions, Berman is proposing that the U.S. 
Forest Service obtain 310 acres in Upper Franklin Canyon in the Santa Monicas 
from the city Department of Water and Power and nearly 1,000 acres elsewhere in 
Los Angeles County. This includes Big Tujunga, San Francisquito and Bouquet 
canyons. 
</P>
<P>
In return for giving up the land, the DWP is counting on the bill to facilitate 
its quest for electrical power by setting aside corridors of Nevada property 
owned by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management for power lines. The lines would 
carry electricity from a proposed coal-burning plant in White Pines, Nev., the 
kind of plant that environmental restrictions forbid in California. 
</P>
<P>
Eldon Cotton, the department's assistant general manager for power, said the 
plant could satisfy about a third of Los Angeles' electrical power needs for 
the next several hundred years. 
</P>
<P>
Berman also has long sought ways to revive the Hansen Dam Recreation Area, 
which has become a haven for the homeless after several large rainstorms filled 
its lake with silt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Proposed Land Swaps 
</P>
<P>
1.ELSMERE CANYON 
</P>
<P>
Proposal: For 900 acres of U.S. Forest Service land to become a landfill for 
Los Angeles city and county. 
</P>
<P>
2.LOPEZ CANYON 
</P>
<P>
LANDFILL 
</P>
<P>
Proposals: For the 392-acre city-owned landfill to close or for the U.S. Forest 
Service to gives the city 283 nearby acres for landfill buffer zone. 
</P>
<P>
3.HANSEN DAM RECREATION AREA 
</P>
<P>
Proposal: For 1,400 acres near the dam to be rehabilitated and developed with 
$300 million in dump fees from Elsmere Canyon landfill.

3 ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL IN 'COTTON CLUB' MURDER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After two months of court testimony that focused on the dark side of Hollywood 
deal making, a woman identified by authorities as a cocaine kingpin and two 
former bodyguards for Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt were ordered 
Wednesday to stand trial for the 1983 murder of theatrical producer Roy Radin. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Municipal Judge Patti Jo McKay ruled that there is 
sufficient evidence to bind Karen DeLayne (Lanie) Greenberger, Alex Marti and 
William Mentzer over for trial in a hearing that has become known as the 
"Cotton Club" murder case. 
</P>
<P>
McKay also decreed that the Radin murder may have been committed for financial 
gain, a move that would clear the way for the defendants to receive the death 
penalty if they are convicted. 
</P>
<P>
The case has captured widespread attention for its unsparing look at the film 
capital's unsavory side, its gruesome details and its occasional mentions of 
prominent Hollywood mogul Robert Evans -- who has not been charged in the case 
but was linked to the murder by a key prosecution witness. 
</P>
<P>
Radin, a 33-year-old New York entertainment figure, came to Los Angeles with 
dreams of gaining a foothold in the film business by consummating a production 
company deal with Evans. Instead, the corpulent, cocaine-snorting showman wound 
up in a desolate canyon with more than a dozen bullet holes in his head. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Anticipated Ruling 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said they anticipated McKay's ruling. In his closing arguments, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. David Conn charged that Greenberger ordered Radin's murder 
after he tried to cut her out of a production deal on "The Cotton Club," a film 
about the famous 1930s nightclub in Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Radin was an obstacle to further negotiation involving 'The Cotton Club,' 
" Conn said. " . . . The deal could not go through until specific issues such 
as percentages were worked out. It was at that time that Mrs. Greenberger had 
the motive to murder Mr. Radin." 
</P>
<P>
Conn said that Greenberger hired Marti and Mentzer to carry out the killing. In 
recounting court testimony, he said that the two bodyguards committed the 
murder after kidnaping Radin on the night of May 13, 1983, when the producer 
was on the way to a dinner engagement with Greenberger. 
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers did not rebut Conn's arguments, and Greenberger, Marti and 
Mentzer accepted McKay's ruling matter-of-factly before being led back to their 
holding cells. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Shohat, Greenberger's attorney, said the defense was "saving its 
arguments for another day." He said McKay's ruling was expected, even though 
defense lawyers believe it is incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants will be arraigned Tuesday, but their trial probably will not 
begin until next year. In the meantime, journalists, writers and film producers 
will have an opportunity to pore over about 4,500 pages of testimony produced 
during the long preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses testified that Greenberger, 42, a prim-looking woman with 
close-cropped silver-gray hair whom authorities described as a major drug 
dealer, proved to be Radin's undoing. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said Greenberger hired Marti, 27; Mentzer, 39, and Robert Lowe, 42 
-- a fourth defendant who spent the preliminary hearing fighting extradition 
from Maryland -- to carry out Radin's murder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Use of Cherry Bomb 
</P>
<P>
One prosecution witness said Greenberger told him: "They've got the fat pig and 
they're taking him to the desert." Another said the defendants placed a lighted 
cherry bomb in Radin's mouth to obscure his identity. 
</P>
<P>
After a brief friendship, relations between Greenberger and Radin soured, 
witnesses testified, when Greenberger accused Radin of helping to steal 
$200,000 in cash and 10 kilograms of cocaine from her home. 
</P>
<P>
The final straw came when Radin cut Greenberger out of the $26-million 
production deal he and Evans had lined up on "Cotton Club," prosecutors said. 
Radin was last seen stepping into a limousine with Greenberger on May 13. His 
corpse was found a month later. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, who was implicated by one witness, drew a packed crowd when he took the 
stand and nervously refused to testify because of concerns of 
self-incrimination. On another occasion, a star witness had to be led from the 
court shaken and sobbing when he confessed to being drunk. 
</P>
<P>
And just last week, as the high-security hearing was nearing its conclusion, 
the sound of gunfire sent everyone in McKay's courtroom scurrying for cover. 
Officials later discovered that a guard in a neighboring courtroom had 
accidentally fired his gun.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COAST PANEL GIVES OK FOR 'MINI-CITY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Coastal Commission on Wednesday approved changes in the local coastal 
plan that will allow developers to erect a "mini-city" on the site of the old 
Pike amusement park in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The mixed-use development of offices, shops, hotels and residences will 
eventually employ 8,000 workers and provide homes for 2,000 people. Scheduled 
for ground-breaking next year, the $1-billion project will be built in phases 
over a 13-year period by the development team of The Ratkovich Co. and 
Enterprise Development West Inc., a subsidiary of a James Rouse Co. 
</P>
<P>
While the commissioners unanimously approved coastal plan amendments to permit 
a much larger development than previously envisioned for the 13-acre waterfront 
site, they expressed concerns about traffic congestion and air pollution 
associated with the massive project. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Charles Warren also expressed doubt that people who worked in the 
complex's offices and shops would also live there -- a scenario that the 
developers have been painting as a way of cutting down on commuter traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"We are doing this, assured of results each of us knows will not be attained. 
I'm troubled by this, but I'm not sure what we can do about it," Warren said.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRADLEY OFF TO JAPAN FOR CITY'S CENTENNIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mayor Tom Bradley flew to Japan on Wednesday to participate in a centennial 
celebration for the city of Nagoya, which has been one of Los Angeles' sister 
cities for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
Nagoya, Japan's third-largest city, has a population of 2.5 million and is 
located in the center of the country. It is noted for its strong emphasis on 
city planning and urban design. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government declared 1989 the year of design, and in keeping with 
the theme, Bradley will speak at the opening ceremony of the World Design 
Exposition on Friday. He is due to return to Los Angeles on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Bradley will participate in a summit where leaders from Nagoya, 
Los Angeles and the Japanese city's two other sister cities, Mexico City and 
Sydney, Australia, will share ideas about planning, housing, family care and a 
host of other issues.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ALIENS ACCUSED OF MUSIC TAPE SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Twelve illegal aliens were arrested early Wednesday on suspicion of 
manufacturing and distributing thousands of counterfeit music cassette tapes, 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made in three raids by sheriff's deputies and Justice 
Department agents. Also seized were about 100,000 counterfeit tapes and at 
least three recording machines, Sgt. Robert Petitt said. 
</P>
<P>
The tapes were intended for sale on street corners and at swap meets, Petitt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The raids were conducted at 9528 S. Alameda St. and 678 S. Ford Blvd., Los 
Angeles and at 3146 Indiana Ave., South Gate, Petitt said. 
</P>
<P>
The 12 were booked on charges of violating state laws against manufacturing 
counterfeit audio cassettes and of violating federal statutes against 
infringement on copyrights and trafficking in counterfeit goods, Petitt said.

FINAL REPORT ORDERED ON MALIBU GOLF PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH J. GARCIA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission on Wednesday ordered 
completion of a final environmental impact report on a controversial project to 
transform a 340-acre Malibu canyon into a private 18-hole golf course and 
country club. 
</P>
<P>
The project was widely attacked at Wednesday's hearing by environmental 
consultants and homeowners groups who want to preserve the wild area. Local 
conservationists say the Malibu Country Club proposal would threaten sensitive 
watersheds, destroy wildlife and vegetation, and worsen traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
However, at least two planning commissioners, Paul Robinson and Lee Strong, 
said they favor the project, especially if the final environmental study, 
prepared by consultants to the developers, answers critical questions about 
sewage disposal and parking. That report is expected to be presented to the 
commission Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
"I think some serious thought has gone into it, and I think it's a good project 
for that area," Strong said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Massive Grading 
</P>
<P>
The $35-million project, if approved, would allow grading of more than 5 
million cubic yards of earth and the construction of 60 homes, a 
52,000-square-foot clubhouse, six tennis courts, two restaurants, a swimming 
pool and underground parking. It would be located on land recently sold by 
comedian Bob Hope to the Sun Pacific Co., a development group, which contends 
that the exclusive golf complex would be a good use for the upscale Malibu 
area. 
</P>
<P>
Several environmental consultants hired by the Corral Canyon Homeowners Assn. 
disagreed during the three-hour public hearing Wednesday. They said that the 
development would irreparably harm several environmentally sensitive wildlife 
habitats and that the proposed use of pesticides would threaten drinking water 
supplies. And they said not enough study has been done at the site, which is in 
a landslide area and is crossed by the Malibu Coast Fault. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a fantasy to even think that you could restore the area to its natural 
state," said Rudi Mattoni, a population biologist. The developers have said 
they plan to restore natural vegetation and wildlife once the golf course is 
built. 
</P>
<P>
The site, between Corral Canyon and Puerco Canyon roads north of Pacific Coast 
Highway, has been sought by the National Park Service for inclusion in the 
Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. However, insufficient funds 
and the developers' wish to pursue the golf course project have blocked 
acquisition plans. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney McClue Jr., executive vice president of Sun Pacific, told commissioners 
that the project offers a chance to preserve up to 95% of the project as open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
"Golf course management is an extremely sophisticated science today," he said. 
"We will avoid significant impacts to vegetation, water and wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
McClue downplayed the impact of the vast amount of grading proposed at the 
site, saying the commissioners should "look not at each individual part . . . 
but at the sum of the parts." 
</P>
<P>
However, Commissioner Betty Fisher said the panel needs to consider the large 
scope of the project, its impact on traffic and sewage and whether it is 
consistent with the lland use plan for Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a huge project, and we might as well admit as much," she said. "We 
just can't put that aside. And we'd better be very, very sure that if we 
approve this project, all of these important questions are answered."

SCHULTE CRITICIZES PROPOSAL TO BUY OFFICE BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city of West Hollywood has offered to buy a vacant office building owned by 
a major developer, drawing criticism from a dissident city councilman who 
contends that the offer "smacked of favoritism." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's suspect at the very least, (and) the timing was wrong," 
Councilman Steve Schulte said. The plan, approved by the City Council last 
week, calls for the city to buy the building at 7362 Santa Monica Blvd. from 
Raleigh Enterprises for $575,000. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the proposal, city officials, who want to use the building to house 
offices for several social service programs, have offered to provide Raleigh 
with a letter that suggests the city is prepared to condemn the property, 
Schulte said. 
</P>
<P>
But Schulte insisted that city officials have no intention of condemning the 
two-story building, saying the real purpose of the letter would be to enable 
Raleigh to defer capital gains taxes if the offer is accepted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not in City Plans 
</P>
<P>
"This is a building that's not in our capital improvement plan, that costs over 
half a million dollars at a time when we're pinching pennies with the (city) 
budget, and is owned by a major developer who's likely to be before the council 
with a new project in the not-too-distant future," Schulte said. 
</P>
<P>
Company President George Rosenthal is vice chairman of West Hollywood Marketing 
Corp., a private, nonprofit group that promotes West Hollywood business and 
industry. He has extensive real estate holdings in West Hollywood, including 
the Sunset Marquis Hotel and the building that houses Playboy Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal has expressed interest in developing a large commercial and 
residential project on one of the last remaining vacant sites along the Sunset 
Strip. The project, in the early stages of planning, would need City Council 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
The council approved the purchase offer for the office building last week on a 
4-1 vote, with Schulte dissenting. The terms of the arrangement were not 
disclosed. They were approved during an executive session of the council the 
previous week, City Manager Paul Brotzman said. 
</P>
<P>
Schulte's view was not shared by other council members. 
</P>
<P>
"I understand what Steve's concerns were, but I don't think they had much 
merit," Councilman Paul Koretz said. 
</P>
<P>
Koretz said he voted to approve the offer "because it appears to make sense for 
the city to acquire its own building to house social service programs as 
opposed to spending money to pay for the agencies to rent space elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Of the offer to condemn the property, Koretz said: "That was something we would 
have done for anyone else. . . . I don't see it as a controversial issue. If 
and when (Rosenthal) comes before the council seeking approval of a project, 
the project will be treated with the same scrutiny reserved for anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
Brotzman, who recommended that the city buy the building, requested that the 
matter be placed on the council agenda last week. It appeared among numerous 
items on the consent calendar, a part of the agenda reserved for items that may 
be approved en masse without discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Schulte was upset that the item on the agenda related to the purchase contained 
neither the location of the property nor the proposed purchase price. At his 
insistance, the matter was removed from the consent calendar for further 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Privileged Information 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to sound unduly critical of my colleagues," Schulte said. "Nine 
times out of 10 when the city manager comes to the council with a 
recommendation for purchasing property, the council is going to go along." 
</P>
<P>
Brotzman declined to comment on the terms of the offer, saying the information 
was privileged. He said that to discuss the matter might damage future 
negotiations for the property. 
</P>
<P>
Gregor Momdjian, vice president of real estate for Raleigh Enterprises, 
referred questions about the matter to Rosenthal, who was unavailable for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
The city's plans for the two-story building, across the street from Plummer 
Park on the city's east side, call for using the first floor to house an adult 
health-care program for senior citizens and AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
The council Monday approved spending $65,000 in "seed money" for the program, 
provided city officials can raise $50,000 to $100,000 from government and 
private sources to get the program off the ground. The council has yet to 
decide whether the program, if it becomes a reality, will be operated by the 
city or a private agency. 
</P>
<P>
City officials want to use the upstairs of the building to house other social 
services agencies with which it contracts for services, Brotzman said. 
</P>
<P>
Brotzman characterized the proposal to buy the property as "an attractive 
purchase price." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Savings Cited 
</P>
<P>
Officials say the city could save money by having the agencies occupy a 
building the city owns. Instead of reimbursing the agencies for renting space 
elsewhere, the city would essentially be reimbursing itself by having the 
agencies as tenants. 
</P>
<P>
"We sent letters to social service agencies at the end of last week inquiring 
as to whether they would be interested in moving (into the building), and we've 
already received three encouraging replies," said Jodi Curlee, the city's 
director of social services. 
</P>
<P>
However, critics of the plan remained skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"Does this mean the city is going to strong-arm the agencies by saying, 'If you 
don't move into our building, we don't need what you have to offer?' " 
community activist Steve Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what you say about the merits of how the building is actually used, 
I'm disturbed by the way the secretive way the whole affair was handled," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Settle, who chairs a subcommittee of the Public Facilities Board 
concerned with acquisition of public buildings, expressed a similar opinion. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say whether it is a good deal or not, but what disturbs me is that the 
board was never informed," he said. "I think that says something for the way 
things get done around here."

LANDLORDS REJECT RENT PLAN, CALL IT A SHAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Calling it a sham, a group of Santa Monica landlords has overwhelmingly 
rejected a Rent Control Board program that would allow them to sharply increase 
rents on some apartments if they set aside an equal number of units for 
low-income tenants at lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
The rejection Monday night by 98% of about 500 members of Action, Santa 
Monica's principal landlord group, leaves in question a program that only last 
month was being hailed by landlords and tenants as historic and a breakthrough 
in the city's most divisive issue: rent control. 
</P>
<P>
The program, agreed upon by three landlord representatives and two Rent Control 
Board officials, addresses two elusive goals of rent control: making 
inexpensive housing available to poor people while providing landlords with a 
fair return on their property. It takes effect in September. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica's rent control ordinance, adopted 10 years ago, is considered one 
of the toughest in the nation partly because it has not allowed vacancy 
decontrol, the ability to raise rents when tenants move out. The new program, 
called inclusionary housing, would open the door a crack for vacancy decontrol. 
Participation by landlords is voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Enough 
</P>
<P>
But the prospect of making even a dent in the city's tough rent control 
ordinance apparently was not enough for most members of Action. 
</P>
<P>
In an emotional meeting, most of the audience in the nearly full auditorium at 
Lincoln Junior High School stood, applauded and cheered when Carl Lambert, 
president of Action, announced that 98% of the members who voted rejected the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the vote was no surprise. Members had greeted everyone at the 
door when the meeting started with handouts titled "Here's Why We Are Opposed 
to the Inclusionary Housing Program." 
</P>
<P>
Heading the list of reasons was that the program would give the Rent Control 
Board "the opportunity to once again mislead . . . legislators and the public 
into believing they are doing something significant for the low and very low 
income tenants." 
</P>
<P>
K. B. Huff, an Action board member, told the crowd that he opposed the program 
because it would benefit only a small number of landlords who own large 
apartment buildings. Some landlords say turnover is too slow in most smaller 
apartment buildings to make the program economically attractive. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of us are going to get shafted," Huff said. "I don't like it a 
damn bit. If you think rent control has been bad for the last 10 years, you can 
expect it to get worse in the next 10 years with this program." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Taken Seriously 
</P>
<P>
Joel Goldfarb, another board member, said that although Action board members 
encouraged Lambert and James Baker to continue their discussions with Rent 
Control Board Commissioner Wayne Bauer, "I hope they understand that we never 
took the program seriously." 
</P>
<P>
"Not only do we think this program is silly, but we are not going to be 
dissuaded from converting our units into condos under Ellis," Goldfarb said to 
thunderous applause. 
</P>
<P>
Goldfarb was referring to state Ellis Act, written by former state Sen. Jim 
Ellis (R-El Cajon) and passed in 1985. It allows landlords to evict tenants and 
go out of the rental business if they can't turn a fair profit. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords interpret the Ellis Act to mean that they have broad rights to 
convert their buildings to other uses, such as condominiums. The Rent Control 
Board takes a far more restrictive view, and the law is being challenged in 
several court cases. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan will be used effectively (by the Rent Control Board) in court 
arguments to get court relief," contended Wes Wellman, former president of 
Action. "I think this is a propaganda device. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rent Control Board believes you are whores, that you are for sale," 
Wellman said. "The question is not whether the program is good or not, but is 
our value for sale? Is your vote for a little more cash flow or for your sacred 
honor." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Primary Goal Unchanged 
</P>
<P>
Baker said that he intends to participate in the program if it is implemented 
in September but that his primary goal of getting rid of rent control has not 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
"We should seize every opportunity to allow owners to survive while seeking to 
achieve our primary goal of getting rid of rent control," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Baker said he still expects about 50 landlords to 
participate in the program during the first year. 
</P>
<P>
"I told Wayne that during the discussions, and I still believe there will be 
about 50 people participating," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
The program was tentatively approved by the Rent Control Board in June. 
Landlords who join agree to participate for 10 years, with a one-time 
opportunity to leave the program after two years. 
</P>
<P>
Under the program, for each unit set aside for a qualified poor tenant at 
reduced rent, a landlord can raise the rent of a second unit by $400 to $900 
per month. The amount of increase permitted on the second unit depends on the 
size of the unit and whether the first unit was set aside for a "low-income" or 
"very low-income" tenant. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the overwhelming rejection of the program, Bauer said he is not 
discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rejection Anticipated 
</P>
<P>
"I anticipated it," Bauer said in a telephone interview. "Historically, there 
has been so much distrust that it makes perfect sense that people would oppose 
the program. It just indicates that trust has to be developed. Ten years of war 
is not going to disappear overnight." 
</P>
<P>
Susan Packer Davis, chairwoman of the rent board, said she was shocked by the 
overwhelming rejection. 
</P>
<P>
"That's too bad," she said. "I hope that is not indicative of landlords in 
general in Santa Monica. They may just be gun-shy. They don't trust the rent 
board. Anything we touch they don't have confidence in." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Bauer and Davis agree that even if 50 landlords participate at first, 
they will consider the program successful. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could get (50), that would be a real good start," Bauer said. "I want 
the landlords to feel as comfortable as possible." 
</P>
<P>
"Anything is better than one," said Davis, referring to the number of landlords 
who participated in an earlier attempt at an inclusionary housing program. "If 
we could get 50 landlords, that's something."

PENTAGON BANS NORTHROP UNIT FROM CONTRACTS; 
</P>
<P>
FIRM CALLS FRAUD CHARGES AGAINST PRECISION PRODUCTS DIVISION 'UNWARRANTED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Northrop division that was charged with criminal fraud last April, along with 
two of its top executives, has been suspended by the Air Force from obtaining 
new government contracts for an indefinite period. 
</P>
<P>
The Northrop precision products division in Norwood, Mass., which builds 
guidance equipment and gyroscopes, was notified of its suspension Monday by 
Daniel Rak, deputy assistant Air Force secretary for acquisition, management 
and policy. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop said in a statement Wednesday that "the charges are unwarranted and 
exaggerated and the suspension unnecessary." The company also said it will 
"provide information in opposition" to the suspension and begin discussions 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The suspension was not unexpected by Northrop, since the Pentagon has acted in 
recent cases to suspend contractors upon criminal indictment rather than 
conviction as was the case in the past. 
</P>
<P>
So far, such suspensions against major prime contractors have lasted only a 
matter of months. But a letter of notification by Rak said the suspension 
against Northrop would remain in force pending the completion of the legal 
proceedings against the company, a condition that puts Northrop in a 
potentially awkward position. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Took Strong Actions 
</P>
<P>
"It is clearly something that puts extreme pressure on Northrop," said Wolfgang 
Demisch, an analyst at UBS Securities in New York. "It sounds like the 
Department of Defense is using its position as a customer more forcefully than 
it has to date." 
</P>
<P>
Northrop said it has already taken strong actions to correct the problems at 
the Pomona facility where the fraud allegedly occurred. It permanently closed 
the facility and fired the plant manager and several employees. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop was indicted by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles on April 12 on 167 
counts of fraud and conspiracy for allegedly falsifying tests on guidance 
components for nuclear armed cruise missiles. The indictment was modified last 
month to include 22 additional fraud counts. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the general manager of the precision products division, Joseph 
Yamron, and Vice President Leopold Engler were indicted on charges that they 
knowingly supplied defective gyroscopes to the Air Force. The two executives 
have been put on suspension. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop says the charges "are unwarranted, and the company strongly disputes 
any allegations of criminal behavior by the division or by current employees." 
Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio said in April that the company would stand 
behind Yamron and Engler. 
</P>
<P>
The precision products division employs about 1,900 workers and accounts for 
$145 million in annual sales, or 2.5% of Northrop's total revenue. 
</P>
<P>
Although the division is only a small part of Northrop's business, the 
suspension comes at a politically inopportune time when Northrop is facing a 
major budget battle in Congress over its $70-billion B-2 bomber program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Needs Good Will 
</P>
<P>
"Defense contractors live off the good will of the body politic and to the 
extent that you are indicted or suspended, then you are more vulnerable in the 
halls of government," Demisch said. 
</P>
<P>
But Cantafio said, "This has nothing to do with the B-2." 
</P>
<P>
An Air Force spokesman confirmed that Northrop was suspended and that the 
service had planned to announce the suspension today. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Rak said the suspension against the firm was based on the 
indictment that alleged Northrop and its employees "conspired to defraud the 
government by knowingly supplying untested and out-of-specification flight 
stabilization and control packages and making false, fictitious and fraudulent 
statements and representations" relating to the guidance equipment for a cruise 
missile and stabilization equipment for the Harrier jet.

THE TIME INC. BATTLE; 
</P>
<P>
PARAMOUNT SCORES TIME'S EXECUTIVES IN COURT FILINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Paramount Communications Inc., hoping to stop Time Inc. and Warner 
Communications Inc. short of the altar, made a number of harsh allegations in 
its written pleadings to a Delaware judge this week, including the suggestion 
that Time's managers were prepared to adjust the company's price to advance 
their own careers. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of pages of documents became available this week in Paramount's 
challenge to Time's anti-takeover maneuvers. Paramount's $200-per-share offer 
has been rebuffed by Time because Time's directors maintain that the company 
isn't for sale. Instead, Time prefers to press ahead with an acquisition of 
Warner. 
</P>
<P>
A ruling in the case is expected by Friday, but until then, other lawyers, 
investors and reporters are searching for clues in the massive court filings. 
</P>
<P>
In a real "page turner" of a brief, Paramount's lawyers presented their version 
of Time's recent corporate history, in which they claim Time's top executives 
were preoccupied with fending off takeovers and preserving their own jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Using excerpts from memos and depositions, Paramount recounted how Time's chief 
strategist and general counsel, Gerald M. Levin, was charged with the task in 
1987 of finding companies to acquire. If Time became larger, the reasoning 
went, it would improve its chances of remaining independent. 
</P>
<P>
On Aug. 11, 1987, Levin sent a confidential memo to Time Chairman J. Richard 
Munro and president Nicholas J. Nicholas Jr., recommending that the company set 
a long-term goal of combining with Warner and Turner Broadcasting System. (Time 
has since secured an important ownership stake in Turner.) 
</P>
<P>
With some irony, the Paramount legal team noted that Levin "concluded that if a 
union with Warner was not possible, Time should explore a combination with 
Paramount." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Retirement an Issue 
</P>
<P>
But talks did proceed with Warner in 1987, initially centering on a joint 
venture in cable, programming and films. By the summer of 1988, the focus 
shifted to a complete merger. Prior to a July 8, 1988, meeting between Munro 
and Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross, Levin "ranked as a top priority" the 
establishment of shared power between the two men, and the succession of 
Nicholas as co-chief executive once Munro retired, the Paramount brief said. 
</P>
<P>
"Levin noted that although the exchange ratio for an exchange of Time and 
Warner shares should be based on market values, 'We should be flexible' if Ross 
agreed to share power and retire soon," according to the Paramount account. 
</P>
<P>
Time's legal filings contained no direct response to this one point, but Levin 
was willing to respond in general terms Wednesday. "When you have an 
acquisition, there normally is a premium paid," Levin said, adding: "We wanted 
Time Inc. to be the ultimate survivor." 
</P>
<P>
In August, 1988, negotiations broke off, largely because "Ross refused to 
promise to retire within five years after the merger," the Paramount brief 
said. When talks began anew in January, the negotiating teams' first issue was 
the matter of succession and the executives' contracts. (Ross agreed to give up 
the co-chief executive's job after five years but would continue as chairman 
for another five.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stock Swap Abandoned 
</P>
<P>
Ross and Time's three top executives each received 10-year contracts. 
</P>
<P>
In their brief, Paramount's attorneys strove hard to create the impression that 
Time was out-negotiated when it agreed to swap 0.465 of a Time share for each 
share of Warner. 
</P>
<P>
The 0.465 ratio "was far more than Warner expected to get," Paramount lawyers 
said. "In fact, Warner's financial advisors advised Warner that anything over 
.40 was fair and anything over .45 would be 'a hell of a deal.' " 
</P>
<P>
(After Paramount made its cash offer, Time abandoned the stock-swap plan, which 
required shareholder approval. Instead, it decided to make its own cash tender 
offer for Warner -- a move not subject to a shareholder vote.) 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, Paramount claimed that Nicholas, Time's president, 
"negotiated the final .465 exchange rate in one meeting. He did not have his 
investment advisor present." 
</P>
<P>
Levin responded: "The exchange ratio was arrived at through a process of 
intense negotiation designed to compensate Warner for the value of the assets 
that were being acquired . . . and (Nicholas) wasn't alone."

U.S. AGENCY EASES RULES TO EXPEDITE, CUT COSTS OF REFINANCED HOME LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Federal National Mortgage Assn., the nation's largest buyer of mortgages, 
announced new requirements Wednesday that should make it faster and cheaper for 
homeowners to refinance home loans. 
</P>
<P>
The new rules, expected to become industry standards for refinanced fixed-rate 
loans, will allow many homeowners to avoid having to get new appraisals or 
employment and income verifications, thereby shaving as much as one or two 
weeks and hundreds of dollars from the refinancing process. 
</P>
<P>
The rules are expected to appeal particularly to homeowners refinancing 
adjustable-rate mortgages into fixed-rate mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
The association, a government chartered shareholder-owned agency better known 
as Fannie Mae, buys billions of dollars worth of mortgages from lenders, and 
thus its move will have great influence on lending standards nationwide. Many 
larger lenders already have streamlined refinancing procedures, but the Fannie 
Mae action could prompt many more to adopt similar practices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Step in Right Direction' 
</P>
<P>
The moves by Fannie Mae come amid growing evidence of a new surge in 
refinancing demand as many fixed-rate mortgages are now available at below 10%. 
Fannie Mae economist David W. Berson said refinancings should account for 25% 
to 35% of conventional mortgage lending this summer. 
</P>
<P>
The actions taken are designed in part to avoid a crunch in processing of 
refinancing applications similar to that of 1986 and 1987. Then, a surge in 
refinancings, along with increased applications for original-purchase 
mortgages, resulted in some homeowners waiting as long as four to five months 
to complete refinancing requests. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it's a good idea," said Brian Chappelle, a vice president of the 
Mortgage Bankers Assn., whose members process thousands of refinancing requests 
nationwide. "It's not a panacea, but it's a step in the right direction. It 
gives lenders the ability to process refinancings more quickly and gives more 
time to process new-purchase loans." 
</P>
<P>
Chappelle noted that the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., also known as 
Freddie Mac, has a similar program to streamline refinancing requests. 
</P>
<P>
Major features of Fannie Mae's program, effective immediately, include: 
</P>
<P>
* Waiving the need for a new appraisal. Appraisals can cost as much as $500 or 
more. Waiving the requirement can happen if the refinancing is obtained from 
the current loan servicer and the lender warrants that the home's appraised 
value has not depreciated. However, a new appraisal will be needed under any 
circumstances if the current loan is backed by either the Federal Housing 
Administration or the Veterans Administration. 
</P>
<P>
* Waiving the need to requalify for the refinanced loan. This means the 
borrower doesn't need to have his or her credit history, employment and other 
background investigated to determine if he or she can afford the loan. 
</P>
<P>
This can happen if five conditions are met: The refinancing is obtained from 
the lender with the original loan file; the original mortgage met Fannie Mae 
standards for credit-worthiness; the borrower's income has not declined since 
he or she qualified for the original loan; the borrower has a satisfactory 
payment record, and the monthly payment on the refinanced loan is no more than 
15% greater than the payment at which the borrower was initially qualified. 
</P>
<P>
* Reducing the requirements for income, employment and credit verifications. 
For example, if the loan amount is less than 75% of the value of the home, no 
new income verification is needed. In other situations, a current pay stub may 
be sufficient to show income and employment. 
</P>
<P>
Not all Californians, however, will qualify for the streamlined procedures. To 
qualify, loans involved must be fixed-rate loans whose balances don't exceed 
$187,600, Fannie Mae's limit for loans it purchases on the secondary market. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, that knocks out some areas of California," where average home 
prices exceed those limits, Fannie Mae spokesman Gene Eisman said. 
</P>
<P>
Also to qualify, loans must not exceed 90% of the home's value, or 95% with 
mortgage insurance. For second homes, loans must not exceed 70% of the home's 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Borrowers must also not seek to take out cash through their refinancings. 
Borrowers can take out no more than 1% of the refinanced loan amount in cash. 
</P>
<P>
However, loans eligible under the new rules can include those allowing 
borrowers to wrap closing costs into the loan amounts rather than paying them 
in up-front cash. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Fannie Mae reported Wednesday that its net income for the second 
quarter of 1989 totaled $193 million, up 60% over the $120.7 million of the 
year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For the first six months of 1989, Fannie Mae's net income totaled $358.2 
million, up 62% over $221.6 million for the same period in 1988.

BUGS BUNNY AT 50; 
</P>
<P>
WARNER HOPES TO TOP THE LICENSING FEES THAT IT GOT FROM 'BATMAN.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bugs Bunny is about to give Batman a run for the money. 
</P>
<P>
No, there is no Bugs Bunny motion picture in the works. But Warner Bros. 
executives say that movie or not, plenty is up, Doc. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the licensing division of Warner Bros. -- the brains behind the 
current Batman merchandising mania -- will begin a yearlong 50th birthday bash 
for the Wascally Wabbit. 
</P>
<P>
Harebrained? Well, Warner officials quietly hope that sales of commemorative 
Bugs Bunny merchandise could equal -- or even surpass -- the many millions of 
dollars that Batman collectibles continue to pour into retail coffers. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 100 licensees will create everything from specially made car mats 
to thermal underwear embossed with the "Happy 50th Birthday Bugs" logo. Many of 
these companies are already Looney Tunes licensees, including one that makes -- 
with no apologies to Mickey Mouse -- a Bugs Bunny watch. 
</P>
<P>
"When we think of the family jewels at Warner Bros., we first think of Bugs 
Bunny," said Dan Romanelli, president of worldwide marketing at Warner Bros., 
and also president of Warner's licensing division, LCA Entertainment. "He's our 
most important star." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Mel Blanc, the voice of Bugs Bunny, died at age 81. Blanc, 
of course, was a centerpiece to the planned celebration. Blanc's son, Noel, who 
has been a longtime understudy to his father, will attend scheduled 
festivities, including a Hollywood party and parade. But there are still some 
unexpected kinks. 
</P>
<P>
The father and son recently filmed a yet-to-be-aired TV commercial for 
Oldsmobile. It was scheduled to be part of the familiar "This is not your 
father's Oldsmobile," ad campaign. The ad has Mel and Noel riding in an 
Oldsmobile along with several of Warner Bros.' animated characters whose voices 
Mel created -- including Bugs Bunny. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Blanc family gave Oldsmobile permission to go ahead with 
plans to air the commercial this fall. But Oldsmobile officials gathered in 
Detroit with Leo Burnett ad agency executives Wednesday to discuss whether the 
ad should be re-shot -- or at least re-edited. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros. executives are trying to come to grips with a situation none 
anticipated two years ago when planning began for the Bugs bash. "We're all 
deeply saddened," said Romanelli. "He was to be a part of all the festivities." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Warner officials hope that some of the wounds will heal before 
Thanksgiving Day, when the promotional campaign is scheduled to kick off with a 
six-story, $300,000 Bugs Bunny balloon in the Macy's parade in New York City. 
Throughout 1990, classic Bugs Bunny cartoons will be shown before many Warner 
Bros. feature films. And the Bugs Bunny 50th Birthday logo will appear next 
year on everything from home videos to records and cassette tapes sold by 
Warner. 
</P>
<P>
But Warner isn't the only company with millions of dollars riding on Bugs. Six 
Flags Corp., which owns and operates theme parks nationwide, has signed on as a 
corporate sponsor, and so has the giant candy maker Brock's. Promotional 
tie-ins are also being negotiated with major soft drink and snack food 
companies. And retail chains ranging from Macy's to Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 
have already committed to selling gobs of the commemorative merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
"This has not been a tough sell," said Romanelli. "Everyone knows Bugs." 
</P>
<P>
Do they ever. In a recent national study, when people were asked to name their 
favorite cartoon and comic book characters, Bugs Bunny ranked second only to 
Mickey Mouse, said Steven Levitt, president of the Port Washington, N.Y., 
research firm, Marketing Evaluation. In fact, Bugs was ranked dead even with 
Snoopy -- and placed slightly higher than Garfield. 
</P>
<P>
"There'll be a lot of money pumped into Bugs," said Levitt, "but I don't think 
it will be anything like what they're ramming down people's throats with 
Batman." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
People Know Bugs 
</P>
<P>
Then, again, maybe they won't have to. Bugs Bunny is not only the 
longest-running Saturday morning children's program in TV history, but, 
remarkably, it is also rated the No. 1 kids show on Saturday mornings, 
according to Nielsen Television Index. "A hell of a lot of people know who Bugs 
Bunny is," said Gary Frazier, associate professor of marketing at USC. "If a 
lot of money is put behind him, regardless of the occasion, it will almost 
certainly be successful." 
</P>
<P>
At the same, however, Frazier said that without some sort of splashy movie 
behind Bugs Bunny, the event will probably not have the impact of the current 
Batmania. "Without a movie to heighten the enthusiasm to buy the products," he 
said, "there is a potential danger." 
</P>
<P>
But Mickey Mouse didn't have a new movie last year, and his 60th birthday 
celebration was a big moneymaker. Some executives are even wondering if Bugs 
Bunny's 50th birthday could have the kind of financial impact for Warner that 
Mickey's had for Disney last year. According to some estimates -- which Disney 
would not confirm -- last year's Mickey Mouse festivities resulted in nearly 
$100 million in additional sales of Mickey Mouse merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
"It was successful beyond our greatest expectations," said Steve McBeth, senior 
vice president of consumer products at Walt Disney Co. He said Disney had more 
than 200 licensees that made commemorative merchandise for Mickey's 60th. But 
McBeth declined to comment on Warner's plans for Bugs Bunny, other than to say, 
"We wish them well." 
</P>
<P>
The business of cashing in on the birthdays of cartoon and comic strip 
characters seems to have picked up steam in recent years. The Batman movie 
coincided with the 50th anniversary of that comic book character. And it cost 
King Features Syndicate a lot of spinach to throw Popeye a huge 60th birthday 
party at F.A.O. Schwarz toy store in Manhattan last year. And when the Barbie 
doll turned 30 recently, toy maker Mattel wasted no time in coming up with a 
new "Superstar Barbie" doll, which comes decked in a pink ball gown. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, some companies really stretch these birthday celebrations. For 
example, the Laurel and Hardy comedy team formed 61 years ago. But Larry Harmon 
Pictures Corp. has already announced plans for next year's "Laurel and Hardy's 
100th Birthday Celebration." How did they figure that? Well, it seems that Stan 
Laurel -- not the comedy team -- was born in 1890. 
</P>
<P>
"What can I say?" said Jerry Bigney, vice president of marketing at Larry 
Harmon Pictures. "If I had to wait for the 100th birthday of the team, that 
would be another 39 years. And who has that much time to spare?"

Soviets Seek Ads in Space: The Soviet Union has retained the world's largest 
advertising agency, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, to help sell broadcast rights and 
corporate sponsorships for the first Soviet-British space mission, according to 
a report in today's New York Times. The program would allow such things as 
commercials promoting a particular brand of sneaker as the official athletic 
footwear of the space project. Art Dula, president of the Space Commerce Corp. 
of Houston, which has U.S. marketing rights for the venture, said advertisers 
also would be able to put their firm's name on a Soviet space craft. The 1991 
mission, which will carry Britain's first astronaut into orbit from a launching 
pad in the Soviet Union, will be financed entirely by the sale of commercial 
opportunities, the newspaper said.

INVESTORS FEAR REGULATORY PROBE BECAUSE DEAL INVOLVES JUNK BONDS; 
</P>
<P>
BAT STOCK FALLS IN WAKE OF HUGE BUYOUT BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shares of BAT Industries PLC slipped Wednesday on talk that the massive 
$21-billion buyout of the company proposed by Sir James Goldsmith is being 
financed by junk bonds and may spark opposition from regulators. 
</P>
<P>
BAT stock closed off 37 cents (23 pence) at $14.18 (8.70 pounds) per share on 
the London Stock Exchange. In New York, U.S.-traded shares closed 25 cents 
lower at $14.125. Volume was heavy in both markets. 
</P>
<P>
The selloff came on fears that British regulatory authorities might launch an 
investigation into Europe's largest-ever takeover offer because the bid was 
cashless, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
They also said many British investors, conservative by nature, would resist the 
bid because it offers loan notes, or junk bonds, that will be repaid by carving 
up and selling pieces of the huge BAT conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
Others said the price was too low. 
</P>
<P>
"If this were put out in the U.S., it would go very well. Over here there's a 
culture clash, the (London) market is not comfortable with debt," said Anton 
Simon, a high-yield portfolio manager at National Commercial Bank of Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chance of Investigation 
</P>
<P>
A London bond dealer added: "Holders of BAT shares are unlikely to sell because 
there is no cash content. They won't want junk paper." 
</P>
<P>
Junk bonds are high-yield, high-risk securities that have become popular in 
financing takeovers in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts and bankers said there was a growing chance the bid would be referred 
for investigation to the British Monopolies and Mergers Commission or that the 
Bank of England could step in because of the offer's leveraged nature. 
</P>
<P>
BAT, Britain's third-biggest company, quickly rejected the takeover bid when it 
was announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In its first strategic move after rejecting the offer, BAT said Wednesday that 
it appointed investment bankers Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and Shearson Lehman 
Hutton Inc. as its U.S. advisers. 
</P>
<P>
BAT may look to American courts and insurance authorities to block the bid, 
analysts and legal experts said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldsmith, who is working with two partners, has pledged to break up the 
conglomerate and sell off its non-tobacco interests, starting with the U.S. 
insurance company Farmers Group Inc., which BAT won after a bitter takeover 
fight last year. 
</P>
<P>
But BAT's suitors could get held up by regulatory issues that delayed its 
purchase of Farmers. 
</P>
<P>
"Our law requires that, no matter what, before any change in control of a 
domestic insurance company, there must be a review," said Lorraine Johnson, 
senior staff counsel to the California Department of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
While most reviews take 60 days, BAT and Farmers battled it out for almost nine 
months, Johnson noted. Goldsmith and BAT could easily wage a war of that 
length, she added. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Takeover Wave Feared 
</P>
<P>
Hoylake Investments, the takeover vehicle controlled by Goldsmith, Australian 
businessman Kerry Packer and Jacob Rothschild, a member of the famous banking 
family, has valued BAT shares at $13.86 each. 
</P>
<P>
The offer marks the first time that aggressive finance and break-up strategies 
pioneered on Wall Street have been used by corporate raiders in the London 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians and business leaders expressed fears that the tactic would start a 
wave of takeover bids for giant companies in Britain and on the Continent.

Chiat/Day Completes Acquisition: Los Angeles-based Chiat/Day advertising agency 
completed its acquisition of the Mojo MDA Group of Australia for about $66 
million. Chiat/Day/Mojo, which will have billings in excess of $1 billion, said 
about 20 people in Mojo's San Francisco office have lost their jobs as a result 
of the merger. Many of the layoffs were triggered after Mojo lost its 
$10-million ad business for the Toyota Dealers of Northern California because 
of a conflict with Chiat's giant Nissan account.

FUTURES LET SPECULATORS TAKE THE RISKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Commodities exchanges give speculators the opportunity to bet millions of 
dollars on the future prices of such goods as soybeans, gold, Treasury bills 
and frozen orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the futures exchanges is to transfer the risk of price 
fluctuations from people who don't want the risk -- such as farmers or metals 
processors -- to speculators who are willing to gamble on making big profits. 
</P>
<P>
Futures contracts are agreements to deliver a quantity of goods at a specified 
price at a certain time in the future. Options, which also are widely traded on 
the exchanges, give purchasers the right but not the obligation to buy or sell 
something at a certain price within a specified period. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities traders, standing in recessed "pits" and dressed in brightly 
colored jackets, shout orders and flash hand signals to each other in a 
free-for-all auction of contracts. 
</P>
<P>
In a typical transaction on a commodities exchange, a farmer who wants to lock 
in a guaranteed price for his crop to minimize risk will promise to deliver 
20,000 bushels of soybeans at a specified future date at a specified price. 
</P>
<P>
Assuming the price rises, the speculator who buys the contract could later take 
the beans from the farmer and resell them to someone else at the higher market 
price, pocketing the profit. 
</P>
<P>
But if the price drops, the speculator would lose money by having to pay the 
farmer the agreed-upon price and then resell the soybeans at the lower market 
price. 
</P>
<P>
Speculators rarely end up actually holding mountains of tin or pork bellies 
because they sell their positions at a profit or loss before the delivery date. 
The ultimate buyer is a customer who actually needs the commodity. 
</P>
<P>
Although the exchanges began with agricultural products, they have rapidly 
expanded into financial products. For example, the Chicago Board of Trade does 
most of its business in contracts based on the value of the Standard &amp; 
Poor's 100-stock and 500-stock indexes. 
</P>
<P>
Other major exchanges include the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the New York 
Mercantile Exchange, the Commodity Exchange in New York, the New York Cotton 
Exchange and the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange.

N.Y. INVESTORS BUY HOLLYWOOD VIDEO BUSINESS; 
</P>
<P>
AME IS INDUSTRY'S BIGGEST POST-PRODUCTION HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group headed by New York investor Lawrence J. Berkowitz said Wednesday that 
it has agreed to buy AME Inc., a Burbank company that is Hollywood's largest 
videotape post-production house, for nearly $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
The Berkowitz group, through a company called AME Holding Co., will pay $57 
million for AME's 4.9 million shares and will assume about $42 million in AME 
debt that will be refinanced. 
</P>
<P>
Berkowitz emerged as a suitor for AME after Andrew M. McIntyre, AME's founder 
and chief executive, dropped a $37-million bid in February to buy the 56% of 
AME he did not already own. McIntyre cited his inability to finance the offer 
on terms he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
The Berkowitz group will buy AME's stock in two parts. McIntyre's 44% stake is 
to be bought for $10 a share, or $22 million, under an option McIntyre granted 
the group in April. The remaining shares are to be bought for $12.50 a share, 
or nearly $35 million. AME's stock closed Wednesday at $11.50 a share in 
over-the-counter trading, up $1. 
</P>
<P>
First National Bank of Boston, Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd. and members of 
the investor group will provide financing for the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Berkowitz said he will serve as chairman and chief executive of AME but added 
that he plans to regularly consult McIntyre. Berkowitz added that two former 
AME executives who resigned this year, president and chief operating officer 
Larry Kingen and chief financial officer Martin Katz, have agreed to rejoin the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Berkowitz, 48, is the former chief executive of IDC Services, a company 
specializing in payroll and casting services for the entertainment and 
advertising businesses. He left IDC in early 1988 after the company was sold 
and has been a private investor and consultant in New York since then. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre started AME in 1980 and quickly built it into one of the major 
providers of videotape services in the entertainment business, performing such 
tasks as transferring movies and television shows from film to videotape. It is 
uncertain what McIntyre plans to do; he could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
In the year ended last Sept. 30, AME earned $3.2 million on revenue of $47.6 
million.

McCaw-Lin Talks Under Way: McCaw Cellular Communications said discussions are 
continuing on the possible acquisition of Lin Broadcasting at a price higher 
than its current bid of $110 a share. The Kirkland, Wash.-based cellular 
telephone company, which originally bid $120 a share for Lin before a court 
killed Lin's efforts to acquire certain valuable cellular interests, said it 
has discussed other matters with New York-based Lin. Talks included the 
possibility of acquiring certain Lin cellular interests or acquiring Lin at a 
reduced price after the proposed spinoff of Lin's seven broadcast stations, 
McCaw said.

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: ON-LINE SERVICES LEAPING FORWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lawrence J. Magid., LAWRENCE J. MAGID is a Silicon Valley-based computer 
analyst and writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten years ago, two companies set out to create an industry. In 1979, CompuServe 
and the Source launched competing electronic information services for personal 
computer owners. 
</P>
<P>
Subscribers to either service who hooked their computers up to a telephone line 
could, among other things, send and receive electronic mail. Over the years, 
both services added features such as access to home shopping, electronic 
"bulletin boards," up-to-the-minute news, travel information, encyclopedias and 
much more. 
</P>
<P>
I was once a regular user of the Source, but I stopped using it a few years ago 
when I noticed that CompuServe offered more features for about the same price. 
I wasn't alone. The Source, which was once owned by Reader's Digest, reportedly 
peaked at about 80,000 subscribers in 1985 and sank to about 50,000 users by 
the end of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
CompuServe, however, has grown steadily. The company claims to have more than 
500,000 subscribers. And it is about to add thousands more by virtue of its 
agreement announced June 29 to acquire the Source for an undisclosed amount. 
The company plans to shut down the Source in August and issue a free CompuServe 
password and a $20 credit to each current subscriber. 
</P>
<P>
Normally, I would mourn the death of an industry pioneer and lament what might 
seem like bad news for consumers. But the "on-line" industry has heated up 
lately and CompuServe faces other competitors that are far more innovative and 
aggressive than its former rival. 
</P>
<P>
Competition between services was once based on the number of features, or 
information services, available. But companies are also competing on ease of 
use and cost. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Change in Communication 
</P>
<P>
When you're connected to a traditional on-line service, your PC essentially 
works as a dumb terminal talking to a giant mainframe. The Source and 
CompuServe subscribers, in general, communicate with the mainframe directly, 
issuing commands in response to on-screen instructions or "menus." Both systems 
are easier to use than many academic and corporate mainframes, but neither is 
as easy to use as the best of today's personal computer programs. That, 
however, is changing. 
</P>
<P>
CompuServe is working on a new program, called the CompuServe Information 
Manager, that will revolutionize the way people use the service. A version for 
IBM PC and compatible computers will be released this fall followed by a 
Macintosh version early next year. 
</P>
<P>
After experimenting with an advance copy of the software, I am convinced that 
the service will not only be easier to use but also more economical. Instead of 
responding to prompts from the mainframe, the user issues commands by selecting 
them from pull-down menus at the top of the PC screen. 
</P>
<P>
Users can also save money by doing some of their work before connecting to the 
service. Electronic mail, for example, can be composed and read "off-line" so 
that you don't have to pay the hourly fee while you are reading or typing. 
</P>
<P>
The program that will run on your PC or Macintosh is designed to work directly 
with the software that runs on the service's mainframes. As a result, the 
personal computer is more than a terminal. It's actually a peer in the 
communications loop, which makes the service easy to use. 
</P>
<P>
CompuServe requires a $39 start-up kit and costs $12.50 an hour for the basic 
service. There are surcharges for some of its databases. 
</P>
<P>
CompuServe's new software follows a trend that was started by several of the 
company's competitors. Prodigy, MacNet and PC-Link already came with software 
designed to make them easy to use. 
</P>
<P>
Prodigy's software, for example, completely takes over your PC, presenting the 
user with graphics, extra large type and easy-to-remember commands. The service 
has been criticized, however, because its software does not allow users to save 
information on their hard disk or transfer information from their PC's disk to 
the service's electronic mail. All messages must be typed in at the keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
Prodigy offers travel information, headline news and access to "experts" in 
such areas as fitness (Jane Fonda), movies (Gene Siskel), personal finance 
(Sylvia Porter) and computers (Stewart Alsop and yours truly. I write three 
on-line columns each week.) The experts no longer provide personal responses 
via the system's electronic mail service but do answer public messages posted 
on bulletin boards. 
</P>
<P>
A Prodigy start-up kit costs $49 and includes three months of free use. 
Subsequent use is billed at $10 a month, with no charge for on-line time. 
Prodigy draws additional revenue by displaying advertisements at the bottom of 
the screen and by allowing merchants to sell products and services on-line. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Innovative Approach 
</P>
<P>
MacNet from Connect Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., provides an extremely innovative 
approach to on-line information. The Macintosh version behaves exactly as 
regular Macintosh software does, even while you are connected with the 
mainframe. Data is displayed in multiple windows, and you can easily copy and 
paste information from the MacNet screen to any other Macintosh application. 
</P>
<P>
An IBM PC version called PC/MacNet runs under Microsoft's Windows operating 
environment and thus is very similar to the Mac version. 
</P>
<P>
MacNet is aimed at business and professional users and has no games or 
entertainment features. It does provide excellent electronic mail, as well as 
various news services. Reading news on MacNet is a joy. In addition to the 
latest news, the past two week's news stories are available in "folders" that 
are visible on the screen. You can access news from any day by using the mouse 
to click on its folder. You then get a list of headlines and can read a story 
by clicking the headline. 
</P>
<P>
Everything you do during a session remains on the screen, in a window, which 
can be viewed by selecting it from a special menu on the top of the screen. The 
service is so "Mac like" that it's easy to forget that you're on-line. 
</P>
<P>
MacNet and PC/MacNet require a $75 start-up kit that includes software and your 
account number. Usage costs $8 a hour during weekdays and $4 evenings and 
weekends. 
</P>
<P>
PC-Link, from Quantum Computer Services, offers news from USA Today along with 
business news, stock updates, travel, electronic mail, an encyclopedia, 
software library and all the usual on-line features. It uses Tandy's DeskMate 
interface which, like Microsoft Windows, works with a mouse and pull-down 
menus. 
</P>
<P>
It's extremely easy and pleasant to use with screens that are colorful and easy 
to read. The start-up kit, available at any Radio Shack store, costs $30. There 
is a $10 monthly fee, but there are no hourly fees for evening and weekend use. 
</P>
<P>
A premium service, called PC-Link Plus, costs 10 cents per minute. There is a 
15-cents-a-minute surcharge when using the service during the business day. It 
works with any IBM compatible PC and can be purchased at any Radio Shack store. 
Quantum offers similar services for the Commodore 64/128 and Apple II. A 
Macintosh version is in development.

ON-LINE SERVICES 
</P>
<P>
CompuServe 
</P>
<P>
Features: The nation's oldest and largest surviving on-line information

Press news reports, daily computer industry news updates, weather, home 
shopping and games. 
</P>

SPAIN PROBING DREXEL UNIT'S ROLE IN DEAL

Spanish securities regulators are investigating a unit of the U.S. brokerage 
firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. over allegations that it misrepresented itself 
in the stock sale of the petroleum giant Repsol SA, a report published 
Wednesday said. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper El Pais quoted unnamed sources from the National Securities 
Commission as alleging that last spring Drexel sold Repsol shares intended for 
small investors to a few large private institutions. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper's sources said Drexel requested an estimated $59.8 million in 
shares of the state-controlled Repsol to be sold to 400 investors. But they 
claimed that on May 11, the first day of public trading, Drexel improperly sold 
the shares to a small number of large private investors, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
There was no comment on the report at Drexel's Spanish office. 
</P>
<P>
However, Repsol issued a statement late Wednesday denying that Drexel formed 
part of the syndicate of 48 brokerages or investment firms that took part in 
the stock sale. 
</P>
<P>
"Drexel Burnham Lambert did not form part of the offering, thus, there has been 
no relation at all between that firm and Repsol," it said. "Repsol has 
cooperated since the start of the (commission's) investigation (in early June) 
and based on its outcome will then take the appropriate legal action." 
</P>
<P>
Between April 20 and May 6, Repsol, Europe's eighth-largest petroleum company, 
sold 79.75 million shares at $14.70 each to 400,000 shareholders worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
The company sold 44 million of the total shares offered to individual Spanish 
shareholders under a prorated system. 
</P>
<P>
El Pais said the sources confirmed that the commission had contacted at least 
10 of the 400 investors Drexel had identified as original buyers. They said 
they knew nothing about ordering the purchase of Repsol shares. 
</P>
<P>
El Pais said if Drexel used the names of investors without their consent, the 
brokerage could face criminal fraud charges.

'ONE BIG WOW'; 
</P>
<P>
97TH EDITION OF COUNTY FAIR OPENS ITS GATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The combination of squealing children, squawking barn animals and the 
delectable fast food struck the Orange County Fairgrounds Wednesday as this 
year's annual event opened. 
</P>
<P>
The smells of corn dogs mixing with barn odors from the 97-year-old fair 
brought back fond memories for the older crowd and created lasting impressions 
for the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one big wow," declared DeLoris Murphy, a stylishly dressed 65-year-old 
who carried an extra pair of comfortable walking shoes for, well, just in case. 
"This is the first time I got in with senior citizen admission, and I intend to 
take full advantage," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy, who was sporting a red, laced Stetson hat, predicted that she will 
cover every inch of the 160-acre fair. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm like a child again when I come to the fair," said Murphy, who raised sheep 
during her youth in Minnesota. "I know it might sound a little goofy, but you 
can be 65 years old here and still be a kid." 
</P>
<P>
Or you can be as young as 7-year-old John Hall and still be a fair veteran. 
John was found hopping along the Footsie Wootsies, coin-operated machines that 
claim to offer the best foot massage on the West Coast for 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been to about, say, five of these (fairs)," said John in the middle of a 
hop. "The worst time is when I got lost and Dad was going crazy." 
</P>
<P>
His father, Ed, operator of the Golden Eagle booth, said his son remembers all 
the fair details that he can't because he is generally too busy keeping an eye 
on his son and selling pretzels and popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
Fair attendance was moderate, which is normal for a Wednesday opening day, 
according to spokeswoman Jill A. Lloyd. The fair opened at noon and by 3, the 
tally was 5,734. The number is slightly higher than last year, when 5,667 
people had walked through the turnstiles in the first three hours. 
</P>
<P>
This year's fair, which will last for 12 days, is called "Stop &amp; Smell the 
Flowers," and is dedicated to small animals and plants. 
</P>
<P>
Although the fair contained hundreds of booths ranging from watercolor tattoos 
to barbecue-beef eateries, it was the animals that provided the special county 
fair ambiance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pepper the Friendly Rat 
</P>
<P>
The American Fancy Rat and Mouse Assn. had its own booth to show off several 
breeds of rats and mice, including 11-month-old-Pepper, a friendly rat. 
</P>
<P>
"Rats are very intelligent and much better than your average hamster," Karen 
Hauser, the association's founder, insisted. "When people think of rats, they 
think of sewers and things like that. That's not true. They can be trained and 
even know their own names." 
</P>
<P>
But rats are too small to shear. Rachel Johnson, 16, prefers sheep. Rachel has 
been showing sheep for nine years at various fairs, including this one. 
</P>
<P>
"Fairs are sometimes a little tiring," Rachel said, as she fluffed and dried 
her 5-month-old Southdown with a hefty hair dryer. "But it's worth the time and 
the effort." 
</P>
<P>
For newcomers to the fair, one of its draws was the size. 
</P>
<P>
Heather Goudie, 19, who was visiting from Nebraska, was awed. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any huge carnival rides like they do here," she said. "We only 
have livestock and animals" 
</P>
<P>
Goudie came to the fair with her grandparents, who live in Garden Grove, and 
her parents. In fact, her father, Tom, used to show cattle when he was a 
student here at Rancho Alamitos High School. 
</P>
<P>
"All I remember were a few old barns and maybe a show arena for the animals. 
Now, it's huge," said Goudie, who is now a hog farmer. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Evelyn, 67, remembered the family attending every fair to watch as 
Tom's animals won ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kristen Seielstad, a cool 3-year-old with sunglasses, got to cuddle 
her first goat Wednesday -- a kid, not much bigger than she. 
</P>
<P>
Her grandparents, Audrey and Jerry Valenta, captured every moment of Kristen's 
first encounter with their video camera. "I brought my three kids down here 
when they were little. Now, it's our grandchildren's turn," Audrey Valenta 
said.

FAA BLAMES AGING CIRCUITS FOR COMPUTER BREAKDOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
Operations at the regional air traffic control center in El Toro were back to 
normal Wednesday, Federal Aviation Administration officials said, after a 
series of computer outages was traced to vital components more than a dozen 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
The FAA's explanation came after air traffic controllers told The Times on 
Tuesday that a new multimillion-dollar computer system installed 2 1/2 months 
ago had failed 104 times on Sunday, endangering air safety. 
</P>
<P>
But "no new computer system was involved," Jim Panter, manager of the Coast 
Terminal Radar Approach Control facility, said Wednesday. "It was strictly old 
equipment that needed to be replaced." 
</P>
<P>
The computer system at Coast TRACON has been in use at least since 1972, Panter 
said. New system software was installed 2 1/2 months ago on the existing 
computer's hardware, leaving it vulnerable to the type of breakdown that 
occurred Sunday, which officials blamed on brittle wires inside aging memory 
units. 
</P>
<P>
From about 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday, flight data repeatedly disappeared from 
video display screens used by air traffic controllers at Coast TRACON, 
sometimes for as long as five minutes, officials said. During the outages, 
radar still showed each plane's position, but the only way to know a plane's 
altitude, speed or identity was through voice communication with pilots. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't really that dangerous, because we still had the radar," Panter said. 
</P>
<P>
A special crew from the FAA's technical center in Atlantic City, N.J., worked 
on successive nights this week to solve the problem, but due to a parts 
shortage, some outages still occured Monday and Tuesday, Panter said. There 
were no outages Wednesday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
A heat buildup aggravated the situation on Sunday, Panter said, with the 
computer system shutting itself down and restarting several times as it tried 
on its own to locate the memory problem. 
</P>
<P>
Four of the Univac computer's 11 "memory modules" went out on Sunday because of 
cracked, broken wires, Panter added. 
</P>
<P>
"They've all been replaced now, so there shouldn't be any repeat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The recently installed software was not implicated in Sunday's failures, Panter 
said, but FAA officials said it has been involved in problems at other TRACON 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Just like any program, the new software has had its glitches," said FAA 
spokesman John Leyden in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the National Air Traffic Controllers Assn. in Washington said 
Wednesday that at least one NATCO chapter, at Dallas-Ft. Worth, has filed an 
"unsatisfactory condition" report with the FAA concerning computer problems at 
their control center. 
</P>
<P>
However, NATCO officials said they believe the Dallas-Ft. Worth problems are 
software-related and not similar to the hardware failures that plagued Coast 
TRACON on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas-Ft. Worth air traffic control officials could not be reached for 
comment.

SISTERS SOUGHT AFTER BOYFRIEND SUFFOCATES 
</P>

Arrest warrants have been issued for two sisters who, after an argument, 
allegedly tied up the 42-year-old live-in boyfriend of one of the women, 
wrapped his head in bed linen and left him in a closet where he died of 
suffocation, Santa Ana police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Stephanie Rene Vick, 28, and her sister, Sonya Lee Vick, 33, are being sought 
in connection with the death last month of Antonio Ariza, Santa Ana Police 
spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said. Investigators believe that the women may have 
fled to the Midwest, possibly to relatives. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said the two women allegedly overpowered Ariza, Stephanie Vick's 
boyfriend, after the couple had an argument in their house on June 9. 
</P>
<P>
They allegedly tied Ariza's limbs with television cable, wire and rope, and 
wrapped his head in bed linens, making him appear mummy-like, Thomas said. 
Ariza's body was discovered in the closet five days later by another sister, 
who called police. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said Ariza is believed to have been alive when Stephanie and Sonya Vick 
left the house in the 1700 block of West Richland Street. But authorities have 
not been able to determine the exact time and date Ariza suffocated. 
</P>
<P>
Ariza was a maintenance worker in Orange County. Thomas said she had no 
indication whether the two sisters were employed. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas said she did not have details of the argument between Ariza and 
Stephanie Vick and declined to release further information for fear of 
jeopardizing the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, one neighbor said he recalled hearing loud noises coming from the 
sisters' home on the night of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard them yelling or screaming," said Ruben Villasenor, who lives down the 
street from the faded yellow, single-story house. "It was about 2 to 3 o'clock 
in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
After a few days, Villasenor said, one of the children in the neighborhood 
"started smelling something funny. He told his mom and dad and they called the 
cops."

D.A. WILL LET JUDGE DECIDE IF BAKER VIOLATED SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK and STEVEN R. CHURM, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County prosecutors will let a judge decide if former Irvine City 
Councilman C. David Baker violated terms of his forgery sentence last fall when 
he accepted use of a 1989 Cadillac and negotiated a $120,000-a-year job while 
doing court-ordered community service for a local youth organization. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans announced Wednesday that he has 
completed a review of the Baker matter and has forwarded information to Orange 
County Superior Court Judge Myron S. Brown, who sentenced Baker last November. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, we believe we are not the appropriate agency to handle that matter 
at this time," Evans said. He added that the manner in which Baker performed 
his community service is better left between the former councilman and the 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
Evans declined to discuss how his office reviewed the matter, but said that he 
has sent a letter and some written material to Judge Brown. He declined to 
release copies, however, saying that he does not consider them to be public 
records because the matter will still be under review by the judge. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Brown did not return several telephone calls from The Times on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Baker's attorney, Paul S. Meyer of Costa Mesa, dismissed the matter as a 
controversy generated by an article -- based on "unsubstantiated rumors" -- in 
the Times Orange County Edition last month. 
</P>
<P>
"It was much to-do about nothing," Meyer said. He said prosecutors reviewed his 
client's community service and found nothing improper. 
</P>
<P>
Times Orange County Edition Editor Narda Zacchino said of the Baker article: 
"It was a legitimate story and we stand by it." 
</P>
<P>
Baker had been the early favorite last summer in the congressional race to 
replace retiring Rep. Robert E. Badham (R-Newport Beach). But in the closing 
days of the GOP primary his campaign ran short of cash. Baker, then executive 
director of the Irvine Health Foundation, made out a $48,000 check from that 
organization to himself and signed it with the forged signature of another 
foundation officer. That officer, David G. Sills, is also a Superior Court 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
Baker stopped payment on the check shortly thereafter, and the forgery was not 
discovered until after the June primary election, which Baker narrowly lost. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney ultimately charged Baker with a felony. Baker pleaded 
guilty and Judge Brown reduced the charge to a misdemeanor, sentencing him to a 
one-year jail term -- which was suspended -- plus a year of probation, on the 
condition that he perform 500 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
The Times reported that Sports Kids, a nonprofit organization founded by 
Olympian Bob Mathias, was withholding $80,000 owed to him because officials 
feared that payment might violate the terms of his sentencing. Baker, a 
36-year-old lawyer, performed a portion of his community service raising money 
and doing legal tasks for Sports Kids. 
</P>
<P>
Executive Director Chuck Foster also acknowledged that Baker had been given use 
of a Cadillac and had negotiated a full-time job, although Baker left the group 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
The article also reported that Baker and his father had loaned $20,000 to the 
Irvine-based organization at about the same time Baker was starting his 
community service. The $80,000 represents repayment of the loan, plus salary 
owed to Baker, Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
Evans was quoted in the story as saying that he intended to investigate the 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Evans said Wednesday that his office "evaluated the information from the Times, 
and information we received from (Baker's attorney, Paul) Meyer and others and 
concluded that it is a matter between Judge Brown and the probationer (Baker)."

A 26-year-old Fullerton man was missing from the Theo Lacy minimum-security 
jail facility during an early morning bed check, a Sheriff's Department 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Manuel S. Orosco, 26, was absent after a bed check revealed only his jail

<P>
Orosco, who was awaiting trial on a drug charge, is not considered dangerous,

<P>
VISA OKD FOR SISTER OF ACCIDENT VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A humanitarian visa has been approved for the Filipino sister of a Santa Ana 
mother of two small children who lost the use of her legs in an automobile 
accident last summer, according to Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
Dornan's Washington office said the congressman helped Elisa Solomon of the 
Philippines obtain the visa in order to help her sister, Estrella Still, care 
for her children following the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Dornan intervened with the Immigration and Naturalization Service in response 
to pleas from Still's elderly parents and the UCI Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Still, who is confined to a wheelchair, was forced to move into her parents' 
mobile home with her two children after the accident, Dornan's office said.

MAGADAN, Soviet Union 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After landing in this Soviet Far East outpost, an ocean away from home, 
11-year-old Tony Aliengena did not even have to look out his cockpit to see who 
was awaiting his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, there they were: scores of smiling young children clad in the 
trademark orange neckerchiefs symbolizing membership in the Young Pioneers, the 
Communist Party youth organization. 
</P>
<P>
Since entering the Soviet Union June 23, the San Juan Capistrano aviator and 
his entourage have been met every step of the way by the Young Pioneers. 
Leningrad, one of the first stops on Tony's itinerary, featured a tour of a 
so-called Pioneer Palace where children go to study and make handicrafts. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Tony was shuttled to the headquarters of Pioneer Pravda, a youth 
newspaper that circulates to about 11 million Pioneers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rallies at Each Stop 
</P>
<P>
And, in all but one of his nine stops since Moscow, Tony's hosts have whisked 
him out to one of the local Pioneer camps where children spend the summer. 
Sunday night in the eastern Siberian capital of Yakutsk, Tony and his family 
were given center-stage seats in the local Pioneer Palace for a children's 
production that included a play and a group of Bulgarian dancers. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneer children have been rallied out at each stop by local 
representatives of Komsomol, the youth arm of the Communist Party Central 
Committee. Komsomol has been in charge of all Soviet travel arrangements for 
Tony and his family. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tony has never seemed to tire of all the adulation by his 
Russian-speaking peers, the adults in his entourage have gotten to the point 
where they grimace at the mere mention of going to another Pioneer camp. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had it, no more Pioneer camps," Tony's father, Gary Aliengena, groaned 
after touring a hot, mosquito-infested camp in the woods outside Yakutsk. "We 
can't fly 10 hours a day and then do this." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Break From Camps 
</P>
<P>
Aleksie Grinevich, a Moscow journalist accompanying Tony on his trip, 
subsequently promised the Aliengena family a break from the Pioneer camp at 
Monday's stop in Okhotsk. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Pioneer camps in some ways are like Boy Scout and Girl Scout camps 
in America. Children go there for a few weeks each summer and spend their days 
making new friends and engaging in such activities as soccer, gymnastics, 
photography and puppet theater. But there is a crucial difference between the 
American and Soviet camps: at the Pioneer camps, children are subjected to 
Communist revolutionary propaganda at nearly every turn. 
</P>
<P>
Statues and busts of Vladimir Lenin, the country's revolutionary hero, adorn 
courtyards and entrances of camp dormitories. Huge murals of fighting soldiers 
provide the backdrop for slogans like this one found at a camp outside 
Kemerovo: "Pioneers! Be ready for the struggle of the ideas of the Communist 
Party of the Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
At a children's award ceremony outside Kemerovo, young Pioneers -- smartly 
dressed in white dress shirts, blue pants, skirts and pink and green caps -- 
marched to sounds of a bugle and drums. 
</P>
<P>
"The children are brainwashed in these camps," one Soviet resident said outside 
a camp in the closed city of Kuibyshev, where camp officials speaking through 
loud speakers issued militaristic commands. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a remnant of the Stalin era," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Strong Incentive 
</P>
<P>
Attendance at the camps is voluntary, but there is strong incentive for the 
children to participate. The camps, being almost wholely subsidized by the 
state, charge only a pittance to provide care for children during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
The Young Pioneers group was founded in 1923 following the country's four-year 
civil war to help relieve working parents of the responsibility of tending to 
their children during the summer, said Luydmila Nepomayashaya, director of the 
camp outside Yakutsk. Almost all women in the country, she noted, have 
full-time jobs. 
</P>
<P>
Membership in the Pioneers is open to children ages 7 to 14. After that age, 
they are eligible to become members of Komsomol, which also sponsors some 
summer camps. 
</P>
<P>
Although summer camp is the highlight of the year for Pioneers, the group 
offers year-round activities for children at the Pioneer Palaces, which are set 
up in most Soviet cities. 
</P>
<P>
At the palaces, which are open to non-Pioneer children as well, youngsters are 
encouraged to go every day after school to study and make dolls and other 
handiwork, said Faina Ardejeva, director of the Pioneer Palace in Yakutsk. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Place to Keep Busy 
</P>
<P>
Since Soviet children attend school only half a day, Ardejeva said, the Pioneer 
Palace provides a place for them to keep busy. 
</P>
<P>
"Just imagine if a child were at home the whole winter," she said. "It is a bad 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
The children seem to love the camp. 
</P>
<P>
When asked what she liked about the camp outside Yakutsk, Karina Gorbunova, 12, 
smiled widely and said, "Everything. The trees, the birds, the people. It is 
all beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the rigor of having to go to a different camp almost every night, Tony 
did not complain. 
</P>
<P>
Besides having flowers, pens and other gifts heaped upon him by the children, 
the camps held another attraction for Tony: the girls. 
</P>
<P>
Tony has become so mesmerized by the sight of so many girls fawning over him 
for autographs, that he judges each camp by the number of girls that most 
attracted him. 
</P>
<P>
"Omsk I liked. There were three girls I liked there," he said. "Kemerovo, there 
was one girl I liked there. At Kuibyshev I also liked a girl." 
</P>
<P>
Through he tired of the camps, Tony's father allowed that they were an integral 
part of Tony's around-the-world-trip, which is based on a friendship theme 
between children of the United States and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"The camps," he said, "are where the children are."

WILL A FAST START LAST IN THE AL?;

ANGELS, ORIOLES HOPE TO HOLD THEIR LEADS IN THE SECOND HALF

BALTIMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One team began the 1988 season 0-21. The other ended it 0-12. Bad teams, man, 
and neither seemed headed for much improvement at the outset of April 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, they've played 3 1/2 months and an All-Star game . . . and the 
Angels and the Baltimore Orioles still lead their respective divisions. More 
than that, the Angels are doing it with the best record in baseball (52-33) 
while the Orioles, at 48-37, hold a 5 1/2-game edge over the rest of the 
American League East. 
</P>
<P>
Are these July mirages, destined to vanish into sand as soon as the Oakland A's 
get healthy and the Toronto Blue Jays get their act together? 
</P>
<P>
Or can these turnarounds really be for real, with this weekend's four-game 
series in Baltimore's Memorial Stadium serving as a scouting report for 
October's league championship series? 
</P>
<P>
Seldom are such swift and complete reversals taken seriously -- The Cubs will 
be fading soon again, won't they? -- but Chili Davis has seen it happen before 
and offers a short history lesson to illustrate how it might happen again. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything can happen, man," says Davis, the Angels' home run leader with 11. 
"When I with the Giants, we had a team that lost 100 games in '85, came back to 
lead the division by the All-Star break in '86 and nearly made the World Series 
in '87. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at the Twins. They were cellar dwellers for how long? They won it all in 
'87 and won close to 200 the last two years." 
</P>
<P>
Uh, back to those '86 Giants, Chili. What happened after the All-Star break? 
That year, Houston, not San Francisco, won the West in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
"Injuries," Davis said. "Injuries killed that Giant club, especially the 
pitching staff . . . 
</P>
<P>
"But it can be done. A team can turn it around fast. It's a matter of getting 
the right chemistry among the players and the right person to guide 'em. You've 
got to have the right attitude, you've got to get rid of the selfishness." 
</P>
<P>
Davis stopped himself in mid-cliche, pausing for effect. 
</P>
<P>
"And, of course," he added, "a good pitching staff." 
</P>
<P>
Look no further than the AL team earned-run averages to find the foundation for 
the baseball resurgence in Anaheim and Baltimore. In 1988, the Angels and the 
Orioles finished 13th and 14th in the league in ERA, both over 4.30. In 1989, 
both clubs now rank among the top five, with the Angels' 2.89 mark the best in 
the league. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore, at 3.81, is fifth. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the Angels and the Orioles have their own ideas about resuscitating 
a pitching staff. Strategic differences exist. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels have relied predominantly on their starting rotation, receiving a 
total of 42 victories and 19 complete games from the quintet of Chuck Finley, 
Bert Blyleven, Kirk McCaskill, Jim Abbott and Mike Witt. The Orioles, 
meanwhile, have banked on Manager Frank Robinson's all-comers bullpen, with 
relievers Gregg Olson, Mark Williamson, Kevin Hickey and Mark Thurmond 
averaging more than 30 appearances apiece. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltimore rotation averages less than six innings per start per man and has 
produced just five complete games. Finley has nearly twice as many by himself 
with eight. 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, bullpen closer Bryan Harvey complains about not getting enough work 
because of the Angels' overly efficient rotation. 
</P>
<P>
In Baltimore, Robinson can't get his bullpen enough rest. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, certain similarities are apparent. Both staffs have been revived, in part, 
by a trade, a rookie and an out-of-left field surprise. 
</P>
<P>
The Trades: The Angels' Bert Blyleven and the Orioles' Brian Holton. One had 
exhausted his welcome in Minnesota, the other was mired in long relief with the 
Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
Acquired for the price of three minor leaguers, Blyleven, coming off a 10-17 
season, has surpassed even his own expectations thus far. His 2.13 ERA leads 
the American League and at 8-2 with four complete games, he was a glaring 
oversight on Tony La Russa's All-Star pitching corps. 
</P>
<P>
Holton, who came to Baltimore in the Eddie Murray deal, was thrust into a 
starting role when Jose Bautista went down and has had decent success. In nine 
starts, he is 3-5, but with a 3.45 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
The Rookies: The Angels' Jim Abbott and the Orioles' Gregg Olson. One is making 
history, the other never seems to make a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
Through the first half, Abbott has been a more effective pitcher than Witt, the 
Angels' opening day starter. With his outings monitored closely by Manager Doug 
Rader and pitching coach Marcel Lachemann -- he has just one complete game and 
is usually removed at the first sign of late-inning trouble -- Abbott is 8-5 
with a 3.56 ERA. Those eight victories make Abbott the winningest rookie 
pitcher to have made the jump from college to the majors since the adoption of 
baseball's free agent draft in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore's Olson has been little short of perfect for 3 1/2 months. His record 
is 3-0, his ERA 1.89 and he's 14 for 14 in save opportunities. If he doesn't 
burn out from overuse -- he's already appeared in 35 games, pitching 48 innings 
-- Olson figures to press Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. for the AL's rookie of the 
year award. 
</P>
<P>
Out of left field: The Angels' Chuck Finley and the Orioles' Jeff Ballard. One 
of them has gone from 9-15 to 10-6 and the All-Star game. The other went from 
8-12 to 10-4 and should have been in Anaheim Tuesday night, too. 
</P>
<P>
Finley's forkball has been the pitch of the hour for the Angels in 1989. Since 
he developed it, Finley's status as a starting pitcher has leaped from 
nondescript to one capable of striking out 15 batters in one game or pitching a 
one-hitter in Fenway Park. The Orioles know about the 15 strikeouts; last month 
in Anaheim, they were the ones doing the swinging and missing. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard was the surprise of the American League through the end of May as he 
won nine of his first 10 decisions. He's since been roughed up a little -- 1-3 
in his last four decisions -- but has shown recent signs of recovery, yielding 
just five runs in his last two outings. He was another no-show who belonged in 
this summer's All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, too, the Angels and the Orioles seem to have done their rebuilding 
along similar guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
Some fundamental steps: 
</P>
<P>
1) Hire managers who were busts in earlier assignments. Robinson, supposedly 
too heavy-handed in stops at Cleveland and San Francisco, and Rader, a washout 
in Texas, are now running 1-2 in the AL manager-of-the-year derby. 
</P>
<P>
2) Raid the Phillies. Baltimore's top hitter is ex-Phillie outfielder Phil 
Bradley, who's batting .312 with 36 RBIs. The Angels' second leading home run 
hitter is ex-Phillie catcher Lance Parrish, with 10 this season. 
</P>
<P>
3) Do anything to improve your outfield defense. The Angels accomplished this 
by signing right fielder Claudell Washington for $2.6 million so they could 
move Davis to safer ground in left. The Orioles did the same by trading again 
with the Dodgers, bringing them slick center fielder Mike Devereaux, and then 
instituting a five-man outfield shuttle. Devereaux, Bradley, Joe Orsulak, Brady 
Anderson and Steve Finley all split time. 
</P>
<P>
4) Take advantage of intradivisional strife. For the Angels, this has entailed 
winning as often as possible while Oakland has to play without Jose Canseco, 
Walt Weiss, Dennis Eckersley and Bob Welch. For the Orioles, this has meant 
capitalizing on Boston's pitching problems, Milwaukee's injury problems, 
Toronto's motivational problems and New York's Steinbrenner problem. 
</P>
<P>
How long can it last? As the Angels learned all too well in 1987 and 1988, 
August and September can be cruel months. The rough on this back-nine is always 
the roughest. 
</P>
<P>
But, for the time being, the last are first in the two divisions of the 
American League. Playoff preview? Probably not, but at least the next four days 
should be able to hold one's interest.

LONG MAY THEY WAVE;

<P>
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS, SURFING STILL HOLDS CHARM FOR KELLAR WATSON, LORRIN 
HARRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Kellar Watson was spending a carefree day near his summer home on Balboa in 
1928 when he heard that some people were riding wooden planks on the long, 
billowy breakers at Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't believe that," Watson, now 82, recalls. So he ran to the end of 
the Balboa Peninsula and perched atop the rock jetty to see what all the 
commotion was about. What he saw was Jerry Vultee, who later developed a plane 
used to train World War II fighter pilots, propelled across the water by 
nothing more than the force of a wave. Although it would be 30 years before 
surfing would capture the fancy of the country, if not the world, Watson 
immediately was enamored. He swam across the channel to Corona del Mar and was 
introduced to a cast of characters who left a lasting mark on Orange County's 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
Looking today at the serene entrance to Newport Harbor, luxury yachts bobbing 
at their moorings, it is difficult to envision it as once one of California's 
best surfing breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach, however, started attracting surfers as early as 1907. George 
Freeth, who brought the sport to Redondo Beach from Hawaii as a promotion for 
Henry Huntington's Red Cars, surfed Balboa that year. 
</P>
<P>
Few remember Freeth, but Duke Kahanamoku, known as the father of contemporary 
surfing, left a much more lasting impression during a visit in 1912. 
Kahanamoku, the swimming star of the 1912 Stockholm Olympics, thrilled 
curiosity seekers the day he surfed at Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
Even more came to watch when Kahanamoku, Sam Kahaliana and other Hawaiians 
returned in the mid-'20s, surfing at Corona del Mar on weekends while spending 
months at a time working in Hollywood as bit actors. Kahanamoku, a handsome, 
gentle man, began bringing his Hollywood friends along, and they would park 
their jalopies on the bluffs overlooking the beach and hold Hawaiian-style 
picnics. 
</P>
<P>
When Kahanamoku surfed here, the south swells hit a sand bar just off the 
Corona del Mar jetty, forming nicely shaped waves that could be ridden a 
quarter-mile all the way to China Cove. These were the best waves on the coast, 
wrote Frank Tucker in "Great Surfing." 
</P>
<P>
By the time Kellar Watson became a member of the surfing crowd at Corona del 
Mar in 1928, the sport was established among a cadre of 20 or so. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the earliest Orange County surfers to tackle the Corona del Mar break 
were Delbert (Bud) Higgins of Huntington Beach and Loren Harrison of San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Higgins, now deceased, was the chief lifeguard and, later, fire chief of 
Huntington Beach. His association with the sea naturally brought him to Corona 
del Mar, where he met the Hawaiians in the summer of 1927. Along with lifeguard 
Gene Belshe, Higgins decided to try to make what is regarded as the county's 
first homemade board. Kahanamoku suggested that his 11-foot board was too large 
for the Corona del Mar breakers, so the young locals set out to make two 
scaled-down, 10-foot boards. 
</P>
<P>
"We found we could buy a solid plank of kiln-dried redwood 20 feet long, 24 
inches wide and three inches thick for $40," Higgins wrote in the "History of 
Surfing in Huntington Beach." 
</P>
<P>
Higgins and Belshe cut the plank in half and shaped two boards with a block 
plane and draw knife. It took them three months to make their first boards, 
which, when completed, weighed 135 pounds each and were too heavy for most. "To 
carry them, they had to be stood on end, then carried on your back," Higgins 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Surfers such as Watson soon were experimenting with redwood-balsa wood 
combinations. "I can remember copper boards -- redwood inside with copper 
sheeting all around," Higgins once recalled in an interview. "And they had a 
drain plug to let the water out." 
</P>
<P>
Higgins was the first surfer to "shoot the pier" at Huntington Beach. Now, not 
a day goes by without some young surfer steering a surfboard through the pier 
pilings. 
</P>
<P>
Because they worked at Huntington Beach, Higgins and Belshe spent most of their 
time riding waves near the pier. They invited the Corona del Mar group to try 
their break, but because the rides at Huntington were much shorter, Corona del 
Mar remained the main surfing beach. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison would not go anywhere but Corona del Mar in those days. Harrison, 
perhaps more than any other Orange County native, embodies the spirit of 
surfing. Now a 76-year-old grandfather, Harrison remains a familiar sight at 
south county beaches. "I still surf three times a week," he says. 
</P>
<P>
In the late '20s, he would not miss a day. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison says he and his sister, Ethel, would walk along the bluffs from their 
summer home in Laguna Beach to Corona del Mar before the Coast Highway was 
completed. Harrison, who was born in Garden Grove in 1913 and attended Orange 
High School, moved easily among the Hollywood crowd. His surfing skills helped 
make him popular; he quickly established himself as one of the best. Ethel, 
too, was an outstanding surfer, and she later married and moved to Hawaii, 
where she practically reared her children on surfboards at Waikiki. 
</P>
<P>
Ethel also made surfing trunks for the Corona del Mar regulars. "We liked our 
suits custom-made, and Ethel turned out white canvas trunks ideal for 
bodysurfing," wrote Tucker. "The trunks sported the owners' names and perhaps a 
few individual touches: 'hump up,' 'slide left,' 'slot,' 'outside.' " 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Harrisons, the "in" crowd at Corona del Mar included Matt Brown, 
who later owned a popular Santa Ana bookstore, Barney Klotz, Mac (Laho Leo) 
Beal, Sol (Crazy Nel) Kalami and Gene (Tarzan) Smith. 
</P>
<P>
The times, the surfers recall, were good ones. For three summers, Kellar Watson 
and his buddies ran a hot dog stand on the beach. Watson had just earned a 
degree in pharmacy from USC, but could not resist the beach life. 
</P>
<P>
"My folks were greatly worried about me," says Watson, who eventually took over 
his father's drugstore near the Orange Plaza and ran it for some 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
In 1928, surfers started the Pacific Coast Surf Board Championship, which 
became the summer's biggest event. On the day of the first contest, Aug. 5, the 
Santa Ana Daily Register reported the largest "crowd that had visited the beach 
in the last five years" was on hand. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Blake of Redondo Beach was the victor in 1928, but Watson won the next year 
when he caught the longest ride of the day: "The wave was in a little from 
where most of the rest of the group was," he says. "And it got real big; it 
fooled them." 
</P>
<P>
These contests were a prelude to the U.S. Surfboard Championships, which 
started in 1958 at the Huntington Beach Pier and were held there each year 
through 1969. The competition, which was rotated to different sites in the 
early '70s before giving way to professional surfing, involved many of the 
world's best surfers and attracted crowds of up to 75,000 to Huntington Beach. 
In 1982, the Assn. of Surfing Professionals started staging at Huntington Beach 
a major contest featuring the world's best surfers. ASP's Bill Sharp says this 
event has become the world's largest in terms of spectators.

<P>
Orange County also paved the way on the high school level when coastal schools 
started holding competitions in the early '70s. In 1975, Marina High School in 
Huntington Beach had more students sign up for surfing than varsity football. 
That year, some schools petitioned the Southern Section of the California 
Interscholastic Federation to sanction the sport but were turned down. In 1978, 
surfers established the National Scholastic Surfing Assn. in Huntington Beach, 
which helped organize surfing programs for high schools and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
Before surfing tournaments became serious, however, Watson and his buddies were 
holding contests for fun. Watson's winning wave in 1929 was estimated as a 
10-footer, but Harrison says that the breakers often reached heights of 20 
feet. The big waves made for exciting times. 
</P>
<P>
For example, there was the day Mac Beal broke three surfboards on the jetty in 
three hours. Watson says many surfers crashed their boards on a concrete jetty 
after a wipeout, but few had the sour luck of Beal, who lost his board on a 
rough day and could do nothing but watch as it washed in and smashed against 
the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
He swam in and sat dejectedly on the beach until a friend loaned him a board. 
But Beal lost his friend's board, which also washed up and was demolished on 
the rock jetty. "Mac came in swearing he'd never borrow another board, but it 
wasn't long before he'd been talked into paddling out again on a generous 
friend's mount," Tucker wrote. 
</P>
<P>
And so ended board No. 3, also lost in the rocks. Quipped Tucker: "Mac flew 
P-38s for the Air Force during World War II but didn't crack up one as far as I 
know." 
</P>
<P>
The days of fun and surf, however, were numbered at Corona del Mar. Government 
officials, trying to turn Newport Beach into a safe harbor for small craft, 
commissioned the dredging of the channel. By 1935, surfing was all but lost 
when the rock jetty was extended outward beyond the natural break, effectively 
obstructing the waves. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison remembers the day in 1935 when Corona del Mar's waves became so dismal 
that the surfers packed three carloads of friends and drove to San Onofre. 
After their discovery of the good waves there, they never returned to Corona 
del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted a remote place where we wouldn't be in anyone's way. San Onofre was 
great; there was nothing there." 
</P>
<P>
Although it's about two miles beyond the Orange County border, San Onofre 
became an integral part of the county's surfing lore. Its expansive beaches 
provided a haven for surfers and proved to be a magnet for Los Angeles youths 
searching for the endless summer. Many of the San Onofre regulars took up 
residence in nearby San Clemente and Dana Point. They also found favorable surf 
at Dana Point, which they called "Killer Dana," until August 1966, when 
construction of a small boat harbor began. 
</P>
<P>
The 1930s turned into the '40s, and times changed for surfing. Most of the San 
Onofre regulars were involved in World War II in some capacity, and surfing for 
the most part was dormant. 
</P>
<P>
In a subtle way, though, the war had an influence on surfing. With the United 
States becoming a naval power, the need for aquatic products intensified. One 
tinkerer who helped the Navy was Bob Brown, who, according to Higgins, invented 
the spearfishing swim fin. 
</P>
<P>
In 1945, Brown was manufacturing fins for the Navy on Garfield Street in 
Huntington Beach. The Navy asked him to try making a rubber wet suit. According 
to Higgins, Brown made a mold of a figure of a man, dipped it in liquid rubber, 
then cooked it in steam. Wet suits, of course, have turned surfing into a 
year-round venture. 
</P>
<P>
By the late '40s, even the sanctuary of surfing was ripe for modernization. It 
was the age of plastics, and some surfers began experimenting with fiberglass 
surfboards. Their imaginations helped spawn the surfing industry, whose roots 
can be traced to the San Onofre regulars living in Dana Point and Capistrano 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
When Dow chemists developed Styrofoam for use in making floats in harbors, 
surfers finally had a material both durable and light enough to produce better 
surfboards. Much of the innovation was done in Palos Verdes by surfers such as 
Bob Simmons and Joe Quigg, who also spent many a day at San Onofre. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a kid who spent his summers in Laguna Beach, Hobie Alter, who 
advanced board-building to an art form. Alter, who opened one of the world's 
first surfboard shops in a Laguna Beach garage in the early 1950s, began in the 
early '60s mass producing 10-foot boards that were made of plastic products and 
had a balsa wood strip down the center. 
</P>
<P>
Alter had help. Gordon (Grubby) Clark, who had earned a physics and mathematics 
degree from Pomona College, began a foam company nearby that today is one of 
the largest manufacturers of Styrofoam surfboard blanks. These blanks, shaped 
like wooden 2x4 planks, are turned into custom-made surfboards. 
</P>
<P>
Innovations were not limited to water-related products. Accessories, including 
clothing, became important. Guiding the country's fashion palate were 
Capistrano Beach's Hoffman brothers, Walter and Philip, who in the early 1960s 
started the casual beach-wear designs with floral print and pin-stripe shirts. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, Jon Severson, who has since moved to Maui, left Los 
Angeles to start Surfer magazine in Dana Point. Today, Surfer and Surfing, the 
sport's oldest publications, are based in the south county. 
</P>
<P>
The surfing-film industry also mushroomed from these roots with the help of 
photographer Bud Brown. Such films as "The Endless Summer" and "Five Summer 
Stories" were produced by south county film makers. Some of the scenes featured 
Orange County surfers. 
</P>
<P>
The transformation of a casual sport into a multimillion-dollar industry with 
its own films and magazines has had its effect on the evolution of surfing as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
The Corona del Mar and San Onofre surfers experimented with better surfboards 
as they sought innovations. They were not content to ride an immobile 10-foot 
piece of wood. They wanted to defy the laws of gravity when gliding up and down 
a fast-breaking wave. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Edwards of Dana Point, a 51-year-old catamaran builder, changed forever 
the way people surf by using the edge of his surfboard to cut across the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
Edward's innovative style in the 1950s was the steppingstone for county surfers 
in the 1960s and beyond with Corky Carroll of San Clemente, Brad McCaul of 
Newport Beach and Mickey Munoz of Laguna Beach gaining international 
recognition for their personal styles. 
</P>
<P>
They might have come from different eras, but they all had an affinity for the 
sea. For many of them, that bond still has a tight grip. 
</P>
<P>
Kellar Watson says he went bodysurfing at Dana Point last year at age 81. As 
the waves brought him tumbling toward the shore, long-dormant memories of a 
bygone era were awakened. 
</P>
<P>
"I think back to those days as being the best times of my life," Watson says. 
"Looking at those waves at Dana Point, well, I couldn't resist it." 
</P>
<P>
Just like that summer day in '28 when he saw his first surfer.

<TEXT>
<P>
This glossary of surfing terms has been gleaned from Jon Severson's book, 
"Great Surfing," San Diego surfing writer Steve Barilotti and from years of 
personal living along the Orange County coast. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aggro: A contemporary term imported from Australia meaning aggressive surfing. 
</P>
<P>
Amped: A contemporary term used when surfers are excited about the surf. Also 
used to describe overly aggressive surfing characterized by jerky motions. 
</P>
<P>
Backpedal: Foot-over-foot walking backward toward the rear of a long board. The 
short-board revolution pretty much ended walking the board. 
</P>
<P>
Backwash: A wave or current that heads back toward the sea. The condition 
usually is found on a steep beach at high tide. 
</P>
<P>
Baggies: A style of swimsuit, usually worn large and patterned with Hawaiian 
floral prints or wide stripes, that first became popular in the 1950s and came 
back in vogue in the early '80s. Bail: To exit a board by jumping off to avoid 
being knocked off by a wave. 
</P>

Bottom turn: A maneuver in which the surfer turns toward the top of the wave 
after descending to the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Bowl: A shallow spot in the wave causing the wave to break a little harder and 
faster. Surfers either turn wide around a bowl or go through it for a tube 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
Break: The spot where the waves form, allowing for the maximum ride. 
</P>
<P>
Classic: Used to describe a perfect-forming wave. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanup: A wave that breaks way beyond the normal break line, often forcing 
surfers to scramble to paddle over it.

Crest: The highest point of a wave before it breaks. 
</P>
<P>
Curl: The breaking part of the wave. 
</P>

the peak of the forming wave has the right of way. This also is called shoulder 
hopping. 
</P>
<P>
Deck: The top of a surfboard.

Elephant gun: A large, toothpick of a surfboard used for big surf. It often is 
referred to as a gun or a rhino chaser. 
</P>
<P>
Face: The unbroken front of a wave between the crest and the trough.

Reef break: A rock or coral bottom that helps form waves for desirable rides. 
</P>
<P>
Rubber arms: A condition of being so tired it is difficult to lift the arms to 
paddle the board. 
</P>
<P>
Set: A group of waves breaking in intervals one after the other.

ON THIS DAY, DUKE KAHANAMOKU PLAYED HERO'S ROLE TO PERFECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The day, June 14, 1925, was made for legends. 
</P>
<P>
There on the beach near the Newport harbor mouth was Duke Kahanamoku, the 
Olympic swimming champion-turned-actor, lounging with a group of Hollywood 
cronies who came to Newport Beach for long weekends during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
A handful of Duke's fellow surfers also were enjoying one of those days with a 
Monet sky and large, translucent waves pounding the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly the serenity was shattered by a woman's screams. Someone else ran down 
the beach yelling for lifeguards. In the harbor, the pleasure yacht Thelma had 
capsized with 29 on board. 
</P>
<P>
In the midst of the chaos, Kahanamoku grabbed his 114-pound redwood surfboard 
and paddled through the giant breakers toward the panic-stricken victims. He 
reached one, pulled him on his surfboard and then paddled toward shore. 
</P>
<P>
He repeated the effort several times, each time rescuing more survivors as a 
crowd along the beach stood and watched. 
</P>
<P>
After the ordeal, 17 had died. Of the 12 saved, Kahanamoku had rescued eight. 
</P>
<P>
"His role on the beach that day was more dramatic than the scores he played in 
four decades of intermittent bit-part acting in Hollywood films," The Times 
wrote. "For one thing, he was the star." ELLIOTT ALMOND

RUNNING: WEIDENBACH STAYING ON TRACK TOWARD GOAL OF OLYMPIC TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbie Ludovise 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last October, six months after failing to make the U.S. Olympic women's 
marathon team for the second consecutive time, Lisa Weidenbach won the Chicago 
Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her earnings -- more than $70,000 in prize and appearance money -- and 
a personal-best time of 2 hours 29 minutes 17 seconds, Weidenbach was not 
entirely satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"This is kind of bittersweet," she said after the race. "Nothing can make up 
for not making the Olympic team. It is my goal and ultimate motivation." 
</P>
<P>
The Olympics are the ultimate motivation for many runners, of course. But in 
Weidenbach's case, getting there has been something of a tragicomedy. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Weidenbach, running in only her third marathon, placed fourth in the 
Olympic Trials. Only the top three finishers earn an Olympic team berth. 
Weidenbach was in third place with a mile to go, but was passed by Julie 
Isphording down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
In a race that, for her, lasted 2 hours and 35 minutes, Weidenbach missed the 
team by 44 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Weidenbach placed fourth again, this time by 48 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1984, I wasn't disappointed because it was just my third marathon, and I 
only had the 16th-fastest time going in," Weidenbach, 27, said. "But all these 
people said, 'Oh, you poor thing! You were fourth.' But then the second time it 
happened, it was the longest summer of my life." 
</P>
<P>
To alleviate her disappointment, Weidenbach immediately set new goals. One was 
to win the 1988 Chicago Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the first time I said such a thing -- that I was going to win a 
race," she said. "Not only that, but I was going to win for me. Not my parents, 
my husband, my dog or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
Weidenbach, who will run the invitational portion of the San Clemente 5,000 at 
8 a.m. Sunday, started her athletic career at 5, with swimming. 
</P>
<P>
By the time she was a freshman at Michigan, Weidenbach had qualified for the 
Olympic swimming trials, but the trials never happened because of the U.S. 
boycott of the 1980 Games. Soon thereafter, Weidenbach started running, found 
she enjoyed it more than swimming, and went out for Michigan's cross-country 
and track teams the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Although Weidenbach said she didn't even make the traveling team her first 
year, and was burdened by the stress-related injuries common to new runners, 
she progressed rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
The many miles trimmed her 5-foot 10-inch swimmer's frame from 140 to 125 
pounds. And with some impressive natural speed -- she was able to run the mile 
under 5 minutes her first year -- Weidenbach was on her way. 
</P>
<P>
After her victory at Chicago, Weidenbach set out to make 1989 her best year. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Weidenbach, a resident of the Seattle suburb of Issaquah, is right on 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Weidenbach set the U.S. record for the 15K at the Gasparilla 
Distance event. Her time of 49:01 broke the record of 49:25 set by Betty 
Springs in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
In April, Weidenbach set the U.S. record for 10 miles (52:34) at the Nike 
Cherry Blossom race in Washington, D.C. Weidenbach also broke her American 15K 
record (48:58) along the way. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Weidenbach won the Cascade Run Off in Portland, improving again on her 
15K record (48:28). That time took six seconds off the course record set by 
Grete Waitz of Norway. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 15K distance is where Weidenbach's strength now lies -- she said 
Sunday's 5K race will be mainly just a speed workout -- her hopes three years 
from now undoubtedly will be focused again on the marathon. Namely, the 1992 
Trials. 
</P>
<P>
The pressure undoubtedly will be enormous. 
</P>
<P>
"I try not to think of it that way," she said. "But when I sit and think about 
it, it is a tremendous pressure that I feel. For now, I just to focus in on the 
races coming up such as the San Clemente 5,000. That way I'm able to keep 
things in perspective. That way if I don't make an Olympic team, at least I'll 
know I still had a great career. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, Michael Jordan may never win an NBA championship, but he's still 
having a great career. Ingrid Kristinsen has never won an Olympic medal, but 
she's still known as one of the best women runners ever . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Of course I say this now, (but) come the '92 Trials, I'll probably be a 
wreck." 
</P>
<P>
Postcard from Europe: Former University High star Greg Whiteley is for the 
first time competing on the prestigious and often lucrative European track 
circuit this summer. 
</P>
<P>
His message, via air mail: "Well, I made it to 'The Show.' Tonight, I'm pacing 
(Yobes) Ondieki of Kenya to an attempted world record for 5,000 meters. Monday, 
I race Stockholm and then it's back to England for a week before I go to Nice. 
I've met what seems like every famous runner there is: Steve Ovett, John 
Walker, Dave Moorcroft. . . . I've brushed elbows with Paula Ivan and Said 
Aouita. . . . Sincerely, G.W." 
</P>
<P>
Newport Beach native PattiSue Plumer continues to dominate women's distance 
fields through the European track circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Plumer, a 1988 Olympian, overcame cold, windy conditions to win the 3,000 last 
Friday at the IAC International Grand Prix track and field meet. Plumer won in 
8:43.82, more than a second ahead of Britain's Liz McColgan. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, Plumer was selected to represent the U.S. in the World University Games 
at Duisburg, West Germany, Aug. 22-30. 
</P>
<P>
Track-happy: After years of waiting, Saddleback College's track and field teams 
have a new track. 
</P>
<P>
Although it won't be ready for use for another week or so -- it's getting lane 
line markings today -- the new all-weather track is a tremendous addition to 
Saddleback's track programs. The track Saddleback had been using for the last 
few years had been slowly falling apart, Coach Gene Gurule said, and despite 
several efforts to resurface it, the track continued to crumble. 
</P>
<P>
"It was so bad, we could just pick up big pieces of it and walk away with it," 
Gurule said. "Part of lane one was practically gone. It got to the point where 
we had to postpone track meets because it was so bad." 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the track, estimated at $175,000, will be paid by the school. 
Gurule said he hopes to hold all-comers meets as soon as August as well as the 
Orange County boys' track and field championships at Saddleback next year.

OFFERING BY PARENT OF LINCOLN S&amp;L IN IRVINE; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNOR DENIES POLITICS IN OK OF DEBT SECURITIES SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian said Wednesday that politics played no role in his 
administration's decision to approve the sale of high-risk debt securities to 
the public by the parent company of troubled Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions at a press conference in Sacramento, the governor said 
"there was nothing done that I have been informed about, that I am aware of, 
that was irregular or improper" about the Department of Corporations approval 
of the securities sales. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian said news stories have created a "false impression" that Charles H. 
Keating Jr., chairman of the Phoenix firm that owns Lincoln, wielded political 
influence through his contributions to Deukmejian's reelection campaign and his 
connections to administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's firm, American Continental Corp., filed for protection from creditors 
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws on April 13. Regulators seized 
Lincoln the next day. 
</P>
<P>
Among those affected by the bankruptcy filing are 22,000 people who bought $200 
million in unsecured subordinated debentures at Lincoln's 29 branches in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the bondholders contend that they were falsely led to believe that the 
bonds were federally insured. They recently filed a $250-million claim against 
the Department of Corporations, alleging that the agency improperly approved 
the securities sales. The bondholders claim that the agency was swayed because 
Keating had contributed heavily to Deukmejian's campaign and had retained a law 
firm with ties to Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing earlier comments by Department of Corporations Commissioner Christine 
Bender, the governor said the agency had no choice but to approve the 
securities sales once they were cleared by the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
To reject the sales, the state would have had to prove that they would not be 
"just, fair and equitable," Deukmejian said. But Bender has said her agency 
could not find that proof last year. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Los Angeles law firm used by American Continental to seek 
approval of the bond sales had ties to his administration, Deukmejian said that 
those connections did not affect the state agency's decision. 
</P>
<P>
A senior partner at the firm -- Parker, Milliken, Clark, O'Hara &amp; Samuelian 
-- is Karl Samuelian, who was the chief fund-raiser for the governor's 1986 
reelection campaign. Another partner, Franklin Tom, was commissioner of the 
Corporations Department before quitting in February, 1987, to return to the 
firm. His replacement at the agency, Bender, had been an associate at Parker, 
Milliken. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, campaign contribution reports show that Keating and a number of 
family members and company executives funneled at least $41,000 into 
Deukmejian's 1986 campaign. The governor said he has met Keating only once. 
</P>
<P>
"What is important is what the facts are," Deukmejian said. "And the truth is 
that there was no decision made because of any campaign contributions that were 
made, nor, for that matter, because of any law firm that represented this 
particular savings and loan." 
</P>
<P>
Meantime, American Continental has filed a draft of a reorganization plan that 
promises to pay off shareholders, bondholders and other creditors in full but 
offers the repayment over time and at reduced interest. 
</P>
<P>
The 31-page document, filed Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix, 
includes the proposed purchase by American Continental of a Lincoln subsidiary 
called Amcor Funding Corp., which holds more than $855 million in assets. The 
subsidiary's major asset is a 20% interest in General Oriental Investments 
Ltd., an international trading company operated by British financier Sir James 
Goldsmith. 
</P>
<P>
Amcor Funding, which is one of 11 Lincoln subsidiaries also put into 
bankruptcy, is under the control of federal regulators who are running Lincoln. 
The proposed purchase of Amcor would provide American Continental with the cash 
flow it needs to pay off its debtors. 
</P>
<P>
Keating plans to use $25 million in cash from an outside investor and 
promissory notes to pay for Amcor, according to previously released statements 
from American Continental. 
</P>
<P>
Keating is negotiating with several investors about joining the plan, according 
to James J. Feder, the company's bankruptcy lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Under the reorganization plan, the debenture holders would get 11-year notes 
bearing 5% interest. A special $20-million fund would be created immediately to 
pay those holders who could show hardship to an independent administrator of 
the fund. 
</P>
<P>
Other creditors holding secured and senior unsecured debts would be paid in two 
years at the same 5% rate. Those holding preferred stock and common stock, 
other than corporate insiders, would get new American Continental preferred 
stock that pays the 5% rate and would have to be redeemed in 12 to 14 years. 
Once all debts are repaid, corporate insiders would be paid off.

St. Joseph Hospital will open its Irvine Health Center on Saturday. The center 
is an outreach facility that will provide a broad array of diagnostic and 
treatment services. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Gaschen, a spokesman for the Orange-based hospital, said the 
40,000-square-foot building at 4050 Barranca Parkway will contain the offices 
of two primary care physician groups, Doctors of Children for Orange County and 
Doctors of Women Health Center. 
</P>
<P>
He said there are also plans to add internal medicine and family practice 
groups. Besides primary physicians, he said, the center will provide time-share 
offices for at least 40 specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Gaschen said the opening of the Irvine facility is "part of a growing trend for 
the hospital to establish primary care networks throughout Orange County." St. 
Joseph has also said it will open an urgent care center in east Orange this 
fall.

'SMOKELESS' DIESEL ENGINE TO BE TESTED IN SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES STROUSE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thick, black truck exhaust, as much a part of the Southern California 
experience as sunshine and sea breezes, could one day become a thing of the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
Navistar International Corp., the Chicago conglomerate that builds 
International trucks, will begin testing the nation's first "smokeless" diesel 
engine in Southern California sometime during the next year, the company said 
Wednesday at a trade show in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
The new design, called "Smokeless 94," emits almost clear exhaust because it 
burns fuel more efficiently than the traditional diesel engines that power most 
big trucks, Navistar said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the company had several prototypes on display at the International 
Truck Show, the engines will not be released commercially until 1994. The 
design must still be tested on the road by truckers, the firm said. 
</P>
<P>
Navistar increased the engine's efficiency by boosting cylinder pressure to 
unusually high levels and designing a new type of piston, said James 
McCandless, a Navistar vice president who headed research on the engine. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the nation's largest truck makers have been experimenting with more 
efficient diesel engines for several years to meet tougher clean air standards 
scheduled to take effect in 1991, said Arthur G. Davis, an auto industry 
analyst at Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben, a New York brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
So far, though, most improvements have involved filtering exhaust fumes more 
effectively, rather than burning fuel more efficiently, Davis said. Other 
companies have designed "particulate traps" that can filter exhausts of engines 
now in use. 
</P>
<P>
McCandless said particulate filters are less fuel efficient than an engine with 
little black exhaust, and are inconvenient because they must be regularly 
cleaned of carbon. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the Navistar design must be tested before its commercial potential can 
be gauged, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"Navistar is first with this engine, but there's no magic formula for success, 
because higher pressure means more wear," Davis said. "A trucker wants to know 
whether the engine is durable before he'll buy it, and that's something they'll 
have to test." 
</P>
<P>
Navistar, the nation's leading manufacturer of large and medium-size trucks, 
said it has spent $20 million per year on research in the last few years to 
develop the engine. 
</P>
<P>
The firm said it chose Southern California for testing because the engine uses 
catalytic converters that are damaged by high levels of sulfur contained in 
diesel fuel sold in other states. California has required low-sulfur diesel 
fuel for the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
The company said its next step is to find a trucking company in Southern 
California that will test 25 to 30 trucks equipped with the smokeless engine.

THEATREFAIRE AIMING TO MAKE CHILDREN THEATERGOERS FOR LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
With a drawl as thick as maple syrup oozin' down a stack of hot cakes, 
storyteller Eric Kern promises a tale that will "stick to you like pea-nutty 
butter sticks to the roof of your mouth." Then, for the next 45 minutes, the 
17-year-old actor, a central figure in Irvine Valley Theatrefaire for 
Children's production of "Jack and the Beanstalk," spins a countrified version 
of the classic story that seems to delight young and old. 
</P>
<P>
The play, which runs through July 22 in the Irvine Valley College Forum 
Theatre, is the eighth season-opener for the children's theater company. 
</P>
<P>
Stories that stick in the minds of young audiences is the goal of Theatrefaire, 
says Blake Gould, the group's artistic director. 
</P>
<P>
"If a child returns to see a show and something sticks in his memory, it's a 
memory that will last a lifetime," said Gould, a theater arts instructor who, 
with his wife, Charlene, founded the group in 1982. "Theater habits begin in 
childhood. The way we see it, we're helping to develop audiences for all the 
performing arts." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Valley Theatrefaire presents two to three children's productions each 
summer on the college campus. Funded in part by the college, the shows feature 
local actors and surprisingly high production values. The combination seems 
successful, according to Gould -- last year's three-play season attracted an 
audience of 7,000 children and adults. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided at the beginning to do theater that would really be main stage 
quality, not just 'Let's pretend,' " Gould said. "We would have crafts people 
designing the sets and costumes as if children really were the most important 
people coming to see theater." 
</P>
<P>
"We want this to be a first-class experience for the adults and the kids," said 
Charlene Gould, who serves as executive producer for the company. "And we're 
seeing a great response. It's not a drop-off, kiddie matinee kind of thing. The 
parents come with the kids to the shows. It's a shared experience for the whole 
family." 
</P>
<P>
Past Theatrefaire seasons have included such grade-school favorites as 
"Pinocchio," "Tom Sawyer" and "Snow White." "Jack and the Beanstalk" continues 
in that vein, but as adapted and directed by Greg Atkins, it contains a few 
chuckles for mom and dad too. 
</P>
<P>
"I like children's plays that work on many levels," said Atkins, who also works 
with South Coast Repertory's popular Young Conservatory program and directs and 
performs with a number of local theater groups. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, the original story of 'Jack and the Beanstalk' is awful. He goes up 
and steals for no reason then kills the giant. I didn't want to propagate that 
idea, so I tried to write the story in a way that would be fun for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
"It's about the I.R.S and big government taking things away from the little 
guy," Atkins explained. "The businessman (who takes Jack's family cow in 
exchange for a magic bean) is obviously big business foreclosing on the farmer, 
and the goose that lays the golden eggs is named Lottie, for Lotto, because we 
all want to win big." 
</P>
<P>
Even in the confines of the tiny theater, "Jack and the Beanstalk" is a visual 
treat. Mary Ann Griego's costumes blend Appalachian corn-pone with fairy-tale 
splendor (for the giant's magic harp, Griego outfitted Angela Kang in a 
fanciful, gold-toned kimono with a built-in, scaled-down harp). And Wally 
Huntoon's setting features a complicated piece that serves first as the 
castle's forbidding entry, then swings apart to reveal the giant's kitchen, 
fully outfitted with a glowing, smoking stove. Lighting is by Bill Liotta and 
sound by Eric Kerns. 
</P>
<P>
Later this season, Irvine Valley Theatrefaire presents "Twin Desperadoes," a 
Western-style adaptation of Shakespeare's "Comedy of Errors" geared for all 
ages. 
</P>
<P>
"This one is a real departure for us," said Gould, who co-wrote the script with 
Atkins and Christopher Villa. "It's completely original . . . with apologies to 
Wild Bill Shakespeare. We'll have singing cowboys, lots of music, all the 
favorite B-movie Western stuff that many of us grew up with." The show will run 
July 21 through 29 on an outdoor stage on the college campus. 
</P>
<P>
Theatrefaire organizers have ambitious plans for the future. In the 1990-91 
season, the group is scheduled to stage a lavish production of "The Hobbit" in 
the new Irvine Theatre, a 750-seat house under construction on the UC Irvine 
campus. The company hopes to present one or two productions there each year. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever the venue, Gould says it's the response of young audiences that 
keeps Theatrefaire artists committed. 
</P>
<P>
"I just tell everybody in the show that they will have the best audience of 
their entire lives," Gould said. 
</P>
<P>
"After every show, we have an autograph session with the cast," he explained. 
"Kids are so honest, you wouldn't believe the comments. After 'Snow White,' a 
little boy came up to the woman who played the queen and gave her this big hug. 
He said, 'I need to give you a hug because I think nobody else likes you.' 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get that kind of feedback anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Valley Theatrefaire for Children presents "Jack and the Beanstalk" at 
the Irvine Valley College Forum Theatre, 5500 Irvine Center Drive, Irvine. 
Performances are as follows: today, July 20 and 21, 2 p.m.; Friday and 
Saturday, 2 and 7 p.m.; and July 22, 2 and 6 p.m. Tickets: $6 for children 
under 14, $8 for adults. Group discounts are available. "Twin Desperadoes" runs 
July 21 through 29. For ticket information on both shows, call (714) 559-3333 
weekdays only.

The San Francisco producer who is putting Ken Hill's "The Phantom of the Opera" 
on tour (see story Page 7) has accused the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim of 
selling tickets to the show and advertising it without legal authorization. 
"The show is not coming to Anaheim," Jonathan Reinis said Wednesday. "They are 
not authorized to present it in any form or manner. They've been selling 
tickets illegally. They are advertising it illegally." Reinis, who owns 
American rights to this "Phantom" (not to be confused with Andrew Lloyd 
Webber's version), said the Celebrity Theatre has ignored "repeated requests" 
since January to stop selling tickets. At the office of the Celebrity's parent 
company in Phoenix, company official Bill Taylor said: "This is the first I've 
heard" of the matter. He said the owner of the company, Ed Haddad, could not be 
reached for comment. Nick Masters, the booking manager of the Celebrity, also 
could not be reached for comment. On Wednesday, the Celebrity box office was 
still selling tickets to Hill's "Phantom," which is advertised to run Dec. 26 
through 30. Reinis said the theater had negotiated for the show but had "never 
consummated its contract." He said his attorney sent the theater another letter 
Wednesday demanding that it "ceast and desist" from selling or advertising the 
show, and threatened legal action if it did not.

FOR CAMPER VAN BEETHOVEN, TUNEUP TOUR IS TIMELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since scoring a breakthrough in alternative-rock circles last year with its 
widely admired major-label debut, "Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart," 
Camper Van Beethoven has kept an uncharacteristically low public profile. 
</P>
<P>
Now, eight months after its last live gig, the once-prolific band takes its 
first tentative steps back on the road with a short tuneup tour that includes a 
stop Friday at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. A full tour is planned 
for fall, following the late August release of a new album, "Key Lime Pie." 
</P>
<P>
The current nine-city blitz opened in Fresno, winds up in the Northern 
California hamlet of Guerneville and even includes a stop in Tijuana. That's 
hardly a typical itinerary for most bands, but it fits the profile for Santa 
Cruz-based CVB, which has long traveled off rock's beaten path -- both 
geographically and musically. 
</P>
<P>
"This is really how we started the band," bassist Victor Krummenacher said in a 
telephone interview from Fresno, where CVB had just pulled in after a four-hour 
van ride. The current tour, he said, is a "back-to-the-roots sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
Besides allowing the band to shake off the dust of the longest touring layoff 
in its history, the preview shows provide a chance to break in new violinist 
Morgan Fichter. CVB and former violinist Jonathan Segel parted ways after the 
last tour over increasing creative conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't working well anymore," Krummenacher said. "It had become kind of a 
dysfunctional situation." 
</P>
<P>
Violin is pivotal in much of Camper Van Beethoven's music, which is heavily 
influenced by Eastern European and other folk strains, so replacing Segel was a 
tall order. "We had several auditions," Krummenacher said. "We found some very 
good musicians." 
</P>
<P>
The band finally settled on Fichter. They had met when her previous band, Harm 
Farm, opened for CVB. "We kind of stumbled across Morgan," Krummenacher said. 
</P>
<P>
The bassist has high hopes for "Key Lime Pie," whose sound he described as more 
"warm and organic" than the last album. "I think we paid a little more 
attention to how we wanted to sound." 
</P>
<P>
Although there are some lighter moments on the new album, overall the songs are 
darker and moodier than previous CVB efforts, Krummenacher said. Also, he said, 
the album is more coherent than "Our Beloved Revolutionary Sweetheart," which 
took in a broad range of styles. "I think it flows well," the bassist said. "I 
think the last one was a little on the schizophrenic side." 
</P>
<P>
Krummenacher expects the new album to build on the core audience forged with 
last year's Virgin Records debut, which expanded a strong cult following built 
through several independent albums and EPs and incessant touring: "I think this 
one will see a lot more radio play than the last one. . . . I think we will 
kind of sway some people." 
</P>
<P>
 Camper Van Beethoven plays at 9 p.m. Friday at the Coach House, 33157 Camino 
Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $17.50. Information: (714) 496-8930.

CULVER CITY PLANS TO CELEBRATE ITS MOVIE TOWN HERITAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SPENCER S. HSU, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifty years ago, Culver City witnessed a column of black smoke rising from 30 
acres of burning movie lot props on city land and knew that the filming of an 
American cultural milestone had begun. 
</P>
<P>
City leaders hope to capture a sliver of the glamour as the Culver City 
Historical Society marks the golden anniversary of the production of "Gone With 
the Wind." That glamour, made visible in part by the extravagant "burning of 
Atlanta," is ordinarily denied this small movie town, which was once tagged 
"The Heart of Fast-Food Land" by one of its own council members. 
</P>
<P>
The site of production for such cinematic landmarks as "Citizen Kane," "King 
Kong" and "The Wizard of Oz," Culver City would seem the natural choice for a 
"Gone With the Wind" commemorative bash. After all, the city's slogan is "The 
Heart of Screenland." 
</P>
<P>
After three-quarters of a century of film-making, the passing of nearly a dozen 
studios and the production of nearly one-third of American feature-length films 
within its limits, Culver City plans to spend a day reclaiming the splendor 
lost in the shadow of Hollywood's glitz. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Museum Fund-Raiser 
</P>
<P>
This Sunday, about 400 neighbors and fans will throw a hometown-flavored 
commemoration at the restored Culver Studios, where the epic of the South 
during the Civil War was shot. Intended as a fund-raiser, proceeds from the 
public event will go toward the 9-year-old historical society's goal of 
securing a permanent museum. 
</P>
<P>
Featured offerings include Mayor Jozelle Smith as emcee for a Clark Gable 
look-alike contest and 1930s-era refreshments peddled by the local YMCA. More 
serious film buffs and "Gone With the Wind" devotees can see exhibits of 
unpublished movie production photographs, original screenplays and the historic 
studio where original props and dressing rooms remain intact. Dozens of those 
involved in the original production have agreed to attend, including the actor 
with the film's opening lines as Scarlett's suitor; the great-nephew of Hattie 
McDaniel, who won an Academy Award for her role as Mammy, and a longtime 
companion of and secretary to Vivien Leigh, the actress selected to play 
Scarlett O'Hara after a two-year, nationwide search. 
</P>
<P>
But, oddly, Culver City was never swept up in the publicity enveloping "Gone 
With the Wind," which set box-office records for decades and has never been 
equaled in hype. Yet when producer David O. Selznick started filming with the 
"burning of Atlanta" sequence on Dec. 10, 1938, it was in a Culver City studio 
lot with the entire city Fire Department watching nervously nearby. The town 
also contributed dozens of extras for the film and even Selznick's famed still 
photographer, Fred A. Parrish, who took more than 10,000 promotional shots. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Humiliating Survey 
</P>
<P>
Instead, for decades, tourists looking for the excitement of the silver screen 
never considered Culver City. Added to that was a humiliating 1983 survey 
confirming that most out-of-staters had never heard of the city and 
Californians had considered it old, run-down, ugly or boring. 
</P>
<P>
And if being the plain, if respectable, sister to fashionable Westside 
communities, such as Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, Westwood and Venice, were not 
enough, Culver City over the years suffered the indignity of anonymity as even 
longtime resident Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer credited the location of all its 
productions as "Hollywood" until the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, (Culver City) was a studio town more than a glamour town, while 
Hollywood was both," says Marc Wanamaker, a Los Angeles film historian. 
</P>
<P>
The distinction came through even during the heyday of the big movie studios in 
the 1920s and '30s, according to cinematic histories. 
</P>
<P>
"MGM . . . is a short distance from 20th (Century Fox), but the distance is all 
downhill," states one 1981 book. "Culver City, home of MGM, is to Beverly Hills 
as Yonkers is to Scarsdale. Culver City looks as if there should be a feed 
store on the corner of State and Main." 
</P>
<P>
The movies also brought their own form of undesirables to town. Swept up in the 
big productions of the 1930s and '40s, Culver City saw the rise of gambling, 
drinking and prostitution. Locally, the film industry's reputation began to 
suffer. 
</P>
<P>
"The stars and studios kind of ran Culver City for years," said former city 
Councilman A. Ronald Perkins, a Culver City police officer from the 1950s 
through the early part of the 1970s. But the occasional sighting of celebrities 
such as Joan Crawford or MGM owner Howard Hughes could not compensate for the 
brawls and other vices commonplace at the time. 
</P>
<P>
That's the past Culver City's historical society has begun to clean up. While 
searching for museum space for its growing collection of movie and other 
historical objects, the society has also polished the city's sullied 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"Any place you go in the world has a history," says society fund raiser Julie 
Lugo Cerra. "You just need to find it." 
</P>
<P>
With society President Marti Diviak and Joy Jacobs, its public relations 
director, Lugo can tick off a proud civic history worthy of any California 
town. Replete with noble Mexican ranch families, Catholic missions and Anglo 
settlers, Culver City's past includes many a proud -- and peculiar -- moment. 
</P>
<P>
The society's collections include oral histories of the Prohibition-era Cotton 
and Plantation nightclubs and 68 vintage MGM costumes from numerous films. It 
has also placed bronze markers at eight historic city sites. 
</P>
<P>
And its work has become a civic enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm eminently qualified to do this because my mother was in love with Clark 
Gable," says Smith. Smith, who will judge the Clark Gable impersonators Sunday, 
is a society member and lifelong Culver City resident. 
</P>
<P>
Several other city employees have joined the society, and in 1986, 40 local 
businesses and more than 100 citizens contributed their names and money to 
create "The Game of Culver City," a variant of Monopoly, the popular Parker 
Bros. game. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, about 100 descendants of Harry H. Culver swept into town to mark 
the 75th anniversary of when their real estate developer ancestor bought the 
land that became his dream city. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the historical society and City Council are working to bring a Beverly 
Hills house, originally built in 1921 in Culver City, back to the town. Listed 
for $1.75 million, the Willat Studio (also known as "the Witch's House" for its 
unique architecture) may be used as a museum and storage space. 
</P>
<P>
Culver City life is clearly no longer dominated as it was in days past by names 
such as MGM, De Mille, RKO, Pathe, Selznick, Desilu, Roche and Laird 
International. Postwar population booms and dozens of commercial and 
residential developments in the past five years have broadened the community's 
economic base. 
</P>
<P>
These days, residents talk of the city as a "family town" and reminisce about 
times when sets and lots dominated street-side scenery. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Schwartz, 62, closed down Big Ed's bar in 1986, an establishment that had 
served as a town landmark under various ownerships since the 1940s. Upon 
closing, he reflected, "(Culver's) a very Puritan town now. It's so clean it 
squeaks. . . . There's nothing wrong with that; it's just the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
The historical society doesn't mind. With its members, the city and Sunday's 
fund-raiser bringing a museum that much closer to life, its leaders realize 
that the movies are here to stay, and, in Scarlett's words, "Tomorrow is 
another day." 
</P>
<P>
There is a limited number of tickets available for Sunday's 2 to 5 p.m. event 
at the Culver Studios, 9336 Washington Blvd. Tickets are $10 for adults, $7.50 
for seniors and children under 12.

STRESS: Mental or physical tension or strain. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Webster's New World Dictionary 
</P>
<P>
Stress problems are increasing in professional coaching today. The evidence can 
be found almost everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
There have been five such victims this year -- three National Basketball Assn. 
coaches, a National Football League coach, Mike Ditka of the Chicago Bears, 
and, most recently, an American League manager, Sparky Anderson of the Detroit 
Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Ditka has had a heart problem. Anderson was a victim of nervous exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
The stressed-out NBA coaches, whose symptoms ranged from bleeding ulcers to 
blacking out on the basketball floor, included Jerry Reynolds of the Sacramento 
Kings, Frank Layden of the Utah Jazz and Bernie Bickerstaff of the Seattle 
SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
All five have become victims in the last 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
Of the group, only Layden has quit, acknowledging that he has taken his last 
ride on the NBA "roller coaster." Ditka, Anderson, Reynolds and Bickerstaff 
have come back warier, although not necessarily for good. 
</P>
<P>
Still another coach, Bill Walsh of the San Francisco 49ers, has given up, too, 
citing, in part, the pressure of big-time coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"It almost consumes you," said Walsh, who retired at 57 after leading San 
Francisco to three of the last eight Super Bowl championships and then becoming 
an analyst for NBC Sports. "There were years when I was so enmeshed in my work 
that I lost energy -- lost the will to handle the job." 
</P>
<P>
To Raider Coach Mike Shanahan, stress is an NFL universal. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't just the head coaches who are (afflicted)," he said. "It's the whole 
staff, particularly the (offensive and defensive) coordinators. If you say you 
don't feel it, you aren't being honest with yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most widely publicized stress victim of the decade so far has been 
Dick Vermeil, who, when he resigned as coach of the Philadelphia Eagles in 
1983, popularized the word burnout as related to people, not rockets. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't see myself coaching again," Vermeil said recently. "For me, it was 
always first and 10. I lived in a state of continuous tension." 
</P>
<P>
Those with a sense of humor can sometimes joke about it. Said Marv Levy, coach 
of the Buffalo Bills: "I've noticed that burnout mainly affects the financially 
secure." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds, the Sacramento coach who collapsed on the court last December and lay 
senseless for six minutes, can even laugh at himself now. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to pass out again," he said the other day. "I might have to find 
a real job." 
</P>
<P>
But most of his peers, who remain concerned about Reynolds' blackout, aren't 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's scary, to be very honest with you," said John MacLeod, coach of the 
Dallas Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Bruce Ogilvie, a sports psychologist in San Jose, a 
well-adjusted, reasonably contented coach is usually one with realistic goals, 
a personal physical fitness program and a concerned family. 
</P>
<P>
"A person in a stressful job -- and coaching is about the worst -- needs to 
return to the warmth and shelter of a loving partner after the workday," 
Ogilvie said. 
</P>
<P>
"Stress is like a poison, and the pain and discomfort continue to build until 
you find a release. Running and swimming are good, but hardly anything is more 
important than a relationship with an attentive partner." 
</P>
<P>
A sports psychologist for 35 years, Ogilvie said that the NFL and the NBA have 
become the country's most traumatic places to coach, mostly because of the high 
expectations of changing ownerships in an era of increasingly high-priced 
franchises. 
</P>
<P>
"Big league coaches are subject to two kinds of pressure that don't much bother 
the rest of us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"First, the performance demands by owners, fans and the press are unreal. 
Making the playoffs is now a minimum requirement, and if you don't get there, 
regardless of how ordinary your players are, you're made to feel that your job 
is in jeopardy. That's a hell of a way to have to live. 
</P>
<P>
"Second, most NBA coaches and many in the NFL have been winners most of their 
lives, either as athletes or on (lower levels of coaching) or else they 
wouldn't be where they are. Suddenly they're in a situation where they can't 
win no matter what they do. 
</P>
<P>
"The result is a feeling of helplessness, anxiety, and pressure -- enormous 
pressure." 
</P>
<P>
The only antidote is finding a way to cope. 
</P>
<P>
Or as Ogilvie said: "You have to develop a defense. To go on living, you've got 
to drain the poison off by, say, running to exhaustion -- or, perhaps, by 
involving yourself closely in a caring family or with a loving wife." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "All creative people know pressure, of course." Many of them thrive 
when working against deadline pressures. 
</P>
<P>
"But the difference is that creative people in other (fields) aren't working in 
a crowded stadium or arena," he said. "They can hide. They can make a mistake 
or two without losing their job. For a coach, there's no place to hide -- and 
one wrong decision is career-threatening. That is real pressure." 
</P>
<P>
And so, stress lives on. Said Ogilvie: "A successful NBA coach told me this 
winter: 'We're all just waiting to be fired.' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BURNOUT PLAGUE FOR COACHES, NOT PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
The Detroit Pistons, who took the champion Lakers to seven games in last 
season's NBA finals, demonstrated this season that their 1988 performance was 
no fluke. They beat the Lakers in four games with a simple plan: 
</P>
<P>
 -- On defense, the Pistons took away whatever the Lakers could do best at any 
given time, continuing a procedure that had worked well against the Chicago 
Bulls' Michael Jordan, whom they had sometimes covered with as many as three or 
four players. Thus, Magic Johnson wasn't much of a factor against Detroit even 
before he was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On offense, the Pistons, with a surprisingly unsophisticated scheme, simply 
got the ball to the hot shooter. Theirs didn't seem to be a guard-oriented 
offense so much as a hot man's offense. 
</P>
<P>
But if any of this worried Magic, he gave no evidence of it. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly before reinjuring his weakened hamstring, the Laker guard, one of the 
most valuable athletes in L.A. sports history, was asked about his attitude 
toward an event as pressure-filled as an NBA championship series. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it," Johnson said. "Everyone should have a chance to trade places with 
me (when) every play counts . . . every shot counts." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's coach, Pat Riley, didn't see it that way at all. 
</P>
<P>
"I get a kick out of people who say (this) is fun," Riley said. "If you want to 
have fun, go to a Boys Club. I'm (here) to win." 
</P>
<P>
What is this? What accounts for such a conflict of attitudes toward a 
high-pressure event? 
</P>
<P>
"Responsibility," said Shanahan, the Raider coach. "The (pressure) load is 
incomparably heavier on the guy in charge. Burnout doesn't come from coaching. 
It comes from responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Pro athletes, by contrast, each accountable for himself only, are freer to 
enjoy a clutch moment -- as former Dodger Pedro Guerrero was saying the other 
day. 
</P>
<P>
"I love to go out there with the pressure of men on base," the St. Louis 
Cardinal first baseman said, adding: "There's pressure on the pitcher, too." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. And only managers are accountable for all of those pressured. 
</P>
<P>
The dividing line is between making and accepting decisions. In big league 
sports, a coach or manager has no choice but to make the game-time decisions 
that create the strain that raises their blood pressure, as a Humboldt State 
professor, Albert J. Figone, concluded in a recent paper. 
</P>
<P>
During one recent study, a basketball coach's pulse rate leaped from 75 beats a 
minute as the game started to 140 a few minutes later to a twice-normal 170 in 
a first-half crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to football coaching, Figone said: "The coach (must) demonstrate 
hard-boiled rationality (with) no signs of inaction or lack of good judgment in 
making decisions while at the same time (assuming) total responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"However, in reality, the coach's decisions often depend on influences such as 
injuries, officiating, amount of talent and other factors clearly beyond 
reasonable control." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, the coach is often stupendously uncertain, but must take a 
bold, macho stance nonetheless. The result: heavy stress. 
</P>
<P>
If anything bothers the players, cardiologist Richard Scott notes, they can go 
out and run it off. Activity is their relief. At the same time, the coach on 
the sideline, who can only watch, simply stews in his anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no satisfactory (game-time) outlet for (a coach's) stress," Scott 
said from Washington, D.C. "Coaching is a high-risk activity from a 
cardiovascular point of view." 
</P>
<P>
And it gets worse, Vermeil found. 
</P>
<P>
"Players get over losses much more quickly," he said. "They just suit up and 
play again. A coach has to live with failure." 
</P>
<P>
Every pro coach's problem, of course, is that somewhere out there, an owner is 
holding him responsible, regardless of who put his team together: a scout, the 
owner, or even the previous coach. 
</P>
<P>
Said San Jose State psychologist Thomas Tutko: "The most devastating position 
you can be in is with full responsibility but almost no control." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AMBITION, RECOGNITION, A NEED TO DOMINATE 
</P>
<P>
As a life style, is it more hazardous, more stressful, to coach basketball than 
football? 
</P>
<P>
It often seems so. In basketball, the coach is like an actor. He is the focus 
of the attention in a theater-sized arena. 
</P>
<P>
Football coaches operate in larger, less personal stadiums. If they can't hide, 
they can at least duck. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, most coaches seem to believe that one sport is as stressful as 
another. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic nature of the person -- not the sport -- has the most to do with 
their reaction to pressure," Levy said from Buffalo. "There are a lot of 
high-pressure jobs in this world. 
</P>
<P>
"Coaching isn't unique that way. What's unique is each individual, and I guess 
if you're unusually hyper, you're more subject to the strain of any job." 
</P>
<P>
It does seem, though, that burnout actually eliminates few coaches in any 
league, and almost no baseball managers. Even Sparky Anderson was out for only 
a few weeks this season. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of pressure in coaching, sure, and it can be a grind, but it's 
too good a life -- if you like it -- to walk away from," Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
"Over the years, I've discovered that it's more stressful not coaching than 
coaching." 
</P>
<P>
Levy, the NFL's only Phi Beta Kappa coach, added: "There are, as you know, 
great vicissitudes in this field. You win some that you should have lost, and 
you lose a few that you should have won, and you come to agree with John McKay 
that a genius is a guy who won last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact, I sometimes ask myself, 'Why am I doing this?' 
</P>
<P>
"But I get over it quickly. Very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
From San Jose, Ogilvie said: "That's a coach for you. The pressure is horrible, 
and still they hang in. 
</P>
<P>
"The good ones hang in because they're alike in three respects. 
</P>
<P>
"First of all, they're extraordinarily ambitious. They set surprisingly high 
goals for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"Second, they all thrive on recognition. They may be introverted, but they 
still hunger for recognition. 
</P>
<P>
"And third, they all have a strong need to control, to dominate." 
</P>
<P>
So they survive. For now. But at what price? What's the toll on the only hearts 
they'll probably ever have? 
</P>
<P>
At the Raider office, Shanahan said: "I've wondered about that. In this league, 
old coaches are eligible for pensions at 62 -- but how many coaches on a 
pension do you know? You've got to get there to get it." 
</P>
<P>
HOW TO COPE: HAVING FUN AND OTHER KEYS 
</P>
<P>
One definition of stress is: "Reaction to change; the adaptation of one's body 
and mind to any change." 
</P>
<P>
By that test, Ram Coach John Robinson is one of the best-adjusted individuals 
in football today -- or, probably, in any other sport or field. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson adapts, readily, to changes -- new players, associates, friends, 
opponents, reporters, to any football system or problem, to any situation -- 
even the loss of running back Eric Dickerson, probably the best in the game 
today. 
</P>
<P>
How does Robinson adapt to pressure? 
</P>
<P>
"The trick is to make football fun," he said, taking a somewhat unusual tack 
for a coach, one that sets him apart from Pat Riley and others who equate 
losing with dying. "You make sure you're getting your fair share of fun out of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"All jobs, of course, have negatives that wear you down if you let them. And 
you do have to deal with them. But you don't let the negatives outweigh the 
pleasures of the job." 
</P>
<P>
How do other coaches cope with possibly the biggest threat to their own 
happiness and well-being: the burden of stress? 
</P>
<P>
Count the ways: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nothing is more important than avoiding fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
That's Levy's line. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fatigue that dulls you, and makes you vulnerable to stress," he said. "So 
(Buffalo coaches) have a set leaving time. We're always out of here by 10 
(p.m.)." 
</P>
<P>
A 15-hour workday may seem excessive to a 9-to-5 person, but it's about the 
norm in football. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys who have trouble are the ones who work till 1 or 2 (a.m.), then get 
up at 5:30 and hurry back to the office," Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- You have to work at knocking out stress. 
</P>
<P>
That's from Ogilvie. 
</P>
<P>
"A coach must deliberately defend himself against (stress)," he said. "You 
can't just say, I'm not gonna let it bother me. 
</P>
<P>
"You need a regular, active program -- running or swimming, lifting (weights), 
biking, or playing tennis, anything that cuts quite heavily into your time, 
into your daily routine. 
</P>
<P>
"I know (an NBA) coach who, after every defeat, goes out into the night and 
runs eight miles. Runs to exhaustion. That keeps him quite sane and normal in 
his insane, abnormal world." 
</P>
<P>
Levy believes in running, too. 
</P>
<P>
"After every practice, I drop everything and run 20 minutes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Shanahan: "Just as you have to have a (physical training) program for your 
players, you need one for yourself. On a football team, the day is always 
divided into segments, and I block out a couple of segments for myself to run 
and lift (weights). 
</P>
<P>
"That gets you away from the pressure, away from the phone, makes you feel 
better about yourself, relieves the tension." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A concerned family is a coach's best conduit to stress reduction. 
</P>
<P>
The San Jose State psychologist, Tutko, said: "Above all, make time for your 
family. They're your support system." 
</P>
<P>
Said Vermeil: "The (other) people around a coach don't know how to give him 
support. They're there when he wins, but not when he loses, when he needs it 
most. Only his family can give him that kind of support." 
</P>
<P>
 -- A coach should always set realistic goals. 
</P>
<P>
"Loosen your collar," said Indiana Pacer Coach Dick Versace. "(You're) coaching 
a basketball game, not trying to get over terminal cancer." 
</P>
<P>
Said Ogilvie: "Don't let your fantasies dictate to you. Focus on the possible 
instead of a goal that might kill you anyway if you got there." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Don't worry. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to live my life to the fullest," Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz told 
writer John Nelson of Associated Press. "I'm not trying to abuse it, but I'm 
not going to worry about health. If you do, get out of coaching." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ignore your critics. 
</P>
<P>
In New York in 1983, after Knick Coach Hubie Brown was hospitalized because of 
a heart problem, he said: "There's far more pressure here than there was in 
Atlanta or Louisville. Seven dailies (newspapers) follow us regularly. 
</P>
<P>
"People think I'm heartless so I couldn't have a heart problem, but I'm a 
sensitive guy. I read, hell, I memorize, every word that's written about me." 
</P>
<P>
In New York in 1976, amid that kind of pressure, Holtz resigned in the last 
month of his first year as coach of the NFL's Jets, with three games left. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson? 
</P>
<P>
"You shouldn't get too concerned about what anybody says about you," Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Consult your friends. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't go it alone," said Walsh, whose 49er teams have won more games in the 
1980s than any NFL rival. "Talk things over with old friends or college 
classmates or a professional person. 
</P>
<P>
"You can bounce things off a sports psychologist. Not so much for his advice as 
for his counsel. Being able to just visit quietly with them or with good 
friends keeps down the turmoil." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Relax. 
</P>
<P>
After John Madden burned out in football, he finally settled down in another 
stressful field as an analyst. The difference? 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned to relax," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The late Ray Malavasi got that message long ago as coach of the Rams, when he 
once fell asleep while being interviewed by phone on his radio show. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Diet. 
</P>
<P>
"You keep adding to the stress if you try to eat on the run, as a lot of 
(coaches) have," said Levy. "Take your time over good food and not too much of 
it if you want your health and less stress." 
</P>
<P>
In that spirit, Washington Redskin Coach Joe Gibbs sits down with his 
assistants every night during the season to a nutritious, catered dinner that 
has three or four courses. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joke. 
</P>
<P>
After he blended an improper diet with fatigue and a heap of stress to bring on 
his collapse last winter during a Sacramento basketball game, Jerry Reynolds 
began staving off the next attack with Bob Hope-style one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I had a heart attack, but I knew that going out on a stretcher 
wasn't the right way to leave the arena," Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
"The good thing was, I was the first one out of the parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Delegate authority. 
</P>
<P>
Some coaches step up the pressure on themselves by failing to give their 
assistants a free hand, in the view of two Virginia teachers, C. J. Malone and 
R. J. Rotella. 
</P>
<P>
And, in the Journal of Physical Education not long ago, they wrote: "(Some 
coaches) prevent burnout by surrounding themselves with talented (assistants) 
who fill roles not easily filled by the head coach. (He) must be willing to 
give away responsibilities so assistants perceive themselves as valued and 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Revel in a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
"It must be an absorbing hobby, painting, chess, gardening -- anything 
demanding," Ogilvie said. "There's a hell of a lot more to life than sports." 
</P>

The thing that makes Jose Gonzalez laugh most these days is when somebody 
wonders why the Dodgers risk making a mere kid their everyday center fielder. 
</P>
<P>
Kid? Gonzalez may be 24 years old, but if he's a kid, then what does that make 
pitcher Orel Hershiser, who was signed by the Dodgers only one year before they 
signed Gonzalez? Or what does that make Dodger infielder Dave Anderson, who was 
signed the same year as Gonzalez? Or how about third baseman Jeff Hamilton, who 
was signed two years later? 
</P>
<P>
If he is a kid, then why does Gonzalez have all these scars? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gonzalez was playing for the Dodger organization at a time when he spoke no 
English, understood no English, and had one warm jacket. All of this made it 
difficult for a young man who was leaving the Dominican Republic for the first 
time in his 16 years, to begin his career in 1981 in the middle of Canada, 
playing for a rookie league team in Lethbridge. 
</P>
<P>
"That first year I got a bad reputation for falling asleep in team meetings," 
Gonzalez said. "But if you didn't understand what they were saying, wouldn't 
you fall asleep too?" 
</P>
<P>
His checks were cashed by his landlord. His food was ordered by friends. His 
batting average, in 34 games, was .136. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He didn't have a driver's license and had never even been behind the wheel 
of a car. 
</P>
<P>
This came up one night that first year in Lethbridge when his date, Mona 
Williams, decided she was tired and couldn't drive home. Gonzalez bravely took 
the wheel and was doing fine until it came time to turn left. 
</P>
<P>
As soon he made what seemed like a reasonable turn, a police car appeared in 
his rear view mirror and pulled him over. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you know how to use your turn signals?" the policeman asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Turn signals?" Gonzalez answered. "What are turn signals?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- He decided to marry Williams in 1984 in Bakersfield. But they had no money 
and no friends, so on a rare off day in April, they went to a wedding chapel 
and were married in front of two people. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, for their honeymoon, they ate Mexican food and drank cheap 
champagne. He was 19, she was 20. 
</P>
<P>
"In this family," Mona says, "we learn to go with the blows." 
</P>
<P>
 -- His skills were so raw that he needed to play winter league baseball in two 
places. In the winter of 1984 and 1985, he lived in the back of a woman's house 
in Santo Domingo. He would take a one-hour bus ride every day to San Pedro de 
Macoris to work out with other young prospects, then return in time to play for 
the Licey team at night. If there was time, the woman would cook him a late 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like the last nine years, I have played baseball every day of my 
life," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
The odyssey has paid off. In 36 games after his recall from triple-A 
Albuquerque, he has hit .297 and skillfully patrolled center field. His play 
has been enough to move him ahead of the slumping John Shelby as the Dodger 
center fielder. 
</P>
<P>
"We always knew he could field, but we can't believe how he's hitting," said 
one American League scout. "The thing is, we're all waiting to see if he keeps 
hitting." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez is waiting to see if he simply stays with the Dodgers. Not that he 
hasn't been here before -- he has been up off and on for the last four years. 
But always there was a string attached, a string that kept pulling him back and 
forth from the obscurity of the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
In 1984 he was recalled from double-A San Antonio in September for his major 
league debut. In 1985, he was recalled in September from triple-A Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, he was recalled from Albuquerque in July, sent back in August, and 
then recalled a week later. In 1987 he was brought up in September. 
</P>
<P>
Then came last season, when the Dodgers simply could not make up their minds. 
He was recalled to the Dodgers four times, once for only six days. 
</P>
<P>
"I always knew what flight to take to L.A., but last year was when I learned 
the name of the pilot," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Mona: "I'm surprised he hasn't gotten down with all that's happened. I'm 
surprised he hasn't said, 'This is bull.' " 
</P>
<P>
After finishing last year with the Dodgers in the World Series, he finally did 
say it, but in a different setting. The problem was with winter baseball, which 
he began playing a week after the World Series ended, playing for the eighth 
straight winter. 
</P>
<P>
"I went down there thinking I was no longer a rookie player, I was a major 
league player, I had worked really hard for the Dodgers," he said. "I was ready 
to be a Dodger." 
</P>
<P>
So when the Licey winter league team only offered him $1,000 a month, as 
contrasted with the normal $3,500 a month plus expenses given to Americans 
there, Gonzalez played a few weeks and quit. Their offer was average money for 
Dominican players, who are paid in pesos. But he felt he was finally worth more 
than average. 
</P>
<P>
"I work so hard, too hard for my winter team to treat me like that," Gonzalez 
said. "I've been around so long, I've got to start thinking about my future." 
</P>
<P>
It would be no big deal, many players leave their winter teams over money 
problems. Except the Dodgers had specifically requested that he play with 
Licey, and work on his hitting with Dodger coaches and Licey managers Bill 
Russell and Joe Ferguson, who split the season there. 
</P>
<P>
"We would never, ever force somebody to do what was against their will," said 
Fred Claire, Dodger vice president. "We just thought if Jose played, it would 
be good for both of us." 
</P>
<P>
Thus Gonzalez went to spring training rested, but troubled. 
</P>
<P>
"I wonder if the Dodgers got mad at me, I wonder if they have a chip against 
me," Gonzalez said. "I come to spring training and I worry that I'm in bad with 
them." 
</P>
<P>
"If we were mad at him," Claire said, "he wouldn't be where he is today." 
</P>
<P>
But he was still sent to Albuquerque on the last day of spring training. And he 
was only recalled June 2 because of Mike Marshall's back injury. And Dodger 
Manager Tom Lasorda greeted him with an ominous warning. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him when he came up, this may be his last chance," Lasorda said. "I 
told him I knew he could do it, but he had to show everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
In his first at-bat in Houston June 4, he tripled. The next day in Atlanta, he 
went one for one again. The next day, two for four. And the roll was on, capped 
one month later, on July 2 in Dodger Stadium, when he had a two-run homer and 
RBI double to give the Dodgers a 3-2 victory over Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, Gonzalez will tell you, he once was a kid. But now he is a Dodger. And he 
finally knows the difference. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Although he has the best pitching but worst hitting team in baseball, Dodger 
Vice President Fred Claire said Wednesday that the next roster shakeup will 
come in the pitching staff. "Everything is open to speculation at this point -- 
we are taking a close look at our pitching staff and may make an adjustment," 
Claire told reporters at a 90-minute workout at Dodger Stadium. The Dodgers 
play the St. Louis Cardinals at Dodger Stadium today at 5:05 p.m. Considering 
Tim Leary will not pitch in the four-game weekend series with the Cardinals, he 
is the probable victim of the 
</P>
<P>
shakeup. Look for him to be moved to the bullpen and Albuquerque's Ramon 
Martinez, who started in Wednesday night's triple-A All-Star game, to be called 
up and placed in the rotation for Monday's game against Chicago. In his only 
major league appearance this year, on June 5, Martinez threw a six-hit shutout 
against Atlanta. But the right-hander was only in the big leagues two days. If 
Leary moves to the bullpen, rookie John Wetteland might be sent down. Wetteland 
has allowed four runs in his last 8 1/3 relief innings. Leary has won only one 
of his last five starts, giving up 13 runs in 31 innings during that time (3.77 
ERA). . . . Look for Chris Gwynn, who was activated last week despite an 
inability to run on a broken right foot, to return to the disabled list when 
Mariano Duncan is eligible to return from his hamstring injury Sunday. . . . 
Longtime Dodger clubhouse manager Nobe Kawano has been hospitalized with 
pneumonia.

CLIPPERS' SEARCH ENDS AT BEGINNING AS CASEY IS REHIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clippers announced Wednesday that Don Casey, their interim coach of nearly 
six months, has become the full-time coach, ending a search that touched many 
fronts but eventually was resolved in-house. 
</P>
<P>
Casey signed a one-year deal, with the Clippers holding an option for the 
1990-91 season, to continue coaching the team he has guided since Gene Shue was 
fired on Jan. 19. He went 11-33 after taking over, including a 10-12 finish, 
which included wins over the Lakers, the Golden State Warriors and the Utah 
Jazz. It was that stretch and the support of his players that got Casey the 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say Casey is who all the guys wanted," said center Benoit Benjamin, 
one of Casey's biggest supporters. "He knows what it takes to relate to the 
younger players." 
</P>
<P>
Owner Donald T. Sterling established Casey, an assistant under three Clipper 
coaches and to Paul Westhead at Chicago, as the leading candidate for the job 
several weeks ago. He was kept on the payroll beyond his contract's July 1 
expiration date and remained an active part of the organization. He sat in on 
planning meetings for the recent draft and helped organize a team for the 
summer league. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Clippers were considering other options. They looked to 
the college ranks for Jim Valvano of North Carolina State, although serious 
talks never materialized. They looked to the pros for Mike Schuler, a former 
NBA coach of the year with Portland, who came in last Wednesday but the next 
day became a Warrior assistant. General Manager Elgin Baylor said there were 
others interviewed but declined even to say how many. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, they wanted to talk with Atlanta Coach Mike Fratello but never got 
permission from Stan Kasten, the Hawks' general manager. Kasten would not to 
confirm or deny the story. 
</P>
<P>
Casey's only wavering during the waiting was on an April trip to New Jersey, 
where he met with officials from Rider College about the vacancy there. His 
preference all along, however, was to stay with the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
The wish became a reality Wednesday. As Casey dined with friends Tuesday night, 
his attorney, Michael Goldberg, worked out contract details with Baylor and 
Andy Roeser, the team's executive vice president for business operations. The 
process moved quickly, and the agreement was made final Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"A key to the very smooth negotiations was the familiarity between the 
parties," Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
Casey is one of the senior members of the Clippers, having joined in 1983-84 as 
an assistant under Jim Lynam. He left after one season for a brief stint as 
head coach of Club Scalavini in an Italian pro league, and four months as a 
volunteer assistant at Notre Dame, but returned to the Clippers in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Casey's most recent season was one of twisting emotions. He was glad for the 
chance to coach in the NBA, but uncomfortable that the opportunity came at the 
expense of a friend such as Shue. He took over in the midst of a losing streak 
that would reach a franchise-record tying 19 games. 
</P>
<P>
"My feelings are of contentment, or relief that it (the wait to be named head 
coach) is over," said Casey, who spent nine years as head coach at Temple 
before going into the NBA. "I feel good about it. I'm using it as a plus that 
others were talked to and formally interviewed and I'm the one who's still 
here. They talked and they listened, and it's nice to think they went with me. 
They obviously liked what they saw at the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
While the Clippers were releasing the the news of Casey's hiring, he was 
already preparing for the season ahead. Soon after, he headed home to San Diego 
to help celebrate the 22nd birthday of daughter Leann, but is expected back at 
Clipper offices today. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a normal work day around here without any fanfare," the head coach, 
non-interim basis, said. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
A decision on the future of Don Casey's assistants, Jim Eyen and Joe Roberts, 
is forthcoming. . . . The Clippers' commitment to guard Reggie Williams, who 
ended the 1988-89 season on the suspended list for twice refusing to enter a 
game, has not changed since the end of the season. They protected him in the 
June 15 expansion draft, instead making Quintin Dailey, who started more games 
than any other guard last season, available, and more recently turned away 
trade opportunities. Seattle Coach Bernie Bickerstaff, one of Williams' biggest 
supporters, called before the June 27 college draft and made one of its two 
first-round choices available in exchange for the former No. 4 pick, but the 
Clippers refused. . . . Benoit Benjamin, who is open to offer sheets as a 
restricted free agent, has not picked an agent to replace Larry Fleisher, who 
died in May. Benjamin said he wants to stay with the Clippers and it is 
expected the team will match any offer sheets from other clubs. "It doesn't 
matter who it is," Benjamin said of his representative. "I'm in a situation 
where the ballclub knows they can't win much without me. I'm not trying to brag 
or anything, but I think it's been proven the better I play, the better the 
team goes." Bragging or not, he's right. 
</P>
<P>
There doesn't figure to be any movement regarding first-round draft choice 
Danny Ferry, possibly until August. Ferry, who has yet to select an agent, is 
on a post-graduation European vacation and is scheduled to speak at a 
basketball camp in Maryland after that. "For him to get away for a while is the 
best thing," said his coach at Duke, Mike Krzyzewski. . . . Maybe Ferry, who 
has given the appearance of being unhappy about being selected by the Clippers, 
saw trouble coming. Speaking at a press conference the week before being made 
the No. 2 pick, he said of the draft process: "I'm glad to be part of it, but I 
don't have any control. They dictate where the players go. I don't like it. I 
was able to pick Duke. This is the (pro) system. This is what I have to live 
by. I don't think it's fair. It's not the American way."

JIM MURRAY: HE SWITCHED LIGHTS ON IN KINGS' SURGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everyone knows how the inspired play of a great star, calling on all his 
remembered skills, turned around the Kings hockey team last season, turned them 
from the NHL version of Holiday On Ice to the most dangerous things on ice this 
side of the polar bear. 
</P>
<P>
You just have to hail this guy who went out and all but doubled his total in 
goals from a year earlier, who led his team (and almost his league) in goals, 
and who became only the fifth man in league history to score 70 goals in a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
By now you've guessed whom I'm talking about. Bernie Nicholls, of course. 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky? Who said anything about Wayne Gretzky? Come on. He had only 54 
goals, didn't he? 
</P>
<P>
Oh, I won't say Gretzky didn't help. His 168 points (goals plus assists) helped 
keep the opposition honest. But it was Bernie Nicholls who came in to light the 
red light 70 times. You can get two assists on a play. Goals come one to a 
customer. Assists are like the bunt in baseball. Goals are homers. 
</P>
<P>
The moral is that Bernie Nicholls is a considerable hockey player in his own 
right. Even in a game where trying to decapitate your opponent is called 
"misconduct," he holds his own. He once played the last half of a season with a 
broken jaw wired shut (in 1984). He couldn't talk but he could check. 
</P>
<P>
He was second in the league in goals-scored last season with 70 (Pittsburgh's 
Mario Lemieux was first with 85). He was fifth in total points. He was one of 
the main reasons the Kings led the NHL in goals (with 376). 
</P>
<P>
He was not the retiring type. He bashed 385 shots on goal in his 79 games last 
year. When Nicholls was around the net, the goalie thought it was raining 
pucks. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the Kings used to skate around the rink as if an organist were 
playing a Strauss waltz for them, and they were trying to get judges' 9s, 
Bernie Nicholls was a threat. He threw in 46 goals and 54 points in '84-'85. 
His 300 goals and 383 assists are third on the Kings' all-time list behind 
Marcel Dionne and Dave Taylor. They are nowhere near Wayne Gretzky's gaudy 
career totals (637 goals, 1,200 assists) but whose are? 
</P>
<P>
The renaissance of the Kings last season, from the Skater's Waltz to the 
Stanley Cup playoff games, was nowhere near as remarkable as the wake-up call 
Bernie Nicholls left -- from 32 goals to 70, from 46 points to 150, the biggest 
one-year increase in NHL history. 
</P>
<P>
The addition of a major threat to a lineup is well known in baseball as a boost 
to more than morale. It makes the hitters on both sides of him more dangerous. 
They see better pitches. When Roger Maris joined the New York Yankees, the most 
home runs he had hit in a season was 28. With Mickey Mantle hitting alongside 
him, he hit 61. (And Mantle hit 54.) Almost every great hitter had a sidekick 
to help him soften up the pitching -- Mantle-Maris, Mathews-Aaron, 
Gehringer-Greenberg. Pitchers can't pitch around a whole lineup. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Nicholls-Gretzky, the pattern is complicated. They are both 
centers. Thus, they are not on the ice at the same time (except in certain 
penalty-killing situations). No matter. When Gretzky is on the ice, it behooves 
the opposition to counter with its best defensive personnel. Nicholls does not 
exactly get the second string. But he does get, so to speak, good pitches to 
hit. As witness his 70 goals. 
</P>
<P>
It's not likely Wayne Gretzky will ever again be able to duplicate his 92-goal 
season of '81-'82. The league now assigns "shadows" to the great one. This is 
like walking Babe Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
But it is entirely possible 70 goals is only a beginning for Bernie Nicholls. A 
hyperactive strawberry blond who is not only in furious motion on ice but 
usually off it as well, Bernie has been on skates since he was in booties. His 
first pair of shoes had blades on the bottom. He could skate before he could 
walk, and as soon as the ponds froze over in his native Guilford, Ont. (about 
August 5 or so), little Bernie would be on them. The puck was a tennis ball, 
the sticks were cut down and taped rejects or even tree limbs. Since it gets 
dark in Guilford about noon in winter, Bernie played by the swaying light of 
two electric bulbs hitched to a car generator. If the lights ever get dim in 
the Forum next season, Bernie Nicholls will become the new Maurice the Rocket. 
</P>
<P>
He might anyway. He is already being hailed as a coming superstar. Sunday night 
at the Century Plaza, he shares a podium with the likes of Magic Johnson, Orel 
Hershiser, Tim Brown and Dick Butkus as athletes of the year in their sports at 
the fourth annual Sports Spectacular to benefit Cedars-Sinai Hospital. When you 
double your offensive output in a year, the least they can do is buy you 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
But the league may give him more than a trophy of his own next year. They may 
get him his very own shadow. And take their chances with Wayne What's-His-Name.

CANSECO GETS A NEW CAR, BREAKS IT IN WITH COUPLE OF QUICK SPEEDING TICKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
CASTRO VALLEY, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Oakland Athletics outfielder Jose Canseco, who has had a series of legal 
troubles behind the wheel, got a speeding ticket Tuesday while driving his new 
Porsche home to watch the All-Star game, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Canseco, alone in the white convertible that still had paper license plates, 
was pulled over and ticketed for driving 51 m.p.h. in a 35-m.p.h. zone, 
California Highway Patrol spokesman Nick Verhoek said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer who stopped him believed he was going over 65 m.p.h. on winding 
Crow Canyon Road through the East Bay foothills but couldn't get a radar 
reading, Verhoek added. 
</P>
<P>
"I got stopped for going 13 miles over the speed limit. Can you believe that?" 
Canseco said Wednesday at the Oakland Coliseum. When asked if he got a ticket, 
Canseco said, "Me? Not get a ticket?" 
</P>
<P>
The speeding ticket was Canseco's second in the new car on Crow Canyon Road, 
near his home in San Ramon. 
</P>
<P>
The ticket carries a fine of $50 to $100 that must be paid in 30 days, 
according to the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
In February, Canseco was ticketed in Florida for driving 125 m.p.h. in his 
$75,000 red Jaguar. 
</P>
<P>
In March, while in Arizona for spring training, he was ticketed again for 
speeding in the same car. A's management suggested that it might be time to 
trade the car for something less noticeable. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, Canseco was arrested by campus police at University of 
California at San Francisco for investigation of having a loaded weapon in the 
Jaguar.

USC football Coach Larry Smith named Mike Sanford an assistant coach in charge 
of wide receivers. Sanford, a 1978 graduate of USC, had been the quarterback 
and receivers coach at Purdue since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
While at USC, Sanford, 34, was a reserve quarterback and safety for the 
Trojans, before becoming a graduate assistant to John Robinson in 1977. From 
'77 to '87, he coached at Virginia Military Institute, Cal State Long Beach, 
Army and San Diego City College.

SLOWER THAN BURNOUT, IT'S EXPIRATION DATE FOR EFFECTIVENESS

<P>
Burnout isn't the only affliction that pushes professional coaches into 
retirement prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
There's also lassitude, Raider executive Al LoCasale said the other day. 
</P>
<P>
"Nine or 10 years are about as long as any pro coach can operate at top 
efficiency," LoCasale said. "After that, most of them find that they're better 
off moving out. 
</P>
<P>
"They aren't burned out, exactly. They just can't do it any more -- not the way 
they want to do it, not the way they used to do it." 
</P>
<P>
This is a theory first advanced by Raider owner Al Davis. The theory gained 
more credibility a few months ago when Bill Walsh ended 10 years as coach of 
the San Francisco 49ers by resigning after his third Super Bowl triumph. At 57, 
Walsh is now an football analyst for NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, John Madden and Tom Flores had both left the Raiders after a decade or 
so as coach, and after each had won the Super Bowl at least once. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, the late Vince Lombardi left the Green Bay Packers after winning two 
Super Bowls in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard for a pro coach to maintain the level of his enthusiasm for more 
than a decade," LoCasale said. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been motivating many of the same players all that time. They've heard 
all his lines and all his funnies -- over and over, probably. Most players get 
to where they can even impersonate a veteran coach nicely at parties. 
</P>
<P>
"After 10 years or so, the coach has given all of himself that there is. He's 
generated the best results he can get. When the time comes to put it into third 
gear, he discovers that third gear isn't there any more." 
</P>
<P>
The famous exceptions are Don Shula, who has been coaching pro teams for a 
quarter-century, lately at Miami, and Chuck Noll, who has led the Pittsburgh 
Steelers all that time. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Landry led the Dallas Cowboys for 29 years until a new owner fired him this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
However, the league's three senior coaches have all hovered around .500, if 
that. The Dolphins were 6-10 last year, the Steelers 5-11, the Cowboys an 
NFL-worst 3-13. Landry's last three teams were losers. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, however, neither Noll, Shula nor Landry seemed close to burning out.

GLUT OF FILM HITS HAS EXHIBITORS REELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this, the hottest summer in movie history, America's theater owners and 
operators are discovering that there can be too much of a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
With a block of solid hits dominating almost half of the country's 24,000 
theater screens, and setting a pace that will shatter all Hollywood box office 
records, exhibitors are giving themselves headaches trying to decide which 
films to leave on their screens and which to take off. 
</P>
<P>
The decision is not as arbitrary as it seems. Exhibitors who pull films from 
theaters before their contractual commitments face penalties and studio 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a problem that occurs when pictures continue to have strong legs," said 
John Krier, president of Los Angeles-based Exhibitor Relations. "That means 
that they might have been booked for a certain period of time, but because of 
the volume of business, the run has to be extended." 
</P>
<P>
"This is happening all over the country," said Salt Lake City buyer and booker 
David Sharp. "These blockbusters are smacking into each other left and right. 
One major studio wants you to hold, another wants you to open. It's very 
difficult to reach a compromise. . . . Somebody wins and somebody loses in 
every market. Whoever pushes the hardest wins." 
</P>
<P>
When Disney's "Peter Pan" alights on 1,450 screens Friday, it will join two 
surprise Disney/Touchstone pictures already in release that continue to baffle 
industry experts. The family film "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids," now in its third 
week, trailed only "Lethal Weapon 2" and "Batman" in last weekend's box-office 
race, grossing $9.4 million. And after seven weeks in release, "Dead Poets 
Society" is still very much alive. It has combined with "Honey, I Shrunk the 
Kids" to earn Disney more than $115 million. 
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult when a studio starts commanding too many national tracks," said 
Mike Ogrodowski, senior booker for Marcus Theaters in Milwaukee. "Paramount, 
Warners and Disney all have two tracks . . . and now 'Peter Pan' is opening. 
That's three tracks for Disney. In a lot of towns you have to take off a 'Dead 
Poets' to play a 'Peter Pan.' Or delay a 'Peter Pan' to keep on 'Dead Poets.' " 
</P>
<P>
"The question becomes: Can we maintain our screens?" said Phil Barlow, general 
sales manager of Buena Vista, Disney's distribution arm. "If you look, we're 
edging up. 'Dead Poets' is gradually increasing -- it was never our goal to be 
on 1,100 screens simultaneously with 'Dead Poets.' The one thing most 
exhibitors know is that you just don't mess around with success on the gamble 
that another film will do better." 
</P>
<P>
"Peter Pan," backed by Disney's solid box-office projections based upon the 
last re-release of the film, has already delayed James Bond from stepping onto 
one screen in the small market of Glenwood Springs, Colo. Friday's scheduled 
release of MGM/UA's "Licence to Kill" has been pulled because "all the pictures 
on the screen were too strong to take off," theater booker David Sharp said. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Batman' is playing on one screen and 'Lethal Weapon' on the second. The 
third screen has 'Ghostbusters' and 'Karate Kid,' which were stacked together 
to get 'Lethal Weapon' on last week. 'Peter Pan' opens this Friday, and it 
effectively leaves Bond out in the lurch." 
</P>
<P>
Insiders predict that the big showdown will occur in two weeks, when Disney 
opens "Turner and Hooch," starring comedy superstar Tom Hanks and a drooling, 
180-pound dog. Exhibitors say the film's trailer is playing exceptionally well 
in theaters and the one-stop advertising board in lobbies is drawing lots of 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
Exhibitors from larger, overscreened markets with multiplex theaters say the 
Disney squeeze should not cause severe scheduling conflicts because their films 
can usually be shuffled to smaller screens to oblige commitments to studio 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
"If we our able to hold our screens, does it affect the other guys?" said 
Disney's Barlow. "Yes. It might mean that 'Great Balls of Fire' doesn't get a 
third week. That may be unfortunate for Orion. But it all evens out. No one can 
predict with any great accuracy ahead of time what anyone else will do. There's 
a tendency for pictures that have been overestimated for what they are supposed 
to do to make room for pictures that were underestimated." 
</P>
<P>
Helping to ease the crunch are several films that did not meet studio 
expectations at the box office. Columbia placed high hopes in its tandem of 
"Ghostbusters II" and "The Karate Kid III," but the films are at a summer's-end 
pace that will earn them less than half of what their predecessors grossed at 
the box office. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Great Balls of Fire,' 'Roadhouse,' 'Renegades,' 'Pink Cadillac' -- many 
thought (those films) were going to play longer, and they did not," said Chan 
Wood, Pacific Theaters head film buyer. "There will be a number of important 
films opening late July, early August. By the time we get to them there will be 
pictures coming off the screen to make room." 
</P>
<P>
Ushering films into theaters involves a complex set of moves and negotiations 
in which the studio holds most of the keys. One film buyer called it a 
"seller's market," and said that a studio once threatened to withhold its 
product if he did not comply with the studio's demands. 
</P>
<P>
In negotiating for booking of major-studio movies, exhibitors commit to keep a 
film playing as long as it is performing above a predetermined level of 
business. The conflict occurs when the run of one studio's film is extended 
beyond the opening date of another studio's release. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibitor who backs out of a film early is typically required to pay a 
penalty or a percentage of box-office receipts. To avoid this trap, some 
exhibitors engage in an illegal practice known as "double booking." 
</P>
<P>
"You do it on the sly," said one industry source who asked not to be 
identified. "If you book a 'Great Balls of Fire' and have no faith in the 
picture -- and sign a contract for six weeks -- you might have a new film 
penciled in at Week Four. But you don't tell the distributor of 'Great Balls of 
Fire.' Then you wait and keep your fingers crossed so you can call the 
distributor and say, 'Your film is weakening. I have to take it off.' 
</P>
<P>
"That's what the smart booker does. All the time he has another film to put 
in." 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the scramble caused by Disney's two surprise summer hits is the 
fact that the summer is less than half over and there are several potential 
hits on the way. Among the candidates: Columbia's romantic comedy "When Harry 
Met Sally . . . " starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan; Universal's domestic 
comedy "Parenthood" with Steve Martin; Fox's underwater science-fiction 
thriller "The Abyss" directed by James Cameron, and Tri-Star's serving of 
Sylvestor Stallone in the prison drama "Lock-Up." 
</P>
<P>
"There's a balance of intelligence in the exhibition community that is going to 
hold onto the good pictures," Disney's Barlow said. "Now, (Disney) is certainly 
the beneficiary of that. There are times when we've been the victim of that. 
There's some pressure -- you're doggone right there's some pressure -- but 
we're not feeling it right now. We've felt it in the past, and we'll feel it in 
the future."

USA CABLE NETWORK'S POTPOURRI PROGRAMMING STYLE IS PAYING OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
The network's schedule ranges from reruns of "Murder, She Wrote" and "Miami 
Vice" to original series such as "The Hitchhiker" and "The Ray Bradbury 
Theater." There are world-premiere TV movies and such non-classic oldies as 
"Cave Girl" and "Horror of the Werewolf." Children can find such cartoons as 
"She-Ra, Princess of Power" and "Magilla Gorilla," while sports fans can find 
early-round action of such events as the U.S. Open tennis tournament and golf's 
Masters Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
While other cable networks have carved out niches for themselves by 
specializing in one area -- ESPN in sports, CNN in news, MTV in music -- USA 
has done just the opposite, providing a mix of programming that is almost as 
diverse as that on a typical independent TV station. Almost, because USA 
doesn't do news. 
</P>
<P>
The reason goes to the heart of USA's programming philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"To do a really good job at news is expensive, and remember, we're 
counter-programmers," explains Kay Koplovitz, president of the USA Network. "We 
think that during the news block (of our rivals), we can do better with other 
program formats." 
</P>
<P>
Neither Koplovitz nor her cable network are anywhere as well known outside the 
television industry as, say, CBS and its Broadcast Group chief, Howard 
Stringer, or NBC and its top programmer, Brandon Tartikoff. 
</P>
<P>
But her network, which has 215 employees and is jointly owned by Paramount and 
MCA, is one of cable's biggies, having steadily, if quietly, grown since its 
birth in 1977 as the Madison Square Garden Network. Koplovitz, who has worked 
in the cable industry since 1968, came aboard in 1980 when the venture was 
renamed USA Network. 
</P>
<P>
Sports-oriented ESPN remains the leader of the cable pack, reaching 57% of the 
nation's 90.4 million TV homes. It is followed closely by Ted Turner's all-news 
CNN and his Atlanta superstation, WTBS. Koplovitz' a-little-bit-of-everything 
empire ranks fourth overall in the latest A.C. Nielsen report, just four 
percentage points behind ESPN in the number of homes served. 
</P>
<P>
A Milwaukee native, Koplovitz, 44, briefly worked as a producer at WTMJ-TV 
after graduating from the University of Wisconsin. But she wanted to go into 
this then-new thing called cable -- and on the management side, not production. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I would get a good opportunity in broadcasting," she said 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
The old-boy, no-women network? 
</P>
<P>
"Yes. I think it was quite apparent," she said. "This was 18 years ago . . . 
and I thought I would have a better opportunity in an environment where things 
were changing." 
</P>
<P>
When she got a master's degree at Michigan State, she recalled with a slight 
smile, her thesis concerned satellite technology and "the political 
ramifications of cross-cultural communications." 
</P>
<P>
When she wrote her thesis, she added, "I believed that the technology would 
prompt a change in (program) distribution. . . . For me, fortunately, it worked 
out perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
Koplovitz began last season by announcing a $250-million package of original 
series and 24 made-for-USA movies that would join its schedule. The TV movies 
have been aired on a monthly basis, but will be shown twice a month this fall, 
starting in October. 
</P>
<P>
There will be more announcements in Los Angeles today, where she is scheduled 
to speak to visiting TV writers. One is that USA has bought rerun rights for 
"The Equalizer," which CBS axed this spring after four seasons. It will air 
weekly beginning Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Koplovitz also will announce, sources say, another megabuck outlay -- at least 
as much as this year's program expenditure -- for original series and another 
24 made-for-USA movies for next year. 
</P>
<P>
The premiere last April of USA's first original movie, "The Forgotten," was 
seen, by USA's estimate,in nearly 1.8 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
The ratings were more than twice what USA had previously gotten in that 
Wednesday night time slot, the network said -- and the May and June TV films 
did even better. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, in the week that "The Forgotten" aired, the lowest-rated show on one 
of the three major networks was seen in more than 4.1 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
USA research vice president David Bender's response to that fact is a cheerful 
admission: Yes, cable's ratings aren't as high as those of the networks. 
However, he contends, USA has better audience demographics -- its viewers are 
more upscale and thus more attractive to advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
Koplovitz thinks that "somewhere down the line in the mid-'90s, there'll be 
more parity (with the networks) than we've ever seen" in ratings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're going in that direction," she said. But she added an important 
qualifier: The parity, should USA come to it, won't be in all or even most of 
the 22 hours of prime-time programming a week. 
</P>
<P>
Rather, she said, "on the individual movie, series or project, we may be 
talking about the ability to compete head to head. The gap is closing faster 
than I thought (possible) in some regards." 
</P>
<P>
The current original-movie package includes three films based on espionage 
stories by best-selling author Frederick Forsyth ("Day of the Jackal"). The 
first, "Just Another Secret," starring Beau Bridges as a CIA operative 
embroiled in an assassination plot, is scheduled to air in December. 
</P>
<P>
All three films are co-production deals with Blair Entertainment, London 
Weekend Television and Taurus Films, a German company.

HOUSE CHASTISES ARTS ENDOWMENT WITH $45,000 CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI SILVER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After an emotional debate over the value of public funding for controversial 
art, the House voted Wednesday to cut a slap-on-the-wrist $45,000 from the 
budget of the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
The House's action comes as the latest development in a furor over arts 
endowment grants for two exhibits: a show of photographs, some with homoerotic 
and sexually explicit themes by late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, and a 
traveling art show that included an Andres Serrano photograph of a crucifix 
dipped in urine. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) asked for the cuts as a "symbolic gesture" to 
punish the endowment for funding the Mapplethorpe and Serrano projects. The cut 
equals the combined amount of the two grants. 
</P>
<P>
Many lawmakers voted for the cuts in order to kill one amendment that would 
have deleted more than $14 million from the endowment's budget and another 
amendment that endeavored to kill the endowment's entire budget of $171 
million. 
</P>
<P>
The House Appropriations Committee recently recommended a $2.3-million increase 
in the arts endowment's budget, bringing the total to $171.4 million next year. 
</P>
<P>
In a debate that crossed party lines, some congressmen questioned whether the 
budget cuts amounted to government censorship of artists, while others said 
that the public had a right to withhold funding from "objectionable" artwork. 
</P>
<P>
Calling controversial artworks "a outrageous use of taxpayer's funds," 
California Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), who tried to kill the endowment's 
entire budget, said, "I believe censorship is not the solution. The answer is 
getting government out of the arts." 
</P>
<P>
But Rohrabacher's attempts were soundly rejected by a bipartisan coalition, 
lead by House Appropriations Chairman Rep. Sidney Yates (D-Ill.). "Every 
civilized country in the world subsidizes the arts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A more serious challenge to the endowment's budget came from Rep. Dick Armey 
(R-Tex.), who offered an amendment to delete $14 million from the budget to 
deliver "a severe slap on the wrist for an agency that has severely defaulted 
on its responsibility to the American people" for funding the Mapplethorpe 
photographs and Serrano's "Piss Christ." 
</P>
<P>
Anne Murphy, executive director of the American Arts Alliance, called the 
outcome "a major victory, considering what the proposals on the floor were." 
She said she had not been concerned that the proposal by Rohrabacher to cut out 
all funding for the national endowment would prevail. But she said arts 
observers were seriously worried when debate began Wednesday morning that 
Armey's attempt to cut funding by 10% would be successful. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's been a major showing of support for the arts on the House 
floor," Murphy said. She said the symbolic $45,000 budget cut proposed by 
Stenholm reflected the fact that "Congress obviously felt a need to send a 
message that being careful is in order." In debate on the various amendments, 
Stenholm characterized his approach as a "shot across the bow" of the 
endowment, while other congressmen criticized Armey's approach as "a direct hit 
on the bridge." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the dispute, Armey threatened to drum up support for a $6-million 
budget cut by taking the Mapplethorpe pictures to the floor of the House to 
shock members of Congress into voting his way. 
</P>
<P>
Armey and his colleagues brandished the Mapplethorpe catalogue on the floor of 
the House Wednesday, but declined to show the pictures -- decried in terms 
ranging from "filth" to "pornography" -- to the congressmen assembled. 
</P>
<P>
However, congressmen voted 356-68 for the lesser cuts in the endowment's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Southern, the national endowment's acting chairman, said the agency was 
"pleased at this bipartisan vote of confidence" that "strongly confirms the 
federal government's commitment for support to the arts throughout the United 
States." 
</P>
<P>
Southern said the endowment believes the House action "reflects the views of 
most Americans that the public-private partnership in support of the arts has 
been enormously successful." He added that the symbolic, $45,000 budget cut was 
a serious reminder of "congressional concerns about endowment procedures." 
"Ultimately, all of these amendments take a piece out of American -- that is, 
freedom of expression," said Rep. Ted Weiss (D-N.Y.), urging that all the 
amendments be voted down because they were a form of censorship. 
</P>
<P>
Yates requested that debate over the role of the endowment be resumed when the 
Congress considers whether the agency should be re-authorized later in the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Backed by conservative Sens. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.) and 
Slade Gorton (R-Wash.), Armey has demanded in recent weeks a written guarantee 
that the endowment deny federal funds to artwork that "would be blatantly 
offensive to the vast majority of the American people." 
</P>
<P>
When the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington canceled the Mapplethorpe show 
last month, hoping to avoid a political controversy, the move only heightened 
the controversy. Subsequently, the Washington Project for the Arts picked up 
the Mapplethorpe exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Both arts endowment staffers and congressmen supportive of NEA have worked in 
past weeks to defuse the controversy by offering proposals to change the 
endowment's procedure of allocating grants. 
</P>
<P>
But Armey rejected the endowment staffers' proposal to re-emphasize standards 
of creative excellence in awarding endowment grants, and he was not dissuaded 
by the House Appropriations Committee's alteration of the endowment's process 
of awarding grants. 
</P>
<P>
Spearheaded by Rep. Sidney Yates, (D-Ill.), the committee directed the National 
Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities to approve 
all grants allocated by intermediary organizations, which receive large blocks 
of federal funds to parcel out to individual recipients. 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the intermediary organizations can award grants without prior 
approval from the main organization. Armey responded through a spokesman that 
the measure was "constructive," but "we still have a way to go in addressing a 
solution." 
</P>
<P>
On July 8, Bush appointed John E. Frohnmayer as chairman to the beleaguered 
organization, which has remained leaderless since February. The nomination 
requires Senate confirmation.

RECYCLERS SUDDENLY IN A HIGH CYCLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gary Petersen's Santa Monica business address -- No. 1 Recycle Way -- is 
perfectly appropriate for a company that collects, separates and ships cans, 
bottles, paper and other household throwaways to processing mills. What the 
address doesn't indicate is the current phenomenal success enjoyed by Petersen, 
who started in the recycling business 17 years ago with $2 (for gas) and a 
Volkswagen bus, from which he knocked on doors to solicit subscribers for his 
pickup service. 
</P>
<P>
By the time Petersen's company was bought last April -- by Waste Management 
Inc., the largest waste-hauling company in the world -- it was recycling 2,000 
tons of material a month, and Petersen had helped design a cluster of buy-back 
centers, drop-off centers, curbside collections and other programs that make 
the City of Santa Monica's recycling program one of the most comprehensive in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, at age 41, after going into recycling primarily because he 
believed in the cause, Petersen finds himself the seasoned veteran of a 
"career" whose practitioners are so in demand that supply can't even begin to 
keep up with it. 
</P>
<P>
Pricked by the sight of their own overflowing garbage, and suddenly aware of 
the need to reform the nation's staggering yearly throwaway habit 
(approximately 150 million tons a year), private citizens and public officials 
are reconsidering recycling -- or perhaps seriously considering it for the 
first time -- as a solution to the garbage glut. In the process, help wanted 
ads and college catalogues list an expanding array of new jobs, many under the 
unglamorous designations of waste management or waste utilization. 
</P>
<P>
"The field of recycling has just exploded in the last year," said Petersen, 
whose company, Ecolo-Haul, had clients all over the nation. "It is incredible 
in putting people to work, both in blue- and white-collar areas." 
</P>
<P>
A national specialist, Neil Seldman, director of waste utilization at the 
Institute for Local Self-Reliance in Washington, reports that not only are the 
jobs mushrooming, but so is the pay. "Right now, I know of two solid waste 
recycling coordinators who are getting paid $50,000," he said last week. "Three 
years ago, they were making less than $15,000." 
</P>
<P>
The cause of this spectacular acceleration? Essentially, Seldman said, it's the 
problem of where to throw the trash -- as the nation's landfills slowly fill 
up, and new landfills and incinerators become increasingly difficult to 
develop. "Cities are spending a lot of money to keep materials outside the 
landfills and the way they do it is to hire recycling coordinators," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Not incidental to the growing problem, Seldman will be a speaker at an Aug. 6-8 
recycling conference in Arcata, Calif., a woodsy town near the Oregon border. 
Titled "Preparing for the 1990s: A West Coast Summit," the event is expected to 
attract about 400 participants, including state and local officials, who will 
spend three days immersed in workshops, legislative reports and action plans. 
And although this is the California Resource Recovery Assn.'s 13th annual 
conference, almost everyone agrees this one is special. 
</P>
<P>
After years of preaching and practicing "recycle" while no one listened and 
cities continued to dump and burn their trash, seasoned recyclers show every 
sign of coming into their own. 
</P>
<P>
Confirms Margaret Gainer of Arcata, a recycling consultant who is coordinating 
the conference: "The recycling 'movement' is now the recycling industry. It's 
in the mainstream. There are a lot of new businesses starting up; there is a 
lot of entrepreneurship at work. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were entering college today," Gainer said, "I would look into an 
educational curriculum that would train me in waste utilization management. 
It's a very future-oriented career." 
</P>
<P>
So new is the field, and so sudden the clamor for practitioners, that veteran 
recyclers -- who often refer to themselves as "environmental economists" -- 
usually have to explain what it is they do. As they patiently note, picking up 
the trash is only part of the equation. The recycling process is not complete 
until the recovered material has been made back into a new product and sold. 
The nuts and bolts of this recovery-reuse cycle is what Seldman's Institute for 
Local Self-Reliance teaches when local governments and private businesses come 
to them seeking a way out of the landfill trap. 
</P>
<P>
Explained Seldman: "We help them transform their garbage system into a 
recycling system, then help build factories to take the recycled materials and 
make new products out of them." 
</P>
<P>
He cited some examples: An Oakland factory that sterilizes wine bottles and 
re-sells them to the wine industry, a Fresno company that manufactures 
cellulose insulation from old newspapers, and a Minnesota plant that transforms 
old tires into industrial roofing, flooring and a whole variety of rubber 
products. 
</P>
<P>
"We call that the 'pot of gold at the end of the garbage rainbow,' " said 
Seldman. "That's where the profits are." 
</P>
<P>
This optimistic outlook is a welcome turnaround, industry veterans say, mostly 
people in their early 40s who have been maintaining a tenuous hold at best on 
their careers. For the most part they are people, such as Petersen, who got 
into recycling because they loved the environment and were willing to work for 
next to nothing because they believed in what they were doing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'It's Really Been a Struggle' 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in this business for 17 years, and it's really been a struggle," 
said Dan Cotter, vice president and general manager of West Coast Salvage &amp; 
Recycling Co. in San Francisco. Typically, he started on a shoestring, setting 
up a community recycling center in Arcata. "Recycling centers were an outgrowth 
of the first Earth Day in 1969. We were environmentalists, and all of us 
struggled very hard through the years." 
</P>
<P>
An early-day recycler not only drove the truck and kept the books, but also 
swept the floor and made the coffee, Cotter said. "It was hand to mouth. We 
called ourselves 'recyclers,' kind of coining the word. The people before us 
were in the salvage business, and before that the term used was junkman." 
</P>
<P>
His business has grown from 13 to 80 employees in the last two years, he said. 
"We were rediscovered, almost overnight, and pushed into prominence. There's a 
tremendous demand for people, and very little expertise out there." 
</P>
<P>
That observation is repeated throughout the industry. "We're conducting a 
massive talent search," said Richard Gertman of R.W. Beck &amp; Associates, an 
engineering and design consulting firm that works with cities across the 
country on utility projects. 
</P>
<P>
Gertman is a materials recovery specialist, which is, in short, a recycler. He 
recently joined Beck's San Jose office, working with California's city, county 
and state government agencies designing projects that range from recycling 
plants to compost programs for the leaves, tree clippings, grass and shrubbery 
that make up a third of an average city's residential waste. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in the field since 1970 (he started as a college student volunteer 
recycling newspapers) and a lot of things have been happening recently. There 
has been an explosion in state legislation -- more than 2,000 bills have been 
introduced nationwide focused on the problem of solid waste. Clearly this 
creates a need for people," Gertman said. But potential jobs spring from a 
wider area than just recycling, Gertman added. 
</P>
<P>
Not only those with science and engineering backgrounds are needed, he said, 
but the field is looking for writers who can do public relations, for teachers 
to do curricula education guides, for sociologists to survey recycling data and 
psychologists to study recycling habits among other specialties. Marketing and 
sales of recycled products provide more employment opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
"Something is happening in every area," he said. "All across the country there 
are job openings and a new emphasis on recycling." 
</P>
<P>
"It was the garbage barge," he added, that really raised our consciousness. The 
1987 saga of the barge that left New York loaded with trash and spent six 
months at sea, being rejected by six states and three nations, dramatized the 
dwindling landfill situation in a unique way, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It brought attention to recycling -- that was exciting in what it led to," he 
added. That will be the theme of the August conference in Arcata. "We want to 
plan for the '90s, talk about the next generation," said Richard Anthony, 
president of CRRA. Anthony is solid waste program manager for the County of San 
Diego, which has one of the nation's most comprehensive programs. 
</P>
<P>
A major issue, he said, will be developing incentives for both government and 
private companies to buy recycled products. "Recycling wasn't even in the 
dictionary 20 years ago and today it's one of our common buzzwords," he said. 
"Our program was funded last August and I'm looking for a staff of 12, and 
can't find people to do it. I'm going to advertise for three recycling 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a great field to get into -- a chance to understand how the Earth 
works." 
</P>

AFTER 44 YEARS IN THE RING, CIRCUS CHAMP GUNTHER GEBEL-WILLIAMS TAKES A 
CIRCUITOUS ROUTE TO RETIREMENT 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is a public farewell that has developed into the most protracted, most 
visible goodby since Douglas MacArthur left the Army. 
</P>
<P>
The end began last year with a circus matinee in Venice, Fla. It will continue 
through this year until November next year and the absolutely final show in 
Pittsburgh. That's 300 au revoir performances to date with 1,000 to go before 
tigers cease snarling at, and crowds stop gasping admiration for, animal 
trainer Gunther Gebel-Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Blond, cocky, acrobat-built Gebel-Williams, 54, became a circus man 44 years 
ago. He blinked. Now his career is over. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shows Added Up Quickly 
</P>
<P>
"Fast, ja, very fast," he says. There is a sigh and surprise at just how fast. 
"Yesterday, when somebody said this was 11,000 shows in America, I thought, 
mein Gott, I was doing this for 25 years before in Germany and there, every 
week, 14 shows and never have I the slightest idea how many times I perform." 
</P>
<P>
But now he does. Now each performance, every city is a tick toward his final 
exit standing on Congo, the bull elephant who has been with Gebel-Williams for 
two generations. San Diego this week. Anaheim next week. Then Long Beach and 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I ride out I say: 'That's another one . . . bye-bye,"' he said. "So 
maybe, with every day being a last day, it will be a little easier at the end." 
</P>
<P>
But it won't. Gebel-Williams knows it. Four decades of staring down 400-pound 
Bengal tigers is less frightening than looking square at retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"I will feel terrible for sure," he said. The accent is Boris Becker's and 
littered with charming misusages. "I hope at final show I have nothing to say 
ever to nobody and maybe I won't have to go to the microphones and say all 
these thank yous. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to run out and go into the street and sit on a corner and nobody 
have to see me. Because I'll cry. For sure. I try to be a very tough guy all my 
life but this is a lifetime splitting." 
</P>
<P>
It is Sunday amid six performances in two days, a grind that circus performers 
call a six-pack weekend. The Phoenix Suns have moved out of their Memorial 
Coliseum, and Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus has moved in. 
</P>
<P>
It is an appropriate place for Gebel-Williams to talk about his life, his 
animals, circuses and performers, what they were and what they have become. 
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, the circus, this Roman root of pure show business, was the Big Top 
and two-night stands in small towns, center rings and sawdust and acts that 
spoke three European languages fluently and a little Serbo-Croatian. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey shows touch mostly 
air-conditioned arenas in big cities and no Ringlings, Barnums or Baileys 
remain alive. There are three rings but no identification of "center ring" 
because that implies a superiority that has been known to upset contract 
negotiations with performers. 
</P>
<P>
A kid who runs away to the circus these days will be turned over to juvenile 
hall. There are health controls, dependent education, public relations, 
insurance and Cleveland Amory to worry about. Sawdust is used only to cleanse 
and camouflage animal accidents in public. 
</P>
<P>
Gebel-Williams has lived both eras. Sometimes, he says, it feels like it has 
been forever. It certainly has precluded a normal life and standard 
trivialities such as vacations, 40-hour work weeks, mowing lawns and watching 
"Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
"No time for nothing," he says. "You come here in the morning, make shows, 
enjoy what you are doing and make sure the audience enjoys it and . . . poof, 
gone, another day. 
</P>
<P>
"Then rush to the next town. Then one day you say you have to stop because you 
forgot to live." 
</P>
<P>
He is 54 and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is 42 and Gordie Howe was 52 and Willie 
Shoemaker will soon be 58, but there is no comparison between retirements. 
</P>
<P>
"Because everybody else has a season," he says. "A great football player, a 
great basketball player . . . they all have time off. But I make this every day 
of the year, always 16 hours a day, and I never take a vacation." 
</P>
<P>
Still, that is only a portion of his decision to retire. 
</P>
<P>
Gebel-Williams is slowing, physically and mentally. 
</P>
<P>
The athleticism and concentration required to ride horses and climb elephants 
and be 45 minutes of a 150-minute show now comes more from conscious effort 
than his instincts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Why Risk Having to Think? 
</P>
<P>
And a man who has to think about things has no place inside a steel cage with 
18 suspicious tigers whose supper has been delayed because showman 
Gebel-Williams believes a hungry cat is a peppier performer. 
</P>
<P>
"When I have the idea to jump over a chair, I must do it very easily without 
thinking," he explains. "I don't want to take the risk of jumping and thinking 
maybe I can do it, maybe I can't and I'll fall and land on my nose. 
</P>
<P>
"Why have to think about it? Why take that chance?" 
</P>
<P>
And by hanging on, he asks, why risk a reputation he has bled for? There have 
been more than 500 stitches. The scars on his arms are a scrapbook. He 
stretches one mark with his fingertips: "This was a big zebra in Sweden . . . 
Los Angeles the chew on the elbow . . . here Knoxville . . . Richmond, Va., 
here. 
</P>
<P>
"For sure, I could do it (circus work) another 10 years. But I don't want 
audiences to come in here and say: 'I saw him 10 years ago and, my God, he was 
different then.' " 
</P>
<P>
Gebel-Williams doesn't know why Muhammad Ali clung to the ring. Or why A.J. 
Foyt continues racing. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw an interview with Foyt after Indianapolis and he said his life is 
racing, and I said to myself: 'Sure, maybe he enjoy it to drive behind others. 
But I don't want to stay behind and know there's somebody doing better.' " 
</P>
<P>
Nor does he want to see others performing his unique acts. Poachers have come 
from Europe and Asia to videotape his performances. There are leopard and tiger 
acts in Russia and Japan and "they know everything, every move I do from coming 
here." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to go one day and see somebody else doing my act better than me. 
Later on, I don't care. But right now I have to stay in this position for 
another year and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
The position he is in, of course, is that unique spot reserved for those who 
are the best there is. 
</P>
<P>
He has done talk shows with Merv, Johnny, Dick and Barbara. Three circus Oscars 
are his. He has been deeply profiled by the New York Times, Sports Illustrated 
and Psychology Today, which managed to sterilize the glamour of it all by 
describing his training methods as "heavy doses of positive reinforcement . . . 
and very mild adversive stimulus." 
</P>
<P>
Then there was his American Express commercial. Takes were endless and the 
tiger became impatient. It bit Gebel-Williams on the wrist. "This is my hand, 
dammit," roared the bleeding trainer. "I don't want to leave here without it." 
</P>
<P>
He earns in excess of $100,000 annually and it costs the circus another $2 
million a year to pay, feed and transport Gebel-Williams' 30 employees, 21 
elephants, 22 horses, 22 tigers, 3 camels, 2 llamas, 3 Shetland ponies and 12 
Russian wolfhounds. 
</P>
<P>
The act is really a family of four -- Gunther, wife Sigrid, son Mark, 18, and 
daughter Tina, 26. xThey live aboard a personal railroad car and travel between 
cities in a 40-foot motor coach. Sigrid, a former model, handles books, bills 
and the daily schedule. Tina performs with the wolfhounds. Mark is in training 
to be a trainer. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole family give me support and so I do only my work with the animals all 
the day," Gebel-Williams said. It is an essential continuous relationship that 
might smother others. "I don't make my tax payments and I don't pay my bills 
and I never hang a picture on a wall. Ever. Never." 
</P>
<P>
He also has no time for parties, Sunday interviews, animal activists and fans 
who call him a lion tamer: "I am a trainer, not a tamer . . . and I don't deal 
with lions. The lion is a big showman, all noise. Grrrrrrr, guraaaaaah. Tigers 
are much better. They are more open, more honest." 
</P>
<P>
He is a fan of John Wayne, any astronaut, a 1986 Chevrolet Corvette he trailers 
to each city on the two-year tour, big motorcycles, the occasional Scotch and 
Coca-Cola, cowboy boots, cowboy belt buckles, cowboy shirts, cowboys and 
neurosurgeon Denton Cooley: "I saw him do an operation in Houston and he just 
stood there for eight hours and concentrated. This is unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
He is 5-feet, 8-inches tall, 160 pounds and a blue-eyed gymnast in rhinestone 
tights, a bantamweight Tarzan wearing an open vest over taut chest. It has been 
said that Liberace may be gone, but there still is Gunther Gebel-Williams. The 
blond hair, however, is natural if not quite as bright as it shows. 
</P>
<P>
Circus clowns call him Gunther Goober-Giblet. That acceptance he loves. For he 
is a circus boy who became a circus man and then, to many, a legend to be 
listed alongside Lou Jacobs, Emmett Kelly, Clyde Beatty, the Wallendas and the 
Silly Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
It was ailing, fading, dying Jacobs, the first circus performer to be honored 
by a U.S. postage stamp, who once said: "This guy, Goonter, he is the next 
stamp." 
</P>
<P>
Goonter was born Gunther Gebel in Schweidnitz, Germany, now a part of Poland. 
His father, a soldier in World War II, died on the Russian front. His mother, a 
seamstress, found a postwar job with the Munich-based Circus Williams -- then 
abandoned her son to owners Harry and Carola Williams. 
</P>
<P>
It was a rejection that still confuses Gebel-Williams. But from it, he 
believes, came a fixation for closeness in his own family. It also explains his 
way with animals. 
</P>
<P>
"I was 12 years old and alone and I had nothing," he remembers. "Then I started 
with a little pony that was close to me. Then I helped a horse in practice and 
I felt it trust me. Suddenly, I was something to somebody and friendship was 
coming from the animals. 
</P>
<P>
"I never planned it. I never had the idea I wanted to train tigers. I wanted to 
do something a little bit different and, for me, everything always just come." 
</P>
<P>
As did a father-son friendship with Harry Williams. 
</P>
<P>
But in 1950, Williams was killed in a chariot racing accident during a London 
performance. Carola Williams asked Gebel to supervise the circus. He agreed and 
became Gebel-Williams in honor of a memory -- and to add clout to the 
instructions of a 17-year-old circus manager. 
</P>
<P>
Gebel-Williams was performing with leopards and pumas, and tigers riding 
elephants and horses, when Irvin Feld -- a concert promoter fighting to keep 
the Ringling Bros. circus alive in America -- went after this toast of Europe. 
He got him in 1968 for $2 million. That included the man, his animals and 
5-year employment guarantees for any Circus Williams employees. 
</P>
<P>
In Gebel-Williams, Feld received much, much more than a circus act. 
</P>
<P>
He bought a workaholic who starts at 8 a.m. and rarely finishes before 
midnight. He humps hay bales, hoses down the tigers, rehearses the old animals, 
trains their young, scoops droppings and checks equipment from whips to 
harnesses. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to do this. For the animals. I give them something to eat and they know 
I'm not just there to order them around. I build the relationship from this. I 
do this with my tigers and I do this with my elephants. With horses it makes no 
difference. As long as they have something to eat, who cares who?" 
</P>
<P>
Closeness and constancy, he says, are the only secrets to his work. There is no 
mysticism here, no Tarzan magic. Just be there. 
</P>
<P>
So the tiger cages always are parked close to Gebel-Williams circus bus. He 
feeds Natasha and Rambo, Mousy and Buffy, slabs of beef daily. He talks to them 
by name in passing, tucks them up at night -- and will not be with them if 
there is a veterinary call. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not be there when they have to give a shot," he said. "A lot of tigers 
are scared to death of a needle. It is painful for them. If I'm there, they 
might be scared to death of me and think I made the pain." 
</P>
<P>
Yet he cannot love his tigers. Nor does his physical contact go much beyond a 
scratched neck or a rubbed rump. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no love affair," he says. "Respect is the most important thing. It is 
not: 'I love you, come here my pussy cat.' Every one has claws and teeth and I 
respect them as a tiger, not as a pussy cat. 
</P>
<P>
"And every single one has to keep its own personality. I don't want him to put 
his tail between his legs and always be scared to death. The message is: 
Respect me and I respect you. But I am in charge." 
</P>
<P>
So much in charge, in fact, that he can take 18 tigers from India and Siberia, 
enormous, proud, loners all, and work them easily as a team. The simplicity is 
overpowering. As one clown noted: "What the man does is provide a personal 
relationship. The tigers aren't wild anymore. They're tame. But tame only for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
On this meltdown Phoenix night of his 11,000th American performance, 
Gebel-Williams is working in the cage as always. Perfectly. Quickly. Softly. 
There are two handlers but no loaded revolver in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
He whispers and winks and feigns surprise but his voice remains smooth. The 
tigers know they are doing right. Gebel-Williams tightens his neck, frowns, and 
the voice is harder. The tigers are warned that somebody might be thinking of 
screwing up. 
</P>
<P>
But they are with him, happy to hear their names, content to follow the 
directions of his verbal shorthand spoken in English and German. Jooomp, 
Floppy. Ooop, Rolls. They stand on their hind legs and play leapfrog. They 
waltz, romp, roll over and are Hobbes to his Calvin. 
</P>
<P>
Gebel-Williams salutes the applause and strides from the arena. "That's 
11,001," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Next year it will be abdication. 
</P>
<P>
He plans to move upstairs to circus management, to visit other Ringling Bros. 
shows and pull their animal acts together. He must hire a cat act to replace 
his own. He must also supervise his son's potential as the next Gunther 
Gebel-Williams. 
</P>
<P>
Mark thinks he has it. He says he doesn't doubt that he will be trainer enough 
to manage the big cats. One day. 
</P>
<P>
Gebel-Williams isn't quite so confident. He is not sure that his son has spent 
enough total time with the animals. There have been too many distractions from 
school and the chores of circus apprenticeship. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have to find out," says his father. "I'm yelling at him. I've given 
him a lot of help. But this is a job where you cannot push somebody. 
</P>
<P>
"He is moving towards it. But in the end, performing, you are alone. So, 
outside (the cage) one day I'll say: 'Let's do it.' And then we'll see what 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
And then Gebel-Williams will have to retrain himself; to leisure time, to a 
home that doesn't move and a marriage with children in other parts of the 
country. 
</P>

"I will miss being around the oldest animals, for sure," he said. "Especially 
the elephants. My own Congo. Teichy. Nellie who comes in 1948 when I start in 
1947. This elephant never goes one day in these 40 years when I wasn't there." 
</P>
<P>
As long as the animals are alive, he said, he will keep going back to see them. 
He has vowed never to give the animals to another trainer. Nor will he allow 
the circus to sell them off. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not going to happen to my guys," he said. "If that happen, I'd buy 'em 
all back and put 'em in a big place and we'll be together for all time. For 
sure."

A GOOD COMMUNICATOR AND FUND-RAISER; 
</P>
<P>
CAROL MANCINO: AN ACTIVE LIFE OF VOLUNTEERISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"We thought we'd never leave Cleveland -- that we'd live and die there," Carol 
Mancino of Cheviot Hills says. But in 1980, her husband, Douglas, a tax lawyer 
now with McDermott, Will &amp; Emery, was recruited to Southern California. The 
Mancinos embraced Los Angeles with open arms and are the sort of volunteers who 
make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Mancino is chairwoman of "25 Alive! The Ford Music Center Festival" of 
dance, cuisine, folk tales, crafts and music Saturday and Sunday on the Plaza 
from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. It celebrates the Music Center's 25th 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
"I find Los Angeles exciting and open-minded," she said, sitting in a French 
Regency chair with her 14-year-old West Highland terrier. "In this city, you 
see everything, and that causes you to be more tolerant. I love the exposure to 
different cultures and fashions." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Volunteers Are Givers' 
</P>
<P>
She believes that people make the difference. "And, people who are volunteers 
are givers -- giving time and talents." 
</P>
<P>
The oldest of three girls, she studied ballet for 17 years. Both Mancinos 
graduated from Kent State University in Ohio. She majored in communications and 
eventually joined May Co. in Cleveland. She was divisional vice president for 
May Co. in Southern California for five years, responsible for recruitment, 
placement and development. But, in 1985, she turned volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
At the Music Center, her focus is Club 100. Next year she will be executive 
vice president. For two years she has headed the club's training program on 
communications and personal growth: "If you are a good communicator, then you 
will be a good fund-raiser." She also worked on the first Winterfest concert. 
And for three years she has used her merchandising talents to chair the 
advisory committee of the Music Center Shop on the Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grossed $400,000 
</P>
<P>
The shop grossed $400,000 this year -- partly from sales of several thousand 
"Phantom" T-shirts. "But we had humble beginnings," she says. "We started out 
with a kiosk. We'd pull out a big cart every day, and the wheels would fall 
off. One time the cart blew over in the wind." 
</P>
<P>
At the Music Center, Carol Mancino is also a member of the Blue Ribbon. Doug 
Mancino is a member of the Opera League and the Fraternity of Friends. They're 
also $30,000 Founders donors. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, she will co-chair the Friends of Robinson Gardens benefit next 
year. And she will be seen about town in chic Valentino and Ungaro clothes at 
meetings of the Costume Council, the Fashion Group (women retailing 
professionals) and the Nancy Reagan Center executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
For pleasure -- it's simple -- the arts. "The arts lift my spirits and make me 
feel good." The couple has season tickets for the Ahmanson and the Mark Taper 
theaters and attend the opera, ballet and philharmonic events frequently. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I had a passion for sports, but I don't. I'm more of a spectator 
play-off person." Still, she's taking tennis lessons at Bel-Air Country Club 
and attempting weekend golf. She also will boat and swim at Glenbrook at Lake 
Tahoe for two weeks in August. 
</P>
<P>
Of volunteerism and fund-raising, she says, "A lot of companies seem to have 
lost their stability. Most major corporations still feel obligations to give, 
but in a changing society in Los Angeles, it is sometimes hard to develop 
relationships of giving due to turnover in personnel." 
</P>
<P>
Further, "The challenge today for any organization is that more women are 
working full time. Obviously, they don't have as much time to give. We have to 
adjust with more projects at different hours. The rewards are diversity and new 
friendships."

A BOWL FULL OF BASKETS OF DELIGHTS; 
</P>
<P>
68TH SEASON'S OPENING NIGHT IS FIRST CLASS ALL THE WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There are some things that improve with age: The Hollywood Bowl is one. Tuesday 
night was heaven. For the opening night of the 68th Bowl season, the skies were 
friendly -- only one helicopter. As twilight took its sweet time about becoming 
night, the silhouette of lined up trees on the hill behind the bowl was a 
painting worthy of Sotheby's. 
</P>
<P>
It was all first class. The official Steinway. Schramsberg champagne. Beluga 
caviar. Lobster bisque. Silver goblets. Blue Willow china. The green wicker 
picnic baskets that everyone used to get with Blue Chip Stamps scattered 
throughout the Garden and Terrace box areas. 
</P>
<P>
And there was Nancy Reagan in Box 1131. A memorable Tchaikovsky finale 
conducted by Yuri Temirkanov. Orrin Howard's program notes. Polite parking 
attendants. 
</P>
<P>
Was it going well? "When hasn't it?" Philharmonic executive director Ernest 
Fleischmann quipped, noting that Russian emigre Vladimir Feltsman would be 
starring as pianist in Beethoven's Concerto No. 4 in G, and that Feltsman's 
wife, Anna, had the artist's box. 
</P>
<P>
That was Box 1131, where the lookouts were posted waiting for Nancy Reagan. She 
and son Ron Reagan and his wife, Doria, were the special guests of the 
Feltsmans because of aid in getting them out of the Soviet Union. "For us, they 
are the best people; we love them," Anna said, throwing her arms around Nancy 
Reagan. (Former President Ronald Reagan was in Anaheim, co-announcing the 
All-Star game with Vin Scully.) 
</P>
<P>
In their corner box, where they hosted Dody and Otis Booth, Carol and Mike 
Inman spread black and white plaid place mats, flew black and white balloons 
and set their hook-on trays with herb bouquets and white narcissus. 
</P>
<P>
It took both Judy and Steaven Jones to carry the load of their green hamper 
filled with goodies Judy had concocted from recipes in the Los Angeles Junior 
League Cookbook. Daryn and Bill Horton were waiting for them with "a little 
Schramsberg." 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Colette and Charles Witt had pate from the Biltmore Hotel out for 
Louise and Tom Jones. Maury and Carolyn De Wald and Carla and Rudy Rehm were 
eating Brie before the beef tenderloin and lemon bars. Dee and Bob Wilson set 
up blue agapanthus and red and white roses for Gretchen and George Gibbs before 
presenting Veuve Clicquot. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Panosian wore his yellow suspenders and sat in the $4 top-row seats (the 
better to see the stars), dropping by twice to see his parents, Vera (chairman 
of the Hollywood Bowl Volunteers) and Howard Panosian in their box. 
</P>
<P>
Marian and Stanley Brown had moved that day into the Mirabella condos on 
Wilshire. But the Bowl, with Terry and Diane Mullin as their regular opening 
night guests, is a tradition. The picnic went on. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of tradition, Norma and David McIntyre always serve lobster bisque; 
enjoying were Janice and Bob Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
Where did she want to go for her 19th birthday? Lindsey Kozberg said the Bowl, 
and parents Joanne and Roger Kozberg obliged, bringing along Andrea Van de 
Kamp, whose husband, John, was off campaigning for governor. 
</P>
<P>
Alan (he's Philharmonic board secretary) and Nancy Wayte opened the Bristol 
Farms chervil chicken for Judge William and Julie Masterson. 
</P>
<P>
The Bowl calls for a best effort. Whitley Collins did just that. He invited 
John Roberts, Hayden Eaves and Scott Kerslake to sit in his parents' box. With 
youthful gusto, they chowed down on sandwiches.

It was erroneously reported in James Flanigan's column Wednesday that 
Integrated Resources entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings last month. 
Although the firm halted payments on $864 million of loans and commercial paper 
on June 16, it continues to operate and is restructuring its debt with the 
cooperation of creditors.

Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, who campaigned for President last year touting his 
so-called "Massachusetts Miracle" and his managerial and budget-balancing 
ability, today slashed a half-billion dollars in state spending in a move that 
brought outcries from the poor and the infirm. 
</P>
<P>
The decision, after a yearlong feud with a Democratic-controlled Legislature, 
is expected to eliminate more than 3,000 state jobs and generate mass layoffs 
in local governments dependent on state funds. 
</P>
<P>
"I am today doing the worst thing I have ever had to do in my political life," 
Dukakis said in signing a $12.15-billion budget for the fiscal year that began 
July 1. The total represents $491 million less than the budget sent him by the 
Legislature on June 30.

THREAT OF SUIT HALTS ANAHEIM SALE OF 'PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' TICKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times staff and wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim halted ticket sales today for Ken Hill's "The 
Phantom of the Opera" after a threat of legal action by the producers, who have 
claimed that the sales are unauthorized. 
</P>
<P>
Yale Gutnick, attorney for the Phantom Touring Co., said the theater had done 
"a substantial amount" of business in advance ticket sales. "We don't know how 
many tickets they've sold because we are not getting good information from 
them," Gutnick said from his office in Pittsburgh, Pa., "but our conservative 
guesstimate is in the neighborhood of $100,000 at least." 
</P>
<P>
Celebrity Theatre officials have failed to respond to repeated inquiries from 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The theater has been advertising a December engagement of the show -- a version 
of the "Phantom" that inspired Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical -- for several 
months without authorization, Gutnick said. He was scheduled to speak with 
theater officials today and said he would demand that ticket purchases be 
refunded. 
</P>
<P>
Klaus Kolmar, the New York booking agent for the show's upcoming national tour, 
said Wednesday that the theater had been negotiating for the show but had not 
completed a contract. He said the producers required a deposit in the "low five 
figures" but that the theater "never deposited two cents."

VETO EXPECTED AS ASSEMBLY PASSES BILL REQUIRING MOTORCYCLIST HELMETS

A bill that would require motorcyclists to wear helmets passed the Assembly 
today and was sent to an almost certain veto by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
After final passage of the bill on a 41-20 vote, Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd 
(D-Carson), author of the bill, said he was finished with the issue after nine 
years of working on it and would let another legislator carry it next year. 
</P>
<P>
"The extreme conservatives in the Legislature, the movie people and the Hell's 
Angels seem to be quite a combination," a frustrated Floyd said of the factions 
that mobilized against it over the years. 
</P>
<P>
In his veto message last year, Deukmejian said he believed that mature riders 
should be free to choose for themselves whether to wear a helmet, although he 
favored a law requiring motorcyclists under 21 to wear helmets. He reiterated 
that position at a news conference Wednesday.

BUSH JOINS IN JOIE DE VIVRE IN PARIS;

DOZENS OF WORLD LEADERS HELP MARK FRENCH REVOLUTION

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, buoyed by his landmark visit to Eastern Europe, joined dozens 
of world leaders today for a spectacular Parisian party celebrating the 200th 
anniversary of the French Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Bush helped kick off the festivities by presenting to France the historic key 
to the Bastille fortress, birthplace of a rebellion against the French crown 
two centuries ago. The key, in U.S. hands since 1790, is on temporary loan. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was greeted by French President Francois Mitterrand at the inaugural 
bicentennial event at the Place du Trocadero commemorating the Declaration of 
the Rights of Man. That statement, issued in August, 1789, set forth the French 
Revolution's aims of liberty, fraternity and equality for all people. 
</P>
<P>
The world leaders sat on a blue-and-white grandstand listening to a young man 
and woman who took turns reading the 17 articles of the declaration. A 
children's choir dressed in white sang a "song of joy," played games and threw 
peace laurels, flowers and children's toys on the esplanade. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the ceremony, the leaders burst into applause as a flock of doves 
flew over the palace. Then, chatting amiably, they left for a lunch given by 
Mitterrand, who sat next to Bush during the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Security was tight with an estimated 30,000 police, including rooftop marksmen, 
guarding the summit events. Police also towed away about 1,000 vehicles as part 
of their ban on traffic in the main thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, Mitterrand greeted each leader arriving by limousine at the ceremony 
site near the Eiffel Tower. The crowd in the street cheered when Philippines 
President Corazon Aquino appeared. Other guests included Prime Minister Rajiv 
Gandhi of India, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, President Mobutu Sese 
Seko of Zaire and other African leaders, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de 
Cuellar, Brazilian President Jose Sarney, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari and Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, after a private 40-minute meeting with Mitterrand, Bush took 
part in ceremonies marking the return -- actually a brief loan -- of the key to 
the Bastille, the site where the French Revolution began when the fortress was 
stormed in an uprising against the crown on July 14, 1789. 
</P>
<P>
Bush presented the large iron Bastille key to Mitterrand for display through 
July 22 at the new Bastille Opera house, adjacent to the site of the famous 
fortress. 
</P>
<P>
The key was given to George Washington nearly 200 years ago by the Marquis de 
Lafayette. Since 1797, the key has never left Washington's estate in northern 
Virginia. Since 1858, the historic artifact has been in the possession of the 
Mount Vernon Ladies' Assn., the private, nonprofit organization that owns and 
operates Washington's home.

'UNCONSCIOUS' FOR 4 HOURS, PILOT SURVIVES CRASH IN SEA; 
</P>
<P>
HE SWIMS TO RESCUERS IN BAHAMAS

<P>
A small plane, with its stricken pilot slumped over the controls apparently 
unconscious, ran out of fuel and crashed into the ocean today after flying for 
four hours and hundreds of miles on autopilot. Astonished rescuers said the man 
swam toward them and was pulled alive from the water. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, identified as a Washington, D.C., lawyer, was taken by helicopter to 
Nassau, the Bahamas, and was to be flown by jet to Florida, the Coast Guard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The words you keep hearing are: 'You're kidding,' " said Petty Officer 
Veronica Cady, a Coast Guard spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Military pilots and rescuers trained to parachute into the ocean to save 
ditched pilots could only watch helplessly as their aircraft tracked the 
single-engine plane for nearly four hours while it slowly ran out of gas. The 
plane crashed in the Atlantic near the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
"With all that time he didn't answer us, no communication whatsoever, seen 
slumped behind the wheel, we assumed he was at the least unconscious," Cady 
said. "For him to survive a crash like that, it just sent us all into shock. We 
didn't expect this story to have a happy ending." 
</P>
<P>
Rescuers did not know how he got out of the plane, she said. There was no 
immediate word on the man's condition. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration declined to identify the pilot, but staff 
members at the Washington law firm of Thomas Root, 36, a communications lawyer, 
confirmed that he was the man. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing more was heard from him after he reported to air traffic controllers in 
Virginia at 8:30 a.m. that he was having chest pains and difficulty breathing. 
He had taken off from Washington's National Airport at about 6:30 a.m. bound 
for Rocky Mount, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apparently Unconscious 
</P>
<P>
The man was glimpsed, apparently unconscious, at one point as the plane headed 
southward roughly parallel to the East Coast. There was no one else visible in 
the plane, and radio messages to the plane went unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard said the plane ran out of gas and crashed into the ocean in the 
central Bahamas, about 15 miles east of the island of Eleuthera. The site is 
about 250 miles southeast of Miami and 800 miles from the pilot's original 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
Reports from the planes tailing the Cessna were that "it spiraled into the 
water, so it didn't make the best of all possible landings," Chief Petty 
Officer Lou Parris said. 
</P>
<P>
FAA spokesman Jack Barker in Atlanta said that as the plane headed southward, 
it had gotten as near as 100 miles from the East Coast shore because of the 
curvature of the coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Hans Hess, manager of the Rocky Mount-Wilson, N.C., airport, said the plane had 
been due to arrive there at 7:49 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
After its distress call, the plane was intercepted by two Marine Corps F-A-18 
Hornets when it entered Norfolk Naval Station airspace at 8:45 a.m., said Lt. 
Cmdr. Mike John, a Navy spokesman. The pilots of the intercepting planes tried 
unsuccessfully to establish voice contact with the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
Root's staff gathered around a portable radio to hear news that he had been 
fished out of the water alive, but Signe Schilperoort, a paralegal in the 
office, said they had received no word on his condition from authorities.

Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich was in stable condition today at 
St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank where he is being treated for a slight 
case of pneumonia, a spokesman said. 
</P>

Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson, the longest-serving incumbent governor in the 
nation, announced today that he will not seek a fifth term in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Near tears and with his voice wavering at times, Thompson told reporters that 
his decision was based on family and career reasons. He added that he would 
"enjoy the challenge of the private sector" but also said he might seek another 
government office. 
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old Thompson, a moderate Republican who has served 12 years, was 
mentioned as a possible presidential candidate early in his career and as a 
vice presidential candidate last year.

Remember the raincoat that President Bush so generously took off and gave to an 
elderly woman in a rainstorm in Budapest, Hungary? Well, it wasn't his. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Bush said today that the raincoat belonged to a Secret Service agent 
who was accompanying the President to an arrival ceremony in a downtown square 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
After making an abbreviated speech, Bush spotted the woman in the crowd, 
drenched to the bone after a heavy downpour. He took off the raincoat and gave 
it to her -- a seemingly selfless gesture that attracted a lot of publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Promising to replace the agent's coat, Barbara Bush said she and the President 
know the exact brand they have to get.

FIRING SQUAD EXECUTES CUBAN HERO;

Cuban war hero Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez and three other former army officers were 
executed by firing squad today for shipping tons of drugs into the United 
States, the official Cuban news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The executions ended a court-martial and appeal process that revealed a ring in 
the army and Interior Ministry engaged in drug trafficking, black marketeering, 
smuggling and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The Prensa Latina news agency said the four were executed at dawn in Cuba. In 
addition to Ochoa, a former army general, they included former Col. Antonio de 
la Guardia Font; former Maj. Armado Padron, and former Capt. Jorge Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stripped of Ranks 
</P>
<P>
They were sentenced to death last week, stripped of their military ranks and 
thrown out of the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
Ochoa, 57, fought in the guerrilla war that brought Fidel Castro to power and 
was made a Hero of the Revolution, Cuba's highest honor, for heading Cuba's 
50,000-man expedition in Angola and an earlier one to Ethiopia. Ochoa also 
headed a mission to Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government. 
</P>
<P>
The defendants appealed their sentences to the Council of State. The council's 
29 members voted unanimously Sunday to uphold the death sentences. 
</P>
<P>
Castro, giving a five-hour summation to the panel, said the four must face a 
firing squad to restore faith in the Cuban revolution, ensure discipline in the 
armed forces and set an example for others. 
</P>
<P>
Prensa Latina quoted Castro as saying Wednesday that the accused "must have 
felt they were the most untouchable people in the world" since they were led by 
"a hero of the republic, a division general, a man with the prestige that Ochoa 
had." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to drug trafficking, they were convicted of treason and other 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
The court-martial also handed out prison sentences ranging from 10 years to 30 
years to 10 other defendants in the case. They were stripped of rank and 
decorations and were dishonorably discharged. 
</P>
<P>
The scandal shook Castro's government, embarrassing him and the Communist 
Party. He had for years been denying U.S. accusations that his nation was being 
used for drug shipments, saying the reports were a plot to embarrass the 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
But he had to admit the accusations are true. In addition to the officers put 
on trial, the transportation and interior ministers have been sacked, and there 
have been unconfirmed reports that other officials were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Castro said the drug scandal did immense internal damage, eroded Cuba's 
international image and crippled the tourism industry it has been trying to 
foster.

<P>
A bomb exploded today outside a discotheque patronized by American military 
personnel, wounding seven U.S. Army soldiers, three of them seriously, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred shortly after midnight at La Ceiba, more than 200 miles 
north of Tegucigalpa, U.S. Embassy spokesman Charles V. Barclay said in a 
telephone interview. There was no claim of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth attack on U.S. soldiers in Honduras since Feb. 1. Three 
soldiers were injured in the previous incidents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Victims Were MPs 
</P>
<P>
Today's victims were Army military police, who were in La Ceiba to act as 
escorts for about 150 American soldiers taking part in a joint road-building 
exercise with Honduran troops, Barclay said. He said the entire group was due 
to leave La Ceiba today. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said the 
explosive was thrown as the Americans left a disco. Barclay could not confirm 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know if the explosive device was hurled from a passing automobile or 
had been detonated in place," Barclay said. 
</P>
<P>
The injured soldiers were part of a group of nine who had been given a night's 
leave and were in civilian clothes. Two uninjured soldiers fled and were 
arrested by Honduran troops because they had no identification, a Honduran 
military commander said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Serious Condition 
</P>
<P>
Barclay said three of the wounded soldiers were in serious condition, while the 
four others suffered lesser injuries. He said all were assigned to the Enrique 
Soto Cano Air Base, 50 miles northeast of Tegucigalpa, a major center for U.S. 
troops in Honduras. 
</P>
<P>
The wounded soldiers were rushed to a private hospital in La Ceiba, Barclay 
said. Their names were not released. 
</P>
<P>
Col. Eric Sanchez said the uninjured Americans were being held until they could 
be officially identified by U.S. officials. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, the Honduran military commander at La Ceiba, said the attack occurred 
at 12:30 a.m. and involved a "homemade explosive device." 
</P>
<P>
Barclay said the troops were part of a convoy that had been building roads in a 
province 120 miles east of La Ceiba. The convoy had stopped for the night 
during its trip back to Soto Cano. 
</P>
<P>
About 15,000 American troops and Honduran soldiers were taking part in an 
exercise called Strong Roads that began in December and ended Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
At least 20 American soldiers have been wounded in attacks in Honduras since 
1982, when the United States started increasing its military presence in this 
country and holding joint exercises with Honduran troops. 
</P>
<P>
Today's attack came three months after unidentified assailants used gunfire and 
an explosive to attack a jeep convoy carrying 11 U.S. and six Honduran soldiers 
outside Olanchita, near La Ceiba. One jeep was disabled in the April 11 attack, 
but no injuries were reported.

UNILEVER WILL BUY FABERGE, ELIZABETH ARDEN FOR $1.55 BILLION

<P>
Unilever, the British-Dutch consumer products giant, has agreed to buy the 
Faberge and Elizabeth Arden lines of toiletries, cosmetics and fragrances for 
$1.55 billion, Unilever and Faberge announced today. 
</P>
<P>
The new deal between Faberge's owner, Riklis Family Corp., and Unilever United 
States Inc., the holding company for the group's American operations, is 
expected to be completed within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
Unilever and Riklis had reached an agreement in principle on the takeover in 
February and intended to negotiate details of a final contract within three 
months, but the talks broke down. 
</P>
<P>
In late April, Unilever said it abandoned its plan of buying Faberge Inc. and 
its independent subsidiary, Elizabeth Arden, because Meshulam Riklis' Riklis 
group sought to make significant changes in the tentative deal that would have 
meant Unilever had to pay more. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint news release today, the companies said all differences have been 
resolved. A definitive contract has been signed, with completion of the 
transaction subject to a number of technical conditions that the companies did 
not specify. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Atkins, a spokesman for Unilever, said the conditions are minor matters 
that will not jeopardize the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, Unilever is to buy all of Faberge except for the McGregor 
Apparel Group, which is made up of clothing lines such as Botany 500, 
Wonderknit and Bill the Kid. 
</P>
<P>
Combined sales of Faberge and Elizabeth Arden amounted to more than $800 
million in the year ended January, 1989, and profit was $93 million.

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney defended the embattled B-2 Stealth bomber today 
and chided House members for protesting its price tag now after a decade of 
support for the radar-evading plane. 
</P>
<P>
"I recognize the sticker shock," Cheney told the House Armed Services 
Committee, referring to the $70-billion program for 132 bombers at $530 million 
each. 
</P>
<P>
"If you look at it in historical perspective, it's not that unreasonable," he 
added, saying the program will consume a smaller percentage of the defense 
budget than either the B-52 or the B-1B bombers. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney, who took over at the Pentagon in April after serving in the House for a 
decade, noted that the committee and the Congress for a decade has been 
approving money for the B-2, a program that has now consumed $23 billion, with 
one plane on the runway for testing, five more at various stages of production 
and five more approved and paid for. 
</P>
<P>
"This committee . . .is probably more responsible for the B-2 program in its 
current state than I am," Cheney said. "We can afford it. Let's go for it." 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, if Congress does not want the bomber, it should kill the program 
outright. "You shouldn't nickel and dime it to death. You have to make that 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney was confronted by senior committee members -- Chairman Les Aspin 
(D-Wis.) and ranking Republican Bill Dickinson of Alabama -- over the $7 
billion to $8 billion a year the program seeks in the early 1990s, and the near 
political impossibility of spending that much on one weapon system in a single 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Technology problems, Dickinson said, are not the stumbling block. 
</P>
<P>
"The big problem with B-2 is the total cost," he said, noting that program 
details were secret for so long that when cost details were declassified in 
recent months "most members were aghast. . . . I'm telling you, I do not 
believe Congress is going to fund that at $6, $7, $8 billion a year for three 
or four years." 
</P>
<P>
"If Congress doesn't fund it, we won't buy it," said Cheney, who strenuously 
argued the plane's virtues in being able to slip past Soviet air defense 
radars, on which Moscow has invested $320 billion, to reach its targets. 
</P>
<P>
In response to Cheney's assertion that members had approved of the program over 
the years, Aspin said, "The record's replete with examples of 'this isn't going 
to fly' financially." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney argued that the price tag "is not out of line, given what we've paid for 
other programs."

Violence flared anew on mining picket lines today with the president of a 
Kentucky coal company hospitalized after being hit in the face with a rock. In 
West Virginia, miners were arrested by the vanload for blocking a bridge. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Snavely, president of A. T. Massey subsidiary Sidney Coal Co. in 
Kentucky's Pike County, was hospitalized this morning after he was hit in the 
face with a rock, a company spokeswoman said. In Prenter, W.Va., about 400 
United Mine Workers members and supporters blocked a road leading to non-union 
Elk Run Coal Co. today, saying they would not move until arrested. More than 30 
miners had been arrested before noon, said state police spokesman Ric Robinson. 
"We're arresting them literally by the vanload," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The incidents came one day after the UMW union extended a contractually allowed 
three-day work stoppage for two more days after a spate of wildcat strikes in 
eight states.

</P>
<P>
After shutting out the Americans in the first two periods, West Germany led 4-1 
entering the final quarter. The Americans stormed back to tie the game but 
still fell short despite outscoring the West Germans 5-3 in the last quarter.

A former major league umpire has filed a suit against the New York Daily News 
and one of its writers, seeking more than $5 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
KRIV-TV in Houston obtained a copy of the suit, which said the Daily News and 
writer Dave Kaplan irresponsibly and maliciously published an article falsely 
reporting that former umpire Satch Davidson, who retired in 1984, had been 
involved in gambling and helped fix baseball games. 
</P>
<P>
Davidson, 54, denies the report and seeks damages of $5 million or more from 
New York News Inc., depending on the net worth of the organization. The suit 
also asks for $50,000 or more from Kaplan, depending on his net worth. 
</P>
<P>
"What I've said and what the lawsuit says speaks for itself," Davidson, an 
umpire for 19 years, said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
F. Gilman Spencer, editor of the Daily News, said today that the suit has been 
turned over to the paper's lawyers.

<P>
A long ride in the southern French countryside by Tour de France cyclists 
produced little change as Laurent Fignon of France and Greg LeMond of the 
United States remained 1-2 today in the standings after the 12th stage. 
</P>
<P>
The tedium of group riding was broken only by a small demonstration in a town 
about 12 miles from the finish. About a dozen people protesting the location of 
garbage dumps in the area put some trees and rocks on a narrow passage on the 
cyclists' route. 
</P>
<P>
Roadside fans helped officials clear away the barricades, but a television 
reporter was punched by one of the demonstrators, and the main pack of riders 
had to stop briefly. 
</P>
<P>
There were no serious delays, however, and the results of today's 150-mile race 
from Toulouse to Montpellier were unaltered by the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Italians Valerio Tebaldi and Giancarlo Perini and Frenchman Dominique Arnaud 
escaped early and gradually built up a 20-minute advantage over the rest of the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
Tebaldi eventually won in a sprint over Perini in 5 hours, 40 minutes, 54 
seconds with Arnaud third, more than two minutes back. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the field -- including Fignon in 25th position and LeMond in 46th 
-- trailed by more than 21 minutes, and two-time Tour winner Fignon maintained 
his 7-second advantage over LeMond, the 1986 champion. 
</P>
<P>
The overall standings were left unchanged among the leaders as the group seemed 
to be conserving its strength for the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
The men's race is a 2,020-mile counterclockwise journey around France, ending 
in Paris on July 23. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Olympic champion Monique Knol of the Netherlands took the second 
stage of the women's Tour de France today to retain the lead. She holds a 
17-second lead in the overall standings over two-time champion Jeannie Longo of 
France. 
</P>
<P>
American Susan Elias is now third, 35 seconds back. 
</P>
<P>
The women's Tour this year is shorter than usual but has more mountain climbs. 
It is 482 miles long and has 11 stages, ending just before the men's Tour in 
Paris.
