SENATE BACKS CAP ON IMMIGRATION; 
</P>
<P>
SETS LIMIT OF 630,000; ILLEGAL ALIENS WOULD NOT BE COUNTED IN 1990 CENSUS

<P>
The Senate on Thursday night approved a bill that would overhaul the nation's 
laws on legal immigration, establishing an annual cap of 630,000 immigrants in 
each of the next three years and opening the doors to more residents of Western 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Passed on an 81-17 vote, the measure deals primarily with those who seek visas 
to enter this country. And, with the exception of a few amendments, it does not 
affect the landmark 1986 law that granted amnesty to illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
"We have finally passed a long-needed reform of our country's immigration laws 
for legal immigrants," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), a key sponsor of 
the bill. "In effect, we will no longer be short-changing people from some 
countries who have not been able to come to this country in such great 
numbers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aliens and 1990 Census 
</P>
<P>
The measure includes a provision that directs the secretary of commerce not to 
count illegal aliens as part of the 1990 census. The census count determines 
each state's share of seats in the House of Representatives and is often used 
to apportion government grants. The provision is a setback for California and 
other border states that have large numbers of illegal alien residents. 
</P>
<P>
The House is expected to take up its own version of the legislation later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate, reacting to the repression of pro-democracy demonstrators in China, 
also increased the annual immigration quota for Hong Kong to 10,000 from 5,000 
and agreed to allow Chinese students studying in the United States to remain 
for four years. The bill permits them to qualify for legal residency without 
returning to China unless the President decides it is safe for them to return. 
</P>
<P>
Under the immigration bill, there would be a national ceiling of 630,000 
persons annually who could immigrate to the United States. The total would 
include 150,000 visas allocated to persons with special skills or education in 
high demand and 480,000 visas for the immediate and extended family members of 
U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
These guidelines would be in effect for three years, at the end of which 
Congress and the President could review immigration patterns and determine 
whether changes should be made in the number of visas granted for different 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy and other sponsors said that the Senate legislation would redress an 
imbalance in the current immigration system, under which about 85% of all U.S. 
visas are granted each year to persons from Latin American or Asian nations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Open Doors 
</P>
<P>
Most of these immigrants come to America to be reunited with family members who 
are already here. However, the new legislation would expand the number of visas 
reserved for skilled immigrants who do not typically have family members 
residing in the United States. That provision is expected to crack open the 
doors for Western Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
Amid the flurry of amendments considered Thursday, the one prompting the most 
passionate debate involved barring illegal aliens from being counted in the 
census. That amendment, by Sen. Richard C. Shelby (D-Ala.), was approved by a 
voice vote. Earlier, the senators had voted, 58 to 41, against an attempt to 
kill the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe the founding fathers ever intended that aliens should be 
counted in the census and determine the political makeup of this country," said 
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), who joined with senators from other states that do 
not have large numbers of illegal aliens to approve Shelby's controversial 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
If the measure becomes law, it could diminish sharply the number of 
congressional seats that California expected to receive as a result of the 
reapportionment that will be based on the 1990 census. The state, with a 
population estimated in 1987 at 27.7 million, is believed to have more than 
half of the nation's 3 million to 8 million illegal aliens. In the next 
reapportionment, the state was expected to add five or more seats to its 
45-member congressional delegation. 
</P>
<P>
Although it is unclear how the House will react to the controversial census 
provision, Kennedy predicted that it would face "very strong opposition" in the 
other chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Senators from states with large numbers of illegal aliens said that it is 
unconstitutional to ignore such individuals in the census, but others said that 
the majority of Americans would strongly support such an amendment. 
</P>
<P>
Helms charged that, if the practice of counting such persons in the census 
continues, California and other states "will gain seats at North Carolina's 
expense and other state's expense, because people are breaking the law and 
entering this country illegally." 
</P>
<P>
However, Kennedy and other critics said that the Constitution requires census 
takers to count "all persons" living in a state, not merely citizens. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Constitution could not be more clear," Kennedy said. "Every census in 
this country since 1790 has counted all persons in a state . . . we have 
counted people who were here legally and illegally. There's no reason to stop 
now." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Called Impractical 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) charged that Shelby's amendment is impractical, 
because it would be difficult for census takers going door to door to determine 
if people are U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
In action it took as it worked on the bill, the Senate rejected a move to 
require English language proficiency for new visa applicants and defeated a bid 
to slash the number of visas reserved for the extended family members of U.S. 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
Senators also voted for a motion by Sen. J. James Exon (D-Neb.) barring direct 
federal benefits to illegal aliens. Although current law denies benefits such 
as welfare and food stamps to such persons, Exon said his amendment would close 
some loopholes, particularly those enabling some illegal aliens to receive 
Social Security payments. 
</P>
<P>
Several senators failed in a bid to require many of the immigrants in the 
"skilled" categories to demonstrate English proficiency. Simon, who led the 
fight against such provisions, said that it is wrong to impose language 
requirements because many immigrants came to this country in the past without 
speaking English and went on to lead successful lives. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Amnesty Amendments 
</P>
<P>
While the overall bill deals primarily with the "legal" immigration system, 
Exon and other senators attached amendments affecting key elements of the 1986 
bill granting amnesty to illegal aliens. In particular, the Senate voted 
Wednesday to provide a stay of deportation for the immediate family members of 
persons who qualified for amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
The provision would affect 1.5 million persons who did not qualify for amnesty 
protection and are currently living in fear of deportation, according to Sen. 
John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), who wrote the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the House voted to make it easier for some Soviet and 
Indochinese to get into the United States as refugees. The bill passed on a 
358-44 vote and was sent to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is intended to assist Soviet Jews, Soviet evangelical Christians and 
certain Indochinese aliens. The measure would help their admission by presuming 
that those groups are persecuted in their own countries, rather than placing 
the burden of proof of persecution on the individuals.

FIRM TO OFFER AIDS DRUG FREE IN CRITICAL CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In a decision that AIDS activists hope will lead to significantly widened 
access to experimental AIDS drugs, Bristol-Myers Co. pledged Thursday to 
provide "compassionate use" of its drug DDI, or dideoxyinosine, to any AIDS 
patient who cannot participate in formal trials but "for whom the drug is 
critical." 
</P>
<P>
The new program will begin in September and will run parallel to Phase 2 trials 
designed to test the antiviral drug's effectiveness as an AIDS therapy. The 
company said the plan conforms to Food and Drug Administration regulations and 
appears to fit with the innovative dual-track drug-testing program outlined 
last month by Dr. Anthony Fauci, National Institutes of Health AIDS research 
chief. 
</P>
<P>
Bristol made its announcement here after weeks of behind-the-scenes 
negotiations with government officials and members of the AIDS advocacy group 
ACT UP -- and on the same day as three dozen Canadian AIDS activists staged a 
demonstration at the drug giant's Toronto office. Six members of the group AIDS 
Action Now were arrested for trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
"This could be the start of a historic shift . . . in which the AIDS community 
and the pharmaceutical companies sit down and cooperate with one another," said 
Mark Harrington, who negotiated with Bristol on behalf of ACT UP. 
</P>
<P>
Harrington added, however, that "it all depends on how they define the word 
critical." In the past, he noted, some companies have restricted 
compassionate-use distribution to patients who are within days or weeks of 
death rather than making drugs available in earlier stages of an illness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cousin of AZT 
</P>
<P>
DDI, which is taken orally, is a chemical cousin of Burroughs-Wellcome's drug 
AZT, the only antiviral drug currently approved by the FDA for use against the 
human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS. Bristol bought worldwide 
marketing rights to DDI from the drug's developer, the National Cancer 
Institute, in January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In Phase 1 toxicity trials of the drug at the National Cancer Institute and 
other medical centers, DDI suppressed production of the virus and led to what 
scientists said were statistically significant increases in T-4 helper cells, 
the white blood cells that are key sentinels of the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
More important, DDI appeared to be well-tolerated by AIDS patients. AZT, on the 
other hand, is so toxic that some have estimated that up to 50% of AIDS 
patients have been forced to reduce or eliminate their use of the drug. 
</P>
<P>
"DDI is the only drug we have now for people who are intolerant of AZT, or for 
those who develop strains of the virus that are resistant to AZT," said Dr. 
Mathilde Krim, founding chair of the American Foundation for AIDS Research. 
"The company is to be praised for its moral leadership in the face of this 
public health emergency." 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, we can really talk about giving people an antiviral drug 
other than AZT," said Dr. Ellen Cooper, director of the FDA's division of 
antiviral drugs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Free to Patients 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, details of which remain to be worked out, Bristol is expected 
to provide the drug free. In return, said Thomas D. McCann, vice president for 
corporate communications, "we would hope to collect data" to supplement data 
gathered in the more rigorous formal trials for eventual submission to the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
Bristol said it will begin formal trials and compassionate-use programs in both 
the United States and Canada by September, 1989, after regulatory officials 
review and accept the company's Phase 1 safety data. 
</P>
<P>
By collecting data from the compassionate-use patients, Bristol hopes to 
overcome one of the biggest problems drug companies have encountered in the 
past under such programs. Drug industry observers believe that FDA licensing of 
Syntex Corp.'s drug ganciclovir was delayed by several years because the 
company gave so much of it away on compassionate use to treat AIDS-related 
cytomegalovirus retinitis, an infection that can cause blindness. 
</P>
<P>
Although the compassionate-use program will probably add millions of dollars to 
the company's drug development expenses, "if DDI proves itself to be superior 
to AZT, it will be a very nice product for Bristol," said Drexel Burnham 
Lambert drug analyst David Lippman. Annual revenues, he estimated, would be "in 
the hundreds of millions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
FDA licensing of the drug could also provide a measure of financial relief to 
employers, insurance companies and government programs that currently pay up to 
$8,000 a year per patient taking AZT. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Control on Price 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the National Cancer Institute's contract with Bristol, the 
government can force Bristol to license the drug to another company if Bristol 
does not set a reasonable price for the drug. A Bristol spokesman said it is 
premature to discuss the drug's pricing. 
</P>
<P>
The struggle over access to DDI represents a new phase in the efforts of AIDS 
patient-advocates to obtain promising drugs. 
</P>
<P>
"Hallelujah," added ACT UP's founder, playwright Larry Kramer. "I pray that 
Bristol's magnificent example will be duplicated by the manufacturers of 
numerous other life-saving drugs." 
</P>
<P>
The company's announcement capped a week in which some government regulators 
feared that Bristol seemed paralyzed by steadily mounting pressure from the 
activists and conflicting signals from the FDA and the NIH involving 
terminology and general ground rules of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, Bristol chose to call the plan a "compassionate-use" program -- 
language favored by the FDA -- rather than using the "parallel track" 
terminology embraced by the NIH. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the label, said Bristol spokesman Jerry Parrott, "we are committed to 
the idea conceptually" and "we are working with the government right now" to 
develop the details of the program." 
</P>
<P>
"Any patient who does not meet the criteria for Phase 2 clinical trials, but 
for whom DDI is critical, would receive the drug under this plan," the company 
said. Spokesmen for Bristol said they could not estimate how many patients 
would receive the drug under the trials and compassionate-use programs, 
although it would certainly be in the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Effective Dosage 
</P>
<P>
The drug has been used by 90 patients during Phase 1 trials. In addition, an 
undetermined number of people have purchased an alleged chemical equivalent 
through the flourishing AIDS treatment underground. Based on Phase 1 data, a 
safe and effective dose appears to be two grams per day, according to sources 
within the Public Health Service. 
</P>
<P>
Bristol spokesman Parrott insisted that the company was not swayed by the 
Toronto demonstration or the threat of similar actions at its Park Avenue 
headquarters in New York, where ACT UP has in the past marshaled more than 
3,000 people for major demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Harrington said, "our Canadian friends gave Bristol a foreshadowing of 
what was in store for them" if the company refused to release DDI. Activists 
also raised the possibility of a boycott of Bristol's consumer products, which 
include Bufferin, Ban and Windex. 
</P>
<P>
Other lobbyists for the program included government officials such as Fauci and 
Dr. Neil Schram, a Harbor City physician and head of the American Assn. of 
Physicians for Human Rights committee on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
"The rules have just been rewritten," Schram said Thursday. "It is a remarkable 
thing."

SWEET HOME, Ore. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Steve Rood was on a last tour through the old Sweet Home Sawmill, hopping down 
creaking catwalks to look at a cannibalized edging saw. 
</P>
<P>
"It is no fun seeing it this way," he said, and sighed. 
</P>
<P>
Rood will not have to look for long at the idled mill in the heart of town. 
Workmen already were busy dismantling the massive old building plank by plank, 
setting aside the pieces to meet an inglorious end as free firewood. 
</P>
<P>
As the mill shrinks in size, it grows as a symbol of the timber controversy in 
the Pacific Northwest. The Willamette Industries plant is the third mill to 
close in the last year in this mill town of 6,890 people, and one of at least a 
score of sawmills idled throughout Oregon in that time. 
</P>
<P>
Willamette Industries and others cite several reasons for closing their mills, 
but the one that most often boils people's blood is the log supply shortage 
attributed to lawsuits over the future of the northern spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
With the failure last month of a summit between preservationists and timber 
companies, and the start next month of hearings on whether to formally protect 
the owl, many people fear environmental concerns will close other mills soon. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe one of Sweet Home's five remaining mills will be among those closed. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe all of them. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a pervading uncertainty and questioning," said Erik V. Kvarsten, the 
Sweet Home city manager. "People here are uncertain about their very 
livelihood. This area is good for one thing, logging, and people here see that 
being taken away from them." 
</P>
<P>
Even for people used to the boom-and-bust logging industry, the prospect of 
massively expanding wildlife preserves -- one-fourth of this year's U.S. Forest 
Service timber sales and a third of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management's sales 
have been blocked by court order -- is frightening. 
</P>
<P>
"The 1982 recession was caused by cyclical issues like interest rates, and 
people realized they would eventually right themselves," Kvarsten said. "But 
with these environmental issues, people are not sure it will ever change. They 
don't see it ever ending or getting better." 
</P>
<P>
In Oregon, with its uniquely generous revenue-sharing plan with the federal 
government, losing timberland means losing much more than a few thousand jobs. 
It also means losing timber receipts set aside for schools and roads -- perhaps 
$72 million lost to the state. 
</P>
<P>
"Those of us who live here, we are caught between the preservationists and the 
industry," said John Kunzman, who owns two Sweet Home timber-supply shops and 
organizes grass-roots support for loggers throughout the Northwest. "We're the 
ones being squeezed in the middle; we're the ones being crushed." 
</P>
<P>
Sweet Home will not sour without a fight. As in a growing number of logging 
communities, from Happy Camp, Calif., to Forks, Wash., yellow ribbons fly from 
homes, cars and businesses to show support for loggers. And lately tiny yellow 
dots have appeared on the cash that loggers spend, illustrating the importance 
of their paychecks to the region's economy. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, some folks in Sweet Home went so far as to issue open invitations to 
city dwellers from Portland, Los Angeles and even New York City to come for a 
brief visit -- stay with a local family if necessary -- and see for themselves 
what logging is all about. 
</P>
<P>
"We want people to come here and see what we are doing," said Dan Conrad, a 
Willamette Industries employee. "We want them to see that we aren't tearing up 
the land, and we aren't about to cut down the last tree in Oregon." 
</P>
<P>
Conrad and Kunzman -- leaders of the Sweet Home chapter of Communities for a 
Great Oregon, a grass-roots lobbying group -- say they have heard from 
relatives and friends who mistakenly believe that Oregon is about to lose its 
last tree. 
</P>
<P>
Reality is far more complex. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Leading Timber State 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Oregon is still by far the country's most productive timber state, 
followed by California and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Like those states, Oregon is covered by many millions of trees that contain 
many billions of board-feet of wood. The temperate, well-watered, mineral-rich 
Coast Range and Cascade Range mountains remain the best places on the planet to 
grow softwood trees, especially straight and strong Douglas fir. 
</P>
<P>
But there are problems. Not all those trees are readily available. Many are 
preserved in parks and wilderness areas. Many more, on intensively cut private 
lands, are too young to harvest until well into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
What is left, to a great extent, are the federal forests managed by the Forest 
Service and Bureau of Land Management. But these public lands have many uses -- 
only one of which is to supply timber. Providing recreation is another, as is 
protecting watershed that supplies most of the region's surface water. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodating wildlife is another land use, with the northern spotted owl 
causing the most concern at the moment. To help maintain a degree of biological 
diversity that scientists say is needed to preserve the environment, a federal 
law forbids the government to drive any species into extinction. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists have charged that cutting down virgin, or "old growth," 
timber threatens the northern spotted owl with extinction. Scientists agree 
that this owl subspecies requires several unusual characteristics of old-growth 
forests, such as standing dead trees to give it a hunting perch, living trees 
of various sizes to let it hide from predators and dead logs to house its prey. 
</P>
<P>
Such characteristics normally are not found in managed tree plantations that 
usually replace old growth once it is cut. Plantations tend to have even-sized 
trees, few if any dead trees or downed logs, and clean forest floors. 
</P>
<P>
However, research is being conducted to determine if the most critical 
old-growth characteristics can be successfully mimicked on tree plantations, as 
well as to see if the owl is naturally adapting to "second growth" on tree 
farms. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, research is under way to determine exactly how many northern spotted 
owls are out there. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recently estimated that 
there are perhaps 3,000 to 4,500 -- many more than the decade-old estimate of a 
few hundred birds, but possibly far fewer than what may be seen by large bands 
of scientists now combing the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty over this shy, mottled-brown, 16-inch-high raptor fuels the 
bitter debate over how far people should go to protect it. 
</P>
<P>
Loggers, from paneled Portland board rooms to noisy Sweet Home mill floors, 
insist that current court injunctions obtained by preservationists go much too 
far, considering the large gaps in research about the bird. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists, including the national Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund and 
local Oregon Natural Resources Defense Council, counter that the owl acts as a 
proverbial "canary in a coal mine" and its difficulties indicate fundamental 
problems with the region's entire forest ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
But if the condition and fate of the northern spotted owl is uncertain, so too 
is the condition and fate of logging towns such as Sweet Home. Such towns were 
not part of the "Oregon Comeback" that pulled Portland up from the 1982 
recession by diversifying its economy into Pacific Rim trade and electronics. 
</P>
<P>
Sweet Home, like other rural Pacific Northwest mill towns, lives on lumber. The 
Chamber of Commerce said the nine largest private firms here employ 1,202; 
1,000 of those jobs -- 83% -- are in forest products, from lumber and plywood 
to veneer and shingles. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, more than 150 of those timber jobs have been lost. Some, such 
as the 80 at the Pleasant Valley Plywood Inc. plant, will return when raw 
material prices drop so the mills can again turn a profit. Others, including 
the 65 at the Sweet Home Sawmill, are gone forever. 
</P>
<P>
However, the impact of this is not easy to gauge. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Woodward of Pleasant Valley Plywood said most of his laid off workers 
have found other jobs, though many commute to Eugene, 50 miles away. Meanwhile, 
former Sweet Home Sawmill hands have been hired at a new Willamette Industries 
facility that custom-finishes timber for shipment to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
There are at least 20 empty storefronts along the two main streets in town, but 
pro-logging activist Gayle Davis said many closed for reasons unrelated to the 
spotted owl debate. Some closed during a nine-week millworkers' strike last 
year, she said, and others have been hurt because industrywide wage cuts force 
families to shop at discount chain stores in nearby Lebanon or Albany. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, there is a sense of anxiety in Sweet Home. It grows daily, as 
independent loggers such as Robert L. Rice and Jean Reynolds cut closer to the 
end of existing contracts. Many have no prospects beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds, for example, felled trees for a Simpson Timber Co. mill in Albany 
that has been permanently closed. The timber Reynolds is cutting was purchased 
before the Simpson mill closed; the logs are sold on the open market. When she 
completes her current assignment next month, Reynolds said she also will close 
down. Her 12 loggers and five truck drivers will be looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
"I've looked around, and everything is real tight," she said. "Some will work 
at a loss, just to keep up payments on their equipment. I've decided that if I 
cannot make money (on a job), I won't log it. I should be able to hang on until 
spring. Maybe there will be something then. Maybe." 
</P>
<P>
Industry supporters say the problem is that so much of what could be logged has 
been placed off limits by court orders. Rood said federal judges have tied up 
40% of all of Linn County's timber sales. 
</P>
<P>
As more loggers are idled, saw log supplies fall and threaten to force mills to 
close. Sometimes this is because banks are reluctant to loan money unless a 
mill can show that it will be open long enough to pay it back. At other times, 
mill operators do not know if they will have anything to cut at all. 
</P>
<P>
"Our lead time in logs is now lower than I have ever seen it," Rood said. He 
said some Willamette Industries sawmills in Sweet Home have a 10- to 12-day 
supply waiting on their log decks, or storage areas. Others have 30- to 40-day 
supplies. A comfortable margin is at least 60 days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
With supplies short, prices have soared. At one salvage sale in Eugene last 
week, $14.1 million was bid for timber appraised by the Forest Service at $7.6 
million. The Northwest Forest Resource Council said such bids are unprofitable 
and were probably made by companies desperate for cash to service their debts. 
</P>
<P>
"With no Forest Service timber, it is putting pressure on private land and 
people are cutting timber before it is mature because it is profitable," said 
Rice, an independent logger. 
</P>
<P>
The council and others believe that the signs indicate that the real crunch 
will arrive before autumn, and they worry that this winter will be worse than 
the timber depression of 1982. 
</P>
<P>
That may be hyperbole, but even experienced loggers such as Rice talk about 
lightening their debt load for a long dry spell. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm thinking about is what I should be doing right now to prepare," he 
said, looking up at a $500,000 yarding tower he recently bought to speed up the 
loading of log trucks in the forest. "Like, maybe I should unload that to 
someone who can use it." 
</P>
<P>
"But we employ 40 people today -- that is 40 families," interjected Rice's son, 
Chris, who earned a pharmacist's license to give himself an income in the lean 
times. "If we did that (sell that equipment), we would put 40 people out of 
work. And this is no time to be out of work." 
</P>
<P>
The uncertainty already is tangible to Sweet Home merchants. They said they 
have noted a dip in sales of recreational vehicles and other luxury items with 
monthly payments. Bankers report a decline in consumer loans. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether we get a paycheck from a logging company or not, we all know that we 
depend for part of our income on the industry," said Cheryl Keenan, branch 
manager for Key Bank in Sweet Home. "If the timber industry goes, there's not 
much left for Sweet Home. We are not a very diverse economy." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes anxiety spills into anger. Many cars in town have anti-owl bumper 
stickers: "Save a Logger/Eat an Owl" or "I Like Spotted Owls . . . Fried." At 
the Sportsman's Holiday parade last Saturday, one float used an owl doll to 
depict its slogan: "I'll Drown Anyone Who Takes My Job." 
</P>
<P>
Pro-logging grass-roots activists wince at such talk. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't really appreciate owl-bashing," Rood said. "People who wear T-shirts 
about fried owls and things -- well, it's funny but it's not really what we are 
about." 
</P>
<P>
"The owls are not our enemy," Kunzman said. The opposition, he and others make 
clear, are preservationists who have crippled their industry in court. 
</P>
<P>
"They have their hands around my throat," Kunzman said. 
</P>
<P>
"And my throat," said Conrad, his second-in-command. 
</P>
<P>
"And the throats of everyone in Sweet Home," Kunzman added.

FRENCH DANCE, SING TO LAUNCH BIRTHDAY FETE

France's biggest party in 200 years got off to a roaring start Thursday night 
with wild dancing in the streets, an inaugural performance in the stunning new 
"people's" opera house at the Place de la Bastille and a nasty little tiff with 
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
As President Bush, French President Francois Mitterrand and 32 other world 
leaders watched from balcony seats at the costly and controversial new Bastille 
Opera, across the square from the site of the prison that was demolished at the 
start of the French Revolution in 1789, the orchestra broke into a rousing 
version of the "Marseillaise" to begin a program of selections from French 
operas, including George Bizet's "Carmen" and Camille Saint-Saens "Samson and 
Dalila." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
100,000 Celebrants 
</P>
<P>
Two hours after the early evening performance, after the 34 leaders and their 
34 fleets of bullet-proof limousines and escort cars had finally departed, the 
Bastille Square filled with more than 100,000 celebrants. As rock music blared 
from a temporary stage erected next to the new opera, the cool night air filled 
with smoke from exploding firecrackers and sizzling sausages cooking on open 
grills. 
</P>
<P>
By midnight, the square was too packed for anyone to truly dance, and the 200th 
birthday party had evolved into a kind of adolescent-style happening. Still, 
there were about 30,000 other bals populaires taking place all over France on 
the eve of Bastille Day where traditional dancing -- tangos, polkas and waltzes 
-- and accordion music could be found. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Bastille Day, Parisians will be treated to the annual military parade 
down the Avenue des Champs Elysees as well as a wacky $15-million nighttime 
parade, featuring elephants, oil-can drummers and dancing bears, that was put 
together by eccentric French-American advertising man Jean-Paul Goude and 
rehearsed secretly on a French air force base. 
</P>
<P>
The focus of events Thursday night was the Bastille Opera. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have described the $400-million glass-and-concrete building, designed 
by Canadian architect Carlos Ott, as looking like a "ship in dry dock." 
President Mitterrand is known to detest the design and prefers reading to music 
anyway. The new opera was at the center of an international controversy when 
music director Daniel Barenboim was fired in January. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
15-Minute Ovation 
</P>
<P>
But none of this seemed to matter Thursday night as Bush, his wife Barbara, and 
most of the other national leaders and their spouses joined in an enthusiastic 
15-minute standing ovation for opera singers Placido Domingo, Barbara 
Hendricks, June Anderson and others who performed on the technologically 
advanced new stage. 
</P>
<P>
As his gift to the new opera house, Bush presented Mitterrand with an original 
key to one of the cells at the Bastille Prison. 
</P>
<P>
The key was originally given to George Washington by the Marquis de Lafayette, 
but since 1858 it has been the property of the Mount Vernon Ladies Assn. The 
association is lending the key to France for the Bicentennial. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, many of the 2,700 people in the audience turned to applaud 
mitterrand, the 72-year-old french leader who is taking advantage of the 
bicentennial to show off several of his monumental building projects, including 
the opera, a $300-million pyramid addition at the louvre museum and a 
$500-million arche de la defense, which will be the main site of the 
seven-nation economic summit this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
One world leader who did not appear to be having as much fun as the others was 
Britain's Thatcher, who was met with boos and hostile whistles from the crowd 
on at least two occasions Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of her visit here Thatcher was interviewed by the newspaper Le Monde 
and a French television network. In her remarks, she managed to outrage the 
French government and much of the citizenry by saying that the 1789 Declaration 
of the Rights of Man and Citizen, the centerpiece of the Bicentennial 
celebration, did not originate with the French. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly not," the British leader said on the Antenne-2 network, "They date 
back much further than that. We have our own Great Charter (Magna Carta) of 
1215 and the notion of human rights goes back to the ancient Greeks and even 
further." 
</P>
<P>
In the interview in Le Monde, Thatcher took a swipe at the extravagantly 
festive, self-congratulatory celebrations being staged by the French to honor 
the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a peaceful revolution in 1688," she said, "in which the Parliament 
imposed its will on the monarchy. We celebrated this event last year, but 
discreetly." 
</P>
<P>
The French found nothing discreet about these comments. She was heartily booed 
as she left a short noontime event at the Palais de Chaillot honoring the 
French Rights of Man. She was booed again by a large crowd along the barricades 
of the Place de la Bastille when she left the opera house in her armor-plated 
limousine after the performance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thatcher in Back 
</P>
<P>
Intentionally or not, the Mitterrand government placed the British leader in 
the back rows of the assembled world leaders at both the Rights of Man ceremony 
and the opera performance. Her motorcade was also one of the last allowed to 
leave the opera house area, behind even that of Zaire leader Mobutu Sese Seko, 
the self-described "supreme guide" of his country, who came to Paris without an 
invitation. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of dictator Mobutu has caused a minor stir among some of the other 
Third World nations. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of us came to celebrate the Revolution," said a member of the 
delegation from India. "He came to celebrate The Terror." 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand felt that by inviting the Third World leaders to the Bicentennial 
celebrations, he could foster dialogue between them and the leaders of the 
group of seven leading industrial democracies, including Bush, who will begin 
meeting here this evening. He was also sensitive to the charge that it might be 
considered poor taste to host a meeting for the world's seven richest nations 
on the anniversary of France's popular uprising. 
</P>
<P>
But despite his efforts, he has been forced in recent days to defend not only 
his celebration but also the French Revolution itself. 
</P>
<P>
"For those of us who serve the Republic and democracy," he said in an interview 
with the American ABC television network, "the 14th of July is our fete." 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to charges that he had turned the Bicentennial into an imperial-style 
event, with lavish meals and gala events such as the Bastille Opera opening, 
Mitterrand said: "When you receive friends, you put your house in order. You 
put flowers in the vases. You organize a dinner that is a little bit better 
than an ordinary family meal. That does not mean you are receiving your friends 
in an imperial fashion." 
</P>
<P>
According to the official estimates of the French government, the costs of the 
Bicentennial festivities will exceed $70 million. The total cost of the 
building projects -- the Louvre pyramid, the opera and the Arche de la Defense 
-- will exceed $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the celebration is at the center of the continuing feud between 
Mitterrand and his main political foe, Gaullist party leader Jacques Chirac, 
who also happens to be mayor of Paris. The Mitterrand government charges that 
Chirac ran up a bill, paid for by the national government, of more than $13 
million on one 90-minute party June 14 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of 
the Eiffel Tower. 
</P>
<P>
Chirac says Mitterrand is exaggerating the numbers to hide his own excesses. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding today's parade and other events planned here, the mayor of Paris said 
Thursday, residents "would be wise to leave town."

A Chinese man arrested after being interviewed on ABC television about the 
military assault in Beijing was sentenced to 10 years in prison. The man, Xiao 
Bin, 42, a factory worker from Dalian, was identified and apprehended after 
Chinese television showed the interview. He was accused of "spreading 
counterrevolutionary lies." In Sichuan province in central China, two men were 
executed for offenses during rioting in early June in response to the violence 
in Beijing. Their deaths brought to 29 the number reported executed since the 
crackdown.

President Bush and other Republican leaders who say they want to reach out to 
blacks should "put up or shut up" on civil rights, Democratic National Chairman 
Ron Brown told the NAACP on the fifth and final day of the group's annual 
convention in Detroit. "We hear new words from the Republican Party," said 
Brown, the first black to head the Democratic National Committee. "In politics, 
as in poker, there's a phrase for it. I believe it's time that we tell George 
Bush, Dan Quayle, (Housing and Urban Development Secretary) Jack Kemp, (GOP 
National Chairman) Lee Atwater and the rest of those Republicans it's time to 
put up or shut up." Kemp and Quayle addressed the convention earlier in the 
week.

Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis cut nearly half a billion dollars from 
the state budget in a move he said was made necessary by "miscalculations, 
mistakes and misinformation." He said the needy would be hurt the most, and he 
renewed his call for a tax increase. The spending cuts in the $12.3-billion 
budget include a $210-million reduction in aid to cities and towns, a freeze in 
welfare benefits and a $62-million cut in public and higher education spending. 
Dukakis, whose state's budget problems have called into question the 
"Massachusetts Miracle" he touted during his Democratic run for the presidency, 
had argued for six months for tax increases to avoid such cuts.

Millions of Iranians chanting "Death to America!" and beating themselves in 
ritualistic grief surrounded the gold-domed tomb of the Ayatollah Ruhollah 
Khomeini, ending days of mourning for the founder of the Islamic republic. 
Speeches by his religious successor, President Ali Khamenei, who appeared in 
public for the first time since Khomeini's June 6 funeral, and other Iranian 
leaders directed a tirade against the "terrorists" of the United States and its 
allies. The official IRNA news agency said 10,000 people packed in around the 
Behesht Zahra Cemetery collapsed with "heart problems" or were injured in the 
suffocating throng, while 10,000 more were overcome by the 110-degree 
temperature.

Hundreds of striking union miners were arrested for blocking a road to a 
non-union mine in West Virginia, and rock-throwing pickets in Kentucky injured 
the president of a coal company. Coal officials criticized Gov. Gaston Caperton 
and state police, charging they had let strikers in West Virginia get out of 
hand. "There is a total state of chaos," said A.T. Massey Coal Co. spokeswoman 
Deborah Herndon. In Prenter, W. Va., state police arrested 277 of the 500 
strikers who blocked the road leading to the non-union Elk Run Coal Co. Elk Run 
is a subsidiary of A.T. Massey. Rocks were thrown at another A.T. Massey 
subsidiary, Sidney Coal Co. in Sidney, Ky., and company president Charles 
Snavely was hit in the face with a rock. The strike began April 5 when 1,900 
United Mine Workers members walked out in a contract dispute with Pittston Coal 
Group.

A tanker carrying desperately needed fuel for Lebanon's besieged Christians 
broke through a Syrian blockade, sparking heavy artillery battles in Beirut. 
Police reported three people killed and 10 wounded in shelling duels that raged 
for hours, further undermining cease-fire efforts by Arab League envoys. Police 
said the tanker docked at the port of Byblos, 19 miles north of Beirut, 
triggering a fierce Syrian bombardment as it begun unloading its cargo. 
Christian army gunners retaliated, firing at the Syrian batteries in Muslim 
West Beirut.

A body that washed ashore near a southern Mexican village six weeks ago has 
been tentatively identified as that of an American employee of the U.S. Agency 
for International Development who had been on a hiking trip, officials in 
Washington said. Dental records appeared to confirm that the victim was Frank 
Fairchild, 43, who went to Guatemala on a hiking trip alone in May and crossed 
into Mexico on June 1. The remains have been sent to Mexico City for further 
examination. Fairchild's body washed ashore at Puerto Arista and was buried by 
local authorities. Mexico informed the State Department, which requested that 
the body be disinterred after it was learned that Fairchild, who was born in 
Los Angeles, was missing.

TELEVISED HIGH COURT HEARINGS BACKED; 
</P>
<P>
PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING WOULD BE ENHANCED, STEVENS BELIEVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens said Thursday that public 
understanding of the high court would be enhanced if proceedings in some of its 
major cases were televised. 
</P>
<P>
"In my view, it's worth a try," Stevens said on the final day of the annual 9th 
Circuit Judicial Conference at the Ritz-Carlton in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens said that several cases have prompted such great public interest that 
court-watchers have stood in line for hours hoping to gain admission to oral 
arguments inside the high court building in Washington. "I thought it was sad," 
Stevens said, that the court had not allowed the proceedings to be televised. 
</P>
<P>
Jesse Choper, dean of the law school at UC Berkeley, said that Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist has been considering the possibility of televising court 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
Timothy Dyk, a Washington lawyer who represents a dozen news organizations, 
including ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC, said the networks conducted a demonstration at 
the Supreme Court last November. The goal was "to show the advances that have 
been made in technology and how it is possible to cover the court without 
disruption," Dyk said. 
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist and Associate Justices Byron R. White and Anthony M. Kennedy attended 
the demonstration, Dyk said, but did not express an opinion. Dyk said news 
reports have suggested that some justices are favorably disposed to the idea. 
And in a reply to a letter from journalists in April, 1986, Justices Stevens, 
Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan went on record in approval of 
televised hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist's predecessor, Warren Burger, was unalterably opposed to allowing 
Supreme Court proceedings to be televised. Burger said the presence of cameras 
would have a negative effect in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Under questioning by two federal judges and a Los Angeles lawyer, Stevens 
avoided such controversial topics as the court's recent decision upholding a 
Missouri law that bans abortion in public hospitals and forbids public 
employees from assisting in abortions. Stevens was one of four dissenters in 
that case. 
</P>
<P>
He did respond, however, to a question from U.S. Judge Mary M. Schroeder of 
Arizona about fractious relations among the Supreme Court justices. Several 
justices have strongly criticized their colleagues in written opinions this 
term. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is unfortunate that we sometimes get carried away in our views of 
our colleagues," Stevens responded. 
</P>
<P>
"It's poor advocacy in opinions. . . . It sets a bad example, and it does not 
reflect the true personal relations in the court," Stevens added. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that Brennan, one of the court's most liberal members, and Justice 
Antonin Scalia, on the conservative side, "have disagreed strongly" in 
opinions. But "they're the best of friends, they get along beautifully," 
Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about what role the public should play in the judicial process, Stevens 
said he thought it had an "important function" in jury trials. However, Stevens 
expressed reservations about the need for federal judges to stand for 
reelection, as those on most state courts must do after their initial 
appointments. Federal judges have lifetime appointments from the President. 
</P>
<P>
"I have strong feelings, that for the sake of the process itself . . . 
appointment and tenure have a value that far exceeds the value of election," 
Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
During a panel discussion, Stevens said he thought that a judge who did not 
have to stand for reelection might have responded differently to Cincinnati 
Reds Manager Pete Rose's suit challenging the impartiality of Baseball 
Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti. 
</P>
<P>
A Cincinnati trial court judge, who faces reelection next year, has issued a 
temporary injunction barring Giamatti from holding a hearing on whether Rose 
violated major league baseball rules by gambling on games. Further hearings are 
scheduled later this month in an Ohio federal court. 
</P>
<P>
In a matter of considerable interest to the 300 judges and lawyers gathered 
here, Stevens said that, for the present, he saw no need to split the 9th 
Circuit, the largest of all the federal circuits. 
</P>
<P>
There has been a move afoot, spearheaded by Sen. Slade Gorton (R-Wash.), to 
split the circuit, which stretches from Guam to Montana and includes nine 
states. Senators from the Northwest have said the circuit is too large and 
excessively dominated by California judges. 
</P>
<P>
At the conference, a resolution urging that the circuit not be split was 
overwhelmingly approved by judges. 
</P>
<P>
"As of now, if it isn't broke, you don't need to fix anything," Stevens said.

STATE OFFICIAL TOPS CANDIDATE ROSTER FOR INS WESTERN POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ben Davidian, the chairman of the California Agriculture Labor Relations Board, 
is the leading candidate to succeed Harold Ezell as the top federal immigration 
official in the West, a Justice Department spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
David Runkel, chief spokesman for U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, said 
Davidian, a 38-year-old GOP activist and longtime supporter of California Gov. 
George Deukmejian, is being seriously considered for nomination as Western 
regional commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Davidian 
is a former Sacramento lawyer with admittedly no experience in the complicated 
and politically charged immigration field. 
</P>
<P>
A nominee for the key Western post could be named before the confirmation of a 
permanent successor to ousted INS Commissioner Alan Nelson, the agency's top 
official. 
</P>
<P>
"His (Davidian's) naming will be sooner rather than later," Runkel said, in 
response to questions during a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Gene McNary, the chief elected official of St. Louis County, Mo., has been 
reported for several months as the Bush Administration's choice to replace 
Nelson, but he has not yet been formally nominated. 
</P>
<P>
Runkel declined further comment, but other ranking officials within the Justice 
Department, which oversees the INS, said Davidian in recent days has 
leapfrogged over a Republican Latino from Orange County, former Yorba Linda 
City Councilman Rudolph Castro, as the apparent choice to succeed the 
flamboyant Ezell, whose pro forma resignation as INS Western regional 
commissioner was accepted Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"He's impressed a lot of people that he would be a good political appointment," 
one INS official said. 
</P>
<P>
The post is a key one since the immigration agency is in the midst of handling 
the second phase of the 1986 amnesty law. More than 60% of the 3 million 
immigrants who applied for legal resident status are in the INS' Western 
region, which includes California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and the Pacific 
island of Guam. 
</P>
<P>
Davidian, a Fresno native whose paternal forebearers came from Armenia, has 
been chairman of the politically sensitive ALRB for the last 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
He was appointed by Deukmejian during a time that conservatives and growers 
complained that the quasi-judicial, five-member panel was too sympathetic to 
complaints filed by the United Farm Workers of America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Complete Turnaround 
</P>
<P>
Since that time, farm-labor advocates have charged that the board has made a 
complete turnabout and has not supported UFW-initiated elections for 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
Union officials, who did not respond to phone calls late Thursday, have said 
they do not bother to file complaints with the state panel, now dominated by 
Deukmejian appointees, because of its alleged bias against farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
The ALRB, created in 1975, considers cases of unfair labor practices and 
disputes surrounding farm union-representation elections. 
</P>
<P>
Reached by telephone in Sacramento, Davidian confirmed that he has sought 
appointment within the Bush Administration, but said he did not know if the INS 
post was among the jobs he was being considered for. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be honored to serve in the Bush Administration," said Davidian, who 
has worked in the campaigns for Deukmejian, former President Ronald Reagan and 
other Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Davidian said his lack of first-hand experience in immigration policy should 
not be considered a handicap. 
</P>
<P>
"The criticism of me (when he was named to the ALRB) was the fact that I had no 
agriculture and labor law background," he said. "But an individual like me can 
come in with a clean slate and no preconceived notions. That's why I was 
appointed." 
</P>
<P>
But that was of little comfort for immigrant-rights advocates, who contended 
that a career INS officer was better suited for the post. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Davidian would be a serious mistake," said attorney Peter Schey of the 
National Center for Immigrant Rights Inc. in Los Angeles. "It would give us 
several more years of INS leadership by persons or a person unfamiliar with 
immigration laws and policies." 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Davidian, however, said the one-time Air Force captain is ideally 
suited for the post. 
</P>
<P>
"He has the kind of personality that can bring different factions together," 
San Diego attorney Pat Shea said. "He doesn't have the exotic personality of 
the predecessor."

ASSEMBLY ETHICS PANEL BALKS AT MAKING FPPC A LEGISLATIVE WATCHDOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Assembly Select Committee on Ethics, contending that legislators should 
police themselves, rejected a proposal Thursday to give an outside enforcement 
agency -- the Fair Political Practices Commission -- the power to watch over 
lawmakers' conduct. 
</P>
<P>
Attempting to piece together a code of ethics for the Legislature, the panel 
agreed to restrict the size of honorariums and gifts legislators may receive 
but stopped short of imposing a ban on such outside payments. Ultimately, the 
panel agreed that honorariums should be banned if legislators receive a 
corresponding salary increase. 
</P>
<P>
The decisions came during the third in a series of unusual public meetings in 
which the panel is drafting new rules designed to clean up the tarnished image 
of the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange) has been indicted on a 
charge of forgery and Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) has been indicted on 
charges of extorting payment of honorariums in exchange for action on specific 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're all about here is trying to improve the image of this body (the 
Assembly)," said Assemblyman Robert C. Frazee (R-Carlsbad), who sits on the 
newly created Ethics Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, several members of the committee expressed the view that problems 
of conflict of interest and payment of honorariums are not as serious as some 
outsiders have suggested. 
</P>
<P>
"There really isn't that big a problem with conflict of interest," said 
Assemblyman William H. Lancaster (R-Covina), a member of the panel and chairman 
of the virtually dormant Joint Legislative Ethics Committee. 
</P>
<P>
And Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara) argued that the ethical 
problems posed by the receipt of speaking fees from groups with an interest in 
legislation "pales" when compared to the much larger amounts of campaign 
donations doled out each year by the same interests. 
</P>
<P>
One of the key issues facing the committee Thursday was whether to bring in the 
Fair Political Practices Commission to enforce conflict-of-interest laws in the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
Because of a loophole in the Political Reform Act of 1974, legislators are 
exempt from outside enforcement of laws prohibiting them from voting on matters 
in which they have a financial interest. By contrast, local elected officials 
throughout the state are subject to scrutiny and potential fines by the Fair 
Political Practices Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Legislature has its own joint ethics committee with the power to 
look into conflict-of-interest allegations, it has shown an extreme reluctance 
to investigate members of the Legislature. Under Lancaster's chairmanship, the 
committee has met only twice since 1985 and has not initiated any 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Assemblyman Ted Lempert (D-San Mateo), who ran on a platform of ethics 
reform, urged his colleagues on the panel to bring in the political watchdog 
commission to take action against any legislator who has a conflict of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
"If we are going to be serious about reform in this area, we should put the 
Legislature in line with other elected officials and have FPPC enforcement," he 
said. "If we're going to leave conflict of interest to the in-house ethics 
committee, then we're not really changing anything." 
</P>
<P>
But by a vote of 7 to 1, Lempert's proposal was rejected. Instead the committee 
decided to broaden the jurisdiction of the Joint Legislative Ethics Committee 
so that it could become more aggressive in policing members. 
</P>
<P>
Vasconcellos and other members of the panel argued that the Legislature should 
not give an outside agency the authority to investigate its members. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not about to do that to myself or anybody else," Vasconcellos said. "I 
think we can police ourselves adequately." 
</P>
<P>
In dealing with the issue of outside income, the panel voted to place an annual 
limit of $1,000 on all honorariums and gifts to a legislator from a single 
source. Honorariums could not total more than one-third of a legislator's 
salary, which is now $40,816. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, honorariums would be paid only for substantive appearances, not 
simply for meeting with an interest group. Legislators who receive an 
honorarium would have to report their scheduled appearance at least a week in 
advance and afterward provide the newly constituted ethics committee with a 
transcript or tape recording of their speech. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, the panel agreed it would favor an outright ban on honorariums 
and a limit on earned outside income equal to one-third of a legislator's 
salary. However, the committee agreed that such restrictions would have to be 
linked with a constitutional amendment creating an independent panel that would 
have the authority to substantially increase legislators' salaries.

GOVERNOR GETS HELMET BILL; VETO PROBABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The Assembly, with no debate and not a Hells Angels member in sight, on 
Thursday passed and sent to the governor a bill to require all motorcycle 
riders to wear safety helmets. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is nearly identical to one vetoed a year ago by Gov. George 
Deukmejian, and the governor indicated earlier this week that he will probably 
reject this measure as well. 
</P>
<P>
That expectation likely accounted for the quiet swiftness with which the 
Assembly acted Thursday on an issue that in past years has generated long, 
acrimonious debates and prompted scores of motorcycle club members to encircle 
the Capitol in protest. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, by Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson), was approved on a 41-20 
vote, the bare majority needed for passage in the 80-member Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to mandating the use of helmets, the measure would require the 
California Highway Patrol to report annually on whether helmets reduced 
injuries and deaths from motorcycle accidents. The helmet requirement would 
expire in 1994 unless extended by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeks a Meeting 
</P>
<P>
Floyd, a combative, outspoken lawmaker who last year cursed Deukmejian on the 
Assembly floor after the governor vetoed his bill, said he will seek a 
face-to-face meeting with the Republican chief executive before he acts on the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like very much to sit down with him and have an opportunity one-on-one 
to discuss it," Floyd told reporters. "I think if I get a chance to talk to him 
and he listens to other people, being a fair guy, he is going to sign it." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Beermann, a spokesman for Deukmejian, said the governor's office had 
received Floyd's request for a meeting but had not had "an opportunity to fully 
review it." 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has said he would favor requiring helmets for riders younger than 
21, because "the majority of accidents involve young, relatively inexperienced 
operators." Deukmejian reiterated his opposition to a broader mandate at a 
press conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
But Floyd, citing California Highway Patrol statistics, said only 23% of 
motorcycle accident deaths in the state in 1987 involved victims younger than 
21. 
</P>
<P>
"That leaves 77% who are over 21," Floyd said. "That doesn't make a lot of 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Floyd estimated his chances of getting the governor to sign the bill are 
"1 in 99." He said he expects the governor to be swayed by arguments from 
Republican opponents of the bill, celebrities and motorcycle club members who 
have spoken out against the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"The extreme conservatives on this floor in legion with the movie industry guys 
and the Hells Angels seem to be quite a combination," he said.

UNDERWATER VOLCANO SPEWS SMOKE AND ASH OFF JAPAN

<P>
An underwater volcano erupted Thursday off central Japan, spewing plumes of 
smoke and ash into the air and creating tremors that shook the Izu Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
There were no reports of injuries or damage, but callers jammed telephone lines 
for hours after the eruption a mile off the coast at Ito, a seaside resort 62 
miles southwest of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Ito's 72,000 residents fled, and city officials were considering 
evacuating people living near the shore, according to the Japan Broadcasting 
Corp. The Central Meteorological Agency issued a navigation warning to ships in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
The volcano erupted at 6:30 p.m. on the ocean floor at a depth of several 
thousand feet, the meteorological agency said. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we don't know if this will lead to another, larger eruption and can 
only tell people there to watch for further warnings," said an agency official. 
"Obviously, there could be danger to Ito if a larger eruption occurs," he said, 
requesting anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese archipelago is of volcanic origin, and 80 volcanoes are believed 
to be active. 
</P>
<P>
For hours after the eruption, calls to Ito police and City Hall were met with 
recorded messages asking callers to try later because of "extremely crowded 
lines." 
</P>
<P>
Along with the strong jolt of the eruption, slight tremors, possibly caused by 
the volcano, were felt throughout the evening, said the official from the 
meteorological agency. 
</P>
<P>
Seismologists were surveying movements of underground magma in the area. Large 
movements of magma can cause earthquakes, which often preceed volcanic 
eruptions. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 earthquakes have been recorded around Izu over the past two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
An official of the Seismic Division of the Central Meteorological Agency, who 
spoke on condition of anonymity, said the nature of the quakes had changed 
since Tuesday night, with the most recent quakes occurring more frequently and 
lasting up to 20 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Between June 30 and noon Thursday, 22,328 temblors were recorded off the Izu 
Peninsula, the meteorological agency said. Most were at depths of two to 4.5 
miles under the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one people suffered minor injuries when two earthquakes registering a 
magnitude of 5.5 struck Ito on Sunday.

A military plane carrying a 20-member Soviet military delegation and Vietnamese 
officials crashed in Vietnam, killing all but two of those aboard, a Vietnamese 
Embassy spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have much official information, but yes, the plane crashed and there 
are only two survivors, both badly injured," said the spokesman who asked not 
to be further identified. 
</P>
<P>
The official said the plane crashed Saturday on a flight between Hanoi and Da 
Nang on the east coast of central Vietnam, where the United States maintained a 
major air base during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
He said a 20-member Soviet delegation visiting Vietnam was aboard along with 
Vietnamese military officials, but he did not know the total number killed or 
the nationality of the survivors. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, Kyodo News Service quoted "reliable sources" as saying those killed 
included the 20 Soviets and several Vietnamese officers. 
</P>
<P>
Most Vietnamese military and civilian aircraft are Soviet-made, but there was 
no indication of the type of craft involved in the crash.

CUBAN WAR HERO, 3 OTHERS EXECUTED BY FIRING SQUAD

<P>
Cuban war hero Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez, who fought alongside Fidel Castro in 
the revolution 30 years ago, was executed by firing squad at dawn Thursday 
along with three other officers after being convicted in a $3-million 
drug-smuggling and corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Their deaths, reported by the Cuban news agency AIN, came as no surprise to a 
nation that for a month watched the progress of the trial on television. 
</P>
<P>
The drug scandal has stunned and embarrassed Castro and his Communist 
government, which for years denied U.S. accusations that Cuba was being used to 
smuggle drugs into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Found guilty of treason and sentenced to death by firing squad by a 
three-member military court last Friday were Ochoa; a former Interior Ministry 
official, Col. Antonio de la Guardia; a secret police official, Maj. Amado 
Padron, and Ochoa's military aide, Capt. Jorge Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
"Today at dawn a sentence dictated by a special military tribunal was carried 
out against the accused," said Prensa Latina, identifying the four without 
further comment in a dispatch from Havana. 
</P>
<P>
The four former officers, who were arrested in June, were also found guilty of 
drug trafficking and hostile acts toward foreign nations. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, Cuba's Supreme Court and its Council of State, which is headed by 
Castro, refused to overturn the sentences. The Cuban leader later declared that 
even if he had the power he would not stop the executions. 
</P>
<P>
They four were among 14 senior military and Interior Ministry officials 
convicted by the tribunal of embezzlement and helping Colombia's notorious 
Medellin drug cartel smuggle six tons of cocaine into the United States. They 
were said to have accepted at least $3.4 million in bribes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Smuggled Other Goods 
</P>
<P>
The officers were also convicted of black marketeering and smuggling diamonds, 
ivory, sugar, fine wools, manufactured goods and U.S. dollars. 
</P>
<P>
All admitted guilt but asked for mercy based on their records and contrition. 
The other 10 officers, including one woman, were sentenced to terms that ranged 
from 10 to 30 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
Two Cabinet ministers also were fired in the crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
The death sentences were carried out despite appeals for clemency from Pope 
John Paul II, Amnesty International and other human rights organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinary life virtually came to a halt during televised proceedings that began 
June 12. Cubans gathered around their sets in fascination not just at the drug 
scandal but also because of the scenario of unbridled greed that unrolled. 
</P>
<P>
The trial was shown nightly on national television. Cubans watched as Ochoa, 
dressed in his general's uniform, with Cuba's highest decoration, Hero of the 
Republic of Cuba, pinned to his jacket, said: "One pays for treason with one's 
life." 
</P>
<P>
For many Cubans, the trial was traumatic. The 57-year-old Ochoa was a 
much-decorated and popular hero who most recently commanded the victorious 
Cuban forces in Ethiopia during its war with Somalia that began in 1978 before 
becoming chief of the Cuban military mission in Angola.

SOVIETS WELCOME NATO PROPOSALS TO CUT FORCES

<TEXT>
<P>
The Soviet Union on Thursday welcomed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's 
new proposals to reduce conventional forces in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Oleg A. Grinevsky, chief Soviet negotiator at the talks on cutting 
conventional forces on the Continent, said he hopes that the new ideas, first 
suggested by President Bush at the NATO summit in May, will "promote rapid 
progress," and he promised that they will be carefully studied. 
</P>
<P>
The NATO proposals, dealing with numbers of troops and aircraft, were presented 
to the Warsaw Pact nations earlier Thursday, the final day in the current round 
of talks. The proposals came about two months ahead of schedule, leading one 
veteran Western negotiator to describe the pace as "almost breathtaking." 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told a news 
conference that the Soviet Union regards the proposals as "serious and 
constructive and meeting our proposals halfway," Reuters news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been counterproductive to delay these proposals until September 
-- this gives us an extra two months," Gerasimov said. "We shall do everything 
we can to reach these agreements within six months." 
</P>
<P>
Although welcoming the ideas, Grinevsky noted here that they were previously 
stated at the Brussels summit. He also complained that NATO's objections to 
excluding Soviet jet fighter interceptors as part of the cuts in air power in 
Europe were "totally at odds" with the concept of restricting the Vienna talks 
to offensive weapons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defining 'Defensive' 
</P>
<P>
The disagreement over including what the Soviets call defensive warplanes among 
the arms reductions is expected to be a major sticking point in the East-West 
conventional talks here. 
</P>
<P>
The Western proposals added to the overall agenda important new cuts in combat 
aircraft, combat helicopters and troop strength. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, the total number of military categories under discussion in Vienna was 
raised Thursday to six -- along with the previous elements of battle tanks, 
heavy artillery and armored troop carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Grinevsky was full of praise for the progress of the talks, which began early 
this year. "Up to now, there has been great progress," he told a news 
conference here. 
</P>
<P>
And despite his reservations about some of the new NATO proposals, he said it 
is possible to reach agreement next year, "if all sides are ready." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not afraid of difficulties," he added. "I'm afraid when difficulties are 
not resolved." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets insist that their air interceptors are totally defensive and should 
not be included in the totals of combat aircraft to be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
The NATO position is that an interceptor, although defensive, could be 
reconfigured within hours to become an offensive attack bomber. As Stephen J. 
Ledogar, Washington's chief negotiator at these talks, put it: "If it's 
combat-capable, it's a combat aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
In the package presented Thursday, NATO negotiators proposed a reduction of 
combat aircraft in Europe to 5,700 planes and 1,900 helicopters on each side 
and a reduction of U.S. and Soviet troops stationed in Europe to 275,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
According to NATO, the new level for combat aircraft would represent a 15% cut 
below NATO's current level and almost a 60% cut below the East Bloc's level. 
The current helicopter levels on both sides are apparently close to the desired 
figure. By NATO's calculations, setting a ceiling of 275,000 troops would mean 
removing 30,000 American soldiers and 325,000 Soviet troops. 
</P>
<P>
To help verify reductions, NATO proposed that aircraft and helicopters 
withdrawn from service should be destroyed, as tanks, artillery and troop 
carriers would be under earlier proposals. 
</P>
<P>
In his remarks, Soviet negotiator Grinevsky complained that British, French and 
Canadian forces based in West Germany were left out of proposed reductions. 
</P>
<P>
And he specifically criticized the NATO package for omitting the category of 
light tanks, those under 26 tons. The Soviets believe that all tanks should be 
included in reductions since, as Grinevsky argued, modern technology could in 
the future upgrade smaller tanks to the effectiveness of current main battle 
armor. 
</P>
<P>
The talks, formally known as the Conventional Forces in Europe talks, reconvene 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cruise Missile Plan 
</P>
<P>
In another arms-control development, a senior Soviet military official in 
Moscow said his nation is willing to give up all cruise missiles deployed at 
sea with nuclear warheads if the United States does the same, according to the 
Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
The remark by Col. Gen. Nikolai F. Chervov, chief of the arms-control 
directorate in the Soviet military's general staff, represented a departure 
from the Soviet position at the superpower arms negotiations in Geneva. That 
position was that each side could retain up to 400 of the winged, pilotless 
missiles with nuclear warheads and 600 with conventional warheads. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has long resisted limiting these weapons at all on the grounds that 
inspectors cannot readily monitor them. The dispute has been a major obstacle 
to a new treaty reducing strategic arms.

<P>
ECONOMIC SUMMIT LIKELY TO FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENT

PARIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is billed as the 15th annual economic summit of the leaders of the seven 
largest industrial democracies, but this year's session, on Saturday and 
Sunday, is likely to focus more on environmental issues than the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Although there are plenty of international economic problems for the leaders to 
grapple with, President Bush and the leaders of the six other nations lack both 
the money and the political will to do much about them. So for the record, they 
are saying the global economy is doing well and does not need any tinkering. 
</P>
<P>
"The truth of the matter is that economic conditions around the world are very, 
very good, taking the broad view over time," U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas 
F. Brady asserted last week. "You don't want to change the throttle settings 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, this will be the Year of the Environment -- or, at least the year of 
talking about environmental issues -- according to the advance billing that 
officials of the seven participating countries have provided over the last few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, told 
reporters last week that "there is even something of a race . . . by some of 
the economic summit participants to be . . . the greenest of all." 
</P>
<P>
An advance draft of the communique that the leaders are expected to issue at 
the summit's end Sunday declares that "decisive action is urgently needed to 
understand and protect the Earth's ecological balance." 
</P>
<P>
With Bush eager to be seen as the "environmental President," U.S. officials say 
they want the Paris summit to "lay the groundwork" for further action at next 
year's economic summit, which will be held in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time that a summit address our natural heritage, and let Paris then be 
known as the summit which accepted the environmental challenge," Bush said in a 
news conference before he left Washington for Poland and Hungary late last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"This is basically an agenda-setting summit," said Robert D. Hormats, a former 
State Department economic strategist and now vice chairman of Goldman Sachs 
International, a New York investment banking house. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
France's Third 
</P>
<P>
The summit rotates every year, with each country -- the United States, Japan, 
West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- taking its turn as host. The 
current session will be the third in France, and it is timed to coincide with 
today's celebration of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Paris is under a double strain: the tight security imposed to help 
protect the seven heads of government, which has closed off much of the center 
of the city, and today's anniversary gala, which is attracting throngs. 
</P>
<P>
The summit sessions will be held at the top of a stark, arch-shaped modern 
building called the Arche de la Defense, a pet project of President Francois 
Mitterrand, situated about two miles northwest of the Arc de Triomphe. Still 
not finished, it was filled with workers late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The conference room itself, on the 35th floor, contains the customary oversized 
round granite-and-wood table built to accommodate the seven heads of 
government, their foreign ministers and their finance ministers, the only 
persons allowed inside the closed-door sessions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Top Issues 
</P>
<P>
In this setting, the summit leaders will discuss a range of environmental 
issues: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Global warming. Leaders of all seven summit countries are under new 
pressure from their constituents to take steps to reduce emissions of carbon 
dioxide, which scientists now blame for the so-called greenhouse effect, the 
gradual warming of the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Third World deforestation. The industrial countries worry that the 
disappearance of the rain forests is depriving the global environment of 
oxygen-producing trees and increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide 
around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The ozone layer. The seven leaders will seek to reinforce an accord reached 
at a Montreal conference in 1987 to help stem the depletion of the ozone layer 
in the stratosphere, which is being eaten away by chlorofluorocarbons, such as 
those that are used in spray cans. 
</P>
<P>
 -- International problems. The leaders will be groping for ways to heighten 
international cooperation in dealing with pollution problems such as ocean 
dumping that transcend national boundaries. In the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil 
spill in Alaska, they also may reinvigorate earlier efforts to improve 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
How far the seven heads of government will go, however, remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Several European countries, notably West Germany and France, have proposed the 
creation of a new international organization that would be empowered to require 
countries to adopt specific regulations designed to help blunt the global 
warming trend, mainly by limiting the use of fossil fuels. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl sent a letter to President Bush 
calling for a worldwide convention to discuss long-term climatic trends, 
leading to "internationally binding obligations for limiting carbon dioxide 
emissions." 
</P>
<P>
But officials concede that the summit most likely will not produce any sweeping 
new agreements to regulate fuel consumption or emissions. Both the United 
States and Britain are adamantly opposed to creating any new international 
regulatory agency and will not participate in one. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the seven leaders are likely to call mainly for stepped-up monitoring 
of the situation and, possibly, for a new international conference later this 
year to discuss proposals to eliminate chlorofluorocarbons by the end of the 
century. Bush grudgingly endorsed that plan earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
For all the emphasis on the environment, the leaders will not ignore economic 
issues entirely. They are expected to discuss topics such as the continuing 
global trade imbalances; the Third World debt situation; the threat of renewed 
inflation; the new, more aggressive U.S. trade policy; international aid for 
Poland and Hungary; a more liberal restructuring of Poland's debt, and a 
coordinating mechanism to channel the aid to the two Eastern European 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
Although few decisions are expected, the summit is unlikely to be free of 
friction on economic issues. The United States is expected to lock horns with 
Europe and Japan over how much more the industrial nations should do to reduce 
the current global trade imbalances -- America's trade deficit and the others' 
corresponding surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
Washington wants its two major trading partners to bolster demand at home so 
that their consumers and businesses will buy more U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
But the others are reluctant to do so for fear of aggravating inflation, which 
is already accelerating at home. They urge the United States to trim back its 
federal budget deficit, which would leave more of the nation's savings 
available to finance the business investment that is needed to boost production 
capacity and spur productivity. 
</P>
<P>
Bush also may run into some embarrassment over the Treasury Department's new 
Third World debt strategy, which has yet to show any concrete results after 3 
1/2 months in operation. The scheme has been dubbed the Brady plan after the 
U.S. treasury secretary, who is its author. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury had hoped to be able to tout a debt-reduction accord between 
Mexico and commercial banks as a symbol of the Brady plan's success, but 
despite months of negotiations the two sides still are only edging toward an 
agreement in principle. (On Thursday, the United States said it is prepared to 
provide Mexico with a temporary "bridge" loan after talks are completed. Story 
in Business, Page 1.) 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand, never shy about trying to upstage the United States, invited 
leaders of about 30 Third World countries to an eve-of-summit dinner Thursday 
to discuss the debt situation, with the aim of calling for a world conference 
on the debt issue later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Although Mitterrand is not expected to succeed, the summit's endorsement of the 
Brady debt-reduction plan is considered likely to be tepid. Many critics fear 
that the strategy will not be able to provide enough relief to ease economic 
and political tensions in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
And despite the roller-coaster ups and downs of the dollar so far this year, 
the seven are unlikely to do anything to tighten the international 
exchange-rate system. Although France has been pushing for stricter limits on 
currency movements, the United States and others oppose any such move.

PRESIDENT COMES AWAY FROM EASTERN EUROPE WITH 'BUSH DOCTRINE' TAKING FORM

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For those with any memory of the bad old days in Eastern Europe, President 
Bush's journey through Poland and Hungary this week was nothing short of 
astonishing -- from the Warsaw lunch at which Communists and once-jailed 
opposition leaders joined in toasting the United States, to the Hungarian 
military band that saluted Bush with a spirited rendition of "The Stars and 
Stripes Forever." 
</P>
<P>
"(The) change is absolutely amazing," Bush marveled aboard Air Force One as he 
left Eastern Europe on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've been witnessing in the last three days," added Brent Scowcroft, the 
President's national security adviser, "is a really historic set of 
developments in the postwar world." The surge of reform in Poland and Hungary, 
Scowcroft said, has brought about "a fundamental change in the whole 
international structure." 
</P>
<P>
In return, Bush outlined a striking new U.S. policy toward Eastern Europe, an 
approach that some enthusiastic aides are already calling "the Bush Doctrine." 
</P>
<P>
Its central idea, as Bush said in a speech at Karl Marx University here, is to 
offer "the partnership of the United States" in the effort to dismantle 
Stalinism in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The concrete financial-aid component in Bush's proposals was modest: $125 
million to promote private enterprise in the two countries; smaller amounts of 
cultural and environmental assistance, plus a promise to seek help from the 
other Western nations in relieving their economies' crushing burden of foreign 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
But the underlying changes in U.S. policy have been extraordinary, and many 
Poles and Hungarians recognized it. 
</P>
<P>
"The new attention from the West is important to us," said Gyorgy Kadar, a 
Hungarian democratic activist. "It helps guarantee that the process of reforms 
will continue." 
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Iron Curtain descended over Eastern Europe after the end of 
World War II, the United States has treated the Soviet satellites as just that 
-- satellites. U.S. relations with Poland and Hungary reflected the state of 
relations with the Soviet Union. Even when the United States declared a policy 
of "differentiation" in the 1970s, it was largely an exercise of giving small 
rewards to those satellites, such as Romania, that made life most difficult for 
their masters in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Now, however, Bush has raised the U.S. commitment to Hungary and Poland 
considerably, declaring himself a full partner in their efforts to reform. The 
accent is on treating Poland and Hungary as if they were independent, in part 
to see how far their autonomy can be extended. And so far, Bush noted, "there 
doesn't seem to be a bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the U.S. goal appears to be nothing short of a "rollback" of 
communism in Eastern Europe. But unlike the belligerent policy that bore that 
name in the 1950s, this rollback would be peaceful, infiltrating Communist 
territory not with spies or troops but with Western-oriented economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The theory, Bush aides say, is that more and more Communist rulers will follow 
the lead of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in deciding that economic 
reforms require political reforms as well -- and that political reforms will 
inevitably draw once-Western countries such as Poland and Hungary back into 
what Bush calls "a Europe whole and free." 
</P>
<P>
"A market-oriented economy and a vigorous private sector can provide the 
foundation for a more democratic political system," one senior Administration 
official said. Or, as Lenin might have put it, the idea is to help the 
Communists of Eastern Europe improve their economies -- so they can produce the 
rope to hang themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, in another departure from the policies of the past 40 years, the 
Bush approach is not aimed at ending Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe -- at 
least, not openly. Instead, Bush took pains all week to say that he was not 
campaigning to detach Poland and Hungary from the Soviet Bloc or stir up 
trouble for Moscow. " . . . We're not there . . . to poke a stick in the eye of 
Mr. Gorbachev," he said Thursday. "Just the opposite -- to encourage the very 
kind of reforms that he is championing, and more reforms." 
</P>
<P>
So intent was Bush at getting this message across that several Polish and 
Hungarian officials said they were startled at how often he volunteered it. And 
some members of the two countries' democratic opposition movements were a 
little dismayed at the President's insistence on patient and gradual change. 
</P>
<P>
More than one member of Poland's Solidarity movement grumbled about Bush's 
praise for Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Communist leader who outlawed their 
union and jailed many of their leaders after declaring martial law in 1981. 
Bush called him "a man of serious purpose trying very hard to move his country 
forward," and added, "He's come a long way since 1981." 
</P>
<P>
And in Hungary, opposition leaders had said they had hoped to win Bush's 
endorsement of their call for a total withdrawal of Soviet troops from the 
country. Instead, they found the President assuring them that the issue was 
being dealt with in East-West negotiations on conventional forces. 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. officials have even argued that Poland and Hungary can -- and should 
-- attempt to democratize without leaving the Soviet Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
"Our involvement in Eastern Europe has no political-military dimension," one 
senior White House aide asserted. 
</P>
<P>
But opposition activists in both Poland and Hungary made it clear that they 
would like to lead their countries out of the Warsaw Pact, if they thought they 
could do it without provoking Soviet intervention. 
</P>
<P>
As in the rest of the Administration's campaign for a new system of U.S.-Soviet 
relations, dubbed "beyond containment," officials remain deliberately imprecise 
over what political and military structures should replace the familiar ones of 
the Cold War. "We're feeling our way step by step," a State Department official 
said. But he acknowledged that the Administration has deliberately avoided 
calling for an end to the Warsaw Pact, for example, because that would endanger 
the incremental progress that has already been made. 
</P>
<P>
Americans, Poles and Hungarians all agree on two factors that are needed to 
make the policy work. One is the forbearance of Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
"The support of President Bush is important to us," said Kadar, the Hungarian 
activist. "I hope you will not be offended if I say the success of Mr. 
Gorbachev is very much more important." 
</P>
<P>
The other is whether the new U.S. commitment to two Communist countries in 
economic distress can be sustained in an era of tight federal budgets. The 
first test will come this weekend, at the Paris economic summit, where Bush 
expects to win agreement from the world's other wealthy democracies for more 
liberal terms on debt relief for Poland and a general commitment to increased 
investment and aid. 
</P>
<P>
But officials acknowledge that the job will take a considerable amount of money 
and a long time -- especially to revive the moribund Polish economy.

MOTHER CONVICTED AS DRUG DELIVERER AFTER COCAINE IS FOUND IN NEWBORNS

An addict who gave birth to two children with traces of cocaine in their 
systems was convicted of drug delivery Thursday under a law routinely used 
against drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
"A derivative of cocaine which the defendant had introduced into her body 
passed into theirs" through the umbilical cord, Circuit Judge O. H. Eaton Jr. 
ruled in the non-jury trial. 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Clarise Johnson, 23, faces up to 30 years in prison, but prosecutor 
Jeff Deen said he would recommend that she continue in a drug-treatment program 
and receive a long period of probation. 
</P>
<P>
Deen said the verdict is "a new tool for prosecutors to put a stop to this 
great problem in this state and in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
A key issue in the case was whether a newborn is a person after birth but 
before the umbilical cord is severed. The state made that argument to justify 
prosecution under a law making it a felony to deliver drugs to minors. 
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced and find that a child who is born but whose umbilical cord has 
not been severed is a 'person' within the intent and meaning" of Florida law, 
Eaton said. He ruled also that the term "delivery" includes passage of cocaine 
through the umbilical cord after birth.

PANEL REJECTS STEALTH CURBS, OKS FUNDING

Despite growing congressional opposition to the stealth bomber, the Senate 
Armed Services Committee Thursday rejected a proposal by Sen. John Glenn 
(D-Ohio) to save an estimated $1 billion by slowing down production of the 
expensive new aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
The committee vote means that the Administration's request for $4.8 billion for 
the bomber in fiscal 1990 will be referred to the full Senate without any 
reduction. The House Armed Services Committee recently voted to slash $800 
million from the stealth program for fiscal 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Glenn's proposal would have created a series of "milestones" or specific 
hurdles over which the stealth program would be required to pass before 
receiving additional funds for the next stage of its development -- the first 
being that it must be able to fly. 
</P>
<P>
He estimated that his proposal could have saved the government about $1 
billion. It is now expected that the government will spend at least $70 billion 
if the Pentagon buys all of the 132 bombers it seeks. 
</P>
<P>
Like many other stealth opponents, Glenn has argued that the bomber should not 
be fully funded until it has been proven effective. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest departure in aircraft design, ever," he said. "Why go into 
it -- at a cost of $538 million per copy -- without seeing if it can fly 
first?" 
</P>
<P>
The vote on Glenn's proposal took place in a closed session of the Senate 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Northrop Corp., which has been developing the boomerang-shaped bomber -- also 
known as the B-2 -- is preparing for the craft's maiden flight, perhaps as 
early as Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the setback, Glenn vowed to revive his proposal to slow down B-2 
production when the fiscal 1990 defense authorization bill is considered on the 
Senate floor later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of Glenn's proposal have argued that a production slowdown actually 
would cost more money than it would save. Air Force officials testified before 
the House Armed Services Committee Wednesday that the program would cost an 
extra $4.2 billion if Congress withheld production funds for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the stealth have also argued that the aircraft represents a 
bargain for the government in comparison to the alternatives. Air Force 
officials contend that it would cost $60 billion to scrap the stealth program 
and instead buy sufficient numbers of B-1 bombers to perform stealth's intended 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told the House Armed Services 
Committee that the $800-million cut in funding that that panel had agreed on 
recently could add as much as $1.4 billion to the stealth program's price. 
</P>
<P>
Cheney defended the B-2's soaring cost but warned lawmakers in a hearing that, 
if Congress makes yearly cuts in B-2 budget requests, the cost would spiral out 
of control. 
</P>
<P>
"You might decide you want to cancel the program," he said. "That would be a 
perfectly legitimate decision . . . (although) I think it would be wrong. But 
what you should not do is nickel-and-dime-it to death." 
</P>
<P>
When asked about the consequences of cancellation, Cheney said: "If, in fact, 
we do not go forward with the B-2, we will not have the capacity that we had 
anticipated in terms of the number of weapons we would be able to deliver to 
the Soviet Union in wartime."

KOCH AIMS FOR ENSHRINEMENT IN N.Y. POLITICAL HISTORY

<TEXT>
<P>
In the fall of 1956, a young lawyer with a growing taste for politics carried 
an American flag to street corners in Greenwich Village, and wherever he could 
draw a crowd, he preached the election of Adlai E. Stevenson for President. 
</P>
<P>
It was a seminal experience, good basic training amidst the traffic and the 
turmoil for what would come later. 
</P>
<P>
"You can really make great points when there are hecklers in the audience," 
Edward Isidore Koch reminisced in his memoirs. "The only kind of heckler you 
can't use is the drunk. The others, the ones who want to debate you, are 
terrific. I love them. I became politically active then and there." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Already Running Hard 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, 33 years later, Koch announced for a fourth term as mayor of New 
York. His declaration on a local radio program was a formality. He had been 
running hard for a year, some say for most of his life. 
</P>
<P>
"Ladies and gentlemen, I am running," Koch, 64, said from his office at City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that your formal announcement?" a reporter asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm an informal guy," Koch deadpanned. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous reelection campaigns where he won with over 70% of the vote, 
the mayor clearly is the underdog, suddenly thrust against the reality of his 
political mortality. 
</P>
<P>
Only two other mayors, Robert F. Wagner Jr. and Fiorello H. LaGuardia (Koch's 
hero) ever governed New York City for three terms. David Garth, the mayor's 
good friend, confidant and campaign strategist, said Koch's bid for a fourth 
term "is the difference between making the All-Star team and making 
Cooperstown," referring to the site in Upstate New York of the Baseball Hall of 
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"He wants to make Cooperstown. If he has to go out, he'd rather go out 
fighting. He understands the reality. He may not like it, but he faces it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Time Getting Scarce 
</P>
<P>
The reality is difficult, and the innings are beginning to slide by quickly on 
Koch's field of dreams. 
</P>
<P>
New York's Democratic primary is Sept. 12. The latest polls show Manhattan 
Borough President David N. Dinkins, who is seeking to make history of his own 
by becoming the city's first black mayor, with 45% of the vote -- five points 
above the threshold to avoid a runoff. Koch, in the latest Daily News/WABC-TV 
poll, trails with 31%. 
</P>
<P>
Equally serious, only 37% of registered Democrats gave Koch a positive job 
rating -- an amazing slide judged against the euphoria of his first two terms 
in office. 
</P>
<P>
For millions of Americans west of the Hudson, Koch over almost a dozen years 
has come to symbolize New York City: brash, brawling, tough and tumultuous. His 
autobiography "Mayor" was a best seller. His many appearances on television 
ranging from "The Tonight Show" to "Saturday Night Live" have made him a 
national celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's mouth, his detractor's charge, is his most prominent political 
feature. He gloats in his victories, glories in his enemies defeats. 
</P>
<P>
It got him in big trouble when he declared during the 1988 presidential primary 
in New York that "Jews have got to be crazy to vote for Jesse Jackson." The 
mayor later apologized. 
</P>
<P>
Victories have been very few in his third term, which has been marked by 
charges of corruption in government, chaos in some neighborhoods caused by 
crime and crack, homelessness and simmering racial tension. Voters began to 
forget Koch's work that helped bring the city back from the brink of bankruptcy 
in the 1970's. Koch's ability to identify with the city's worst problems as if 
he were an ordinary citizen, not the public official most responsible for 
solving them, began to wear thin. 
</P>
<P>
Atop all this, Koch suffered a small stroke. It left no paralysis or diminution 
of faculties, but Koch's physicians told him he'd had a close call: The stroke 
was just a hairbreadth away from the motor area of his brain. 
</P>
<P>
The task for Koch over the next eight weeks is clear: drive Dinkins below 40% 
and get to play in extra innings in a runoff on Sept. 19. It will be a tricky 
exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Current polls show almost three quarters of black Democrats voting for Dinkins 
in the primary, which leads Koch's advisers to believe that the mayor can't 
attack the 61-year-old borough president with full vigor for fear of losing the 
black vote in November's general election. U.S. Atty. Rudolph W. Giuliani, 44, 
who is expected to win the Republican primary, will also appear on the 
Independent and the Liberal Party ballots in an effort to make his candidacy 
palatable to disaffected Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of attacking Dinkins, the mayor has engaged Giuliani in political 
combat whenever possible, hoping the perception will grow that Koch, not 
Dinkins, is the only Democrat tough enough to defeat the former prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the mayor has been running commercials stressing his 
achievements in minority neighborhoods. One set of commercials features black 
and Latino residents praising the city's $5.1-billion effort designed to create 
252,000 units of affordable housing -- the largest municipal building program 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still the second toughest job in America," the tag line proclaims, 
attempting to tie together Koch's achievements with the oblique charge that 
Dinkins is too weak to sit behind the mayor's desk at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Koch's advisers hope Richard Ravitch, a 55-year-old builder 
and former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and city 
Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, 53, remain in the Democratic primary. Even 
though both are polling in single digits, their endorsement of Dinkins, if they 
dropped out of the race, could be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor's advisers also hope that Dinkins will become the subject of 
increasing media scrutiny. Dinkins failed to file federal, state and city 
income tax returns for 1969 through 1972 -- which he admitted when he withdrew 
as a potential candidate for deputy mayor in 1973.

Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) did not receive favored treatment from banks 
that lent him $1.6 million for his unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic 
presidential nomination, the Federal Election Commission reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the loans were taken out around March, 1988, when a large number of 
primaries were held in the South. The Tennessee senator had pinned much of his 
hopes for winning the nomination on those primaries. 
</P>
<P>
Election commission auditors initially questioned whether some of the banks had 
received enough collateral and assurances of repayment. Gore's campaign argued 
that the loans had been repaid in full, which should serve as proof of the 
soundness of the decision to lend the money.

The population of the 12 European Community countries has risen to more than 
325 million, but almost half the increase in the past year is due to 
immigration, the statistical office Eurostat said Thursday. On Jan. 1, 1989,

The bear was sighted at about 1 a.m. near Chimney Rock, midway up Kingsbury 
Grade, which leads to the Stateline casino district along the south shore, 
Douglas County Sheriff's Sgt. Al Baumruck said.

The Senate Rules Committee has served notice on Gov. George Deukmejian that it 
wants people other than white, male hunters appointed to the state Fish and 
Game Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The committee of three Democrats and two Republicans agreed to send Deukmejian 
a letter "imploring" him to appoint women, ethnic minorities and 
representatives of conservationist organizations to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The issue surfaced at the conclusion of a confirmation hearing Wednesday for 
fish and game Commissioner Albert C. Taucher, a retired Long Beach sporting 
goods store operator who was reappointed to a second term. The committee 
approved the appointment and sent it to the floor on a 3-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, among other things, sets policy guidelines for the state Fish 
and Game Department, regulates hunting and sport fishing and has increasingly 
become involved in preservation of wildlife habitat and protection of non-game 
species. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Nicholas C. Petris (D-Oakland) noted that the commission consists of five 
white males, all of whom are hunters. He said he favors more diversity, 
including appointment of members who represent environmental organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. William Craven (R-Oceanside), who suggested a letter to the governor, said 
he believes Deukmejian should appoint "people who are not necessarily 
protagonists of the hunt, (but) people who have great feeling for the animals, 
their habitat and their well being." 
</P>
<P>
Senate Leader David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), committee chairman, announced 
that he will not vote for appointees to the commission "unless they are 
balanced." He said it is important that the commission members reflect the 
gender and diverse ethnic composition of California. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's executive secretary, Harold C. Cribbs, confirmed that all five 
commissioners are white males and said they "primarily hunt waterfowl and 
upland game birds." 
</P>
<P>
As a group, he said, hunters "are as much mainstream conservationists in 
California as you'll find."

OFFICIAL SAYS OFFSHORE DRILLING MAY NOT BE NEEDED

A California energy commissioner told a presidential task force on offshore oil 
development Thursday that drilling on two controversial California coast sites 
"may not be necessary" in the near future because there are substantial 
reserves of onshore oil. 
</P>
<P>
Energy Commissioner Richard A. Bilas told the President's Outer Continental 
Shelf Leasing and Development Task Force that deposits of oil in the state are 
much larger than those off the coast. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that reserves in Kern County alone may be three times greater than 
reserves offshore," Bilas said. 
</P>
<P>
Bilas, chairman of the commission's fuels planning committee, made the remarks 
at the last of 10 hearings held by the task force around the country since May. 
President Bush established the task force in February to examine concerns over 
proposed oil drilling leases in three environmentally sensitive areas, two of 
which are off the California coast from Santa Barbara and Marin counties. 
</P>
<P>
Energy Commission Chairman Charles R. Imbrecht said later that "our position is 
we don't believe any energy option should be foreclosed," including offshore 
oil. But he said the development of onshore resources may pose fewer problems 
than offshore sites. 
</P>
<P>
"We spend a lot of both time and energy debating offshore resources when we 
have onshore resources that can be developed in an environmentally acceptable 
fashion," Imbrecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force winds up its hearings while Congress is debating offshore 
drilling in general. The House this week approved a measure that would shut 
down drilling along much of the nation's shoreline, including all offshore 
drilling in California. The fate of such legislation is in doubt, however, 
because it is opposed by the Bush Administration. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, Bilas told the task force that reserves in the Central Valley 
are made up of heavy crude oil, requiring high-pressure steam to retrieve. 
Because of the cost of the recovery process -- called "thermal enhancement" -- 
the onshore reserves have been tapped in the past primarily when oil prices on 
the world market have risen, Bilas said. 
</P>
<P>
"But now, in light of the environmental concerns, it makes sense to get the 
thermally enhanced oil first," he said after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
Some groups opposed to offshore drilling because of the danger of oil spills 
say the thermal enhancement method of onshore production is not only safer for 
the environment, but also has other advantages. 
</P>
<P>
A fringe benefit is that heat from the recovery process can be used to generate 
electricity, said Gerald Meral, executive director of the Planning and 
Conservation League. "It is turning out to be a major source of electricity," 
he said.

According to Energy Commission figures, 59% of California's oil supply comes 
from in-state sources, 33% from Alaska and 8% from foreign sources. Bilas said, 
however, that oil from Alaska may account for as little as 20% by 2005 as that 
state's resources decline. Because of the expected change, California will have 
to continue to develop its own reserves, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"California does not want to be forced into relying more on foreign imports to 
meet its petroleum requirements," Bilas said.

LATEST TESTS SHOW NO TRACE OF OIL IN SLICK FROM TANKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coast Guard tests released Thursday showed no evidence of oil in an offshore 
slick probably caused by the Exxon Valdez, contradicting earlier state tests 
that confirmed that the tanker's discharges were petroleum-based. 
</P>
<P>
Exxon Shipping Co. officials welcomed the announcement. But Coast Guard 
officials downplayed those results, and state authorities insisted that the 
substance leaked in the 18-mile slick discovered 30 miles offshore Monday was 
in fact oil. 
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Alaska state officials said the Valdez trailed a 
1-mile sheen of oil as it left Prince William Sound on June 23. 
</P>
<P>
"They definitely trailed a sheen, and we definitely believe it was oil. It's 
probably similar to what you have off the coast right now," said Bob Flint, 
regional program manager for the Department of Environmental Conservation in 
Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
The slick off San Diego, on Monday within a mile of the Valdez, and two smaller 
discharges that leaked from the tanker Tuesday and Wednesday, have dissipated, 
Coast Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
However, new discharges were reported to be coming from the ship Thursday 
morning, and officials said they would keep the ship about 50 miles from the 
San Diego coast and continue to lower it in the water until the discharge 
stops. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Continuing Mystery 
</P>
<P>
The continuing mystery about the discharge meant that the Valdez was no closer 
to resolving the problems that have delayed its entrance into San Diego Bay for 
repairs. Before the ship can enter the bay, divers must remove as many as five 
huge steel plates that have peeled downward from the hull and wouldn't clear 
the bottom of the bay. Before that can happen, the discharge has to stop so the 
tanker can receive permission to move to a protected area closer to the coast 
to make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Cmdr. Frank Scarborough said preliminary Coast Guard tests had 
found no oil in samples of the slick, but could not explain the discrepancy 
between that finding and the opposite conclusion reached Tuesday by the the 
state Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
"The tests indicate no presence of oil, but some unidentified organic matter," 
Scarborough said. "But we're still assuming we have discharges of oil." 
</P>
<P>
One fish and game department scientist said state tests might be more fallible 
than those of the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
"Our laboratory had inherent limits on its ability to identify crude oil," said 
Greig Peters, an environmental specialist with the state water quality control 
board, which analyzed the original samples. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the true test is whether this stuff is going to be toxic or not. And 
we won't get a good sample until divers can actually get inside and take 
scrapings off the inside of the vessel." 
</P>
<P>
But other officials rebuffed Thursday's test results. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on preliminary lab results, appearance, smell, feel . . . based on 24 
years of experience with oil, yeah," it's oil, said Reed Smith, pollution 
response coordinator with the Fish and Game Department. 
</P>
<P>
Scarborough said that, to prevent further discrepancies, scientists from the 
Coast Guard, state and federal agencies, and Exxon have formed a single team to 
test more samples of the original and subsequent discharges coming from the 
tanker. Gary Patrae, a scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration, arrived Wednesday to head that team, Coast Guard officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, officials Thursday still had not determined where the ship could be 
taken to remove the five steel plates jutting from the tanker's hull. 
</P>
<P>
Although Pirate Cove near San Clemente Island appears to be the primary choice, 
officials also are considering Long Beach as a removal site. Pete Bontadelli, 
director of the fish and game department, said Thursday in San Diego that 
removing the plates in Long Beach poses less risk to the marine environment 
than the San Clemente Island site. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Conditions Demanded 
</P>
<P>
State politicians continued to demand that Exxon meet certain conditions before 
entering state waters to remove the steel plates from its hull, and kept the 
possibility of a lawsuit against the oil company hovering. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, head of the state Lands Commission, late Thursday said 
Exxon had verbally agreed to commission demands expressed Wednesday, but he 
wants a written confirmation of that agreement. 
</P>
<P>
The demands included no pollution of state waters by the Valdez, no leaking for 
a 24-hour waiting period or when the ship is moved for removal of the steel 
plates and a contingency plan provided by Exxon to prevent or clean up any 
spills. 
</P>
<P>
Growing involvement by state and federal politicians and agencies clarified on 
Thursday, as the state Fish and Game Department was acknowledged as the lead 
representative for all state agencies. But the decision on what happens to the 
tanker, officials stressed, remains with the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
Scarborough, who has had that responsibility, today will hand it over to Cmdr. 
Don Montoro. Scarborough is retiring and will be moving to Miami to teach 
business classes at a small Catholic university. 
</P>
<P>
The giant tanker hit a reef in Alaska on March 24 and spilled millions of 
gallons of oil, fouling hundreds of miles of pristine Alaskan shoreline, 
killing thousands of animals and upsetting the fishing industry. 
</P>
<P>
The crippled Valdez arrived off the coast late Sunday from Alaska, and was to 
have docked Tuesday morning at the National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co. in San 
Diego Bay for a $25 million, nine-month repair job.

PEDESTRIAN AND AUTO BRIDGE AT WESTSIDE MALL PASSES HURDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN MURPHY, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a major defeat for homeowners opposed to expansion of the Westside Pavilion 
shopping mall, the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Commission gave preliminary 
approval Thursday to a bridge over Westwood Boulevard that would connect the 
existing mall with a proposed annex. 
</P>
<P>
The 48-foot-wide bridge -- roughly half the width of a typical freeway -- would 
be the first in the city to carry both traffic and pedestrians over a city 
street as part of a commercial development, Los Angeles officials said. Other 
private bridges in the city, including those at the Bonaventure Hotel and the 
Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, serve pedestrians only. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cluttered Skyline 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very bad precedent for this city," said Laura Lake of the Westside 
Home Owners Alliance, a coalition of five homeowner groups near the mall that 
wanted a pedestrians-only bridge. Lake and others argued that the traffic link 
is unnecessary and said they fear such bridges, particularly near residential 
neighborhoods, will clutter Los Angeles' skyline. 
</P>
<P>
In approving the bridge, commissioners followed the advice of city 
transportation officials, several consultants, architect Jon Jerde, City 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky and residents from a sixth nearby homeowners group. 
All agreed the bridge offered the best hope of relieving traffic congestion in 
the area by permitting cars to move from the mall to its 105,000-square-foot 
annex without using surface streets. The annex will also provide 1,000 
additional parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't want this bridge. We didn't go out and say, 'Hey guys, why don't you 
put a bridge in,' " said Terry Tippit of the West of Westwood homeowners group, 
which represents residents east and west of the mall. "But given the problems 
that we've had in this area, we felt it is going to be a plus." 
</P>
<P>
The bridge has been a source of contention since it was proposed several years 
ago as part of the mall's expansion. Westfield Inc., the developer, originally 
wanted to build a larger bridge that would include retail shops. Strong 
community opposition and Mayor Tom Bradley's insistence that the bridge not 
include shops forced Westfield to scale back the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the City Council approved the expansion and the traffic bridge, but 
under city law the Cultural Affairs Commission must also approve proposals to 
build over city streets. On Thursday, the commission voted 6 to 1 to grant 
preliminary approval for the bridge. Westfield must return to the commission 
for final approval once Jerde completes the bridge's design. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Signal 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Madeleine Landry, who voted for the bridge, cautioned other 
developers not to view the decision as a signal that the commission favors such 
bridges. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we should ever look at this as being a precedent or say we are 
going to do this for every project that comes along," Landry said. 
</P>
<P>
Decisions by the Cultural Affairs Commission cannot be appealed, but homeowners 
opposed to the project have one more chance to fight it. The City Council later 
this summer will consider Westfield's request for so-called "air rights" to 
build over Westwood Boulevard. But Yaroslavsky, who represents the area, has 
given opponents little hope, saying the air rights issue is a mere technicality 
because the council and mayor have already approved the project.

GUNSHOTS BARK, AND DEATH CLAIMS A TEEN-AGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOUIS SAHAGUN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walter Stewart had just returned home from work when his 17-year-old son asked 
permission to go outside for a while. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes after 9 p.m. Wednesday, Stewart heard the unnerving bark of 
gunshots outside his South Los Angeles home. Moments later, his sister-in-law 
pounded on the front door, screaming that his 17-year-old son, Walter Dale 
Stewart Jr., had been shot dead. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart's son would have turned 18 on Thursday -- the same day that a computer 
training school representative called the family with news that he had been 
accepted into a job placement program. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they did not have a suspect or a motive in the killing. The younger 
Stewart, a senior at Locke High School, was not believed to have been a gang 
member. 
</P>
<P>
"Sad, huh?" muttered the victim's mother, Olivia Stewart. "It still seems like 
a dream to me." 
</P>
<P>
As he sadly described the events of the preceding night, Walter Stewart Sr., 
38, stared out blankly to beyond the back-yard fence of the family's small 
stucco home on the 700 block of 109th Street. 
</P>
<P>
"I ran around the corner and there he was with his face down on somebody's 
porch. The police said, 'He's going to be all right.' Maybe they should quit 
telling you that. I noticed he was still . . . still as a rock. It didn't look 
good at all." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Shot in Torso 
</P>
<P>
South Bureau Homicide Detective Pat Marshall said Walter Stewart Jr. had been 
walking along Stanford Avenue near 109th Street when he was shot in the upper 
torso by a suspect that police could only describe as a man in his 20s. 
</P>
<P>
"The victim ran 30 to 40 feet before he collapsed," Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
The gunman was seen by witnesses getting into a brown 1979 or 1980 Chevrolet 
Caprice, which sped from the scene westbound on 109th Street, Marshall said. 
"We really don't know why he was accosted by this suspect." 
</P>
<P>
Walter Stewart Jr. was one of four victims to die in the violence that erupted 
Wednesday on Los Angeles streets. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, a bloody shoot-out eight blocks from the Los Angeles 
Memorial Coliseum left two rival gang members dead and three others wounded, 
police said. More than 50 shots were fired in the gun battle that killed 
17-year-old Edward Cory Brown, investigators said. The second victim, Jerry 
Knox, 33, was struck and killed by a car during the intense gunfight. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies arrested 16 members of rival 
gangs involved in a rock, bottle and fist fight in an unincorporated area on 
Wednesday afternoon. After these arrests were made, 10 of the gang members 
walked to a nearby street in Los Angeles. There, in a drive-by incident, they 
were sprayed with bullets fired by an assailant from a rival gang, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Monolita Shawn Green, 18, of Los Angeles, was hit in the back. He died of his 
wounds at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Gang-related homicides citywide increased 39.3% during the first three months 
of this year, compared with the same period a year ago, said Police Lt. Fred 
Nixon. Similarly, gang-motivated crimes -- those growing directly out of gang 
activity -- increased 31.8% citywide in the first six months of this year, 
compared with the same period a year ago, Nixon said. 
</P>
<P>
Walter Stewart Sr. needed no statistics to tell him the problem is out of 
control. "Parents used to run the neighborhoods; the youths run the 
neighborhoods now," he said. "Whoever is supposed to be in charge of these kids 
has got to get back in control."

BISTRO OWNER'S KILLING SPARKS PATROLS, REWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LIEBERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles police announced Thursday that they have assigned additional 
officers to the fashionable Westside neighborhood where bistro owner Andre 
Coffyn was fatally shot during a robbery this week by a man who may have 
committed six similar holdups since June 24. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, calling it "the type of crime 
that sends a shiver up the collective spine," said the city will post a $25,000 
reward for information leading to the capture of the killer. 
</P>
<P>
Detectives said they are still seeking to determine whether the same man is 
responsible for a string of street holdups targeting people with Rolex watches, 
including one Wednesday in which a 60-year-old woman apparently was saved when 
the robber's gun failed to fire. 
</P>
<P>
The woman was confronted at 12:30 p.m. as she was heading from her car to a 
doctor's appointment in the 8100 block of Beverly Boulevard, within walking 
distance of the other robberies, Detective Roger Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
"He asked for the watch, and she refused," Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
"He pointed the gun toward her and the victim yelled, 'No!' 
</P>
<P>
"He pulled the trigger and it didn't go off. 
</P>
<P>
"Then she fell to the ground, yelling, 'No, no, no!' " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Frightened by Car 
</P>
<P>
Before the man could try to shoot again, a car drove by and frightened him off, 
the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Willie Pannell, who heads the Wilshire Division detective unit, would not 
disclose details of the "special deployment" ordered to catch the thief. But he 
said similar descriptions of the gunman, and the fact that the valuable Rolexes 
were sought at Coffyn's restaurant and in the street robberies, led police to 
believe at least some of the crimes are linked. 
</P>
<P>
There may be more than one man involved, Pannell said, citing "indications 
there was a driver and a getaway car" in the shooting of Coffyn "and a couple 
of the robberies." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Approval Predicted 
</P>
<P>
Yaroslavsky said police requested that a reward be offered in the case and he 
will ask the council for one Tuesday. He predicted quick approval of the 
measure. 
</P>
<P>
Coffyn, 48, was on the patio of his Michel Richard bistro, sitting with a group 
of diners, when a gun-waving man approached about 11 p.m. Monday, just as the 
restaurant was about to close, and demanded their watches and money. The gunman 
fired once, killing Coffyn, a native of France who in 1987 purchased the cafe 
at 301 S. Robertson. "He was shot for no particular reason that we can 
determine," Pannell said. 
</P>
<P>
Both Yaroslavsky and Pannell tried to head off suggestions that authorities 
might be reacting more strongly than usual to the killing because it was in an 
affluent neighborhood, as in the case of Karen Toshima, who was fatally shot 
Jan. 30, 1988 in a gang cross-fire in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Request Withdrawn 
</P>
<P>
In the Toshima case, Yaroslavsky withdrew his request for a $25,000 reward 
after several council colleagues complained that unsolved gang-related murders 
in South-Central Los Angeles had not received similar attention. 
</P>
<P>
"We offer rewards all the time, dozens and dozens of times, for exactly these 
kinds of crimes," Yaroslavsky said Thursday, "where the offer of a reward may 
lead to the apprehension of the criminal. 
</P>
<P>
"What's at issue here is the confidence a community feels," he said. "It wasn't 
an estranged couple or a drug deal gone bad. He could have been you or me." 
</P>
<P>
"I hope we have to spend the $25,000," the Westside councilman said. "My fear 
is we won't." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Composite Photo 
</P>
<P>
Police on Thursday released a composite photo of the suspect in Coffyn's 
killing, described as a light-complexioned black man in his 20s, about 6 feet 
tall and 170 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Dan Andrews said the seven crimes under investigation still have only 
been "tentatively" linked because there have been some variations in witnesses' 
descriptions of their attackers.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NO FINAL AGREEMENT IN LAND-SWAP TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Negotiations between Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City) and a representative 
of Los Angeles County concerning a complicated land-swap proposal did not 
produce a final agreement in Washington on Thursday, a Berman aide said. 
</P>
<P>
"The negotiations are ongoing," said the aide, Marc Litchman. "There's optimism 
that it can be resolved. There's still more work to be done." 
</P>
<P>
The land swap involves proposals to turn Elsmere Canyon near Santa Clarita into 
a public trash dump and to set aside strips of land across Nevada for lines 
that would carry electricity to Los Angeles from a coal-burning power plant in 
that state. 
</P>
<P>
In return, Berman proposes preserving several scenic canyons as park land, 
including three in the Santa Monica Mountains -- Mission, Rustic and Sullivan 
canyons -- that are owned by the county and the county sanitation districts. 
</P>
<P>
Under Berman's plan, the Hansen Dam Recreation Area, a run-down park in the 
East San Fernando Valley, would receive $300 million in dumping fees from the 
Elsmere landfill. In addition, the Lopez Canyon Landfill, operated by the city 
of Los Angeles above Lake View Terrace, would be closed.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: INVESTOR WITHDRAWAL DOOMS POKER CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An investor whose application to the city of Gardena to buy the Horseshoe Club 
had run into problems with both the city and state attorney general's office 
withdrew the application this week, signaling the demise of the city's oldest 
poker club. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Stern, the former president of the Commerce Casino, asked city 
officials Tuesday to withdraw his application for a transfer of an operating 
license issued by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Stern and a partner, Los Angeles attorney Leonard Baum, had proposed paying $4 
million for the club if the transfer of a city operating license had been 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
Stern declined Thursday to discuss why he requested the withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
Horseshoe General Partner Milton Corwin said the 40-year-old club, on a 
4.4-acre site at Rosecrans and Vermont avenues, was up for sale as commercial 
real estate. 
</P>
<P>
The club had about 75 to 100 employees when it closed May 23, down from a 
normal work force of about 250.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FINAL REPORT ORDERED ON GOLF COURSE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission has ordered completion of a 
final environmental impact report on a controversial project to transform a 
340-acre Malibu canyon into a private 18-hole golf course and country club. 
</P>
<P>
The $35-million project, if approved, would allow grading of more than 5 
million cubic yards of earth and the construction of 60 homes, a 
52,000-square-foot clubhouse, six tennis courts, two restaurants, a swimming 
pool and underground parking. It would be located on land recently sold by 
comedian Bob Hope to the Sun Pacific Co., a development group. 
</P>
<P>
The Malibu Country Club project is widely opposed by environmental consultants 
and homeowners' groups who want to preserve the rugged canyon area. 
</P>
<P>
Local conservationists contend that the project would threaten sensitive 
watersheds, destroy wildlife and vegetation and lead to increased traffic 
congestion.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VIETNAM VETS' GROUP STAGES VA PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dozen members of a new group called Vietnam Veterans in Recovery gathered 
outside the Veterans Administration Medical Center in West Los Angeles on 
Thursday to protest cuts in special treatment for people suffering 
post-traumatic stress disorder. 
</P>
<P>
Their complaint centered on a 2-year-old program that is being discontinued at 
the 600-acre West Los Angeles facility. The program has provided one full-time 
psychiatrist and a part-time social worker to aid those with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
Veterans Administration officials said the program is not being discontinued 
altogether but is being moved to a downtown outpatient facility at 4th and Hill 
streets. The protesting veterans argued that facility is highly inconvenient 
for them.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOY IN FIGHT IS SHOT, KILLED; GUARD HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a crowd of nearly 300 people looked on, a security guard shot and killed one 
of three boys fighting on a busy street Thursday in the jewelry district in 
downtown Los Angeles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Weldon Ivory, 42, a guard at a jewelry store at 6th Street and Broadway, was 
booked for suspicion of murder and is being held without bail at the Parker 
Center Jail, police said. He ordered the boys to stop fighting and pulled his 
pistol when they didn't, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys were fighting out in the street," said Fidel Herrera, 25, a 
salesman in a nearby store. "He told them to stop, but the guys didn't. So he 
pulled out his gun, and then it went off. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether he intended to shoot or if it went off accidentally. But 
he hit him right behind the eye," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the victim appeared to be between 17 and 19. No other 
identification was immediately available. He died instantly, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The incident began about 2:30 p.m. when Ivory confronted the three boys who 
were fighting in front of a store next door to where the guard worked, 
detectives said. After the shooting, Ivory called police, investigators said. 
Police are seeking the other two boys as witnesses.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PARK'S PLANS FOR FIREWORKS DOUSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
County fire prevention officials have doused plans for weekly fireworks shows 
at Raging Waters. Operators of the San Dimas aquatic theme park had hoped to 
present the shows every Saturday night through Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
But Assistant Fire Chief Ron Jones said the dry brush and expensive homes 
surrounding Raging Waters make it unfit for fireworks displays. 
</P>
<P>
Officials granted the park a fireworks permit for the Fourth of July 4 and sent 
a crew of fire prevention officers to monitor the show. Fire officers 
eliminated high-altitude skyrockets and pyrotechnic experts shot the fireworks 
away from the dry brush. Still, embers from the fireworks were found smoldering 
in chaparral. 
</P>
<P>
"We're lucky we didn't have a fire on the Fourth of July," Jones said. "It just 
doesn't show good judgment to shoot fireworks off into dry brush. . . . The 
people who live in that particular area were not too happy at the idea of 
fireworks."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AILING ANTONOVICH TAKEN TO HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich has been hospitalized at St. 
Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, suffering from pneumonia, his chief deputy 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Silver said he spoke to the supervisor by telephone late Thursday, and, "He 
was very chipper. He is putting in a work day over there." 
</P>
<P>
Antonovich was driven to the hospital early Wednesday, after leaving work 
Monday with a fever. Silver said a nurse took Antonovich's temperature in the 
office Monday morning, "and it was over 104" degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Silver said Antonovich's temperature was "close to normal" Thursday. He said he 
expects the supervisor to remain in the hospital through the weekend. 
</P>

ONLY 1 OF 6 ALIENS TO BE CHARGED IN PARK STABBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY MILLICAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Criminal charges will not be filed against five of the six men arrested last 
week in connection with the stabbing death of a man in Balboa Park, officials 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth man, Javier Garcia Gutierrez, 19, will be arraigned today on one 
count of murder and one count of robbery, said Linda Miller, a spokeswoman with 
the San Diego district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have the evidence on the other five," Miller said, explaining the 
decision not to press charges. Miller declined to elaborate on the evidence 
against Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
She said she believes the investigation is still continuing. The police 
investigators handling the case could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez was being held without bail in the County Jail downtown, a jail 
spokesman said. The other men have been turned over to the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez and the others identified themselves to police as Mexican nationals 
who entered the United States illegally. 
</P>
<P>
The group is believed to have been living in the canyons of Balboa Park, police 
said. The men were taken into custody July 5 in connection with the death 
earlier that day of Franklin James Black, 34, an unemployed and disabled San 
Diego resident. 
</P>
<P>
Black was found dead of multiple stab wounds after an apparent robbery attempt 
near Balboa Drive and Maple Street, police said. He was wearing only athletic 
shorts and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Officers found Black's wallet and the weapon believed used to kill him close to 
where the men were apprehended. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the men arrested had blood on their clothing at the time they were 
taken into custody, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested last week besides Gutierrez, were Juan Sanchez Valenzuela, 18; Arnulfo 
Garcia Gonzales, 21; Jamie Valdez Villareal, 22; Angel Munoz Espinosa, 18, and 
Jose Lopez Montaina, 21.

COMPTON

<P>
The report on present-day Compton ("Black Middle Class Keeps the Faith for 
Compton," Part I, June 26) and its proud residents is a lucid testimonial not 
only on pride of ownership, but also pride of community. 
</P>
<P>
The article should be read by all ethnic groups who, despite social stigma and 
stereotypes nurtured by bigots believing in "exclusive neighborhoods," continue 
to think that the latter is the sole way to go on the road to the American 
success story. The Compton story defies this. 
</P>
<P>
May there be more community-conscious individuals like those Compton folks, and 
may their tribe increase!

That "eyesore" of orange trash cans at Zuma Beach would be a welcome sight for

I have seen up to five empty bottles along side trash cans in Griffith Park. 
Surely hikers should be capable of tossing cans and bottles that far.

Trash cans with flashing neon lights might help.

JACKSON ON DEMOCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amen to Jesse Jackson's analysis of American non-voting, the institutional 
barriers to U.S. voter registration, and his plea for universal voter 
registration ("Our Languishing Democracy: To Reverse the Decline, Universal 
Voter Registration Is A Must," Op-Ed Page, July 5). What the Rev. Jackson does 
not address is the growing majority of American non-voters who look on voting 
as a futile gesture irrelevant to their personal needs. 
</P>
<P>
As an adult school counselor, I offer this suggestion in response to the 
appalling statistic provided by the U.S. Census Bureau that the largest 
demographic group of non-voters by far is that of persons between the ages of 
18 and 24, the immediate products of our high schools. 
</P>
<P>
In adult school and the senior year of high school we should offer a course 
entitled "Why vote?" The course should address immediate student problems and 
aspirations as they relate to legislation and the vote, e.g. finding suitable 
employment, continuing education toward a suitable goal, starting a family, 
military service, health needs and dangers, etc. At the end of the course 
provide registration by mail to students 18 or older, or a registration form to 
be mailed on the student's 18th birthday.

JACKSON ON DEMOCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jackson makes an impassioned plea for universal voter registration as a panacea 
for greater democracy. What he would get is massive voter fraud. Without the 
safeguards that exist in the present system of voter registration the country 
would return to the days of Boss Tweed in New York and Big Bill Thompson in 
Chicago where names on tombstones were voted with regularity. 
</P>
<P>
Back in 1950, dismayed with the voter turnout in the 1948 general election in 
which Harry Truman won California by a margin of less than 1 vote per precinct, 
I sought to become a deputy registrar and thus improve the odds for a 
Republican candidate to be elected President. I found that this involved 
attending a few hours of school on North Spring Street in Los Angeles. 
Inconvenient though it was for me as the proprietor of a one-man business, I 
attended and qualified to register potential voters. When I suggested to the 
then-county registrar of voters, Ben Hite, that a school for deputy registrars 
in remote corners of the county like Pomona might assure a bigger supply of 
applicants, he said that experience has shown that those who took the trouble 
to attend the school on North Spring Street made more dedicated deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who can't find the time to locate a deputy registrar at a shopping mall 
or even a neighborhood market isn't really trying and probably wouldn't become 
an active voter in an election; certainly not in the 80% proportion that 
Jackson claims. Unless non-voters in a general election were purged, there'd be 
a great deal more tombstone voting. So some living, potential voters would also 
be purged, but if they are so indifferent about this privilege as to fail to 
vote in a general election (not one of the many special issue elections), 
continuing them on the voter rolls would make little difference. No, what we 
need are motivated and informed voters, not mere masses of registered citizens.

SOUTH AFRICAN DIALOGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Whatever the unknown elements of the agenda may have been, the meeting between 
South Africa President Pieter W. Botha and Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned head 
of the African National Congress, was of historic consequence. It recognized 
the reality of the black majority, the need for negotiations, the inevitability 
of change. 
</P>
<P>
For Botha, 73, two months from retirement and already replaced as leader of the 
ruling National Party, the meeting culminated a cautious relaxation of 
apartheid that he has implemented. For Mandela, almost 71, perhaps close to 
release from prison, it was almost certainly the beginning of formal 
consultations in which the ANC will play a major role. 
</P>
<P>
Both Botha and Mandela emphasized the importance of peaceful change in their 
45-minute meeting. That is consistent with what the government in Pretoria has 
been saying recently about the need for change and what the ANC has been saying 
about the need to restrict the use of violence to avoid further acts of 
terrorism against civilian populations. There is, of course, no guarantee that 
peaceful change is possible at this late date, for neither Botha nor Mandela 
can control what whites and blacks will do, and neither can promise an 
equitable agreement on the future of the nation. But there is a hope that was 
not there before the two men met. 
</P>
<P>
If constructive negotiations do, in fact, result, they will coincide with moves 
elsewhere in Africa to resolve a variety of disputes with talk, rather than 
arms. There are new proposals for negotiations to end the rebellion in the 
southern Sudan and the war between Eritrean liberation forces and Ethiopia. 
South Africa has stopped sending arms to the UNITA guerrillas fighting the 
government of Angola as part of a broader peace agreement to bring independence 
to Namibia and end the Cuban intervention in Angola itself. Only the United 
States is continuing to supply lethal equipment to the Angola rebels. And in 
Mozambique, there are signs of progress in ending the murderous scorched-earth 
warfare of the RENAMO rebels. 
</P>
<P>
Most whites in South Africa apparently cling to the hope that they will be able 
to contrive a formula for the future of their country that will guarantee 
continued control by the white minority. However, the new Democratic Party, 
claiming support of 24% of the white voters, has put forward a proposal for a 
nonracial political system, with guarantees for minorities, that would emerge 
through a lengthy transition. And the new leader of the National Party, F.W. De 
Klerk, in line to succeed Botha as president after the Sept. 6, is expected to 
accelerate efforts to eliminate apartheid and extend the vote to the black 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
The clandestine meeting between Mandela and Botha is no substitute for the 
release of Mandela from prison, for amnesty, for recognition of the ANC, for 
accepting the open negotiations. As Mandela explained in a press statement 
Wednesday, a negotiated settlement is what the ANC has sought for 28 years. 
Until this latest meeting, however, the government has not seemed to understand 
that the violence it does through repression and denial of rights is as lethal 
to the cause of peace as bombs in crowded streets. Now, perhaps, the dialogue 
can begin.

IMMIGRANTS IN MACARTHUR PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite a massive police crackdown on drug dealing in MacArthur Park, you 
reported that on one recent afternoon "young men brazenly peddled bags of 
marijuana," and others openly offered crack cocaine for sale (Metro, June 25). 
</P>
<P>
Park problems are complicated by "scores of homeless people, runaways and other 
street people who are themselves either drug addicts or merely destitute." 
</P>
<P>
Later in the article you note that the area around the park is "the most 
densely populated in the city" and is "the entry point for poor immigrants from 
Central America," and that "60% of the drug arrests at or around the park are 
of Central Americans." 
</P>
<P>
Each of these statements is painfully true. 
</P>
<P>
Like the great majority of Los Angelenos I oppose drug use and drug sales. And 
I applaud every thoughtful effort to get rid of this scourge. 
</P>
<P>
But MacArthur Park is more than a story. The park is a major human tragedy. Our 
most pressing unsolved community problems surface in its 32 acres. Homeless 
people, many of whom are only teen-agers, frequent the park because there are 
few other places they can go. Despite the Immigration Reform Act and the INS, 
poor immigrants from Central America crowd the area in increasing numbers, 
seeking the same freedom from tyranny for which we so readily applaud brave 
Chinese students. 
</P>
<P>
While laws must be enforced, human tragedies cannot be solved by laws. The 
people of the park need compassion and understanding. Most are not hardened 
criminals. I have come to know many of the park's teen-agers. Together with a 
handful of volunteers, three days a week the Missionary Brothers of Charity are 
able to feed an average of 65 of the areas homeless youth, provide a place for 
them to shower, and then, painfully, we have to send them back out into the 
hopelessness they are forced to call home. Some walk an hour and a half to 
sleep at La Placita, the Old Plaza Church across from Olvera Street. Others 
risk sleeping in abandoned buildings or the park. 
</P>
<P>
I understand community efforts to "take MacArthur Park back." I can only plead 
that there be a compassionate heart to those efforts. Surely the creative 
spirit of this community can find some way to bring a measure of hope to those 
who have so little.

ROSES GROW WHERE STROLLERS DIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One year after four pedestrians were killed when a suspected drunk driver 
slammed into them at a Glendale intersection, a rose garden was dedicated to 
the memory of the victims on the median divider where the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 Glendale residents walked silently to the divider at the north 
fork of Verdugo Road and Canada Boulevard at dusk Thursday, many holding hands, 
bearing flowers and weeping softly in memory of the two young mothers and 
daughters killed on July 13 of last year. 
</P>
<P>
Valerie Cramer, 32; her daughter Brianna, 9; Patricia Carr, 36, and her 
daughter Karen, 6, were waiting on the median divider while on an evening 
stroll about 8:30 p.m. when a speeding car struck them on the unprotected 
island, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Cramer, 12, the only survivor, said during a preliminary hearing in 
January that he saw the car coming and threw himself flat before he could yell 
a warning. He suffered a broken finger and an injured knee. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Community Outraged 
</P>
<P>
The accident gave rise to widespread community anger at drunk drivers and shock 
at the deaths. In April, Glendale city officials allocated $16,000 to create 
the memorial. The plants in the garden were paid for by private donations. 
</P>
<P>
As hundreds of pink and white balloons reading "Please Don't Drink and Drive" 
were released, Bill Cramer, whose wife and daughter were killed in the crash, 
held a friend's hand and stared at the garden. 
</P>
<P>
"Before it was landscaped, I used to cry every time I went by this," Cramer 
said. "Now it's pretty. It makes it bearable. And the roses look like the 
girls." 
</P>
<P>
The garden is planted with four varieties of pink floribunda rose bushes, each 
representing one of the victims. The memorial also includes a granite plaque 
engraved with the victims' names. 
</P>
<P>
The city has since installed guard rails to protect pedestrians on the island 
and changed traffic signals to slow approaching vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The driver of the car, William K. Conway, 27, is free on bail pending a trial 
scheduled to begin Sept. 13 in Pasadena Superior Court. Conway is charged with 
four counts of manslaughter and one count of causing an accident with injuries 
while driving under the influence of alcohol.

AGOURA HILLS RULES OUT POTENTIAL FREEWAY BYPASS ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Commuters' hopes that Thousand Oaks Boulevard might someday become a freeway 
bypass between the San Fernando and Conejo valleys has run into an apparently 
permanent roadblock in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
The Agoura Hills City Council voted unanimously Wednesday to take action that 
prevents construction of a four-lane section of the boulevard through a 
semi-rural neighborhood known as Old Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
The vote means that an unpaved, half-mile section of the boulevard in Old 
Agoura will remain a narrow, bumpy stretch, dusty in summer and muddy in 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
Council members voted to give up half the city's 100-foot-wide easement for 
road construction on privately owned land through Old Agoura. The remaining 
50-foot right of way will be wide enough only for a two-lane road flanked by 
horse trails. 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks Boulevard already is a heavily used four-lane thoroughfare 
extending 7 1/2 miles between the middle of Thousand Oaks to the center of 
Agoura Hills. An isolated half-mile portion of the boulevard also exists 3 
miles farther east in the Malibu Canyon Park tract of Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, county transportation experts acquired the 100-foot right of way for 
the boulevard through what is now Agoura Hills. They hoped eventually to link 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard with Victory Boulevard at the western end of the San 
Fernando Valley, 4 1/2 miles east of the Malibu Canyon Park tract, thus 
providing an alternate to the Ventura Freeway for east-west traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The easements went to Agoura Hills when the city incorporated. 
</P>
<P>
Now, City Manager David Carmany said, the boulevard may remain unpaved forever 
because Agoura Hills cannot expand its section of the road without the 
easements. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no plans to pave it because it is a private road now. It would be up 
to adjoining property owners to improve it before we took it over," Carmany 
said. "The property owners like it the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen residents spoke during the council hearing in support of keeping the 
road as it is. Two favored widening. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists opposed turning the boulevard into a freeway bypass because 
that would help the county's plans to extend it eastward through federal 
parkland in Cheeseboro Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
After county planners began mapping the boulevard route in the 1970s, the 
National Park Service acquired Cheeseboro Canyon Park, now a popular hiking and 
equestrian area, astride the proposed route between Agoura Hills and the San 
Fernando Valley.

EPA SEEKS TO TO PUT EDWARDS AIR BASE ON SUPERFUND LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal Environmental Protection Agency Thursday proposed adding Edwards 
Air Force Base to a national priority list of hazardous waste sites that could 
endanger public health. 
</P>
<P>
Contaminants from six hazardous waste sites at the base could seep into ground 
water and threaten the drinking water of residents of the base and surrounding 
communities, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no immediate threat, but it is a potential health problem," said EPA 
spokesman Terry Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA acknowledged that the Air Force has cleaned up 15 hazardous waste sites 
on the base in recent years, part of a program that has cost $10 million since 
1981 and will cost at least another $10 million to complete. 
</P>
<P>
Don Haley, an Edwards Air Force Base spokesman, said Air Force officials are 
willing to work with environmental officials but would like to review the EPA 
findings before taking a position on Thursday's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we assess the information, if we find that it's all correct, we'll accept 
the findings," Haley said. "We don't think there's a pressing danger. But 
there's no hostility on our part. We'll continue our cleanup program whether 
we're on the national priority list or not." 
</P>
<P>
The EPA used information supplied by the Air Force and from federal and state 
health and environmental agencies in proposing Edwards and 10 other federal 
facilities in California for the Superfund National Priority List of hazardous 
waste sites. Forty-one other federal facilities are on the list nationwide, 
with another 74 federal facilities proposed for ranking as high-priority waste 
sites, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
While privately owned sites on the priority list are eligible to receive 
Superfund money for cleanup, federal facilities use money from their own 
budgets. If environmental officials decide to give Edwards Superfund priority 
after hearing from base officials and the public over the next two months, the 
EPA will oversee cleanup efforts at the base, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
Like any other government operation or private business, the base is not eager 
to be placed on the National Priority List, Haley said. 
</P>
<P>
"It creates a perception that we are harming people or things or the 
environment, and we don't feel that's the case," he said. "Our studies show 
that the ground water is not contaminated." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Priority Status 
</P>
<P>
But priority status will give the base a better chance at getting more cleanup 
funds from the Department of Defense, Haley said. 
</P>
<P>
The 800-square-mile base on the border of Kern and Los Angeles counties is a 
center of flight testing and research with a daytime population of about 
18,000. 
</P>
<P>
The six hazardous waste sites targeted by the EPA include an abandoned landfill 
and other dumping areas where fuel, nitric acid and other industrial wastes 
have seeped into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Those wastes could pose a danger to the neighboring communities of Rosamond and 
North Edwards as well as people who live and work at the base, Wilson said. 
Rosamond has a population of about 4,200 and North Edwards has a population of 
about 1,400. 
</P>
<P>
Rosamond has experienced numerous hazardous waste problems in recent years, 
with state health officials investigating a possible link between hazardous 
waste dumping and a high rate of cancer among children. 
</P>
<P>
But the EPA's Wilson said the hazardous wastes at Edwards have no bearing on 
current problems in Rosamond.

NEGOTIATIONS TO BEGIN ON PORTER RANCH SCHOOL SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Developers of the proposed $2-billion Porter Ranch project agreed Thursday to 
meet with representatives of the Los Angeles school district and City 
Councilman Hal Bernson to negotiate the sale of land to the district for a new 
elementary school site. 
</P>
<P>
Project representatives said Thursday that they will consider increasing the 
amount of land to be set aside for a school to serve new residents of the 
Chatsworth project. The firm has agreed to set aside five acres, which the 
district could buy if a new elementary school is needed. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been willing to set aside whatever land it takes," said Paul Clarke, 
Porter Ranch spokesman. But he added that it is too early to set aside specific 
properties for the district. 
</P>
<P>
At a school board subcommittee hearing Thursday, board member Julie Korenstein, 
who represents the area, asked representatives of the Porter Ranch Development 
Co. to consider donating or selling as much as 10 acres for a school site if 
the Los Angeles City Council approves the project. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Avoid Crowding 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein said she would like a larger-than-average site for the school to 
avoid crowding. Most elementary school sites in the San Fernando Valley are 
about six acres, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke said after the hearing that the two sides probably will seek a 
compromise during the meeting with Bernson and school district representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein, who has opposed the Porter Ranch project, tabled a motion asking 
the developer to designate 10 acres for a school site. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll wait and see," Korenstein said. "We've directed our staff to come back 
with a compromise." 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein and other board members last week criticized Nathan Shapell, owner 
of the Porter Ranch development firm, for pressuring the district in the 1970s 
to sell its surplus school properties, including a parcel next to Porter Ranch. 
As chairman of the state's Little Hoover Commission, Shapell conducted 
extensive hearings statewide on surplus school properties and urged districts, 
including Los Angeles, to sell those sites to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
Shapell's firm later bought a 37-acre parcel, originally intended as a high 
school site, next to the Porter Ranch development. So far, Shapell has built 
and sold 124 homes on the property, which he bought in 1978 for $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Now the district is faced with buying back land in the area from Shapell at 
much higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
Korenstein said the district will consider purchasing all or part of the land 
ultimately set aside by the Porter Ranch firm. Clarke said the company is 
opposed to giving any land to the district because the firm is legally required 
to donate as much as $15 million in fees to build schools. 
</P>
<P>
District officials said those fees cannot be used exclusively for building an 
elementary school in the Porter Ranch area but must be shared among other 
school projects already under way. 
</P>
<P>
Plans for the Porter Ranch development include 2,195 single-family homes, as 
well as 6 million square feet of commercial space. The project faces a key city 
hearing next month.

INVESTOR DROPS EFFORT TO BUY POKER CLUB IN GARDENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIANNE GOODMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An investor, whose application to the City of Gardena to buy the Horseshoe Club 
had run into problems with both the city and with the state attorney general's 
office, withdrew the application this week, signaling the demise of the city's 
oldest poker club. 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Stern, the former president of the Commerce Casino, asked city 
officials Tuesday to withdraw his application for a transfer of the Horseshoe 
Club's operating license issued by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Stern declined Thursday to discuss why he requested the withdrawal, but in the 
past had objected to conditions set by the city for the transfer. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed not only for myself but for a lot of the employees," Stern 
said Thursday. The club had about 75 to 100 employees when it closed for 
remodeling on May 23, down from a normal work force of about 250. 
</P>
<P>
Horseshoe General Partner Milton Corwin said the 40-year-old club would not 
reopen under the old ownership, and that the 4.4-acre site at Rosecrans and 
Vermont Avenues was up for sale as commercial real estate. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said they have received inquiries from potential buyers 
interested in the Horseshoe property, a number of whom have expressed interest 
in continuing to operate a club at the site. 
</P>
<P>
"Under proper management I think it could be successful" as a club, Mayor 
Donald Dear said. "I think it would be a choice corner for any kind of 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Corwin did not disclose the asking price for the property, but Stern and a 
partner, Los Angeles attorney Leonard Baum, had proposed buying the club, if 
the transfer of a city operating license had been approved, for about $4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Corwin said selling the property for commercial development and not as an 
operating card club diminishes the value of the property as well as the amount 
of the return on the investments of the 91 shareholders, who have owned the 
club since 1951. 
</P>
<P>
The closing of the Horseshoe has not adversely affected card club revenues to 
the city, said City Manager Kenneth Landau. In fact, card club revenues have 
increased, from $308,817 in June, 1988, to $371,493 in June, 1989, city records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and card club players said the city's remaining two clubs, the 
Eldorado Club and the Normandie Casino, have taken up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
Lester Mindus, a Gardena psychologist who played at the Horseshoe nearly every 
day for eight years, said he had joined other former Horseshoe customers who 
now play across Rosecrans Avenue at the Normandie Casino. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Clubs Left 
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty happy where I am, but it's not the same," Mindus said. 
</P>
<P>
The Normandie's bustling atmosphere is far different, he said, from the 
relative emptiness at the Horseshoe during the months before it closed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's sad there are only two clubs where there were once six," Mindus said. 
</P>
<P>
Together in their heyday, Gardena's six poker clubs provided about a third of 
the city's revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The Horseshoe was once the most profitable of the casinos, said Tom Parks, 
formerly a 25-year Horseshoe employee who is executive vice president of the 
Gardena Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
"At one time we were the top club in town," Parks said. When Proposition 13 
passed in 1978, however, other cities "were strapped for funds and started 
looking at (clubs) as a potential revenue raiser." 
</P>
<P>
Gardena's card clubs, after having a monopoly on the market in Los Angeles 
County since 1938, began lagging behind newly opened clubs, which offered bars, 
a greater variety of games and higher limits. 
</P>
<P>
"Gardena (clubs) eventually did those things, but they were always following 
behind what the other clubs were doing," Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Mas Fukai, the council's most vocal critic of the Stern-Baum 
buyout proposal, said he was sorry to see the club closed. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't blame anybody except the present management of the Horseshoe Club," 
Fukai said. "They let it run down." 
</P>
<P>
Fukai said the city had been justified in setting stringent financial 
conditions for the transfer of the license because the city was protecting its 
reputation for closely monitoring its poker clubs. 
</P>
<P>
The plan by Stern and Baum to buy the club encountered problems soon after it 
was proposed in March. 
</P>
<P>
In May, the council tabled the application after Stern and Baum balked at 
meeting five city demands for the license transfer, including obtaining a $6 
million letter of credit and setting up a $180,000 escrow account to cover 
employees' pay for four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Background Investigation 
</P>
<P>
The council tabled the proposal again in June after an investigation of Stern's 
background by the city's Police Department revealed discrepancies with Stern's 
written application. 
</P>
<P>
Stern said on the application that he had never been a party to a lawsuit, but 
the city found that he had been involved in at least two lawsuits. One, filed 
in 1984, alleged financial misconduct against the management of the Commerce 
Club. He was the president. The suit was later settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
Baum, who is also Stern's attorney, told the council that the omission of the 
lawsuit from the application was an oversight. 
</P>
<P>
Also in June, the state attorney general's office informed city and club 
officials that the gaming registration certificates of the club's shareholders 
was to expire July 1 and could not be renewed because the club was closed. 
</P>
<P>
Baum told the city council that club officials planned to renew all 91 
certificates, but Corwin said Thursday that the shareholders have since been 
informed that that plan has been scrapped.

RENOVATIONS TO EASE SQUEEZE AT SAN FERNANDO COURTHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An end to crowding is in sight for the San Fernando Courthouse's arraignment 
court, which recently was cited as a fire hazard because too many people were 
crammed into the small room. 
</P>
<P>
A courtroom renovation and expansion project underway at the old courthouse 
will create two new municipal courts with their own courtrooms. One of the new 
courtrooms will be used to handle traffic arraignments now processed in the 
overtaxed Division 130, which some lawyers and judges call the busiest 
courtroom in the county. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to alleviate the serious overcrowding and adjudicate matters in a 
timely fashion," said Eileen Berger, a spokeswoman for Los Angeles County 
Municipal Courts. "We will relieve Division 130, and make that building as 
efficient as it can be." 
</P>
<P>
Division 130 handles about 250 cases a day, a 40% increase over last year. 
Defendants in all cases at the San Fernando Courthouse -- from minor traffic 
violations to murders -- are arraigned there. 
</P>
<P>
Although Commissioner Gerald Richardson, who presides over Division 130, 
arraigns people at a rate of about one per minute, people frequently wait all 
day to pay a traffic ticket. 
</P>
<P>
The congestion prompted Los Angeles Fire Department inspectors to cite San 
Fernando Municipal Court officials last month for two fire-code violations -- 
crowding and blocking exit aisles -- in the arraignment court. The court was 
not fined, however, because officials quickly sent people out of the courtroom 
to wait in the hall until their cases were called. 
</P>
<P>
The courtroom has a legal capacity of 119. As many as 190 are sometimes ordered 
to show up at 9 a.m. for arraignment, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The new courtrooms will be located in space previously occupied by lawyers' 
offices and a branch of the Los Angeles County Library. The lawyers relocated 
and the library moved to a new building in September, 1988, vacating 3,000 
square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Richardson said that moving traffic cases to another courtroom will alleviate 
much of the pressure on the staff of Division 130. More than 14,000 traffic 
violators were arraigned in Division 130 between July, 1988, and May, 1989, 
according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
Berger said court officials are still deciding how they will use the second new 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, one court may receive one of the four new judges the county has 
been authorized by the state to hire. But, initially, both will be staffed by 
lawyers who volunteer to serve as temporary judges, Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
The remodeling is one part of a general face lift for the old San Fernando 
Courthouse building, located in the 900 block of First Street directly behind 
the new courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
The expansion raises the number of courtrooms in the bungalow-style building 
from four to six. The building, built in 1953, was the only court facility in 
San Fernando until the completion of the new building in 1983, Berger said. 
Three of the original courtrooms are used for misdemeanor trial courts, and the 
other for small claims and traffic trials. 
</P>
<P>
The renovation project includes improving security and handicapped access, 
painting and carpeting, Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
Work began at the end of April and is expected to be completed by the end of 
August at a cost of $50,000, taken from general construction funds, Berger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
During remodeling, trials have continued in three of the courtrooms. Matters 
scheduled for the fourth have been sent to a makeshift courtroom in a 
conference room at the Van Nuys Courthouse, Berger said.

PALMDALE BACKS CHILD ABUSE FACILITY; 
</P>
<P>
CITY COUNCIL VOTES $10,000 TO HELP SET UP ANTELOPE VALLEY CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Palmdale City Council on Thursday agreed to donate $10,000 in city funds to 
a community group working to establish a center for the treatment and 
prevention of child abuse in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Although they had requested $50,000, board members of the proposed Antelope 
Valley Child Abuse Center praised the council decision. 
</P>
<P>
"The City Council has showed it is enlightened on this subject," said Gene 
House, a Palm Springs consultant who is heading fund-raising efforts for the 
center. "We are very grateful that the council has recognized the city's 
responsibility to provide a municipal solution to this crisis." 
</P>
<P>
While council members spoke favorably of the project, they noted that the city 
of Palmdale has already donated staff time and other resources to help the 
center raise about $25,000 in private donations. 
</P>
<P>
At the suggestion of Councilman Dan Becker, they approved the contribution of a 
reduced amount of $10,000 to help establish the center, with the possibility of 
a $7,500 contribution next year depending on the center's fund-raising success. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we recognize that there's a problem and something should be done about 
it," Mayor Pete Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
House said he hopes the decision will push the city of Lancaster and Los 
Angeles County to reconsider the center's requests for money. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed child abuse center has generated widespread interest and financial 
support in the Antelope Valley, with private contributors donating about 
$200,000 of the $300,000 needed for the center to open this fall. 
</P>
<P>
But the issue also has generated some discord, with some community leaders 
saying proponents of the center have been overzealous in seeking money from 
local governments. 
</P>
<P>
The center's board of directors -- a group of doctors, executives and other 
community leaders -- had asked the cities of Palmdale and Lancaster to commit 
an annual $50,000 each to the center, and asked for $100,000 from Los Angeles 
County. The facility would provide comprehensive treatment for child abuse 
victims and their families, and education programs for residents and law 
enforcement and social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
County officials and Lancaster city officials have said they do not have the 
money the center requested. Knight, a member of the proposed center's board, 
had been among local officials who said granting the request would be unfair to 
other social causes. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday, representatives of the Antelope Valley Child Abuse Center told 
council members their cause merits special help because the child abuse problem 
is greater in the Antelope Valley than elsewhere and is the root of other 
social ills. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have a social crisis that has been demonstrated to cause a whole host 
of expensive, misery-causing problems, perhaps you have a right and obligation 
to give it priority," House told the council. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the county Department of Childrens Services, law enforcement 
agencies and schools show that the Antelope Valley has a higher proportionate 
rate of reported child abuse cases than more densely populated urban areas such 
as Long Beach and a county service area encompassing Inglewood, Santa Monica 
and the western San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say the isolation of the high desert, its attraction to antisocial 
"loners," and the pressures of long commutes to Los Angeles on working parents, 
along with a stronger propensity for neighbors in "small town" areas to report 
abuse, account for the high incidence of the problem.

WEEKENDER: PENINSULA BUTTERFLY COUNT 'LETS ADULTS BE KIDS AGAIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The butterfly, no larger than a fingernail, was easy to overlook as it flitted 
over a low clump of weeds along the path in Rancho Palos Verdes' Barkentine 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
But naturalist Jess Morton not only saw the tiny flier, he knew what it was 
even before he skillfully snared it with a flick of his butterfly net. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pygmy blue, the smallest of all the North American butterflies," said 
Morton, who is president of the Palos Verdes Peninsula Audubon Society. 
</P>
<P>
He carefully removed the tiny insect from the folds of the net so that his 
hiking companions could look at its delicate bluish-gold wings. 
</P>
<P>
Morton fielded a flurry of questions: How long does it live, and what does it 
eat? The answers: It lives only a few days, and it feeds on small flowering 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Morton and other butterfly experts will be answering many more 
questions about a lot more butterflies as the conservation group conducts its 
annual South Bay butterfly count. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to spot and record as many different butterfly species as possible 
in parks, wetlands, hillsides and canyons. None are captured. Everyone -- 
whether knowledgeable about butterflies or not -- is welcome. 
</P>
<P>
Walton Wright, the Torrance city naturalist who has been a group leader since 
the count started nine years ago, said volunteers tend to be novices who don't 
know one butterfly from another when the day begins. 
</P>
<P>
"It lets adults be kids again," he said. "When you're an adult, people don't 
expect you to walk around with a butterfly net in your hand and run over 
fields. This gives you a reason to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Shirley Borks, an Audubon Society member who has been on several counts: 
"You struggle around in the wilderness and have a fun time as well. When you 
finally do identify a butterfly, you're excited." 
</P>
<P>
Participants Saturday will meet at Rolling Hills Estates City Hall, where they 
will be divided into groups to tramp through such areas as South Coast Botanic 
Garden on Crenshaw Boulevard, Malaga Cove and Bluff Cove in Palos Verdes 
Estates, rustic canyons in Rolling Hills and Rancho Palos Verdes, Madrona Marsh 
in Torrance and Harbor Regional Park in Harbor City. 
</P>
<P>
Not everybody sticks it out all day, but for those who do, there will be a 
picnic and count tally at 5:30 p.m. at Hesse Park, 29301 Hawthorne Blvd., 
Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
While there is a scientific purpose to the event -- the count becomes part of a 
nationwide study of the abundance and diversity of butterflies by the 
conservationist Xerces Society -- Morton and others say the main purpose is to 
educate people about the natural world around them. 
</P>
<P>
"We point out what you would see in front of you if you knew what it was all 
along," said Morton, who operates a tax service and became an avocational 
naturalist in the 1970s out of curiosity about the San Pedro canyon he lived 
in. "An expert is only someone with a developed eye." 
</P>
<P>
Wright said spotting a particular butterfly opens up an entire environment: 
"When you look at them, you also look at what food plants the animals live on, 
and the particular plant the adults lay their eggs on. As you look at 
butterflies, you note their activity. Essentially, we talk about the ecology of 
butterflies." 
</P>
<P>
According to Morton, the peninsula in particular is a rich area for butterflies 
because of its open, undeveloped areas. Last year, 30 different species were 
spotted there -- ranging from several categories of the tiny blues to the 
spectacular gulf fritillary, which is orange with silver spots. 
</P>
<P>
People who go on the count should wear hiking shoes and hats for sun 
protection, and bring water and a snack. The groups caravan by car from one 
location to another, so there are opportunities to stop for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Morton is expecting clear weather Saturday, but the peninsula overcast has 
played havoc with past counts. Said Borks: "One year it was foggy, and 
butterflies don't come out unless it's sunny." 
</P>
<P>
But Morton said that even when butterflies are scarce, the count provides a 
good day in the outdoors: "There are bees, birds and plants, always something 
going on."

MAN WHO ROBBED FOR DRUG MONEY GETS 7-YEAR TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite his emotional pleas for mercy, a Reseda man who was charged with 
robbing seven San Fernando Valley convenience stores to support his drug habit 
was sentenced Thursday to seven years in state prison by a San Fernando 
Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
According to court documents, Gabor Frank Magyari, 30, stole more than $1,600 
from seven small convenience stores between October, 1988, and this January. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with prosecutors, he pleaded guilty to five counts of 
robbery. Two other counts were dismissed, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
Judge John A. Major rejected pleas by Magyari, his mother and stepfather and 
his lawyer, who asked "in the name of mercy" that Major "punish the sin and not 
the sinner" by placing Magyari in a long-term drug rehabilitation program 
instead of prison. 
</P>
<P>
Magyari told the judge he began smoking marijuana at age 13 and was hooked on 
drugs by 20. Choking on tears, Magyari said he now wants to get a fresh start 
on life by kicking the habit. 
</P>
<P>
But Major said Magyari had exercised his "free will" in using drugs and robbing 
stores. "You have to be punished. You have to learn that you cannot go through 
life sticking a gun in someone's face, robbing them of their hard-earned 
money," Major said. 
</P>
<P>
Magyari probably will be paroled in about three years, Major said.

INGLEWOOD AWARD IS WELL-DESERVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As a longtime resident of Inglewood, I too am proud of the All-America City 
Award, despite its critics (Times, July 7). Yes, it is unfortunate that 
apparently this award was mainly given on the crime prevention programs 
established by the city. The prevention of crime is foremost on people's minds 
everywhere and Inglewood is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
Let me assure you, however, that there are many other worthwhile programs and 
activities in this city to qualify us as All-American: Inglewood Women's 
Beautification Assn., which, in cooperation with block clubs and individuals, 
is planting and maintaining flower beds three times a year all throughout the 
city; the annual Community Recognition Dinner; the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
festivities and the Memorial Day service; Fourth of July "Picnic in the Park"; 
Inglewood Playhouse; Sister City program; the excellent recreation facilities 
in all the parks; Inglewood Neighborhood Housing Service, a nonprofit 
organization dedicated to improving the housing and living conditions in their 
neighborhood, just to name a few. Citizens are participating on many levels and 
aspects of city life and determined to make a difference. Last but not least, 
as also noted in your paper, the interracial harmony we all enjoy. Inglewood is 
truly a dynamic and vibrant place to live. Let no one tell you otherwise! 
</P>
<P>
It is too bad that there are always critics gnawing and biting at the heels of 
success. Nevertheless, these folks are also a part of the whole experience that 
makes an All-America City.

DROPOUT RATE STUNS AZUSA SCHOOLS; 
</P>
<P>
DISTRICT ATTACKS STATE FIGURES, ASKS FOR RE-EVALUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE CHANG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stunned by a state report showing that more than half of the area's high school 
students drop out before graduation, officials of the Azusa Unified School 
District are asking that the district be re-evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, released last month by the Department of Education, 
the district has a 51.8% dropout rate, the second highest among California 
public high schools. It is topped only by Reef-Sunset Unified School District 
in Kings County, at 60.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Education Department officials said they are looking at data from Azusa, one of 
about 30 districts statewide that asked for re-evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
Azusa Supt. Duane Stiff said he believes the rate is closer to 32%. But no 
matter which figure is used, he said, Azusa's dropout rate is high. He 
attributed it to these factors: 
</P>
<P>
Funding. Azusa gets $2,700 per student each year, less than the state average. 
"We don't have the $4,500 per student that Beverly Hills has," Stiff said. 
</P>
<P>
Parents' limited education. According to California Assessment Program (CAP) 
figures, only 4% of parents with children in the district have advanced 
degrees, and 20% did not finish high school. One manifestation of this is the 
emphasis placed on eighth-grade graduation ceremonies. "That means that it's an 
objective, a major goal," he said. "If asked if they want their kids to 
graduate from high school, they'd probably say yes. But they know there's a 
good possibility they won't." 
</P>
<P>
CAP test scores for Azusa also indicate poor academic performance in the high 
schools. In the 1987-88 school year, seniors in the district's two high schools 
scored in the 15th percentile in reading and in the 18th percentile in 
mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Stiff cited Azusa's large migrant population as evidence that the 
report is flawed. Sixty-five percent of the students are Latino, many of them 
children of migrant laborers. Many migrant children, Stiff said, are out of 
school for a few months each agricultural season. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not uncommon for classrooms to completely turn over in one year," he 
said. "One time there was a 130% turnover." 
</P>
<P>
Although each district is responsible for keeping track of students from 
migrant families, some students return with their families to Mexico and do not 
report their whereabouts. Therefore they are counted as dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
Susie Lange, an Education Department spokeswoman, acknowledged that the 
reporting system "is not foolproof" for students from mobile families. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Measure 
</P>
<P>
The state report was the first to measure actual dropout rates, rather than 
attrition, which includes those students who move out of the area or enroll in 
an alternative education program. 
</P>
<P>
The dropout rate was obtained by counting the number of dropouts in 10th grade 
from 1985-86, from 11th grade in 1986-87 and from 12th grade in 1987-88, and 
dividing that total by the number of 10th-graders enrolled in 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
A dropout is defined as someone who is absent from school for more than 45 days 
and who does not enroll in continuation school or have his transcript sent to 
another district. 
</P>
<P>
Using that criterion, the study calculated a statewide dropout rate of 22.7%, 
and a 29.1% rate among Los Angeles County high schools. 
</P>
<P>
Among San Gabriel Valley schools, San Marino Unified School District had the 
lowest rate, at 1.3%. El Monte was the second highest, at 30.2%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Socioeconomic Status Cited 
</P>
<P>
Officials in several valley high school districts, including El Monte, Pomona 
(with a 27.1% dropout rate) and Bassett (24.4%), said they believed that the 
state report overestimated the rates by about 5%. 
</P>
<P>
In San Marino and Walnut Valley Unified, where the state reported a 5.9% 
dropout rate, school officials said the communities' high socioeconomic status 
was the No. 1 reason they are able to keep students in school. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, Azusa school officials have begun a number of programs to combat 
the dropout problem. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, with money from a state dropout prevention plan, the district hired a 
staff member to visit the homes of students with attendance problems and stress 
the importance of education to the family. 
</P>
<P>
The district also established an Alternative Education Center in Glendora, 
which provides classes year-round for working students, teen-age mothers and 
bilingual students. Students can determine their own schedules and work toward 
a high school diploma or take a high school equivalency test. 
</P>
<P>
Most recently, the district identified 40 high-risk ninth-graders who had been 
performing under grade level. The students were given individual instruction 
for part of the day, and 93% finished the school year. 
</P>
<P>
"These are students who we predicted would all be gone by November," said Nancy 
Moore, a school administrator. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Surprise to Student 
</P>
<P>
Although disputed by the authorities, Azusa's 51% dropout rate didn't surprise 
one student attending the Alternative Education Center Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I can see it's true," said Jason Rodarte, 17, who dropped out three times 
before enrolling in continuation school. "I have a lot of friends who dropped 
out, most because they're members of gangs. It's what they're supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
Rodarte recalled attending a class that started with 30 students and shrunk to 
only eight at the end of the year. Rodarte, though, says he is "paying for what 
I've done." 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to get my life straight because I screwed up. Now I have a list of 
stuff I can learn. I probably want to fix jet engines and learn how to fly."

FROM THE AMBIVALENT TO THE AMBITIOUS, YOUTHS TAKE TO THE LAKE FOR RACES AT THE 
WESTLAKE YACHT CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chip Werner, a 9-year-old former landlubber with a week of sailing lessons 
behind him, was about to take part in the first regatta of his life last Sunday 
afternoon. If he was nervous, it didn't show when he casually approached no 
less an authority figure than the rear commodore of the Westlake Yacht Club and 
inquired, "After the race, then are we allowed to just sail around?" 
</P>
<P>
To Werner, the elaborate ritual of racing regattas was standing in the way of 
further fun on the lake. There were those colored flags that he was supposed to 
decipher. And lots of blasts from an air horn that signaled something. And 
markers on the water that had to be followed. All he wanted to do was jump into 
his 8-foot sabot and run with the wind. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I really like," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Westlake Yacht Club is also hoping that once Chip begins to understand the 
rituals, he'll like racing enough to make it a lifelong sport, perhaps even 
reaching the heights achieved by one of its former junior members, Allison 
Jolly. Jolly, along with crew Lynne Jewell, won a sailing gold medal in last 
year's Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
Chip was the youngest sailor -- the oldest among the 14 competitors was 15 -- 
in Sunday's Bill Vrooman Memorial Regatta, which got the same treatment from 
club members as the big regattas that draw some of the best sailors in the 
country to the 150-acre man-made lake. Chip would be racing in the B class 
against sailors who had more experience but still had never won a regatta. Once 
a sailor wins in B, he must move up to the A class. 
</P>
<P>
Standing on the dock in front of the club, Chip felt a sudden breeze ripple 
across the water, starching the sail on the sabot. Almost every day at this 
time, the ocean wind funnels down the Conejo grade and turns Westlake into a 
sailor's paradise. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Hine, the rear commodore who runs the regattas, also noticed the wind 
making its daily appearance. He was talking to Chip's parents when he saw a 
young sailor on the lake take advantage of a gust. Sailing a nimble C-13, the 
boy extended his body over the port side in a maneuver known as "hiking out," 
and the boat sped across the lake, its sail nearly touching the water on the 
starboard side. 
</P>
<P>
Hine pointed to the boy and said, "That'll be Chip in a couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
The air horn sounded and Chip looked up at the observation tower where a white 
flag was being hoisted. An A-class heat would start in precisely 10 minutes, 
the Bs five minutes after that. All the young sailors started to prepare their 
boats, mindful of the red-and-yellow flag on the tower that told them to wear 
their life jackets. 
</P>
<P>
Each class would race on specially marked courses that wouldn't be made known 
until the race committee announced it by hanging a number from the tower. The 
sailors would have to read a chart of the lake in their boat and figure out the 
right course, which wasn't easy for inexperienced navigators. The circular 
course took the sailors to an island about a quarter-mile away and back to a 
dam before winding up at the finish line in front of the club. 
</P>
<P>
Sailing races, even within the intimate confines of a lake, don't generate the 
same kind of hysteria as, say, a football game. Mostly, parents and other 
observers sat under green umbrellas on the deck during the races and enjoyed 
the scenery, occasionally scanning the lake for signs of junior's progress. 
</P>
<P>
Hine was kept busier than all but the sailors while the races went on. As rear 
commodore, his white flag flies third from left on the mast that rises above 
the deck. It's his responsibility to deal with problems. When another club 
member noticed a sailboat tied to a marker in the middle of the race course, 
Hine started the 6-volt battery in his trusty 15-foot Electra, the Rot 'n Don, 
and went to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
The Electra rolled over the water at about 3 to 4 knots and Hine, a retired 
banker who lives on the lake, popped a Beach Boys tape into his stereo system. 
"Never a wake and no noise," he said about his boat, which was custom-built for 
him and his wife Dot. "You don't have to have a 50-foot yacht to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
Hine steered to the sailboat and saw two teen-age girls sunbathing inside. 
"These marks are private," he told them in a friendly way. "We have a race 
going on and would appreciate it if you would cast off." The girls obliged and 
Hine headed back to the dock. Passing a sabot, he saw two small girls having 
trouble making headway. 
</P>
<P>
"Let the sail out," Hine instructed them, "then pull the rudder back to you." 
When the boat was under control, he said, "Now you're sailing!" 
</P>
<P>
Hine relaxed under the Electra's canopy and set a course to the island to check 
the progress of the race. Despite the wind, the tiny sailboats were tacking 
slowly across the lake and Hine was able to putter up next to the leaders in 
the A class, Ryan Coyle, 14, and Brian Foster, 12. Each sailor was trimming his 
sails like an old salt. At the end of the race, Coyle and Foster were bow and 
bow until Foster's sabot edged ahead to win by a half-boat length. 
</P>
<P>
"Ryan is a real comer," Hine said, "and Brian is a natural. He can feel a 
change of wind on his cheek." 
</P>
<P>
Foster's communion with the wind is no accident. When he was 2, "I got 
interested watching flags blow in the wind," he said. At 4, he was building his 
own kites. Four years ago, his mother, whose parents live at the lake, gave him 
sailing lessons at the club. "He kind of goes with the wind," said Karen Foster 
Caruso, who lives in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
While Brian went off to practice rigging a C-13 and wait for the next heat, the 
B class finished its race, and Chip Werner was first across the finish line. 
Happy to see him do well was his stepfather, Frank Marshall of Agoura, a 
lifelong sailor who would "rather have Chip out here sailing than hanging 
around video arcades." 
</P>
<P>
But Chip's win didn't count. In the tower, race committee chairman Don Anderson 
disqualified the B class for sailing on the wrong side of a marker. The 
youngsters could protest, "But we have a saying at the club: The protest 
committee meets at midnight and you have to be present," said Anderson, who was 
wearing a T-shirt that read: "Sailing -- the fine art of getting soaked and 
becoming sick whilst slowly going nowhere at great expense." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson excused himself and got ready for the next heat. When Lois 
Littlefield, who was in charge of the official clock, counted down to zero and 
blasted the air horn, Anderson hoisted the white flag. But neither Chip Werner 
nor Brian Foster fared well. When the regatta finally ended, Coyle won the A 
class and Eric Steelberg took the B. Afterward, the young sailors snacked on 
cake in the clubhouse, and Chip was finally able to get out on the lake by 
himself.

TAGLIAFERRI, WHITE AGAIN FAIL TO SCORE 700 ON SAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Russell White and Gino Tagliaferri, perhaps the Valley-area's most prominent 
high school athletes during the past school year, shared less auspicious ground 
recently as both again failed to meet the minimum score of 700 on the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test mandated by Proposition 48 of the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Cal, which signed White to a letter of intent in February, announced Thursday 
that the tailback will forfeit his freshman year of athletic eligibility 
because he failed to score 700. White, who attended Crespi High, was one of the 
nation's most recruited players. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliaferri, who led Kennedy High to the City Section 4-A Division baseball 
title last month, received similar news last week and will sit out his freshman 
year at Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
Under the guidelines of Prop. 48, which took effect in 1986, high school 
student-athletes must maintain a 2.0 grade-point average in core-curriculum 
classes and an SAT score of 700 or better to ensure eligibility as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
White, who could not be reached for comment Thursday, and Tagliaferri met the 
core-curriculum requirements but failed to meet the SAT standards. 
</P>
<P>
White, who set state career records for rushing (5,998 yards), touchdowns (94) 
and scoring (568 points), took the SAT at least three times. Tagliaferri also 
took the test on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed that I will not be able to play this season, but I came here 
to Cal to get a good education and this gives me a chance to focus on my 
academics the first year," White said in a prepared statement released by Cal. 
"I'm going to be like any other freshman getting adjusted to college. Next 
year, I'll put the uniform back on and resume my football career." 
</P>
<P>
Although White, who is attending summer school at Cal, is eligible to play 
football at a junior college next season, he said earlier this year that he 
would not pursue that option if he failed to meet Prop. 48 requirements on the 
SAT. 
</P>
<P>
White and Tagliaferri could also retain their four years of eligibility by 
paying their own expenses for the first year at Cal and Fresno State, but it is 
doubtful that either of them will do so. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed for Russell," said Bill Redell, who coached White during his 
three varsity years at Crespi. "I personally think that the whole SAT testing 
thing for athletes needs to be addressed. He took more core subjects than (NCAA 
guidelines) require and his GPA was 2.3, when they only require a 2.0. Russell 
did fairly well academically." 
</P>
<P>
White led Crespi to a 28-8-1 record during his career at the private all-boys 
school in Encino. White was named the state player of the year after leading 
Crespi to the Southern Section Big Five Conference title in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
He also performed brilliantly in track and field, winning six Southern Section 
2-A Division titles during his career, including the 100 and 200 meters, long 
jump and triple jump this season. 
</P>
<P>
White placed third in the triple jump, eighth in the 200 and ninth in the long 
jump in the state championships in June and was eighth in the 200 (88) and 
second in the triple jump (87) the previous two years. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliaferri, who last season led California players in home runs with 13, was 
named the City Section 4-A and Times Valley Player of the Year and set a City 
career home run mark of 23. 
</P>
<P>
Tagliaferri said that he is still in contact with the Detroit Tigers, who 
selected him in the third round of the amateur draft last month, but does not 
expect to sign. He said Detroit's most recent offer was for $55,000, a bonus 
that is at least $15,000 less than Tagliaferri would like. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm registered for 17 units, I have a place to live and I'm ready to go," he 
said. "(Detroit) keeps saying that I won't survive in an academic atmosphere. 
But I've always done the minimum to get by in school. If I try, I know I can 
make it." 
</P>
<P>
Fresno State Coach Bill Bennett said last month that the school would welcome 
Tagliaferri even if he did not satisfy Prop. 48 requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"It's embarrassing," Tagliaferri said. "But they told me that this way, maybe 
it would help me adapt to college better."

POWER SKATING EXPERT SHARPENS HOCKEY PLAYERS' GAME; 
</P>
<P>
LOCAL CLINICS OFFER COACHING THAT IMPROVED SKILLS IN NHL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Two little boys wearing two very large helmets put their sticks on the ice and 
pretended to face off like the pros. 
</P>
<P>
An older skater came between them and pointed to the instructor: "Pay 
attention," he whispered, and the boys obediently listened. 
</P>
<P>
Not far from the trio, Laura Stamm patiently explained the importance of the 
penguin walk, a drill that helps players remember how to grip the ice with 
their blade. 
</P>
<P>
Stamm, a hockey power skating expert, has been an instructor since 1971, and so 
she knows that hockey players frequently resist learning the fundamental 
skating techniques that will improve their game. 
</P>
<P>
"Power skating is not the fun part of hockey. But it's what makes hockey fun to 
play," Stamm said. "Most guys don't learn any technique. They just go out and 
play. But just how correcting a little hitch in your golf swing can change your 
game, a little hitch in your skating mechanics can change your game too." 
</P>
<P>
When Stamm, a New Yorker, talks people would be well advised to listen. 
</P>
<P>
She is credited with improving the skating skills of more than 100 National 
Hockey League players and writing three books on the subject. She is not only 
an experienced power skating coach, but a well-versed one as well. 
</P>
<P>
According to Stamm, power skating can be defined as the ability to skate from 
one point to another as quickly as possible and remain balanced once you get 
there. To achieve this, Stamm has divided skating into four segments: windup, 
release, follow-through and return. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Laura is terrific," said 43-year-old Jim Brust, who attended 
Thursday's novice clinic in Culver City. "She's the only skating instructor 
I've ever had who breaks everything down and tells you exactly what to do." 
</P>
<P>
The clinic moves to the South Bay's Olympic Ice Arena (Harbor City) for three 
sessions beginning tonight at 8 and will continue Saturday from 1:45 to 3:30 
p.m. and Sunday from 9 to 10:30 a.m. It is open to novice and advanced skaters 
of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Johnson, the only woman in the Culver City session, wiped her face with 
a towel as she tried to catch her breath after Thursday's session. "I was 
looking forward to it for a long time, because I'm always trying to keep up 
with guys. The best part of it was that she explains herself in a few words. 
Then when you're skating, you can think about what she told you." 
</P>
<P>
Stamm, who recently published her third book, "Laura Stamm's Power Skating," 
works with novice and advanced skaters in addition to NHL teams. After several 
years of instructing members of the New York Rangers and Islanders, Stamm now 
works with the New Jersey Devils and the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
Stamm admits that coaching professional players was difficult in the beginning. 
"I was terrified. I remember saying to myself, 'What am I going to teach these 
guys?' I think it may have been a little embarrassing for the guys. They may 
not have liked their coach sending them to a woman. But then their skating 
improved and players like (former New York Islander) Bob Nystrom would would 
rave about power skating." 
</P>
<P>
Publicity on Stamm and power skating eventually reached Bay Harbor Red Devils 
Coach John Mephan, and a few months ago when he learned that Stamm was holding 
a clinic in Culver City he contacted her to set up a clinic in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"You can be the best stick handler and shooter in the world, but if you can't 
skate well to get into the play, it doesn't do you any good," Mephan said. 
"Skills must be built on the solid foundation of power skating. If we are able 
to bring in people like Laura Stamm, eventually California will produce 
Olympic-caliber players. Why should all the hockey players come from the Great 
Lakes or the Northeast?" 
</P>
<P>
This is the second year Stamm has taught clinics in Southern California, and 
she says she's impressed by the enthusiasm of local youth hockey organizers 
like Mephan. 
</P>
<P>
"They're paying me to work with the kids, but they're not doing this to make 
money from it," Stamm said. "These clinics are really a service to the players 
so they get better and have a greater commitment to the sport." 
</P>
<P>
While improving the quality of youth hockey in California relies on a 
commitment from the players, a commitment from parents is also integral. In 
addition to providing expensive equipment, parents often find themselves 
traveling long distances at odd hours since ice time is so valuable in an area 
with few skating rinks. 
</P>
<P>
"Parents really have to be willing to do a lot," said Marianne Stone as her son 
Tom suited up for the session. "I really didn't know what I was getting myself 
into. But I do love it because hockey's such an exciting sport." 
</P>
<P>
Eight-year-old Tom Stone is a hockey veteran of sorts since he began skating 
three years ago during the pre-Gretzky era in Los Angeles. But Stamm and Mephan 
agree that interest in the sport has risen tremendously since hockey's 
superstar was traded from the Edmonton Oilers to the Kings last August. 
</P>
<P>
"It's made a tremendous impact here," Stamm said. "Every coach I've spoken to 
tells me their numbers are up in the adult community as well as with the kids. 
People here do everything. They're participants and hockey is a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps this is why the little ones fidget when they watch Stamm execute 
skating drills rather than breakaways. Perhaps they remember what their 
instructor said to them only moments before they took the ice: 
</P>
<P>
"When you give a kid a stick, skates and ice to skate on, it's magic. You're 
hooked for life. The feeling of moving on ice is a feeling of not being bound 
to the Earth. It's a feeling of freedom."

Joe Sturges, a catcher from Thousand Oaks High who played baseball and football 
the past two years at Southern Utah State, signed a letter of intent this week 
to attend The Master's College. 
</P>
<P>
Sturges, who will enter Master's as a junior, batted .315 with 4 home runs and

ITALIAN HOSTS GIVE HARVARD WATER POLO LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM BROWN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the Harvard Water Polo Foundation returned Wednesday morning from a 
two-week tour of Italy with more than suitcases full of dirty laundry to show 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
The defending Southern Section 2-A Division champions came back toting the 
experience of international water polo at the European club level. Although 
Harvard won just two of its 18 matches and tied another, Harvard Coach Rich 
Corso was pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't take a team to conquer Europe," Corso said. "We went to learn water 
polo. Now they know what good water polo is. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good to see great water polo in Europe instead of the kids hearing me 
talk about it or showing it to them in videos." 
</P>
<P>
Brian Border, a sophomore on the Saracens' championship team last season, was 
among the 15 players who toured Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"We learned a lot from the Italians," Border said. "Just learning their style 
of play. Things we can bring back to the United States and put into our game." 
</P>
<P>
Harvard, after going to the 2-A Division final the past two years, has joined 
the Del Rey League, a member of the 3-A Division. With the upgrade in divisions 
comes a new challenge for Corso, who will begin his fourth season at Harvard in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
The Italian tour, he said, will aid in that transition. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the kids that we were the students when we went over there," Corso 
said. "We were going to learn the game. The club teams in Italy were very 
complimentary on how young we were and how we came back to the pool with new 
energy every day. So far, it's been an excellent summer of training." 
</P>
<P>
A Bergamo, Italy, club, which served at Harvard's host, likely will tour the 
Valley next summer.

FISHING / DAN STANTON: ANGLERS ENJOYING BEST BARRACUDA RUN IN OVER A DECADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dan Stanton 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Barracuda fishing is setting the pace this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen are enjoying one of the best runs since 1977 when a 28-inch limit 
went into effect. 
</P>
<P>
According to marine supervisor Don Schultze of the Department of Fish and Game, 
if the size limit had not been established, this year's big run may never have 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
"The catches now being made are similar to those recorded in the 1950s and '60s 
and may go higher," Schultze said. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1971 there was no size limit, Schultze said. Marine biologists pushed 
for limits because they were concerned about future barracuda stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Barracuda is a migratory fish that puts up a good fight when hooked. It is one 
of the most sought after spring and summer game fish. 
</P>
<P>
The bite continues in a wide area. South Bay anglers have been catching the 
daily 10-fish limit on day and twilight trips to Rocky Point, the Horseshoe 
Kelp Beds and at Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, July is albacore-watch month. The tasty white-meat tuna could 
arrive at any time and rumors often fly as to their whereabouts. But no big 
sightings have been made yet and private boat and landing owners are getting 
nervous. 
</P>
<P>
The Redondo Sportfishing half-day boat City of Redondo returns to the landing 
Saturday after a year-and-a-half of refurbishing. The boat was heavily damaged 
by the storms that wracked King Harbor and destroyed part of the breakwater in 
January, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The American Bass Assn. is sponsoring its first On-The-Wall Saltwater 
Tournament at Cabrillo Beach on Saturday night. Check-in time for skiffs is 4 
p.m. at the Cabrillo launch area. Fishing begins at 6. Weigh-ins will be at 1 
a.m. Sunday. Two fishermen are allowed per skiff and $500 in prizes will be 
awarded. For more information call Dave at 376-1026. 
</P>
<P>
CATCHES OF THE WEEK: 
</P>
<P>
William Miller of Gardena, fishing aboard the Hitless Miss at the Rigs, caught 
the Whopper of the Week when he hooked a 31 1/4-pound yellowtail using sardine 
as bait. 
</P>
<P>
Al Contreas of Santa Monica, fishing aboard the Happyman in the bay, caught a 
25-pound halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Dubuys of Torrance, aboard the Sea Spray at Twin Roads, hooked a 23-pound 
halibut. 
</P>
<P>
Wilber Johannes of Long Beach caught 21-pound white sea bass at Catalina Island 
on the El Dorado. 
</P>
<P>
FISHING REPORT: 
</P>
<P>
Surface action for sand bass and barracuda remains steady. Catalina white sea 
bass action has slowed, with calico bass and barracuda making up most of the 
catches. 
</P>
<P>
At Marina del Rey Sportfishing, the Happyman on two half-day trips brought in 
225 sand bass, 75 barracuda, nine bonito and one halibut. The Spitfire fished 
the bay and anglers hooked 260 sand bass, 80 bonito and a halibut. The Betty O 
rock cod special totaled 225. 
</P>
<P>
At Redondo Sportfishing the Sea Spray went to Rocky Point and sacked 440 sand 
bass, 18 bonito, three barracuda and two halibut. The Redondo Special on a 
half-day trip to Twin Roads hooked 70 sand bass, 47 bonito and 28 barracuda. 
The Blackjack fished Catalina with successes of 75 barracuda, 62 bonito and 45 
calico bass. The weekend total at the barge was 320 bonito, 310 mackerel and 45 
sculpin. 
</P>
<P>
From 22nd Street Landing the Firststring worked Catalina for 75 barracuda, 47 
calico bass, 40 sculpin and 19 bonito. The Monte Carlo twilight trip chalked up 
197 sand bass and 25 barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
The Sportking out of L.A. Harbor Sportsfishing headed to Catalina and found 
eager bonito. Anglers bagged 128, plus 70 barracuda, 51 calico bass, one 
yellowtail and a white sea bass. The Matt Walsh half-day trip to the Horseshoe 
ringed in 133 sand bass, 35 calico bass and nine barracuda. The New Shogun 
fished San Clemente Island and landed 180 blue perch, 115 calico bass and five 
sheepshead. The Outerlimits went to Catalina and caught 136 barracuda and 11 
calico bass. On the Annie B. Barge the weekend count was 1,458 croaker, 175 
mackerel, seven sand bass and two halibut. 
</P>
<P>
The Victory worked the oil rigs after leaving Long Beach Sportfishing and the 
sand bass bite was wide open with 277 hooked. Also caught were 56 barracuda and 
two halibut. The Southern Cal twilight trip resulted in a catch of 209 sand 
bass and 25 barracuda. The Toronado tried Catalina and anglers landed 229 
barracuda, 21 calico bass, a white sea bass and a halibut. The El Dorado also 
fished the island and returned with 112 barracuda and 83 calico bass. The 
Chieftain worked the oil rigs and sacked 188 sand bass, 67 barracuda and a 
halibut. 
</P>
<P>
From Belmont Pier the Explorer fished the oil rigs and caught 211 sand bass and 
44 barracuda. 
</P>
<P>
FRESH WATER NOTES: 
</P>
<P>
John Anckles of El Segundo went to Lake Piru and landed a 10-pound catfish. 
Roger Roberts of Long Beach dropped a line with a night crawler on its hook at 
Big Bear Lake and reeled in an 18- 1/2-pound catfish. Cindy Long reeled in a 
10-pound catfish and Randy Long snagged a 12-pound cat at Irvine Lake. They 
live in Lomita.

ICE SKATING TRAINING CENTER; 
</P>
<P>
COUPLE BUILDING A DREAM IN MOUNTAINS 
</P>

LAKE ARROWHEAD 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At first it was the fresh pine scent and glistening lake waters that attracted 
Walter and Carol Probst here to build a summer home a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
Carol, a former professional ice skater who grew up in Compton, spent a lot of 
time at the outdoor ice rink in nearby Blue Jay. Walter, a retired South Bay 
businessman, joined a country club to play golf. 
</P>
<P>
"We were supposed to be retired," Carol said. 
</P>
<P>
Then the town ice rink closed and Carol suddenly realized that a part of her 
went with it. She thought about leaving, but returning to the searing summer 
heat of their permanent residence in Palm Desert wasn't that appealing. 
</P>
<P>
So she and Walter built their own ice rink. 
</P>
<P>
Now, seven years later, they have embarked on another ambitious project, a 
second state-of-the-art rink on a ridge above Blue Jay. It will be the crown 
jewel of what has become the world class Ice Castle International Training 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
The hills in and around Lake Arrowhead are full of private retreats and rural 
conference centers, yet none has drawn as much attention, or grown so quickly, 
as the Ice Castle. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 64 athletes at a time train here, and there is a waiting list that 
includes several international prospects. 
</P>
<P>
Often skaters remain year-round. Said 1980 Olympic figure skating gold medalist 
Robin Cousins, the Ice Castle's director of skating: "This place is so 
conducive to train. It's far enough from the big city that you can get away 
from it all, but it's close enough to keep in contact." 
</P>
<P>
How the Probsts wandered "up the hill" and built one of the world's newest 
training facilities in a sleepy little mountain hamlet 95 mile east of Los 
Angeles is a story in itself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been kind of a challenge," Walter said, standing dwarfed by pine trees 
reaching skyward near the center's 10-acre lodge. He was less than a mile as 
the crow flies from the original Ice Castle, the first rink they opened in Blue 
Jay in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The Probsts built the first rink in a new development on the east side of Blue 
Jay. In combination with an adjacent shopping center and movie theaters, in 
which the Probsts are not involved, the additions nearly doubled the size of 
the town's tiny business strip, which straddles State Highway 173 in a secluded 
valley on the southwest tip of Lake Arrowhead. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the funding for the training center is provided by the Foundation for 
International Ice Skating Advancement, but the majority of its near 
million-dollar annual price tag is footed by the Probsts. They have yet to turn 
a profit but say they are committed to keeping the facility open. 
</P>
<P>
"We just gulp and reach a little deeper," Carol said. "This is something our 
government should be doing to help athletes." 
</P>
<P>
The Probsts also wanted to provide recreation for local youths. Parks and 
sporting fields are rare here. Local kids can be seen hanging out at "in" spots 
such as an arcade in Lake Arrowhead Village. However, last year more than 300 
local youngsters signed up for skating sessions. 
</P>
<P>
"We are the local parks and recreation now," Carol said. 
</P>
<P>
Carol's interest in figure skating pushed the training center concept. The two 
rinks are considered state-of-the-art and include two of the world's first 
360-degree jump harnesses. 
</P>
<P>
Cousins brought an international flavor to the center three years ago. He 
performed in a benefit fund-raiser in Blue Jay, liked the area and stayed on. 
</P>
<P>
Growth continued with the addition of a youth ice hockey program. The Probsts 
do not have a hand in running it, but its success almost from its inception has 
made it the talk of Southern California ice hockey circles. A hockey program 
for women will begin this fall. 
</P>
<P>
The skating staff also grew to 40 full-time employees. Today the center boasts 
some of the world's most skilled instructors, including Senior Ice Castle Vice 
President Frank Carroll, a medal winner in three U.S. national competitions, 
and coach to Linda Fratianne. 
</P>
<P>
The Probsts picked up the nearby 10-acre lodge on a foreclosure sale. They 
refurbished and reopened it as the Ice Castle Conference and Training Center. 
Dormitory rooms for skaters are located here, as are a swimming pool, dining 
hall, outdoor amphitheater, gymnasium and other recreational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"We really lucked out," Carol said. "We could not have afforded to build a 
place like this." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year they broke ground on their second ice rink, a million-dollar 
enclosed training facility that will not open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Skaters range in age from 8 to 24. Since training takes about six hours each 
day, attending the public mountain schools is difficult, so the Probsts plan to 
open a private school on site soon. 
</P>
<P>
"We have found that some of the best skaters are also some of the best 
students," Carol said. "This is such a nice facility, away from all the things 
that get kids into trouble, and we want to keep them here." 
</P>
<P>
Skaters pay $25 a day to live here. Instructor fees are extra. 
</P>
<P>
Six skaters have qualified for national figure-skating competition and Carol 
says that several foreign athletes training here give the center "at least 12 
skaters who could very easily qualify" for Olympic competition. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing a black jump suit and sipping coffee, Carol sat rinkside as dozens of 
youngsters went through workouts at the Ice Castle recently. 
</P>
<P>
"I could sit here all day," she said, glancing at the skaters. "Trouble is, I 
wouldn't get any work done." 
</P>
<P>
As Carroll and Cousins put the skaters through stroking drills, Carol smiled. 
</P>
<P>
"Winning championships is not our main goal," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Carol turned pro at 18. She said she learned early in her youth that training 
for Olympic competition was not for her. 
</P>
<P>
"I would get nervous. I was not competitive material." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, she turned to figure skating after graduating from Compton High School 
in 1952. Her career spanned a decade with the Ice Follies. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to teach these kids how to meet their own goals, whatever they are, 
not to just meet our goals," Carol said. 
</P>
<P>
Walter views the center a bit differently with a hint of red, white and blue. 
</P>
<P>
"I love to see the kids develop. I want to get them off to a good start. 
Anything I can do so our U.S. athletes can compete successfully . . . . Some of 
these kids are going to make it." 
</P>
<P>
Cousins said he came to work in Blue Jay because of the mountain community, its 
good training altitude of about 5,100 feet and the facility's ambiance. 
</P>
<P>
"The place itself is so beautiful compared to other places that I have seen 
skaters train in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Probsts joke about the center's lack of profit. "If we do (turn a profit) 
we'll throw a big party," said Walter. 
</P>
<P>
To make ends meet, the Probsts rent the training center for weekend business 
retreats, weddings and receptions. Carol displayed a honeymoon cottage for a 
visitor, which she decorated in country French. Quaint, it rents for about $100 
a day, including meals and use of all center facilities. The Probsts hope to 
attract more clients from metropolitan areas by including ski packages with 
local resorts this winter. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 10 million people within 50 miles of this place," Walter said. "The 
population up here just is not enough to support a place like this." 
</P>
<P>
As the center grew, the additional workload was taxing. The Probsts went 
through a half dozen supervisors in the Ice Castle's first few seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you can find anyone who has (managed a facility) like this 
before because there isn't one like it," said center manager Dennis Senior, who 
has been with the Ice Castle for about a year. He previously worked in a major 
hotel chain. 
</P>
<P>
Ice time, a precious commodity in Southern California, can be maximized for 
additional revenue, Walter said. He expects the rink in Blue Jay to operate all 
but four hours a day, seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
Seated later in an office at the training center, Walter and Carol spoke of the 
personal time they may have had had they not got involved with skating here. 
Walter would be playing golf on exclusive desert courses and Carol would 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
From May to October, however, they spend just about every day at the rink or 
the center. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll go home (to the desert) in October," Carol said. 
</P>
<P>
Walter chuckled. "But you'll drive up here at least once a week." 
</P>
<P>
Said Carol: "It's always something."

The trendiest art opening we've seen lately was held for photographer 
Joel-Peter Witkin at the Sahey/Klein Gallery on tres-trendy La Brea Avenue. 
Standing in line outside was Gigi (Getty) Gaston, wondering whether this was a 
special screening of "Batman," because the line went halfway around the block. 
That didn't stop Richard Gere, a Witkin collector who looked nearly as gray as 
the artist's photos -- gray sweater, gray pants and nearly a full head of gray 
hair, which friends report is the natural color. Unnaturally indistinguishable 
from the rest of the crowd was Jodie Foster, with her hair pulled back to 
accentuate a pair of particularly, shall we say, unfashionable glasses. Hard to 
spot in the throng were model Cindy Crawford, actress Rebecca de Mornay, actor 
Dennis Hopper and director Paul Bartel. For those less familiar with his style, 
Witkin's photo subjects are hermaphrodites, dwarfs, pre-op transsexuals, 
amputees and hunchbacks. And he's always looking for new models.

Geena Davis on Parade 
</P>
<P>
Actress Geena Davis came home to Wareham, Mass., population 18,000, over the 
weekend and served as grand marshal of the town's 250th anniversary parade. The 
Oscar winner and erstwhile organist at Wareham's First Congregational Church 
wore a peach satin Colonial-style gown and sat on the back of a 1955 Cadillac 
El Dorado convertible. "Where she got the idea she was going to be a movie 
star, I can't say," her mother offered. The family permitted her to watch only 
Walt Disney movies, Davis remembered. "She wasn't one to go out every Friday 
night," her mother added. "She was very much into crafts. She'd buy leather and 
make pocketbooks." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Adventures in Leather 
</P>
<P>
Nino Cerruti had a visitor from Hollywood recently. Bruce Willis stopped in at 
the designer's Paris shop looking for a leather bomber jacket. He'll wear more 
suede and leather looks in "Hudson Hawk," an adventure movie he's filming now. 
The movie's likely to be a real fashion show. The designer is Marilyn Vance, 
who dressed Kevin Costner and Sean Connery so stylishly in "The Untouchables" a 
couple of summers ago. She's been shopping for the new film at Cerruti's Paris 
showroom.

Exposure Sale 
</P>
<P>
For sale: one hipper-than-thou Los Angeles-based magazine, distributed in more 
than 150 cities around the country. Rumor has it that a major East Coast 
publishing corporation is in negotiations with Exposure magazine publisher 
Henry Shea and editor-in-chief Cavin Shorter. And the price? Let's see. If 
Details magazine went to Conde Nast for more than $2 million, and L.A. Style 
went to American Express for more than $4 million, and Interview went to a 
conglomerate for more than $10 million, what can we expect for the L.A. born 
and bred Exposure? When Listen requested the figures, those in the know 
buttoned their lips. "We're in the talking stages only," advised Shorter.

'POSTCARD' IS TOO HEAVY ON THE MORALIZING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Don Victor is a funny man. He would be funnier, one suspects, if he would relax 
and just let the fun flow. 
</P>
<P>
"Picture Postcard," Victor's most ambitious piece yet, at Sushi Performance 
Gallery through July 22, has evolved since being commissioned for this year's 
Neofest. It began as a series of characters in a small town. That proved 
constricting, so Victor opened it up as a series of six people he has known, 
beginning with himself as a child (a scenario that sinks him into an 
uncomfortable case of the cutes) and ending with himself as an old man. 
</P>
<P>
Not a bad idea to sketch out the times of one's life -- those lived and yet to 
be lived -- but somewhere along the line, Victor got the idea that all these 
monologues are supposed to have a theme and so, of course, he tells us what the 
theme is, does the monologue and then tells us what he told us. 
</P>
<P>
The theme then gets repeated in between every segment in a sonorous tone. There 
are people who are square pegs in round holes and such people are important. 
</P>
<P>
The show is a picture-perfect example of why most ideas are better shown than 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Postcard" is as uneven as the selection of material. It's hard to resist 
Victor's cowboy, who proudly sings only one kind of music -- the "really bad" 
kind. It's harder to buy him as a waitress; as nicely written as the piece is, 
the swaying makes him seem more effeminate than feminine. 
</P>
<P>
One of Victor's great gifts is his skill at improvisation. He uses the audience 
to great advantage as the storyteller who solicits bizarre word contributions 
to what gets to be a wildly improbable story. At one point Friday night he had 
a duck-billed platypus driving along the road with a smoking pistol, a cannibal 
and Superman, and made it all work. 
</P>
<P>
But the heaviness of many of his other choices makes one long for the good old 
days when he did light-hearted pieces like Chef Jean Bob, who taught his 
students to "caress their food" before they hacked it to bits; the argument he 
used to have with the tape recorder that kept interrupting him; the song he 
used to sing to Whoopi Goldberg, one of his former comedy partners. And why not 
work the creation of Hedz, the bizarre clay figurines that he makes and sells, 
into the show? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe the problem lies in the very title of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Let's face it, there's nothing funny about the name "Picture Postcard." No one 
is objecting to jokes with meaningful reverberations a la Kathy &amp; Mo school 
of comedy. But meaningful reverberations should sneak up on you unawares, not 
tug and strain like a moral in search of an illustrating joke. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Victor should rename the show "Don Victor Having Fun" and do just that. 
The audience would have more fun, too. 
</P>
<P>
And they would still learn something. Don Victor has a lot to say.

The paparazzi has been out in force in Manhattan where Marlon Brando is at work 
in one of his rare feature films. "The Freshman" has been shooting in New 
York's Little Italy section, setting the neighborhood abuzz as fans try to 
catch a glimpse of the superstar actor. A crew member told Reuters that the new 
movie is a "Mafia comedy," but Brando's publicists won't go that far. "Brando 
plays a distributor. Matthew Broderick plays a film student. That's all I can 
say," says Debbie Nathan, a spokeswoman for the production. ALEENE MacMINN

AT THE GALLERIES / LEAH OLLMAN: LATINO SHOW OFFERS HONEST CROSS-SECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Leah Ollman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For all of their reliance on visual sensitivity, museum curators and gallery 
directors have been profoundly insensitive to artists of shades other than 
white. 
</P>
<P>
Artists of non-European ethnic descent, as well as women artists, have long 
been relegated to the shadows of the American art world. Major exhibition 
spaces rarely feature them, partially because those who make such choices are, 
themselves, predominantly white and male. 
</P>
<P>
A spirit of revisionism has emerged in the last few years, however, and the art 
community is beginning to take measures to compensate for its long-standing 
biases. Traveling survey shows, like the recent "Hispanic Art in the United 
States" and "The Latin American Spirit" (at the San Diego Museum of Art through 
Sunday), are two of the most visible manifestations of this effort to revise 
traditional histories of art, making them more inclusive. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the over-zealous organizers of these shows attempt to correct 
decades of neglect in single, sweeping gestures. In the process, they promote 
an artificial, homogenizing view of their subjects. 
</P>
<P>
To have an enduring impact, the revisionist spirit must yield more than just 
efforts to sum up the art of an overlooked period, region or group, and then 
tuck it away again, out of sight, as if exhausted. It must inject museum 
curators, gallery directors and scholars with the urge to dig deeper into 
realms that had long been considered peripheral. It must encourage them to move 
this work to the center, expose it and let it speak for itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Latin Alternatives," opening today at the David Zapf Gallery (2400 Kettner 
Blvd., through Aug. 12), embodies this spirit without suffering its pitfalls. 
Without great fanfare or lofty theoretical pretense, the show presents a small 
sampling of work by six Latino artists. It challenges the suspicious notion 
that all artists loosely labeled "Latino" or "Hispanic" share a common 
vocabulary of subject matter and styles. Instead, the show confirms that a 
healthy pluralism prevails among such artists, as among artists in general in 
the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Ethnicity surfaces in these works no more than in any cross-section of 
contemporary art. The paintings of Santiago Vaca, a native of Ecuador, are 
insistently political, a trait that is often associated with the politically 
volatile nations of Latin America. His painting, "The Interrogation Room," 
shrieks with the terror of political oppression, but a confrontational approach 
to such disturbing subject matter can also be found in the politically charged 
art of North Americans Leon Golub and Sue Coe. 
</P>
<P>
Vaca's work also has a cooler, more ironic side that yields an even more 
scathing indictment of abused power. In "The Pope's Visit to Chile," he chides 
the intimacy between the church and the military, the institutionalized forces 
of religion and death, by picturing the Pope bent over a skeleton in an 
ambiguous pose. A veil of paint nearly whitewashes the underlying foundation of 
bones that supports both the image and the power structure it portrays. 
</P>
<P>
In the color-saturated landscapes of Los Angeles-based painter Raoul de la 
Sota, Spanish titles and Mexican locales are all that hint of the artist's 
cultural identity. These factors are negligible, though, for De la Sota's main 
concerns are the universal elements of light and color. 
</P>
<P>
In "Noche de Nopal," he bestows a dense, twisting mass of cactus with an 
artificial, theatrical glow. The spiny plant's gestural form lends it a human 
quality, and its lurid violets, reds and mauves give the teeming mass a 
restless, anxious presence. 
</P>
<P>
For San Diegan David Avalos, contemporary urban culture provides icons of 
greater urgency and currency than the traditional, sacred symbols of the 
church. His "Hubcap Milagro" consists of layer upon layer of potent sexual, 
societal and religious references. 
</P>
<P>
David Diaz is represented by a series of prints that illustrate a book of 
poetry, and another series inspired by three Zora Neale Hurston works of 
fiction and folklore. The beauty of these silk screen prints, their rich, 
velvety color and woodblock-like effect, is engaging, but, given their 
illustrative purpose, they need the collaboration of their texts to feel 
complete, and those are not provided here. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Salvatierra, a graduate student at UC San Diego, employs an equally 
imaginative and absorbing technique in his moody scenes of boat wrecks. 
Salvatierra sets the weighty, silhouetted vessels along the bottom of his 
horizontal panels, and lets the boards' plywood grain speak for the hazy, 
haunting sky. 
</P>
<P>
Tijuana artist Romel Rosas indulges in light-hearted whimsy in his "Video 
Reflection Series;" his "Mal de Ojo (Evil Eye)" drawings carry more weight. 
Vague, ethereal faces stare out from each sheet, while a hand extends a small 
object -- a radio, a screw -- as if the purveyor of supernatural powers. Drawn 
in delicate, cloudy grays, the faces exude an odd, slightly disconcerting 
magnetism. 
</P>
<P>
These artists hardly need the coddling embrace of affirmative action. The 
exposure it affords serves them well, however, as long as it allows their work 
to speak for itself, and not for an entire ethnic community. 
</P>

HOWELL HELPS GIVE DODGERS SECOND-HALF RESTART, 3-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Usually it is just another baseball word that doesn't really mean what it says. 
Usually it is a word, applying to relief pitchers, that is nothing more than a 
statistic. 
</P>
<P>
But then there are nights like Thursday, when, in front of 23 fidgety Dodger 
teammates, reliever Jay Howell truly recorded a save. 
</P>
<P>
With five pitches in the ninth inning against the St. Louis Cardinals, Howell 
saved not just a game, but a feeling -- the best feeling these Dodgers have had 
since the start of summer. For a team stumbling away from a first-half crash, 
he saved a second-half start. 
</P>
<P>
Entering the game with one out and runners on first and second and the Dodgers 
leading, 3-1, he allowed a run-scoring single to Jose Oquendo but retired John 
Morris and Leon Durham on three pitches to close out a 3-2 victory before 
33,358 fans at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"To use an expression -- he's been a lifesaver," Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda 
said of Howell. 
</P>
<P>
"To let the team down tonight would have been a crime," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers returned to work following the three-day All-Star break in pleasant 
spirits. First, there was a short pregame talk by Lasorda. Then there was a 
quick run in the first inning on Eddie Murray's RBI single, one of his three 
hits and two runs batted in. Then there was starter Orel Hershiser, allowing 
just four hits and one run, on a bases-loaded walk, in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the ninth. Hershiser allowed a one-out ground single to right field 
by Terry Pendleton. Two pitches later, Tom Brunansky grounded a single to the 
other side. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just working on reserve then," said Hershiser, who threw 119 pitches. "I 
didn't have the bullets to get out of it." 
</P>
<P>
So, in from left field walked the Dodgers' late-night weapon. He stopped calmly 
in the outfield to hand his jacket to a bat boy. He calmly threw his warm-up 
pitches and got ready to face Oquendo, who at the time had 15 hits in 30 
at-bats this season against the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
"He's batting about 1.000 against us, so I figured the odds are in my favor 
that he'd pop one up," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
Oquendo threw out his bat, and the ball bounced off it into right field for an 
RBI single to make it 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
"Guess he proved me wrong," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
His logic and instincts having failed him, Howell then turned to his memory for 
help. The next batter was pinch-hitter Morris, who faced Howell last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I remembered that he had spanked a first-pitch fastball to center field 
against me, so I figured he might go for the first pitch again," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
And so Morris did, grounding the ball to Murray at first base for the second 
out. But the runners moved up, and with pinch-hitter Durham batting, Howell's 
strategy changed. 
</P>
<P>
"I had first base open, so I could afford to try more different things with 
him," Howell said. "But with a guy on third base, I couldn't afford to try a 
curveball and bounce it past the catcher and have the guy score the tying run." 
</P>
<P>
Translated: He needed to throw fastballs, but he could throw them anywhere he 
wanted. He chose the inside of the plate. 
</P>
<P>
He threw strike one there, and then strike two, and Durham finally grew tired 
of watching. Howell's next pitch was a waist-high strike, but Durham swung and 
missed, and the Dodgers had won. 
</P>
<P>
With Howell pitching, nobody really expected anything different. 
</P>
<P>
When asked about Howell, Kirk Gibson simply said, "Hey, how many has the guy 
blown?" 
</P>
<P>
The answer is two. In 18 save opportunities, Howell has 16 saves and has 
allowed just four earned runs in 47 innings for an 0.77 earned-run average. 
Considering that his career ERA is 3.53, he is having the season of his life, 
or most relief pitchers' lives. 
</P>
<P>
Not everybody appreciates this. Cincinnati Reds reliever Rob Dibble, when 
learning that Howell made the All-Star team, sarcastically said, "So, big, bad 
Jay Howell made the All-Star team." 
</P>
<P>
Howell shrugged. "His comments speak for themselves," he said. "I know I 
wouldn't have said anything bad about him if he made the team. This winter, the 
Dodgers said, 'We appreciate you,' by giving me the three-year contract (worth 
$3 million). That said it loud and clear." 
</P>
<P>
And Thursday illustrated that worth plain and simple. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't waste efforts like tonight," Howell said. 
</P>
<P>
He was talking about many things, among them the 8 1/3 good innings by 
Hershiser that ultimately made him 10-7 while lowering his ERA to 2.45. Anybody 
want to guess his record at this time last season? It was 13-4 with a 2.62 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured it was about the same," Hershiser said. "We just don't have quite as 
good of a team as last year yet." 
</P>
<P>
Howell also saved the good efforts of Murray, who has 14 hits in his last 41 
at-bats (.341) to raise his average to .247. He was the main reason the Dodgers 
finally figured out Thursday's starter and loser, Ken Hill, a rookie who was 
2-0 with an 0.78 ERA against them in three previous starts this season. 
</P>
<P>
Somebody wondered if, as Murray saw more pitchers for the second and third 
times in this league, whether he wouldn't be ruining a lot more nights. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always easier when you see somebody for a second or third time," Murray 
said. "It makes hitting a little more comfortable. And I'm getting a little 
more comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Alfredo Griffin's hot streak, in which he has 48 hits in his last 140 at-bats 
(.343), is even more impressive considering what is on his mind. Griffin, who 
had two more hits Thursday to improve his batting average to .280, said that he 
has been worried about his sick mother, who is hospitalized in the Dominican 
Republic. He visited her over the All-Star break and is trying to bring her to 
the United States for the first time. "She's been sick for a long time, so I'm 
prepared for it, but it's still hard," Griffin said. "When I go see her, she is 
happy, and when I leave she is sad. I want to get her over by my side. But she 
never wants to leave our home." . . . Tim Leary confirmed Thursday that he has 
been sent to the bullpen. While he didn't sound thrilled about it, he said he 
was too excited over last week's birth of his baby girl to be mad. "I'm still 
high from the baby; I don't have time to get angry," Leary said. "I still think 
my best value is as a starter." The Dodgers told Leary he would probably start 
in one of the two doubleheaders next weekend in Pittsburgh and that his 
situation could possibly be re-evaluated after that. "I'll wait until then and 
see what happens," Leary said. . . . John Dempsey, son of Dodger catcher Rick 
Dempsey, has signed a contract with the St. Louis Cardinals and will join an 
instructional league team in Phoenix Saturday. Dempsey, a catcher at Crespi 
High School, was the Cardinals' 10th-round draft pick in June. . . . 
Albuquerque pitcher Ramon Martinez, likely to be 
</P>
<P>
in a Dodger uniform by Monday afternoon as the starting pitcher against the 
Chicago Cubs, was the starter and winner Wednesday night in the triple-A 
All-Star game at Columbus, Ohio. In leading the National League minor leaguers 
to a win over the American League prospects, Martinez allowed one run in three 
innings.

JIM MURRAY: TO BE OR NOT TO BE MISQUOTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has come to the attention of Elizabethan literary scholars that one of their 
eminent colleagues, the Rt. Hon. Michael Tyson, Esq, has taken to the public 
prints to misquote -- perish the thought! -- Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
Michael got his tongue twisted when he was trying to chastise another 
world-class author, the quondam light-heavyweight boxing champion of the world, 
Jose Torres, for scandalous references in print to Tyson's notions of safe sex 
(hit her with the best punch you ever threw). 
</P>
<P>
While it's refreshing to find a heavyweight champion of the world who reads 
Shakespeare -- Tyson is the first since Gene Tunney -- there are those of us 
who suspect a bit of ventriloquism here. 
</P>
<P>
Just as there are some people who think Shakespeare didn't write Shakespeare, 
there are some who think Tyson didn't quote him. 
</P>
<P>
Don King gets the nod as the man behind the curtain here. Don, you see, is 
Tyson's consultant, adviser and running mate. 
</P>
<P>
And, Don, it is well known, became a world-class litterateur in the period 
(several years) when he was a regular customer at the Ohio State penitentiary 
library. 
</P>
<P>
Don can quote Shakespeare at the drop of a lunch check, particularly if it 
speeds up negotiations. In Don's favor. 
</P>
<P>
It's inevitable Don would weigh in with a malapropism or two -- even the 
college professors have to look up Bartlett's Quotations from time to time -- 
but what Don had Michael saying was a Bartlett's Misquotations. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Author Torres, the champ said, "I think it was Shakespeare (Note: 
this is fine pedantic form; even when you're positive, in academic circles, 
modesty -- and diffidence -- demands you throw in this disclaimer) who said, 'I 
love the act of treason but I hate the traitor.' " 
</P>
<P>
Well, of course, it doesn't matter what Mike thinks. It was Julius Caesar who 
(according to Plutarch) said that. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a serious mistake, to be sure. It's not as if Don King, who would like 
to be Tyson's manager if only Bill Cayton would step aside and stop getting 
injunctions, put collodion in Mike's eyes between rounds or matched him with 
somebody who could fight back. 
</P>
<P>
Still, it opens up whole new vistas for the once and future heavyweight king. 
Now that Olivier's gone, he can become the world's foremost spouter of 
Shakespeare and can find that the Bard had something to say about every human 
experience. It's just a matter of having Don King sort them out for him. 
</P>
<P>
Take the following, for example: 
</P>
<P>
 "What is she but a foul contending rebel, 
</P>
<P>
 And graceless traitor to her loving Lord? 
</P>
<P>
 I am ashamed that women are so simple 
</P>
<P>
 To offer war where they should kneel for peace 
</P>
<P>
 Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway 
</P>
<P>
 Where they are bound to serve, love and obey." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the great Will wrote that about Kate, the untamed shrew, but Mike might 
want to apply it to his dear, departed Robin, mightn't he? 
</P>
<P>
 "Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed, 
</P>
<P>
 That he is grown so great? Age thou art shamed! 
</P>
<P>
 Rome, thou has lost the breed of noble bloods!" 
</P>
<P>
 This, of course, could apply to Mike himself. If not, certainly to Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me have men about me that are fat 
</P>
<P>
 "Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o'nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yound Cassius has a lean and hungry look; 
</P>
<P>
 "He thinks too much: such men are dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 This could refer to, in order, (1) Don King and (2) Bill Cayton -- except when 
the Bard wrote "sleek-headed," he didn't exactly have Don King in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beggars mounted run their horses to death." 
</P>
<P>
 This could apply to any of Mike's fellow pugs who earned millions but died 
broke. 
</P>
<P>
 "A gentleman that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak more in a minute 
than he will stand to in a month." 
</P>
<P>
Once again, the great Will seems to have anticipated Don King. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mislike me not for my complexion, 
</P>
<P>
 "The shadow'd livery of the burnished sun." 
</P>
<P>
This piece of Shakespearean advice (from "The Merchant of Venice") stands 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "O God! That men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their 
brains; that we should with joy, pleasance, revel and applause, transform 
ourselves into beasts." 
</P>
<P>
For any athlete who gives up a career for crack, who sells his birthright for a 
mess of pot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have judgment here; that we but teach 
</P>
<P>
 "Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return 
</P>
<P>
 "To plague the inventor; this even-handed justice 
</P>
<P>
 "Commends the ingredients of our poisoned chalice 
</P>
<P>
 "To our own lips." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oklahoma football program? 
</P>
<P>
 "O! That this too too solid flesh would melt 
</P>
<P>
 "Thaw and resolve itself into a dew." 
</P>
<P>
 For a Tommy Lasorda for whom thin is win. 
</P>
<P>
 "My library 
</P>
<P>
 "Was dukedom large enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Don King again. 
</P>
<P>
The scholar Tyson could have some advice from Stratford-Upon-Avon for the 
sorely beset baseballer, Pete Rose: 
</P>
<P>
 "The world is not thy friend nor the world's law." And: 
</P>
<P>
 "The purest treasure mortal times afford 
</P>
<P>
 "Is a spotless reputation." 
</P>
<P>
The Greeks might have had a word for it, but the Bard had a paragraph. As for 
sportswriters, Will had the words for them, too: 
</P>
<P>
 "He jests at scars that never felt a wound."

NFL CONTROVERSIES; 
</P>
<P>
UNION OFFERS PLAN TO CHECK DRUG-TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND and RANDY HARVEY, Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The aim of the National Football League's drug program, as well as its accuracy 
and fairness, was challenged Thursday by the NFL Players Assn., which revealed 
its own plan to enhance the program and also serve as a check on the league. 
</P>
<P>
But the NFL quickly rejected the plan, which was announced in a news conference 
at Atlanta by the union's executive director, Gene Upshaw. 
</P>
<P>
According to the NFLPA plan, urine samples collected by the league in preseason 
tests of all players starting this summer would be split into two portions. One 
would be analyzed by the NFL, the other by a laboratory contracted by the 
union. 
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of this plan is to protect the players," Upshaw said. "This will 
be a check on the league so that we can be sure there are no mistakes, no 
tampering or inaccurate results. We intend to collect, label, test and store 
our samples at a federally-certified testing facility." 
</P>
<P>
But NFL spokesman Joe Browne said that the plan is too unwieldly. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want to have a second test, they can do so," Browne said. "But it 
would have to be at a time other than our test. That's due to the logistics 
involved and the numerous steps in our chain of custody (of the samples) 
procedure." 
</P>
<P>
Browne also said that even if the plan were acceptable to the NFL, it would be 
too late to implement this summer. One team, the Rams, opened its training camp 
for rookies Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"They are proposing this new approach rather late," Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
Upshaw said he discussed the plan last week with Commissioner Pete Rozelle, who 
said the league could not agree to such a program. 
</P>
<P>
"What do they have to hide?" Upshaw asked. 
</P>
<P>
Upshaw said the plan was approved by the NFLPA Board of Player Representatives 
on June 11, but the announcement appeared timed to follow publication of a 
special report in the July 10 edition of Sports Illustrated that said there are 
"widespread irregularities, inconsistencies and misrepresentations in nearly 
every facet of the NFL's drug program." 
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the "administrative competence and adherence to 
accepted drug-testing standards" of the league's drug adviser, Dr. Forest 
Tennant, have been found "seriously wanting." Tennant administers Community 
Health Projects, Inc., which includes two dozen methadone clinics in Fresno, 
Santa Barbara and the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the NFL: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Exaggerates the drug problem among players to justify a tough testing 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Subjects players to reasonable-cause testing, above and beyond the regular 
preseason testing agreed to by the NFLPA, based on a number of criteria, 
including "aberrant behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Does not protect player confidentiality as required by its agreement with 
the NFLPA. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Does not secure the urine samples to guarantee against tampering and 
contamination. 
</P>
<P>
The report also said that many players and their agents believe the league 
plays favorites, warning some popular players in advance about impending drug 
tests or otherwise protecting them. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times before the news conference, Upshaw accused the 
league of also targeting certain players for intensified drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
"First, most of all of those (who have been suspended) were black," he said. 
"They were having contract problems or in the midst of negotiating or about to 
start contract negotiations. Lastly, they were having other problems away from 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
"There could have been some sort of hit list developed by NFL Securities. They 
have a network of ex-federal and law enforcement people to find out what 
players are doing or what kind of off-the-field problems they have. The NFL 
police force is gathering information and determining when to use it and how to 
use it." 
</P>
<P>
Browne said that the NFL treats all players equally in its drug program. "I can 
categorically deny that we were out to discipline certain individuals," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the news conference, Upshaw also announced the formation of a Chemical 
Dependency Prevention Committee to develop a drug education program for 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"We are also concerned that the league's current plan is not geared toward 
rehabilitation," he said. "It appears to be directed only toward penalties and 
punishment." 
</P>
<P>
Browne again disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been countless man-hours and dollars spent by the clubs on that 
phase of the league's overall program, on that phase of rehabilitation," he 
said. "The treatment and counseling are available to each of the 28 clubs and 
through the league facilities if the player seeks it." 
</P>
<P>
Tennant also defended the NFL's program against criticism from the NFLPA and 
Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
"We have for years been criticized in sports that we are not doing our duty, 
that we are not accepting and carrying out our responsibilities of cleaning up 
the drug problem," he said. "We have been criticized for not testing enough, 
for doing too much rehabilitation and counseling and education . . . 
</P>
<P>
"(Now) they said we're too tough, to back off." 
</P>
<P>
As for the criticism of his credentials and practices in the Sports Illustrated 
report, Tennant said: "I'm not going to address the personal attacks. I haven't 
gotten used to them, but I get them. If anybody believes anything about me that 
Sports Illustrated wrote, they can come to our organization and take a look for 
themselves."

ARIZONA FOOTBALL PLAYER DIAGNOSED WITH FORM OF ACUTE LEUKEMIA

University of Arizona football player Kevin Singleton has been diagnosed with a 
form of acute leukemia and began chemotherapy several days ago because his 
condition was potentially fatal, a cancer specialist said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Singleton, a 6-foot-2, 231-pound senior linebacker who was an All-Pacific 10 
Conference honorable mention selection last season, was hospitalized last 
Friday at University Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert M. Rifkin, associate director of the bone marrow transplant program 
at the Arizona Cancer Center, said it was important that Singleton's leukemia 
was detected "almost within a week, or less," of developing. 
</P>
<P>
Rifkin said Singleton is undergoing a three- to four-week therapy that will be 
followed by another chemotherapy regimen of four to six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"There is at least an 80% chance in Kevin's case of attaining complete 
remission at the three-week mark, so I think that those are fairly good odds," 
Rifkin said. 
</P>
<P>
After the second treatment phase, further chemotherapy could be possible, or 
doctors could decide to attempt a transplant of bone marrow from his brother 
Chris, an identical twin, Rifkin said.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: KNBC GIVES ROGGIN NEW CONTRACT, DOUBLES HIS SALARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Larry Stewart 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest piece of news during a busy week in TV sports is that Fred Roggin, 
according to a source, has agreed to a new long-term contract with KNBC, 
Channel 4, that will double his salary from about $350,000 to about $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
Roggin's contract wasn't due to expire until June of next year, but Channel 4, 
in order to keep its lead sportscaster from possibly going to another station 
in town, gave Roggin a new contract, the source said. Both Channel 2 and 
Channel 7 had been rumored to be after Roggin. 
</P>
<P>
It was also learned that Roggin met with NBC Sports bosses Dick Ebersol and 
Terry O'Neil Thursday morning to discuss possible network assignments and that 
things went well. 
</P>
<P>
Some might wonder if Bob Costas was behind the move that resulted in O.J. 
Simpson replacing Ahmad Rashad on NBC's "NFL Live" next fall. Costas and Rashad 
have had their differences in the past. 
</P>
<P>
Costas, at a March of Dimes benefit in New York last year, introduced a number 
of NFL Hall of Famers, then introduced Rashad by saying, "And here's someone 
who will never make anybody's Hall of Fame." 
</P>
<P>
Rashad thought the comment was out of place, and let Costas know it. 
</P>
<P>
In his book, Rashad generally praised Costas, but TV Guide pulled out some 
negative excerpts in which Rashad criticized Costas for, among other things, 
being too cutesy. 
</P>
<P>
That put more strain on their relationship, but colleagues say the two have 
gotten along very well recently and that Costas wanted Rashad to remain on the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
It reportedly was Rashad's decision to switch to game commentating. 
</P>
<P>
NBC's Ebersol and O'Neil are convinced that Simpson will do better in the 
studio than he did as a commentator. 
</P>
<P>
Now the pressure is on Simpson to come through. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson, by the way, worked as a commentator for NBC from 1978 through '82 
before joining ABC's "Monday Night Football." 
</P>
<P>
ABC dropped Simpson after the 1985 season. 
</P>
<P>
At least, NBC hasn't hired former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
It's amazing that Reagan couldn't handle last Tuesday's All-Star guest 
appearance any better than he did. 
</P>
<P>
A little over six months ago, this man was running our country. 
</P>
<P>
One of Reagan's people who obviously knows nothing about sports asked if the 
former President's appearance could be pre-taped and edited. 
</P>
<P>
It was explained to the aide that that would be pretty difficult to do on a 
live event. 
</P>
<P>
But in retrospect, maybe Reagan should have been taped. It's obvious he doesn't 
do well without a script. 
</P>
<P>
A class guy: When a San Francisco TV station, KGO, reported last Monday night 
that Bill Walsh would replace Merlin Olsen as NBC's No. 1 commentator, Ebersol 
and O'Neil, both in Anaheim for the All-Star game, called Olsen immediately and 
said they were on their way to his home in San Marino to talk to him. 
</P>
<P>
Olsen, however, said he would meet them halfway -- at a restaurant in Commerce. 
It was there he told them that he was a team player and would accept a lesser 
position. 
</P>
<P>
So Olsen will work with Charlie Jones instead of Dick Enberg. That's good news 
for Jones, since he and Olsen are good friends and business partners in a La 
Jolla production company called C&amp;M. 
</P>
<P>
Secret audition: On June 24, Dick Enberg flew from London, where he had begun 
covering Wimbledon, to New York and went to Stamford, Conn., to do an audition 
with Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
Why Stamford? Because the studio there is used by the World Wrestling 
Federation, and all kinds of people are in and out of there. The thinking was 
that no one would pay much attention to Walsh and Enberg. 
</P>
<P>
NBC wanted the audition to be secret for a couple of reasons. One, had things 
not gone well, then no one would have been the wiser. And if things did go well 
and Walsh accepted the job, as he did, NBC wanted to save the announcement for 
a major press conference itwill hold in Los Angeles this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
But KGO apparently got wind of what was going on from its weather reporter, a 
woman who reportedly is a close friend of Walsh's. 
</P>
<P>
Of Walsh's audition, O'Neil was quoted as saying: "He was just sensational. He 
said things that we have never heard an analyst say before. . . . He took a 
complex matter and made it understandable in the most difficult circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Recommended viewing: Roy Firestone is the host, producer and writer of a 
one-hour syndicated show, "Mike Tyson: the People's Champion," that will be on 
Channel 2 Saturday at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"You'll see a different side of Tyson," Firestone said, "a more positive side. 
We stayed away from Robin Givens and some of the negative aspects of his past 
and concentrated on things like his working with retarded children." 
</P>
<P>
The guests include Eddie Murphy, Chevy Chase, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Don King, 
Arsenio Hall, Donald Trump, Larry Merchant and Larry King. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN is getting close to selecting its baseball announcers for next year, and 
Chris Berman is one play-by-play possibility. He says he'd love to do it. 
</P>
<P>
The only bad part -- for viewers, not for Berman -- is it would take him out of 
the studio, where he is excellent. He's glib, knowledgeable, humorous and comes 
across as a regular guy. And he's the same guy off the air as on. 
</P>
<P>
Berman probably would be a very good play-by-play announcer. Wonder if ESPN 
would let him use his nicknames? 
</P>
<P>
A dreamy idea: ESPN this week announced plans for a new show, "Dream Season," 
which will begin an eight-week run Sept. 3. 
</P>
<P>
The series, produced by NFL Films, will, through some imaginative editing, show 
old teams playing current teams in fantasy games. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the first week the 1985 Chicago Bears take on the 1977 Dallas 
Cowboys. The winner, predetermined by a computer, is a well-guarded secret. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Sabol, president of NFL Films, showed a group of television writers a 
tape of the show this week, and it was amazing. Imagine seeing Refrigerator 
Perry sacking Roger Staubach. He doesn't really, but it almost looks like it. 
</P>
<P>
Each one-hour show will feature one fantasy game, plus highlights from other 
fantasy games as well as pre- and post-game shows, and halftime highlights. 
</P>
<P>
Sabol and Merrill Reese, the voice of the Philadelphia Eagles, will call the 
action, with Berman handling the halftime highlights. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-week season will conclude Oct. 29 with a "Dream Bowl," in which a 
champion will be crowned. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Turner Broadcasting announced this week that since the Turner Television 
Network, TNT, now reaches more than 30 million households, Turner's National 
Basketball Assn. package will switch from TBS to TNT next season. 
</P>
<P>
Take away the Angels from the new SportsChannel and you don't have much, 
certainly not enough to warrant a $10-$14 monthly fee, which some cable 
companies are still asking. . . . Prime Ticket, a basic service that is 
provided to cable subscribers at no additional cost, this week announced a 
major deal with Tri-Crown Productions. The result will be four one-hour 
specials and 11 half-hour specials on the Lakers and Kings and other 
programming for later this year. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Meyers did a nice job filling in on KMPC last Sunday for Angel announcer 
Al Conin, who took his birthday off. Meyers worked very well with Ken Brett, 
getting more opinions and comments out of him than Conin does. Conin always 
seems more concerned with his voice inflections than he does with what he says 
or what he gets Brett to say. 
</P>
<P>
Texas' Nolan Ryan (10-4) faces Cleveland's Greg Swindell (11-2) Saturday, but 
of course NBC won't show it. Instead, the NBC Game of the Week in most of the 
country, including Los Angeles, will be the Kansas City Royals playing the 
Yankees in New York. The rest of the country gets Boston-Minnesota. . . . 
Showtime offers a good fight, Evander Holyfield vs. Brazilian Adilson 
Rodrigues, Saturday night at 7 from Caesars Tahoe. KALI (1430) will carry the 
Spanish-language broadcast. . . . It's a shame that no Los Angeles radio 
station is carrying Bob Costas' excellent syndicated Sunday night show, 
"Costas: Coast to Coast," now that KFI has dropped it. KLAC is considering 
picking it up.

St. Louis, a member of the Major Indoor Soccer League for nine seasons until 
the Steamers folded last year, has been awarded an expansion franchise for the 
1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
The team will be owned by Milan Mandaric, a San Jose businessman, and its 
roster is expected to include several players who either grew up in St. Louis 
or played with the Steamers. Former Steamers scheduled to join the team are 
midfielder Darryl Doran, defenders Steve Trittschuh and Mark Frederickson and 
goaltender Slobo Ilijevski. 
</P>
<P>
Doran and Frederickson were selected in the league's dispersal draft of players 
from the Los Angeles Lazers, which ceased operations last month.

NEWSWIRE: RUSSELL WHITE INELIGIBLE AT CAL THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Russell White, who will be a freshman this fall at the University of 
California, will not participate in football during the coming academic year 
because he failed to meet the minimum Scholastic Aptitude test score of 700 
required by the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
</P>
<P>
White, who is the nephew of former Ram running back Charles White, said 
Thursday that he will concentrate on his studies at Berkeley and return to the 
football program as a sophomore with three years of eligibility remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed that I will not be able to play this season, but I came here 
to Cal to get a good education and this gives me a chance to focus on my 
academics the first year," White said.

BIRDIE ON LAST HOLE GIVES KING LEAD IN WOMEN'S OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
Betsy King, the hottest golfer on the Ladies Professional Golf Assn. tour, shot 
a four-under-par 67 Thursday to take a one-stroke lead over Marie-Laure de 
Lorenzi-Taya in the first round of the $450,000 U.S. Women's Open golf 
championship at Lake Orion, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
King, who leads the LPGA money list with $423,794 and has won four tournaments 
this year, rolled in a 20-foot birdie putt from above the hole on the huge 18th 
green of the Old Course at Indianwood Golf and Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
De Lorenzi-Taya, 28, a native of France who lives in Barcelona, Spain, also 
birdied the final hole, making an eight-footer from below the hole on the 
22,000-square foot green. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Geddes, who won the Open in 1986, was the only other golfer in the field 
of 156 to break par. Geddes, playing in the morning before a stiff afternoon 
wind came up, shot a 70. 
</P>
<P>
De Lorenzi-Taya, who qualified for the U.S. Women's Amateur three times, is 
playing in the United States as a professional for only the third time and is 
making her Open debut. 
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Liselotte Neumann of Sweden, one of more than a dozen 
golfers at par, sprayed the ball both right and left but made up for it by 
putting only 25 times. 
</P>
<P>
Two golfers bidding for their first Open victory -- Nancy Lopez and Patty 
Sheehan -- shot a 73 and a 74, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Hal Sutton, trying to regain the form that brought him seven victories in his 
first five years on the PGA Tour, shot a seven-under-par 64 that tied him with 
Tim Simpson for the first-round lead in the Anheuser-Busch tournament at 
Williamsburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton, who hasn't won since 1986, and Simpson, who has led this tournament 
three times but has never won, were one shot off the course record at the 
6,776-yard Kingsmill Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton, who played in the morning, and Simpson, who began his round in the 
early afternoon, shared a one-shot advantage over Tim Norris, Chris Perry and 
Mike Hulbert. 
</P>
<P>
Another stroke back were Fuzzy Zoeller and Australian Ian Baker-Finch. 
</P>
<P>
Naomichi (Joe) Ozaki birdied the last hole and tied Ian Woosnam for the 
second-round lead in the Scottish Open at Gleneagles, Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
Ozaki, 33, winner of three tournaments in Japan earlier this year, did not make 
a bogey in a four-under-par 67 and completed 36 holes in 135. Woosnam, the 
first-round leader at 65, could do no better than a 70 that dropped him into a 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
A stroke back was Sandy Lyle, the former British Open and Masters champion, who 
shot a 66.

UCLA VOLLEYBALL TEAM REPRIMANDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UCLA was reprimanded by the Pacific 10 Conference because it used an ineligible 
volleyball player during intercollegiate men's matches last fall, Commissioner 
Thomas Hansen announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Kent Steffes, a transfer from Stanford, played in several two-man professional 
beach volleyball tournaments last summer, for which his playing partners 
received prize money, a violation of National Collegiate Athletic Assn. rules. 
</P>
<P>
One of his partners who received money was Wally Martin, a UCLA assistant coach 
who, according to a statement released by the Pac-10, was reprimanded and 
placed on probation by UCLA administrators. The statement said Martin was told 
that any future serious violation of NCAA rules would result in his 
termination. 
</P>
<P>
According to results published in Volleyball Monthly, Steffes and Martin played 
together in several tournaments, including one in Orange County and another in 
Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Steffes, who is listed in the UCLA media guide as the 1988 beach volleyball 
rookie of the year, was declared ineligible before the regular men's volleyball 
season last spring, so UCLA's NCAA championship was not affected. JERRY CROWE

EX-TROJAN PEETE IS 'SIGNED, SEALED AND DELIVERED' IN DETROIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AP

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DETROIT 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rodney Peete, opting for professional football over baseball, signed a 
multi-year contract Thursday with the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the agreement with the former USC quarterback, Detroit's sixth-round 
draft choice, were not disclosed, but it was reported to be a two-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Peete will join the Lions' voluntary passing camp Saturday at Oakland 
University in suburban Rochester, Mich. Regular training camp begins July 20. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm signed, sealed and delivered," Peete said during an interview at the 
Pontiac Silverdome, where he signed with the Lions Thursday afternoon, shortly 
after arriving in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a tough decision," he said. "I've loved baseball a long time and played 
it a long time. But football is where my heart is." 
</P>
<P>
Peete was runner-up to Oklahoma State running back Barry Sanders, the Lions' 
top draft choice and No. 3 overall pick in the NFL draft, in last season's 
Heisman Trophy voting. Peete also was an All-American and the Pacific 10 
Conference's offensive player of the year in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Peete was the Oakland Athletics' 13th-round selection in the baseball amateur 
draft. He said earlier that he was considering reporting to Oakland's Class A 
farm club in Medford, Ore., if he couldn't reach a contract agreement with the 
Lions. 
</P>
<P>
Peete set a deadline of Wednesday for deciding between football and baseball. 
The Lions waited until Wednesday before offering him the contract he signed the 
following day. 
</P>
<P>
"In June, baseball was pursuing me, and football wasn't," Peete said. "As for 
right now, I'm a Detroit Lion . . . and I'm not thinking about baseball at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
Peete completed 61.5% of his passes in 1988 for 2,654 yards and 18 touchdowns 
with the Trojans, who lost to Michigan, 22-14, in the Rose Bowl last Jan. 2. 
USC also lost to Michigan State in the Rose Bowl a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
He finished college with 630 completions in 1,081 attempts for 8,225 yards, all 
school records. 
</P>
<P>
Peete said he was looking forward to Detroit's option-laden run-and-shoot 
offense, designed in part to add spark to what was the National Football 
League's worst offense in 1988. Detroit was 4-12 last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I'll have any trouble fitting in," Peete said. "I'm very excited 
about it. As a quarterback, you love to throw the football and under this 
(offense), you obviously do." 
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, the Lions signed Jerry Woods and Chris Parker, their respective 
seventh- and eighth-round draft choices. 
</P>
<P>
Woods, a defensive back and kick-returner from Northern Michigan, was a 
two-time Little All-American. Parker, a 6-foot-5, 285-pound defensive lineman 
from West Virginia, was a second-team All-American in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Lions signed their 12th-round pick, James Cribbs, a 6-3, 269-pound 
defensive end from Memphis State.

ROBBINS, RAMS' ROOKIE TACKLE, JUST A SHADOW OF MANDARICH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Can you image anything more unnerving than playing opposite tackle to Tony 
Mandarich in college? Asking Zsa Zsa Gabor to step out of the car, maybe? 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to gather newspaper headlines when your former tackle partner at 
Michigan State on any given day is (a) ravaging through supermarket aisles with 
his now-famous Neanderthal-man hunger and shopping list, (b) challenging the 
heavyweight champion of the world to a fist fight or (c) holding the Green Bay 
Packers financial hostage. 
</P>
<P>
Mandarich makes sure everyone knows what Tony Mandarich is all about, 
especially when it's all about money. But the Michigan State All-American and 
first-round pick of the Packers is touted as the most menacing lineman to 
emerge since Anthony Munoz. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Robbins is not. Robbins is but a third-round draft pick of the Rams, one 
who will be fighting for the team's eighth offensive lineman position. But 
Robbins does share a bond with Mandarich, having played right tackle at 
Michigan State last season. Robbins even made honorable-mention All-American, 
though hardly anyone mentions it. 
</P>
<P>
He will forever be cast in the long shadow of Mandarich. And get this: it 
doesn't bother Robbins. He's not jealous. In fact, he says you can't buy the 
kind of publicity Mandarich brought to others at Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
"I encouraged him," Robbins said of Mandarich after his first morning workout 
with the Rams. "He helped me get where I'm at because of all the publicity. He 
brought a lot of publicity to the whole line." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins didn't mind being leftovers to the hundred or so scouts who paraded 
through Lansing last season to catch a load of Mandarich. Seems a few caught a 
glimpse of Robbins, too. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have to give it my all, and everything will fall into place, " Robbins 
said, "just like in college." 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, who at 286 pounds is a good 30 pounds lighter than Mandarich, says 
it's hard not to admire the All-American, despite his antics. 
</P>
<P>
"Even at Michigan State, he was the one," Robbins said. "When he had his mind 
set on something he did it." 
</P>
<P>
And what of this proposed fight with Mike Tyson? Robbins actually thinks 
Mandarich could go the distance. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he could step in the ring and collect afterwards," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Enough talk of Mandarich. It's time for Robbins to get to work. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pretty much ready to get out of Lansing," he said. "It was hot, humid 
and boring." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The team signed seventh-round pick George Bethune, a linebacker from Alabama, 
bringing to five the number of draft choices in camp. Ram coaches expected 
fifth-round cornerback Alfred Jackson for Thursday's afternoon practice, but 
his signing was held up. . . . Camp expands beyond rookies today as selected 
young veterans report, including tailback Gaston Green and receiver Aaron Cox.

SECOND HALF WILL TELL IF ORIOLES ARE REBUILDING OR BUILT FOR LONG HAUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KURKJIAN, The Baltimore Sun 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sparky Anderson, the manager of the Detroit Tigers, has had the Baltimore 
Orioles pegged for the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted their demise in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
He said he wasn't surprised by their 54-107 record in 1988, saying, "Teams 
usually play as well as their record shows." 
</P>
<P>
He said last summer that the Orioles had to rebuild immediately, which they 
did. Then, he applauded the unloading of veterans and going with kids. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Anderson is sure again. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll be in it in September," said Anderson, a manager who understands 
pennant races. "I know it. I like that team. They play hard. They've done 
everything right." 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles did indeed do everything right the first half of this season, a 
magical 85 games that have them leading the American League East Division by 5 
1/2 games and leading many baseball men, not just Anderson, to believe that the 
Orioles might be in the race until the end. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are those who believe it's a crawl, not a race, given the 
Orioles are the only East team with a winning record, but that is irrelevant. 
The idea is to win, whether it's with 81, 91 or 101 victories. 
</P>
<P>
"How can you not believe they'll be in it?" said Milwaukee Manager Tom 
Trebelhorn. "They're a good club." 
</P>
<P>
There are 77 games to go, but the Orioles' fate in the second half might rest 
in their next 21 games. Thursday night at Memorial Stadium, they begin a 
four-game series against the pitching-rich California Angels, who not only have 
the best record in the major leagues, but also have won eight of their last 10 
overall, and have a winning record this year (5-3) against the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Following the Angels, the Seattle Mariners come to town for three games. They 
have won 10 of their last 13, and have a winning record (5-4) against the 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Following the seven-game home stand, the Orioles play 14 games in 14 days in 
four cities and three time zones: Oakland, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Boston. It 
might be a killer trip. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no easy teams for us; no teams are taking us lightly. There are no 
easy series from here," said first baseman Randy Milligan. "Everyone in the 
West is tough. It's a long season. We've surprised some people, but now they've 
seen everything we've got." 
</P>
<P>
To some, what the Orioles have is impressive. 
</P>
<P>
"They are maybe the only team in this league that plays team ball," said 
Toronto catcher Bob Brenly, a career National Leaguer until this season. "They 
do all the little things to win: bunting, hitting-and-running, stealing, moving 
runners along. Almost every other team in this league just plays a glorified 
home run derby. That's one reason the Orioles will stay in it." 
</P>
<P>
There's a very good chance that the Orioles will attempt to make a trade for 
the second half. Almost every team involved in a pennant race tries to add a 
player, usually a veteran, for the stretch run. The Orioles have provided such 
veterans for other teams -- Mike Flanagan, Mike Boddicker, Jim Dwyer and others 
-- over the last couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Orioles might want help. 
</P>
<P>
It has been mentioned more than once in the last few weeks that the Tigers and 
Chicago White Sox might unload a veteran for the stretch in hope of acquiring a 
young player. The name of White Sox outfielder-designated hitter Harold Baines 
has come up more than once in the last month, but apparently the White Sox are 
not ready to deal. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of acquiring Baines seems to intrigue Manager Frank Robinson, but one 
of his players said, "I think we need another pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the availability of Detroit's Doyle Alexander, a free agent after 
this season, Robinson said, "He might not be around." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said he and General Manager Roland Hemond met two weeks ago to discuss 
trades, and said they would meet again at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
Hemond said, "You know me, I'm never afraid to make a trade. But we'll have to 
see if it can help us." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson said, "We won't trade just to make a trade. If we get someone, it's 
because we really want him." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson has said many times, "If it's not broke, don't fix it." He has said 
that he's reluctant to mess with the chemistry of this team. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a long way to go and a lot of baseball to be played, but I really 
don't believe we're the type of team likely to run into a serious slump," 
Robinson said. "We have too much good going for us right now." 
</P>
<P>
Can the good things keep happening? 
</P>
<P>
History says no. No team in major-league history has gone from last one year to 
first the next. 
</P>
<P>
History says maybe. No American League East team since the 1978 Boston Red Sox 
has led by at least 3 1/2 games on July 4 -- the Orioles' lead was 6 1/2 -- and 
not won the division. Plus, of the 80 teams who have won division titles 
starting with 1969, 51 teams (64 percent) were leading at the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics say no. There was no way anyone could have predicted that catcher 
Mickey Tettleton -- who hadn't hit more than 11 homers on any level before this 
year -- could have 20 homers at the All-Star break. Or that Jeff Ballard, a 
lifetime 10-20 pitcher in the majors before this season, would be 10-4. Or that 
reliever Gregg Olson, less than a year removed from college, would be 3-0 with 
a 1.89 ERA and 14 saves in 14 tries. Or that Jay Tibbs, a career 31-47 pitcher 
in the majors before this year, would be 5-0. Or that Kevin Hickey, who had not 
played in the big leagues since 1983, would own Wade Boggs, Don Mattingly, 
George Brett and others. 
</P>
<P>
Those guys might have to continue their career years if the Orioles are to win. 
The team also must straighten out its starting rotation, which has been shaky. 
Rookie Bob Milacki must rediscover his changeup. The Orioles also must get a 
lot more out of Larry Sheets and Brady Anderson in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Statistics can lie. How can you figure that the Orioles have been outhit, 
.271-.261, in the first half, yet have outscored opponents, 398-342? "Sometimes 
it's easy to figure out why a team is losing," said Milligan. "It's tougher to 
figure out why they're winning." 
</P>
<P>
The Orioles are winning because they lead the league in extra-base hits (tied 
for third in homers), walks, fewest walks allowed, most sacrifices (37; the 
last four years, they have averaged 34 for the season) and fewest errors. They 
might be the only American League East team that doesn't beat itself. Despite a 
lineup that doesn't look overly menacing, the Orioles have averaged 4.68 runs 
per game, the second-best ratio in the major leagues to the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
"They're a very heavy-handed coached team," said Blue Jays pitcher Mike 
Flanagan. "I'm sure none of them has the green light (on the bases)." They 
don't. "I'm sure they all go up there looking to bunt, to take. They're running 
out everything. They don't swing at bad pitches, they throw strikes. They do 
everything they can to score first, try to stay ahead until the sixth or 
seventh, then hang on. But they've hung on so far. I think they can keep it 
up." 
</P>
<P>
Inexperience says they're not ready. Shortstop Cal Ripken is the only player 
remaining from the 1983 World Series winners, and only four of the players on 
the 24-man roster have played in a postseason game. The Orioles were the 
youngest team in the major leagues at the start of the season. One American 
League player, who asked not to be named, said, "How are those young guys going 
to react with 40,000 fans screaming in their ears in September? Even veterans 
get pretty tight when it gets hairy towards the end." 
</P>
<P>
"What makes you optimistic about this club is that they're young," said Ripken. 
"There's a good chance that they're going to get better. In spring training and 
early in the season, you say, 'Gosh, they have a lot of talent.' Enthusiasm is 
very easy when you're young. The dive-for-everything, run-through-the-wall 
mentality, that's contagious. The only need was experience. We've had a good 
half, but there's a chance, a good chance, that it's going to continue because 
we have players who are going to get better." 
</P>
<P>
Still, with youth, and with the Orioles' gruesome history of the last couple of 
years, some baseball people feel the Orioles will collapse. 
</P>
<P>
"They've said that all year," said Orioles first baseman Jim Traber. "And 
they'll be saying that in September." 
</P>
<P>
Others say the first big losing streak might bury the Orioles. Or that the 
All-Star break will cause them to lose momentum. 
</P>
<P>
"Lose our momentum? No, I don't think so," said Robinson. "That's not a 
concern. I don't place much stock in the usual thoughts about the All-Star 
break. I mean, if a team loses a few afterward, people they say lost their 
momentum. If the same team happens to win a few, the same people will say they 
picked up right where they left off or the time off really refreshed them. In 
other words, it can mean anything you want." 
</P>
<P>
So, he isn't thinking pennant yet? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even think about that," Robinson said. "There are a lot of games to 
play. The magic number is too high. When we're seven games ahead with six to 
play, I'll be thinking about the pennant. For now, just do the job at hand." 
</P>
<P>
It's a job Anderson has had many times -- and a job Anderson would want now. 
</P>
<P>
"It will all come down to how the Orioles' pitching holds up the last two 
months," said Anderson. "If it does, they'll win. If it doesn't, Boston, New 
York or Toronto will beat them. But I like being ahead of everyone. I like 
people chasing me." 
</P>
<P>
Thursday night, the chase resumed.

BID FOR WARNER IS MUDDIED BY CHRIS-CRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an 11th-hour move, Warner Communications' largest shareholder launched three 
legal actions in New York and Delaware courts that could delay Time Inc.'s cash 
tender offer for Warner due to expire Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Chris-Craft Industries, a large and dissident shareholder since 1984, owns 17% 
of Warner shares worth $1.7 billion under the terms of Time's $70-per-share 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
Chris-Craft's legal action is regarded as a sideshow to Time and Warner's 
battle in Delaware Chancery Court, where their deal has been challenged by 
Paramount Communications Inc. Time recently rebuffed a takeover bid from 
Paramount worth $200 per share. 
</P>
<P>
The Delaware decision is expected today, and Chris-Craft has asked for the 
chance to intervene if the court orders a stay, or temporary halt, to Time's 
tender offer. Essentially, Chris-Craft said it will urge the court to require 
Time to extend its offer instead of allowing it to accept shares without paying 
promptly. That petition could affect all Warner shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
Chris-Craft is in a unique quandary, however, because most of its Warner shares 
are preferred stock, which must be converted to common if Chris-Craft wants to 
participate in the tender offer. 
</P>
<P>
Time intends to complete the tender in two stages, promising cash for only half 
of Warner's shares. Since the cash offer is expected to be oversubscribed, 
Chris-Craft is protesting that it is being coerced into converting its shares 
and giving up its preferred shareholder rights, in effect getting stuck with 
common. Although Time has promised to acquire the remaining Warner shares, it 
has not disclosed its formula of cash, stock or debt valued at $70 a share. 
</P>
<P>
To address that problem, Chris-Craft on Thursday asked a New York trial court 
to force Time to accept its preferred shares without going through the 
conversion. After hearing arguments, the judge put off the matter until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Chris-Craft asked the Delaware court to clarify its rights under a 
settlement reached with Warner and Time in May regarding the fate of a 
broadcasting unit co-owned with Warner. The settlement would have given 
Chris-Craft 62.1% after a spinoff of Warner's stake to Time-Warner 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the settlement, Time and Warner were planning a stock swap that 
has been abandoned in favor of Time's $14-billion acquisition of Warner. Now 
Time and Warner no longer think that Chris-Craft is entitled to the full 62.1%, 
court filings indicate.

TRADERS' OPTIMISM NUDGES DOW UP 5.69

<DATELINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stock prices posted their eighth straight gain Thursday as traders waited 
hopefully for new signs of a slowing economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, which closed Wednesday at a new 
post-crash high, rose 5.69 to 2,538.32. 
</P>
<P>
That extended the index's gain so far this month to 98.26, leaving it about 184 
points short of the record close of 2,722.42 reached Aug. 25, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading of 
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks. 
</P>
<P>
Big Board volume totaled 153.80 million shares, down from 160.55 million 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts said traders were looking ahead optimistically to several economic 
reports due from the government today, including monthly statistics on 
industrial production and the producer price index of finished goods. 
</P>
<P>
The figures are expected to provide further confirmation that economic growth 
is slowing, fulfilling a primary goal of the Federal Reserve's credit policy. 
</P>
<P>
Investors were likely to give especially close scrutiny to the report on 
producer prices which, if it lives up to its advance billing, will show a 
slackening of inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates on Wall Street call for the index to be up about 0.3% for June, 
compared to a 0.9% jump the month before. 
</P>
<P>
As had happened Wednesday, the market encountered some mild selling in the 
first half of the session but then resumed its advance in afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
Honeywell, widely discussed of late as a possible takeover candidate, jumped 6 
1/2 to 86. 
</P>
<P>
Other gainers among the blue chips included Eastman Kodak, up 1 3/8 at 48 3/4; 
Walt Disney, up 7/8 at 99 3/4; Union Carbide, up 3/4 at 27 7/8, and General 
Motors, up 3/8 at 42. GM shares got a boost from better-than-expected domestic 
car sales for early July. 
</P>
<P>
Westinghouse Electric rose 1 to 65 1/4. The company reported second-quarter 
earnings of $1.56 a share, up from $1.47 a share in the comparable period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices closed lower in dull trading, pushed 
down in the afternoon by futures-related selling. The key Nikkei index eased 
70.36 to close at 33,631.16. Share prices rose slightly on the London stock 
exchange in tentative, volatile trading. The Financial Times 100-share index 
rose 1.3 to close at 2,258.0. 
</P>
<P>
Credit 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices dipped slightly as traders awaited today's economic reports. 
</P>
<P>
The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 7/32 point, or about $2.18 per 
$1,000 face amount. Its yield edged up to 8.04% from 8.03% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, traded 
at 9.313%, unchanged from late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Currency 
</P>
<P>
The dollar moved mostly higher against major foreign currencies in choppy 
trading before today's potentially market-moving economic reports. 
</P>
<P>
Gold prices declined. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for 
current delivery fell $1.70 to $377 an ounce. Republic National Bank of New 
York quoted a late bid of $375.50, down from Wednesday's late bid of $377.40. 
</P>
<P>
Activity in the foreign exchange markets featured dealers adjusting their 
holdings in anticipation of the economic reports. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people feel the statistics will be pointing to a weaker economy and 
hence a weaker dollar," said Bob Morrissey, a trader in the Bank of Boston's 
New York office. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this perception, the dollar finished higher against most currencies 
except the Japanese yen. The dollar's strength was a byproduct of dealers' 
desires to lighten their holdings of West German marks, mainly so they could 
buy more yen. 
</P>
<P>
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 139.05 Japanese yen from 140.50 late Wednesday. In 
London late Thursday, the dollar traded higher at 139.20, and in New York, the 
dollar ended at 139.45 yen, down from 139.60 yen Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
In London, one British pound closed at $1.6240, cheaper for buyers than 
Wednesday's late level of $1.6255. Sterling fetched $1.6205 in New York, 
compared to $1.6300 on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Commodities 
</P>
<P>
Prices of soybean futures rebounded on the Chicago Board of Trade after news of 
a legal challenge to the exchange's order that traders liquidate their holdings 
in the July soybean contract. 
</P>
<P>
Wheat and oat futures also advanced, while corn futures finished mixed. 
</P>
<P>
On other markets, sugar futures soared amid rumors of Soviet buying, cattle 
futures were up sharply, pork futures were mixed, energy futures advanced and 
precious metals were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Soybeans settled 10 cents to 17.5 cents higher, with the contract for delivery 
in July up 11 cents at $6.975 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
Two subsidiaries of Italian agribusiness giant Ferruzzi Finanziara S.p.A. filed 
a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Chicago seeking an injunction against the 
Board of Trade's emergency directive. 
</P>
<P>
The exchange's order, issued Tuesday, was widely seen as an attempt to block an 
attempt by Ferruzzi to control the soybean market. 
</P>
<P>
Soybeans had opened strongly higher on Wednesday's government report of 
smaller-than-expected soybean plantings, but the market had eased by midday on 
profit taking. Wire service reports of Ferruzzi's lawsuit appeared at about 1 
p.m. CDT.

Asbestos Suit Filed: Lawyers seeking to represent more than 80,000 people filed 
suit against the investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and leveraged 
buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. seeking to reverse the 
$2.4-billion takeover of Jim Walter Corp. two years ago. The lawsuit, filed in 
Texas state court in Beaumont, claims that the buyout was a fraudulent attempt 
to escape more than $3 billion in liabilities stemming from asbestos claims 
against Celotex Corp., a subsidiary of Tampa, Fla.-based home builder Jim 
Walter, also named as a defendant.

Housing Completions Fall: The Commerce Department reported that the number of 
new American homes and apartment buildings completed during May fell by 7.5% to 
the lowest level in six months. The May drop, following a revised 6.4% rise in 
April, was down 1.7% from a year ago. May housing completions stood at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.436 million, the lowest since November, 
1988, when the rate was 1.429 million. Aside from the steep fall in the 
Northeast, home completions fell 7.4% in the Midwest, 5.3% in the South and 
2.6% in the West.

Vestron Misses Payment: Vestron Inc. said it will consider a merger or sale of 
all or part of the company. Best known as a videocassette company, Vestron 
scored a hit in the movie business with "Dirty Dancing" but last week missed a 
payment on a $25-million note owed to Wells Fargo Bank. The Connecticut-based

financial advisers to continue trying to raise money or find a purchaser for 
"The Video Store," its retail video operations.

Drained Underground Bank Closes: Taiwan's biggest underground bank, drained of 
cash after a run on its deposits, has closed its doors. Economists said the 
decision by the Hung Yuan group to suspend cash withdrawals could signal the 
end of the island's underground banking system that once offered instant 
fortunes to millions of Taiwanese. Most of Taiwan's estimated 200 unlicensed 
investment firms are refusing to hand out money after Parliamentpassed a 
revised banking law Tuesday that aims to crack down on their operations.

CENTRAL DIAGNOSTIC LAB TO SELL WESTERN UNIT FOR $85 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGORY CROUCH, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Orange County medical firm has agreed to buy the western operations of 
Central Diagnostic Laboratory, the sister firm of a Pap smear lab closed this 
year by the state for misdiagnosing too many tests. 
</P>
<P>
MetWest Inc. in Newport Beach agreed to pay $85 million for Central 
Diagnostic's operations. Industry consultants said it is one of the highest 
prices paid for a private lab. In addition, Central Diagnostic has tentatively 
agreed to sell its Midwest and East operations to New Jersey lab giant MetPath 
for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
If the deal goes through, MetWest says it will be the sixth-largest lab chain 
in the country. "We want to be the premier lab in the West," said David Bush, 
MetWest's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
Tarzana-based Central Diagnostic, which performs tests including blood and 
urine analyses, is owned by Dr. Allen N. Levy. The 62-year old pathologist also 
owned Central Pathology Services Medical Group, which was closed by the state 
Department of Health Services in April after an inspection found that the Pap 
smear lab had a 21% error rate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Name Will Probably Change 
</P>
<P>
Pap smears are routine tests used to detect cervical cancer and certain other 
gynecological abnormalities. Central Pathology processed more than half of all 
smears taken in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Because Central Pathology also did business under the name Central Diagnostic 
Laboratory and had the same owner, Central Diagnostic's revenue fell by about 
10% after the shutdown and has not recovered, said Central Diagnostic spokesman 
Martin Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said MetWest wasn't concerned about the controversy, but he added that the 
firm probably will change its name. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me be very explicit," Bush said. "We are not buying any of the operations 
that had a problem with the state. We are not assuming any of those 
liabilities." 
</P>
<P>
MetWest is buying the assets of Central Diagnostic's western operations, but is 
not acquiring the company's stock. Thus, Bush said, it will not be responsible 
for any of Central Diagnostic's liabilities, including a $9-million judgment 
awarded to a former employee. 
</P>
<P>
MetWest was formed last August after MetPath spun off its western operations. 
Unilab Corp., a publicly traded medical firm in Georgia, later bought MetWest. 
MetPath owns 20% of Unilab.

Some FM Stations Can Boost Signals: The Federal Communications Commission has 
approved new rules that will allow thousands of FM stations serving small 
communities to double their signal strengths and reach larger audiences. The 
commission, in a 3-0 vote, said so-called Class A FM stations could boost their 
power from the present limit of 3,000 watts up to 6,000 watts. The commission 
also revised the distances by which Class A stations must be separated from 
other stations to limit interference. Existing stations that do not meet the 
revised separation requirements will be "grandfathered," and will be allowed to 
move their antennas or request permission to use directional antennas.

PEOPLE: NEW YORK MERC HEAD RESIGNS IN REORGANIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rosemary T. McFadden, president of the New York Mercantile Exchange, has 
resigned as part of a reorganization of the world's largest oil futures 
exchange. She will remain an adviser to the exchange. 
</P>
<P>
McFadden, a 39-year-old lawyer and major figure in the futures industry, helped 
steer NYMEX through a period of rapid growth, changing it from a sleepy 
agricultural commodity exchange into a world futures powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
She was able to negotiate a cash severance package of more than $500,000, 
according to a source familiar with the deal. 
</P>
<P>
NYMEX Chairman Z. Lou Guttman said that McFadden's resignation, effective July 
31, is part of a restructuring plan that will allow the exchange to better 
divide administrative responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
He said McFadden had been trying to handle the exchange's internal and external 
affairs and that the NYMEX board felt she had become "overloaded" with work. 
"The job had become too big for one person to handle," Guttman said. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement, McFadden said, "It has been a rewarding and fulfilling 
experience to serve the exchange. The NYMEX Board feels I can better serve the 
exchange in my new strategic advisory capacity. I look forward to this 
opportunity." McFadden was not available for further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Her resignation, which was unexpected, comes at a time when NYMEX faces several 
public relations problems. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, federal investigators went to the exchange's offices in 
Manhattan to gather records as part of an investigation into suspected trading 
abuses. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the exchange is under pressure from some members to modify the 
delivery terms of its crude oil contract, and to decide how it will participate 
in after-hours trading, a trend that is sweeping world markets. 
</P>
<P>
R.P. Thompson, now executive vice president of NYMEX, will serve as interim 
president, managing internal affairs, until a replacement is found. Thompson is 
considered by some exchange sources as a likely candidate to succeed McFadden.

CONFEREES STALL OVER AGENDA ON MEASURE TO BAIL OUT S&amp;LS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The congressional conference to prepare a massive savings and loan industry 
rescue bill bogged down in confusion and acrimony Thursday as House and Senate 
members disagreed on procedures. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate negotiators, in a surprise move, offered a package deal but were 
quickly rebuffed by House members, who want to discuss and resolve each issue 
separately. 
</P>
<P>
The differing approaches reflect the numbers involved: There are just eight 
Senate conferees, with five handling most of the bill. The House, by contrast, 
has 94 participants divided into "platoons" dealing with different issues. 
</P>
<P>
The original agenda called for the conferees to spend Thursday dealing with the 
two biggest issues of the legislation: the proposed tough new financial 
standards for S&amp;Ls and whether to include the full cost of the bailout in 
the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stringent Capital Requirement 
</P>
<P>
After meeting separately earlier Thursday, the key Senate conferees assembled a 
package proposal calling for tight capital rules and accepting a House 
provision that would require S&amp;L owners to furnish $3 of their own cash for 
every $100 in loans made by the institution. 
</P>
<P>
This indicated their willingness to go beyond the bill that was passed by the 
Senate -- and even to surpass the stricter House version -- by forcing the 3% 
standard into effect immediately on passage of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Senate negotiators' package plan also calls for keeping the 
financing of the S&amp;L rescue, estimated at nearly $300 billion over 30 
years, off the federal budget through a special bond issue. The bill passed by 
the House would require the cost of the bailout to be on the budget. 
</P>
<P>
The senators' willingness to accept a more stringent capital requirement for 
S&amp;Ls, as well as to accept the House view of some other issues, did not 
impress the House members. 
</P>
<P>
House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D-Tex.), clearly miffed by the 
senators' surprise move, called the proposed package "raw and undefined." Its 
sudden presentation "is a horrendous injustice to House conferees," Gonzalez 
said after the legislators had been wrangling for several hours without 
resolving a single issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I am deeply disappointed we have wasted so much time when we could have 
cleared out the capital issue," Gonzalez said. "For us to be stalled by the 
Senate conferees . . . is quite unfair." 
</P>
<P>
The leader of the Senate contingent, Banking Committee Chairman Donald W. 
Riegle Jr. (D-Mich)., said the Senate proposal included "as many of the key 
House provisions as we can. In many areas we are very close together." He 
expressed hope that the House would consider the Senate plan and respond 
quickly, enabling the conference to complete its work early next week. 
</P>
<P>
The ranking Republican senator, Jake Garn of Utah, also appealed for a quick 
response. "We can't hold the package together that we hammered out with each 
other unless it is responded to by the House," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Gonzalez and his House colleagues were adamant that the conference should 
continue with its original agenda, dealing with capital standards and the 
budget financing issue, on a discrete basis, rather than trying for a broad 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
The Senate plan "is very vague and undefined," Gonzalez said. "It is so broad 
and general it doesn't contain any real offer we could entertain." 
</P>
<P>
With S&amp;L losses continuing to mount at a rate of $500 million to $1 billion 
a month, the goal of the conference is to send a bill to President Bush before 
the end of the month. The legislation would provide funds to close hundreds of 
insolvent thrift institutions and pay off their customers, whose deposits of up 
to $100,000 are guaranteed by federal insurance.

PEOPLE: ROCKWELL NAMES TRIO TO MANAGE ITS DIVISIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rockwell International has appointed three executives as chief operating 
officers of the diversified firm's business segments and has eliminated the 
office of president. 
</P>
<P>
Kent M. Black, Sam F. Iacobellis and J. Tracy O'Rourke were elected by the 
board to new jobs as executive vice presidents and chief operating officers. 
Donald R. Beall, chairman and chief executive of El Segundo-based Rockwell, 
gave up his additional title of president. 
</P>
<P>
Beall said in an interview Thursday that the new corporate organization "is 
something I have planned for years and years, and it was discussed with the 
board even before I became chairman." 
</P>
<P>
Beall added that he does not consider the three executive vice presidents to be 
in a "horse race" for the presidency of the company, noting that the 
corporation's bylaws were amended Wednesday to eliminate the office of 
president. 
</P>
<P>
"This approach is the way a diverse company should be run," Beall said. "This 
is the way General Electric, IBM, Xerox, Union Carbide and Eastman Kodak, among 
other companies with diverse operations, have chosen to operate." 
</P>
<P>
The realignment does not substantially change the responsibilities that have 
been held by Black, Iacobellis and O'Rourke, but it does formalize an operating 
structure that has been in effect for about a year and a half, Beall said. 
</P>
<P>
The three executives are not members of Rockwell's board, and Beall declined to 
discuss whether they would be elected at a future time. The only company 
executives now on the board are Beall and Robert A. de Palma, who is Rockwell's 
chief financial officer. The fact that De Palma holds a seat on the board 
appears inconsistent with the current management organization, but he has long 
served as a director. 
</P>
<P>
Black will be responsible for Rockwell's Autonetics operation in Anaheim, 
automotive unit in Michigan and an avionics and communications unit in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Iacobellis will run the firm's California aerospace and defense operations, 
including North American Aircraft in El Segundo, Rocketdyne in Canoga Park, 
satellites division in Seal Beach and the Rocky Flats operation in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
O'Rourke will have the Allen-Bradley factory controls operation in Wisconsin, 
graphic systems in Illinois and Rockwell Communications in Texas. RALPH

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: HEADHUNTERS CAN PREVENT HEADACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jane Applegate

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking for a way to improve the quality of the new managers joining his El 
Monte instrumentation firm, Steve Olson insisted that every prospective 
employee be interviewed and rated by five of his company's current supervisors. 
While this policy helped screen out some potential problems, Olson, then 
president and chief executive of Signet Scientific, eventually turned to a 
small executive recruiting firm for help. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's been money well spent," said Olson, who now heads a Seal Beach 
merchant banking firm bearing his name. And today, although he has fewer than a 
dozen employees, he still relies on the same recruiters to bring him the best 
people. 
</P>
<P>
When there are 250 people in an organization and you make a mistake in hiring, 
it doesn't make much difference, said Olson. "But, when you have five people in 
a company, the impact can be significant." 
</P>
<P>
Olson and others said many small-business owners are reluctant to bring in 
professionals to help them find managers, relying instead on personal contacts 
or advertising. Entrepreneurs resist the sales pitches of recruiters by saying 
they can't afford the fees or fear losing control over hiring. 
</P>
<P>
To a small business, spending $30,000 to find a new $100,000-a-year executive 
vice president may seem steep, but search consultants suggest that the fee be 
considered as an investment in the company's future. 
</P>
<P>
"Start-ups can't afford the wrong players," said Jay Berger, a principal in the 
Pasadena search firm of Cowen, Morris, Berger. "They need the right people to 
put together the dream." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Different Roles 
</P>
<P>
Berger said most business owners hire new managers on the basis of a gut 
feeling, "but if the person doesn't have the right skills, the chemistry will 
wear thin." 
</P>
<P>
He said business owners may be confused about the kinds of services an 
executive search firm provides. Unlike employment agencies, which charge fees 
to job seekers, search firms are paid by a company looking for middle- and 
upper-level employees. 
</P>
<P>
While some firms are beginning to offer flat fees, most search consultants 
charge between 25% and 33% of the salary being offered the prospective 
employee. They also bill the client for travel and out-of-pocket expenses, 
including telephone calls, mailings and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Finding the right kind of search firm for your business can be daunting. There 
are more than 1,200 companies nationwide, with 10 large firms dominating the 
industry. Small business owners are advised to seek out a smaller company that 
can give them the personal attention they need. 
</P>
<P>
A good recruiter will keep going for as long as it takes to find the right 
person. 
</P>
<P>
After nearly five years in the search business, Cowen, Morris, Berger has only 
given up on one search, according to partner Kristine Morris. That failure was 
in dealing with a family business where the husband and wife could not agree 
about what kind of person to hire. 
</P>
<P>
"They finally hired their son for the job," said Berger. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller search firms are also willing to adjust their fees and take risks when 
they believe in a client. 
</P>
<P>
Morris and Berger found the president for a newly organized high-technology 
firm. They accepted stock in the company as their fee instead of cash. But, the 
Silicon Valley company never got off the ground, leaving them with a worthless 
stock certificate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Create Job Description 
</P>
<P>
Company owners and recruiters said it is important to view the relationship as 
a partnership. The first thing a competent search firm does is learn as much as 
it can about your company and style of doing business. 
</P>
<P>
Next, recruiters should sit down and help managers create a clear job 
description for the position they are trying to fill. Then they should 
interview all the people who will work for or with the new employee. 
</P>
<P>
At some point in the relationship, they sit down with the management team to 
design a human resources strategy, listing exactly what kind of people are 
needed to meet the goals. 
</P>
<P>
"What evolves here is a partnership," said Gary Kaplan, a 10-year veteran of 
the search business who specializes in the entertainment and communication 
industries. "A search consultant becomes part of the company." 
</P>
<P>
Kaplan, who heads Gary Kaplan &amp; Associates in Pasadena, said his job is to 
"identify the best and the brightest" employees for his clients. 
</P>
<P>
Before hiring a search firm, Kaplan suggests asking for a list of their other 
clients. This is important because as a matter of policy search firms do not 
raid their own clients when they are looking for job candidates. This means 
that a large firm with hundreds of clients may find its hands tied because all 
those firms are considered off limits. 
</P>
<P>
Once the search consultant has all the information in hand, he or she usually 
launches a nationwide search for the best candidates, usually seeking out 
people working in similar jobs for competing firms. 
</P>
<P>
After reviewing resumes, candidates are initially interviewed by telephone. If 
they become serious contenders, the consultants meet with them in person. After 
the interviews, the client is usually given a detailed, written report about 
the job seeker. The finalists for each job meet the management and check out 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
Search consultants also check references and educational claims, because 
according to Morris, 85% of job applicants lie about some aspect of their 
educational background. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Course for CEOs Set for Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
The Management Course for Chief Executives, sponsored by the New York-based 
Center for Entrepreneurial Management, is scheduled for Aug. 7-9 at the 
Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Laguna Beach. The session includes intensive case 
studies, discussions and special seminars for spouses of "hard-driving CEOs." 
</P>
<P>
The cost, excluding hotel accommodations, is $1,250 for the chief executive who 
is a member of the Center for Entrepreneurial Management and $250 for spouses. 
Non-member CEOs pay $1,600 and spouses $350. For information call: (800)

U.S. Wants Suppliers for Japanese Mission 
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department is looking for manufacturers and suppliers of 
sportswear, leisure wear, camping equipment, boats and fashion jewelry to 
travel to Japan on a trade mission in September. 
</P>
<P>
Japan is the most lucrative market for U.S.-made sports and leisure products, 
according to a department spokesman. The California Lifestyle Matchmaker Trade 
Delegation will provide appointments and introductions for people who 
participate. Meetings with Japanese firms and business people will take place 
Sept. 23-30 in Tokyo and Osaka. The cost is about $4,000 per person. 
</P>
<P>
For additional information call Sherwin Chen or Allison Hirsch at the Commerce 
Department's Los Angeles District Office, (213) 209-6718; or fax in a request: 
(213) 209-6711. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HIRING A SEARCH FIRM 
</P>
<P>
If you are thinking about hiring a search firm, here are suggestions from 
business owners and consultants: 
</P>
<P>
 Find people you feel comfortable confiding in and working with. This is 
important because the search firm will represent you and your company to 
prospective employees. 
</P>
<P>
Find out exactly how much the search firm will charge for services. Insist on a 
careful explanation of charges and expenses so there will be no surprises. 
</P>
<P>
Ask who actually will do the search work for your firm. In many larger firms, 
the principals are out signing up new clients, leaving less experienced 
associates to find the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Find out if the company has worked for companies your size and in your field. 
Many search firms specialize in serving certain professions or industries. 
</P>
<P>
Ask for a list of clients and call them for information. Ask if the search firm 
was responsive. Find out if they brought in good candidates and how long it 
took to fill each job.

Hilton Hotels Corp.: The Beverly Hills-based hotel operator reported 
second-quarter profit of $42 million, up 3% over a year ago. Revenue totaled 
$265 million, up 6%. The results reflected a 14% gain in income due to improved 
results at facilities in New York, Chicago and Hawaii, which more than offset 
start-up losses from two full-service hotels and one all-suite hotel. Gaming 
income also edged up 2% to $36.8 million.

BEHIND THE WHEEL: AH, PORSCHE: GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To examine Porsche these days is to sense the sadness that comes with 
witnessing the mortality and descent of any oligarchy. 
</P>
<P>
The company continues to make sovereign sports cars: pedigreed, blueblooded and 
indestructible machines. A Porsche is still built to behave very quickly as a 
single system. Porsches show no slack, no noticeable transitions between the 
functions of braking, steering, accelerating and flattening a chassis against a 
road. They are among the best. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Porsche sales are face down in the mud. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the company sold a piddling 15,737 cars in the United States, a 
horrible 50% drop from its boom year of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The first half of this year is starting to look like the last half of the 
Lakers' championship finals. Porsche had sold only 3,600 vehicles by June 1, 
and at this pace, all public relations positivism to one side, 1989 could be 
Stuttgart-Zuffenhausen's first serious sight of Armageddon. 
</P>
<P>
The rock: Sharp depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Deutschmark has 
pushed Porsche's prices way above the competition and maybe even beyond the 
value the car once represented. 
</P>
<P>
The hard place: The Japanese -- and in some cases American manufacturers -- 
have been marketing cars with Porsche's performance numbers but at half the 
sticker prices. 
</P>
<P>
The final nail: Even Porsche's devout began buying elsewhere rather than 
investing in styling that to naked eyes and image shoppers really hasn't 
changed in more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
"January and February were almost frightening," a spokesman for Reno-based 
Porsche Cars North America said. "We also recognize that (this year) we are not 
going to be selling 30,000 or even 17,000 vehicles . . . but it (the current 
sales situation) is not something that is going to put the company out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to appear sanguine about it, but there are some bright spots." He 
said sales of the everlasting Porsche 911 with a silhouette that hasn't budged 
much since 1964, have started shifting upward. The entry-level 944 seems to be 
holding its own. "They're still not good figures but there does seem to be some 
life in the sports car market. We are doing things and hopefully there will be 
some results." 
</P>
<P>
What Porsche AG of West Germany is doing may best be seen as biting the bullet 
while swallowing most of the gunpowder. 
</P>
<P>
It has cut its West German work force. Next, it reduced and rearranged 
production of its 12-vehicle line. Porsche then executed the un-American and 
inconceivable -- it actually reduced prices on some models and by as much as 
$3,000. 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, throughout this corporate depression, Porsche hasn't introduced any 
really new cars because no company dedicated to quality and craftsmanship can 
move that fast in any pinch. 
</P>

<P>
Memories on Wheels 
</P>
<P>
So the Porsche Carrera 4 is a 911 with all-wheel drive. There's a soft, 
rounded-off Speedster geared to memories of the '50s and '60s but only 400 will 
be made. Porsche has improved this car, refreshed that one, added a cabriolet 
here and a turbocharged version there. 
</P>
<P>
Even the "new" Porsche 944S2 is simply a reinforcement of an existing series -- 
a bored-out version of last year's 16-valve 944S and a tacit admission that the 
earlier car just wasn't as tractable, nor as salable, as had been anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
Whether the 944S2 will be a stronger seller, given the current climate, remains 
moot. Clear, however, is the S2's improvement over its ancestors -- with that 
added endowment of a $3,000 price reduction. 
</P>
<P>
Redesigning the block, enlarging the cylinder bore and increasing the stroke 
gives the car 3.0 liters of displacement and 208 horsepower compared with the 
2.5 liters and 150 horsepower of last year's stock 944. This, Porsche says, 
makes it the most powerful, conventionally aspirated four-cylinder engine in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$15,000 Worth of Extras 
</P>
<P>
The S2 arrives with a checker's tape of standard equipment that, if it could be 
declined as options, might knock $15,000 off the sticker. The list includes 
alloy wheels, heated rear windows and mirrors, anti-lock brakes, driver and 
passenger air bags, sun roof, Blaupunkt radio, cruise control, power windows 
and steering, central locking, electrically adjusted mirrors . . . und aller 
dieser Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
On the road, the S2 is a free-revving, feisty prowler working fully to the 
standards that are a norm for Porsche, yet seem to be an impossibility for 
other manufacturers. The car is nimble in first with second gear hooked to an 
afterburner that's good to about 60 m.p.h. On the freeway, one can play around 
all day with third and fourth because the range there is from 60 to 125 m.p.h. 
In about 15 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
But it's the breadth and balance of the five-speed box, a feeling of always 
being in a gear appropriate to the pace, no matter our medium transgressions, 
that sets Porsche head and shoulders above the competition -- if below eye 
level in sales. 
</P>
<P>
Or is handling the superlative of a Porsche? 
</P>
<P>
In truth, the Porsche probably corners no flatter, no faster than other 
entrants in its 150 m.p.h. performance class. The steering reads no more, no 
less, and the suspension seems no stiffer, no softer. But the car feels 
infinitely superior and from that comes the blessing of increased driver 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Feeling of Safety 
</P>
<P>
Or as automotive photojournalist John Lamm once noted: He feels safer at 170 
m.p.h. in the Porsche 959 than he does at 55 m.p.h. in a Chevrolet Nova. 
</P>
<P>
It is a security created by much more than a motor and double overhead this and 
semi-trailing that. It has to do with establishing a driver's center of bottom 
closer to the gravel. And building expensive seats to hold him -- or her -- 
there. It's a matter of balancing a chassis. And chintzing on no unseen 
suspension attachment to maintain that symmetry. 
</P>
<P>
Then Porsche assembles this total driving system as though its own CEO's life, 
limb and comfort depend upon it. 
</P>
<P>
Our test car was a relative old-timer with almost 6,000 miles on it. By IMJ 
(International Motoring Journalist) standards, that's a thrashing roughly 
equivalent to eight Paris-Dakar rallies. That would explain a broken lock on a 
console box, a hatchback catch that often didn't and glitchy door locks. 
</P>
<P>
We were never comfortable with the rear-window hydraulics when they are fully 
extended. They raise the hatchback almost beyond the reach of smaller folk. 
They certainly were stiff enough to make closing the lid an exercise in 
leverage roughly the equivalent of humping a 40-pound bag of Kibbles 'n Bits 
from a high shelf. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Why Those Back Seats? 
</P>
<P>
And when will Porsche and Nissan and all the 2+2 designers find courage enough 
to dump those upholstered pie plates posing as rear seats? 
</P>
<P>
They certainly aren't large enough for adults. Few owners of two children 
purchase Porsches, and single people rarely ferry neighborhood kids to 
preschool. So better to lose the seats and return the room to trunk space, 
which is something all sports cars can use. 
</P>
<P>
The subtle bother about the 944S2, however, is the surprising, but full-blown 
sense of boredom that comes with the car. In 800 miles, not one head turned and 
not even brighter youngsters saw this new Porsche as anything but an older 
Porsche. 
</P>
<P>
It is a car that will last. 
</P>
<P>
It is a car with a painless depreciation rate. 
</P>
<P>
It also is a car offering an odd formula -- 1989 performance from a 1979 shape. 
But at a 1999 price.

STYLISTS PUT A NEW FACE ON TRICKS WITH MAKEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Women who wish they could change certain features about their faces are 
starting to think of makeup artists in a new way -- as experts who can offer 
very specific advice that can postpone cosmetic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
How do you make lips look fuller without collagen injections, give eyes a lift 
without a surgeon's incisions, diminish the effect of wrinkles and lines 
without a chemical peel? These are the sorts of questions modern makeup artists 
answer by putting into practice the latest tricks of their trade. More than 
ever, they say, makeup used the right way will erase years from a woman's 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
A private lesson in how it is done can be an expensive proposition -- an 
hourlong appointment, with a complete makeup application, usually costs $40 or 
more. So it is helpful to know ahead of time which expert to consult about 
which particular problem. And the experts all do have their special skills, 
just as restaurant chefs have certain dishes they prepare especially well. 
</P>
<P>
Four Los Angeles makeup artists recently demonstrated the techniques they are 
best known for: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eugenia Weston of Senna Cosmetics, a Tarzana boutique, applies lipstick for 
maximum effect. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joanna Fradkin of the Pigments boutique in Beverly Hills shapes eyebrows to 
frame and balance facial features. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Andrea Kessel, who is based in the Joseph Martin hair salon in Beverly 
Hills, enhances the natural features of women over age 40. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mary Brando of Vanity in Los Angeles teaches women to apply eyeliner in 
ways that seem to alter the shape of their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
To create the perfect lips, Weston has developed a process that minimizes very 
wide shapes, or maximizes narrow ones. It involves several steps. 
</P>
<P>
First, she covers the area around the lips with a jojoba-based cream to soften 
lines and help the lipstick adhere. For narrow lips, she blends an off-white 
color highlighter above the mouth only to create a light-reflecting area that 
makes the lips seem more prominent. 
</P>
<P>
She outlines top and bottom lips with a pencil, drawing along the outer line of 
narrow lips, or the inner line of very full lips, rounding the line for a 
fuller effect on narrow lips, or making it slightly concave to cut in on very 
wide lips. 
</P>
<P>
She completely colors the lips with the same pencil before she applies 
lipstick. The colors should match, she says. And she explains that pale colors 
minimize and darker colors maximize the fullness of the lips. 
</P>
<P>
Weston applies lipstick with a padded lamb's wool "smoothie" that looks like a 
small gumdrop on a stick and can be found in beauty-supply stores. It gives a 
more natural, matte finish, instead of a shiny one. 
</P>
<P>
Bette Midler, one of her best customers, is also one of her ideal students. 
Following Weston's direction, Midler makes the most of her full lips with a 
pale lip color applied for a matte look. 
</P>
<P>
At the Pigments boutique, Fradkin tells clients their eyebrows are the most 
important feature of their face. Audrey Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor are two 
leading examples of famous brows that have enhanced a face. 
</P>
<P>
Well-shaped eyebrows, tapered to form a near-straight line that extends to just 
beyond the eyes' outer corner, can give droopy or hooded eyes an uplifted and 
pronounced appearance, Fradkin explains. 
</P>
<P>
To shape a brow, she draws parallel lines along the top and the bottom of it, 
using an off-white color pencil. The top and bottom lines angle slightly upward 
and are about the same length. Then she draws a line from the curve of the 
temple to the top of the eyebrow, to tell her where the arch point should be. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, with a taupe-colored pencil, she fills in the eyebrow, shaping it as 
she wants it to be, and clears away hairs that lie outside that ideal shape. 
Then she brushes the brow upward and trims the top hairs with a pair of fine 
scissors. 
</P>
<P>
"A good rule of thumb is to tweeze from the arch out," she says. "People think 
that tweezing close to the nose gives them a wide-eyed look but it is really 
just unnatural looking. Anything that doesn't follow the bone structure is 
unflattering." 
</P>
<P>
For bare spots in eyebrows, and for very light-color brows, Fradkin fills in 
with a taupe pencil, using short strokes. She follows that by brushing the 
brows to smudge the color for a more natural look. 
</P>
<P>
She uses the neutral taupe shade, by the way, even on dark brunettes. "If the 
color is too dark the eyebrow gets out of balance with the rest of the face," 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
Balancing the eyes with the rest of the face, and emphasizing their shape and 
color, is one of makeup's primary benefits. Kessel, at the Joseph Martin salon, 
does this with a few well-chosen colors, lightly applied. 
</P>
<P>
A number of her customers are over age 40. The natural lines and wrinkles in 
their complexions, their naturally lighter hair color and their softer-edged 
features look best when covered with a light-handed makeup, she explains. 
</P>
<P>
The first step in her system for making up the eyes is to brush the lids with 
pale peach-color powder, forming a light-color background for shades to come. 
"The pale background makes the eye look bigger," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
Next she brushes a dusty rose shade into the crease of the eye and along the 
bone, and blends the color upward, toward the brow. She adds a bronze-color 
powder to the crease in the lid, and blends it. And she uses neutral-toned 
powder eyeliner, dotting it between the lashes and smudging it. She coats them 
with a soft, brown-plum mascara. She uses no dark colors and draws no solid 
lines, because both are harsh looking and add years to a woman's appearance. 
</P>
<P>
And she works with matte powders only. "Iridescents emphasize every line" she 
says. She also explains why her natural-looking makeup requires a number of 
steps. "What takes the most time is blending colors smoothly, to emphasize the 
contours or the bone structure and bring out the skin and eye colors." 
</P>
<P>
At the Vanity boutique, Brando is a master at applying eyeliner, a technique 
she uses to create all sorts of illusions. She uses dry powders, not liquid 
liners, because the liquid line tends to look dense and solid. 
</P>
<P>
Extend a line beyond the outer edge of small, close-set eyes and they seem to 
become elongated, she says. Outline the corner of the eyes only, in a warm 
brown color, and narrow eyes suddenly appear rounder and wider. Draw a 
deep-colored line on the inner rim of the lid and protruding eyes seem to lose 
their bulging appearance. 
</P>
<P>
Brando usually prefers eyeliners in neutral shades of brown that don't compete 
with the eye's color. 
</P>
<P>
"I always say there are no unattractive women, only lazy women," she says. 
"Everyone can learn how to apply their makeup to bring out their own best 
features."

'LICENCE': A DARKER VERSION OF BOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Time marches, age withers and everything falls into decay . . . except James 
Bond, still spruce and deadly after all these years. 
</P>
<P>
The series has been with us since 1962 and, like many another old timer, tends 
to repeat itself. Yet, every once in a while, it pulls in its stomach, pops the 
gun from its cummerbund, arches its eyebrow and gets off another bull's-eye. 
The newest, "Licence to Kill" (citywide), is probably one of the five or six 
best of Bond. 
</P>
<P>
At first, it's hard to suggest why. "Licence" (the title is deliberately 
anglicized) milks the formula as before: a mix of sex, violence and exotic 
scenery, with Bond on a one-man raid against an archetype of evil, while 
seducing women and taking in sights. Here, the locales include the sea-spray 
expanses of Key West and the garish palaces of Mexico City disguised as a 
fictitious "Isthmus City." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the overall tone has gotten more burnished, somber. The new movie sends the 
new Bond, Timothy Dalton, on a desperate one-man vendetta against an apparently 
omnipotent South American cocaine czar. And it isolates him, kills or maims 
three of his best friends, strips him of his rank, his government, his very 
license to kill. It leaves him with almost nothing but his wits -- and dear old 
chic-weapons expert Q (Desmond Llewelyn), who pops up ex officio with another 
bag of lethal cameras and exploding toilet accessories. 
</P>
<P>
It even strips away a little libido. As Timothy Dalton plays the role -- with 
wolfishly sad eyes -- this is a more wounded and sensitive Bond than we've ever 
seen, the sort of Bond the late Laurence Olivier might have imagined. (The look 
is there, but not the lines.) Bond's appetite for sex seems more distracted, 
tentative. His women -- Carey Lowell as a helicopter pilot and double agent, 
Talisa Soto as the drug czar's faithless mistress -- are more self-sufficient. 
His armor has sprung a leak. 
</P>
<P>
Where Sean Connery was wry and self-confident and Roger Moore natty and 
self-mocking, Dalton projects something strange for a hero identified with 
impeccable sadism: inner torment. The walk is tense; cigarettes pour out fumes 
of Angst; the smile carries a hint of pain. 
</P>
<P>
Connery always seemed to be enjoying the world hugely -- and he carried the 
audience along with him, made them enjoy it as much as he did. Roger Moore 
didn't seem to be enjoying the world so much as ignoring it and, instead, 
enjoying himself -- or perhaps some internal reflection. Dalton, by extreme 
contrast, doesn't project much enjoyment at all. He projects pain. And pain, 
obsession and revenge are what "Licence to Kill" is all about. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a film about an urbane adventurer, moving with eerie confidence 
through a violent, chaotic world. It's a film about a bereaved friend, 
half-crazed with grief, relying on his instincts and professionalism to carry 
him through a situation rotten with peril. Like Stallone's Rambo or Eastwood's 
Dirty Harry, this Bond has been stiffed by the world and abandoned by his 
government. He is a loner, driven by overwhelming personal hurts -- confronted 
with a cool, sexy foe who, in some curious way, almost recalls the old Bond. 
</P>
<P>
Previous villains in the series tended to be older, more urbane, wicked 
paterfamilias figures. Instead, Robert Davi, a heavy in "Die Hard," makes Franz 
Sanchez -- who's modeled on modern drug kings like Carlos Lehder of Colombia's 
Medellin cartel -- a sexy adventurer who metes out rough justice with style and 
merciless sarcasm. And he has a code: loyalty matters to him more than money. 
Against this new-style villain, Bond, the dark angel, twists what seems to be 
Sanchez's only good quality -- his insistence on loyalty -- against him, trying 
to strip away his friends one by one and convince him of their treachery. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to isolate Bond as well as Sanchez. Yet it leaves him with everything 
that counts: the gimmicks, the archetypes, the formulas, the old jokes of a 
full 27-year and 16-film tour of duty. Like all Bond movies it has its 
set-pieces, chief among them a roaring, rousing Mad Max-style climactic, 
exploding chase involving three Kenworth trucks, jeeps and a small plane set on 
a desolately beautiful Mexican mountain road. It's planned and staged with the 
exquisite carnage of a silent comedy car chase, with gags topping gags, and 
surprises leaping over each other -- just as one flaming truck leaps over the 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
Produced and co-written by old hands Albert Broccoli and Richard Maibaum (whose 
tour dates back to 1962's "Dr. No"), directed and co-written by new veterans 
John Glen and Michael G. Wilson, the movie whips up a combustible brew of old 
and new. Is it just updating the new cliches: the incessant car crashes, 
gruesome sadism, heavy hardware, feistier heroines? (Just as there used to be 
obligatory sexpots-in-distress, Carey Lowell almost seems an obligatory lone 
wolf.) Perhaps -- but all those movies stole from the Bond films, too, often 
draining out the crucial elements that make them fun: self-kidding humor and 
exotic locales. 
</P>
<P>
"Licence to Kill" (MPAA-rated PG-13, despite extreme violence and suggestions 
of sex) has the usual bursts of illogic, the gratuitous sex or violence. But 
gratuitous sex or violence have always been fixtures of Bond's world. Often the 
formulas grate on you. Here, they ignite. This is a guilt-edged Bond; there's a 
core of darkness and pain in the glittery world exploding around it.

A 'TEMPTATION' WITHOUT PASSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, Times Theater Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's all there in the title. Dissident Czech playwright Vaclav Havel is nothing 
if not direct. His "Temptation" at the Mark Taper Forum is about many aspects 
of the word: the forces that draw us deeper into the wrong kind of obedience, 
and those that tempt us away into areas of self and other knowledge. Good 
knowledge and bad -- depending on where you are when, who you are and what is 
expected of you. 
</P>
<P>
Like the other Havel plays seen in Los Angeles ("A Private View," "Largo 
Desolato"), "Temptation" re-creates that indeterminate police-state atmosphere 
of doubt and insecurity, where Big Brother is always watching and no one is 
ever at ease. But this time Havel has wandered into more fantastic territory, 
moving into the realm of the metaphysical to make his anti-totalitarian stand. 
He shows us the torture of self-doubt under pressure, lending it color, body 
and a voice in a re-enactment of the Faust legend. 
</P>
<P>
Stylistically speaking, this is a real departure for Havel, whose work until 
now -- or what we've had of it -- has been firmly anchored in a Kafkaesque 
reality. Absurdist but concrete. 
</P>
<P>
With "Temptation," we enter a realm of repression that reaches beyond politics 
to the frontiers of man's conscience. It's not enough that there are external 
constraints in the so-called real and politicized world. What about the inner 
ones of the soul? Those we impose on ourselves? What about our weaknesses -- 
those haunting, nagging "temptations" from within? 
</P>
<P>
The result is a more theatrical play than Havel's previous ones -- down to some 
vibrantly colorful scenes and costumes (the creations of Csilla Marki) at the 
end. But as staged here by Richard Jordan, "Temptation" remains willfully dry 
and -- as most plays of protest seem condemned to be -- a bit obvious, both in 
terms of the dialogue (most often explicit) and of its symbolism. 
</P>
<P>
The place is a generic scientific institute in Prague. (John Iacovelli did the 
eclectic sets that include a giant fountain pen hanging, Damocletian -- get it? 
-- diagonally over the stage before the action begins, returning to that 
position as the play winds to its conclusion.) 
</P>
<P>
Our protagonist is Henry Foustka (Mark Harelik), one of the young scientists, 
who tries to walk a fine line between the pure and occult sciences, goodness 
and badness, loyalties to his superiors -- and/or to himself. His supernatural 
dabblings have the predictable result of provoking a visit from a poisonous 
little devil. He's the well-named Fistula (Robin Gammell), a ubiquitous, 
Chaplinesque fellow who smells like Limburger cheese and who, like his aroma, 
won't go away now that he's here. 
</P>
<P>
We watch Foustka/Faust, a former favorite, lose ground in the hermetic environs 
of the institute he serves -- a sycophantic world of whispering Special 
Secretaries (Richard Vidan), unctuous Directors (Michael Constantine), 
yea-saying Deputy Directors (Ron Campbell) and craven scientists (John 
Apicella, Savannah Smith Boucher, Tim Pulice). 
</P>
<P>
Since Foustka is fundamentally a bit craven too, his wishy-washy denials and 
recantations merely backfire when his forbidden experiments are exposed and he 
is accused of serving other masters. 
</P>
<P>
With Fistula pulling invisible strings, all -- er -- hell breaks loose: The 
sweet little secretary Marketa (Keeley Stanley) is fired for trying to defend 
Foustka; his colleagues jockey shamelessly for his position; his girlfriend, 
the strong-minded Vilma (Lillian Garrett), is propelled into the arms of 
another man (Hector Mercado) and, despite Foustka's efforts at self-redemption 
(truth juggling and avoidance tactics), havoc results. 
</P>
<P>
A final costume ball, designed to exorcise the very devils that led to the 
misunderstanding between Foustka and his superiors, is themed as a witches' 
sabbath. The institute director, in counterpoint irony, comes dressed as a Pope 
holding a trident. Here director Jordan goes beyond Havel's call for a 
"conspicuous devil" costume and opts, rightly or wrongly, for making his own 
political statement. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't go far enough. In an otherwise well-acted production, Jordan's 
staging remains much too restrained. While Harelik, Garrett, Constantine and 
especially the brilliantly physical Gammell provide juice and color, Jordan 
doesn't let the second act rip. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of sweeping to a lurid, phantasmagoric climax, this "Temptation" only 
gets to the general vicinity -- and by degrees. The ending as written specifies 
a no-holds-barred, rip-roarin' descent into Hades. But Jordan delivers an 
entirely too cool and too manicured facsimile. 
</P>
<P>
Just why is hard to tell. We can't lay these choices at the tired old feet of 
"different sensibilities." American theater knows how to be every bit as 
passionate as its European counterpart. Havel overcame the detachment of the 
early, didactic scenes to end his play with a deliberate flamboyant flourish of 
jeering and spent emotion. He got it right. The Taper gets it partly right. 
That's all. The disappointment is especially keen because "Temptation" is 
arguably Havel's best play to date.

TICKET SALES FOR KEN HILL'S 'PHANTOM' ARE HALTED IN ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

The Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim halted ticket sales Thursday for Ken Hill's 
"The Phantom of the Opera," following a threat of legal action by the 
producers, who have claimed the sales are unauthorized. 
</P>
<P>
H. Yale Gutnick, the attorney for the Phantom Touring Co., said the theater had 
done "a substantial amount" of business in advance ticket sales. "We don't know 
how many tickets they've sold because we are not getting good information from 
them," Gutnick said Thursday from his office in Pittsburgh, Pa., "but our 
conservative 'guesstimate' is in the neighborhood of $100,000 at least." 
</P>
<P>
Celebrity Theatre officials have failed to respond to repeated inquiries from 
The Times, which reported Wednesday that Hill's "Phantom" would not be coming 
to the theater. 
</P>
<P>
The musical comedy -- a version of the "The Phantom of the Opera" that inspired 
Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical -- has been advertised by the theater for a 
December engagement without authorization for several months, Gutnick said. He 
was scheduled to speak with theater officials Thursday and said he would demand 
that all ticket purchases be refunded. 
</P>
<P>
A box-office clerk said Thursday that ticket sales had been discontinued that 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Klaus Kolmar, the New York booking agent for the show's coming national tour, 
said earlier this week that the theater had been negotiating for the show for 
several months but had never concluded a contract. He said the producers 
required a deposit in the "low five figures" and that the theater "never 
deposited 2 cents." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Kolmar said, the producers of the tour had rejected both the 
theater's seating capacity and the five-day engagement that Celebrity officials 
have been advertising because "it was inadequate for the production." "The 
potential gross did not make any sense," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The theater's full-round configuration has a capacity of 2,500 seats. It would 
have to be transformed into a proscenium setting for the show, reducing 
capacity to about 1,500 seats. Kolmar said the show needs between 1,800 and 
2,500 seats to turn a profit in a limited run. 
</P>
<P>
Hill's "Phantom" will play the the 2,198-seat Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles 
(Nov. 20 to Dec. 3).

KLSX-FM morning deejay Peter Tilden, whose 6-10 a.m. show was floundering in 
the ratings, has been fired and former KMET jock David Perry will take over his 
duties on Monday. . He will be joined by Kate Hayes, who had been on the show 
with Tilden. KLSX General Manager Bob Moore said Thursday that Tilden was 
"miscast" in the morning slot. "I believe he's a very talented and creative 
individual but all of our research and obviously the Arbitrons (ratings) said 
our audience wanted a music-intensive and music-oriented person in the 
mornings," Moore said. "Our particular people didn't want that type of talky 
morning show. I think in the right environment he would have been very 
successful. But, we had to listen to our audience. . . . It was a critic's hit 
and an audience failure." Moore also pointed to the increasingly tough 
competition locally among morning drive-time air personalities. Arbitron 
ratings for the spring quarter released this week showed that the station had 
plummeted in the ratings since Tilden started in September. The station had 
ranked ninth last fall and dropped to 21st in the last survey. Perry, who had 
worked most recently at KLSX's sister station in Detroit (WCSX) and at KMET 
from 1974-80, will feature more music and less talk, Moore said, a familiar 
rallying cry in Los Angeles radio these days. ALEENE MacMINN

Is This Art, Or What?: An exhibition at the Winnipeg Art Gallery drew 
complaints from a woman this week because it included nude photographs of men 
by American artist Lucas Samaras. However, after police looked at the exhibit 
to determine if it was obscene, they said, "Case closed. The photos don't meet 
the definition of obscenity under the criminal code. They may be in bad taste, 
but obscene, no." ALEENE MacMINN

Maria Casale, 26, of North Hollywood is one of four finalists in the the U.S.A. 
International Harp Competition that will wrap up this evening in Bloomington, 
Ind. Two other Americans and and a 19-year-old girl from France are the other 
finalists. All four will perform solo and with orchestra tonight before a 
winner is selected. The harp competition is the first in the United States in 
20 years. It was founded by Susann McDonald, professor of music at Indiana 
University and chair of the school's harp department. Thirty-seven harpists 
from 14 countries have performed at the IU School of Music since the 
competition began July 4. ALEENE MacMINN

DISNEY'S 'PETER PAN': A FANTASY THAT DEFIES THE RAVAGES OF AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For children who grew up during the Baby Boom era, there were always two "Peter 
Pans": the TV version with Mary Martin and the animated feature by Walt Disney. 
Each had its special charms, and the cartoon "Peter Pan" (in rerelease 
citywide) remains one of the most exciting and colorful films in the Disney 
canon. 
</P>
<P>
Disney discarded the wistful nostalgia for the illusory innocence of childhood 
that pervaded Sir James Barrie's original play and replaced it with brash 
Yankee energy. This Peter Pan is a cocky, all-American boy, more like Tom 
Sawyer than the smug British popinjay Barrie envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney artists also changed or discarded much of the traditional stage 
business. For the first time, Peter was voiced by an actor (Bobby Driscoll), 
rather than portrayed by an actress. The Crocodile, who had always been an 
offstage sound effect, appeared on the screen. The artists eliminated Peter's 
impassioned plea to the audience to clap their hands to prove they believe in 
fairies and save Tinker Bell's life as a theatrical effect, rather than a 
cinematic one. 
</P>
<P>
When the film was first released, critics complained about the portrayal of 
Tinker Bell as a human pixie rather than as a beam of light. This depiction is 
actually very close to Barrie's descriptions of her as feminine, vain and 
slightly vulgar. Watch her monumental self-pity as she collapses into tears 
while Captain Hook bewails her abandonment by Peter. 
</P>
<P>
The Disney crew made even greater changes in the Captain. Barrie's elegant 
pirate who had "something of the grand seigneur" about him was transformed into 
a volatile comic villain. Captain Hook's battles with the ravenous Crocodile 
include some of the wildest, funniest scenes in any Disney cartoon. They 
represent a near-perfect marriage of slapstick animation and a deliciously 
overplayed vocal performance by the late Hans Conried. 
</P>
<P>
Made in 1953 when the artists were still at the height of their powers, "Peter 
Pan" features some genuinely magic moments that expand the original play. No 
stage wiring could duplicate the freedom of movement Wendy, John and Michael 
experience when they discover they can fly. The sequence in which Peter turns 
the pirate ship to gold and sails it over the London skyline stands out as an 
example of a fantasy that can be realized only in animation. 
</P>
<P>
The film carries its years very lightly, with one regrettable exception: its 
depiction of the Indians, including the "What Made the Red Man Red?" number. 
Although Disney treated them more respectfully than Barrie had, these 
characters are '50s movie Injuns, whose dialogue runs to "heap big" this and 
"do-um" that. The sequence is too long and too important to the story to cut. 
(Parts of it are also beautifully animated, especially Tiger Lily's graceful 
dance.) For better or worse -- probably worse -- it remains a testament to 
Hollywood's ethnic sensibilities during the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
This complaint aside, "Peter Pan" is a wonderfully upbeat family entertainment 
that offers a welcome respite from the summer glut of fistfights, shoot-outs 
and car chases.

REFRAINS OF FAMILY SKIRMISHES HEARD IN 'SONGS OF WAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The title of Murray Schisgal's new play, "The Songs of War" (at the indoor Gem 
Theatre of the Grove Shakespeare Festival), appears to have two meanings. 
</P>
<P>
It refers to the patriotic ditties and other American pop tunes from the eras 
of the two World Wars, heard throughout the show. But it also refers to the 
relentlessly argumentative refrains that were the skirmishes in the war between 
Saul and Bertha Sakowitz, the unhappily married parents of our narrator, Calvin 
Saks. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, this is another Jewish-family-gone-sour play. Although the songs signal a 
nostalgic look back at the era of the narrator's youth, the nostalgia seems 
fraudulent. Schisgal doesn't show us a single moment when these people were 
functioning as a happy family. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a muddle. Schisgal is working at cross purposes with himself. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble begins with the role of the narrator. Calvin tells us about his 
teen years from the perspective of himself at 60. Perhaps Schisgal wanted to 
avoid charges of imitating Neil Simon, whose trilogy about his own youth in a 
similar time and place ("Brighton Beach Memoirs," "Biloxi Blues," "Broadway 
Bound") was told from the perspective of a young man who had recently lived 
through the events he describes. 
</P>
<P>
There is no other reason to present Calvin at such an advanced age, and there 
is a big reason not to do so. Calvin's obsessive search to discover which 
parent was more responsible for his unhappy youth is something you would expect 
from a relatively young man. By the age of 60, most people have come to terms 
with such issues -- especially when, as in Calvin's case, the answer is so 
obvious: Both parents were responsible, and so was the culture in which they 
were raised. Next subject, please. It's petty for a 60-year-old to devote a lot 
of time to agonizing over which parent he can blame most intensely for his 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
But Schisgal compounds this basic miscalculation by making it almost impossible 
for us to see the kid within this 60-year-old. Calvin is dressed in white tie 
and tails. While this makes him look dapper during the show's musical 
interludes, it makes him look ridiculous when he plays the kitchen-sink scenes 
from his youth. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of Steeve Arlen to play Calvin makes matters even worse. Arlen 
was born in Wales, and he sounds like it. Picture a 60-year-old man with a 
Welsh accent, wearing white tie, playing a 16-year-old kid from Brooklyn. It's 
bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Schisgal was going for a light absurdist effect. There are occasional 
snatches of dialogue -- when the parents' bickering breaks into a battle of 
nursery rhymes, for example -- that would also indicate this. But this use of 
stylization is inconsistent and feels arbitrary. 
</P>
<P>
The same can be said for the songs themselves, the likes of "K-K-K-Katy," 
"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree," "Der Fuhrer's Face," "Remember Pearl Harbor," 
and a few from the World War I era (Calvin's father was a veteran of the Great 
War). 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally they serve the story, as when Calvin's embittered mother 
(full-throated Connie Danese), anxious about the possibility of an affair with 
a neighbor, Roy, (Raymond Lynch), sings "My Buddy" straight from the heart at a 
war rally. But more often the songs seem designed primarily to give the actors 
a chance to sing and dance. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, they also set the mood for the period, but two or three of them 
could have done that, while there are a dozen or so in the show. Maybe the 
sunny optimism of the era, as heard in its music, is supposed to be in ironic 
contrast to the domestic squabbles between Saul and Bertha. But without more 
diligent work connecting the story to the songs, the irony dissipates. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, this couple's marital problems transcend the period. These two 
would have been at each other's throats in any era (and indeed, we get glimpses 
of them still at odds in their old age). 
</P>
<P>
Except for Arlen, director Jerome Guardino's cast is at home in these somewhat 
stereotyped roles. Paul Keith plays the tormented Saul with a hangdog look that 
is transformed when he remembers his single days in Paris, and Juliet Landau is 
winsome as Calvin's frail but plucky sister. 
</P>
<P>
Hale Porter plays Calvin's Zada (grandfather), chilly and remote. We're told 
that Zada killed pigeons and served them as appetizers at a wedding. We 
half-believe it. 
</P>
<P>
The set design, by Christa Bartels, is meant to evoke a rehearsal room rather 
than a real Brooklyn household. Schisgal obviously wants to tell his story 
outside the boundaries of realism. But he hasn't figured out how to do it yet. 
</P>
<P>
 At 12852 Main St., Garden Grove, Wednesdays through Sundays at 8 p.m., ending 
Aug. 5. Tickets: $10-$20; (714) 636-7213.

RESTAURANTS IN FRANCE AS OLD AS THE REVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
PARIS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a Frenchman's pleasure to dine out. And, in a sense, his patriotic duty. 
</P>
<P>
The great revolution over which countless aristocrats lost their heads put 
ideas into others, notably the brigades of private maitres d'hotel and chefs 
facing sudden unemployment. In an era when it was dangerous to be less 
revolutionary than one's neighbor, the cleverest among this new class of 
unemployed disavowed their aristocratic ties and looked to put their talents to 
work in patriotic ways. 
</P>
<P>
Though cafes, which served the various revolutionary camps, are an older 
Parisian tradition, restaurants, as we know them, are truly a revolutionary 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired, it seems, by a man named Boulanger who in 1765 opened Paris' first a 
la carte restaurant on the Rue des Poulies, several restaurants opened (and 
closed) during the years of upheaval. Some survivors are still operating, 
remarkably unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Eat in any number of cafes or restaurants in the center of Paris today and 
you're likely to be served some history with your napoleon. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the tale of the two Tour d'Argents. 
</P>
<P>
Latter-day gourmets are familiar with the Tour d'Argent, arguably France's most 
famous restaurant, tracing its roots to an inn founded in the shadow of Notre 
Dame in 1582. Following the trend, it adapted a carte, or menu, around 1780, 
executed by a kitchen brigade of the type formerly reserved for aristocratic 
homes. Serving kings and courtesans, it introduced the idea that one need not 
own a country manor to become a gourmet. Viewed as undemocratic, it was 
pillaged by patriots and auctioned. 
</P>
<P>
As current owner Claude Terrail phrases it, "the ball closed" for a time. It 
was eventually reopened by Napoleon's chef, and has since served kings and 
commoners thousands of its famous numbered ducks. It has retained three stars 
from Michelin longer than any other Parisian restaurant and, according to many, 
still merits them. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to its penthouse dining room (moved upstairs decades ago) provides a 
magnificent bird's-eye perspective of Notre Dame, an experience that nearly 
justifies the lofty prices. Current chef Manuel Martinez combines contemporary 
and classic, under Terrail's ever-vigilant eye. A fixed-price lunch menu hovers 
around $50, while dinners climb closer to $100 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour d'Argent, 15 Quai de la Tournelle, 75005. Telephone 43.54.23.31. Closed 
Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The other Tour d'Argent sits at the Place de la Bastille. National Archive 
documents establish its opening in 1640. Named for Henri VI's treasury tower in 
the original Bastille prison, this Tour d'Argent played an active role in the 
conflicts of 1789. Owned by Gilbert Gaillard, captain of the people's army, it 
was a principal gathering site surrounded by barricades and later served as a 
hospital. Reopened recently after a two-year renovation by third-generation 
owner Jean Francois Solignac, it remains a more common ground than the other 
Tour d'Argent, with which it is still waging a battle, this time in court, over 
the use of its name. 
</P>
<P>
Its terrace overlooks the curving glass front of the newly unveiled Opera 
Bastille. The brasserie-style menu features simple grilled items and shellfish 
platters at prices and hours (until 1:30 p.m.) to make republicans smile. 
Dinner for one person is $40 or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour d'Argent Bastille, 6 Place de La Bastille, 75012. Telephone 43.42.90.32. 
Open daily. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
While patriots stormed the Bastille by day, evenings in the Palais Royal 
steamed with more carnal passions. 
</P>
<P>
An arcaded square built in the 17th Century for Cardinal Richelieu, the gardens 
by the 1760s drew Paris' demimonde to cafes, gambling houses and brothels. The 
most sparkling survivor of the era is Grand Vefour, which traces its history to 
Antoine Aubertot's Cafe de Chartres, a fashionable see-and-be scene of the era, 
established in 1780. Now classified a national monument, the restaurant takes 
its name from Jean Vefour, who bought it during the Restoration. 
</P>
<P>
Its magnificent decor, Louis XVI-garlanded ceiling and elaborate wall frescoes 
often backdropped Napoleon and Josephine as diners. Owned today by the 
Tattinger (Champagne) group with Jean-Claude Lhonneur at the stove this season, 
its menu is classic, meriting two Michelin stars. Prices are far from 
democratic (around $100 per person), but there's an excellent fixed-price lunch 
menu at $45. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Vefour, 17 rue de Beaujolais, Paris 75001. Telephone 42.96.56.27. Closed 
Saturday lunch and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Far from the Bastille and Palais Royal was a seamy little inn called the 
Auberge du Dauphin. Set on a dirt road leading west out of Paris, it became a 
carriage stop on the journey from the Tuileries to the Bois de Boulogne. If the 
Auberge lacked refinement, the location held great potential, and Michel Doyen 
rented it for 1,200 a year in 1791. The miserable road became the Champs 
Elysees; the Inn, the elegant Ledoyen. Surviving the centuries, its own 
fortunes rising and falling with subsequent republics, Ledoyen rose phoenixlike 
last fall when its lease was taken by Regine, Paris' nightclub queen. 
Extensively remodeled, its kitchens have been taken in hand by three-star chef 
Jacques Maximin (formerly of Hotel Negresco, Nice). 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the place is savoring its reputation as one of Paris' most expensive 
and controversial restaurants, while flaunting its revival across the avenue at 
another restaurant, Laurent, which traces its beginning to the same period. 
Consultant Maxim recently passed the relay baton, so to speak, to chef Philippe 
Dorange, but a Provencal flavor remains. Dinner in the subdued salon of Le 
Guepard can easily pass the $100 per person level, inspiring loyalty among 
some, derision among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Ledoyen, Carre des Champs-Elysees, 75008 Paris. Telephone 47.42.23.23. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Down a Palais Royal passageway on the Rue du Beaujolais existed another 
restaurant directly linked to the revolution. Antoine Beauvilliers, the Count 
of Provence's officer de bouche (chef), unemployed after his employer's 
emigration, decided to open a restaurant in 1790. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant, offering 168 menu choices, was an immediate success. While 
other restaurants rose little above simple tavern status, Beauvilliers added 
touches to warm the hearts of contemporary designers -- a dining room of 
tasseled silk, liveried waiters, a well-stocked wine cellar and refined 
cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested during the Terror, Beauvilliers survived, and for 15 years was Paris' 
most touted and trend-setting restaurateur. As Briffault wrote in 1846, 
"Quickly raising the reputation of restaurateurs, he did for our cuisine what 
the 17th and 18th centuries did for our literature." 
</P>
<P>
Though Beauvilliers no longer exists on its original site, those in search of 
the restaurant's spirit will do well to take a little license (and considerable 
cash) and climb up to Montmartre, where a restaurant conceived in his honor

When the revolution broke out, partisans chose their camps or, more likely, 
their cafes. Royalists gathered at the Cafe Valois, while citizens frequented 
the Cafe des Aveugles. From the Cafe de Foy, Camille Desmoulins incited the 
crowds on the 13th of July, 1789, and Danton could frequently be found at the 
Cafe Parnasse, partly because the owner was his father-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
While these have disappeared, there are others which carry on in much the same 
revolutionary spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Billing itself as the world's oldest cafe, and founded in 1686, Le Procope 
quickly became the fief of politicos and journalists. Playwrights and 
performers from the nearby Comedie Francaise were habitues, and by the turn of 
the century Procope was one of the most celebrated of Paris' cafes. During the 
revolution, it was the meeting place of Marat, Danton and Robespierre. It's 
from there that the order to invade the Tuileries came. 
</P>
<P>
Surviving as an undistinguished bistro since then, it underwent radical change 
recently when purchased by an ambitious Parisian restaurant group. Salons 
refurbished in 18th-Century bourgeois style now set the stage for waiters in 
Napoleonic waistcoats and a menu of "reign of terror" selections: Dr. Guillotin 
fish soup. 
</P>
<P>
The best formula here, perhaps: Have a cup of coffee, read the newspapers and 
contemplate the Rights of Man.

LET THEM EAT CAKE -- ALL 50 FEET OF IT

There are certain phrases one doesn't expect to hear from the mouths of pastry 
chefs at work: "Hand me that masking tape to stabilize the cake," for example. 
When building a 50-foot high layer cake in honor of the French Revolution 
bicentennial, however, masking tape can be essential. 
</P>
<P>
Other required ingredients: 3,600 eggs, 200 egg whites, 1,430 pounds of genoise 
(sponge cake) mix, 638 pounds of raspberry filling, 72 bottles of Cointreau 
liqueur, one ton of sugar, 355 pounds of frosting. You also need a good supply 
of wood, Styrofoam, stainless steel tubing, electrical wire and the services of 
a professional welder. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday morning, on the Hollywood Park race-track infield, preparation for 
the 50-foot high cake, the focal point of this Sunday's French Food and Wine 
Festival, were well under way. Scattered early bird handicappers in the 
grandstands occasionally glanced up from their Racing Forms to observe the 
activity, but mostly they ignored the gathering of the 15 or so white-clad 
pastry chefs who climbed about the wood arches of the not-yet-completed cake 
frame, applying bits of frosting and mugging for newspaper photographers. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at a nearby bench getting drenched by a sprinkler, the cake's designer, 
Citrus chef Michel Richard, shook his head and said, "Oh, I hope they don't 
turn the sprinklers on my cake." 
</P>
<P>
Hanging 25 feet in the air in the tub of a hydraulic lift was Don Slater, the 
Hollywood Park chef who did much of the grunt work in construction of the cake 
base. Trained at New York's Culinary Institute of America, he makes 
monster-size ice carvings, cheese-and-wine displays and cakes. But, he said, 
"This cake is the biggest thing I've done, though." 
</P>
<P>
"It's 50 feet and 35 inches," said Michel Grobon, Hollywood Park's executive 
chef. "We measured all the pieces yesterday." Grobon organized the cake-baking 
and prepared the way for the 35 restaurants and wineries expected to set up 
food booths for Sunday's festival. 
</P>
<P>
When finished, after an all-night decorating session Saturday, the cake will 
look like two down-sized models of Paris' Arc de Triomphe stacked atop one 
antoher -- plus a steel-tube version of the Eiffel Tower lit by white Christmas 
tree lights atop the arcs. Sixty-watt light bulbs will power eight giant 
candles, and 1,500 pounds of dry ice will prevent frosting meltdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the largest cake you can build without a foundation system," said 
David Davis, the architect who helped plot the cake's structure. Originally, 
the cake was to be 100 feet tall, but that would have required steel 
reinforcement, an elaborate foundation . . . and a building permit. 
</P>
<P>
All of which brings to mind the question: Why build such a tall cake? 
</P>
<P>
Citrus chef Richard, not satisfied with running one of the most respected 
restaurants in town, decided he wanted to create an attention-getting event 
that would spark a sense of community among restaurateurs in Los Angeles: "It's 
so tough here," he says, "so many cliques and groups. In France, everyone in 
the business sticks together." 
</P>
<P>
"It was really important for the cake to have a lot of the fun and flair of 
L.A.," said Davis, "while at he same time giving it a traditional nature. You 
know, Michel is a real classicist." 
</P>
<P>
As the photo shoot ended, Richard teased some of the women chefs and joked with 
some of the men, but those who know him well realized that his mood was 
subdued. The Monday night murder of his closest friend, Andre Coffyn (who was 
heavily involved in the plans of the cake), put an absurd twist on the project 
that kept his mind on the frivolous instead of the very serious. Shortly after 
the photographers left, tears came to his eyes. "Oh Andre," he said, "you 
should be here now."

Here comes another of Joel-Peter Witkin's freak shows. See the hermaphrodites 
posed as classical artworks, the tubby dwarf done up in lace undies, the masked 
Siamese twins, the winged woman with claw feet growing out of her breasts, the 
man wired to a testicle stretcher. See the people lined up on La Brea Avenue, 
waiting to get into the opening of Los Angeles' first solo show by one of the 
art world's favorite weirdos. 
</P>
<P>
To the uninitiated, Witkin's photographs -- represented here in a 10-year 
survey -- look rather like pages torn from a 19th-Century sadist's memory book. 
Setting up grotesque fantasies in theatrical tableaux and "aging" 
black-and-white prints with scratches, chemicals and tissue overlays, he 
creates photographs that probe the horrific depths of romanticism. 
</P>
<P>
These pictures are crawling with more deranged visions that Hieronymus Bosch 
ever imagined. Flesh looks dead, and sometimes it is -- in the case of fetuses 
and cadavers that turn up as models. Fatty protuberances of live people are 
about to be punctured by nails and sharpened sticks, while mechanical 
contraptions seem to be doing excruciating damage to genitals. 
</P>
<P>
Some of these dangers are more in the viewer's eye than in the actual set-ups. 
Witkin, who styles himself as a participant and not a voyeur, engages in a 
degree of visual trickery, but there's enough reality to turn the stomach. The 
"unique" individuals that he solicits for his work are said to be willing 
subjects, however, and most of them don't suffer the extreme indignities that 
some of the "normal" models put up with. 
</P>
<P>
The usual line of critical support for Witkin's work holds that he brilliantly 
and courageously exposes our darkest fears. Maybe so. He surely has a 
netherworld vision and a genius for turning it into pictures. And his timing 
isn't bad either; there seems to be a big audience and market for photographic 
erotica. What makes his work fascinating is not so much its shock value as its 
compulsive artistry. The most amazing thing about Witkin is not that he has 
bizarre fantasies but that he goes to such lengths to make them visual.

In the late '60s Jim Evans was a successful graphic artist designing posters 
and album covers in the psychedelic style popular then. As a boy, the younger 
Richard Duardo hung out with gangs on the streets of East Los Angeles; today he 
is a master printer and computer artist whose prints are in museum collections. 
</P>
<P>
The two artists share an interest in the abstraction, vivid coloration and 
high-contrast images of print, TV and graphic art. Their shared fascination for 
stardom has produced a collaborative series of prints featuring the famous and 
the fair, such as Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, Humphrey Bogart and Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
On view are canvas works that look as if they've been silk-screened with famous 
visages. The artists toy with and selectively alter popular images frozen in 
our brain by repetition -- Madonna in profile, showing off the sinuous line of 
her neck, or the famous movie still of Raquel Welch barely clothed in 
Hollywood's ridiculous version of cavewoman attire. The artists revitalize 
media shots with hand detail, poster art hues and bright silk-screened 
squiggles, but the works are the too-obvious progeny of Warhol's famous people. 
</P>
<P>
Most works remind us that, try as we may to ease our own anxiety by 
immortalizing our stars, they'll all wither just like the rest of us. "The 
Monster" (from the vintage movie "Frankenstein") and his consort, "The Bride," 
work side by side as effective social comment and parody. Repeated views of the 
bare-chested weight lifter Lisa Lyon flexing her biceps as she unzips her 
Calvin Kleins simply emphasize that stars and their biographers tend to confuse 
narcissism with legitimate sensuality. (Zero One Gallery, 7025 Melrose Ave., to 
July 20.) MARLENA DONOHUE

Tokyo artist Tomoharu Murakami makes all-black paintings. They have uniformly 
firm-textured, raised surfaces somewhat like dried sponges. Of the five 
paintings on view, three are identically-sized smaller rectangles and two are 
identically-sized larger rectangles. Maybe they are supposed to be understood 
as impenetrable thick skins that shut out the vivifying presence of light. 
There is surely a deadness about them, a deliberate lock-out of depth coupled 
with the false allure of an inflected surface that reveals nothing. Some 
earnest person is no doubt writing a long and arid monograph about their 
importance to a hermetic corner of contemporary art. More power to him. (James 
Corcoran Gallery, 1327 5th St., to Aug. 5.) CATHY CURTIS

Like falling leaves -- but also amusingly like '50s light fixtures and fabric 
designs -- the translucent long ovals and circles and egg-shaped drifts of 
color layered on top of each other in Donald Traver's large paintings are 
mighty seductive. Named for places in New York's Hudson River Valley, these 
works translate the stems and pods of nature into a wry loveliness. Calder's 
mobiles come to mind, as do Miro's paintings and maybe even the pristine, 
light-filled quality of the Luminist branch of American landscape painting. 
</P>
<P>
But the combination of artless overlapping, amusing structural devices and 
unseen light sources that rim edges with sprays of light is Traver's own sweet 
treat. In "Overlook," bright yellow ovals bunch up busily all over the place 
except for a vertically oriented central black strip on which a bevy of colored 
circles seem to have been dropped from a great height. This is the young New 
York artist's first Los Angeles solo show. 
</P>
<P>
Also on view is a revolving array of brash, look-at-me pieces by gallery 
artists (to Aug. 31). Three tartly conceptual works gathered under the title 
"Virtue Systems" are the work of Lynn Aldrich. In "Faith," a cardboard carton 
sealed with 25 rolls of tape sits on top of a plastic pedestal. "Hope" consists 
of an upside-down array of crutches attached to what looks like an ironing 
board top attached to the wall. "Charity" is a 5-foot pile of cut-out felt 
hearts. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Clower's enigmatic, perhaps sexually referenced "Chistes y Chicas" (Jokes 
and Girls) is a big painting of a wrench suspended in a blue sky above a red 
field sown with Spanish women's names. Kirk Miller's "Competition Stripes" is a 
hooked-up set of skittering, twinkling brake lights. In "Nature and Industry," 
Elizabeth Bryant sprinkles lace silhouettes of buildings and planes and folkish 
patterns over a monumental black-and-white photogrammetric silhouette of a man. 
Other work is by Matt Mulligan, Peter Seidler, Stephen Berens, Peter Halley, 
Gregg Fleishman and Andy Warhol. (Krygier/Landau Contemporary Art, 2114 
Broadway, to Aug. 12.) CATHY CURTIS

Richard Beckman is still in graduate school at the University of New Mexico, 
but his untitled large-scale sculpture in concrete and steel has a calm 
strength and clean, unfussy presence that bodes well for the future. A majestic 
spiral of rusted steel contains a graduated set of triangles; another spiral of 
neatly riveted plywood looks like a giant Slinky; twin curved triangular pieces 
made of concrete and steel rock low to the floor in separate rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest piece (nearly 5 feet tall) is a large-gauge steel-mesh cube 
suspended within a steel-mesh cylindrical enclosure. A sprinkling of small 
rocks inside the piece -- sure to set up a racket as they slip from one resting 
place to another -- suggest the cylinder has a kinetic function. This piece has 
a rough-and-ready look, like a project a guy tinkers with endlessly in the 
basement. Particularly after you see how elegant Beckman can be, its 
awkwardness is refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
Carl H. Johansen also lives in New Mexico. Paintings from his "Black Mesa" 
series have the smart, knowing veneer that comes of slamming together bits and 
pieces of art history. 
</P>
<P>
In "Fascist's Dream," a big pretty-boy head lolls on its side as if broken off 
from an insipid statue. Tiny glittered hearts rise to an image that could have 
been painted by Charles Sheeler: a long red wall scooting back into the 
distance under a harsh, raking light. A glimpse of an O'Keeffe-like black cross 
set in a yellow glow; a small, busy painting of heads and flowers in harsh 
mockery of Picasso's style and an insouciant strip of hot pink spritzed with 
glitter complete this dizzy tour through a debauched and deadened brain. 
</P>
<P>
Bits of Navajo rug, Matisse nudes and Van Gogh peasants tromp through this 
series, but the overwhelming bogeyman to be exorcised here is late Picasso. His 
ghost wanders into a painting called "Love Like This," which is otherwise a 
more searching and quietly enigmatic affair. A twig of dried mullein looks like 
a sea monster, caged within the chalked yellow walls of a large rectangular 
space. Skinny, unravelled bits of carpet wander uncertainly. A painted pod-eyed 
monster with a sword does battle. And there's a pretty large untenanted area of 
black paint and flaked metal that gives these oddly evocative components room 
to breathe. (Natoli -- Ross Gallery, 2110 Broadway, to Aug. 5.) CATHY CURTIS

Public libraries have been checking out free videos for years. Now a 
video-store chain is doing the same. 
</P>
<P>
On July 4, Blockbuster Video's stores in the Los Angeles area began offering 
more than 40 informational titles for free check-out to anyone with a store 
membership (which is also free). 
</P>
<P>
Among the tapes available: "When Mom and Dad Break Up," Dr. Henry Heimlich's 
"Home First Aid," "Crime Prevention in the Home" and cassettes on alcoholism, 
back pain, CPR, drugs, nutrition, fire safety, smoking, self-defense and other 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
While there are no Blockbuster stores within the city limits of Los Angeles, 
the chain operates in Torrance, Hawthorne, Lakewood, Bellflower, Whittier, 
Arcadia, Ontario and several other communities in the area. Check your local 
yellow pages.

THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
"Cocoanuts" (MCA, $19.95) tumbled into movie theaters 60 years ago, 
revolutionizing film comedy. The first Marx Brothers picture, this very early 
talkie is also their most crudely made -- the zany musical comedy's almost as 
stagebound as the Broadway production from which it's derived. Creaky though 
the filming and some of the musical numbers may be, "Cocoanuts" is not to be 
missed by anyone who's a sucker for the Marxes' wild punches. Groucho, as the 
manager of a Florida resort hotel, holds the movie's classic auction, torments 
Margaret Dumont, is tormented himself by Chico in the "viaduct/why a duck" 
scene, and so (hilariously) on. 
</P>
<P>
Other old films out this week: 
</P>
<P>
"Diary of a Chambermaid" (Republic, $19.95, 1946), one of Jean Renoir's 
American films (remade more ironically by Luis Bunuel in 1964) features a 
script by co-star Burgess Meredith (Paulette Goddard plays the saucy servant); 
"The Key" (RCA/Columbia, $69.95, 1958), a World War II love story starring 
William Holden and Sophia Loren that's too somber and static despite the 
direction of the great Carol Reed; "The Glass Key" (MCA, $29.95, 1942), an 
atmospheric Dashiell Hammett adaptation with Alan Ladd and Veronica Lake; "A 
Dandy in Aspic" (RCA/Columbia, $69.95, 1968), a confusing spy melodrama with an 
interesting cast (including Mia Farrow and Lionel Stander) and completed by 
star Laurence Harvey after the death of director Anthony Mann, and "Affair in 
Trinidad" (RCA/Columbia, $69.95, 1952), which reunited Glenn Ford and Rita 
Hayworth, the stars of the great 1946 film noir "Gilda." 
</P>
<P>
More recent fare: 
</P>
<P>
"Dangerous Liaisons" (Warner, $89.95, R) could be subtitled "Dirty Rotten 
Scoundrels, Circa the Late 18th Century." Its own French rascals are played by 
Glenn Close and John Malkovich, and the sexual power games we're invited to 
laugh at include the rape of a 15-year-old girl. While the morality may be 
questionable, many critics praised this risky, risque and rakish 1988 
interpretation of the 200-year-old novel "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" -- or at 
least loved the costumes. 
</P>
<P>
"Talk Radio" (MCA, $89.95, R) is director Oliver Stone's and 
actor/writer/performance artist Eric Bogosian's plunge into the dark world of 
an abusive late-night shock-radio personality. 
</P>
<P>
"True Believer" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, R) stars James Woods as a cynical 
attorney who joins an idealistic young associate (Robert Downey Jr.) to 
investigate whether an innocent man may have been convicted of murder. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's Harry Crumb?" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, PG-13) offers John Candy as a 
bumbling detective. Critics found it's silliness unfunny and moaned once more 
over the great Candy's poor choice of scripts. 
</P>
<P>
"Physical Evidence" (Vestron, $89.98, R) has Burt Reynolds as a tough cop out 
to clear his name in a murder case and Theresa Russell as his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
"Minute Movie Masterpieces" (Rhino, $14.95, 30 minutes) takes 30 classic, 
public-domain films ("The Lady Vanishes," "It's a Wonderful Life," etc.) and 
speedily summarizes them. It's fun for a while, but since the alternating male 
and female narrators stick to real plots and add few comic asides, the approach 
isn't irreverently humorous in the way other "Fractured Flicker"-type cut-ups 
(like "Mad Movies") are. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Smith's Pregnancy Workout" (Media, $29.95, 90 minutes) was completed 
shortly before the popular exerciser's own child was delivered. "Hedda Hopper's 
Hollywood" (Republic, $19.95, 58 minutes) is a collection of vintage theatrical 
shorts in which the columnist invades the homes, workplaces and playgrounds of 
Bob Hope, Lucille Ball, Gary Cooper (who's seen shooting birds with Ernest 
Hemingway) and other stars. 
</P>
<P>
It's either great or poor timing, but Public Enemy -- one of the most 
controversial, political and musically powerful rap groups -- broke up noisily 
just two weeks before the release of its first video, "Public Enemy: Fight the 
Power -- Live" (CMV, $19.98, 60 minutes). Also new from CMV: "Branford 
Marsalis: Steep" ($19.98, 90 minutes), which documents the jazz saxophonist 
onstage and backstage. 
</P>
<P>
For the kids: Two new $14.95 additions to the Media/Fisher Price "Grimm's Fairy 
Tales" series are "Briar Rose" (25 minutes) a sleeping-beauty story, and "The 
Golden Goose" (22 minutes), all about a special bird that brings both joy and 
sorrow to some villagers. And "Columbia Pictures Cartoons Starring Mr. Magoo" 
(Magic Window, $19.95, 55 minutes) offers eight cartoons featuring the 
nearsighted comic character and the voice of the late Jim Backus. TERRY 
ATKINSON

Gann spending limit change and Prop. 98, a school finance measure. 
</P>
<P>
The state group also selected Carolyn Anderson, a teacher at Franklin 
Elementary School in Westminster, as winner of its Teacher Involvement Award 
for helping motivate her fellow teacher members in political activities. 
</P>

De Santis, who owns several businesses including pizza parlors in Santa Ana and 
Glendale, was elected to his post of the 100,000-member American Italian 
organization at the group's convention in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
He is a member of the order's Renaissance Lodge in Orange and is a UCLA

16-year history that the selection ended in a tie. 
</P>
<P>
"These two ladies epitomize the ideal Bowers Museum docent," said Joan Austin,

HOMELESS SHELTER CLOSES DUE TO LACK OF RESPONSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A shelter for mentally ill homeless women that opened three weeks ago has 
closed because too few clients used the facility, sponsors said. 
</P>
<P>
Kayes's Shelter, in the 200 block of East Amerige Avenue, had been the only 
shelter in the county designed specifically for mentally ill women who are 
homeless, said Donald Baumeister, director of Western Youth Services, a 
nonprofit service group that opened the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Under terms of a contract with the county, the group was to receive $15 a day 
for each bed occupied at the shelter. Shelter officials said at least 13 beds a 
night would have to be occupied at the 20-bed facility for it to break even 
financially. 
</P>
<P>
However, only five woman have used the shelter since it opened just less than a 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
Baumeister blamed the shelter's failure on several factors, including the warm 
weather and lack of advertising, and said his group will meet with county 
officials Monday to discuss conditions under which the shelter might reopen. 
</P>
<P>
Although the shelter was the only one specifically for homeless women, county 
officials said there are several other shelters in the county that serve the 
homeless mentally ill.

ARSON SUSPECTED IN FIRE AT AWNING COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Santa Ana fire investigators said Thursday that a $1-million fire last weekend 
that destroyed a Santa Ana awning firm was deliberately set. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chief James Montgomery said investigators have begun a criminal 
investigation of the fire at Pacific Awnings Corp., 4020 W. Carriage Drive, 
which was destroyed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't release any of the details of the investigation because it might 
jeopardize our investigation," Montgomery said.

MCINTOSH CENTER GIVEN FUNDS TO AID DISABLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An Anaheim agency has received a $45,000 grant from the state Public Utilities 
Commission to provide training for disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
The Dayle McIntosh Center is one of 32 agencies funded by the commission 
through $16.5 million in penalties paid by Pacific Bell for marketing abuses 
that affected consumers with limited experience, poor English-speaking 
abilities and low incomes. Of the $16.5 million, $5 million is being 
distributed to local agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The McIntosh Center will use the money to develop materials in Braille for the 
visually impaired and sign language for the deaf so that these people can be 
informed of new types of telecommunications equipment. Public presentations 
also will be made to the disabled community, Brenda Premo, executive director 
of the center, said.

MOLESTER IN DAY-CARE CASE FACES YEAR IN JAIL, PROBATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Howard Nokes, a former YWCA day-care center director, pleaded guilty 
Thursday to molesting nine boys in his care at facilities in East Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Nokes, 25, of Huntington Beach, faced up to 32 years in prison if he had been 
convicted on all 13 felony counts of child molestation. But the tentative 
agreement calls for a maximum sentence of a year in county jail and possibly 
five years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Ariadne Symons, who said she did not wish to 
subpoena Nokes' victims and "traumatize" them further by having them retell 
their experiences with Nokes, was satisfied with the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
"He acknowledged that he has a problem," Symons said. "And he admitted his 
guilt, and that's important to me because frequently the testimony of the young 
boys as witnesses is (a) greater trauma on them than the crime itself." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Nokes' attorney, Marri Derby, an Orange County deputy public 
defender, said her client is in a counseling program. 
</P>
<P>
"It's also pretty clear that his probation is going to include an intense 
treatment program," Derby said. 
</P>
<P>
Probation for convicted felons of sex crimes routinely includes mandatory 
registration with local police departments, no contact with any of the children 
involved and no contact with anyone under the age of 18 without adult 
supervision, Derby said. 
</P>
<P>
In Nokes' case, a prison term was not appropriate, according to both sides. 
While Nokes pleaded guilty to fondling the boys, the molestations did not 
involve rape, oral copulation or sodomy, Symons said. In addition, Nokes' 
defense attorney said that most of the molestations occurred while the children 
remained fully clothed. 
</P>
<P>
The molestations took place while Nokes supervised children at El Toro Marine 
School in East Irvine. Despite the name, the school is not connected to El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station, but enrolls many children whose parents work at the 
air station. 
</P>
<P>
Nokes was a director of a YWCA program in charge of child-care supervision at 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
The molestations occurred from November, 1988, through April, 1989. Nokes was 
arrested April 3, after one of the parents contacted the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department and reported the sexual molestations. 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorney Derby said Nokes admitted to touching the boys, whose average 
age was 10. Two of the children said they were fondled underneath their 
clothing, while the others said they were fondled outside their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"He has always admitted his responsibility," Symons said. "This is not a man 
who should go to jail for 32 years." 
</P>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Myron S. Brown has scheduled a Sept. 6 sentencing for 
Nokes.

JET SKI OWNERS SAY NEWPORT'S CURB ACTS AS BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY ENG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Newport Beach ordinance that went into effect Thursday to keep jet skiers 
away from swimmers and surfers has all but barred the sport from the city's 
waters, enthusiasts said. 
</P>
<P>
Jet skiers have rarely zipped out to the ocean from Newport Beach since the 
ordinance was passed by the City Council last month, lifeguards said. 
</P>
<P>
"They haven't been here for weeks," said Capt. Ron Johnson of Newport Beach's 
Marine Department. "They've gone someplace else." 
</P>
<P>
According to the ordinance, jet ski operators cannot launch from the beach. 
Launchings are allowed only from the Newport Dunes area, which is north of the 
lower bay. Until they reach the ocean, jet skiers must limit their speed to 5 
m.p.h, making the average time to reach the waves about 40 minutes, jet skiers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Violation of the ordinance is a misdemeanor, said David Harshbarger, director 
of Newport Beach's Marine Department. 
</P>
<P>
Seal Beach, Laguna Beach, and Long Beach have similar jet ski restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Designed to Prevent Injuries 
</P>
<P>
Although Newport Beach has had no reports of swimmers or surfers injured by jet 
skis, which resemble snowmobiles and can move at about 30 m.p.h., council 
members and marine officials said the ordinance will prevent any injuries. 
</P>
<P>
But jet ski supporters said the ordinance is much too strict and limits their 
ocean access. 
</P>
<P>
"It's biased and unfair," said Gene Kraus, a Newport Beach resident and a jet 
ski enthusiast. "The water is for all of us, not for a selected few." 
</P>
<P>
Because of the law, Kraus said, he cannot launch his jet ski from his 
oceanfront home. Instead, he must drive to Newport Dunes, then go through the 
bay at 5 m.p.h. to reach the ocean, and then have just five or 10 minutes 
before he must return or run out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
Jet ski people said they will go somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would anybody want to jet ski in Newport Beach anymore?" asked Brent 
Barnes, the owner of Costa Mesa-based Jet Sports. "This cuts it for Newport. 
Nobody wants to spend all that time getting to the ocean and then running out 
of gas." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Stricklin, a national jet ski champion from Downey, said the ordinance 
penalizes operators who have obeyed state law prohibiting jet skiers from going 
within 200 feet of a swimmer at speeds above 5 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting shut down from more and more places," he said. "There's hardly 
enough places in Southern California where you can launch off and go straight 
to the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
Although jet skis have been around for several years, the sport is still 
considered relatively new, said Catherine Martin, spokeswoman for Irvine-based 
Kawasaki Motors Corp. USA and for the International Jet Ski Boating Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"People are not familiar with it, and the immediate reaction is to ban it," 
Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Dave Milewski said jet skiers are turning to other 
waters, including Dana Point, where the launch point is about five minutes from 
the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
However, Milewski said, local residents there have been complaining about the 
noise from jet skis.

MATER DEI GOALIE AMMANN TO PLAY SOCCER FOR TITANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mike Ammann, a graduate of Mater Dei High School, has signed a letter of intent 
to play soccer at Cal State Fullerton, the school announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Ammann, a goalie, was an All-Southern Section selection in soccer last season. 
He also was a kicker for the Monarch football team. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike is one of the best soccer goalkeepers to ever come out of Orange County 
and one of the top prospects to ever sign with Cal State Fullerton," Fullerton 
Coach Al Mistri said. "We are very excited to have him as part of the team." 
</P>
<P>
Ammann's brother, Bob, played at Fullerton from 1983-86. He was a first-team 
All-Pacific Coast Athletic Assn. selection in 1986, when Fullerton won the 
conference title. 
</P>
<P>
"Soccer is my number one sport, so that's why I decided to play at Cal State 
Fullerton," Ammann said.

IRVINE FIRM TO ENTER MARKET WITH $5-MILLION SERVICE FACILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An Irvine aircraft maintenance firm is trying to break into a burgeoning new 
market by building a $5-million facility near Mojave to recondition aging 
commercial aircraft, including jumbo jets, company officials announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for a new and emerging industry. . . . We call it the 
independent air-transport maintenance industry," said W.R. Laidlaw, founder and 
chief executive officer of Aerotest Inc., which has made a modest living by 
servicing smaller corporate jets. 
</P>
<P>
The Mojave plant will be the first independent airframe repair facility in 
California and only the fourth in the nation capable of major, nose-to-tail 
overhauls of aging jumbo jets, company officials said. Many airlines operate 
their own modernizing facilities, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Aerotest officials declined to say if the firm had signed up any customers for 
its new plant, but they said they have had talks with major airlines and cargo 
carriers. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes more sense . . . to service the needs of a major air carrier or 
carrier family," said Laidlaw, rather than work on several types of aircraft 
for different customers. 
</P>
<P>
Aerotest estimated that demand for rebuilding and modernizing the bodies of 
aging aircraft will increase dramatically in coming years as the number of jet 
transport planes, both passenger and cargo, 20 or more years old rises from 
2,440 in 1988 to 5,731 in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
Coupled with an expected doubling in demand for jet-transport service, company 
officials said they expect the number of man-hours required each year to 
maintain the world's jet fleet will rise from 89 million in 1988 to 189 million 
by the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Airlines and cargo businesses will not be able to keep up with the demand to 
maintain and refit their airplanes, Laidlaw said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like it will be a growing business," said Edward J. Starkman, an 
airline industry analyst for PaineWebber Inc. in New York. "You've got a 
capacity pinch in this (aircraft maintenance) business. To the extent they can 
offer a first-rate, certificated program to do this sort of work, it makes 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
Attending Aerotest's Capitol Hill press conference Thursday morning were 
several members of Congress, including Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport 
Beach), and officials of the Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses 
aircraft repair and maintenance personnel and facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"What Aerotest is doing in California is of great importance," Cox said. "I'm 
very appreciative that investors, management, qualified people in the private 
sector are turning their attention to this problem." 
</P>
<P>
Aerotest last month broke ground for a 125,000-square-foot facility, including 
a 75,000-square-foot hangar, at the Mojave airport as the first phase of a 
planned $30-million jet-reconditioning facility. Eventually, the company plans 
to build six hangars and other buildings, totaling 500,000 square feet, on a 
39-acre site. 
</P>
<P>
The private company, which employs about 200 at existing facilities in Mojave, 
Van Nuys and Irvine, was formed in 1986 and has annual revenue of about $23 
million, said Iain Glendinning, the company's president. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the company has concentrated almost exclusively on the maintenance and 
finishing of corporate jets, primarily Gulf Stream aircraft. Last year it 
purchased Western Commander, which operates a Van Nuys aviation services firm 
called the Jet Center. 
</P>
<P>
Glendinning cited three other U.S. firms that either have or are about to 
develop the capability to modernize airframes of jumbo jets. They are the Dee 
Howard Co., which operates a facility in San Antonio, Tex.; Evergreen 
International Aviation, Inc., which owns the Evergreen Air Center in Marana, 
Ariz.; and Tramco Inc. in Everett, Wash.

MAVERICK ITALIAN STIRS UP THE SOYBEAN FUTURES MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ROME 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The late Serafino Ferruzzi made his fortune helping to feed starving postwar 
Italy. His son-in-law, Raul Gardini, has wider ambitions and they are having 
repercussions on one of the world's busiest commodities markets. 
</P>
<P>
Gardini's company, Ferruzzi Finanziara S.p.A., was the center of attention this 
week as the reported target of an emergency order by the Chicago Board of Trade 
to break up an alleged attempt to corner the soybean market. 
</P>
<P>
The company denied that it had done anything wrong and protested the order -- 
which required liquidation of large positions in the market's July soybean 
contract -- saying it was only trying to satisfy its export commitments. 
</P>
<P>
Since taking over the Ravenna-based company nine years ago, Gardini has turned 
the Ferruzzi food group into Western Europe's biggest grain exporter and 
Italy's second-largest private industrial concern after Fiat. 
</P>
<P>
If Giovanni Agnelli, head of the Fiat auto empire, is Italy's industrial king, 
then the handsome, silver-haired Gardini may be the crown prince. 
</P>
<P>
But while Agnelli was born into wealth, Italy's financial press frequently 
reminds Gardini of his middle-class farming origins and his rough-and-tumble 
board-room style. 
</P>
<P>
While Agnelli, who holds a law degree, is reverently referred to as the 
"Avvocato" (lawyer), Gardini has been nicknamed "Il Contadino" (the peasant). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
New Breed of Entrepreneur 
</P>
<P>
Gardini has made a number of bold moves since he became head of the Ferruzzi 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
The most important was his 1987 takeover of the Montedison chemical company, a 
move that consolidated Ferruzzi's power as Italy's second-largest private 
business group. 
</P>
<P>
Italy's financial press takes pride in describing Gardini as one of the new 
breed of entrepreneurs who look beyond Italy's borders and are not afraid of a 
corporate fight. 
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old Gardini, an avid outdoorsman and hunter who owns a 500-year-old 
palace on Venice's Grand Canal, is equally proud of his roots as a farmer. 
</P>
<P>
He was born in Ravenna, attended an agricultural school and went to work for 
Ferruzzi. In 1957, he married Ferruzzi's daughter, Ida. 
</P>
<P>
Since becoming chairman in 1980, Gardini has launched a major expansion and the 
group now owns 2.5 million acres of land distributed over three continents. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps his boldest move was his raid on Montedison, one of the 10 largest 
chemical companies in the world but saddled with debt and aging plants that 
were accused of being some of Italy's worst polluters.

'SONGS': FAMILY, PLAY IN CONFLICT

<TEXT>
<P>
The title of Murray Schisgal's new play, "The Songs of War" (at the indoor Gem 
Theatre of the Grove Shakespeare Festival), appears to have two meanings. 
</P>
<P>
It refers to the patriotic ditties and other American pop tunes from the eras 
of the two World Wars, heard throughout the show. But it also refers to the 
relentlessly argumentative refrains that were the skirmishes in the war between 
Saul and Bertha Sakowitz, the unhappily married parents of our narrator, Calvin 
Saks. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, this is another Jewish-family-gone-sour play. Although the songs signal a 
nostalgic look back at the era of the narrator's youth, the nostalgia seems 
fraudulent. Schisgal doesn't show us a single moment when these people were 
functioning as a happy family. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a muddle. Schisgal is working at cross-purposes with himself. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble begins with the role of the narrator. Calvin tells us about his 
teen years from the perspective of himself at 60. Perhaps Schisgal wanted to 
avoid charges of imitating Neil Simon, whose trilogy about his youth in a 
similar time and place ("Brighton Beach Memoirs," "Biloxi Blues," "Broadway 
Bound") was told from the perspective of a young man who had recently lived 
through the events he describes. 
</P>
<P>
There is no other reason to present Calvin at such an advanced age, and there 
is a big reason not to do so. Calvin's obsessive search to discover which 
parent was more responsible for his unhappy youth is something you would expect 
from a relatively young man. By the age of 60, most people have come to terms 
with such issues -- especially when, as in Calvin's case, the answer is so 
obvious: Both parents were responsible, and so was the culture in which they 
were raised. Next subject, please. It's petty for a 60-year-old to devote a lot 
of time to agonizing over which parent he can blame most intensely for his 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
But Schisgal compounds this basic miscalculation by making it almost impossible 
for us to see the kid within this 60-year-old. Calvin is dressed in white tie 
and tails. While this makes him look dapper during the show's musical 
interludes, it makes him look ridiculous when he plays the kitchen-sink scenes 
from his youth. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of Steeve Arlen to play Calvin makes matters even worse. Arlen 
was born in Wales, and he sounds like it. Picture a 60-year-old man with a 
Welsh accent, wearing white tie, playing a 16-year-old kid from Brooklyn. It's 
bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Schisgal was going for a light absurdist effect. There are occasional 
snatches of dialogue -- when the parents' bickering breaks into a battle of 
nursery rhymes, for example -- that would also indicate this. But this use of 
stylization is inconsistent and feels arbitrary. 
</P>
<P>
The same can be said for the songs themselves, the likes of "K-K-K-Katy," 
"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree," "Der Fuhrer's Face," "Remember Pearl Harbor" 
and a few from the World War I era (Calvin's father was a veteran of the Great 
War). 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally they serve the story, as when Calvin's embittered mother 
(full-throated Connie Danese), anxious about the possibility of an affair with 
a neighbor, Roy (Raymond Lynch), sings "My Buddy" straight from the heart at a 
war rally. But more often the songs seem designed primarily to give the actors 
a chance to sing and dance. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, they also set the mood for the period, but two or three of them 
could have done that, while there are a dozen or so in the show. Maybe the 
sunny optimism of the era, as heard in its music, is supposed to be in ironic 
contrast to the domestic squabbles between Saul and Bertha. But without more 
diligent work connecting the story to the songs, the irony dissipates. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, this couple's marital problems transcend the period. These two 
would have been at each other's throats in any era (and indeed, we get glimpses 
of them still at odds in their old age). 
</P>
<P>
Except for Arlen, director Jerome Guardino's cast is at home in these somewhat 
stereotyped roles. Paul Keith plays the tormented Saul with a hangdog look that 
is transformed when he remembers his single days in Paris, and Juliet Landau is 
winsome as Calvin's frail but plucky sister. 
</P>
<P>
Hale Porter plays Zada (Calvin's grandfather), chilly and remote. We're told 
that Zada killed pigeons and served them as appetizers at a wedding. We 
half-believe it. 
</P>
<P>
The set design, by Christa Bartels, is meant to evoke a rehearsal room rather 
than a real Brooklyn household. Schisgal obviously wants to tell his story 
outside the boundaries of realism. But he hasn't figured out how to do it yet. 
</P>

'MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER' TO HAVE LONDON REVIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT WOLF, Associated Press 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The rehearsal room fills with British accents as actors break for lunch after 
spending a recent morning trying to sound as American as apple pie. 
</P>
<P>
It's all in a day's work at the Royal Shakespeare Company, which is reviving 
the classic 1939 American comedy "The Man Who Came to Dinner," by George S. 
Kaufman and Moss Hart. 
</P>
<P>
The RSC had a 1979 hit with Trevor Nunn's production of Kaufman and Hart's 
"Once in a Lifetime," which went on to a commercial West End run. 
</P>
<P>
"The Man Who Came to Dinner" opens at the Barbican Theater on July 20, and runs 
in repertory through September 12. 
</P>
<P>
"This play is superlatively well put together. With any luck, it's one of those 
wonderful comic machines," said John Wood, the Englishman who plays the 
irascible dinner guest, Sheridan Whiteside. 
</P>
<P>
The supporting cast includes such RSC stalwarts as Richard Haddon Haines and 
Marjorie Yates as Whiteside's hosts, the Stanleys, and Ralph Fiennes as the 
local newspaperman, Bert Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
Whiteside, a wicked caricature of the celebrated wit and theater critic 
Alexander Woollcott, is a New York radio celebrity who ends up housebound with 
an Ohio family when a dinner invitation becomes a comedy of misadventures. 
</P>
<P>
Monty Woolley originated the part in New York and in the 1941 film, and Robert 
Morley was its first London star. Morley's son, theater critic Sheridan Morley, 
was born that year, and was named after Sheridan Whiteside. 
</P>
<P>
The play is ripe with Whiteside's acid-tongued lines. 
</P>
<P>
Whiteside in introducing his secretary to Bert Jefferson: "This aging 
debutante, Mr. Jefferson, I retain in my employ only because she is the sole 
support of her two-headed brother." 
</P>
<P>
The play was most recently seen in New York in 1980 at Circle in the Square, 
directed by and starring Ellis Rabb. 
</P>
<P>
The latest revival marks the RSC directing debut of Broadway veteran Gene Saks, 
who is most often associated with the plays of Neil Simon. His staging of 
Simon's farce, "Rumors," is a current Broadway hit. 
</P>
<P>
Saks had only worked in London once before, restaging his Broadway musical hit 
"I Love My Wife" for the West End, when the RSC approached him. 
</P>
<P>
"I found this offer very flattering," said Saks in an interview. "They said, 
'We wanted an American to do it and who knows more about American comedy than 
you do?' I said, 'Well, now I'll have to do it."' 
</P>
<P>
Saks came to London in March to meet with John Wood, whom he knew socially 
during Wood's longtime residency in New York starring in "Deathtrap," 
"Travesties" and "Amadeus." 
</P>
<P>
He called Wood "a very special, tremendously talented and experienced actor who 
can teach anybody a lot." 
</P>
<P>
Wood stars as Prospero in "The Tempest" at the RSC, and will play the doomed 
Halvard Solness in Henrik Ibsen's "The Master Builder," opening there Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
The actor said he responded with some diffidence to the offer to play 
Whiteside, adding that the role's unusual demands require a masseur. 
</P>
<P>
Whiteside is wheelchair-bound for much of the play, having slipped and broken 
his hip. "This is lower back pain on an operatic scale," said Wood. 
</P>
<P>
Saks liked the lesser pressures and diminished intensity of working at the RSC, 
where shows are guaranteed a run, as opposed to New York, where they can close 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm always shocked at the reaction of the (New York) press and of some of the 
public," said Saks, who, besides his string of Neil Simon hits, directed two 
recent Broadway flops: Bob Larbey's play "A Month of Sundays," and the musical 
"Rags." 
</P>
<P>
"I want to say, 'It's after all only a play. If you didn't like it, that's your 
prerogative, but let's go on to the next one."' 
</P>
<P>
Instead, New York failures are, he said, "left like a street accident with 
blood all over them." 
</P>
<P>
The RSC reminded Saks of the Actors' Studio, where he trained as an actor in 
the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a real revolution against phony, traditional acting," he said. "They 
all seem to want to be truthful and get underneath things, the same as good 
actors are doing in America. 
</P>
<P>
"There's less and less difference between the two."

PANEL PLANS FUND-RAISER FOR THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Backers of a 1,500-seat performing arts center in Mission Viejo are moving 
forward with plans for a fund-raising event and a broadening of focus to the 
entire south county area. 
</P>
<P>
More than 20 members of an advisory board for the theater met for the first 
time Wednesday, laying the groundwork for the fund-raiser Oct. 14 at the 
Mission Viejo Mall, according to board chairman Christian W. Keena, who also 
serves as mayor pro tem of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Keena said the group hopes to raise $100,000 at the event for a feasibility 
study and preliminary drawings for the theater, which the board would like to 
see located on the campus of Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
With representatives on the advisory board from the college, the Mission Viejo 
and Rancho Santa Margarita companies and the cities of San Juan Capistrano, 
Dana Point and San Clemente, Keena said, the project is becoming regional, 
rather than municipal. "The college," he said, "has become the focal point for 
the performing arts in south county." 
</P>
<P>
The DeBartolo Corp., which owns the shopping center, and the Mission Viejo Co. 
have contributed cash and staff support for the fund-raiser, which will 
celebrate the mall's 10th anniversary, Keena said. Tickets for the event, which 
includes food and entertainment, begin at $25. MARK I. PINSKY

NATIVE NEW ENGLANDER TESTS THE CHOWDER IN RED, WHITE AND SAN CLEMENTE STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sunday last was a glorious, sun-drenched day on the San Clemente Pier, and one 
that I will not soon forget. That was the day, you see, I was asked to judge 
the second annual Fiesta Chowder cook-off in conjunction with the San Clemente 
Ocean Festival. 
</P>
<P>
Now, I am a native New Englander, and we native New Englanders are plenty 
particular when it comes to our chowders. To most of us, the ideal chowder has 
plenty of cream, fresh clams, diced potato, sweet butter, salt, pepper, a 
little cornstarch and maybe even some bacon if we are feeling radical. Few 
Bostonians would even point their noses at the red chowders, and suffering the 
indignities of pasty white pretenders at fish frys, church suppers and ersatz 
seafood restaurants away from New England takes all the self-discipline and 
good manners we can muster. 
</P>
<P>
With all due respect to the good people of San Clemente, I must report that 
despite the fun, Sunday was indeed a stern test of character. Because, as one 
of the other judges so aptly noted midway through the tasting, "some of these 
chowders are enough to gag a maggot." 
</P>
<P>
So, after shuffling through the throngs on the pier, meeting King Neptune, 
ogling a mermaid and observing hundreds of helium balloons, little boys with 
fishing poles and apparently happy chowder tasters with their plastic tasting 
cups, there we were at the judging stand ready to begin. 
</P>
<P>
The sponsors handed us our white chefs hats and aprons, set out the numbered 
containers, plastic spoons and the paper sheets we were to use for evaluation, 
marked with numerical scales for color, texture, and aroma. Next to us were 
some trophies ready to be handed out. The lids were lifted and we began. 
</P>
<P>
I never knew chowders could come in so many varieties. Some had shrimp and 
strands of celery. Others had Cajun spices and mussels. Some were creamy and 
yellow. Others were oily and brown. Many of the red chowders were full of fiery 
peppers and chunks of tomato. Even more of the white chowders had uncooked 
potatoes floating on the surface. In the end I had to douse my mouth with 
Perrier and oyster crackers to restore my palate. When the smoke cleared away, 
these were the results: 
</P>
<P>
Best restaurant New England-style chowder went to Rose and Crown in San 
Clemente. Best restaurant Manhattan-style chowder went to Sonny's Pizza in San 
Clemente. Best individual (non-restaurant) New England-style chowder went to 
the Lusk Co. in San Clemente. Best individual Manhattan-style chowder went to 
Ann Raymond in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
There was no award for sportsmanlike conduct, but maybe they will put that one 
in next year. For judges.

WHEN A PET DIES; 
</P>
<P>
OWNER'S GRIEF FOR AN ANIMAL IS USUALLY A LONELY, MISUNDERSTOOD EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Cats are proud to the end. So, as most of them will do, Gatita crawled off to 
hide to await death. 
</P>
<P>
But her owner could not bear to let Gatita spend her final hours alone. "I 
curled up beside her on the floor, and stayed with her all night," Jeannine 
Mackin-Ocampo said, breaking into tears at the memory. "She always slept on the 
foot of my bed. I didn't want for us to be apart on her last night." 
</P>
<P>
The next day Mackin-Ocampo, 31, would have to say goodby to her companion of 14 
years. Old age had taken its toll; Gatita suffered irreparable kidney failure, 
and the veterinarian recommended euthanasia. 
</P>
<P>
Pet lovers are hopeful to the end. Even though Mackin-Ocampo intellectually 
accepted the inevitable, emotionally she did not. 
</P>
<P>
"Gatita woke up around midnight and started eating, and I thought, 'She's doing 
better,' " said the Costa Mesa resident. "I was praying for a sign that she'd 
be OK, that there would be a change for the better." 
</P>
<P>
But there was no miracle. 
</P>
<P>
Gatita's death last February came at an already difficult time for 
Mackin-Ocampo. Only weeks before, she had separated from her husband, moved 
from Los Angeles to Orange County and started a new job. 
</P>
<P>
"My whole life was changing," she said. "I was so afraid of losing Gatita. She 
represented 14 years of my life. I got her when I was 18; I had her through 
college, I had her through several relationships, I had her through my marriage 
and separation. She was my stabilizing force. 
</P>
<P>
"When the vet told me that I had to put her to sleep, I was very upset. But I 
had to go to work that week, although the cat was all that mattered to me. I 
couldn't call in sick -- I'd just started my job, and I was still on 
probation," said Mackin-Ocampo, a rehabilitation therapist. 
</P>
<P>
After losing her cat, she was overcome by depression -- the depths of which 
surprised her. "My body felt tied in knots," she said. "I cried every time I 
touched something of Gatita's to put it away. I never realized the impact her 
death would have on me." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Mackin-Ocampo had been in counseling since the dissolution of her 
marriage. "I was glad that I was dealing with the loss of my husband so that it 
would not be magnified by the loss of my cat," she said. "Otherwise, I might 
have gone off the deep end." 
</P>
<P>
Mackin-Ocampo's profound grief is more common than those who are less attached 
to animals might imagine. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people have a relationship with their pets that is every bit as 
significant as any human relationship they have," said Danna Olson, a Carlsbad 
veterinarian who conducts an ongoing support group for bereaved pet lovers. 
</P>
<P>
"The process of grieving a pet's death is very similar to that of grieving a 
family member's death; the only difference is that the intense stage of grief 
usually doesn't last as long." 
</P>
<P>
Losing a pet can be a much more lonely experience than the loss of a relative. 
When a person suffers a family death, friends and co-workers react with 
telephone calls, flowers and cards. But that same sympathetic network often 
fails to grasp the trauma of a pet's death. 
</P>
<P>
"People don't get the same emotional support after losing a pet," said Costa 
Mesa veterinarian Joel Pasco. "They're out there in limbo. They can go into a 
severe depression, yet friends don't take it seriously." 
</P>
<P>
"If your spouse dies, you can call in sick to work and you have a lot of 
sympathy," said San Diego psychotherapist Lorri Greene, who co-sponsors with 
Olson a pet bereavement support group. 
</P>
<P>
"If your cat dies and you call in sick, you're faced with a lot of snickering 
and, 'Oh, geez, it was only a cat -- why don't you go to the pound and pick up 
another cat?' Your feelings are totally discounted." 
</P>
<P>
Nick Vlahos didn't tell just anybody about the funeral service that his family 
held for its poodle, Tasha. "People would think this was a loony house," said 
the Anaheim Hills aerospace scientist. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, Linda, and their two daughters read passages out of the Bible 
before burying Tasha in a silk-lined coffin. 
</P>
<P>
"We did for Tasha whatever we would have done for a human," Vlahos said. "I 
loved Tasha just like I love my kids, absolutely. She was our first baby." The 
dog was 15 years old when she died last October; his children, Angela and 
Valerie, are 11 and 13. 
</P>
<P>
"I cried for two months solid after Tasha died," said Linda Vlahos, a flight 
attendant. "Not a day goes by that I don't think about her." 
</P>
<P>
Animalphiles to the core, the Vlahoses have been known to cancel vacation plans 
for the sake of a convalescing pet. And, as far as Nick Vlahos is concerned, 
four-legged creatures "can do no wrong." 
</P>
<P>
"Our cat knocked pieces off Dad's marble chess set and broke them. If I had 
done that, I would have been grounded for a month, but he didn't even yell at 
the cat," said Valerie. 
</P>
<P>
"When the cat jumped on the table and knocked off an expensive vase, Mr. Vlahos 
here said it was my fault for putting the vase in the cat's way," his wife 
added with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
As well as Tasha's funeral ceremony, the Vlahos' do not broadcast that they 
currently are spending thousands of dollars on cancer treatments for their dog, 
Mousee. "People would say, 'Are you crazy?' " Vlahos said. "But this is my 
family, and the dog is a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Mousee's veterinarian, Justin Quecke, must deal with sorrowful pet owners on a 
daily basis. "Ninety-nine percent of my patients are terminal," said the 
Anaheim veterinarian, who specializes in cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Quecke constantly faces the tough task of advising clients that their pets be 
put to sleep. "The bottom line is the animal's quality of life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But euthanasia can cause yet another dimension of grief. "We don't (do this) to 
people; we don't take responsibility for letting them live or die," Olson 
pointed out. "So even when you've accepted that euthanasia is the decent thing 
to do for your pet, in your gut you feel like a rat." 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how much of a blessing you know that (euthanasia) is, it's still 
hard," concurred Melinda Bungartz, 35, a Costa Mesa teacher. "I prayed that I 
would not have to make that choice." 
</P>
<P>
The day before her ailing golden retriever, Ashley, was to be put to sleep, 
Bungartz picked up the 13-year-old dog from the animal hospital for one last 
night together. 
</P>
<P>
"I lit a fire and slept with her in the living room," Bungartz said. "The next 
morning I took her by a longtime girlfriend's house and said, 'I've got 
somebody for you to say goodby to.' We played with Ashley for a while on the 
front lawn, then I took her to the vet." 
</P>
<P>
Guilt -- whether it be from determining to destroy the animal or from some 
unfounded regrets about neglect -- is a common side effect of grief, according 
to the experts. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell people not to put themselves through those horrible 'if onlys' -- 'if 
only I had run the dog more often it wouldn't have had heart problems,' 'if 
only I had groomed the dog more often I would have found the lump sooner and 
saved it from cancer,' " said Diane Kelley, a Los Angeles-based psychotherapist 
who specializes in pet bereavement. 
</P>
<P>
Seven years after the death of her cocker spaniel, Jennifer Rebuldela still 
blames herself. At the age of 2, Kelly escaped the back yard and was hit by a 
car. He survived that incident, but one leg required amputation. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt really bad, like it was my fault," said Rebuldela, 34, a personnel 
director in Irvine. "I could have prevented it if I had been more careful about 
locking the gate." 
</P>
<P>
Not long afterward, Kelly died from a parasite infection unrelated to the 
accident. To this day, Rebuldela has not gotten another pet -- partly out of 
self-punishment for, in her view, "irresponsibility," and partly to avoid 
reliving a similar tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd really be sad if something like that happened again," she said. "I loved 
Kelly so much; even now it makes me sad to think of him." 
</P>
<P>
Rebuldela recently married and, now that she feels "more settled down," is 
considering another pet. Still, though, her words are laced with doubt and 
guilt. "I just wasn't responsible enough," she reiterated -- her voice 
trembling, as if Kelly died only yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
Before Kelly's death, Rebuldela lost both her father and her brother. "My 
feelings (about Kelly) reminded me of that loss -- how you can't get them 
back," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Oftentimes, the death of a pet can trigger other things," Greene said. "If you 
have a relative who died, the loss of a pet can bring it all up again. It's a 
double whammy -- you're grieving not only the pet, but also the relative." 
</P>
<P>
For an elderly person whose spouse has died, a once-shared pet "can be the last 
vestige of connection with the deceased husband or wife," Quecke said. 
"Frequently, they experience a strong feeling of panic." 
</P>
<P>
Also, a pet is often the main source of companionship for a widowed person. "It 
gives them another living thing in the house," Greene said. 
</P>
<P>
"Oscar was like family," Ouida Richardson, 70, said of her silky terrier who 
died last month. "I had a terrible time when he passed away." 
</P>
<P>
Richardson's son presented her with Oscar 15 years ago, after the death of her 
husband. "We'd always had dogs around when my son was growing up, but this was 
the first dog I had to myself," said the Anaheim resident. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, Richardson said, "I forget Oscar died. I'll go to put my feet on 
the floor after lying on the couch, and I'll look to see if he's in the way. 
Oh, my goodness, the house feels empty." 
</P>
<P>
"You're not going crazy if you still hear your cat scratching at the door for a 
while after its death," said Greene. "That's a normal manifestation of the 
denial stage of grieving." 
</P>
<P>
Acquiring a new animal can ease the pain of losing a tried and true animal. Bob 
Lay, 40, an officer with the Anaheim Police Department, welcomed another "work 
dog" into his house after the recent death of his German shepherd -- a 
colleague as well as a pet. 
</P>
<P>
"It helped fill the emptiness," he said. "You get very attached to these dogs. 
They ride with you in your car, work with you eight hours a day, go home with 
you. You're constantly working and playing with them. When they go, it's a big 
void in your life." 
</P>
<P>
However, pet mourners should guard against expecting a newcomer to be a replica 
of the original, therapists warn. "I suggest that people get another pet only 
after they've gone through the grieving process and they do not see the new 
animal as a replacement," Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a client who went out and got an identical beagle the day after his dog 
died," Greene said. "But the second beagle certainly didn't have the same 
personality as the first; the poor dog didn't stand a chance. This person 
eventually took him back to the pound because he didn't measure up." 
</P>
<P>
Mackin-Ocampo and Bungartz have adopted new pets, both with happy results. 
Bungartz's year-old puppy, Molly, is her deceased dog's great granddaughter. 
"It's like having a little bit of Ashley around," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For those who have a friend grieving a pet's death, Olson has some advice: 
"Whatever you do, don't say, 'It was only an animal.' It was not 'only an 
animal.' It was a special animal."DR, RICHARD MILHOLLAND

STYLE: BIKER WEAR FOR THOSE BORN TO BE IN STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN NEWELL YOUNG, Karen Newell Young is a regular contributor to Orange 
County Life. 
</P>

<P>
She's a motorcycle mama who rarely rides a motorbike. Still, even without her 
back to the wind, Ruth West comes about as close to the biker's life as a 
desk-bound artist can. 
</P>
<P>
As a free-lance fashion designer for a company that supplies clothing and gear 
to the motorcycle industry, West makes her own hours -- without bosses or time 
clocks -- creating designs for jackets, full-body suits, hats, gloves, pants 
and patches. The clothes are sold to such firms as Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki and 
Harley Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
A middle-aged mother of two ("Say I'm over 40; I always knock about 10 years 
off"), West began designing sportswear in 1965 after graduating from 
Philadelphia's Moore School of Art in fashion design. She started her career by 
launching her own ski wear design company, called Swing West. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, when day-glo colors and psychedelic designs began seeping into 
Middle America, West started creating ski outfits in bold, whimsical prints, 
which were featured in several fashion publications, including Women's Wear 
Daily. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where I really made my name, with wild ski overalls and graphic 
designs," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after she was asked by Ocean Pacific, an active-sportswear company based 
in Orange County, to develop a line of swimwear, outer-wear and sweaters. She 
has also designed sportswear for Adidas, Sears, Hobie and Union Bay. And she 
designs clothes for Germany's Hein Gericke line, imported by Intersport, which 
is the company that buys and distributes all of her motorcycle fashions. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those fashions may soon be seen in a retail store; Hein Gericke plans 
to open a shop called Speedwear in Orange County this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Switching from ski and surf wear to clothing for bikers was not a huge leap, 
West says. 
</P>
<P>
"I basically translated the ski look into motorcycle clothes," she says. "It 
was easy to take my experience with stretch fabrics and combine them with 
leather." 
</P>
<P>
West, who lives in Newport Beach, now concentrates mostly on motorcycle 
clothes. Her business is called Wild Wild West, and her ideas are hatched in a 
studio overlooking Newport Bay on Balboa Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Why motorcycle fashions? 
</P>
<P>
"Because nobody else is doing it," she says, pulling sketches out of a giant 
portfolio. "There are a lot of things I'd like to do. I'd like to be able to 
use some of the real forward fashion leathers, pearlized finishes, patent 
leather trims, more hardware, stretch fabrics and texture, more creative use of 
studs." 
</P>
<P>
West's styles are not of the outlaw variety: She doesn't sprinkle her designs 
with skulls and snakes or fringe the sleeves. Most of her pieces are 
traditional, long-sleeved leather jackets designed for comfort and speed. 
They're stylish and well-made in soft leathers and sturdy fabrics, the kind of 
no-nonsense clothes favored by serious riders. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some of her tops and pants sport wild colors sprinkled with silver 
studs. And although her clothes are sold exclusively through motorcycle 
dealerships, she envisions a day when biker styles hit the fashion big time and 
are merchandised in boutiques and department stores. 
</P>
<P>
With long, pink fingernails flying, she pulls out some of her jacket designs 
with bold graphics, electric colors and shimmering zippers. There is a lot of 
room to grow, she says, shaking her blonde hair to reveal large black-hoop 
earrings. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it, you're selling mostly to the Midwest, and those people are not 
very fashion-conscious," she adds. "I would love to design for people out here 
that ride for the style of it. That's a whole area that nobody's touched." 
</P>
<P>
West, who admits she likes to ride but doesn't own a bike, is drawn to the 
motorcycle world not only by the creative possibilities it offers her, but also 
by the freedom it symbolizes. She admires the independence of the biker's life 
-- it's the kind of niche she's carved out in her career. 
</P>
<P>
"I like my independence and individuality. I have a hard time working 9 to 5 at 
anything. I'd just as soon work in the middle of the night to get time off 
during the day." 
</P>
<P>
Like many motorcycle riders, West has had to negotiate some tricky byways. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been tough," she says. "You're always promoting yourself. You always have 
to worry about one job ending and filling the gap with another right away. It's 
the nature of this business. Even if you're full time, if the business falls on 
hard times, the designers are the first ones out the door." 
</P>
<P>
Another pitfall is age bias, she adds. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've been in the business for as long as I have you're competing with 
very young people, right out of school, who don't cost a lot. Employers don't 
realize the ones in the business are not making the mistakes the new ones are 
making; they already made them and have learned from them. There are economic 
advantages to hiring someone with experience. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't know what it's like competing with these young kids," she says. "Or 
you talk to a design director and he's about 25 and thinks you can't draw. You 
know, just because you get older doesn't mean you lose your eyesight or can't 
draw. It just means you're getting better."

SINGLE LIFE: MANY SINGLES PAIR UP TEMPORARILY IN WAIT FOR MS. OR MR. WONDERFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Life.

<TEXT>
<P>
A recent "Herman" cartoon sums up the ultimate "standby relationship." In it, a 
suitor presents his love interest with a diamond ring, to which she responds: 
"OK, but only until I find someone better." 
</P>
<P>
While languishing in a dead-end affair all the way to the altar may be the 
extreme exception, many singles indeed pair up with "meantime mates" whom they 
have no intention of marrying. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine residents Sarah, 27, and Dan, 26, enjoy such an arrangement. One reason 
they shirk long-term commitment is that they both "feel too young for 
marriage." Another is that Sarah, a Boston native, hopes to return soon to her 
roots, while Orange County-bred Dan refuses to leave his roots behind. 
</P>
<P>
"I was transferred here two years ago by my company," said Sarah, a personnel 
director. "I've always meant for it to be a temporary adventure; Boston is 
where I belong. So there's no way I could marry someone who's attached to 
California." 
</P>
<P>
Dan allowed, however, that true love would win out in a geographical dilemma. 
"I guess the bottom line is that we're not really in love, although we're best 
friends," said the restaurant manager. "It's that old cliche: We love each 
other, but we're not in love." 
</P>
<P>
For the past year, Sarah and Dan have dated two or three times a week. They 
talk on the telephone almost every day. They escort one another to social 
events, such as Sarah's office Christmas party. He helped her move to her new 
apartment; she helped him paint his. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, they behave like a couple. 
</P>
<P>
"I know it seems weird, but it works out well for us," Sarah said. "If either 
of us were looking for a permanent relationship right now, I don't think this 
would be a good idea; we're so comfortable with each other that we've gotten 
too lazy to date around. But I don't plan to be in California in another year, 
anyway, and Dan's in no hurry to marry. 
</P>
<P>
"Whatever happens, I know this: Dan has made my stay a lot of fun. I would have 
been lonely here if not for him." 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo psychologist Terry Schenk described standby relationships as 
"very common" today. "They may become more so with (the threat of) AIDS. People 
are seeking monogamous partners," she observed. 
</P>
<P>
If, as in Sarah's and Dan's case, the relationship is approached with a mutual 
understanding, Schenk said she sees no real problem with it. "When both people 
are happy, even though there's no romantic love, there's nothing wrong with 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"From one perspective, it may be a healthy relationship -- they just don't want 
to get married. But from another, perhaps there's an avoidance of committing 
oneself to any relationship, not only this one." 
</P>
<P>
While the people involved may claim that they are not in love, breaking up is, 
nonetheless, hard to do. "Even if you're just friends, you're connected, you're 
bonded," Schenk said. "One thing I've found: Even if neither person wants to 
marry the other, the process of leaving is still very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Many standby relationships are not evenhanded. Often, one partner hopes that 
something more will develop. "They think: 'I'm a really wonderful person, and 
when he gets to know me, he'll change his mind,' " Schenk said. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times one person will actually verbalize his feelings: 'I don't want 
to marry you.' Yet the other person doesn't want to hear." 
</P>
<P>
The person who doesn't want marriage isn't using the other, Schenk said. "He 
just likes the companionship. We've all been in relationships that had no 
future, but it was easier to stay than to leave." 
</P>
<P>
One drawback to a standby relationship is that it may distract participants 
from finding more meaningful companionship. Jennifer, 29, an advertising writer 
in Tustin, said that she has had her fill of wasting time on marriage-proof 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
"I've spent my entire 20s on three long-term relationships with people I could 
not foresee marrying," she lamented. "Now I'm wondering, 'What in the world did 
I think I was doing?' I passed up a lot of nice guys for the sake of adventure, 
or just plain laziness." 
</P>
<P>
Two of her boyfriends wanted to marry her, Jennifer said. "But one couldn't 
hold down a job, and I had basic philosophical differences with the other," she 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
"Still, I enjoyed their company -- I've remained friends with all three of the 
guys. In each case, we made a lot of mutual friends, traveled together, 
generally had a great time. And there I'd sit -- two or three years at a time, 
in a relationship that I knew wouldn't end in marriage." 
</P>
<P>
However, Jennifer views herself as the marrying type. "I want children, a house 
with a picket fence and all that stuff." Today, she is in therapy to explore 
the possibility that she fears commitment. "Never again will I get involved in 
an affair that has no goals," she swore. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, on the other hand, would be content to dabble in standby relationships 
for the next few years. "I divorced two years ago, and I'm not in any rush to 
go through that again," said the 49-year-old insurance salesman. 
</P>
<P>
But dating a number of women simultaneously doesn't appeal to him, either. "I'm 
too old for a whirlwind life style," laughed Jackson, who lives in Newport 
Beach and has been seeing the same woman for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
"I've made it clear that I don't want to marry her," Jackson said. "She's just 
a nice transition into bachelorhood after 24 years of marriage." 
</P>
<P>
Schenk said that standby relationships can become more attractive with age -- 
as well as more ensnaring. "The older you get, the scarier it is to leave a 
relationship. It becomes harder to meet people you're compatible with. So you 
start to think: 'Maybe there's nothing better out there.' 
</P>
<P>
"If the relationship is meeting both people's needs, who am I to say that it's 
wrong?" Schenk added. "When people are surveyed about what makes them happy in 
a marriage, companionship and communication are tops on the list -- while sex 
and romantic love are way down on the list. Romantic love changes over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"So if a lot of married people are companions more than they are lovers, why 
shouldn't single people have the same sort of relationships?"

TEEN DRESS TRENDS: SOME LIKE IT FLUORESCENT, SOME DON'T 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From "Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes" to toe rings and bell 
bottoms, everyone has an opinion as to what's hot and what's not in the world

</P>
<P>

skirts, I hate skirts." 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer Poetoehena, 14, freshman, Costa Mesa

skirts with neon colors." 
</P>

Seventeen magazine." 
</P>
<P>
Elisa Gonzales, 15, freshman, Mater Dei 
</P>
<P>
"I like the sporty beach or surf style, and denim. I don't like skin-tight 
clothes. I like it when you can move around and your clothes aren't 
restricting."

</P>
<P>
Lisa Calvano, 14, sophomore, Ocean View 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the valley girl trend, like how they talk and dress. I like to 
wear sweats, T-shirts and cut-off sweats for shorts, because they're 
comfortable and you can do anything in them." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Clairemont, 15, sophomore, Orange 
</P>
<P>
"T-shirts and shorts are my favorites. My least favorite are 'peace' things, 
and I can't stand when people wear all that fluorescent stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Angie Hall, 14, sophomore, Orange 
</P>
<P>
"My least favorite are neon shorts. Flojos (sandals) are my favorite. I don't 
like fluorescent T-shirts and shorts, because they're gaudy looking." 
</P>
<P>
Christy Jacobs, 17, senior, Orange 
</P>
<P>
"Denim shorts are my favorite. My least-favorite style is long, loose skirts." 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Aguilar, 16, junior, Saddleback 
</P>
<P>
"Big hairdos are my least favorite, and baggy and loose clothes are my 
favorite." 
</P>
<P>
Danny Saldivar, 13, freshman, Saddleback 
</P>

SANTA ANA HIGH SOPHOMORE REPRESENTS BOYS CLUBS OF AMERICA AT ALL-STAR GAME

What was it like to watch Monday's All-Star game batting practice from the 
dugout? How about watching Tuesday's game from the commissioner's box, seated 
next to Hall of Famer Billy Williams? 
</P>
<P>
Ask Eddie Alvarez, a 15-year-old sophomore at Santa Ana High, who was chosen to 
represent the Boys Clubs of America as Celebrity Batboy at the All-Star batting 
practice and game at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez was selected batboy because of his interest in baseball and his service 
to the Boys Club, according to Mike Gilmore, program director at the Boys' Club 
of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a good role model for younger kids," Gilmore said. "He helps to organize 
different special events. Also, he's a real big baseball fan and an avid 
player." 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez serves in the Keystone Club, a community service organization for which 
Gilmore is adviser. 
</P>
<P>
"Alvarez is one kid from one boys' club representing all the kids from all the 
boys' clubs in the country," Gilmore said of the All-Star honor. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first found out that I was going to be the batboy, I was surprised," 
Alvarez said. "I wasn't expecting anything like this at all. It was an honor 
for me, because they only chose one person." 
</P>
<P>
On Monday, before arriving at Anaheim Stadium to watch batting practice, 
Alvarez and Kimberly Poarch, 11, of Granite Falls, N.C., who was selected 
Celebrity Batgirl, and former players Williams and Rod Carew visited Childrens 
Hospital of Orange County. Alvarez and Poarch talked with patients while 
Williams and Carew signed autographs. 
</P>
<P>
At batting practice that afternoon, Alvarez accepted a $50,000 check from Leaf 
Candy, a major sponsor of the All-Star event, on behalf of the Boys Clubs of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
"I would really like to thank the Leaf Candy company for giving me the 
opportunity to have participated in all the great events of the All-Star game," 
Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
He was also presented with a complimentary Angels T-shirt and cap and a bat, 
which he got autographed by the All-Stars. 
</P>
<P>
During the contests for home run hitters, outfield-to-catcher relay throws and 
catcher accuracy throws, Alvarez sat in the National League dugout and chatted 
with Dodgers second baseman Willie Randolph and A's first baseman Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
The players "treated me nicely. They asked me how old I was and congratulated 
me for being chosen as the batboy," Alvarez said. "I thought I was going to be 
nervous, but I wasn't. When I was sitting in the dugout talking with the 
players and looking at them practice, I was real excited." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Alvarez attended a luncheon with Williams and Poarch at Anaheim 
Stadium before the game, which he watched from the box of A. Bartlett Giamatti, 
commissioner of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"It was great because you were right down at the field next to the dugout and 
first base," said Alvarez, who then offered this perspective of the American 
League's 5-3 victory: 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that the National League should have won, because they had much 
better players." 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez started playing baseball at age 7, when he also joined the Boys' Club 
of Santa Ana. He was encouraged in the sport by Floyd Nelson, the club's sports 
director. This summer, Alvarez played infield and hit .345 for the Garden Grove 
Pony League A's. 
</P>
<P>
Coming from a family of 10, Alvarez said he turned to baseball as his personal 
means of expression. 
</P>
<P>
"All of (my brothers and sisters) are either much older or much younger, so I 
play baseball to be with people my own age," he said. "I'm caught in the middle 
in our family, so I do my own stuff. I'm the only one in my family who plays 
sports, but my parents still support me. They come to watch me play and ask me 
how practice was and stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez said he has no favorite team, only favorite players. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't like any particular team at one time, but I like certain 
players on certain teams," he said. "I like Angels pitcher Jim Abbott and 
Cardinals shortstop Ozzie Smith right now because they're good players." 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez said he likes playing baseball because "there's so many things you can 
do. You can get a base hit, make double plays, steal bases. . . . I like 
playing third base the best, because you get the most balls." 
</P>
<P>
But Alvarez is not planning a career in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to make the pros now, because there are so many people playing 
baseball," he said. "I want to go to college so I can get a good career. Being 
a reporter seems like a good job, because you get to travel a lot and you get 
to write about sports." 
</P>
<P>
Aside from helping him get to the All-Star game, Alvarez said, the club has 
done many good things for him and boys and girls his age. 
</P>
<P>
The club "affected my life a lot," he said. "The neighborhood I live in isn't 
very nice. If the Boys Club wasn't located in the area, I would probably be 
selling drugs like all the people around me. We're in the middle of all the bad 
things that go on, but we (club members) are not involved with any of it."

The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews. 
</P>
<P>
Mayur, 2931 E. Coast Highway, Corona del Mar. (714) 675-6622. Open Mondays 
through Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 2:30, 5:30 to 11:30; Saturdays 5:30 to 11:30, 
Sundays noon to 11:30. 
</P>
<P>
Breads like naan and aijwan paratha are perfect, steaming from the tandoor. 
Fish tikka comes dripping spice. Lamb vindaloo, a Goan preparation with 
vinegar, chili and potato, is hot, fragrant and well balanced. Be wary of the 
oily vegetable dishes and the unctuous service. 
</P>
<P>
Spaghettini, 3005 Old Ranch Parkway, Seal Beach. (213) 596-2199. Open Mondays 
through Fridays 11 a.m. to 3:30, 4:30 to 10; Saturdays noon to 3:30, 4:30 to 
10:30; Sundays noon to 3:30, 4:30 to 9:30. 
</P>
<P>
 A swank Seal Beach grill and pasta house, Spaghettini gets by largely on 
beauty: The food is somewhat spotty. Appetizers have little character, but 
pizzas are full grown and yeasty, fresh from an oak-burning brick oven. Pastas 
are made fresh daily but are not necessarily well prepared. Linguini clams 
turns out to be a bowl of sticky glop. It's best to stick with items from the 
restaurant's mesquite grill, like the perfectly blackened veal chop or the 
excellent mixed grill. 
</P>
<P>
El Ranchito, 1351H Beach Boulevard, La Habra. (213) 943-6020. Open Sundays 
through Thursdays 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Manana, 17171 Brookhurst St., Fountain Valley. (714) 963-8673. Open Mondays 
through Thursdays 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 La Salsa, Irvine Ranch Farmers Market, Fashion Island, Newport Beach ((714) 
640-4289) and Santa Ana MainPlace ((714) 543-9524). Open from 9 to 9 weekdays, 
11 to 9 weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone, it seems, has his secret Mexican haunt, where the chilies are hotter 
or the tortillas fresher. El Ranchito is the place for carnitas, chunked pork 
marinated in lemon and garlic, and for some of the most toothsome handmade 
tortillas in the area. Larry Cano's Manana specializes in fajitas, giant 
portions that easily feed two, loaded with trimmed meats, red and yellow 
peppers, tomatoes and carmelized onion. Best of all is La Salsa, a humble food 
stand dispensing antojitos, soft tacos, quesadillas and Mexican sandwiches. 
Meats here are impeccable, accompaniments rapturous. 
</P>
<P>
Gemmell's, 3000 Bristol St., Costa Mesa. (714) 751-1074. Open Mondays through 
Fridays 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., Mondays through Saturdays 6 to 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 You've seen it all before: the quiet, understated rooms, the tables draped 
like ballroom gowns, the silver domes, the brandy cart. At Gemmell's, thank 
heaven, it all makes sense. Treat yourself to an evening here, feasting on such 
specialties as goose liver wrapped in blackened cabbage, lobster in Sauteres, 
veal chop with morels. Chef Byron Gemmell has a carefuly designed menu with 
nearly every item on it worthy of praise. Prepare to pay handsomely for the 
privlege of praising. 
</P>
<P>
McCormick and Schmick, 2000 Main St., Irvine. (714) 756-0505. Open Mondays 
through Fridays 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Saturdays 5 p.m. to 11 p.m., Sundays 5 p.m. 
to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 McCormick and Schmick is the latest member of an exclusive chain that started 
in the Pacific Northwest, a slick, muscular operation specializing in fresh 
seafoods, and the food is terrific. Oysters like Quilicene, Olympia, Golden 
Mantle, and Skookum taste as if they have just been dragged from the sea. Fish 
like Copper River salmon in cream wiith bay scallops, or sea bass with Jamaican 
spices, are good enough to make a grown man weep. Non-fish eaters can feast on 
marinated chicken, or Cajun cheeseburgers. Head of the class. 
</P>
<P>
China Palms, Fullerton Metro Center, 104 W. Orangethorpe Ave., Fullerton. (714) 
526-2196. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Ling put a palm tree in the middle of his restaurant, an airy, 
ultra-modern dining room in Fullerton's spanking new Metro Center. But there is 
nothing tropical about the solid pan-Chinese food he serves, made in one of the 
most accomplished Chinese kitchens around. Cold dishes, dumplings and 
first-rate soups make perfect beginnings. Honey-glazed bananas, plunged 
steaming into an ice-filled bowl tableside, make perfect endings. The goodies 
you can have in between are too numerous to mention. 
</P>
<P>
sg 
</P>
<P>
Yankee Tavern, 333 Bayside Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 675 5333. Open nightly 
5:30 to midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know Yankee Tavern owner Hans Prager as proprietor of the Ritz may 
be surprised to see him in this urban roadhouse, catering to a crowd hungry for 
low prices, speedy service and an unpretentious menu. The food here is almost 
unfailingly good, though, in a cafeteria-style manner. Meat loaf, pot pie, lamb 
shanks and fresh seafoods are featured.

SOVIETS GRILL KGB CHIEF BEFORE HIS REAPPOINTMENT

<P>
Legislators today questioned KGB chief Vladimir Kryuchkov about the workings of 
his secretive agency and laughed in disbelief at some of his answers, but they 
voted by a resounding majority to reappoint him. 
</P>
<P>
The most aggressive deputies were unimpressed with Kryuchkov's responses to 
queries on phone taps, informers and dossiers. But they relished the first 
opportunity in Soviet history for a public grilling of the boss of the KGB, 
which killed millions of Soviet citizens during the reign of Josef Stalin and 
is still feared by many citizens. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Six Nay Votes 
</P>
<P>
Only six members of the 542-member Supreme Soviet voted against the 65-year-old 
Kryuchkov, who has been KGB chairman since last year and was deputy chairman 
for 10 years before that. 
</P>
<P>
Kryuchkov's confirmation came despite derisive snorts of laughter from the hall 
when he claimed that the KGB does not tap Soviet citizens' phones and 
complaints from several deputies about the KGB's network of informers. 
</P>
<P>
Kryuchkov said the agency, which performs both domestic and foreign security 
functions, "strictly follows Soviet laws" and has only a few "helpers" who 
inform on their neighbors and colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Boris Yeltsin said Kryuchkov's statements about informers were 
"insincere" and that in reality "an army of many thousands constantly informs 
on what is happening in each work collective." 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said there were agents in every Soviet institution. Yet during the 10 
years he spent as Communist Party chief in the city of Sverdlovsk, "They never 
caught a single spy." 
</P>
<P>
Kryuchkov refused to reveal the KGB's budget despite repeated inquiries, but he 
said it would be published soon and "you will be surprised when you see it."

On a day when leaders of seven industrialized nations formally opened their 
economic summit here, mounted Republican Guards in silver helmets pranced down 
the Champs Elysees below jet fighters trailing the national colors today in a 
show of precision, pomp and might honoring Bastille Day and the 200th 
anniversary of the French Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
More than 250 planes and helicopters streaked overhead in the daytime military 
display, to be followed hours later on the flag-bedecked avenue by a nocturnal 
fantasy of elephants, dancing bears and marching bands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Martial Music 
</P>
<P>
Columns of more than 5,000 men and women, from frogmen to Foreign Legionnaires, 
300 armored vehicles, unarmed mobile missiles and sophisticated transmission 
equipment paraded to martial music this morning. 
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry said up to 1 million people lined the city's most 
celebrated avenue for the spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
President Francois Mitterrand reviewed the troops at the Place de l'Etoile and 
then, standing in a light reconnaissance vehicle, rode down the avenue to the 
Place de la Concorde. There he joined President Bush and other world leaders in 
the presidential tribune, at the site where the guillotine stood during the 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the ceremonial start of the summit, the 15th such meeting, was held in 
the spectacular but controversial Louvre Pyramid, the new, giant glass 
structure designed by American architect I. M. Pei that serves as an entrance 
to the national museum of France. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Summit for Bush 
</P>
<P>
Bush, attending his first summit, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and 
Japan's Prime Minister Sosuke Uno were among those welcomed by Mitterrand. 
</P>
<P>
At a later working dinner at the Hotel de la Marine, White House Chief of Staff 
John H. Sununu said, "The focus will probably be on the political issues" that 
are expected to be a major topic during the talks that conclude Sunday.

Argentina's economy minister, Miguel Roig, died of a heart attack today, less 
than a week after taking on the task of restoring the debt-ridden country's 
crumbling economy. 
</P>
<P>
Roig, 68, died in a car while traveling from the French Embassy to the Economy 
Ministry. Roig's first job on taking office was to announce a tough austerity 
program in an attempt to quash hyperinflation. 
</P>
<P>
Roig, who had spent most of his career in business rather than politics, was 
appointed by President Carlos Menem to make a frontal attack on the country's 
worst-ever economic crisis.

Seven American military policemen wounded in a bomb attack while walking in the 
port city of La Ceiba had left their quarters without permission, a U.S. 
Embassy spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy spokesman Charles Barclay said the soldiers were supposed to spend 
the night at facilities under U.S.-Honduran military control outside La Ceiba. 
Instead, they went out on the town. "My understanding is that they did not have 
authorization to go out after dark," Barclay said. 
</P>
<P>
Barclay said he had been unable to determine from military officials if the men 
were officially absent without leave. "I don't think they were AWOL," Barclay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, the Defense Department said today one of the men was in critical 
but stable condition and three, including Staff Sgt. Robert Nelson, 27, of 
Ontario, Calif., were in serious condition after being flown to Brooke Army 
hospital in San Antonio, Tex.

The former chief of staff of the Soviet Army will testify next week before the 
House Armed Services Committee, Chairman Les Aspin said today. 
</P>
<P>
Marshal Sergey F. Akhromeyev will be questioned July 21 about arms control, the 
Soviet military budget and military cuts announced by Soviet leader Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev, the Wisconsin Democrat said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an unprecedented chance to question a top Soviet military official on 
our turf by our rules," said Aspin, who was criticized earlier this year when 
other, lower-ranking Soviet officials appeared before his committee. 
</P>
<P>
Akhromeyev retired from the military last year but continues to advise 
Gorbachev.

Gunmen assassinated Iranian Kurdish opposition leader Abdolrahman Qassemlu and 
two other exiled Kurdish activists and wounded a man with an Iranian diplomatic 
passport as they met in Vienna, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
"The murders were politically motivated," Police Chief Werner Liebhart told a 
news conference. "We don't know what the meeting was about." 
</P>
<P>
Liebhart said the three killers, who fled, burst into an apartment in central 
Vienna where the four men had held talks Thursday evening and immediately 
opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
Qassemlu, 59, was secretary general of the pro-Iraqi Democratic Party of 
Kurdistan. In Tehran, independent sources who declined to be named said 
Qassemlu, who has led the Iranian Kurds against Tehran for over 20 years, had 
been negotiating a settlement with the leadership emerging in Tehran after the 
death of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini last month.

2 EX-HUD OFFICIALS DISPUTE PIERCE ON HIS ROLE IN FUNDING DECISIONS 
</P>

<P>
Two former officials of the Housing and Urban Development Department today 
contradicted the claim of ex-HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. that he was not 
directly involved in deciding which housing projects should be funded. 
</P>
<P>
The officials told a House Government Operations subcommittee that Pierce 
overruled nearly unanimous recommendations of the department's professional 
staff and directed approval of a rehabilitation project in Durham, N.C., sought 
by Pierce's former law partner. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) described the testimony as "frankly 
devastating" in the subcommittee's continuing investigation of fraud, influence 
peddling and other abuses at HUD during President Reagan's Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) suggested that as a result of testimony about 
Pierce's role "the factual noose seems to be tightening around his neck." 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee heard today from Shirley Wiseman, who served at HUD from 1983 
to 1985, and Janet Hale, who succeeded Wiseman as general deputy assistant 
secretary. Both said the plan to turn a former hosiery mill in Durham into a 
housing project for elderly residents was opposed consistently by HUD's 
professional staff, but both were told Pierce wanted it funded. 
</P>
<P>
The project was sought by Pierce's one-time law partner, former Durham Mayor 
Charles Markham, who was seeking HUD financing for the North Carolina project. 
</P>
<P>
The project eventually was funded despite staff findings that the building was 
too close to railroad tracks, was dangerous because of leftover chemical wastes 
and would have required several subsidies and waivers. Its developers received 
about $16 million in rent subsidies, grants and tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tells of Instructions 
</P>
<P>
Wiseman said she was told by Deborah Gore Dean, Pierce's executive assistant, 
that the project should be approved for funding and Pierce wanted it approved. 
</P>
<P>
Wiseman said when she refused to approve it she was called by Pierce. "This was 
the only time I ever recollect the secretary calling me and telling me to fund 
something," she told the subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Wiseman said Pierce's exact words to her were, "I want the project funded." 
</P>
<P>
"I can't fund it but I will send it upstairs to you," Wiseman said she told 
Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
Wiseman said she remained convinced the project was "a bad business deal" and 
refused to approve it despite Pierce's intervention, sending it to his office 
unsigned. She left HUD in 1985 for other reasons and was replaced by Hale. 
</P>
<P>
Hale said "the next day" after she took over as deputy assistant secretary she 
was contacted by Dean, who asked her to sign papers needed to carry out funding 
for the Durham project Pierce had authorized. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sought Pierce Meeting 
</P>
<P>
Hale said she signed the papers but later, when she was asked to sign needed 
waivers, she told Dean of her concerns about the project and tried to arrange a 
meeting with Pierce. The meeting never took place, she testified. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be sure that Deborah or the secretary understood there would be 
tremendous opposition (from HUD staff)," Hale told the subcommittee. "To my 
knowledge, there was no one else (beside Pierce and Dean) who supported the 
project in the building." 
</P>
<P>
Dean, using Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination, refused in 
July to testify before the subcommittee. Some reports have indicated she was 
negotiating for immunity from prosecution, but committee Chairman Tom Lantos 
(D-San Mateo) denied it.

RALLY ROLLS ON: DOW UP 16.5 -- NINTH STRAIGHT GAIN

<P>
Wall Street stocks advanced to yet another post-crash peak today after the 
market reversed a steep early fall to finish higher for the ninth session in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average, up every day so far this month, rose 16.50 
points to close at 2,554.82. Since the rally began two weeks ago, the Dow has 
chalked up more than 110 points. 
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the market's gains to a growing view that the economy will 
not weaken enough to cause more than a mild recession. 
</P>
<P>
The market slumped earlier, knocking 26 points off the Dow at one stage, as 
brokers sifted through a stream of economic data that included a worrisome rise 
in June's core wholesale inflation rate. 
</P>
<P>
The market's fatigue, natural after such a drawn-out advance, was evident in 
the shrinking margin between rising and declining issues in the broader market. 
</P>
<P>
Advances outnumbered declines 16 to 13 in active New York Stock Exchange volume 
of about 184 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices sagged and long-term interest rates bounced higher in volatile 
trading today as the market reacted negatively to the latest economic news. 
</P>
<P>
By late this morning, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was down 3/4 point, 
or about $7.50 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite 
direction from its price, climbed to 8.11% from 8.03% late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, evidence of economic weakness furnished by government reports 
inspired buying enthusiasm in the bond market but the rally soon faded. 
</P>
<P>
Normally the credit market would welcome signs that a slowdown in economic 
activity is being accompanied by a moderation in inflation. 
</P>
<P>
But Maria F. Ramirez, an economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said the 
market had built up its hopes ahead of the numbers and pushed up bond prices to 
very high levels. When the reports merely confirmed widely held views, traders 
decided to sell and collect profits. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that the market is falling apart, it's retrenching a little bit from 
very expensive levels," said Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments 
were down 1/32 point to 1/16 point, intermediate maturities were 1/16 point to 
7/32 point lower and long-term issues were down 11/32 point to 3/4 point, 
according to Telerate Inc., the financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price 
movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or 
longer, fell 1.88 to 1,189.22. 
</P>
<P>
In corporate trading, industrials clung to small gains. Moody's investment 
grade corporate bond index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 
corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, edged up 0.02 to 
330.06. 
</P>
<P>
Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged, at 8.01%, and the discount 
also held steady at 7.76%. Yields on six-month bills rose to 7.99% as the 
discount rose 6 basis points to 7.59%. Yields on one-year bills remained at 
7.82% as the discount stayed at 7.30%.

The FBI said today it is conducting a preliminary investigation of alleged 
financial fraud at an Energy Department plant in Ohio that makes materials for 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Edwin Boldt, an FBI spokesman in Cincinnati, said the probe is unrelated to the 
Energy Department's decision to launch on Thursday its own investigation of 
environmental controls and other operations at the Feed Materials Production 
Center in Fernald, Ohio, one of the key contributors to U.S. nuclear weapons 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Boldt said the FBI investigation was triggered by an allegation of criminal 
wrongdoing in contracting of the Fernald plant work. He declined to identify 
either the origin of the allegation, the date of its receipt by the FBI or the 
specific nature of the alleged fraud.

Federal tax agents are throwing a brushback pitch at Billy Martin, the baseball 
legend living a quiet farming life in Upstate New York. 
</P>
<P>
A $35,564.62 tax lien has been filed against Martin by agents working out of 
the Internal Revenue Service's Buffalo district office, the Buffalo News 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The lien against Martin -- former New York Yankees manager known for his 
brawling style and battles with team owner George Steinbrenner -- was filed 
Tuesday in the Broome County clerk's office in Binghamton. Martin is identified 
in legal papers as Alfred M. Martin of Port Crane. 
</P>
<P>
Broome is one of 32 counties in western and central New York under the 
jurisdiction of the Buffalo IRS office. 
</P>
<P>
The lien resulted from "an outstanding balance from Mr. Martin's 1987 personal 
income taxes," said office spokesman Terry Dunford. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'We Can Seize Assets' 
</P>
<P>
"We make numerous efforts to contact the person. If that fails, the IRS files a 
tax lien. It's a public notice of tax liability," Dunford said. "After filing a 
lien, the government tries to work out a payment schedule with the individual. 
If that fails, we can seize assets, property or levy bank accounts." 
</P>
<P>
Citing IRS regulations on privacy, Dunford said he could not discuss any more 
details. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, Martin, 60, has been living on a large farm in Port Crane, a hamlet 
of the Town of Fenton, eight miles north of Binghamton. His Port Crane 
telephone is unlisted, and efforts to reach him through the Yankees' team 
offices in New York were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief interview published in Thursday's USA Today, Martin said he is 
enjoying a quiet life that contrasted with his days in baseball's spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"I have sheep, cattle, ducks, geese and a few horses," he said. "I like it 
because we also have an 80-acre lake. I do everything. I raise pheasants and 
turn them loose."

Three East German soccer players who defected from their team in Sweden have 
arrived in West Germany, the Bild newspaper said today. 
</P>
<P>
The three reported to the West German consulate in Goteborg on Wednesday and 
were put on a ship that took them to the West German port of Kiel, the 
newspaper said. They arrived Thursday, and Bild printed a photograph of the 
three walking from the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
Bild identified them as Jens Koenig, 24; Andre Koehler, 24, and Thomas Weiss, 
21. The report said the three hope to continue their careers in West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
They defected hours before their East German first-division team, Wismut Aue, 
played Orgryte IF of Sweden in a Toto Cup match.

Ferruzzi Fights Liquidation Order: Citing possible harm to the public, U.S. 
District Judge James Zagel denied a request for a temporary injunction by 
Ferruzzi Trading International SA and Ferruzzi USA Inc. to block a Chicago 
Board of Trade order that is forcing the firm to sell a huge quantity of 
soybean futures. The lawsuit sought the restraining order and a permanent 
injunction against the exchange's directive. Published reports have said the 
firm was the object of the directive because it was trying to corner the 
soybean market -- something Ferruzzi denies.
