<TEXT>
<P>
Leave it to the City Council to honor champion sled dog racer Susan Butcher on 
a smoggy, scorching day in which the city's traffic flow was plunged into chaos 
by the nightmarish Metro Rail fire. 
</P>
<P>
Butcher, in town for a pet supply trade show, is four-time winner of the 
1,158-mile Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, held in the snowy, subzero climes of 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Like many commuters Friday, Butcher, who received a commendation from the 
council, took a circuitous route downtown. It began early Thursday night, she 
said, when, after having mushed her dogs, she boarded a single-engine plane at 
her home 150 miles north of Fairbanks. 
</P>
<P>
The flight was the difficult part, according to the champ, since her 9 a.m. 
drive from LAX to City Hall proved a breeze. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the traffic reports on the radio," Butcher theorized, "people must 
have been staying away from downtown. We buzzed in in about 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"But now I'm boiling from the heat," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The council's impeccable sense of timing was even more apparent when, after 
hearing a dizzying half-hour report from top fire officials about the 
potentially staggering impact of the Metro Rail blaze, council members 
proceeded to welcome Mickey Mouse into their meeting room. 
</P>
<P>
The silent, smiling rodent had made the trip downtown to accept a proclamation 
from Council President John Ferraro in honor of Disneyland's 35th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a terrible time to be presenting a resolution to Disneyland," noted 
Ferraro. "But Mickey, we love to have you here because you don't talk and 
that's an unusual thing in this council chamber." 
</P>
<P>
Bugs Bunny, along with pioneer animator Friz Freleng, were also due to be 
honored by the council Friday morning. But the pair postponed their appearance 
due to the Metro Rail conflagration. 
</P>
<P>
Explained Councilman Joel Wachs: "They didn't think there'd be enough carrots 
down here because of the congestion." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, Bugs and Friz were probably following the advice of the KFWB traffic 
reporter who warned listeners at 8:15 a.m.: "The best alternate route is to 
stay home." 
</P>
<P>
Today's kickoff of the new Long Beach-to-Los Angeles Blue Line light-rail 
service brings back wistful memories of the old Red Cars that sped passengers 
along 1,000 miles of track through Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and 
Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
Construction costs for the original trolley line were roughly $1 million, 
compared to $877 million for the new service. Yet, these days it will take five 
minutes longer than it did in 1902 to traverse the route -- 55 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
County transit planners can only hope that the Blue Line will draw a similar 
reception to that of the Red Cars. Here is a portion of The Times account of 
the July 4, 1902, Red Car opening: 
</P>
<P>
"Every car that left in the morning was weighted to the roof with passengers. 
They were wedged into the seats and aisles as tightly as matches in a box; some 
clung to the stanchions and others piled onto the roofs." 
</P>

L.A.'s most recent Doomsday prophets have predicted that the Freeway (and Metro 
Rail) City would fall into the sea on May 10, 1988, (based on the writings of 
the French astrologer Nostradamus); April 10, 1981, at 5:31 a.m. (according to 
financial prognosticator Joseph Granville) and Feb. 12, 1969, (inspired by the 
book, "The Last Days of the Late, Great State of California").

TOTALITARIANISM WAS SIMPLER; 
</P>
<P>
* YELTSIN SHOWS THE PARTY'S REALLY OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decision by Boris N. Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, and the 
members of the Democratic Platform to bolt the Soviet Communist Party poses a 
challenge not only for Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but also for the architects of 
U.S. foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's justification for his resignation is as interesting as the act 
itself: "In view of my . . . great responsibility toward the people of Russia 
and in connection with moves toward a multi-party state," he said, "I cannot 
fulfill only the instructions of the Communist Party. As the highest elected 
figure in the republic, I have to bow to the will of all the people." 
</P>
<P>
Vyacheslav Shostakovsky, rector of the prestigious Moscow Higher Party School 
and a founder of Democratic Platform, said his faction decided to walk because 
the party "congress did not realize our hopes for the separation of party and 
government functions." 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, the two notions embedded in these statements -- an elected 
official's obligation to his constituents and the legitimacy of loyal 
opposition -- signal a resumption of the Russian experiment with normative 
politics begun in that brief period between the fall of Czar Nicholas and the 
Bolshevik coup. For the Soviet people, who paid in blood for the party's 
consolidation of power and in deprivation through the long, bleak years of its 
stagnation, this is a singular and welcome event. One of the lessons of the 
20th Century is that democratic, multi-party politics is a necessary, though 
not sufficient, condition for genuine material progress. 
</P>
<P>
But however burdensome the Communist Party's tyranny has been for the Soviet 
people, it has made Moscow a rather convenient regime with which to deal. 
Soviet diplomats, in fact, frequently have complained that the United States 
has been the unstable, unpredictable partner in the superpower relationship. In 
a sense, they have been correct: When a democratic nation changes governments, 
it can change policies, including foreign policies. The United States must now 
adjust to the prospect that this may occur in Moscow as well as in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Other possibilities are even more worrisome. One anxiety shared by populists 
like Yeltsin and Marxist democrats like Alexander V. Buzgalin of the Marxist 
Platform faction is the concentration of power with Gorbachev. As Buzgalin put 
it, Gorbachev's election as party "general secretary without meaningful control 
from the Central Committee, with no right to recall him, plus his powers as 
Soviet president -- this is a gigantic accumulation of powers in the hands of 
one man and very dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
So, too, are its implications for the United States. Consider this: In some 
future confrontation between unpredictable but democratically elected leaders 
like Yeltsin and a stable but authoritarian figure like Gorbachev, where would 
American interests rest?

SELLING DEFUNCT SAVINGS AND LOANS AT BARGAIN PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that Charles Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan scandal has disappeared 
from the headlines, along comes one to top it. It's Miami's CenTrust Bank 
bankruptcy that will also cost taxpayers over $2 billion (front page, June 24). 
</P>
<P>
Once again I was shocked to read about the criminal mismanagement of the 
savings and loans that it is estimated will cost us citizens $500 billion. 
</P>
<P>
David Paul, chairman of CenTrust, lived like a king for years and in effect 
sent the bills to us for payment. He helped himself to $16 million in pay 
during the last six years as a reward for his mismanagement. He had custom 
built a teak dock to house his $7-million yacht. He furnished his bank's 
executive dining room with Baccarat crystal goblets, Tiffany ashtrays, pounds 
of the most costly silver service and Limoges dinnerware. And that's only part 
of the excesses that we will be paying for in the years to come. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to be the same old story. Steal a loaf of bread and you go to jail. 
Steal millions or billions and you walk around free like Keating and Paul, not 
to mention the President's son, Neil Bush, who was involved in the Silverado 
S&amp;L heist in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
It's time that white-collar bank robbers were punished to the fullest extent of 
the law. Pious words from President Bush on this subject are not enough. We are 
entitled to action.

SELLING DEFUNCT SAVINGS AND LOANS AT BARGAIN PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The defunct savings and loan properties are to be sold at virtually "fire sale" 
prices, which will result in potential billion-dollar losses. Where's the 
hurry? 
</P>
<P>
I am no real estate expert, but we all expect some inflation in the years 
ahead. The purchasers of the properties at bargain prices, reselling them 
several years hence, will surely profit handsomely, if for no other reason than 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
We know that the government does not want to be in the business of real estate, 
but surely ways can be found to market these properties over the years on a 
selective basis. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps a highly respected figure in the private sector of real estate can head 
a specially created department to manage and dispose of these properties at the 
right and earliest time to minimize the final losses, if any.

STATE'S MEDFLY SPRAYING POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My family and I feel we are in a nightmare from which there is no end. We have 
been sprayed 12 times with malathion and now we are scheduled to be sprayed 
three more times, probably all summer. 
</P>
<P>
I have a 6-month-old son and a 3-year-old daughter, and my greatest fear for 
their health is from our own state government! Our despair, anger and disgust 
are overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
California is cutting back funds for trauma centers, schools, the disabled and 
the blind -- but it blithely spends $100 million for pesticides and 
helicopters! We have a drought in Los Angeles and can't wash our cars or water 
our yards without getting a fine, but the state can dump all the pesticides it 
wants on those same yards and cars. 
</P>
<P>
California's shortfall is not in money -- it's in morality.

I quote Sullum: "Yet the Jacksonville and Stockton massacres cast serious

If I understand Mr. Sullum, he believes that, since we can't stop all maniacs 
from buying all types of semiautomatic weapons, regulatory laws are useless. 
His logic escapes me. If gun control laws can prevent just some of the 
rampages, I shall be immensely gratified.

PROS AND CONS OVER LEGISLATION TO OPEN ADOPTION RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Times' editorial "Don't Lift the Curtain of Privacy" (July 6) and "Who Am 
I? -- A Basic Right" by adoptee Jacki Weber (Commentary, July 7) will 
undoubtedly result in a flood of such letters on these two most often argued 
positions. However, anyone who believes the "right of privacy" has been 
mandated to "protect" 135 million adoption-affected persons in the United 
States from a manufactured "stigma of illegitimacy" ought to rethink adoption 
and address yet a third position on the issue -- the legitimacy of adoption 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
Adoption shifts the burden of the state to private individuals. The majority of 
states sealed adoption records when New Deal social welfare programs were 
emerging following the Depression, for unquestioned transfer of responsibility 
and accountability. Today, the Bush Administration hypes the "adoption option" 
couched in anti-abortion rhetoric while Barbara Bush is honorary chair to the 
National Committee For Adoption, the sealed records lobby of adoption agencies, 
backed by corporate funding. NCFA's own broad estimate of "5-10-million 
adoptees of all ages in the U.S." is the basis for adoption reform groups' 
estimates of "135 million adoption-affected persons," given that every adoptee 
has two sets of parents, grandparents and other immediate relatives including 
siblings. That's a lot of unrequested and unneeded "protection." University 
studies have placed the figure for those desiring openness at closer to 95%, 
not 5%. 
</P>
<P>
I have filed class actions in California, Connecticut, New York, Missouri (and 
one in the works in Washington, D.C.) on behalf of adoption-affected persons 
attempting to open their own records through bureaucratic labyrinths even in 
urgent medical situations. 
</P>
<P>
But, in California especially where 70% of all adoptions are "independent" 
(handled by attorneys, private agencies, physicians and "matching centers" 
recruiting pregnant women and adopters from other states at $8-$30,000 per 
transaction) adoption is clearly "big business." Sealed records secrecy and 
even "adult access" compromises (such as AB 3907) assure a neat and tidy 
transaction and the perpetuation of "adoption-related businesses."

DEVOID OF REAL HEROES.

By GEORGE F. WILL, George F. Will writes a syndicated column in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At midday, when Washingtonians are unlashed from their galley oars and allowed 
to wander off in search of lunch, many of the currently mighty go to the Palm 
restaurant. The experience should be chastening as well as nourishing. 
</P>
<P>
The Palm's walls are covered with caricatures of famous faces from a few years 
ago. Almost all are unknown to almost everyone today. Sic transit what? Glory? 
Hardly. Fame? Not really. Celebrity is the perishable commodity. 
</P>
<P>
That is the subject of a slender, melancholy novel on the sociology of 
celebrity. The author is Michael Herr. The title is "Walter Winchell." 
</P>
<P>
Winchell was a terrible person and a grotesque social phenomenon. In the 1940s, 
he was at the apogee of a career that went from ripeness to putrescence with a 
speed satisfying because appropriate. He dealt in ephemera, and such he proved 
to be. But for awhile he prospered by feeding -- and by feeding, enlarging -- 
the nation's appetite for gossip, which is the democratic voyeurism of the 
masses. 
</P>
<P>
He was America's most widely read journalist, serving up six columns a week to 
more than 1,000 newspapers, and his weekly radio broadcast was heard by more 
people than the 50 million who read him, one-third of America's population 
then. Herr captures (so well you want to take a shower) the rawness of the man 
who hung out in the Stork Club in Manhattan with Hemingway and Damon Runyon and 
low-lifes who were products as well as producers of our burgeoning publicity 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Herr calls Winchell "the architect and the inventor of the end of private life" 
and the "endless river of facts and distractions and gossip" with which we are 
inundated. This blitzkrieg of clutter, often called news, leads to survival of 
the briefest, because America's attention span is approximately 9.8 seconds. 
That was the length of the average TV "sound bite" of candidates in the 1988 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
"If people go around today treating themselves like celebrities because not to 
be a celebrity is just too awful, we may have Walter Winchell to thank," says 
Herr. 
</P>
<P>
No thanks. Do not confuse symptoms with cause. Thank -- blame -- democracy, and 
the Graphic Revolution, and human nature. 
</P>
<P>
Democracy -- equality before the law -- may be an irritant provoking an itch 
for distinction, even the derivative distinction of knowing the inside skinny 
about the ersatz-distinguished. Magically, celebrity can be mass-produced, yet 
seem scarce. And it is democratic -- available to anyone -- because it is 
unconnected with merit: Al Capone, one of America's first superstars, was 
applauded at the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, 11 years before Winchell died in obscurity, Daniel Boorstin published 
"The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America." A pseudo-event is something 
manufactured to seem significant. Celebrities are human pseudo-events. 
</P>
<P>
What Boorstin calls the Graphic Revolution, from photography to television, 
created novel powers for making people famous. Today our overpopulated 
consciousness is chock-full of celebrities, people well-known for being 
well-known. Celebrity, says Boorstin, is a new kind of eminence, a reflection 
of the audience's emptiness, a receptacle into which people pour their 
purposelessness. 
</P>
<P>
The democratic ethos, celebrating the power of the people to govern themselves, 
encourages derogation of heroes. Modern "democratic" historiography expels 
heroes (and hence drama) from the human drama, replacing them with "forces" and 
"classes" and "the people." But the empty pantheon is reoccupied by 
celebrities, products of modern techniques for fabricating well-knownness. 
</P>
<P>
Time was when people felt themselves made better by heroes who made themselves. 
But celebrities are made democratically, by the people, and thus have no power 
other than to amuse. 
</P>
<P>
Boorstin notes that people with real fame enter a nation's consciousness 
slowly, and inhabit its past. Celebrities exist only in the moment. And for a 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
The agency that makes celebrities -- publicity -- unmakes them, depriving them 
of all they had: novelty. Round-the-clock media begets saturation journalism 
(broadly defined), which wears out subjects quicker than you can say "Trump!" 
</P>
<P>
"News," said one of Hearst's first editors, "is anything that makes a reader 
say, 'Gee whiz!"' It is impossible to exaggerate the unimportance of most 
things that make people say that.

PROS AND CONS OVER LEGISLATION TO OPEN ADOPTION RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your scenario of the midnight knock on the door is unduly alarmist. You 
apparently are not familiar with the workings of the adoption process. It is 
highly unlikely that a person in this situation would present him or herself 
unannounced in such a way. It would take much careful thought before making 
even tentative contact with a biological parent or child. 
</P>
<P>
Four of my children are adopted. We never made it a condition of the adoptions 
that they be secret. In actual fact, in the case of adoptions carried out up to 
1984, there was no way for an adoption to be "open," as the records were 
automatically sealed, regardless of the views of either set of parents. Who is 
to say that many of these families would not have preferred to leave the record 
open in order to facilitate a reunion later in life? Knowing firsthand the 
mental trauma suffered by many adopted children (and, I am sure, by their 
biological parents), I feel that it is only fair to open all the records and 
thus make it easier for reunions to take place. 
</P>
<P>
It may be true that in earlier decades mothers who relinquished their children 
for adoption were subject to embarrassment because of their situation, but with 
the healthier climate of openness prevailing today it would be a benefit to 
mental health to make it possible for some of these parents and their children 
to allay the ghosts of the past and face reality, even if they are not at 
present aware that this might be a good thing. The idea of keeping adoption 
records secret is a holdover from the days when the adoption was kept a secret 
even from the child, which everyone now agrees was a very unhealthy thing to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
I submit that it is equally unhealthy and unjust to retain this shroud of 
mystery over a normal fact of life, thus making it difficult and costly for 
adoptive children and parents to find each other.

A lawyer for the family of police cadet Timothy Shepard, who died after 
collapsing on the first day of training, said Friday that a settlement has been 
reached in a lawsuit against the state. 
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement did not allow him to disclose the terms. 
</P>
<P>
Shepard and 15 other recruits became ill during the first day of training, a 
hot day in September, 1988, at the Agawam training academy. Shepard died two 
months later. The incident led to changes in the way the state trains officers.

REOPENING OF FREEWAY AWAITS TUNNEL CHECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II and VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The two-mile section of the Hollywood Freeway that was closed Friday because of 
the subway tunnel fire will not be opened before this afternnoon, and the 
closure might last substantially longer, state transportation officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
A 100-foot section of the roof over the stricken tunnel collapsed to within 10 
feet of the freeway, and officials are concerned that heat from the fire might 
have weakened the 18- to 20-foot-thick wall of soil directly between the tunnel 
and the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Baxter, head of the state Department of Transportation district 
encompassing Los Angeles, said the agency would not be able to make any 
decisions about reopening the freeway until civil engineers were able to enter 
the tunnel and assess the strength of the soil above it. The fire directly 
under the freeway was extinguished Friday afternoon, but engineers were driven 
back by the heat when they attempted to enter the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
According to Los Angeles Fire Marshal Dave Parsons, engineers were planning to 
enter the tunnel Friday evening, if it had cooled sufficiently, to begin 
shoring it up with a timber frame. They hoped yo have the framing completed by 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
If the freeway segment remains closed through Monday or longer, it is expected 
to create problems for commuters because the freeway, U.S. 101, is the main 
artery linking downtown Los Angeles to Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers reported being concerned about the safety of the freeway because it 
is not built on bedrock in that area. Rather, it is supported by compacted 
earth and sand that have been injected with cement-like grouting for bonding. 
The bonded material is not as strong as either concrete or rock, and engineers 
feared that the bonding may have been weakened by the intense heat from the 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures inside the tunnel reached about 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers took some of the bonded material -- from a section that had not been 
affected by heat -- to a laboratory where they planned to heat it and measure 
the loss of strength, if any. If that test shows little effect from the heat, 
Caltrans officials expressed more confidence about reopening the freeway 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Civil engineer Ed Kavazanjian of Earth Technologies Inc. in Los Angeles said 
that engineers have had little experience with the effects of heat on the 
grouting, but that "most likely" it would not be damaged by the heat. 
</P>
<P>
But the reopening date will not be determined, experts said, until engineers 
can get inside and inspect the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside, they will be looking for any evidence of settling, which would be 
an immediate indication that the safety of the freeway is threatened. If no 
visible evidence of danger appears, they are expected to bore holes into the 
compacted material to assess its strength and to remove samples for testing. 
</P>
<P>
The freeway itself is almost certainly not damaged, officials said, because of 
the insulating properties of the soil between it and the tunnel.

SETTING HIM STRAIGHT ON HISTORY OF COLTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Murray's account of the genealogy of the Indianapolis Colts is incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts were descended from the AAFC New York Yankees, not the NFL Boston 
Yanks (1944-48), which became the New York Bulldogs for the 1949 season. Both 
the AAFC Yankees and the NFL Yanks/Bulldogs existed simultaneously. After the 
1949 season, the Bulldogs were disbanded and the New York Yankees, Cleveland 
Browns, San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Colts were absorbed into the NFL, 
with the Colts dropping out after one year and the Yankees migrating to Dallas 
and then Baltimore.

In a recent story by Mark Heisler, he states Ben Wade is under the gun. 
</P>
<P>
This is so typical of the Dodger front office pass-the-buck attitude. For 
years, Al Campanis and Fred Claire traded away top talent for over-the-hill, 
injured, overpriced players; the minor league department forgot to develop the 
talent they had, and now they all blame the scouts. Just once, it would be 
refreshing for Fred Claire to admit making a mistake instead of pushing the 
blame elsewhere.

WET AND TIRED GEDDES LEADS U.S. WOMEN'S OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jane Geddes took the clubhouse lead at the U.S. Women's Open on Friday, but it 
took her 12 hours to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Geddes shot a two-over-par 74 in a soggy second round at the Atlanta Athletic 
Club at Duluth, Ga., that was interrupted three times by rain delays totaling 6 
hours 11 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The round was suspended because of darkness at 8:30 p.m., with 84 of the 156 
players on the course and another 18 golfers waiting to tee off. They will try 
to complete their second round this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Geddes, the 1986 Open champion, had shared the first-round lead with Patty 
Sheehan at 66 -- the best opening score in the history of the event. 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan, a three-time winner this season and the leading money winner on the 
LPGA Tour, didn't start her second round until 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Sheehan birdied the first hole to go to seven under, but she and playing 
partners Nancy Lopez and Colleen Walker completed only three holes before the 
round was suspended because of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
Walker, who shot an opening-round 69, birdied the first three holes Friday to 
go six-under for the tournament. Lopez, who opened with a 68, fell to 
three-under when she bogeyed the first hole Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I get to rest tomorrow, and they don't," Geddes said. "It'll be a long day for 
a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
Among those completing the second round were Betsy King and Pat Bradley. King, 
the defending champion, shot a 71 for a 143, while Bradley was at 144 after 
shooting a 70. 
</P>
<P>
Rosie Jones had a 70 and Meg Mallon 71 for 142 totals. Debbie Massey shot a 73 
and was tied with King at 143. Mary Murphy had a 74 for a 144 total. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Trevino made four consecutive birdies on the back nine to complete a 
six-under-par 65 for a share of the first-round lead with Dave Hill in the 
$600,000 Kroger Senior Classic on the Grizzly Course at the Jack Nicklaus 
Sports Center at Mason, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Jimenez, Walt Zembriski and John Paul Cain were one stroke back at 
five-under-par 66. At 67 were Rives McBee, Homero Blancas, Charles Coody, Jim 
Dent and George Archer. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a couple of mistakes today, and that's about it," Trevino said. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino barely missed a 12-footer on No. 18 that would have given him the 
outright lead. 
</P>
<P>
Two consecutive days of heavy rain had washed out the pro-am event and had 
threatened Friday's opening round. Trevino said that worked to his advantage, 
since he has been driving well and could afford to shoot for the pins on the 
soft greens. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mind the mud. All the major championships I won in this country have 
been in the mud," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hill liked the effect the rain had on the course. It made the greens "about my 
speed -- not real fast, not real slow." 
</P>
<P>
"I did something today I haven't done in a long time; I got eight birdies," 
Hill said. "I've never been a very good mudder. I'm surprised I played as well 
as I did today." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Verplank, a former U.S. Amateur and NCAA champion at Oklahoma State, shot 
three-under-par 68 at Pleasant Vally Country Club at Sutton, Mass., for a 
one-stroke lead over Larry Rinker at the halfway mark of the $900,000 Bank of 
Boston Classic. 
</P>
<P>
Rinker, winless in 10 years on the PGA Tour, shot a 65. Mike Smith, the 
first-round leader, slipped to 72 that left him at 137 with Brian Watts, Steve 
Pate, John Mahaffey, Bill Glasson and D.A. Weibring. 
</P>
<P>
Ian Woosnam of Wales shot a four-under par 67 and moved into a three-stroke 
lead in the Scottish Open at Gleneagles with a 54-hole total of 201. 
</P>
<P>
Woosnam began the round two strokes behind Gordon Brand Jr. of Scotland, but 
Brand stumbled to a 72 and fell into a second-place tie with Mark McNulty of 
Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
Derrick Cooper of England was fourth at 205 after a 68. He is the only player 
to record three sub-par scores for the tournament.

In June, when they seemed unbeatable, Roger Clemens and Mike Boddicker of the 
Boston Red Sox were being compared with other outstanding pitching duos. 
</P>
<P>
They had been largely responsible for the Red Sox climbing from third place in 
the American League East to a 4 1/2-game lead over Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
In June, Boddicker was 4-0 and in the middle of a 10-game winning streak. 
Clemens was 4-1 for the month. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, the two right-handers have faltered, and the Red Sox are struggling 
to stay ahead of the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Royals were without Bo Jackson, and Danny Tartabull pulled a groin 
muscle in the third inning, Kansas City jumped on Boddicker and the Red Sox, 
5-3. 
</P>
<P>
It was Boston's fifth loss in a row. Boddicker, who has lost two of the five, 
gave up 10 hits and four runs in seven innings. Clemens also has a loss in the 
string of defeats. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson, missing because of a death in the family, is not expected back for 
today's doubleheader with the Red Sox, and Tartabull will be out several games. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Macfarlane, who struck out the first two times he faced Boddicker, was 
successful the third time. The catcher hit a two-out, two-run single in the 
sixth inning to break a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
"As I stood in the on-deck circle," Macfarlane said, "I knew he would throw the 
curve that usually gets me. This time I got enough of it for a base hit. I had 
runners in scoring position every time. I guess I was due." 
</P>
<P>
Boddicker has lost two in a row since learning that after winning 10 in a row, 
he wasn't chosen for the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Gordon (6-6) was the winner, but the Red Sox had runners on second and 
third in the ninth inning when Jeff Montgomery retired Mike Greenwell with a 
grounder to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 3, New York 2 -- Greg Hibbard (7-5) said he was rather lucky to extend 
his string of unbeaten starts to seven in this game at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Hibbard gave up seven hits and both Yankee runs in seven innings before Barry 
Jones and Bobby Thigpen took over. Thigpen pitched the ninth inning for his 
28th save. 
</P>
<P>
An errant throw by Steve Sax contributed to the White Sox scoring in the fifth 
inning. After Scott Fletcher singled, Sax tried to catch him rounding first, 
but his throw went into the stands for a two-base error. 
</P>
<P>
Lance Johnson hit a sacrifice fly to drive in Fletcher with what proved to be 
the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore 8-1, Minnesota 5-3 -- Phil Bradley made an auspicious return from 
arthroscopic wrist surgery in the opening game of the doubleheader at 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
With the Orioles trailing, 5-4, and the bases loaded in the eighth inning, 
Bradley, batting for the first time since June 16, hit a grand slam to win the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins, getting sparkling pitching from David West (5-6) and Terry Leach, 
won the nightcap when Kent Hrbek and John Moses hit home runs. Hrbek also 
homered in the opener. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Milligan hit two home runs in the opener for the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
The Twins received a scare when starting pitcher Kevin Tapani was hit in the 
shin by a line drive hit by Joe Orsulak in the first inning. X-rays were 
negative and the nine-game winner is not expected to miss a turn. 
</P>
<P>
Texas 7, Detroit 6 -- Cecil Fielder hit his major league-leading 29th home run 
in the sixth inning at Detroit to give the Tigers a lead, but they couldn't 
hold it. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Incaviglia delivered the big hit for the Rangers. His three-run double 
keyed a four-run seventh inning that brought them from behind. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Witt, who is 4-1 in his last eight starts, needed help from the bullpen 
to win it. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Rogers earned his eighth save when he struck out Fielder and Gary Ward 
with runners on first and third. 
</P>
<P>
It was the sixth victory in a row for the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 2, Oakland 0 -- Mark Knudson (6-4) pitched a seven-hitter and Dave 
Parker hit his 12th home run at Oakland as the Brewers beat their nemesis, Dave 
Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who was 12-1 against the Brewers until he lost to them on July 4, has 
lost four of his last five decisions, two of them to the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat, in which Stewart (11-8) gave up seven hits in eight innings, cut 
Oakland's lead in the West to one game over Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland 13, Seattle 7 -- Sandy Alomar Jr. drove in four runs and the Indians 
scored eight runs in the seventh inning at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Candiotti (10-4) allowed just five hits in seven innings, but the Mariners, 
trailing, 13-1, scored six times in the bottom of the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians sent 11 batters to the plate in the seventh inning. DAN HAFNER

MGM/UA Communications Co.: The Culver City entertainment company said it had a 
$21.1-million net loss in its third-quarter, compared to a $7.1-million loss a 
year ago. Revenue fell 44% to $148.4 million. The firm said it incurred the 
latest loss "principally because of the expected and previously disclosed 
decrease in the number of feature films released this year."

SECOND IMPRESSIONS OF THE NEW PHANTOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIE DRAKE, TIMES THEATER WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There are no new surprises in "The Phantom of the Opera" now that Robert 
Guillaume has settled comfortably into the title role. 
</P>
<P>
A second visit reveals that he is making it sexier than it had been when he 
first took it over from Michael Crawford in May, battling a short rehearsal 
period and the unprecedented frenzy that had surrounded Crawford's exit. 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, there have been the inevitable letters received in this office from 
disgruntled theatergoers who insist there can be no other phantom but Crawford. 
But that's both predictable and untrue. 
</P>
<P>
Taking nothing away from Crawford, there have been xxxxxxxx 
</P>
<P>
artists -- in London and New York -- who have played the role of the Phantom as 
well as Crawford even if, not having created it, they garnered no similar 
glory. Guillaume is certainly proving an equally worthy successor who is also 
attempting to give the performance a more subjective stamp. More, perhaps, than 
even he had intended. 
</P>
<P>
As stated in The Times review that ran shortly after he opened in the show, 
Guillaume is an angrier, more anguished Phantom than Crawford had been. This 
has remained so. Paradoxically, there is less poignancy in the timbre of his 
voice, and (as an example) his reading of ". . . wandering child, so lost and 
helpless . . ." still sounds more like a grocery list than a love-struck 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
But the performance is an intriguing series of trade-offs, in which the 
Phantom's Svengaliesque control of Christine Daae (Dale Kristien, in full 
flower), as well as of the situation in general, is now coming through more 
clearly. 
</P>
<P>
It is easier to see why Christine is at once attracted and intimidated by this 
Phantom. Her genuine display of compassion for him, the double kiss she gives 
him at the end when all terror is gone, is a gesture of great kindness 
unmistakably rooted in sexual attraction. 
</P>
<P>
It provokes him to release her and her betrothed Raoul (Reece Holland) -- in 
the Phantom's only act of stunning generosity. 
</P>
<P>
This undeclared but undeniable obsession of Christine's helps get us through 
the one real credibility gap in this new "Phantom." But not entirely. While 
there's no question that one must suspend disbelief to sit through any part of 
this show (it is a fairy tale), the task is made harder by a curious decision 
regarding his disguise in Act II. 
</P>
<P>
When the Phantom has pressured the owners of the Paris Opera to stage his 
opera, they, with Raoul's help, decide to turn the occasion into a trap, 
stationing gendarmes everywhere, ready to pounce on the man at a moment's 
notice. So when the Phantom, hooded from head to toe, substitutes himself on 
stage for the portly tenor (Gualtiero Negrini), the intention, outwardly at 
least, is for him to not be recognized. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly not by the police. And yet Guillaume's elegant hands, which he is 
required to use elaborately in the scene, are a dead giveaway -- and it's 
equally clear that the man under the hood is not portly. One might accept that 
Christine would guess who he was at once and go along with the game out of 
paralyzing fear, but it takes an awful lot of confidence in color- and 
weight-blindness to believe that Raoul or the police would be so duped. 
</P>
<P>
This must be a choice on the producers' and director's part, but questionable. 
The argument in favor of it, one assumes, is that we should be able to 
transcend the evidence. The argument against it is that it unnecessarily forces 
a focus where it doesn't belong, when the entire matter could be settled with 
minimal padding and a simple pair of gloves. A disguise, after all, should be a 
complete disguise. 
</P>
<P>
This intrusion does the show -- and the actor -- a disservice, because, if 
Guillaume is to be commended for anything, it is for having taken this role and 
made it his own, without too much concern for those who have gone before. 
</P>
<P>
His Phantom doesn't whine. His Phantom has pride and rage, which are nobler, 
more troubling and more interesting emotions than others we've seen. Perhaps 
that's why the audience at the performance attended gave him a standing 
ovation. When you're watching a fairy tale, it's nice to be shown that it can 
be more than skin deep.

FACES . . . : GLENNE HEADLY: THE REAL PERSON BEHIND TRUEHEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For actress Glenne Headly, filling the stylish shoes of "Dick Tracy's" 
girlfriend Tess Trueheart was all in the name. "Warren told me he wanted me to 
live up to the character's name in the role. I think 'trueheart' suggests to me 
a a very caring and large-hearted woman, one that does things because she 
believes in them, because it's actually the character's credo." 
</P>
<P>
And although she read the comics, she admitted: "I didn't really get an idea of 
Tess from them because there wasn't that much of her in them. And the way the 
script was written, I think Tess had a lot more moxie than she seemed to have 
in the strip. I got a sense of style and the period from the comics, though." 
</P>
<P>
She was impressed by her co-star and boss, Warren Beatty. As a performer, 
Headly commented, "He was able to think of a lot of things going on 
production-wise, without ever showing that as an actor. He's pretty reticent on 
camera; he doesn't 'hog' it at all." 
</P>
<P>
And Beatty the director was no slouch either. "He would help to convey whatever 
I needed to, whether it was to be stronger or to be less so," she said. "He was 
a real guiding force." 
</P>
<P>
The actress, an alumnus of the High School for the Performing Arts in New York, 
honed her craft in theaters in San Francisco, Chicago and New York. She won a 
World Theatre Award as outstanding newcomer in Christopher Hampton's "The 
Philanthropist." "I think theater certainly honed my craft. But I love both 
movies and theater," she said. 
</P>
<P>
After "Dick Tracy" wrapped, Headly got a starring role as Joyce Urbanski in 
Alan Rudolph's film "Mortal Thoughts," which is due out in January, 1991. "My 
character's the complete antithesis of Tess. I play a strong, abrasive woman, a 
tough girl who grew up in a lower-middle-class background and is the wife of an 
abusive husband." 
</P>
<P>
And now? "I want some time off this summer to work on my house, stripping paint 
and sanding hardwood floors. I'd also like to work with black bears or bald 
eagles on work-study programs at a wildlife station. Last summer I worked with 
bighorn sheep in Wyoming and I loved it." SUE MARTIN

ETHNIC STEREOTYPES IN KCAL 'DICK TRACY' CARTOON SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I am a Japanese-American and I used to watch the Dick Tracy cartoon series when 
I was a kid growing up in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
It did not make me a racist. Richard Katsuda of the National Coalition for 
Redress and Reparations stated: "Cartoons like this can be destructive at an 
early age." Is he serious? 
</P>
<P>
My son, 6, and my daughter, 3 1/2, both love the cartoon series! The minority 
spokespersons do not speak for me and my children; let them dictate their 
narrow-minded views to their own families.

ETHNIC STEREOTYPES IN KCAL 'DICK TRACY' CARTOON SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Lynne Heffley's July 5 article on KCAL ("Asian and Latino groups are 
outraged by two characters in the revived 'Dick Tracy' cartoon series"): It's a 
shame that people spend so much time hunting for ethnic stereotypes. Wouldn't 
the time be better spent teaching their children not to hate or hurt? 
</P>
<P>
My 12-year-old son has a neurological disorder known as Tourette's Syndrome. 
This is a disease (not a form of retardation) that is controlled by medication. 
His teacher has made a valiant effort to educate his classmates (and their 
parents) about his disorder. But still my son has to cry himself to sleep over 
one word: retard. 
</P>
<P>
I was raised with violent and ethnically stereotyped cartoons, but I had one 
advantage. I was raised with a conscience. All parents have to do is teach 
their children the difference between right and wrong. Then we wouldn't need 
stereotype hunters anymore.

I read with shock and anger the July 5 account of the grand jury investigation 
of San Francisco photographer Jock Sturges ("Photo Lab Sets Off FBI Probe"). 
That the police can forcibly enter the home of a citizen, search and seize his 
possessions including his means of livelihood and then hold them for months 
without so much as filing charges is a chilling thought. 
</P>
<P>
That this power has now been used against an artist over an opinion of what 
constitutes pornography is outrageous.

FLAGS AND QUOTATIONS

<P>
Robert M. Ross, in his June 23 letter defending flag burning, quoted Samuel 
Adams as saying, "I disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death 
your right to say it." Voltaire is generally credited with an almost identical 
quotation. 
</P>
<P>
Francois Marie Arouet de Voltaire was born in 1694 and was 38 years old when 
Samuel Adams was born. 
</P>
<P>
However, the sentiment is a good one, and Ross will allow my right to say that 
with all of the serious problems today that require massive amounts of money, 
funding for the National Endowment for the Arts seems like a frivolous pursuit. 
How many geniuses has the NEA unearthed?

 Bartlett's "Familiar Quotations" says of "I disapprove of what you say, but I 
will defend to the death your right to say it": "This sentence is not 
Voltaire's but was first used in quoting a letter from Voltaire to Helvetius in 
'The Friends of Voltaire' (1906) by S.G. Tallentyre. She claims it was a 
paraphrase of Voltaire's words in the 'Essay on Tolerance': 'Think for yourself 
and let other enjoy the privilege to do so too.' "

POP BEAT / LASER DISCS: NEW TECHNOLOGY IS PUSHING THE PROCESS OF REDISCOVERY; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: THE IMPROVED SOUND AND PICTURE QUALITY OF LASER DISCS GIVES VINTAGE ROCK 
MOVIES A NEW KICK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the unexpected side effects of the compact disc revolution has been to 
make old albums seem fresh again. 
</P>
<P>
Even friends in the record business who almost never listen to old vinyl albums 
because they are so busy keeping up with new releases are making time to play 
old favorites when they arrive on CD. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a definite rediscovery process at work," said Pete Howard, publisher 
of ICE, a Santa Monica-based CD newsletter. "If the album has been remastered 
correctly, there is a strong possibility that you will hear instruments and 
music that you hadn't heard before on the vinyl record or cassette. So, it's a 
definite rebirth of some kind." 
</P>
<P>
The process now appears to be repeating itself with laser discs. Though most 
key, music-related films have been available on videocassette for years, the 
improved sound and picture quality of laser discs gives the films an immediacy 
that makes you you feel as if you are seeing them in a new light. 
</P>
<P>
The fascinating thing about seeing some of these films for the first time in a 
decade or more is how they stand up against your memory. 
</P>
<P>
Prince's "Purple Rain," for instance, was hailed by some critics in 1984 as the 
best rock movie ever -- a work that stepped far beyond the exploitation nature 
of most films in the genre. Yet it struck others as little more than an update 
of the early Elvis Presley movies -- say, "Jailhouse Rock." 
</P>
<P>
So how do the films compare today? "Purple Rain" and "Jailhouse Rock" are two 
of the four vintage films included in this look at music-related laser discs. 
Discs are rated on a scale of one (poor) to five (a classic). 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 "Jailhouse Rock" (MGM/UA). The makers of this 1957 film knew what they 
were selling. Elvis enters the movie within 11 seconds and the camera rarely 
leaves him in this predictable tale of the rise and temporary fall of a young 
rebel in the music business. 
</P>
<P>
The surprise, in view of the hapless nature of most of Elvis' later films, is 
how Presley exhibits fleeting signs of genuine acting talent. He was just 22 
when he made "Jailhouse Rock" and was clearly over his head as the lead in a 
film, but he shows at times the brooding intensity and charisma that he 
conveyed on stage. With discipline and guidance, he may well have evolved into 
the actor that he often said was his unrealized goal. 
</P>
<P>
*** "Purple Rain" (Warner Home Video) -- "Purple Rain" not only is far from a 
masterpiece, but it's also debatable whether it is even as good as "Jailhouse 
Rock." The Prince movie's greater ambition is more a sign of rock's increased 
status and power in the entertainment world in the '80s than a sign of Prince's 
skills as a filmmaker. Where Elvis was an actor going through a part outlined 
by Hollywood in "Jailhouse Rock," Prince had or shared control of virtually 
every aspect of this 1984 release. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the story -- another misunderstood Kid, searching for identity through 
music -- is ultimately as limited as that of "Jailhouse Rock," and Prince, for 
all his presence on stage, turns out to be a far weaker actor than Elvis. What 
gives the movie its sizzle is the concert footage. 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 "Performance" (Warner Home Video) -- Though Mick Jagger, in a teasing 
role as a decadent ex-rock star, was the selling point of this dark, unsettling 
1970 film, "Performance" was far too ambitious to be considered simply a rock 
exploitation movie. In fact, Jagger isn't even in the film for the first 40 
minutes. The opening sequence is a taut, brutal chronicle of a minor hoodlum 
(James Fox) who enjoys terrorizing shakedown victims until he becomes a target 
himself.

Looking for a place to hide, Fox stumbles into Jagger's bizarre world and 
becomes so caught up in the madness of drugs, sex and potential violence that 
he becomes as helpless as the victims he once tormented. A powerful but also 
confusing and indulgent film.

** 1/2 "Joe Cocker/Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen" (Pioneer Artists) -- Filmed a 
year after Woodstock, this concert documentary exudes some of the lingering 
flower-power ambience of the period, but the real treat is seeing Joe Cocker at 
his prime. Assisted by musical director/guru Leon Russell, the passionate 
British blues-rocker was such an engulfing performer that it's not at all 
unreasonable to think of him as the male Janis Joplin of the early '70s.

** 1/2 "Public Enemy: Fight the Power Live" (CMV Enterprises/Image) -- A

SMITHEREENS DELIVER RIGHT-LEFT COMBINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Louder, looser and sweatier than their records, the Smithereens blew through an 
hour-plus, more-killer-than-filler, end-o'-the-tour show at the Hollywood 
Palladium on Thursday before an adoring if not quite capacity crowd. 
</P>
<P>
With his gleaming pate, hawk nose and Vandyke beard, Pat DiNizio looks more 
like a demented biker poet than the frontman in a POP! group. 
</P>
<P>
His three cohorts look about as exciting as a box of rocks, too. 
</P>
<P>
Ah . . . but when it all comes down to that right-left combination of 
craftsmanship and raunch, these Jersey devils whip every glamourpussed 
power-pop group that's packed the pipe in the last 18 years where it counts -- 
in the wallet. 
</P>
<P>
So the hits after semi-hits after hits after semi-hits just kept right on 
comin'. And if not all of them are up to the shimmering, shattering, mindbust 
status of the '87 career breakthrough numbers "Behind the Wall of Sleep" and 
"Blood and Roses," they've still got the kind of hooks you can't forget. DON

CHURCH SOUNDS GOOD BUT COVERS LITTLE GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's hard to imagine the Church giving a better account of itself than it did 
on Thursday at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, in a set that was 
glistening, brooding, forceful and extremely well-played. But when the nearly 
two-hour show was over, one had to wonder how a band could develop for 10 years 
and cover so little ground. 
</P>
<P>
Like U2 and R.E.M., the Church spent the 1980s refining a musical personality 
that was distinctive, but narrow. The Australian band's small parcel of sonic 
and emotional space combines U2's urgent belfry chime and R.E.M.'s dreamy web 
of murmuring voices and guitars. 
</P>
<P>
Bassist Steve Kilbey sang with muted yet convincing emotion in a voice full of 
tasteful reserve. Guitarists Peter Koppes and Marty Willson-Piper played 
glancing, finely etched parts that often used distortion effects and echo to 
evoke an encompassing rush of wind. Kilbey's bass-thrum and the solid, active 
drumming of Jay Dee Daugherty ensured that the band's most gauze-like textures 
always rested on a firm, rock pulse. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of the versatility and striking contrasts that mark the work of the 
best rockers of the '60s and '70s, the Church could vary its basic ritual only 
by subtle shadings and small gradations. It may be more than coincidence that 
Kilbey's outlook as a lyricist tends to be exceedingly bleak, frequently 
depicting a diminished world of stark limits. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Aeroplanes' 50-minute opening set frequently sounded like a tribute to 
the Velvet Underground, but the British band's performance and Gerard Langley's 
half-sung, half-spoken dramatic monologues had enough zest and quirky immediacy 
to take on their own life. 
</P>
<P>
The same bill returns to the Coach House tonight and also plays Sunday at the 
Ventura Theatre, Monday at the Wiltern Theatre and Tuesday at San Diego State 
University's Montezuma Hall. MIKE BOEHM

GOOD INTENTIONS, POOR EXECUTION IN 'DANCING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now here's a peculiar title -- "Dancing the God." Playwright Patricia Montley 
has attached it to her play about the uncodifiable feelings and lessons that 
pass between a dance teacher and her student. It refers, clearly, to the 
student's interest in Hindu dance ritual, and, less clearly, to the teacher's 
wish for spiritual fulfillment through dance. 
</P>
<P>
In other words, Montley is after the mystery in this process. But at the 
Burbage Theatre under Ivan Spiegel's direction, the mystery is made literal, 
laid out for us like so many legal documents. 
</P>
<P>
Montley's device for exploring her mystery is the student (Patricia Ponton) 
bringing up sexual harassment charges against the teacher (Katherine McGregor). 
The arbitrator is a self-assured lawyer representing the college (Debbie 
Devine), and though she insists to McGregor that she isn't her enemy, Devine 
spends a lot of time cross-examining her. 
</P>
<P>
"Agnes of God" in leotards, then? Not quite, since the issues here are about 
such un-godlike matters as women's unspoken erotic desires for each other, a 
teacher's pet as a teacher's surrogate and how emotions and creativity can feed 
or impede one another. But "Agnes' " clunky narrative form (flash-forward to 
investigation, flash-back to the events) and archly dialectical dialogues clog 
the play's better intentions. What stops things cold is the shaky execution of 
ballet steps, Maureen Kennedy Samuels' dance-by-numbers choreography, and the 
cast's flat reading, especially Devine's humorless, stridently serious 
inquisitor.

'Jack of All Trades' Is Master of None 
</P>
<P>
When L.A. vanity productions get truly vain, they send out a creepiness like 
nothing else Hollywood serves up. The particular creepiness of 
writer-director-star John Fraser Cullen's "Jack of All Trades," at the Richmond 
Shepard Theatre, is Cullen's belief that he can (a) put on a show, (b) use it 
as a repository for a scattershot selection of his own songs and (c) make 
something meaningful out of it. 
</P>
<P>
Cullen plays a Vegas blackjack dealer, but he's really a stand-in for God, 
compelling the players around the table to reveal their past sins or tragedies. 
There is no book and no spine either, just a sloppy display of songs that sound 
stuck in disco hell (and deeper), fully deserving of the singers who sing them. 
We'll pass.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; 
</P>
<P>
OPENING DOORS TO HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With 8,000 to 10,000 people homeless in Orange County -- half of them children 
-- six new apartment units may not do much to meet the need for housing. But to 
the families involved, they represent a fresh chance to get on surer economic 
footing in the face of housing costs that are out of sight for many. For that 
reason, HomeAid, a year-old, nonprofit program sponsored by the Building 
Industry Assn., is something to be celebrated and praised. 
</P>
<P>
The BIA, a trade association best known for its strong pro-growth stance on 
development, announced a year ago it would fund a $1-million effort to help the 
homeless. HomeAid subsequently renovated shelters for the homeless or abused 
women in Garden Grove, Midway City, San Clemente and Fullerton. Soon, it will 
open its first newly constructed facility, a $350,000, six-unit complex in El 
Modena. All told, HomeAid says it has added 114 beds to the county's low-cost 
housing stock. The HomeAid projects provide transitional living quarters for 
people who need help temporarily while they save enough money to get apartments 
of their own. 
</P>
<P>
But the need is much greater. The county is short by 4,500 transitional units 
alone, and there's an even greater need for permanent low-cost housing for 
people to move into once they are self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
While what it has done so far is praiseworthy, Orange County's building 
industry could do more. It's in a unique position to be able to put together 
public/private partnerships to provide low-cost housing, such as single-room 
occupancy hotels or inexpensive apartments, for those on the lower end of the 
economic scale. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people in Orange County have lost their homes through illness, job 
loss, divorce or other setbacks. HomeAid represents the first major effort by 
private industry to help solve the homeless problem in Orange County. It is a 
model of commitment worth expanding and following.

SOVIET ARRIVAL: U.S. AIR FORCE SCRAMBLES WHEN GUEST PLANES SHOW UP A DAY 
EARLIER THAN EXPECTED.

Three Soviet planes have arrived in Seattle for the Goodwill Games, but not 
before surprising the U.S. Air Force, which was expecting them a day later and 
had to scramble jets to intercept them over Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
An Ilyushin-62 passenger plane carrying Goodwill Games visitors and alternative 
Soviet art, accompanied by two SU-27 military jet fighters, left the Soviet 
Union Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The planes had been delayed leaving Moscow for a day, then delayed again when 
they stopped to refuel in the Soviet Far East. 
</P>
<P>
"We were afraid that they would close the border for us, so we left today, the 
day before we were scheduled to take off," said Nina Walsh, the Soviet-born 
wife of Bob Walsh, president of the Seattle Organizing Committee for the 
Olympic-style games and a passenger on the airliner. 
</P>
<P>
The Ilyushin had been cleared to leave Wednesday, but its two escorts had 
permission for Friday, Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots took a chance and all three planes left the Soviet Union, crossing 
over at a remote strategic point where communications are poor, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem was, when they crossed the international date line, they dropped 
back to Thursday -- the day before they had been permitted entry to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. fighter planes intercepted them about 100 miles northwest of Nome, Alaska, 
and escorted them to Elmendorf Air Force Base near Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unbelievable," Walsh said of the four aircraft -- two Soviet, two 
American -- flying next to the Ilyushin. 
</P>
<P>
The planes flew close and changed positions around the passenger aircraft, she 
said. "We took hundreds of pictures. The escort pilots weren't supposed to talk 
to each other, but we could tell they were understanding each other." 
</P>
<P>
"We had picked them up on long-range radar as unknown tracks. We knew what they 
were when we went up to get them," Capt. Monica Aloisio, spokeswoman for the 
Air Force, said of the Soviet planes. "But we were expecting them tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
The planes stayed at Elmendorf until late Thursday, unable to get State 
Department permission to proceed to Seattle. Bob Walsh called Andy Card, 
special assistant to President Bush, and Card called the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet and American pilots and their families mingled at an Air Force 
luncheon while they waited. 
</P>
<P>
Escorted by two U.S. F-15 fighter planes, the three planes finally arrived in 
Seattle Thursday night.

BASEBALL: DODGER OUTFIELDER GETS A KEY PINCH-HIT IN A 5-2 VICTORY OVER THE 
CUBS. IF GIBSON IS DEALT, A STARTER'S ROLE MIGHT RESULT. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Stan Javier proved Friday that Kirk Gibson's trade demands can be a distraction 
to his Dodger teammates. 
</P>
<P>
A pleasant, game-winning distraction. 
</P>
<P>
Javier acknowledged that the news of Gibson's possible departure has made him 
think about his chances of becoming the regular center fielder. Warmed by that 
hope, he stepped into the cold wind in the ninth inning and hit a pinch 
run-scoring single against the Chicago Cubs' Shawn Boskie to break a 2-2 tie 
and help the Dodgers to a 5-2 victory before 31,438 at Wrigley Field. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of talk going on; I know something is going to happen, and I 
want to be ready when it does," Javier said after helping Ramon Martinez win 
his 10th game, while the Dodgers improved to 4-0 here this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a good feeling that things are going to work out for me here," Javier 
said. "I don't know when or where or how . . . but something is going to work 
out." 
</P>
<P>
If so, it will be because of days like this, when Javier was summoned to bat 
for Martinez with two out in the ninth inning and pinch-runner Jose Vizcaino on 
second base after a leadoff double by Mike Scioscia. 
</P>
<P>
Javier could have entered the game sulking. He has been benched since Gibson's 
recovery from injuries, even though Javier was hitting .328 in his first 40 
games as a Dodger since being trade by the Oakland Athletics May 12. 
</P>
<P>
But he does not sulk, he studies. By the time he stepped in against Boskie, 
Javier had watched the rookie and made an educated guess about what he would be 
throwing. 
</P>
<P>
"I had been talking to everybody about him during the game, and just before me, 
I saw him throw Alfredo (Griffin) a couple of changeups, and I thought, that 
might be what I see," Javier said. 
</P>
<P>
On Boskie's third pitch, Javier lofted a changeup to center field, scoring 
Vizcaino. After Mitch Williams replaced Boskie, Lenny Harris singled and Gibson 
got his third hit of the game, a two-run double to complete the scoring. Jay 
Howell finished with a perfect ninth inning for his second save in two days and 
sixth overall. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to have that one pitch back," said Boskie, who is 3-5 with a 3.76 
earned-run average in his first 10 major league starts. "My changeup is my 
second- or third-best pitch, and you hate to get beat with that." 
</P>
<P>
But the way Javier deals with those pressure at-bats, Boskie might have thrown 
him anything and still lost. 
</P>
<P>
"Up there as a pinch-hitter in that situation, I don't have anything to lose," 
said Javier, who has two hits in six at-bats as a pinch-hitter. "If you get a 
hit, you are a hero. If you don't get a hit, it's just another out. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish every time I would pinch-hit, it would be in that situation." 
</P>
<P>
What Javier really wishes is that he would not have to pinch-hit. Although he 
has been outwardly calm, he said Friday that he has not been happy since being 
told recently by Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda that as long as his three veteran 
outfielders can play, Javier would be benched. That outfield also includes Kal 
Daniels, who doubled and scored Friday, and Hubie Brooks, whose single drove in 
Daniels for the Dodgers' first run. 
</P>
<P>
"I get mad every time I'm not in the lineup, sure," said Javier, 24. "But I 
think everybody ought to be mad every day they are not in the lineup. If you're 
not mad, you're stealing money. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't know I am mad. I take it easy. I be cool. I wait for something to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda likes Javier's attitude. If Gibson is traded, Javier could be given the 
chance to prove himself as a regular. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a big, big base hit," Lasorda said of Javier's pinch-hit. "Like all 
of our young kids, he likes to play; he understands what has happened so that 
he can't play every day, and he is working hard. I like that." 
</P>
<P>
Another young Dodger, Martinez, lowered his ERA to 3.14, giving up only five 
hits in eight innings. With Joe Girardi on third base and two out in the 
eighth, Martinez struck out All-Star Ryne Sandberg, after Sandberg had hit four 
consecutive foul balls. 
</P>
<P>
For Martinez, 22, it was a confrontation and victory similar to one against 
Oakland's Jose Canseco on this field Tuesday night in the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
"To be able to show so much composure at such a young age, that shows you what 
kind of pitcher he is going to be," said catcher Mike Scioscia, who also caught 
Martinez in the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
Said Martinez: "I know Sandberg can hit almost any pitch. So I throw him a lot 
of stuff -- fastball, curveball, changeup -- and make sure I make no mistake." 
</P>
<P>
After Martinez fell behind, 2-0, on RBIs by Girardi and Marvell Wynne, the 
Dodgers tied the score in the sixth inning on Daniels' double, a walk to Eddie 
Murray and a line drive to left field by Brooks that scored both runners when 
right fielder Andre Dawson threw wildly to second base when Brooks apparently 
surprised him by going for a double. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Detroit General Manager Bill Lajoie has privately expressed confidence that he 
can acquire outfielder Kirk Gibson by the end of next week. The Dodgers remain 
interested in pitcher Steve Searcy, who was recalled from the Tigers' triple-A 
team July 7 and is scheduled to make his first major league start of the season 
Sunday against the Texas Rangers. Searcy, a left-hander who has been the 
Tigers' top prospect for several years, has made one appearance in relief, 
giving up a run in two innings. 
</P>
<P>
Dodger pitcher Ramon Martinez is still smiling about retiring the Oakland 
Athletics' Jose Canseco. "That was a lot of fun -- I was throwing all 
fastballs, and he was swinging at everything," Martinez said of the six-pitch 
battle that ended in a weak grounder to second base by Canseco. Martinez's 
second pitch sailed underneath Canseco's chin, which Martinez also remembered 
as fun. "As soon as I throw it, I hear all the fans yelling, 'Ohhhh,' and I see 
Canseco walking around looking at me. . . . It was something," Martinez said. 
"But I don't just throw inside to get him, I throw inside to everybody. I don't 
change for him." 
</P>
<P>
Tim Belcher threw for the first time Friday since receiving a cortisone shot 
Sunday in his right shoulder. He said his arm felt stronger than usual, adding 
that he will make his scheduled start Sunday. . . . Reliever Pat Perry threw 
off a mound Friday for the first time since going on the disabled list June 10 
because of shoulder tendinitis. He said he felt good but does not want to rush 
his return, as he did earlier this season, when he came off the disabled list 
May 24 and broke down again a week later after pitching three consecutive days 
in St. Louis and Pittsburgh. If he continues to feel good, he will throw on the 
side for a couple of weeks before returning to the minor leagues for two weeks 
of rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
The funeral for Merritt Willey, former Dodger marketing director, will be 
Tuesday at 11 a.m. at Church of the Recessional at Forest Lawn in Glendale. In 
lieu of flowers, the family has requested donations to charity.

NEWSWIRE: RED WINGS REPLACE DEMERS WITH FORMER CAPITAL COACH MURRAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Detroit Red Wings fired Jacques Demers as coach Friday and hired former 
Washington Capital coach Bryan Murray to be both coach and general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, 47, had guided the Capitals to the playoffs in seven of his nine full 
seasons, but his team never advanced past the second round. He was fired and 
replaced by his younger brother, Terry, in January. 
</P>
<P>
In four seasons under Demers, the Red Wings qualified three times for the 
playoffs, advancing twice to the semifinals before losing both times to the 
Edmonton Oilers. Last season, the Red Wings finished last in the Norris 
Division with 70 points.

The track and field competition slowed to a walk in the U.S. Olympic Festival 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Debbi Lawrence of Kenosha, Wis., broke her American record in the 10-kilometer 
race walk, and two-time Olympian Carl Schueler won a 20-kilometer event that 
wound up being shorter than planned. 
</P>
<P>
Also Friday, Wendy Lian Williams and defending champion Matt Scoggin won the 
10-meter platform preliminaries. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence finished her race in 46 minutes 10.26 seconds, breaking the American 
record of 46:14.4 she set in The Athletics Congress meet June 15. She also 
broke the Festival record of 47:54.0 by Maryanne Torrellas of Clinton, Conn., 
in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Lawrence, 28, got an assist from the crowd, which gave her a standing ovation 
throughout her last lap. She covered the final 400 meters in 1:45 after going 
at a 1:51 pace for most of the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I wanted it bad enough that it (the crowd) wouldn't have made any 
difference," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Schueler knew early on that something was amiss in the 20-kilometer race. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been racing for 12 years, so when we came through the first lap at the 2 
1/2-kilometer mark I saw the clock and knew the course was short," Schueler 
said. "When six guys are on world-record pace at 2 1/2 kilometers, you know 
something is not right." 
</P>
<P>
The course was inadvertently laid out to cover 18.230 kilometers. Schueler, of 
Colorado Springs, Colo., won the race in 1 hour 18 minutes 59 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Henson, the U.S. Olympic Committee's commissioner of athletics, said 
turnaround cones for the race were mistakenly placed at the wrong marker of 
what was supposed to be a 2 1/2-kilometer loop. The error shortened the loop by 
about 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
"After it was discovered, they considered extending it another lap," Henson 
said. "But the referee felt that would be too confusing to the athletes." 
</P>
<P>
National champion Meredith Rainey of New York won the 800 meters in 2:03.40, 
overtaking silver medalist Celeste Halliday of Bloomfield, Conn., in the final 
50 meters. 
</P>
<P>
In diving, Williams easily finished first in the 10-meter platform 
preliminaries in her first festival appearance since 1985. The 447.69 points 
were a personal preliminary best for Williams, a 1988 Olympic bronze medalist. 
</P>
<P>
Her closest pursuer was Cokey Smith of Ann Arbor, Mich., the only competitor 
whose eight-dive total (381.15) exceeded Williams' score after seven dives 
(372.93). 
</P>
<P>
Scoggin, of Austin, Tex., won the men's preliminary round with a 628.86, taking 
the lead with a near-perfect dive in the next-to-last round. He was awarded 
three 10s and four 9.5s for an inward 3 1/2 somersault in the tuck position. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Morse of Miami was second with 574.35 and Pat Jeffery of Madison, N.J., 
was third at 572.37.

Shane Beschen has felt the pressure of being a favorite on the Professional 
Surfing Assn. of America this year, so playing the underdog role at the Life's 
A Beach surfing competition Friday was a welcome relief. 
</P>
<P>
Beschen of San Clemente, seeded 31st, upset second-seeded Dave Maccaulay of 
Cowaramup Bay, Australia, 99.8 to 88, in the second round at the Oceanside 
Pier. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second consecutive upset for Beschen, who beat 18th-seeded Glen 
Winton of Norah Head, Australia, in Thursday's first round. 
</P>
<P>
Beschen competes regularly on the PSAA's U.S. tour, but has joined the Assn. of 
Surfing Professionals world tour for its stops at Oceanside this weekend and 
the Op Pro at Huntington Beach July 30-Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
"Last year, I was an underdog on the PSAA tour," said Beschen, who is third in 
the U.S. point standings. "No one expected me to do anything. But this year, I 
led the point standings for a while and the whole focus of the tour turned to 
me. 
</P>
<P>
"When I come to these (world tour) contests, it's like starting all over again. 
Nobody knows who you are." 
</P>
<P>
Ninth-seeded Richie Collins of Newport Beach was the only other Orange County 
surfer to advance to today's third round. Jeff Booth of Laguna Beach and Matt 
Archbold of San Clemente were eliminated Friday. The finals are set for Sunday 
at noon. MIKE REILLEY

3 ON COUNCIL HIRE LAWYER IN REMAP FIGHT; 
</P>
<P>
GOVERNMENT: FILNER, HARTLEY AND BERNHARDT EXPRESS CONCERN THAT CITY ATTORNEY'S 
OFFICE COULD NOT ADEQUATELY REPRESENT THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY M. HORSTMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frustrated over growing legal woes surrounding the city's redistricting plan, 
three of the five San Diego City Council members who tentatively approved the 
measure hired an outside lawyer Friday to replace the city attorney as their 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
In what the private lawyer himself described as a "highly unusual situation," 
council members Bob Filner, John Hartley and Linda Bernhardt retained David 
Lundin to represent them in possible legal proceedings involving the redrawing 
of council district boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
As members of the prevailing council majority that gave conceptual approval to 
a redistricting map Monday -- igniting a controversy that led to multiple 
federal court hearings over the next three days -- Filner, Hartley and 
Bernhardt normally would be represented by the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
However, dissatisfied with the city attorney's performance, and with critical 
court hearings scheduled for later this month, the three decided to retain 
Lundin -- a move that city lawyers have emphasized will come at the council 
members' own expense. 
</P>
<P>
"Our clients' perception is that there's a problem . . . with the city attorney 
trying to represent the council as a whole when the council is so divided," 
Lundin said. "Basically, they felt the city attorney could not adequately 
represent their position." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, his own efforts, Lundin stressed, "certainly should complement" 
those of the city attorney in the redistricting case. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a federal magistrate delayed until July 23 any council action on 
the plan, which Latino activists contend illegally dilutes minority voting 
strength and violates the settlement of a 1988 Chicano Federation lawsuit 
challenging the constitutionality of the city's electoral system. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the council, which originally planned to move toward formal adoption of 
that map next week, reverses itself and approves an alternative proposal 
developed by a citizens advisory board, further court review of the plan is a 
certainty, U.S. Magistrate Harry McCue said. 
</P>
<P>
"I suspect Mr. Filner wasn't real happy with what happened," said Assistant 
City Atty. Curtis Fitzpatrick, offering his explanation for the legal switch. 
Although the plan that was passed by a 5-4 council vote Monday was introduced 
by Hartley, Filner is widely regarded as one of its major architects. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe he feels we weren't as assiduous as he'd like in our advocacy, even 
though I'd have to say we were," Fitzpatrick said. "But, if (Lundin) can be 
more persuasive with the judge, more power to him." 
</P>
<P>
For each of the three council members who hired Lundin, Hartley's plan offers 
political advantages over the advisory board's proposal, creating boundaries 
more to their liking. Indeed, under the advisory panel's plan, the new or 
future homes of both Filner and Bernhardt were left outside the proposed 
realignment of their respective districts. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond their unhappiness with the outcome of the preliminary legal skirmishing 
over the redistricting plan, the three also were angered by the fact that their 
first detailed explanation of the magistrate's order came via newspaper stories 
Friday, not from city attorneys, Lundin said. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing that resulted in McCue's order, however, ended late Thursday after 
most council members had left City Hall. Deputy City Atty. Kenneth So said 
that, although he tried to contact the council members Thursday night, Ron 
Roberts -- who voted against Monday's plan -- was the only one he reached. 
Fitzpatrick added that the city attorney's office sent a memo on McCue's order 
to the council offices Friday. 
</P>
<P>
None of the three council members who retained Lundin returned telephone calls 
Friday. The two other members who supported Monday's redistricting plan -- Abbe 
Wolfsheimer and Wes Pratt -- are lawyers and have not sought outside counsel. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, when the city attorney's potential conflict in representing a badly 
divided council was discussed in court earlier in the week, U.S. District Judge 
John Rhoades' major concern appeared to be whether the council's minority could 
receive adequate representation. 
</P>
<P>
With the city attorney's office obliged to represent the position of the 
five-vote council majority, Rhoades asked, how could it simultaneously defend 
the other four members' interests? In a letter to Rhoades, Councilman Bruce 
Henderson raised the same concern, suggesting that those four members also 
might eventually need private lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's maneuvering over which attorneys should represent whom seemed an 
appropriate end to a week in which the redistricting plan spent more time in 
court than at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Hartley's plan reduces the Latino composition of Filner's 8th District from the 
advisory board's 52.2% to at most 51%, and perhaps less, as well as 
dramatically alters the configuration of a number of other council districts. 
Based on some estimates, the plan would change council representation for up to 
300,000 San Diegans. 
</P>
<P>
To date, however, the two sides' court debate has focused more on how Monday's 
council vote occurred than on the content of the redistricting plan itself. In 
particular, Chicano Federation officials argue that the council's approval of 
Hartley's plan, only hours after it was publicized, denied them a meaningful 
voice in its development, as guaranteed by an agreement that settled the first 
stage of the group's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Those procedural questions prompted McCue to order the council to reconsider 
both Hartley's plan and the advisory board's map when it resumes debate on the 
subject July 23. 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to McCue's order, several council members suggested Friday that the 
council might hold several public hearings on the plans before formally voting 
on either or perhaps adopting an amended version later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
"In retrospect, we could have avoided some of the outcry if this had been 
handled differently," Pratt said. "But, in one way, the judge has done the 
council a favor by giving us a chance to sit back for a week or so to reflect. 
When we go through it all over again, who knows whether the result will be the 
same or change? But, at least, the process will be better."

PUC SAYS MERGER HEARINGS TO END AUG. 3; FOES PROTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state Public Utilities Commission, responding to a request by Southern 
California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, on Friday directed its 
staff to end hearings on the controversial merger by Aug. 3. 
</P>
<P>
Although utility spokesmen applauded the ruling, merger opponents said the 
decision will keep them from fully exploring whether the merger would be 
beneficial to Southern Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents also suggested that the decision to close testimony on Aug. 3 will 
open the door to lawsuits should the commission approve the merger. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) said Friday that the PUC has 
violated state law by "arbitrarily rushing the . . . merger proceeding based on 
the commission's desire to reach a decision by the end of 1990." 
</P>
<P>
"This could come back to haunt the PUC," warned Bill Shaffran, a city of San 
Diego attorney who has long represented the city in the merger review. Shaffran 
said the PUC action will prohibit merger opponents, such as the city, from 
completing their cases. 
</P>
<P>
Edison spokesman Lew Phelps, however, praised the decision. 
</P>
<P>
"In a nutshell, we view this as a positive development," he said. "These 
hearings have been going on for . . . a very long time, and it looks as though 
it's going to be two years . . . before it's brought to a close. We think 
that's long enough." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Strumwasser, a Los Angeles-based special assistant to state Atty. Gen. 
John Van de Kamp, who has opposed the merger, said the attorney general's 
office is "increasingly worried that, whatever the commission decides would be 
(negated) because it can be overturned in court because of procedural errors." 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners restricted the hearing's length in order to complete 
deliberations and issue a decision by Dec. 31. The commission hopes to finish 
the case by then because two commissioners' terms expire at year's end, and it 
could be months before their replacements are familiar with the complicated 
case. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal, in a prepared statement Friday, complained that "the commission's 
blind adherence to an arbitrary year-end deadline appears to have crossed the 
line from expeditious review to a violation of the basic rights of interested 
parties." 
</P>
<P>
Rosenthal said he intends to hold hearings on the PUC's merger review to 
determine if the commission has fully explored environmental impacts of the 
proposed merger and whether the merger would produce benefits for Southern 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Strumwasser also questioned the PUC's desire to move so quickly to complete the 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's order "has the suggestion of pre-judgment," he said. "Why are they in 
such a hurry? Is it because (they) don't need to hear the evidence because they 
already know what's going to happen?" 
</P>
<P>
Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers Action Network, a 
consumer group that opposes the merger, said the PUC decision is "not as bad as 
I expected." 
</P>
<P>
Shames based that opinion on the fact that commissioners had been considering 
an allocation plan that would have divided remaining hearing time among the 
utilities and opponents. That would have been "devastating" to merger 
opponents, who need time to cross-examine utility officials, Shames said. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC instead extended daily hearing times and added six hours of testimony, 
to be taken on Saturdays. The administrative law judges who are conducting the 
hearings will also take steps to speed cross-examination of utility company 
witnesses, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Shames said, the time limit puts opponents of the merger at a 
disadvantage because, even with longer weekday sessions and additional Saturday 
sessions, "we're not going to get the time we need" to complete 
cross-examinations. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Weismehl, an attorney with the PUC's Division of Ratepayer Advocates, the 
San Francisco-based organization that represents the public in the merger, 
described the six-day workweek as unprecedented in the PUC's history. 
</P>
<P>
"My staff is already suffering from fatigue," said Weismehl, who was home sick 
with a cold Friday. "This is incredibly burdensome to our staff. . . . We'll 
have to see what happens. As everyone gets very tired, the quality of 
presentations may go down." 
</P>
<P>
Fatigue will hurt the DRA, which has six attorneys working on the case, more 
than the utilities, which have mustered a legal force that includes more than 
two dozen attorneys, Weismehl said. 
</P>
<P>
"For Edison, the accelerated schedule and the longer days are not that much of 
a big deal," Weismehl said.

Brother Benno's soup kitchen, acclaimed for its compassion for the poor, soon 
may leave downtown Oceanside, where neighbors have complained that the 
establishment attracts drunks and loiterers. 
</P>
<P>
The Brother Benno's Foundation, that has run the eatery in an old house on 
Minnesota Street since 1983, has applied for a city permit to operate an 
expanded facility in an industrial area near Oceanside Municipal Airport. 
</P>
<P>
After attempts to move elsewhere downtown failed, the foundation hopes a new 
location outside downtown will end the criticism and allow Brother Benno's to 
grow from a soup kitchen into a place where homeless people also can shower, 
enjoy a day room and receive counseling. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not going to be in anybody's back yard," said city Housing Director 
Richard Goodman, who believes that the industrial site is much better than 
keeping Brother Benno's downtown, near a blood center, a transit station and 
county welfare offices. 
</P>
<P>
"For a long time, there's been concern that too many facilities downtown keep 
(homeless) people in that area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The city Planning Commission will decide later this month whether to grant 
Brother Benno's a conditional-use permit for the Production Avenue site, off 
Mission Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers at Brother Benno's now dish up free dinners to about 225 people a 
night, but neighbors and city police have claimed that some homeless patrons 
sleep on private property, burglarize and litter. 
</P>
<P>
The foundation has explored moving into other neighborhoods, but opposition has 
kept Brother Benno's out. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Lundquist, a soup kitchen volunteer and a foundation member, believes the 
proposed site on Production Avenue will improve the situation. 
</P>
<P>
First, dinner no longer will be served because "there's more of a problem with 
alcohol at the evening meal." Instead, Brother Benno's, starting in October if 
the city permit is approved, will provide breakfast and a sack lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Hours of operation are expected to be roughly 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., closing 
earlier than it does now to dissuade patrons from loitering in the area after 
they've eaten, showered or used the day room. 
</P>
<P>
Initially, Brother Benno's only will offer meals. Lundquist isn't sure when the 
additional services, including job and education counseling, will begin. 
</P>
<P>
According to Goodman, "there is some opposition" to Brother Benno's relocation 
plans, but "not nearly as strong" as before, when the foundation sought to move 
into residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
The most vocal opponents are the owners of Marty's Valley Inn on Mission 
Avenue, where Marty Schroder Jr. is concerned that Brother Benno's patrons will 
trespass and disturb the guests. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are they going to go? They're going to be in my hotel, in my garbage 
rack," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schroder said some homeless people already have caused trouble at the inn, 
which recently underwent a $1.5-million renovation. 
</P>
<P>
"Would you want a bunch of homeless people trampling on your front doorstep?" 
he asked. 
</P>
<P>
However, Lundquist said an "unenlightened attitude" is behind the fear of the 
people served by Brother Benno's. 
</P>
<P>
He said many patrons are women, children and working men who are too poor to 
afford food. "We're not just there for the street homeless," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Goodman said he will try to meet with the Schroders to discuss their concerns.

DEFENSE LAWYER SUES TO LIFT BAN ON PRISON VISITS; 
</P>
<P>
LAWSUIT: ACTION BY ALEX LANDON CHALLENGES A DIRECTIVE STEMMING FROM A 1972 
PRISON BREAK THAT BARS HIM FROM SEEING JAILED CLIENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego criminal defense lawyer Alex Landon has sued state prison officials 
to compel an end to a 17-year-old directive that bars him from prison grounds, 
claiming the ban is unjustified and unfairly keeps him from visiting clients 
behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
The ban, prompted by allegations tying Landon to a 1972 Chino jailbreak, was 
imposed without cause because no reliable evidence has ever linked Landon to 
wrongdoing in the escape, according to the suit, filed last week in Marin 
County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Prison officials, however, consistently have declined to explain why the ban 
was imposed and have never allowed Landon to contest it at a hearing, according 
to the suit. Since the ban remains in effect, it denies Landon's right to work 
at his profession and his clients' rights to attorney access, the suit claims. 
</P>
<P>
One of those clients is David Allen Lucas, convicted last year in San Diego of 
three murders and now on Death Row at San Quentin. In a separate but related 
action, Lucas also filed suit last week in Marin County -- where San Quentin is 
situated -- asking that the ban on Landon be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
Landon, who has built a practice dedicated to protecting the rights of poor 
people charged with crimes, has long maintained that the ban is based on 
political considerations. "I have faith in the courts that they will correct 
the injustice," he said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The ban had largely been forgotten until two years ago, when San Diego County 
supervisors were pondering whether to award the nonprofit group Landon then 
headed a $40-million contract to represent indigent criminal defendants. Early 
in 1988, Landon formally asked prison officials for the first time to lift the 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, then-Assemblyman Larry Stirling (R-San Diego), now a San 
Diego Municipal Court judge, sent a pack of documents to supervisors that told 
of the ban. In May, 1988, the board reversed its decision to award the contract 
to Landon's group and voted instead to launch an in-house public defenders 
office. 
</P>
<P>
The ban stems from allegations that have dogged Landon in connection with the 
Oct. 6, 1972, escape of Ronald Beaty from the California Institution for Men at 
Chino. 
</P>
<P>
Beaty escaped when a vehicle being used to transport him to a San Bernardino 
court hearing was run off the road. One guard was shot to death and a second 
was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, Beaty, who turned state's witness and helped convict others implicated 
in the plot, said that Landon had smuggled hacksaw blades in to him and had 
ferried out escape plans. Beaty later reversed himself and said variously that 
Landon had nothing to do with the escape or had carried out the plans 
unwittingly. 
</P>
<P>
Landon, who was representing Beaty in a civil rights matter at the time, 
consistently has denied any involvement in the escape. 
</P>
<P>
A 1973 investigation by the San Bernardino County district attorney's office 
ended with no criminal charges filed against Landon. The State Bar of 
California also conducted an inquiry at the time and found insufficient 
evidence for disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
On June 25, 1973, however, prison officials imposed the ban, concluding that 
Landon had smuggled blades into the prison and had carried out an escape plan, 
according to Landon's suit, which was filed July 6 in Marin County. 
</P>
<P>
Both the San Bernardino County district attorney's office and the state bar 
reopened their investigations into the escape in 1988, about the time San Diego 
county supervisors were deciding who should run the local system of indigent 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's investigation closed in October, 1988, and the bar 
association's in May, 1989, both with announcements that the case was closed 
without action against Landon. 
</P>
<P>
Stirling, who had been instrumental in requesting the second bar association 
probe, asked the California Supreme Court to review the closure of the 
association's investigation, according to the suit. He made the request after 
becoming a judge. 
</P>
<P>
Last April 4, the Supreme Court denied Stirling's request without comment, the 
suit said. 
</P>
<P>
Reached Friday at the downtown San Diego County Courthouse, Stirling said he 
could not comment on Landon's suit, citing ethical rules that forbid judges 
from comments on pending cases. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, meanwhile, Landon questioned the ban, only to be told in 1975 
and 1980 that it would stay in effect. After asking formally in 1988 that it be 
lifted, Landon was told in a three-sentence July, 1989, letter that it would 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
That denial prompted Landon's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
According to the suit, prison officials have never shown that Landon presents a 
serious threat to security and can no longer show that he is being investigated 
for the 1972 escape. 
</P>
<P>
The initial decision to impose the ban without affording Landon a hearing 
violated his constitutional right to due process, the suit says. And, to 
continue it interferes with his "fundamental right" to meet with his clients 
and the rights of his clients -- in particular, convicted killer Lucas -- to 
attorney access. 
</P>
<P>
Lucas, a carpet cleaner from Spring Valley, was sentenced to die last August 
for three throat-slash murders, one in 1979 and two in 1984. Landon needs to 
confer with Lucas on his death-penalty appeal, now pending before the state 
Supreme Court, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
Prison officials have until Aug. 6 to reply to Landon's suit. The state 
attorney general's office, which will be handling the case for prison 
authorities, plans to contend that the ban is warranted, Deputy Atty. Gen. Karl 
Mayer said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
An initial hearing has been set for Sept. 14.

JACKSON DRIVE EXTENSION STIRS DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BONNA M. DE LA CRUZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deer, coyote, bobcats and endangered birds roam freely in the 5,700-acre 
Mission Trails Regional Park on the eastern boundary of San Diego. It's a 
pocket of wildlife covered by the rare coastal sage scrub where hikers and bird 
watchers can enjoy the serenity of the pristine mountain park. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have proposed a 2.4-mile extension of Jackson Drive through that 
wilderness parkland, and amateur naturalist Gary Suttle believes that the 
proposed four-lane road could jeopardize what is now considered the nation's 
largest expanse of natural open space within city limits. 
</P>
<P>
"When you walk in there, it's a whole different world. It's as if you're not in 
the sixth-largest city anymore," said Suttle, who lives southwest of the park 
in Allied Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
But many neighbors of the park said they have had enough of the traffic 
congestion on residential streets in the Allied Gardens area from commuters 
racing to find faster ways to busy Mission Gorge Road and Interstate 8 and from 
there north on Interstate 15. Those who favor the road say the extension will 
provide some relief, as well as provide greater access to the interior of the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Madaffer, chairman of the Tierrasanta Community Council, which favors the 
extension, said the road provides a vital north-south link for the city. "Many 
of the concerns from the opposition are from the emotional aspect. They aren't 
looking at a San Diego in the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Councilwoman Judy McCarty, who represents that area, is pushing to 
begin construction on the extension, which cuts through the western part of the 
park, by the end of next year. She said it will relieve traffic congestion and 
provide commuters in that area a direct link to California 52, once it is 
extended eastward to Santee. 
</P>
<P>
"This road will also lead into the interior of the park. It will open up the 
park for everyone, not just for the local residents and Sierra Club," McCarty 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Sierra Club members and some residents living in the communities that wrap 
around the park are concerned over the project's high price tag and the 
environmental damage it may do to the park. 
</P>
<P>
The project is estimated to cost nearly $71 million, including the cost of the 
debt service, said Robert Radlow, chairman of the grass-roots organization 
Citizens Against Jackson Drive Extension. 
</P>
<P>
He said he also doubts that the extension will do much to relieve the area's 
traffic congestion during peak hours. The extension of Jackson Drive, which now 
dead-ends at Mission Gorge Road, would only divert 4,000 cars from Mission 
Gorge Road, which now carries 37,000 to 46,000 cars a day. Radlow said the road 
will also bring pollution and noise to the park. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't have peace and tranquility with all that air and noise pollution. 
Who wants to hike with a four-lane highway above you?" Radlow asked. 
</P>
<P>
McCarty said the extension would carry about 20,000 cars a day, since it will 
be the only northern connection east of Interstate 15. 
</P>
<P>
Radlow and other opponents of the extension point to a 1988 study conducted by 
the San Diego Assn. of Governments when they talk of the extension proposal. 
Sandag said the proposed Jackson Drive extension is by far the least effective 
solution to the traffic problems, said Janet Esser, Radlow's wife and a newly 
elected member to the San Carlos Area Council. The San Carlos council formally 
opposes the project. 
</P>
<P>
McCarty said plans for the extension have been a part of the city's General 
Plan since 1960, and the recent uproar against the project has come as a 
surprise to her. "I've kept the people informed, and they told me they wanted 
this road," she said. A petition drive has already gathered 500 signatures of 
people favoring the extension, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The extension will serve as a northern connection for the Navajo communities, 
which include Grantville, San Carlos, Allied Gardens and Del Cerro, McCarty 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Massey, who sits on the San Carlos council and Navajo Community 
Planners, said the road will be a massive "cut-and-fill" project. "The road 
will not blend in. It has not been designed to curve naturally through the 
valley," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Canyons will be filled in and hilltops whacked off," she said, noting that the 
project will remove 2 million cubic yards of earth and require 1-million cubic 
yards of dirt for fill. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the project is a bridge that would rise 250 feet and span 1,600 
feet over the San Diego River, which cuts through the park. 
</P>
<P>
Allied Gardens resident John Todd said he supports the extension because 
streets in his community, such as Waring Road, Princess View Drive, Twain 
Avenue and Zion Avenue, which were never intended to carry heavy traffic, are 
being used by commuters as access streets to Interstate 8. 
</P>
<P>
"If Jackson Drive is opened up, those people won't use our residential roads 
anymore," Todd said. He said the congested roads have also posed a safety 
problem, especially for area schools. 
</P>
<P>
Todd and other supporters of the extension are also using the park as a 
rallying point, saying the road will open the interior of the park to all 
citizens. A visitor information center and campground will be built near 
Hollins Lake in the northeastern corner of the park, McCarty said, and should 
open within the next year. 
</P>
<P>
Before construction crews can begin to break ground on the road, an 
environmental impact report, which was supposed to be released in December, 
must be certified by the City Council, which must then vote to adopt the route, 
McCarty said. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the road hope the environmental report will block the project, 
noting that the park is a setting for riparian, or stream-side, vegetation, 
such as willows, cottonwood and sycamore. It is also home to birds like the 
endangered least Bell's vireo and the threatened yellow-throat, Suttle said. He 
said the coastal sage scrub contains aromatic shrubs such as the California 
sagebrush and laurel sumac, which turn emerald green after winter rains. 
</P>
<P>
"The land was purchased by the city with bond money for a park, not to put in a 
transportation corridor," said Linda Michael of the San Diego Sierra Club. 
"These plants and animals are treasures that we have. We must protect them." 
</P>
<P>
April Boling is a member of the Navajo Planners and said the group is waiting 
for the environmental report to be released before it announces its position on 
the debate, although she said she would like to see the park preserved. 
</P>
<P>
But, she is wary of the report because it is being conducted by the same group 
that is designing the extension, P&amp;D Technologies. Lou Ann Holmes, 
assistant to McCarty, said it is standard for the "designers to coordinate the 
environmental impact report to make sure the most environmentally sound design 
is used for the road." 
</P>
<P>
The road extension will be funded by a lion's share of a half-cent sales tax 
that voters approved in 1987 for a list of road improvements. 
</P>
<P>
Radlow said the costly extension is unnecessary because, 2 miles east on 
Mission Gorge Road, at Mast Boulevard, construction is under way to join 
California 52 and California 125, serving the same function as the extension. 
McCarty said that project will take 10 years to complete, and commuters need a 
direct access road as soon as possible.

COURT RULES IN FAVOR OF MOTHER FORCED TO MOVE TO KEEP HER SON; 
</P>
<P>
FAMILY LAW: THE DECISION OVERTURNING A VENTURA JUDGE'S ORDER IS HAILED BY THE 
ACLU AS A VICTORY FOR PARENTS WHO WANT TO RELOCATE AWAY FROM THEIR FORMER 
SPOUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
In a decision that legal experts say will have a deep impact on California 
family law, a state appeals court Friday overturned an order by a Ventura judge 
that forced a divorced mother to move herself and her child from San Francisco 
to be near her former husband in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
The 2nd District Court of Appeal vacated a 1988 order from the Ventura County 
Superior Court, which told Pamela Besser that she would lose custody of her 
6-year-old son, Joshua, unless she moved with him to be near the boy's father, 
Michael Fingert. 
</P>
<P>
Court of Appeal Justice Richard W. Abbe wrote that the ruling by Superior Court 
Judge Charles R. McGrath was unconstitutional because it violated Besser's 
right to travel, which is guaranteed by the California and U.S. constitutions. 
</P>
<P>
Abbe ruled that the lower court abused its discretion by deciding that the boy 
should live near his father because Fingert had a better-paying, 
longer-standing job. 
</P>
<P>
Unless Fingert successfully appeals the ruling to the California Supreme Court, 
Besser will be allowed to move herself and Joshua, now 8, back to the San 
Francisco area, said Jon Davidson, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties 
Union who represented Besser. 
</P>
<P>
Fingert has until Aug. 23 to file an appeal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Fingert could not be reached Friday afternoon for comment, but his 
wife, Michelle, said he is declining comment on the case because, "we feel 
strongly about our privacy and the privacy of our 8-year-old boy." 
</P>
<P>
While the 2nd District Court of Appeal is an intermediate appellate court that 
deals primarily with cases in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, its decisions 
have value as legal precedent throughout the state in the absence of any 
overriding ruling by the California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
The ACLU hailed the ruling as a victory for the rights of parents, particularly 
women, who want to move away from their ex-spouses while retaining custody of 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very, very significant case, and I think it's really a momentous 
victory for the rights of parents, and particularly mothers, to control their 
own destiny after divorce," Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
The best interests of the child are the highest concern in any custody case, 
Davidson said, "but that doesn't allow the courts to play God with the lives of 
the parents." 
</P>
<P>
Joan Patsy Ostroy, a prominent Los Angeles family law attorney, predicted that 
the Fingert decision will become ammunition for divorce lawyers, even though 
the case itself is relatively uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
"The courts don't usually make an order: 'Either you move or you lose,' 
although I suppose the courts say, 'Either you stay put in this joint situation 
or you move alone,' " Ostroy said. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court has ruled that "if you're going to say something like that, 
you have to premise it on the best interests of the child," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it is an important decision for cases like this, where somebody is 
caught in this kind of arrangement," said Hugh McIsaac, director of Family 
Court Services for Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it gives the primary caretaker a leg up . . . I think it's a very 
important decision, but it really leaves the greater tragedy, and that's that 
the parents couldn't work together and fashion something that would work for 
this kid." 
</P>
<P>
Maxine Jackson, assistant director of Family Court Services for Los Angeles 
County, said the Fingert decision clarifies a longstanding dilemma in family 
law -- whether a parent's right to move is more important than the best 
interests of the child. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives some guidance to trial judges, and it is an issue that comes up all 
the time, so it kind of reinforces the whole constitutionality of the issue," 
Jackson said. "These cases are very difficult, they affect both the parents and 
their ability to be with a child . . . It's not going to solve that issue -- 
you can't have it both ways . . . But I just see that it gives clarity." 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Family Court Judge Kenneth A. Black said so-called "removal" cases 
in which a custodial parent wants to relocate to a new area are "the most 
difficult issue" that the family law bench faces. 
</P>
<P>
"By way of example, when you have a case where one party wants to move to New 
York . . . and the other party says, 'What about my need to be near the child?' 
-- that is the toughest, most gut-wrenching kind of case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Besser, who is remarried and expecting a child with her second husband, grinned 
as she read a copy of the appeals court decision Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like I won the lottery -- the women's rights lottery. I'm elated, it's 
exactly what I've wanted," she said. "The important thing is . . . that the 
courts can't tell children where to live. 
</P>
<P>
"It also makes me know I wasn't nuts, that what I was fighting for was right," 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Fingert filed for a divorce from Pamela when she was nine months 
pregnant. Joshua was born Feb. 1, 1982. The divorce court later granted full 
custody to his mother and visitation rights to his father, but that order was 
later modified to give 37% custody to Fingert and 63% custody to Besser. 
</P>
<P>
Besser moved from Ventura to San Diego, and then to San Francisco, and Joshua 
shuttled between his parents first by car, then airplane, according to court 
documents. He would spend three weeks with his mother, then one week with his 
father, even attending two different schools. 
</P>
<P>
When the boy's grades and friendships began to suffer, the couple went to 
Superior Court to modify the custody arrangement. Besser was given a choice -- 
either move with Joshua back to Ventura County or give up her child. She moved, 
then filed the appeal through the ACLU earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
The appeals court ruling Friday began: 
</P>
<P>
"Must the mother of a 6-year-old child, who is the primary custodial parent, be 
required to relocate to the area where the father resides to facilitate his 
visitation or lose custody? No." 
</P>
<P>
The ruling concluded: "Pamela cannot be ordered to choose between her right to 
resettle, find new employment, start a new life and retain custody of her child 
. . . There is no justification for the order requiring Pamela to either 
relocate or lose custody."

LIFEGUARD WHO RESCUED 2 SAYS COUNTY BEACH IS UNSAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL WATSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A veteran state lifeguard on Friday said the county is failing its "moral 
obligation" to make a heavily used beach safe for public use. 
</P>
<P>
James P. Harmon, who rescued two people at the beach during his lunch hour 
Wednesday, said the county-run Emma Wood State Beach two miles north of Ventura 
is hazardous because no lifeguards patrol it. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that the county has at least a moral obligation to maintain a minimum 
level of safety services at park and beach properties that they operate," 
Harmon said. "The only way to make areas safe for swimming is to provide 
trained personnel." 
</P>
<P>
But officials from the county, which took over running the beach from the state 
in 1983, said they know of no drownings there and do not believe that the area 
poses dangers. 
</P>
<P>
"If historically it had been a problem, we would have tried to find funding for 
lifeguards," said Andy Oshita, Ventura County parks manager. "Emma Wood never 
was a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Oshita said that in response to Harmon's complaint, county officials will 
walk the beach and a 120-trailer camping area this weekend, asking people if 
they have experienced dangerous riptides or currents. 
</P>
<P>
The criticism that there are too few lifeguards is a perennial complaint in a 
county with 42 miles of coastline. 
</P>
<P>
In June, lifeguards stationed at Marina Cove Beach in Ventura Harbor complained 
that they were weary of risking their lives in last-minute rescue efforts at 
the nearby unpatrolled south jetty beach. 
</P>
<P>
Despite posted signs warning swimmers of hazardous currents, lifeguards make at 
least 100 rescues a year there, sometimes placing their lives at risk because 
the calls for help come so late. Lifeguards maintain that 99% of the problems 
could be prevented if the beach had its own patrols. 
</P>
<P>
But state, city and port officials disagree, saying that offering lifeguard 
services would send a false message that the turbulent waters are safe for 
swimmers. They prefer to rely on signs that read: "Warning: Hazardous Riptides, 
No Lifeguards on Duty." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the lack of lifeguards is an issue up and down the state coastline, 
said Steve Treanor, superintendent of the state Department of Parks and 
Recreation's Channel Coast District, which extends from McGrath State Beach in 
Oxnard to Carpinteria State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"There are beaches throughout the state that don't have lifeguard service," 
Treanor said. "What we say is that people should swim at lifeguarded beaches -- 
that's the choice they have." 
</P>
<P>
Harmon, a Ventura lawyer who is a part-time state lifeguard, said the situation 
at Emma Wood State Beach has bothered him for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
When Harmon, 33, first began lifeguarding in 1974, Emma Wood was run by the 
state and patrolled in the summer by lifeguards. At one point, Harmon said he 
was stationed as a lifeguard on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Sometime about 1983, lifeguards were removed from the beach. Officials are 
unclear whether it was a state or county decision. 
</P>
<P>
Harmon said the dangers of the unpatrolled area struck him again Wednesday when 
he was visiting the beach on his lunch hour and spotted an 8-year-old girl 
caught in a rip current. 
</P>
<P>
He said it quickly became obvious that the girl, while a strong swimmer, was in 
serious trouble. The father of the girl's friend swam out to help her but also 
began experiencing difficulty, Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
"He was huffing and puffing and she was hanging onto his neck," Harmon said. 
"The little girl was pretty panicky." 
</P>
<P>
Harmon changed into his swim trunks, took his fins and lifeguard rescue tube 
from his car and swam to them. He pulled both of them to safety. 
</P>
<P>
"It was purely a stroke of good fortune that I happened to be there at that 
time and was able to prevent a potential double drowning," Harmon said in a 
letter to county officials. "The crowd and conditions yesterday certainly 
warranted having a lifeguard on duty."

NO BUDGET MEANS NO PAYCHECKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY and HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state budget impasse continued to hit home in Ventura County on Friday as 
paychecks were withheld from 110 local Caltrans workers and from about 40 
employees of area legislators. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the rest of the state work force, Caltrans maintenance employees and 
those who work for lawmakers are paid twice a month, so their mid-July checks 
were held up by the stalemate over a new budget. 
</P>
<P>
Democratic and Republican lawmakers remain split over how much to cut programs 
and increase taxes to balance a $50-billion budget even though the legal 
deadline for approval was June 30. Of all state employees, the state 
Constitution allows only elected officials to be paid without a budget. 
</P>
<P>
At the Ventura road maintenance yard on Friday, workers grumbled as their 
payday came and went without a check, Caltrans Regional Manager Bruce Dyar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of employees living from payday to payday, so some of them are 
going to be hurt," Dyar said. "I was just told about a couple getting ready to 
leave on vacation this weekend and had to cancel." 
</P>
<P>
Dyar, whose workers patch roads and tend the plants along rights of way, said 
he had seen no slowdown by employees. "I've heard some unhappy talk, but they 
seem to be going ahead with their work the same as usual," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Along a roadside in Moorpark, where a California Department of Transportation 
crew was routing traffic around an overturned diesel rig Friday afternoon, 
worker Martin Sanchez discussed the Legislature's inability to approve a 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it stinks," he said. Sanchez said he was expecting a $900 check Friday 
morning, but instead was told to go to work in 95-degree heat without his pay. 
"What are you going to tell the mortgage company when they ask for their 
money?" said Sanchez, as he waved traffic past the accident. 
</P>
<P>
Sanchez's co-worker Joe Arnold said lawmakers "are playing political games with 
the people's money." Arnold, a 22-year state worker, said he was unable to make 
his $2,000 monthly house payment this week because he did not receive $1,200 in 
pay as expected. 
</P>
<P>
Dyar and his workers were especially critical of the Legislature adjourning for 
the weekend without resolving its differences on the budget and forwarding a 
spending plan to Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
"If the legislative people went home today . . . that's one of the sorriest 
things they could have done," Dyar said. Most of his workers gross $1,500 to 
$1,700 a month and need to get their checks on time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Employees at state lawmakers' offices in the county seemed to accept the 
impasse in better spirits. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as we receive some type of paycheck by the first of August, there's 
really no need for us to panic," said John Theiss, 29, an aide to Assemblywoman 
Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley). Theiss is single and earns about $28,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, he said, he talked to Wright about the problem on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her not to come home unless she had our paychecks," Theiss said. "She 
said, 'I think you're going to have to wait.' " 
</P>
<P>
Wright, who came home anyway, said the delay is a shame and dared not predict 
when a new budget will be approved. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the leadership," she said, explaining why negotiations did not begin in 
earnest until after July 1. "It's a case of who blinks first, and neither side 
has blinked yet." 
</P>
<P>
But constituents are blinking, said aides in state Sen. Gary K. Hart's Ventura 
office and in Assemblyman Jack O'Connell's Oxnard office. Both offices have 
received calls from many people concerned about the delays and possible cuts in 
programs, the aides said. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly we take this as part of the job," said Jeff Bowling, an O'Connell 
representative. "But it doesn't affect us nearly as much as people cut off from 
Medi-Cal and other types of assistance." 
</P>
<P>
The poor in Ventura County continue to receive most services provided under 
state programs, such as medical assistance and welfare payments. But had it not 
been for county approval of an emergency $2.4-million loan on Tuesday, 8,000 
welfare families would not have received their mid-July checks. 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit locally have been hundreds of low-income workers who care for about 
1,350 disabled and elderly people in their homes. Those workers -- often family 
or friends of the disabled -- have gone without pay for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
County social workers say the workers' calls for assistance are becoming 
increasingly desperate. Shirley Bush, head of the in-home services program, 
said her offices are getting about 150 phone calls a day from the workers. 
</P>
<P>
"The frustrated phone calls are still coming in," Bush said. "We're not able to 
give them a time line. They tell their landlords that the money's coming, but 
they can't say when. And neither can we." 
</P>
<P>
Making the wait worse, Bush said, is the knowledge that when a budget is 
finally adopted, it almost certainly will include some cuts in the in-home 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"We have people," Bush said, "who live worse than some dogs, and nobody seems 
to want to help them. Until it affects you personally, I don't think you 
realize the degree to which these people are hurting."

PANEL SEARCHES FOR WASP RELEASE SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Ventura County Agricultural Commission is looking for potential sites to 
release biological enemies of the ash whitefly, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Agricultural Commissioner Ann McClure said the agency is compiling a 
list of areas in the county that meet the state Department of Food and 
Agriculture's requirements for breeding the predator, a stingless wasp that is 
harmless to humans, but that attacks the whitefly. 
</P>
<P>
Potential sites must have more than one tree present to ensure that the wasps 
can live there year-round, McClure said. Homeowners must agree not to spray the 
tree or cut it down. 
</P>
<P>
State agricultural officials have said they plan to release 250 wasps at each 
of four as yet unidentified sites. Psyche Pascual

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GALANTER ASKS TO PRESERVE 200 ACRES NEAR 
AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter asked that 200 acres be set aside near Los 
Angeles International Airport for a wildlife preserve, saying that at least 10 
endangered species live only there. "The city of Los Angeles and the Department 
of Airports share a unique opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to 
preserve and restore our natural environment even while we create a much-needed 
recreational facility for our urban residents," Galanter said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
City plans call for a golf course on about two-thirds of the 302-acre coastal 
dune area, Galanter said. She called for 200 acres to be set aside for a nature 
preserve to save endangered species that live there. 
</P>
<P>
Among the endangered species are the El Segundo blue butterfly, the El Segundo 
crab spider, Lange's El Segundo weevil, Bob Ford's dunes pyralid moth, the El 
Segundo scythrid moth, the El Segundo dunes spineflower, Dorothy's El Segundo 
weevil and the El Segundo Jerusalem cricket.

<P>
Police arrested four men early Friday on suspicion of burglarizing an Oxnard 
house after neighbors saw flashlights flickering inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
William Beatty, 20, and Eric Hamilton, 21, both of Oxnard, and Jackie Moore, 
21, and Sam Borgens, 20, both of Port Hueneme, were being held Friday at the 
Ventura County Jail in lieu of $10,000 bail each, said Sgt. Bruce Watlington of

they saw flashlights inside the house in the 4000 block of Eastbourne Bay 
shortly after midnight, said Sgt. Bob Elder of the Oxnard Police Department. 
</P>

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SHERIFF'S DEPT. SUED OVER HANDLING OF 
SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The surviving victim and relatives of four people killed by the estranged 
husband of one victim filed a civil rights suit in U.S. District Court on 
Friday, alleging that the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and Sheriff 
Sherman Block failed to guarantee "equal protection under the law" to 
minorities, women and children. 
</P>
<P>
The August, 1989, shootings in East Los Angeles occurred shortly after Maria 
Navarro, who was celebrating her birthday with others at her home, called the 
sheriff's emergency 911 line to say her estranged husband, Raymond, "was on his 
way to the residence to kill her and others present," the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
The sheriff's dispatcher told Navarro to "just call us if he comes over. . . . 
We can't have a unit sit there to wait," according to the suit. But within 15 
minutes, Raymond Navarro allegedly entered the house and killed his wife, her 
two aunts and a family friend. The suit was brought by Bertha Galvan, who was 
struck in the head by a bullet, Maria Navarro's three children and other 
plaintiffs.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ACCIDENT REVIVES DEBATE OVER STREET'S 
SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The death of a motorcyclist last month on a residential street in Studio City 
has intensified a decade-old debate over ways to control the traffic that jams 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
The fatal crash June 3 on Laurel Terrace Drive, a narrow street running 
diagonally south of the intersection of Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards, 
was similar to a collision at the same spot in 1984 and another fatal accident 
on the street in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city installed stop signs at the site of the two most recent 
crashes and restricted access to the area during the morning commute, some 
residents say tougher action is needed. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Rinella, a member of the Studio City Residents' Assn., wants the city to 
block his neighborhood off from outside traffic. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say Rinella's plan would increase traffic on Ventura and Laurel 
Canyon boulevards, both of which now are operating at what the city considers 
to be capacity.

PALMDALE SCRAPS THEATER BECAUSE OF RISING COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Troubled by rising project costs and an expected slump in the economy, Palmdale 
officials have scrapped plans to build a 700-seat theater and now hope to 
refurbish a 40-year-old school auditorium for half the price. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council voted 3 to 2 to back away from the theater project Thursday 
night after learning that the estimated cost of the proposed 25,000-square-foot 
theater center had increased from $4.7 million to $8 million in the past eight 
months. 
</P>
<P>
That news, combined with projections of a slowdown in the city's economic 
growth, led the council to instead budget $4 million to transform the 
boarded-up Maryott Auditorium into a modest, 400-seat, 12,000-square-foot 
venue. 
</P>
<P>
Council members acknowledged that they were no longer aiming for a lofty, city 
gateway-type project that might attract big-time theater groups headed for Los 
Angeles. Instead, they said, they will settle for a small arena to serve the 
city's own theater groups. 
</P>
<P>
The immediate effect of the council's change in direction, the latest chapter 
in the city's turbulent six-year quest for a theater, is more delays. City 
officials had spent years working on plans for a more elaborate renovation of 
the old building. But last December, a previous City Council halted that in 
favor of building the new theater. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's council decision infuriated city theater activists. The city budget 
already included extra money for the new theater center. Yet many residents 
applauded the council's change of heart, saying the extra money could be better 
spent on a new library or more parks. 
</P>
<P>
"The Maryott isn't my idea of what we want to have. But I think it will suffice 
in the short run," said Councilwoman Janis Hamm, a past supporter of the new 
theater center. She and newly elected council members James Ledford and James 
Root provided the key votes for the council's reversal. 
</P>
<P>
City officials blamed the rapid escalation in the theater center's cost on 
several factors, including nearly a year of inflation from the prior estimate 
and changes in the project. They said the earlier estimate failed to account 
for the cost of items other than the building itself, such as a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The three council members questioned the city's ability to afford such a costly 
project and warned that it could drain other city programs. Ledford and Root 
questioned Palmdale's need for a new 700-seat theater when the neighboring city 
of Lancaster is building a similar project. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't reconcile in my mind the need for two 700-seat theaters," Root said. 
The cost of the 725-seat theater in Lancaster, about 10 miles away, has 
generated debate. Palmdale officials argue that it will cost up to $13 million, 
although Lancaster officials are saying it will cost from $10 million to $12 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale's now-abandoned theater center project stood to cost less because Los 
Angeles developer Ron Ordin had agreed to donate the land, a 5.7-acre parcel 
along the Antelope Valley Freeway, if the city built a theater there. In 
contrast, the old auditorium is located in an older area near downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"This has been sabotaged at the city level. I am demanding answers as to why," 
said an angry David Milligan, executive director of the Antelope Valley 
Cultural Foundation, after the council's vote. Since 1984, the foundation has 
been the prime supporter of the theater plan. 
</P>
<P>
Milligan said the city's scaled-down plan to renovate the Maryott Auditorium 
will not be adequate for Palmdale's two theater groups. And by the time the 
city complies with fire, seismic, handicapped access and other codes, he 
predicted that the project will cost almost as much as a new theater. 
</P>
<P>
Other residents, though, backed the council's decision. Some argued that the 
plan to build a new theater would have saddled the city with hundreds of 
thousands of dollars a year in operating costs. Others said the costly project 
would only have benefited a few theater devotees.

URBAN CAMPERS STAKE A CLAIM 
</P>

When Willie Jordan started a day camp for poor children, she did not settle for 
the obvious. 
</P>
<P>
Facing the expected worries about costs and logistics, the director of the Fred 
Jordan Mission came up with a campsite that met her needs. She chose one of the 
city's most trash-laden, crime-ridden, drug-infested areas -- MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
"It's turned into such a dangerous park," said Jordan, 56, wife of the late 
founder of the mission, as her Kid Row Day Camp opened its third season this 
week. "Because it is not safe, that's exactly why we wanted to go there." 
</P>
<P>
Determined not to be intimidated by the crime and squalor that have overtaken 
the 32-acre urban park, Jordan and her campers return to the site each year to 
fulfill the day camp's pledge to "take back the parks for the children." 
</P>
<P>
"It's great that we are going there," she said. "The parks should be used by 
kids without them having to fear for their lives. We go right to where the kids 
live, and make it safe for a couple of hours." 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, volunteers from the mission distributed flyers around the park, 
inviting children living nearby to attend the camp, which runs until July 27. 
Each day at about 3:30 p.m., after year-round classes let out, children from a 
20-block area around the park gather for the camp near the corner of Park View 
and 6th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Other children are bused to the park from hotels on Skid Row, where the mission 
is located. 
</P>
<P>
Still others, like Teresa Chavez's six children -- who attended the camp during 
previous summers but have since moved away from their Westlake neighborhood 
near the park -- are driven in from more distant areas. The Chavez family now 
lives on 84th Street in South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I worried at first, because the park is kind of scary," Chavez, 32, 
said in Spanish. "But now, I know the children are all right. The people from 
the mission take care." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of heading for the mountains or some other bucolic setting, these 
campers remain in the city, joining in sing-alongs, party games and a show 
called, "Bible Boot Camp," run by a pastor wearing military-style camouflage 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
One 11-year-old girl sat among the campers holding a Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles coloring kit -- her prize for winning a camp game. The girl, who lives 
in a Skid Row hotel, said she was going to take the prize home. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to share it with my brother," she said. "He's always saying he 
doesn't ever get anything." 
</P>
<P>
The campers have been sharing the park with police, horse and foot patrols. The 
stepped-up LAPD patrols in recent weeks are aimed at ridding MacArthur Park of 
drug dealers and unlicensed vendors. The crackdown, which began last month, is 
part of an effort to ferret out the ragged, violence-prone crowds that had 
taken over the park, contributing to a 43% increase in arrests in the area over 
the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"If we went to the nice neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley or Orange 
County, it wouldn't be a big deal," Jordan said. Such a program in the affluent 
suburbs, she said, would make "no difference for the children there. They can 
use their parks." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone appreciates the mission's efforts. Jordan recalled a disturbing 
conversation during a radio talk show appearance three summers ago. 
</P>
<P>
"The caller was very abrasive, very confrontational," she said. " 'How dare you 
take these poor little children and try to show them how the rest of the world 
lives. Don't you know they will be so dissatisfied?' the man scolded. It was 
one of the most bizarre conversations I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
The camp program includes weekly field trips. Outings to the Queen Mary and the 
Spruce Goose, Universal Studios and the Ringling Brothers &amp; Barnum and 
Bailey Circus are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I want the children to be dissatisfied with poverty conditions," 
Jordan said. "This program gives these kids a chance to see things that other 
kids take for granted. It gives them the little extras. It's like saying, 'Hey, 
there is more. You can be more.' "

PORTER RANCH PLAN SPECIFICATIONS WILL DELAY THE BULLDOZERS; 
</P>
<P>
TIMETABLES: A NUMBER OF UNRESOLVED ISSUES WILL PROBABLY DELAY THE GRADING OF 
CHATSWORTH HILLSIDES FOR ANOTHER YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Although the City Council has approved the massive Porter Ranch development 
project, it will be another year before the tracks of bulldozers grind up the 
last footprints of hikers over 1,300 acres of the Chatsworth hills. 
</P>
<P>
The city and the Porter Ranch Development Co. must settle several issues before 
the foundation for the first house or shopping center can be laid in the area 
north of the Simi Valley Freeway. The only part of the project on which 
construction may start sooner is on a fire station and support roads for it at 
the southern end of the site. 
</P>
<P>
But make no mistake, the scrub-covered hills are about to change forever. And 
not just the brush will disappear under a bulldozer's tracks. In some cases, so 
will the hills. 
</P>
<P>
Although the developer has promised not to alter the area's hilly topography, 
the hills that remain after the project is completed in 20 years will not even 
be the same hills that are there now, according to a city official. 
</P>
<P>
The developer will use a new process known as "land-form grading," a spokesman 
said, in which "you just kind of reshape things to make it so a street can fit 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Bolger, 62, a hiker from Woodland Hills, treks through the area as many as 
four times a week. He said he will continue to do so once construction on the 
project begins, but it won't be the same. 
</P>
<P>
"It will sort of spoil the area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite vocal protests by area homeowners during the permit process, the City 
Council voted 14 to 0 Tuesday to allow development to proceed after the area's 
councilman, Hal Bernson, announced his support. 
</P>
<P>
By approving the company's basic land-use plan, the City Council cleared the 
way to transform undeveloped hills north of the Simi Valley Freeway in 
Chatsworth into a vast complex that would provide housing for up to 11,000 
people and jobs for up to 21,000. 
</P>
<P>
The land-use plan approved by the council stipulates only the type of 
development -- residential, commercial or recreational -- that may occur in 
various parts of the project area. It does not specify which parts of the 
project would be developed first or where individual structures would be built. 
</P>
<P>
The developer must receive city approval of more detailed construction maps 
before construction can begin. City officials said that process is likely to 
take at least 18 months and could take up to six years. 
</P>
<P>
To build the fire station and supporting roads, a requirement of the Los 
Angeles City Fire Department, the developer will extend Winnetka Avenue north 
of the Simi Valley Freeway, Corbin Avenue north across the freeway and west to 
the new segment of Winnetka Avenue, and Rinaldi Street west to Corbin Avenue, 
said Porter Ranch Development Co. spokes 
</P>
<P>
man Paul Clarke. The new fire station will be at Winnetka and Corbin avenues, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Building on the commercial and residential portions of Porter Ranch cannot 
begin until the city approves more detailed plans for the 24 sections, or 
tracts, into which the developer has divided the 1,300 acres, said Nancy 
Scrivner, an associate with the city Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
The developer determines the order in which it presents the tracts, and may 
submit the tract maps individually or in groups. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke indicated that after the developer builds the fire station and 
supporting roads, it will extend Mason Avenue north and Rinaldi Street west 
until the two roads meet. At that intersection, he said, a neighborhood mall 
will be built containing a grocery store, a pharmacy and a dry-cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
When the developer builds the shopping mall, he said, it will "probably put 
some houses in as well." Construction will proceed throughout the entire 20 
years of planned development on a tract-by-tract basis, Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the developer may submit the tract maps in any order, the city must 
approve each map before construction can begin. The city normally takes between 
six and eight months to rule on a tract plan, said Ron Maben, a city planner. 
The city's response, Maben said, usually is a "yes with conditions" -- a 
tentative approval that requires the developer to take certain additional 
actions before starting to build. 
</P>
<P>
Typical requirements include larger sewage systems and wider roads, Scrivner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After the city approves the tract plan, the developer has six years to meet the 
conditions required by the city. But most developers fulfill their obligations 
within months, Maben said. So the average time between submitting a tract map 
and starting construction ranges from 18 months to two years. 
</P>
<P>
Porter Ranch Development Co. has not decided which tracts it will seek to 
develop after it finishes the fire station and the area around the residential 
mall, Clarke said. The company will attempt to sell houses before they are 
built, he said, so it will consider buyers' demands in deciding which tracts to 
submit for city approval first. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the size of the proposed Porter Ranch project, the city and the 
developer will attempt to negotiate an extra accord, called a development 
agreement, before the developer submits the first tract map for city approval. 
Under a typical development agreement, city officials said, the city might 
allow the developer to build more residential units than normally allowed in 
exchange for a promise to include other items, such as affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke said lawyers from the city and his company will begin to negotiate a 
development agreement this week. Although he said he hopes an accord will be 
signed, he said his company could decide to submit a tract map for city 
approval before a development agreement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
The optional development agreement, Scrivner said, simply "reduces problems 
down the road." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke said that even when all the agreements have been signed and all the 
tracts have been developed, the land on Porter Ranch will resemble its current 
topographic form. "There's nothing that in any way, shape or form will be in 
any way what you refer to as massive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Scrivner disagreed. The land in general will remain as hilly as before, she 
said, but "the topography won't be the same." She said Porter Ranch after 
development will have "a sort of natural-looking landscape, but it won't look 
like it is now." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 1,300 acres the City Council approved, the developer has 
large property holdings next to that parcel. The company already has received 
conditional city approval for development of two tracts northeast of the 
1,300-acre project, city civil engineer Glenn Hirano said.

DAY-CARE OPERATOR FACES 4 YEARS; 
</P>
<P>
RESEDA: FIVE FELONY COUNTS OF CHILD ENDANGERMENT ARE FILED. POLICE SAY THEY 
FOUND A MARIJUANA PLANT AND A LOADED RIFLE IN HER HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The district attorney's office on Friday filed felony child endangerment 
charges against the operator of a Reseda day-care center where police found an 
eight-foot-high marijuana plant and a loaded gun within reach of children. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Elaine McIntyre, 28, who operated the day-care center in her home in the 
19500 block of Vanowen Street, was charged with five counts of child 
endangerment -- one for each of the children she was caring for at the time of 
her arrest. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre was also charged with one felony count of cultivating marijuana, said 
James A. Baker, chief filing deputy in the district attorney's Van Nuys office. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre, who is free on $5,000 bail, is scheduled to be arraigned on Aug. 1, 
Baker said. If convicted, the woman would face a maximum sentence of four 
years, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre was arrested Tuesday after Los Angeles police received an anonymous 
tip that marijuana was being grown at the house. Detectives saw an 
eight-foot-tall marijuana plant extending over a back-yard fence next to 
children's toys and obtained a search warrant, police said. 
</P>
<P>
McIntyre told police that she was growing the marijuana to help cut down on her 
live-in boyfriend's drug expenses, Baker said. Police quoted McIntyre as saying 
she put the marijuana in brownies and cookies. 
</P>
<P>
The boyfriend, Michael Cardenas, 30, was not at home when police searched the 
house Tuesday, but he was arrested Wednesday night on suspicion of cultivating 
marijuana. He has not yet been charged, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the marijuana plant, police found about five ounces of the drug 
inside the house and a loaded rifle in an unlocked bedroom, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Child endangerment charges were not filed in connection with two other children 
who were present in the home with their mother and in connection with 
McIntyre's 7-year-old daughter, who has been placed in the care of a friend of 
McIntyre's, Baker said. Charges on behalf of those children would have been 
misdemeanors and would have added little to the case, according to a 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Social Services, which licenses day-care centers, 
revoked McIntyre's permission to operate the day-care center after police 
complained. McIntyre can request an administrative hearing to appeal the 
license suspension.

3RD FATAL CRASH RENEWS CALL FOR BLOCKING SHORT CUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY BALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The death of a motorcyclist last month on a residential street in Studio City 
has intensified a decade-old debate over ways to control the traffic that jams 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
The fatal crash June 3 on Laurel Terrace Drive, a narrow street running 
diagonally south of the intersection of Ventura and Laurel Canyon boulevards in 
Studio City, was similar to a collision at the same spot in 1984 and another 
fatal accident on the street in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city installed stop signs at Laurel Terrace Drive and Laurel Grove 
Avenue -- the site of the two most recent crashes -- and restricted access to 
Laurel Terrace Drive during the morning commute, some residents of the street 
say tougher action is needed. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Rinella, a member of the Studio City Residents' Assn., wants the city to 
block his neighborhood off from outside traffic. He has asked the city to 
install water-filled barrels at three intersections on Laurel Terrace Drive and 
nearby streets to discourage commuters bound from the Westside to the west San 
Fernando Valley from using Laurel Terrace as a shortcut. 
</P>
<P>
The barrels would be inexpensive, could easily be removed, and would make "this 
area a mouse maze," he said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say Rinella's plan, first advocated in 1988 and raised 
periodically since then, simply would increase traffic on Ventura and Laurel 
Canyon boulevards, both of which now are operating at what the city considers 
to be capacity. 
</P>
<P>
A city Transportation Department traffic survey of Laurel Terrace Drive 
conducted this year found that 6,000 vehicles use the street daily, said Jim 
Sherman, principal transportation engineer for the Los Angeles Department of 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
The average Valley residential street carries between 4,000 and 5,000 vehicles 
each day, but some streets in Valley residential areas are used by as many as 
14,000 cars, Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident rate on Laurel Terrace Drive is not "significantly different than 
any other streets," Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, homeowners say they see too many speeding cars on their street. Glen 
Rocklin, who has lived on Laurel Terrace Drive since 1984, wants the city to 
prevent non-resident drivers from entering the street during the morning and 
evening rushes. "You do whatever's necessary to keep cars moving on the main 
arteries that were designed to deal with the traffic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The installation of stop signs at Laurel Terrace and Laurel Grove after the 
June 3 crash reduced the speed and volume of traffic, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
Diana Brueggemann, an aide to Councilman Michael Woo, said further relief will 
come to homeowners on the street when two additional left-turn lanes are built 
for the use of northbound Laurel Canyon Boulevard traffic turning onto 
westbound Ventura Boulevard. That would unknot tie-ups at that intersection and 
reduce the need to use Laurel Terrace as a shortcut. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and officials also say they hope a periodic traffic survey now under 
way will persuade the city to reduce the speed limit on the road from 30 m.p.h. 
to 25 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Laurel Terrace Drive remains a favorite shortcut of commuters in the 
Valley. "It's almost a joke," Los Angeles Police Officer Dale Turner said of 
the ease with which he catches speeders on the street. "There's no challenge 
here at all."

2 YOUTHS ACCUSED OF ENDANGERING BOY, 4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two El Cajon youths were arrested Friday night on suspicion of driving 40 
m.p.h. while one stood on the car's rear bumper and held a 4-year-old boy in 
his arms. 
</P>
<P>
The child was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
Steve J. Shaffer, 19, was held on suspicion of child endangerment, reckless 
driving and driving without a license, police said. Alvin G. Snowden III, 19, 
who police said was holding the child, was held on suspicion of child 
endangerment. Both were booked into County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the two youths were baby-sitting the boy and were returning him to 
his mother, Melanie Sullivan, who was visiting at their home on Van Houten 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Police stopped the car at 5:20 p.m. in the 500 block of Van Houten, a 
residential street, as it was traveling 40 m.p.h. in a 25-m.p.h. zone, police 
spokeswoman Sheri Naumann said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Snowden was standing on the car's bumper, holding on to the car 
with one hand and clutching the child under the other arm. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't give any reason for doing it," Naumann said. "Thank God, the child 
wasn't hurt." 
</P>
<P>
The boy's first name was not available. He lives with his mother east of El 
Cajon, Naumann said.

GERMAN BASHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Was what Nicholas Ridley said about a united Germany in a recent magazine 
interview really all that terrible? 
</P>
<P>
In his own oddball fashion, Britain's minister for trade and industry was just 
agreeing with many analysts that in the new order of things that will follow 
the formal creation of the European Community in 1992, Germany will be the 
dominant force. 
</P>
<P>
Its currency already is the strongest in Europe. And many Europeans have 
deep-seated fears about a unified Germany. No new ground broken here. 
</P>
<P>
But Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's cabinet minister could have gotten the 
idea across without likening the European Community to Adolf Hitler and 
wondering whether London might be better served if the Germans started bombing 
it again instead of trying to take over its economy. 
</P>
<P>
Ridley has "unreservedly" withdrawn the remarks, with about the same effect as 
trying to withdraw an artillery shell after the lanyard is pulled. And because 
Thatcher's own government is divided on European unification, he may keep his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
But before she lets that happen, she needs to worry a little about Ridley's 
runaway rhetoric. True, nothing Ridley said will make the new Germany less 
dominant, and nothing he can say now will make the new Germans less furious. 
Nothing anybody says will allow Britain to ignore the new Germany and go on 
about its business. But somehow Ridley made it all a little worse; perhaps now 
the British PM needs to make it a little better.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HEARING POSTPONED ON LANDFILL EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Planning Commission has postponed a public hearing set for 
Tuesday on plans to expand the Lopez Canyon Landfill in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing has been rescheduled for 9 a.m. Aug. 21 at the Airtel Plaza Hotel 
in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
The hearing was postponed because the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District is conducting hearings into alleged violations of state air pollution 
laws at the landfill. Neighbors in the Kagel Canyon and Lake View Terrace areas 
have asked the AQMD hearing board to close the dump. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation wants to almost double the capacity of the 
city's only dump to 26 million tons, extending the landfill's life through the 
year 2005. 
</P>
<P>
Without the expansion, the landfill must close in 1992, and the city would have 
to find another place to dump 4,000 tons of household trash collected each day. 
The dump opened in 1974.

DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN, 29, CHARGED IN DEATHS OF 2 WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man was charged Friday with murdering his ex-girlfriend and her sister and 
attempting to murder another man during a shooting rampage Wednesday in 
Sepulveda. 
</P>
<P>
Dean Roger McGrath, 29, could face the death penalty because the early morning 
attack involved multiple victims, one of several special circumstances that 
warrant a death sentence, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
His arraignment on two charges of first-degree murder and on one charge of 
attempted murder, scheduled for Friday, was delayed to July 20 in San Fernando 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath was arrested about 2:30 p.m. Wednesday in a North Hollywood house where 
he was known to have stayed, Detective Michael Brandt said. About 12 hours 
earlier, McGrath allegedly fired a shotgun at sisters Marleene Evelyn Taylor, 
32, and Kathleen Taylor Fien, 30, inside the small, two-bedroom house where 
they lived with Taylor's two sons. The boys, ages 2 and 4, were not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath also allegedly shot Anthony Deluca, 28, as he ran from the house 
calling for help. Deluca is recovering at an undisclosed hospital in the Valley 
and is expected to testify against McGrath at a preliminary hearing, Brandt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Police had not determined the relationships between McGrath and the victims, 
but said the motive stemmed from a domestic dispute.

TAXI DRIVER SHOT IN BACK NEAR SDSU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man reportedly shot a taxi driver near San Diego State University and stole 
his cab Friday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The Yellow Cab Co. driver was in serious condition at UC San Diego Medical 
Center, a hospital nursing supervisor said. 
</P>
<P>
William Joseph Tufford, 47, of San Diego, was shot once in the back with a 
.22-caliber handgun, police spokesman Bill Robinson said. The bullet passed 
through or near Tufford's lung, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Tufford apparently picked up the assailant as a passenger in Pacific Beach. The 
shooting occurred about 2:25 p.m. in the 5100 block of Yerba Santa Drive near 
Montezuma Road, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
An elderly couple reportedly saw Tufford and the attacker fighting on the 
ground. Another witness reported hearing two shots. The thief fled the scene in 
the cab, carrying the gun, Robinson said.. 
</P>
<P>
Police do not know if the man robbed Tufford, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
The thief was described as white, in his early 30s, with long blond hair. 
</P>
<P>
The stolen Yellow Cab, a 1987 Chevrolet Celebrity, is No. 861. 
</P>
<P>
Police ask anyone with information about the case to call 235-TIPS. A $1,000 
reward is available for information leading to an arrest in the case.

<P>
Police are looking for vandals who damaged the windows of at least 26 vehicles 
parked on streets in Ocean Beach and Loma Portal. 
</P>
<P>
"It just looks like someone hanging out the window and shooting cars as they go 
by," police detective Jim Yeatts said. 
</P>
<P>
The vandals apparently used a pellet gun, a BB gun or a slingshot, police 
spokesman Bill Robinson said. The windows were cracked but not smashed through. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they believed the shootings occurred sometime between 10 p.m. 
Tuesday and 8 a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Seven of the cars were parked along Palermo Drive in Ocean Beach; the others 
were parked throughout Ocean Beach and Loma Portal, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are probably twice those (number of) cars that didn't report the 
vandalism," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police ask that anyone with information call the department at 236-6093.

MEANING OF 'DON'T WALK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Kerry Lotts' complaint that students are getting jaywalking tickets 
for crossing the street against "don't walk" signs. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't walk" doesn't mean "walk." It's a red light. 
</P>
<P>
Whenever I touch my scalp, I feel a large numb area from where I fell and the 
nerves of my forehead were severed when my glasses cut my eyebrow open. How did 
this happen? I was struck by a car while jaywalking at Sherman Way near Topanga 
on Nov. 4, 1986, at 7:14 p.m. I had a $700 hospital bill from the emergency 
ward plus much therapy. Not only is jaywalking against the law, it's dangerous. 
The police are there "to protect and to serve."

FIRE CREATES MONUMENTAL TRAFFIC JAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR and JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By forcing the closure of a three-mile downtown section of the Hollywood 
Freeway, a fire in a Metro Rail tunnel early Friday created one of the region's 
worst traffic jams ever -- trapping thousands of morning commuters for hours on 
the San Bernardino, Pomona, Foothill and Santa Ana freeways. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol officers closed all north and southbound lanes of 
U.S. 101 between the Harbor and San Bernardino freeways at 2:30 a.m., severing 
a vital artery in a highway system that carries more than 1.4 million people 
through the center of Los Angeles each day. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot remember a time when the Hollywood Freeway has been closed down in 
both directions," said Lydia Martinez, a CHP spokeswoman. "That is the major 
artery downtown." 
</P>
<P>
It was not known when the stretch of freeway would be reopened. Caltrans 
officials said a meeting will be held Sunday to weigh the damage and consider 
the options. The freeway will be closed through the weekend and possibly into 
next week, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
While the freeway remained closed throughout the day, emergency measures 
employed by various government agencies and downtown employers succeeded in 
avoiding outbound gridlock Friday afternoon. Officials from Caltrans, the CHP 
and the city's Transportation Department had urged downtown businesses to allow 
employees to leave for home as early as 2 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a late-afternoon truck accident closed all four northbound 
lanes of the San Diego Freeway in the San Fernando Valley. The accident, which 
involved a load of asbestos-laden sawdust, blocked another key section of the 
freeway system for several hours during the evening commute. 
</P>
<P>
During the morning rush hours, commuters traveling from the eastern San Gabriel 
Valley to downtown reported that their drive time was twice as long as normal. 
One city employee spent 2 1/2 hours driving to City Hall from her West Covina 
home, normally a 50-minute commute. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw people throwing up their hands, turning around and going home," said 
Donna Schwarz, 42, an analyst in the city Department of Aging who found herself 
stuck on the Pomona Freeway. "The phrase 'You can't get there from here' was 
invented for today." 
</P>
<P>
Schwarz eventually decided to get off the clogged highway and onto Atlantic 
Boulevard in East Los Angeles. Zigzagging on surface streets, she arrived at 
work 45 minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
"Our boss wasn't holding it against us," she said. "Everyone from the Eastside 
was late." 
</P>
<P>
As firefighters battled the early morning blaze in a Metro Rail tunnel 
underneath the Hollywood Freeway downtown, the men and women who monitor the 
ebb and flow of traffic through the nation's most traveled urban-freeway system 
struggled through the morning to avert gridlock. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after 2:30 a.m., Caltrans workers placed movable signs on the 
Hollywood, Santa Ana and other freeways, notifying commuters of the downtown 
freeway closure and directing them to alternate routes. Later, Caltrans posted 
signs advising drivers to tune in to special AM radio broadcasts with traffic 
reports made from portable transmitters. 
</P>
<P>
By 8 a.m., commuters were avoiding the crippled Hollywood Freeway, only to jam 
other major arteries, including the far-away Foothill and San Diego freeways. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, it has affected everything in the system at one point or another," 
CHP Officer Martinez said as the morning commute began to wind down about 9 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Freakishly, gridlock on some inbound freeways meant easy going on some downtown 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
"The (inner) part of downtown seems to be actually lighter," said Brian 
Gallagher, an engineer with the city Transportation Department. "Getting into 
downtown is the difficult part. Once you get past the freeways, it's pretty 
clear." 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher directed efforts at the Transportation Department's control center to 
keep traffic flowing on those surface streets that became alternate routes for 
freeway motorists. 
</P>
<P>
By manipulating traffic signals, Gallagher said, transportation officials were 
able to keep the traffic flowing at a relatively smooth pace. 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Department also deployed traffic officers at surface streets 
crowded by those who had given up on the freeways. One officer, Bob Johnson, 
was called in early, around 2 a.m., to begin redirecting traffic. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people come up wondering where they can get on the freeway," Johnson 
said. "I have to tell them the alternate routes. People will ask why they can't 
come through. I guess they don't listen to the radio." 
</P>
<P>
Others motorists, however, seemed well informed of the freeway closure, and 
many opted to avoid the unpleasant commute altogether. 
</P>
<P>
At one Broadway law office, 30-year-old secretary Laura Escalante sat alone. 
Two attorneys in her office had chosen to stay in the San Fernando Valley 
rather than negotiate the Hollywood Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
"The other secretary, her car stalled. So she's not here either," Escalante 
said, adding that her 20-minute commute from Monterey Park had been a 75-minute 
ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, with the Hollywood Freeway remaining closed, officials turned 
their attention to the homebound commute, which peaks between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. 
On most afternoons, about 40,000 cars carrying 100,000 commuters leave downtown 
each hour. 
</P>
<P>
Several downtown businesses complied with an LAPD request to send workers home 
early. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,200 employees at the downtown corporate headquarters of Unocal were told 
shortly after the lunch hour that they were "free to go home after 3:30 p.m." 
if their commute was affected by the freeway closure, said Barry Lane, 
spokesman for Unocal. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate's 4,500 downtown employees also were encouraged by supervisors 
to finish work early, said Simon Barkerbenfield, senior vice president of 
corporate public relations. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Caltrans workers set up detour signs on downtown streets directing 
motorists away from closed freeway on-ramps. 
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon rush, the measures appeared to work. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is surprisingly light," said CHP Officer Dan Bower. "This morning 
was a lot worse. We were expecting it to be lighter because everyone left 
early. 
</P>
<P>
"The only problems we're having are on the surface streets," he said. "Once 
they get on the freeways, it's all open. Isn't that funny? It's usually the 
other way around." 
</P>
<P>
Experienced commuters took circuitous routes home, hoping to avoid the most 
congested freeways. Maria Lans, a 42-year-old a legal assistant, explained how 
she planned to get home to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"I can always take Figueroa (Street) and pass across the 110 (Freeway) without 
getting on the freeway downtown," Lans said as she filled her car with gas at a 
downtown service station. "Then I could skirt along Dodger Stadium and pick up 
the 110 at the overpass right near the entrance to Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"And then I just hope for the best." 
</P>
<P>
Some downtown workers downplayed the traffic problems. Greg Nelson, an 
assistant to Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs, was one of many commuters 
who "zoomed right in" to work in the morning. And he expected few problems on 
the long drive back home to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at these things as a challenge," he said. "It's like a maze. You get 
off one route and you try another. It's a challenge. Life is not always 
perfect. Things like this add a little variety." 
</P>
<P>
Also contributing to the tunnel fire coverage were Times staff writers Paul 
Feldman, Paul Lieberman, Victor Merina, Dean Murphy, Ron Smith, Ronald B. 
Taylor, Tracy Wilkinson and Tracy Wood.

4,000 HAPPY ALBANIANS REACH REFUGE IN THE WEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BRINDISI, Italy 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The repressive curtain around Europe's most backward society was flicked aside 
revealingly Friday for the first time in 45 years as about 4,000 grimy but 
exuberant Albanians streamed ashore here to new lives in Western refuge. 
</P>
<P>
The refugees emerged almost trance-like from an internationally sponsored 
boatlift that transported them from a homeland wrapped in stubborn Stalinist 
isolation since the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"We worked, the Communist leaders ate. I will go home again when Albania is 
free," said unshaven factory worker Rudolph Hadahami, fingering the unfamiliar 
plastic wrappings around a piece of cake. 
</P>
<P>
As they came ashore in bright sunshine, the Albanians looked as though they had 
stepped through a time warp. 
</P>
<P>
The women wore plastic shoes and homemade dresses of cheap, shiny fabric in 
styles long forgotten in Western Europe. Nearly all the men wore shapeless 
sandals and flared trousers of 1970s inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
"They were very frightened at first. You could feel their fear. Was it really 
over? Or just a trick?" said Claudio Luksich, chief engineer on Espresso 
Grecia, one of the four ships sent to Albania to bring the refugees here. 
</P>
<P>
The four ferries chartered by Italy and West Germany brought 3,915 Albanians to 
Brindisi after a four-hour, 85-mile passage of the Adriatic from the Albanian 
port of Durres. A fifth ship, under French charter, was bound for Marseilles 
early today carrying another 550 refugees. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the arrivals were rough-cut, single young men, but the first Albanian 
ashore here Friday, wrapped firmly in the arms of an Italian Red Cross nurse 
sprinting for a waiting ambulance, was a three-day-old baby born at the West 
German Embassy in Tirana. 
</P>
<P>
In all, about 3,100 refugees had taken shelter at the German legation in the 
Albanian capital. Within two hours of landing in Brindisi, they were 
northward-bound aboard three 20-car trains staffed by the West German Red Cross 
and unarmed Bavarian border police. 
</P>
<P>
About 850 Albanians who had jammed the Italian Embassy in Tirana went by bus 
from the port to clean beds, hot showers and restorative pasta at a disused 
Italian army depot outside this port, about 335 miles southeast of Rome. 
</P>
<P>
The Albanians came to Italy tired and travel-stained. Many were barefoot; some 
had no shirts. Clothes slept in for a week or more had not aged well. Everybody 
needed a bath. 
</P>
<P>
As refugees, they were archetypal: Literally all they had was what they were 
wearing when they voted with their feet against an Albanian regime that is the 
last hard-line Communist government in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning June 28, the Albanians -- alone on the spur of the moment, with 
friends, with entire conspiring families -- had stormed Western embassies in 
the capital seeking asylum from the repression and poverty of a country where 
yearly per-capita income is less than $1,000 and the list of political crimes 
is long. 
</P>
<P>
"I love my country. It is terrible to leave, but for me this is a political 
emigration. I want to study, I must be free," said a 25-year-old named Vilma 
from Tirana whose carriage and hazel eyes brought photographers swarming. 
</P>
<P>
"Albanians are still afraid of the police, but communism is finished. People 
are rising up," said Gregor Posto, 34, bound for Germany with his wife and 
three small children. 
</P>
<P>
The boatlift was the fruit of long negotiations between Western governments, 
the United Nations and the shaky, timidly reforming regime of Albanian 
strongman Ramiz Alia. 
</P>
<P>
While diplomats palavered, refugees said, conditions at the overcrowded 
embassies went from bad to worse. Food was short, water precious. 
</P>
<P>
"There was water only four or five hours a day. The government shut it off; it 
was medieval, like living in a castle, surrounded," said Nuri Kercani, 27, an 
economist and one of a minority of intellectuals among the refugees proud of 
their learned-at-home Italian, English or French. 
</P>
<P>
"The government sent spies into the embassies, saying we'd be driven out. We 
hid from them, afraid that if we were identified, they would take reprisals 
against our families," said a 20-year-old youth named Gentian who asked not to 
be identified further. 
</P>
<P>
Like many of the refugees, Gentian, whose complaints about Albania are as much 
economic as they are political, hopes eventually to go to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Proud and sassy in a new purple T-shirt and yellow skirt, courtesy of the 
Italian Red Cross, Gertruda Reka, 23, a factory worker in Tirana, sought out 
American reporters in the swirling mob of journalists that tracked the 
refugees' every step. 
</P>
<P>
"Do you know Cela Hamide in Yonkers, New York?" she asked in slow, careful 
English. "She is my grandmother. That is where I want to go." 
</P>
<P>
Brindisi's welcome for Adriatic neighbors who have not been seen here for half 
a century began promptly at 9 a.m. on a wind-whipped summer's day when the 
white-over-mustard Espresso Grecia, a U.N. ensign at her forepeak, breasted a 
harbor that once sheltered Imperial Roman merchantmen. 
</P>
<P>
Worried by two tugs and an Italian Coast Guard launch, the ferry jockeyed for a 
berth while 1,000 Albanians at the rails clapped and roared "I-tal-ia, 
I-tal-ia!" just as they had heard soccer fans do on television broadcasts of 
soccer's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
A few hours behind the Espresso Grecia came her sister ship Appia, and the 
Greek ferries Ionis and Cefalonian Sky. Loaded at the same time but 
Marseilles-bound was the Orient Star. 
</P>
<P>
Under international diplomatic protection and tight Albanian police vigilance, 
the refugees had been loaded onto buses in Tirana on Thursday night for the 
20-mile ride to the port. The refugees agreed on that, but not on what happened 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
"The streets were full of soldiers, but people applauded as we passed. You who 
have liberty don't appreciate it, but we Albanians understand what freedom is," 
reported Paret Derani, 65, who said he spent 28 years in jail for political 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
"People watched from streets and balconies in silence as we left. No one 
clapped, no one shouted. It is impossible to shout in Albania," said economist 
Kercani. 
</P>
<P>
If the refugees came in relief and joy, a few came in unsuppressed anger at the 
regime they had fled. 
</P>
<P>
Nevres Tabaku, 59, breathed fire in impeccable Italian from the moment she 
stepped ashore. 
</P>
<P>
"We are known as the 100-year family," she said. "Do you know why? Because 
family members have spent a total of 100 years in their jails. My parents died 
there. We never saw their bodies. My mother, a mother of seven, was arrested 
for the last time when she was 55. 
</P>
<P>
"I have been in jail, my brothers, my sons. We owned a family business when the 
Communists came. At first, they jailed us for no reason, and then for any 
reason. Now, today, we, the whole family, is out. There was no reason any more 
to remain silent. I can say what I want." 
</P>
<P>
Tabaku added that she hopes to join relatives in New York or Florida.

METRO RAIL TUNNEL COLLAPSES IN FIRE; FREEWAY IS CLOSED; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: A 150-FOOT SECTION OF SUBWAY PROJECT CAVES IN. A DOWNTOWN 
THREE-MILE STRETCH OF U.S. 101 WILL REMAIN CLOSED AT LEAST THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

<P>
A stubborn fire raged underground in an uncompleted section of a Metro Rail 
subway in downtown Los Angeles Friday, collapsing a 150-foot stretch of tunnel 
near the Hollywood Freeway and snarling commuter traffic for hours. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which erupted before dawn and burned out of control throughout much 
of the day, produced an eerie scene of flames and smoke shooting from holes in 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire was not immediately determined. California Highway Patrol 
officials said that a three-mile stretch of the freeway, one of the busiest 
arteries through the heart of downtown Los Angeles, would be closed at least 
through the weekend, and possibly next week. 
</P>
<P>
The tenacious fire continued to burn late Friday night and was not expected to 
be fully extinguished until this morning. 
</P>
<P>
It was by far the worst setback to mar construction of the first 4.4-mile phase 
of the Metro Rail subway system, a $1.4-billion project that is running 
millions of dollars over budget and months behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
And it came on the eve of the opening of Metro Rail's intersecting Blue Line 
light-rail system between downtown and Long Beach. Officials said the Blue Line 
would start up today as planned.

<P>
Six workers facing a wall of flame when the fire erupted at 1:50 a.m. escaped 
by dashing under the freeway to safety, but at least four of about 150 
firefighters battling the blaze sustained minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said wooden shoring timbers and highly flammable plastic lining 
burned along the length of the 750-foot subway tunnel for most of the day. 
</P>
<P>
At 2:30 a.m., heavy smoke forced the California Highway Patrol to close a 
downtown portion of the freeway, officially known as U.S. 101, between Mission 
Road and the four-level interchange. Then, a stretch of the tunnel collapsed 
within 10 feet of the freeway, raising fears about the structural safety of the 
roadway. 
</P>
<P>
As for what caused the cave-in, Richard B. Dixon, chief administrative officer 
for the county, reported to the Board of Supervisors that metal rings that bind 
the tunnel together may have failed. 
</P>
<P>
Clouds of moderately toxic smoke from the burning plastic liner forced 
firefighters to wear protective masks, further complicating a task already made 
arduous by high humidity and temperatures that approached the 100-degree mark. 
</P>
<P>
"If hell was like this, I think I would go to church more often," John 
Gonzalez, a firefighter-paramedic from the Studio City station, said as he 
emerged from a 30-minute foray into the burning tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters battled the blaze from both ends of the tunnel, which runs from 
Union Station, under the Hollywood Freeway to a maintenance yard at the 
intersection of Center and Commercial streets. But fears of another collapse 
and the thick smoke, intense heat and toxic fumes prevented firefighters from 
entering the shaft until about 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't put a man in there," a safety engineer said early Friday. "It would 
be like walking into a burning chimney." 
</P>
<P>
In the predawn hours, flames spurted from both ends of the tunnel and at times 
shot 100 feet into the air. 
</P>
<P>
Then at dawn, smaller jets of flame erupted through the ground above the tunnel 
and marched toward the freeway, marking the steady advance of the collapsing 
tunnel. By noon, about 150 feet of the tunnel had caved in. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters at first adopted a "defensive position," aiming fans and fire 
hoses into each end of the tunnel to keep the fire from spreading and to 
dissipate the smoke. There was little else they could do but wait. Plans to 
spray high-density foam into the tunnel were rejected because the suds would 
obscure efforts to survey the damage. A lighter foam was eventually used, which 
enhanced the ability of water to penetrate wood. 
</P>
<P>
"The longer it burns, it's like hot coals on the bottom (of the tunnel)," said 
Fire Capt. John Maleta. "And all that steel will keep the heat. We just have to 
go in there and soak it (the heat) out." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, at 1 p.m., the first four-member team of firefighters, wearing oxygen 
masks and protective clothing, ventured into the northern end of the tunnel, 
where much of the fire had been extinguished. Spraying water on the floor to 
cool their path, they doused flames and crept about 250 feet into the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
One firefighter from the team was scalded by water that got into his boots. 
Once they emerged, several required intravenous fluids. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters planned to install 12-inch timbers across the top of the shaft to 
prevent further collapse. As night fell, workers cleared openings and erected a 
pipeline to pump water and light foam into the burning sections. The work would 
continue all night, but no more teams of firefighters would be dispatched 
underground. 
</P>
<P>
"We're still letting the tunnel cool," Asst. Fire Chief Bob Ramirez said late 
Friday night, as about 25 firefighters kept vigil at the site. 
</P>
<P>
"These are horrible fires to fight," said firefighter Ken Evanoff. "It's just a 
waiting game. You just peck away and peck away hard to get to the seat of the 
thing. You . . . can't just run a bunch of people in there." 
</P>
<P>
It was a matter of dispute as to whether the fire will further delay completion 
of the subway -- already 18 months behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Each day of delay costs an estimated $100,000 in interest and escalating costs, 
but Southern California Rapid Transit District officials said the loss to the 
tunnel itself is covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a tremendous disaster," said Ronald Tutor, president of Tutor-Saliba 
Corp., the contractor building the tunnel. "Part of the tunnel is collapsed. 
The other (tunnel) is subject to review. It is almost mind-boggling." 
</P>
<P>
Tutor said he anticipated that the fire will delay completion of the tunnel by 
a matter of months. It had been three weeks behind schedule and would have been 
finished by Sept. 15, he said. Now, he added, it is "entirely probable" that it 
will not be done until next year. 
</P>
<P>
But state engineers said the fire would probably not delay the September, 1993, 
scheduled opening of the subway. "It should not affect that date," said Al 
Vardanian, a project engineer for RTD. 
</P>
<P>
Gas lines in the area, including one to a federal prison, were turned off as a 
precaution. Even the U.S. Postal Service was affected, with some mail not being 
delivered to areas near the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Commuters fumed in widespread morning traffic jams, and some gave up and went 
back home when they could not reach their downtown destinations. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic officials said smoke from the fire and fears that the roadway over the 
tunnel could collapse prompted closure of a three-mile section of the Hollywood 
Freeway, the so-called "slot." 
</P>
<P>
The result was a massive tie-up that backed up traffic all the way to the 
Foothill Freeway in the Pasadena area and the San Diego Freeway in West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, it affected everything in the system at one point or another," said 
Officer Lydia Martinez of the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Some commuters traveling from the Westside found that traffic, if they got away 
from the freeways, was actually lighter than usual, in part because many people 
just stayed away. For others, it was a different story. 
</P>
<P>
Elaine Taiyoshi, who lives in East Los Angeles, said her usual 15-minute 
commute to the Wells Fargo Tower downtown took two hours. 
</P>
<P>
"It was unbelievable," she said. "I wasn't sure I was going to make it to 
work." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the freeway could remain closed for days, or even weeks, 
depending on how much the underpinnings of the roadway may have been weakened. 
CHP Deputy Chief Edward Gomez said late Friday that the freeway would be closed 
at least through the weekend and possibly into next week. A separate, elevated 
busway may be opened during weekdays for all traffic starting Monday, and 
trucks might be banned to cut down on vibrations, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Drago, a spokesman for the California Department of Transportation, said 
the highway will remain closed until it can be inspected for damage and the 
stability of the soil under the freeway can be assessed. 
</P>
<P>
"If the damage is bad, this could be closed for awhile because the bottom line 
is we're not going to put any traffic on the roadway until we're absolutely 
convinced there is no risk," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the cause of the fire cannot be fully investigated until the 
tunnel has cooled down sufficiently for inspectors to enter. They initially 
ruled out an explosion involving methane gas and spontaneous combustion. 
Several officials said the fire was suspicious because no work had taken place 
in the tunnel for 10 to 12 hours before the blaze erupted. 
</P>
<P>
Work in the tunnel involved installation of the plastic lining and "shouldn't 
involve any kind of flammable material or anything that would smolder" or 
equipment that would spark a fire, said Harold Stories, director of 
construction safety for RTD. 
</P>
<P>
Neil Peterson, executive director of the Los Angeles County Transportation 
Commission, said an independent investigation of the fire's cause will be 
conducted by Minneapolis-based Kellogg Engineering. A preliminary report is 
expected within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
But early speculation centered on arson. 
</P>
<P>
Byron Ishkanian, Cal/OSHA's senior mining and tunneling engineer, said he 
suspected the fire was started by transients, who have crept onto the project's 
property through openings along the Los Angeles River and started a fire 
elsewhere on Metro Rail property last week. 
</P>
<P>
"I just can't help but think it was something like that. It was the only way 
you could get ignition," said Ishkanian, who was in charge of safety for the 
overall Metro Rail project until May, when he quit to join Cal/OSHA. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel that burned was one of two parallel shafts -- A-130 Left and A-130 
Right -- which are not to be used for passenger traffic between MacArthur Park 
and Union Station. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they will carry empty trains between Union Station and a maintenance 
yard now under construction beside the Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
As they were dug, each tunnel was shored with wooden beams -- each about six 
inches thick, 12 inches wide and four feet long -- held in place against the 
tunnel wall by a series of 17-foot steel rings that extend down the length of 
the tunnel like the ribs of a whale. Fiber packing was crammed between the 
beams to ensure a tight fit. 
</P>
<P>
The shoring was then covered by a polyethelene membrane about one-eighth of an 
inch thick to seal out flammable gases like methane that abound underground in 
the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
Tunnel A-130 Right is largely completed, its shoring and liner covered with a 
thick concrete lining. But in Tunnel A-130 Left, the one that was burning, the 
concrete had yet to be poured and the flammable packing and liners were still 
exposed. No underground passageways connect the tunnels, which are about 12 
feet apart and top out about 15 feet below the pavement of the Hollywood 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials said the blaze apparently started at about 1:50 a.m. in A-130 
Left. No one was in that tunnel at the time, but a half-dozen men were working 
in A-130 Right. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Greene, a spokeswoman for the RTD, which has overall authority over the 
project, said that the workers heard the roar of the flames in the adjacent 
tunnel and ran to the west end of their tunnel to escape.

<P>
A REPORT ON RADIATION NEAR THE HANFORD PLANT CONFIRMS RESIDENTS' FEARS. AND THE 
GOVERNMENT KNEW ALL ALONG, SOME SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Betty Perkes has always known that something wasn't right. Five of the seven 
members of her family are on thyroid medication. So it came as little surprise 
when the federal government admitted this week that the radiation releases 
decades ago from the atomic weapons plant nearby were big enough to leave 
people seriously ill. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Perkes furious is that the releases appear to have been intentional. 
The federal government knew about them; it even monitored their effects. And it 
is that chilling notion that fuels the worst fears of Hanford Nuclear 
Reservation "downwinders" like Perkes -- the idea that perhaps they were part 
of a secret experiment. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, our government was so good to us," Perkes said Friday in the white brick 
farmhouse her husband built on land the government sold at a discount to Korean 
War veterans during a time that the government was building up its weapons 
program. 
</P>
<P>
"They brought us out here and they used us for guinea pigs . . . . How dare 
they do that to us? And without asking if we wanted to be experimented on. How 
dare they!" 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of Energy and a special investigative panel acknowledged 
this week that thousands of men, women and children living in the 10 counties 
surrounding the Hanford reservation were exposed between 1944 and 1947 to doses 
of radioactive iodine 131 that were large enough to cause significant 
illnesses, including thyroid disease and cancer. By some estimates, no other 
group of civilians in the world is known to have been exposed to as much 
radiation over such a period of time. 
</P>
<P>
The iodine, produced in the process of making plutonium for nuclear bombs, is 
believed to have landed on vegetation and to have been eaten by cows in the 
fertile farmland downwind of the reservation. Iodine accumulates in the human 
thyroid gland and can cause abnormalities. It is believed to have posed the 
greatest risk to infants who were fed on locally produced milk. 
</P>
<P>
It remains unclear, however, how many illnesses might have been caused by the 
releases, which first came to light through a public records act request by a 
public interest group in 1986. At that time, it became clear that the 
government not only knew about some of the releases but may have even planned 
them and set out to monitor the effects. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
First Phase 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the government for the first time admitted that the releases were 
enough to result in illness. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Centers for Disease Control and a Seattle-based cancer research 
center have begun a study of the extent and severity of thyroid disease in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
The findings came from just the first phase of the five-year federally funded 
Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project, which examined airborne 
radioactive iodine emissions in the 1940s and radioactive cooling water poured 
into the Columbia River from 1964 to 1967. The panel has yet to examine other 
time periods, including a December, 1949, experiment in which radioactive 
iodine and other fission products were released in a plume that extended as far 
as Spokane. 
</P>
<P>
"Prior to yesterday's announcement, there were very few people willing to even 
consider the fact that this had happened," said Lois Camp, 48, who grew up in 
Kahlotus, northeast of Hanford in the path of the prevailing west-to-east winds 
and who fears her heart condition may be related to radioactive releases. "I 
don't want to rain on the parade of this announcement, but it must be a 
beginning, not an end. The thyroid disease is just the tip of the iceberg." 
</P>
<P>
Word of the announcements hit hard this week in the small cities and farm towns 
east and northeast of the nuclear reservation, nestled between and around the 
Snake and Columbia rivers. This is an area that residents themselves describe 
as patriotic, conservative and God-fearing. As third-generation farmer Tom 
Bailie puts it, they take "a hairy-chested attitude to life." 
</P>
<P>
So there were some here who chose not to believe the disturbing news. They 
blamed the media, anti-nuclear groups, perhaps a few desperate "downwinders," 
the name taken by several hundred residents who have pressed for investigations 
of the releases. 
</P>
<P>
Orville Weiss, for example, who hauls seed potato, referred to the issue as a 
lot of "squawkin' and hollerin' " and suggested, "If someone don't control 
those environmentalists, the human race is going to be extinct." 
</P>
<P>
But there were others who admitted that the announcements had given them pause. 
For the first time, they said, they had begun taking stock. Carole Hackwith, 
52, a mother of five whose husband is a surveyor at Hanford, began pondering 
her recollection that 13 people on the block where she grew up had come down 
with various cancers, including her parents and herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are really beginning to wonder a little bit," Hackwith said 
Thursday evening, as the sunset turned the sky pink and the temperature dipped 
toward 100 for the first time all day. ". . . It makes me feel sad that this 
sort of thing happens. I'm sure it was just ignorance. I don't want to believe 
that my government would do this thing on purpose." 
</P>
<P>
Deanna Louderback, who has thyroid disease, was even skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think angry would be the word. Disappointed more than anything, and a 
little bit leery," said Louderback, who developed the disease at age 28, along 
with two close high school friends. "We were deceived once, by them letting it 
out, and deliberately. You wonder, if they weren't honest about it once, are 
they being honest now?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mix of Emotions 
</P>
<P>
For the downwinders themselves, the news confirmed what many had suspected for 
years. So they spoke about it with a mix of emotions: There was some relief, at 
being vindicated in the eyes of their community; anger, at having been betrayed 
by the government; and terror, at the thought of the long-term implications of 
what they now know to be true. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Bailie is a 43-year-old farmer in the community of Mesa. He rattles off the 
cancers and birth defects in his family like bowling scores. As for himself, he 
says he was born in 1947 with crooked legs, a sunken chest cavity and twisted 
fingers. His five children are adopted because he is sterile. The bones in his 
ankle seem to crinkle like cellophane when he pivots. 
</P>
<P>
Bailie believes the government's acknowledgement of the magnitude of the 
radioactive releases will begin finally to erode what he sees as the region's 
unwillingness to admit there was a problem -- an unwillingness he and others 
attribute to the powerful role Hanford has played in their lives as both the 
area's largest employer and a cultural icon. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a community whose entire economic well-being depends on nuclear 
weapons production, and people have pledged total loyalty to it," said Bailie. 
In the land of the Atomic Body Shop, the Atomic Bowling Center, Atomic Lawn 
Care and Atomic Plumbing and Mechanical, Bailie invoked perhaps the most 
poignant image of that loyalty, the Richland High School football team's 
symbol, a mushroom cloud. 
</P>
<P>
Some farmers, fearful that they now may face a boycott of their products, were 
reluctant to speak about the releases. Having watched the Alar scare decimate 
the market of apple farmers in the Wenatchee Valley to the northwest, they fear 
that concerns about radioactive crops, no matter how unfounded, could do the 
same to their livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
Yet one farmer, who asked not to be named, confessed that family members no 
longer eat their own beef or milk. They drink bottled water rather than rely on 
their well. They take those precautions despite the fact that federal officials 
and investigators insist there is no residual contamination in the land and in 
the crops and animals that grow and feed there. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he would like to move away from the area, the farmer answered 
with anguish, "How do you sell property that's contaminated? How do you take 
everything you have earned and do it to someone else? Is that ethical?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Want Help 
</P>
<P>
What the downwinders want now is a comprehensive study of the health effects of 
the releases. Many want federal help in covering their mounting medical bills. 
So far, they say they have been prevented from suing by the government's claim 
of so-called sovereign immunity, a doctrine that protects the federal 
government against liability. 
</P>
<P>
Some expressed the hope that physicians would now attend more closely to their 
medical problems, which some said have been met in the past with skepticism and 
disbelief. And a few downwinders said they want names -- the names of whoever 
it was who permitted the releases that they believe made them and their 
children sick. 
</P>
<P>
"They have finally admitted what we have known and wanted them to admit," said 
Betty Perkes. "Now I want them to have to always be careful, to set up 
safeguards and checks so this horrible, horrible disaster can never be 
repeated." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contamination From Hanford 
</P>
<P>
One rad is the amount of radiation a body organ would absorb from about a dozen 
chest X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
Up to 13,500 people may have received doses of more than 33 rads from milk they 
drank. 
</P>
<P>
About 1,400 infants and children in the area received from 15 to 650. 
</P>
<P>
A small number of infants may have received doses of 2,900 rads or more.

RED CROSS NEGLIGENCE THREATENS BLOOD SAFETY, PANEL SAYS 
</P>

<P>
The nation's blood supply is not as safe as it should be because of inadequate 
screening and reporting by the American Red Cross and other blood suppliers, a 
congressional panel charged Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Various Red Cross collection centers have released infected blood, mixed up 
records, violated AIDS testing procedures and failed to deter infected or 
undesirable donors," said Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House 
Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations. 
</P>
<P>
Dingell said the problems were documented by Food and Drug Administration 
inspection reports and "the Red Cross' own internal reports." 
</P>
<P>
Dingell's subcommittee heard testimony on a preliminary FDA report, released 
earlier this week, that cited cases in which patients were infected by the 
virus that causes AIDS or received serious bacterial infections as a result of 
apparent Red Cross negligence. 
</P>
<P>
Red Cross executives, who were not invited to testify before the panel, 
disputed some of the charges outside the hearing room. 
</P>
<P>
"We resent the manner in which this was made public," said Stephen H. Richards, 
senior vice president of the American Red Cross. "This raises a lot of serious 
and very complicated questions to which we wish we had a chance to respond." 
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross is preparing a full written reply to the FDA investigation. The 
response will be released next week, Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
In testimony before the panel, Mary T. Carden, the FDA's chief biological 
investigator, charged that Red Cross regional blood centers either delayed or 
failed to file reports about cases of contaminated blood. 
</P>
<P>
Even when regional centers filed the required reports, she said, the national 
headquarters failed in many cases to report them to the FDA, as required under 
government regulations. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, she cited three cases in the Washington, D.C., area in the last 
year in which patients died from serious bacterial infections after receiving 
blood products distributed by the Red Cross. The cases were not reported to the 
FDA, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Richards, however, said that, because of their seriousness, the Red Cross had 
reported the incidents to the FDA by telephone immediately after learning of 
them and saw no need to file subsequent written reports. 
</P>
<P>
Carden said some of the problems could be traced to the computer system used by 
the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
Carden charged also that the organization, which supplies more than half of the 
nation's blood supply, was unhelpful and "nonchalant" during her investigation. 
"There were no promises of corrective action," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Richards contested Carden's characterization and said the report "is something 
which we take very seriously." 
</P>
<P>
The subcommittee heard testimony from a panel of experts concerning AIDS 
contamination of the nation's blood supply that occurred before the test to 
determine the presence of the human immunodeficiency virus was developed in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
Panel members, including Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), said the Red Cross and other 
blood suppliers "dragged their feet" in implementing blood-screening procedures 
that would test for hepatitis and other diseases that sometimes are found in 
connection with the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
Before the advent of the HIV test, witnesses said, screening for the other 
diseases could have reduced significantly the extent of contamination. They 
cited studies indicating that such "surrogate" tests could detect 94% to 98% of 
blood donors infected with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
But Red Cross executives said the evidence at the time was equivocal and other

Richards said that 48 hours after the HIV test was licensed in March, 1985, the 
Red Cross began distributing test kits to its regional blood centers. 
</P>
<P>
Subcommittee members also criticized the Red Cross for understating the number 
of AIDS cases that have resulted from contaminated blood transfusions. 
</P>
<P>
Richards acknowledged that in a statement issued earlier this week the 
organization erroneously said there have been only six such cases since 1985, 
when in fact there have been 11 or 12. 
</P>
<P>
Subcommittee members said they lacked sufficient time to include the Red Cross 
in the hearing but that the organization will have an opportunity to testify 
before the panel this fall.

A NASSER ON TRIAL IN EGYPT

They struck four times, usually in the summer. On one occasion, an Israeli 
security officer was killed, as he drove from his home in the fashionable 
suburb of Maadi, by gunmen who sprayed automatic gunfire into his car, wounding 
his wife and an embassy secretary. On another, four Israelis were shot at the 
International Fairgrounds, one of them fatally. 
</P>
<P>
The last attack occurred on May 26, 1987, when gunmen opened fire on a car 
carrying the chief of security for the U.S. Embassy and two of his deputies. 
They sped away with a few scratches. A mysterious organization calling itself 
Egypt's Revolution said the intention of that attack was to send "Reagan's 
despised CIA agents to where we sent their Israeli henchmen before them -- to 
hell." 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the attackers were not members of a Palestinian terrorist 
cell or an extremist Muslim group, the sort whose communiques have become 
chillingly familiar in a region often ruled by sudden violence. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptian investigators soon began to realize that Egypt's Revolution was a 
home-grown terrorist organization that included senior army officers, current 
and retired. One of its leaders, prosecutors say, was the eldest son of Egypt's 
legendary former president, Gamal Abdel Nasser. 
</P>
<P>
Khalid Abdel Nasser returned voluntarily to Egypt last month to face trial 
after years in exile in Yugoslavia, propelling the case into the headlines 
again. It also reminded President Hosni Mubarak's government of the enduring 
popularity of the man who threw off British imperialism, made Egypt the patron 
of the Arab world, nationalized the vast holdings of Egypt's elite and 
stubbornly battled, until his untimely death in 1970 at the age of 52, against 
Israeli attempts to gain new footholds in Arab territory. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say Khalid Abdel Nasser's return couldn't have come at a worse time 
for Mubarak, who is facing increasing public dissent over rising food and gas 
prices and a deadlocked peace process with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"Camp David," a Western diplomat said, "is perhaps less accepted than it has 
ever been before; the peace process is at a halt; the rule of the government is 
less than it has ever been. If you're going to choose a time to come and cause 
discord, it's not a bad time to choose." 
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's government faces intense pressure from Washington to prosecute the 
case, along with corresponding pressure from Arab hard-liners to go easy on the 
son of a national hero. Prosecutors have publicly sought the death penalty for 
Nasser and 10 of the 20 other defendants. 
</P>
<P>
"How can we execute the son of Gamal Abdel Nasser for killing Israelis, our 
enemies?" asked Khalid Mohieddin, who helped Nasser plot the 1952 revolution. 
Mohieddin, for whom Khalid Abdel Nasser was named, now heads a leftist 
coalition that includes the modern-day Nasserites. 
</P>
<P>
"There is peace between Israel and Egypt," said Mohieddin, who also heads a 
committee of Arab politicians and intellectuals for the defense of the 
revolution. "The government signed a treaty. But the majority of the Egyptian 
people consider Israel as the first enemy." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys have challenged the confessions by several of the defendants, 
arguing that they were obtained under torture. 
</P>
<P>
But the defense is also arguing that even if the allegations are true, the 
attacks did not constitute a crime. Egypt's 1979 peace treaty, they argue, was 
illegal because Egypt, as part of the "Arab nation," had no authority to make a 
separate peace with Israel and remains, therefore, at war. 
</P>
<P>
In court, Prosecutor Ragaa Arabi scoffed at the defense, saying: "There is no 
glory in assassinating women and diplomats on Egyptian soil. The true heroic 
deed is the Palestinian intifada, the struggle of an entire people against 
occupation (by Israel)." 
</P>
<P>
Arabi described the defendants as "inhuman, depraved criminals who wanted to 
portray themselves as nationalist heroes." Of Nasser's son, he said: "To desire 
fame and power is his right as a citizen. However, Khalid took the path of 
crime to realize his goals, and for this he must be penalized, regardless of 
who his father was."

CASTRO LOSING LAST SUPPORT IN CONGRESS

<P>
Cuba's Fidel Castro has lost his last friend in the U.S. Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.), chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, 
after 30 years of advocating normal relations with Cuba and the lifting of the 
economic embargo imposed by President John F. Kennedy, has changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Echoing a demand made by U.S. conservatives, Pell took the Senate floor last 
week to call on Castro to permit "free and fair elections under international 
supervision" and let the Cuban people decide their own future. 
</P>
<P>
Pell not only ended his support for Castro; he also called for efforts to 
tighten economic sanctions against him. 
</P>
<P>
"While almost the entire Communist world is changing and moving toward 
democracy, greater individual freedoms and more open and free market economies, 
Cuba is moving in an opposite direction," the Rhode Island Democrat said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dissidents Arrested 
</P>
<P>
Citing the arrest of a score of Cuban human rights advocates since March, he 
said Castro is converting his domain into the "Albania or the North Korea of 
the Caribbean." 
</P>
<P>
Pell had been the last senator with a liberal position on Cuba. An earlier 
ally, Sen. Lowell Weicker, a maverick Republican from Connecticut, lost his bid 
for reelection two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
American liberals backed Castro's revolutionary struggle in the 1950s, and many 
remained supportive after he won power in 1959 and embraced communism. Despite 
disapproval by both Democratic and Republican administrations, liberal members 
of Congress also showed sympathy for the Cuban regime, the only 
Marxist-Leninist government in the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
The high point of U.S.-Cuban relations came in 1977, when Castro and President 
Jimmy Carter partially restored official ties with the establishment of 
interest sections -- quasi-diplomatic missions far below the embassy level -- 
in each other's capitals. 
</P>
<P>
But the Mariel boatlift of 1980, in which Castro allowed felons and the 
mentally ill to join political refugees as 125,000 Cubans flooded into the 
United States, combined with renewed repression on the island to change the way 
many Americans looked at Cuba and its aging leader. 
</P>
<P>
In the late '80s, Castro harshly rejected Soviet President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev's socialist reforms, chilling relations with what had been Cuba's 
most generous benefactor and aligning Castro with the world's few remaining 
practitioners of true Marxist-Leninism. 
</P>
<P>
Some might view Pell's change of mind against a political background. After 
years of token opposition, he is facing a serious opponent in Rhode Island this 
November: Republican Rep. Claudine Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
In the House, Rep. Dante B. Fascell (D-Fla.) took a firm anti-Castro line when 
he assumed the chairmanship of a largely liberal Foreign Affairs Committee in 
1983, reflecting the strength of Cuban-American voters in his district. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Peter H. Kostmayer (D-Pa.), who once met with Castro and has favored 
easing U.S.-Cuban tension, reflected the changing mood of Congress in a recent 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
"Castro sticks out like a sore thumb, and he focuses attention on Cuba and the 
bad human rights situation there," Kostmayer said, explaining his support for a 
pending House resolution condemning Castro on the human rights issue. 
</P>
<P>
Kostmayer is a candidate for the chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs 
subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs, which will become vacant with the 
retirement this year of Rep. George W. Crockett Jr. (D-Mich.), an advocate of 
negotiation rather than force in dealing with Castro. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pressure Needed 
</P>
<P>
Kostmayer said he now believes in exerting pressure to promote change in Cuba, 
but he voiced doubt over a congressional effort to ban trading with Havana by 
U.S. subsidiaries in third countries. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt if it's even legal outside of wartime," Kostmayer said. "I think it's 
a bad idea." 
</P>
<P>
The trade ban is set forth in an amendment , proposed by Sen. Connie Mack 
(R-Fla.), to the 1990 Chemical Weapons Act, which is expected to go to 
conference this month. 
</P>
<P>
The Bush Administration and other governments, among them Canada's, have spoken 
out against the amendment. A similar law was removed from the books in the 
1970s after Argentina threatened to nationalize a Ford plant unless Washington 
permitted Argentine-made Ford products to be exported to Cuba.

SHANGHAI MAYOR TOURS U.S., SEEKS TO REVIVE GOODWILL; 
</P>
<P>
CHINA: ZHU IS A RISING STAR WHO COULD BE A FUTURE GORBACHEV. BUT HE APPARENTLY 
SEES NO NEED NOW FOR SOVIET-STYLE RESTRUCTURING.

China's most urbane and polished leader, the man some Westerners hope may 
become a future Chinese version of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, is barnstorming the 
United States, seeking to revive American goodwill and business interest in his 
beleaguered country. 
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji, the top politician in China's largest city and one 
of the rising stars of the Chinese Communist Party, is the highest-ranking 
official to visit the United States since his government called in troops to 
crush pro-democracy demonstrations last year. 
</P>
<P>
Zhu stopped in New York City and Washington this week and will visit Los 
Angeles and San Francisco later this month. He is part of a delegation of six 
Chinese mayors invited to the United States by the National Committee on 
U.S.-China Relations. 
</P>
<P>
At each stop, Zhu pleads for American forbearance and understanding of the 
turmoil in China last year and of the differences between the two countries' 
political systems. 
</P>
<P>
"You have your system of democracy, and we have our system of democracy," he 
said at a press conference in Washington. "But that does not mean we have 
nothing in common." 
</P>
<P>
(The Chinese Communist Party refers to China's political system as a "socialist 
democracy," which it readily admits is different than what it calls 
Western-style democracy. China's constitution requires obedience to the 
leadership of the Communist Party and "the dictatorship of the proletariat.") 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Zhu and the other five mayors got a warm welcome from the Bush 
Administration this week. They were greeted at the White House by National 
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and at the State Department by Deputy 
Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger. 
</P>
<P>
A White House spokesman said the sessions did not violate the Administration 
policy against high-level exchanges between U.S. and Chinese leaders, because 
"mayors are not high-level officials." Scowcroft and Eagleburger traveled twice 
to Beijing last year to meet with Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and other top 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials clearly view Zhu as a possible future leader of China. One 
Administration analyst said that he believes Zhu will be moved to Beijing in a 
top leadership post this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Zhu, 61, probably has had more extensive exposure to the thinking of Western 
economists and business leaders than any other senior Chinese leader, with the 
possible exception of former Party Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who is now under 
house arrest. Before becoming mayor of Shanghai in 1988, Zhu was in charge of 
Chinese efforts to attract Western investment. 
</P>
<P>
Although thousands of democracy demonstrators blocked the streets of Shanghai 
for several days in June, 1989, Zhu managed to defuse the crisis without 
imposing martial law on the city and without the bloody violence suffered in 
Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
Zhu's name crops up when Western analysts of China try to imagine which future 
Chinese Communist Party leader might succeed in taking power and instigating 
fundamental political changes, in the fashion of Gorbachev. 
</P>
<P>
There is no sign at the moment, however, that Zhu sees the need for 
Soviet-style perestroika, or political restructuring, in China. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he believes that there should be any restrictions on the 
authority of the Communist Party, he told reporters that the party's efforts 
are aimed at improving government policies and the legal system. 
</P>
<P>
"I see no reason to put restrictions on that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As for congressional concerns about human rights violations in China, Zhu 
declared, "It is we ourselves who are most concerned about our own human 
rights." The mayor said that the 1989 demonstrations in Shanghai prevented 
residents from getting food, forced women to walk long distances to work and 
blocked the transportation of bodies to funeral parlors. 
</P>
<P>
At his Washington press conference, Zhu said that fewer than 10 people remain 
in detention in Shanghai as a result of those demonstrations. A few hours 
earlier, however, the State Department had told Congress that about 80 of the 
1989 protesters are being detained in Shanghai. 
</P>
<P>
Zhu acknowledges that he is concerned about flagging American business interest 
in China, once viewed as a potentially lucrative future market. Previously, the 
mayor said, the United States accounted for about a third of all foreign 
investment in Shanghai. This year, it has dropped to only a quarter of the 
total. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that this year, the American investment will increase again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Zhu made one gibe at the new Western fascination with Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had 10 years of experience in dealing with foreign investors," Zhu said. 
". . . As to Eastern Europe, I think it may be necessary for them to collect 
some experience." 
</P>
<P>
While in Southern California on July 22 and 23, the mayors will visit the Port 
of Los Angeles, Disneyland, the RAND Corp., McDonnell-Douglas Corp., and the 
Los Angeles-Guangzhou Sister City Assn. They also will stop by City Hall to 
talk with Mayor Tom Bradley.

<P>
A British Cabinet minister's anti-German diatribe in a magazine interview may 
have triggered a wave of official outrage across Europe, but it has also 
highlighted a large and growing double standard in attitudes toward German 
unity. 
</P>
<P>
Behind the polite applause and lofty declarations of support for German 
unification echoing through the conference halls of Europe, another emotion 
dominates -- a gnawing worry about the power of a united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
It is an emotion widely felt but rarely expressed in public, a feeling that has 
intensified as outsiders watch the speed and apparent ease with which unity 
unfolds. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, even in private, few go as far as British Trade and Industry 
Secretary Nicholas Ridley did in his interview published Thursday in the 
respected British weekly The Spectator. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of a three-page interview, he described efforts to forge a 
European monetary union as "a German racket designed to take over the whole of 
Europe," accused France of "behaving like poodles to the Germans" and stopped 
just short of comparing Adolf Hitler favorably with West German Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Ridley quickly retracted his comments, made in Hungary, the level 
of indignation may cost him his job. 
</P>
<P>
"The man who the cartoonists loved to depict as a corpse (has) become one," 
Peter Jenkins of the Independent newspaper wrote. "It will be flown home from 
Hungary today and buried quietly over the weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Other commentators said Ridley would be an obstacle in negotiations with 
Britain's European allies, especially West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
While the tone of Ridley's remarks was clearly contentious, he was also 
discussing a subject that politicians have tried to avoid in order not to stoke 
enmity or be seen casting suspicion on an ally. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some argued Friday that Ridley's only real sin was to discuss the 
subject at all. 
</P>
<P>
"As embarrassing as Ridley's comments are, it's hard to dispute that they have 
brought into the public domain a subject usually discussed only on the quiet," 
commented the Swiss daily, Neue Zuercher Zeitung. 
</P>
<P>
Added the West Germany newspaper Frankfurter Rundschau: "The feelings, the 
fears, the prejudices that came from the minister's mouth are the feelings, 
fears and prejudices shared by many of his countrymen." 
</P>
<P>
How these fears are handled, both by a uniting Germany and its neighbors, will 
do much to determine the spirit in which a powerful German state is born -- 
whether it is welcomed into the community of Western democracies or ostracized 
and left to sulk as a rejected, potentially dangerous outsider. 
</P>
<P>
"There are only two paths for German unity -- either a nationalist path or a 
European path," noted Bonn University historian Karl-Dieter Bracher. "The best 
way to control the Germans is binding them into an integrated Europe. Anything 
else is dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
While both German governments insist that they want unity as part of a larger 
European unity, this has done little to allay the undercurrent of concern. 
</P>
<P>
"In part, it's a generational thing," said West German spokesman Dieter Vogel. 
"Younger people are more relaxed about unity. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lived with this for a long time," Vogel added. "We'll have to live with 
it a while longer." 
</P>
<P>
In the democracies of northern Europe, there are few foreign policy issues 
where private reservations contrast so sharply with unqualified public backing. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not next month or next year I'm worried about," said a respected Western 
ambassador who has served in the region for several years. "It's 10, 15 years 
from now, when they've gotten used to their size and their strength -- that's 
the time I worry about." 
</P>
<P>
The 12 European Community leaders last month officially blessed unification at 
their summit in Dublin. But, unofficially, more than one of those present would 
have nodded approvingly at the well-known, tongue-in-cheek comment of French 
author Francois Mauriac that he loved Germany so much that he was happy there 
were two of them. 
</P>
<P>
In the weeks after the Berlin Wall fell, French President Francois Mitterrand 
and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher strayed from their longstanding 
endorsement of German unity, until they realized that it was inevitable. Like 
others who now cheer unity, they decided that to oppose German public will at 
this point would be politically disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
East Europeans also fear German unity. But free of alliance or ties to the 
European Community, they express their worries more openly -- especially the 
Soviet Union, where such concerns constitute a key stumbling block in 
negotiations on the external aspects of unification. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles Times/Economist magazine poll published last month found that 
half of those surveyed in Britain and France expressed concern about a dominant 
Germany. In Poland, the figure was nearly 70%. This level of public worry in 
Europe is a key factor separating the Bush Administration's unwavering support 
for unity from Europe's double standard. 
</P>
<P>
When asked recently why German-American ties had become so close, Kohl's answer 
was a not-so-subtle swipe at his European allies. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some who mean it when they speak of the right to 
self-determination," he said.

SOVIETS FREE 169 JAPANESE FISHERMEN

Twelve North Korean-flagged, Japanese-owned fishing vessels and their crewmen 
on Friday left the Soviet port of Nakhodka, where they had been held for two 
months for poaching Soviet salmon, the Foreign Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
The boats were heading for North Korea's port of Hungnam. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass said the ships' captains estimated their 
vessels were carrying 500 tons of fish, worth about $8 million. 
</P>
<P>
The ships have North Korean officers, but about three-quarters of their crews 
are Japanese. A Japanese spokesman said North Korea promised to return the 169 
Japanese to Japan "without delay." 
</P>
<P>
The seizure of the boats led to an unusual tug-of-war between the Soviet Union, 
North Korea and Japan over fishing in salmon-rich waters off the Soviet coast. 
</P>
<P>
Japan has a fishing agreement with the Soviet Union and there is a quota for 
Soviet salmon. North Korean has no quota, but its vessels were sometimes 
allowed to fish in Soviet waters, and experts said this may have enticed 
Japanese operators to put their vessels under the North Korean flag.

Czechoslovakia plans to evacuate its women and children living in Cuba in a 
worsening diplomatic dispute with Havana, Prague television reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation has become aggravated to such an extent that all Czechoslovak 
women and children will leave Cuba shortly, probably Sunday morning," said the 
report, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. Tension has been building 
between Prague and Havana over 14 Cuban dissidents who have sought asylum in 
the Czechoslovak Embassy in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
In Prague, Deputy Foreign Minister Lubos Dobrovsky summoned Cuba's ambassador, 
Mario Rodriguez Martinez, and demanded that Cuba ensure the safety of 
Czechoslovaks in Cuba.

POLAND PLANS TO SELL OFF STATE-OWNED INDUSTRIES

Poland surged out in front of the pack of reform governments in Eastern Europe 
on Friday as the main chamber of its legislature passed a landmark bill to 
dismantle state ownership of industries and sell them off to private investors. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz said the privatization bill, which applies 
to 7,600 state enterprises, "is going to change the Polish economy more 
radically than anything done up to now." 
</P>
<P>
The government owns 80% of industry in Poland, including steel mills, coal 
mines and factories. None of the state enterprises would be off-limits to 
privatization, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The bill is the centerpiece of the Solidarity-led government's plan to 
restructure the centrally planned socialist economy along Western free-market 
lines. Its passage marks a much-needed victory for government leaders, who 
recently have been accused by Solidarity union leader Lech Walesa of offering 
Poles little more than economic hardship. 
</P>
<P>
Austerity measures in the first six months of the year have ended 
hyper-inflation, but at a higher than predicted social price. 
</P>
<P>
The country is mired in a severe recession that has cut economic activity by 
30%. Unemployment, which did not officially exist before this year, has soared. 
At the end of June, 570,000 people, or 4.2% of the work force, were jobless, 
and that figure is expected to double by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
The privatization bill was approved overwhelmingly 328 to 2 with 39 abstentions 
by the Sejm, or lower house, as former Communists and independent lawmakers 
voted with the Solidarity caucus. Approval by the Solidarity-dominated Senate 
is expected. 
</P>
<P>
All Polish citizens will be given "privatization bonds" that can be redeemed 
for company stocks, allowing the estimated 65% of Polish families with no 
savings to become shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
The bill had been bogged down in committee for more than three months as the 
government wrestled with workers' demands that they be granted special rights 
to own shares in the companies that employ them. 
</P>
<P>
There were also widespread fears among Poles that privatization could lead to 
an uncontrolled, bargain-priced selloff of Polish industry to foreigners.

A spokesman for Myanmar's military regime indicated that a leading dissident 
under house arrest since last July will not be released next week as scheduled 
and warned her party not to try to declare a government because of its 
landslide election victory. Maj. Gen. Khim Nyunt, head of military 
intelligence, said the junta will not yield to international pressure for the 
release of Aung San Suu Kyi and a transfer of power to her National League for 
Democracy. Suu Kyi, daughter of the country's foremost independence hero when 
it was Burma, was placed under house arrest July 20, 1989. She has never been 
formally charged.

Ethiopian leader Mengistu Haile Mariam is denying 10,000 Jews permission to 
emigrate to Israel as a way to get military supplies from the Jewish state, a 
leader of the Ethiopian community in Israel said. 
</P>
<P>
The accusation comes amid reports that Mengistu's hard-line Marxist government 
is teetering as secessionist rebels gain ground in their battle to topple him. 
Rahamin Elazar, chairman of the Public Council for Ethiopian Affairs in Israel, 
said Mengistu is demanding arms from Israel in exchange for allowing Jews to 
leave his country. An Israeli government spokesman denied the charge.

FUEL LEAKS ON SHUTTLES APPEAR UNRELATED;

The hydrogen leaks crippling space shuttles Atlantis and Columbia appear to be 
in different places, ruling out the possibility that the problems are related, 
NASA said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"The things that we know leak on one we know aren't leaking on the other," said 
William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program. 
</P>
<P>
A common problem with the shuttles' fuel system would have been much more 
difficult to deal with, said shuttle director Robert Crippen. 
</P>
<P>
Early indications after an elaborate test of Atlantis' fuel system Friday are 
that hydrogen escaped from a flange on the external tank side of a 
17-inch-diameter valve, Lenoir said. The valve is in a pipe that carries fuel 
from the tank to the main engines. 
</P>
<P>
No leaks were found in that area on the plumbing from Columbia that was sent 
for laboratory testing to shuttle builder Rockwell International Corp. in 
Downey, Calif., Lenoir said. 
</P>
<P>
Lenoir said the problem with Columbia has been corrected since new plumbing was 
installed in the faulty area. The new components were taken from the shuttle 
Endeavour, under construction in California. 
</P>
<P>
It's too soon to say how NASA will deal with Atlantis' leak, Lenoir said. 
</P>
<P>
The solution may be as simple as tightening the seal, which could be done at 
the launching pad. Putting in a new seal would require a return to the hangar, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
NASA wants to launch at least one shuttle before Discovery's scheduled flight 
with the sun-exploring Ulysses satellite in October, Crippen said. The most 
likely candidate is Atlantis, on a classified Defense Department mission. 
</P>
<P>
Discovery has until Oct. 23 to lift off with Ulysses because of the alignment 
of Earth, the sun and Jupiter. Otherwise, the flight must be delayed for 13 
months. 
</P>
<P>
Lenoir said there is no reason to believe that Discovery has a leak. It is 
uncertain whether that shuttle will undergo a tanking test before launching, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Columbia's leak was discovered during fueling for a May 30 launching attempt. A 
test a week later duplicated the leak, and the shuttle was returned to the 
hangar for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
As a precaution, NASA conducted a similar test on Atlantis on June 29 as the 
shuttle awaited a mid-July liftoff. A leak was detected, and the agency 
grounded the three-shuttle fleet. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time all of the shuttles had been grounded since the 1986 
Challenger explosion. The next shuttle did not fly until 1988. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, meanwhile, NASA Administrator Richard H. Truly admitted Friday 
that mirror flaws blurring the Hubble Space Telescope's view of the universe 
could have been detected by a simple, safe and inexpensive test. 
</P>
<P>
"With hindsight, we can determine that a test could have been done that would 
not have had the potential of contaminating the mirror and would have found 
this aberration," Truly told a congressional committee. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, space agency officials had said they had not conducted a test of 
the $1.5-billion telescope as a whole, which could have detected the crippling 
mistake, because it would have been very expensive and risked contaminating the 
pristine mirror. 
</P>
<P>
It is unclear which would have been the best test to detect the flaw and why 
such a test was not conducted, they said. A panel probing the blunder should 
determine exactly how the error occurred and why it was not detected before the 
telescope was placed into space on April 25, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Truly acknowledged that the problem with the telescope and the subsequent 
grounding of the space shuttle fleet due to a fuel leak had "eroded" public 
confidence in the agency. 
</P>
<P>
But Lennard Fisk, NASA's associate administrator of space science and 
applications, stressed that the telescope can still carry out valuable 
scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
"Categorically, Hubble is not a dud," Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
The telescope can learn important things by studying ultraviolet light until 
new observatory cameras are installed by the space shuttle in several years to 
compensate for the flaw -- a slightly incorrect curve in one of the telescope's 
two light-focusing mirrors.

ROEMER WILL NOT SIGN ABORTION BILL BUT MAY LET IT BECOME LAW

Gov. Buddy Roemer said Friday that he will not sign the nation's strictest 
state anti-abortion bill but he said that he may allow it to become law without 
his signature. 
</P>
<P>
"I've gone from three options to two. 
</P>
<P>
I will either veto the bill or allow it to become law without my signature," 
Roemer said in a statement. He has until July 29 to decide. 
</P>
<P>
Although the bill provides exceptions for pregnancies resulting from rape and 
incest, Roemer said he was not happy with provisions of the legislation and the 
way the Legislature passed it during the closing days of its session. 
</P>
<P>
Roemer, who originally requested a 30-day period in which a woman would be 
allowed to report a rape and have an abortion later, said he was not happy with 
the bill's seven-day provision. 
</P>
<P>
He said also that he believed the bill did not do enough to protect a woman's 
mental health. 
</P>
<P>
The bill calls for up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $100,000 for 
doctors who perform illegal abortions. 
</P>
<P>
Roemer vetoed a measure that allowed exceptions only to protect the life of a 
mother. The Legislature hastily assembled and passed the measure that Roemer 
now says he will not sign. 
</P>
<P>
The governor, abortion rights advocates and some lawmakers have expressed 
doubts about whether the bill is constitutional.

WAS PRESSURED TO TESTIFY, WITNESS AGAINST BARRY SAYS

A witness at the trial of Washington Mayor Marion Barry said Friday that he was 
testifying under "intense pressure" from the government and that his 
recollections of the timing of cocaine use with the mayor were heavily 
influenced by the FBI and prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Sabbs, appearing for a second day in Barry's cocaine and perjury case, 
testified that he had changed his story four times about what year he said he 
had snorted cocaine with Barry in the back room of a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Sabbs, a Barry friend reluctantly testifying for the prosecution, said that he 
had used cocaine with Barry five times between 1986 through 1989. But he said 
also that he has great difficulty remembering the years of the alleged use. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Sabbs said, he cannot even recall when he moved away from Washington. 
He previously told a grand jury that he thought it was around 1979. He now 
thinks it was 1984. 
</P>
<P>
He is "under intense pressure by the government to testify," Sabbs told the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
Barry attorney R. Kenneth Mundy suggested to Sabbs that he had been told by the 
FBI regarding certain details of his alleged cocaine use with the mayor: "It 
had to be this way." 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," Sabbs replied. 
</P>
<P>
"That happened repeatedly," Mundy said. 
</P>
<P>
Mundy's questioning of Sabbs reflected the overall defense strategy of putting 
the government's conduct on trial, trying to show that witnesses were 
improperly coached by overzealous FBI agents out to get Barry and that the 
witnesses were pressured to cut deals to avoid facing drug charges themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The flamboyant Barry, one of the country's best known black politicians, is on 
trial for 14 criminal charges of cocaine possession and perjury. 
</P>
<P>
Mundy said Friday that Barry is "champing at the bit" to testify in his own 
defense but that no decision has been made on whether he will do so.

HALT BUSH'S TILT TO LEFT, CONSERVATIVES TELL GOP; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: FIVE LEADERS FROM THE PARTY'S RIGHT DELIVER A BLAST AT THE PRESIDENT 
FOR AGREEING TO A TAX HIKE AND FOR HIS STANDS ON FOREIGN, SOCIAL ISSUES.

<P>
Five conservative leaders Friday accused President Bush of breaking his word to 
the American people on foreign, social and economic issues, notably by agreeing 
to a tax hike. They called on the Republican Party "to take a stand" against 
Bush's "steady turn to the political left." 
</P>
<P>
This blast from the right is the latest development in what is turning into a 
long, hot summer of political discontent for the Bush Administration. For the 
first time since the 1988 election, the GOP finds itself on the defensive 
against Democrats, who are mounting an aggressive challenge to Bush's handling 
of the savings and loan scandal. 
</P>
<P>
And the public complaint by the five conservative activists, issued in the form 
of a letter to Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater, followed on the heels 
of another attack on the tax hike decision -- a scathing critique of Bush's 
controversial move in the latest issue of National Review, the influential 
conservative periodical. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing here at a joint press conference, the five conservatives -- L. Brent 
Bozell III, director of the Conservative Victory Committee; John Cregan, 
president of the U.S. Business and Industrial Council; David A. Keene, chairman 
of the American Conservative Union; Howard Phillips, chairman of the 
Conservative Caucus, and Richard A. Viguerie, president of United Conservatives 
of America -- spoke more in sorrow than anger. 
</P>
<P>
They did not directly threaten Bush with a challenge to his expected bid for 
renomination in 1992, although Phillips warned that such an effort is likely if 
Bush does not shift his course. But their more fundamental concern, said Keene, 
is that the President "would weaken himself so much politically that he won't 
be able to win no matter what we do." 
</P>
<P>
Bush's actions, Keene contended, amount "not only to bad policies but also dumb 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the tax hike issue, which was the focal point of their 
unhappiness, the conservatives' bill of complaint criticized Bush for lifting 
economic sanctions against China; seeking to ease trade restrictions against 
the Soviet Union; supporting funding for the National Endowment of the Arts, 
despite its sponsorship of allegedly pornographic work, and for considering 
support for new federal regulations in such areas as child and health care, the 
environment and campaign reform. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Goodman, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, refused to 
comment on the letter from the conservatives because she said party officials 
had not had time to read it. 
</P>
<P>
As an example of action conservatives hope Republicans will take to counter the 
President, Cregan of the Business and Industrial Council cited a resolution now 
before the House Republican Conference, which consists of all 176 GOP House 
members. The resolution would put them on record as opposing any new taxes or 
tax rate increases. The conference is expected to vote on the resolution 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Release of the letter to Atwater was timed to coincide with the meeting of the 
Republican National Committee in Chicago, where party leaders seemed mainly 
concerned with responding to the offensive on the savings and loan fiasco 
launched two weeks ago by Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Brown linked the growing cost of the savings and loan bailout to Bush's 
willingness to accept an increase in taxes. "We have found the one cause for 
which George Bush is willing to break his 'no new taxes' pledge," Brown said, 
"the bankers and speculators who ran the savings and loan industry into the 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the only orchestrated attack they've had in nearly two years," 
said Mary Matalin, Republican National Committee chief of staff, of the 
Democratic attack. "But this is not an issue the voters will believe them on." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, speakers at the national committee meeting in Chicago made sure 
that they provided plenty of reassurance for the party faithful on the 
controversial tax cut. In remarks Thursday, explaining Bush's decision, 
presidential pollster Robert Teeter argued that "a good economy is good 
politics" and contended that reducing the budget deficit, as Bush intends, is 
the surest way to guard the economy's health. 
</P>
<P>
Similar words of comfort were spoken Friday by Vice President Dan Quayle, who 
told a luncheon session in Chicago that "the President is willing to go the 
extra mile in seeking to forge a budget agreement that would be good for 
America." But Quayle added: "Let me assure you of this, this President will 
insist on a good deal -- one that is good for our economy and good for our 
country. His position is simple -- a good deal or no deal at all." 
</P>
<P>
A much bleaker view of the prospects for Bush's economic policies is expressed 
in an article in the July 23 National Review written by Paul Craig Roberts, 
former assistant secretary of the Treasury in the Ronald Reagan Administration 
and a militant advocate of supply-side economics. Entitled "Bringing Down the 
House That Reagan Built," Roberts' article contends that Bush has "destroyed 
his credibility . . . split the Republican Party and made the Democrats' day." 
</P>
<P>
Two accompanying articles warn that a tax increase "could do significant 
long-term damage to the Republican Party" and charge that Bush's tax shift was 
based on "the shaky assumptions that a) the deficit really is out of control 
and b) the Democrats are serious about reducing it."

Evan Mecham may run for governor again this fall despite being impeached and 
removed from the office in 1988, Arizona's Supreme Court ruled in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Voters, not the courts, should decide whether the former governor is worthy of 
holding public office again, the high court ruled in unanimously rejecting a 
challenge to Mecham's comeback bid. "Impeachment, essentially a political 
process, is not subject to judicial review," the justices said. Mecham is one 
of five candidates seeking the Republican nomination in the Sept. 11 primary.

JUDGE TELLS STATE TO RELEASE WELFARE FUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
BUDGET: LEGISLATIVE DEADLOCK CONTINUES WITH NO END IN SIGHT. PAYROLL MISSED FOR 
SOME STATE WORKERS.

<P>
A federal judge, saying he was sparing thousands of welfare recipients from 
"great and irreparable harm," ordered the state Friday to continue funding 
welfare programs while the Legislature resolves a budget stalemate that has 
paralyzed state spending since July 1. 
</P>
<P>
Acting on a request by a coalition of welfare rights groups, U.S. District 
Judge Edward J. Garcia issued a temporary restraining order in Sacramento that 
prohibits the state from holding up $149 million in welfare benefits, mainly to 
single mothers and their children. 
</P>
<P>
Had Garcia not issued the order, federal and state funds would have been 
withheld from the state's 58 counties, whose agencies distribute family aid to 
1.9 million Californians. 
</P>
<P>
Most counties, including those in Southern California, had been prepared to 
draw on their own funds to meet welfare obligations at least temporarily. But 
five rural counties with about 50,000 welfare recipients -- Tulare, Siskiyou, 
Mendocino, Mariposa and Yuba -- had announced that unless the state released 
the funds, they could not afford to mail out benefit checks. 
</P>
<P>
State Controller Gray Davis had said earlier that as long as the state was 
without a 1990-91 budget, his office was prohibited by law from releasing 
welfare funds. After the court ruling, a spokesman said Davis' office would 
immediately wire the funds to the counties, and that people would receive 
welfare checks today or Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, thank God!" exclaimed Stephanie Pratt, an unemployed Tulare County 
resident who is expecting a baby in August and depends on $225-per-month from 
the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Pratt feared that if she 
didn't receive her mid-month check, she would be homeless by the time the baby 
arrived. "I won't get kicked out of my house after all. I'm so glad to hear 
that!" she said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Although checks will be going out to welfare recipients, the state Friday 
missed a $6-million payroll for about 4,800 California Department of 
Transportation workers, and a $2.6-million payroll for 2,600 employees of the 
Legislature. Most state employees are paid only once a month, so they are not 
due to be paid until the end of July. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't heard too many complaints from the men yet," said Charles Wheeler, a 
Caltrans highways maintenance supervisor in Sacramento. "I have heard some 
grumbling. The people who live from paycheck to paycheck are going to be hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Kristen Rutter, a receptionist for the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, said: 
"I am one of the lucky ones. I have a little bit of money in savings. I'll have 
to dip into my savings." 
</P>
<P>
The developments prompted Davis to ask the Legislature for a bill that would 
authorize him to continue making payments for essential services as the budget 
impasse drags on. As of late Friday, the state was holding up $1.2 billion in 
payments to doctors, hospitals and nursing home operators involved in Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of these missed payments are for local government and providers of 
services to the most vulnerable and needy members of our population. They 
should not be forced to bear the financial brunt of philosophical budgetary 
differences," Davis said in the letter to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco) and Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
Garcia's order to release the welfare funds came in response to a suit filed 
Thursday by a coalition of welfare rights groups. Attorneys for Legal Services 
of Northern California and the Western Center on Law and Poverty charged the 
state with violating federal law by refusing to release state and federal 
welfare funds to the counties until the Legislature enacts a budget. 
</P>
<P>
At Friday's hearing, the welfare rights attorneys argued that the Social 
Security Act, which requires that payments be made "without delay" and 
"continued regularly," takes precedence over the state Constitution, which 
requires legislative authorization before the state can spend money. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Atty. Gen. Barbara Haukedalen replied that the suit was premature 
because it was only "speculation" that some welfare recipients would not 
receive their benefit checks because of the budget deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
Garcia said he believed "that great and irreparable harm would be suffered by 
welfare recipients if they don't get the money they're entitled to as soon as 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Haukedalen said that she would immediately seek an emergency stay of 
the restraining order from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San 
Francisco. The appeals court was not expected to act on the motion before the 
welfare checks are mailed out. 
</P>
<P>
A key legislator said the court ruling will relieve pressure on Democratic 
lawmakers to give in to Gov. George Deukmejian in the ongoing struggle to shape 
a state budget. 
</P>
<P>
"Substantially, it's correct, and politically it's a plus, too," said 
Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara), chairman of the Ways and Means 
Committee. "The million poor kids aren't being held hostage anymore." 
</P>
<P>
In the Legislature, a two-house budget conference committee spent much of the 
day negotiating individual budget reductions. The painstaking work produced 
firm agreements on about $1 billion in cuts, but the amount is still well below 
the $1.7 billion that Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have agreed to 
eliminate from the budget. 
</P>
<P>
The basic conflict, as it has been for six weeks, is whether the state will 
close a $3.6-billion revenue gap through a series of budget reductions, as 
Deukmejian is insisting, or through a combination of budget cuts and tax 
increases, which Democrats are bargaining for. 
</P>
<P>
Vasconcellos, chairman of the conference committee, said he wants a 50-50 split 
between tax increases and budget cuts, meaning that spending rollbacks and tax 
hikes would each total about $1.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Republicans on the committee have balked. "If you are looking for a 50-50 
solution, it isn't going to occur," said Assemblyman William P. Baker 
(R-Danville). 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly-Senate conference committee on taxes is scheduled to meet today 
and Monday in an effort to hammer out a bipartisan agreement.

More than 72,000 babies are born in California each year with prenatal exposure 
to harmful drugs and alcohol, but only about 11% of them are in county 
programs, state researchers announced. The Senate Office of Research said 25 of 
the state's 58 counties reported that 6,358 drug-exposed newborns were referred 
to county child welfare services in the 1988-89 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
The counties account for 80% of the state's births. Only 11% of the estimated 
72,000 babies who were exposed to drugs in the womb are being referred to Child 
Protective Services units, the report found. Ninety-one percent of the counties 
responding to the survey said cocaine was the drug detected most often in 
screening tests of high-risk mothers or babies. "Counties are reporting an 
alarming lack of drug treatment programs for substance-abusing pregnant women 
and new mothers, posing untold risks for thousands of babies," said Sen. Diane 
Watson, the Los Angeles Democrat who requested the survey.

8,000 JOBS MAY BE LOST TO SAVE OWL

Reconsidering the extent of its decision earlier this week, the state 
Department of Forestry said as many as 8,000 jobs may be lost when it expands 
protection of spotted-owl habitat to private lands. 
</P>
<P>
The rules, similar to those regulating national forests, originally were 
expected to cost no more than 1,900 jobs. The rules forbid logging that damages 
owl nests or reduces owl habitat. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recently 
declared the northern spotted owl, which lives in valuable old-growth forests, 
to be threatened with extinction because of heavy logging. This forced the 
state to take measures to protect the bird.

Anti-marijuana activists could not find enough Berkeley voters to just say yes 
to a "Just Say No" ballot measure aimed at forcing police to vigorously enforce 
drug laws. The activists were trying to put a measure on the November ballot to 
rescind a 1979 plebiscite that forced police to make enforcement of marijuana 
laws their lowest priority. City officials of this liberal college town of 
106,000 residents said that the anti-drug petition fell 222 votes shy of the 
2,304 needed to qualify it for the ballot.

SULLIVAN PRAISES TROUBLED LEARNFARE

<P>
The nation's top welfare official on Friday commended a Wisconsin experiment 
tying welfare benefits to school attendance but cautioned officials to resolve 
the program's administrative problems. 
</P>
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said his office would 
continue to monitor the Learnfare program for improvement but had already found 
the program's goals "quite laudable." 
</P>
<P>
Learnfare, started in 1987, trims Aid to Families With Dependent Children 
benefits to families whose teen-agers skip school. It has been touted as an 
incentive for teen-agers to continue their education and chances of employment, 
but has been harshly criticized by welfare advocates. 
</P>
<P>
The program was ordered suspended in Milwaukee schools this week by U.S. 
District Judge Terence Evans, who cited poor record-keeping that resulted in 
some families being wrongly penalized. 
</P>
<P>
Evans' injunction applies only to the 3,200 teen-agers attending Milwaukee 
public schools who have lost or are in danger of losing welfare benefits under 
Learnfare. The program continues in other parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
Sullivan, who was in Marshfield to dedicate a new $6.1-million research center 
at Marshfield Clinic, said he was not concerned by the judge's action. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, with any program that is new, there are always a number of glitches 
or problems that might need to be addressed," he said.

FREEWAY MAY BE CLOSED FOR MONDAY COMMUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II and VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The three-mile section of the Hollywood Freeway that was closed Friday because 
of the subway tunnel fire will not be reopened this weekend and might not be 
open for the Monday morning commute, California Highway Patrol officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A 150-foot section of the roof over the stricken tunnel collapsed to within 10 
feet of the freeway, and officials are concerned that heat from the fire might 
have weakened the 18- to 20-foot-thick wall of soil directly between the tunnel 
and the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Baxter, head of the state Department of Transportation district 
encompassing Los Angeles, said the agency would not be able to make any 
decisions about reopening the freeway until civil engineers were able to enter 
the tunnel and assess the strength of the soil above it. The fire directly 
under the freeway was extinguished Friday afternoon, but engineers were driven 
back by the heat when they attempted to enter the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
According to Los Angeles Fire Marshal Dave Parsons, engineers were planning to 
enter the tunnel Friday evening, if it had cooled sufficiently, to begin 
shoring it up with a timber frame. By mid-evening, however, the tunnel was 
still too hot for a thorough inspection. 
</P>
<P>
If the freeway segment remains closed Monday or later, it is expected to create 
problems for commuters because the route, U.S. 101, is the main artery linking 
downtown Los Angeles to Hollywood, the San Fernando Valley and Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
The El Monte busway that runs adjacent to the Hollywood Freeway in that section 
will most likely be reopened by Monday, according to Dave Roper, deputy 
district director of Caltrans. The busway is 50 feet above the ground and 
officials are not particularly worried about its structural integrity. 
</P>
<P>
They did not reopen it immediately, however, because they feared that 
vibrations from traffic would be transmitted through the soil and cause more of 
the tunnel to collapse. It will not be reopened, Roper said, until the tunnel 
is shored up with timber. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers reported being concerned about the safety of the freeway because it 
is not built on bedrock in that area. Rather, it is supported by compacted 
earth and sand that have been injected with cement-like grouting for bonding. 
The bonded material is not as strong as either concrete or rock, and engineers 
feared that the bonding may have been weakened by the intense heat from the 
flames. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures inside the tunnel reached about 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel roof that collapsed had not been reinforced with grouting because 
there were no structures above it. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers took some of the bonded material -- from a section that had not been 
affected by heat -- to a laboratory where they planned to heat it and measure 
the loss of strength, if any. If that test shows little effect from the heat, 
Caltrans officials expressed more confidence about reopening the freeway 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Civil engineer Ed Kavazanjian of Earth Technologies Inc. in Los Angeles said 
that engineers have had little experience with the effects of heat on the 
grouting, but that "most likely" it would not be damaged by the heat. 
</P>
<P>
But the reopening date will not be determined, experts said, until engineers 
can get inside and inspect the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
Once inside, they will be looking for any evidence of settling, which would be 
an immediate indication that the safety of the freeway is threatened. If no 
visible evidence of danger appears, they are expected to bore holes into the 
compacted material to assess its strength and to remove samples for testing. 
</P>
<P>
The freeway itself is almost certainly not damaged, officials said, because of 
the insulating properties of the soil between it and the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>

CONTRACTOR CALLS BLAZE A 'TREMENDOUS DISASTER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ronald N. Tutor, the hard-driving, outspoken boss of the Metro Rail's largest 
contractor, called the fire that raged through the $35-million tunnel that his 
crews were building a "tremendous disaster." 
</P>
<P>
But he quickly added that the tunnel fire is "one isolated tragedy" in upward 
of $2 billion in public works contracts completed by his company. Isolated 
though the fire may be, the Sylmar-based Tutor-Saliba Corp. and its boss have 
made their share of waves in a notoriously tough business. 
</P>
<P>
Tutor and his firm have been enmeshed in scores of suits over the years. 
Tutor-Saliba has been cited nearly 300 times for safety violations by Cal/OSHA 
since 1979. A spokesman for the state's occupational safety and health agency 
said 9.3% were considered serious, and a "very low" number of willful 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
The federal Occupation Safety and Health Administration also has cited the 
firm. But in two inspections last year of the tunnel that smolders today, OSHA 
apparently found no violations, said Marsha Grueber, director of OSHA in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Tutor-Saliba, one of the largest contractors in California, has won many 
lucrative and high-profile government contracts. Its jobs include a 
$180-million piece of the New York subway renovation and part of the 
$58-million overhaul of the San Francisco cable-car system. 
</P>
<P>
The firm also was one of the lead contractors in the construction of the Tom 
Bradley International Terminal at Los Angeles International Airport, the San 
Diego Convention Center and the widening of the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
It found one of its biggest projects in the Metro Rail. Out of about 20 general 
contractors working on the $1.4-billion Metro Rail, Tutor-Saliba has the 
largest number of contracts -- five -- and its share is the richest -- $207.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
RTD spokesman Greg Davy said if the investigation proves that the contractor 
was at fault, "he'll probably have to eat" the costs associated with the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
Tutor refused to discuss his theory about the cause of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
In three of its separate Metro Rail contractors, Tutor-Saliba is involved in 
joint ventures with Perini Corp., a Framingham, Mass., firm that is the 
25th-largest contractor in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Perini is the main contractor on the renovation of the New York City subway 
system. On $180 million worth of work, Tutor-Saliba is a partner. In November, 
workers from the firms left debris on tracks, causing a small explosion that 
shorted out a rail and resulted in major delays along the Lexington line. 
</P>
<P>
Perini also is a target of a suit by the New York attorney general over the 
1987 collapse of a New York State Thruway bridge that killed 10 people.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
FOR FIREFIGHTERS, IT WAS 'LIKE WALKING INTO HELL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The blistering heat inside the Metro Rail tunnel was intense -- even to veteran 
Los Angeles firefighters accustomed to such dangers. Donning hard hats, 
fireproof gear, masks and oxygen tanks, four-man teams of firefighters went in 
for a only brief stay before giving way to another squad. 
</P>
<P>
As they emerged, they spoke of the hardships of fighting a fire underground. 
</P>
<P>
"If hell was like this, I think I would go to church more often," said 
firefighter-paramedic John Gonzalez of the Studio City station. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighter Al Gear, who spread fire-retardant foam on the flames, said: "You 
know when you put your turkey in the oven for Thanksgiving? Imagine being in 
there with it." 
</P>
<P>
Drenched with perspiration, Fire Capt. Richard Borowski said there was no wood 
left and that circular steel beams lining the tunnel were bending under the 
intense heat. 
</P>
<P>
"I bet I lost a lot of weight," he said. "(This fire is) one of the hardest 
ones that I have been in in 16 years. It's scary when you're inside and embers 
are falling all around." 
</P>
<P>
Chief Dean Cathey, head of planning for the Fire Department, said that battling 
the tunnel fire had proved extremely difficult and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
"You have one way in and one way out. It is like walking into hell. It is that 
hot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters, Metro Rail workers and commuters were not the only ones affected 
by the blaze. Gas pipelines to a number of nearby businesses were temporarily 
shut off, as was a pipeline to the Metropolitan Detention Center. 
</P>
<P>
But the prisoners may only have noticed it at mealtime. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has gone on as scheduled. Ordinarily we use the gas for the oven 
and the dishwashers," said Gary Katsel, associate warden of the Metropolitan 
Detention Center. "But today we used paper plates and a microwave. Things are 
pretty much routine." 
</P>
<P>
Two evacuation signs were posted at Piper Technical Center on the doors of the 
City of Los Angeles' Department of General Services. One handwritten sign on 
the second floor door window said: "The building has been evacuated! Go Home!" 
</P>
<P>
The other handwritten sign was on the third floor. 
</P>
<P>
Scrawled on paper, it read: "Summer Workers -- No Work Today."

CHAIN REACTION OF COLLEGE EXPANSION EVENTS SWEEPING NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN MURRAY, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some administrators look at the state of college athletics -- at the deficit 
spending, the spiraling costs, the rampant uncertainty -- and see chaos. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Lengyel, athletic director at Navy, looks at all of the above and sees a 
glass that is half-filled with opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"What better time than now?" Lengyel asked. "When you look around at the 
possibility for change, it's a great time, a great opportunity to make 
effective and important decisions about athletics. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take great leadership. But things are not as bad as (the skeptics) 
paint it." 
</P>
<P>
Change is just around the corner for college athletics. As administrators 
across the country wrestle with grim financial reports, the search for 
solutions has brought us to the dawning of the age of the super conference, if 
you believe recent speculation. By the year 2001, you could expect to see the 
following headlines in college football: 
</P>
<P>
Penn State dumps Nebraska in divisional playoff for Big Ten title 
</P>
<P>
Boston College outlasts South Carolina to win ACC playoff 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame, Florida State advance to Division I championship game 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2001, you could see five "super conferences" composed of 12 to 16 
schools, with each conference negotiating its own network TV contract. You 
could see a national playoff that would retain, to some degree, the bowl 
system. You could see the National Collegiate Athletic Association 
administering its rules and regulations to schools in Divisions II and III 
only. 
</P>
<P>
Call it the Big Bang. It already has started. 
</P>
<P>
The first cataclysmic blast was heard last December, when Penn State gave up 
independent status in football to join the Big Ten Conference. The next was 
heard in February, when Notre Dame bolted from the College Football 
Association's five-year television package and negotiated its own TV deal. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, a chain reaction of expansion events has swept across the land. The 
Southeastern Conference formally invited Florida State, Miami and Arkansas to 
climb aboard. The once-formidable Southwest Conference, with only two major TV 
markets, quickly huddled with the Big Eight Conference to talk about 
consolidation. The Metro Conference wants to add football to its other sports 
schedules. And the Atlantic Coast Conference, after voting not to expand, had 
to rethink its stance as the SEC tried to move into its territory. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of all this discussion is economics, particularly as it relates to 
football. In an attempt to become self-sufficient, athletic departments have 
had to find new ways of coming up with revenue. The bottom line on college 
athletic budgets has been written in red. 
</P>
<P>
"It goes back to the perception that intercollegiate programs are fat, and 
that's not true," said Lew Perkins, outgoing athletic director of the 
University of Maryland. "Michigan lost $2.5 million, Stanford had to cut back 
30 track scholarships. The cost of doing business is getting out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
The problem at Maryland has been even more acute. While trying to bring the 
budget in line, Perkins' successor will have to deal with the loss of some $3 
million because of recent NCAA basketball sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent College Football Association financial survey shows that the 
cost of running a major college program has gone up 34 percent the last four 
years, while income is up only 21 percent. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Tarman, athletic director at Penn State, played down the financial 
implications of the move to the Big Ten, yet admitted that it was a hedge 
against the future. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep reading we did it for money," Tarman said. "I'm not sure we'll be 
further ahead financially. Our feeling was, maybe it's best for us in the 
decade ahead, and the next century, to be part of a group that will get into 
revenue-sharing. Who knows what the future holds? This is a built-in assurance 
(of solvency)." 
</P>
<P>
All football independents, including Navy, watched the historic Penn State move 
closely because it could be the start of a trend. 
</P>
<P>
"If everybody goes to a conference, we have to be concerned where we fit," 
Lengyel said. "We've attempted to talk to all the conferences so we're aware of 
what's happening. We want to be able to make an intelligent decision, not a 
crisis decision. If the CFA goes down and there's no consortium for revenues, 
we might have to look at a conference." 
</P>
<P>
The health -- and wealth -- of the CFA is another part of the equation. The 
Federal Trade Commission is investigating antitrust claims against the CFA's 
network TV contracts. If the CFA package is ruled in violation of antitrust 
law, five major conferences (ACC, SEC, SWC, Big Eight, Western Athletic 
Conference) could be without a national TV deal. 
</P>
<P>
The CFA is heading into the fourth and final year of a $134 million contract 
with CBS and ESPN. The new contract, with ABC and ESPN, begins in 1991 and is 
worth $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
The CFA was formed in 1983 when 63 big-time programs decided to break from the 
NCAA's TV package. At that point, the Big Ten and Pac-10 started negotiating 
their own TV deal. 
</P>
<P>
Of the rampant speculation about super conferences, CFA Executive Director 
Chuck Neinas said, "It's economically driven. I think television has served as 
a smoke screen for other economic issues. I think there are some cases where 
some institutions are trying to get a change in their conference financial 
structure." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Haines, executive vice president for Raycom Sports in Charlotte, N.C., is 
among those who expect a new look for college athletics. The Metro Conference 
asked Raycom last January to conduct a feasibility study on expansion. The two 
proposals selected by the league were for a 16-team football conference and a 
12-team all-sports conference. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-school super conference would be comprised of the eight Metro schools; 
Big East schools Syracuse, Pitt and Boston College; Atlantic 10 schools West 
Virginia, Rutgers and Temple; and independents Miami and East Carolina. Four 
schools -- Syracuse, Boston College, Pitt and East Carolina -- are not 
interested in an all-sports conference. Miami, meanwhile, said it is interested 
only in an all-sports affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
"There is interest in it," Haines said of the Metro's super conference plan. 
"Whether or not some southern schools are able to over come the attractiveness 
of the ACC or SEC remains to be seen. The super conference makes a lot of 
sense, looking at the future. You're talking about TV households that measure 
between 35 and 40 percent of the country. There are a lot of reasons why it 
ought to take place. We expect to know in 30 days." 
</P>
<P>
Not everybody agrees with the concept, though. Bruce Skinner, former executive 
director for the Fiesta Bowl, does not think the idea will fly once 
administrators look at it more closely. 
</P>
<P>
If a super conference is formed, somebody's got to go 1-10," Skinner said. "And 
if you have a bunch of (traditional) 10-1 teams, somebody's got to go 6-5, and 
that will lessen attendance. For financial reasons, it won't happen."

HOLTZ MAKES WEST PAY PRICE FOR PENALTIES

<P>
Eric Holtz of Simi Valley said it was mere coincidence that, on his birthday, 
he scored three times to account for the South's only goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Right. 
</P>
<P>
 The South got four opportunities to score on penalty shots in the last minutes 
of its 3-2 victory over the West on Friday in U. S. Olympic Festival field 
hockey action at Augsburg College's Nelson Anderson Field. 
</P>
<P>
Guess who attempted them all? 
</P>
<P>
What a coincidence! 
</P>
<P>
The last one, from 10 yards, came with 10 seconds left in the game and eluded 
West goalie Robbie Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
With that, the celebration was on. Holtz first was mobbed by teammates, then 
presented with a birthday cake. 
</P>
<P>
There was plenty to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
The South, composed of 15 members of the U. S. national team -- including nine 
from the Valley area -- finished round-robin play with a 5-1 record. It will 
face the East (4-1-1) in the gold-medal game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The West, which is 1-3-2 and will play for a bronze medal, scored its only two 
goals in the game's first 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Sammy Hoang of Westlake Village scored 11 minutes into the game and, two 
minutes later, younger brother Binh duplicated the feat. 
</P>
<P>
Each of Holtz's goals came off a penalty corner, which is essentially a free 
shot on goal from any place more than 10 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TABLE TENNIS 
</P>
<P>
The team of Lan Vuong of Reseda and Scott Butler of Iowa City, Iowa, lost in 
the gold-medal match of the mixed doubles competition, falling to Sean O'Neill 
of McLean, Va., and Li Ai of Colorado Springs, Colo., 9-21, 21-18, 21-18. But 
Vuong and Butler captured the silver medal for their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Butler of Iowa City and Carol Davidson of North Hollywood fell in the 
quarterfinals, losing to Brandon Olson of Hopkins, Minn., and Takako Trenholme 
of Minneapolis, 21-17, 21-14. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
<P>
Gold is the goal for Coley Kyman and Ken Lynch, North team members from Cal 
State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The North routed the East, 15-5, 15-11, 15-10 at Williams Arena on Friday to 
clinch a spot in Sunday's gold-medal game. 
</P>
<P>
Kyman, from Reseda, and Lynch, from Malibu, had nine and three kills, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's Duncan Blackman led the North with 16 kills and a .461 hitting 
percentage, same as Kyman's. 
</P>
<P>
The South, led by John Ross of Canoga Park, also advanced to the championship 
match with a 9-15, 15-4, 11-15, 15-7, 15-12 win over the West. Ross has 16 
kills, eight digs, eight block assists and a .500 attacking percentage. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Reznick of Cal State Northridge had 62 assists and a match-high 12 digs 
for the West. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TRACK 
</P>
<P>
Percy Knox is best known as a long jumper, but he earned a silver medal as a 
sprinter in the 4 X 100-meter relay. 
</P>
<P>
Knox, from Lancaster, teamed with Mark Olivier of Mesa, Ariz., Bryan 
Bridgewater of Los Angeles and Jeff Williams of Montrose to place second with a 
time of 38.83. 
</P>
<P>
The South team of Henry Neal (Dallas), Lee McNeill (Lumberton, N.C.), Antonio 
Smith (Wichita, Kan.) and Kenny Brokenburr (Winterhaven, Fla.) won the race in 
38.79. 
</P>
<P>
In women's competition, Victoria Herazo of Newhall was fourth in the 
10-kilometer walk with a time of 49 minutes, 26.95 seconds. Debbie Lawrence of 
Kenosha, Wis., broke her national record in winning the race in 46:10.26. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TEAM HANDBALL 
</P>
<P>
The West team broke into the win column, 20-16, over the South as Denny Fercho 
of Camarillo scored twice.

FAMILY AFFAIR: WESTLAKE VILLAGE'S HOANG BROTHERS SPARE THE FURNITURE AND TAKE 
SHOTS AT A REAL GOAL IN MINNEAPOLIS.

<TEXT>
<P>
It is painfully obvious to the entire Hoang family when brothers Tommy, Sammy 
and Bihn have been practicing their favorite sport. 
</P>
<P>
A quick check of the furniture around the family's Westlake Village home 
reveals numerous telltale signs. 
</P>
<P>
An additional chip on the grand piano or a scratch on the leg of the coffee 
table is a clue that the boys have been at it again. 
</P>
<P>
They have turned the living room into a hockey surface. 
</P>
<P>
Well, at least they don't slice up the carpet with their skates. The Hoangs do 
not play that type of hockey. 
</P>
<P>
They play field hockey, an infinitely more convenient game that can be played 
just about anywhere -- den, family room and bedrooms included. 
</P>
<P>
A single ball -- a billiard ball will suffice -- and some curved wooden sticks 
are the only necessities. 
</P>
<P>
During informal sessions, what constitutes the goal is left up to the 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
"We like the sofa," Sammy said. "It bounces back." 
</P>
<P>
Which distinguishes it from the windows. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time my dad sees a broken window he says it reminds him of us," Tommy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Such is life in a household full of athletes. The Hoangs, and their furniture, 
certainly aren't the only ones who suffer periodically from battle scars. 
</P>
<P>
There are nine other combinations of brothers competing at the Festival, 
including five in field hockey. 
</P>
<P>
And imagine the mess if brothers Rob and Doug Stull, competitors in the modern 
pentathlon, ever decided to practice around the house. 
</P>
<P>
The swimming and running parts doubt would be acceptable. Maybe even the 
fencing and horse jumping. 
</P>
<P>
But the shooting? 
</P>
<P>
In all, there are 52 athletes and coaches forming 25 different family 
combinations at the Festival. 
</P>
<P>
The Hoangs form the front line for the West field hockey squad, with Tommy, 23, 
at center, Sammy, 20, to his right and Binh, 16, to his left. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy won a bronze medal as a member of the U. S. team in the 1987 Pan American 
Games, although he is best remembered for the ordeal he experienced in 
qualifying for the squad. 
</P>
<P>
A very important prerequisite for making an American team, Hoang learned, was 
to be an American. He was not. 
</P>
<P>
Although his family left its native Vietnam in 1975, Tommy didn't become a 
citizen until midway through the Olympic Festival three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
He flew to North Carolina to take part in practice, flew back to Los Angeles to 
take his oath of citizenship, then returned to the Festival in time to play in 
his team's medal game. 
</P>
<P>
This is the third Festival for Tommy and Sammy; Binh, a wrestler and football 
player at Westlake High, is making his debut. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Sammy and Binh each scored his first goal of the competition. Tommy 
scored twice earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
And just as always Tommy led, Sammy came in second and Binh followed -- they 
scored in the same order they took up the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"Once I picked up a stick, they picked up a stick," Tommy said. "We compete 
against each other in everything we do -- Nintendo games, any sport." 
</P>
<P>
And just because they are members of the same Festival team doesn't mean the 
Hoangs have stopped needling each other. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's 'Who is going to be the leading scorer of the tournament?' " Tommy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Field hockey has numerous followers in the Conejo Valley, where the Hoangs 
live, but the brothers' best playing partners are each other. 
</P>
<P>
"The only time we practice is when we practice together," Tommy said. 
</P>
<P>
The condition of the family's furnishings is proof positive.

NCAA CHAMPION MCBRIDE WANTS TO LEAVE CSUN FOR UC IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Erick McBride of Cal State Northridge, who won the men's 800-meter run at the 
NCAA Division II championships in May, said Friday that he will transfer to UC 
Irvine in January. 
</P>
<P>
McBride, who set a school record of 1 minute 49.09 seconds in the 800 as a 
freshman last season, would not say why he wanted to transfer, but said that 
the resignation of Northridge assistant coach Bob Augello last month had a 
bearing on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I had thought about transferring before (Augello resigned)," McBride said. 
"But now that he's gone, it has a huge effect on my decision." 
</P>
<P>
Augello, an assistant with the Northridge men's and women's cross-country and 
track teams the past two years, became an assistant coach of the Subaru Cycling 
Team. 
</P>
<P>
McBride wanted to transfer to Irvine in the fall but failed to meet some of the 
academic requirements at the Big West Conference school. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, I just have to get my grades up in the next semester," he said. "I 
didn't do real well in a couple of classes last semester." 
</P>
<P>
Don Strametz, the Northridge men's and women's cross-country and track coach, 
would not comment on McBride's transfer, but he expressed doubt that McBride 
would have enough academic units to transfer to a University of California 
branch within a year. 
</P>
<P>
McBride said he will run for Northridge during the cross-country season and, 
provided he raises his grades sufficiently, will enroll at Irvine for the 
winter quarter in January. 
</P>
<P>
According to NCAA rules, McBride would have to sit out the 1991 track and 
cross-country seasons before resuming collegiate competition in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
He will run for the Santa Monica Track Club during that period and would have 
three seasons of eligibility in track and two seasons in cross-country 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I just have a lot of personal reasons for transferring," McBride said. "I'd 
rather not say what they are because I don't want to offend anyone or make any 
enemies." 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Southern Section 4-A Division champion in the 800 as a Palmdale High 
senior, McBride struggled early last season before peaking in May.

MINOR LEAGUE REPORT; 
</P>
<P>
BROTHERS TATUM BACK TOGETHER WITH BREWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LINDGREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The baseball careers of Jim and John Tatum are now harbored in the same port, 
but the tides that brought them there came from much different directions. 
</P>
<P>
Jim was the player of the year at Santana in 1984 while leading the Sultans to 
the 3-A title. 
</P>
<P>
John was a finalist for the same award at Grossmont while helping the 
Foothillers win the 2-A title in May. 
</P>
<P>
With regards to Crawford's Bob and Ray Boone and Hoover's Mike and Mark Davis, 
the Tatums might be the finest baseball brothers in San Diego Section history. 
</P>
<P>
Today, they find themselves playing minor league ball for the same organization 
-- the Milwaukee Brewers -- at the same position -- third base. 
</P>
<P>
Jim, 22, is hitting .278 with six home runs and 23 RBIs in 21 games for the 
Stockton Ports, a Class A team. John, who will turn 18 next Friday, is hitting 
.407 with nine RBIs in seven games for Peoria, Ariz., a rookie league club. 
</P>
<P>
And in time? Well, you can only have one third baseman on the field at once. 
</P>
<P>
"If it came down to that," Jim said, "I'd be happy if he made it, or I'd be 
happy if I made it. I'm sure he feels the same way." 
</P>
<P>
At Santana, where he also starred in football (quarterback) and basketball, Jim 
was a notably fierce competitor. 
</P>
<P>
He also could be outspoken and brutally honest at times and quiet, lonely and 
confused at others. Either way, he said, he was mostly misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
Their parents went through a divorce when Jim and John were 13 and 8. Jim said 
it affected him immensely. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't understand why they couldn't work things out," Jim said. "It was 
hard. There wasn't much stability in my life then. I was basically by myself. I 
knew the only thing I could grasp hard was athletics." 
</P>
<P>
In doing so, he left behind quite a legacy when he graduated in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
John, who used to go to all of Jim's games with their father, grew up with the 
"big shoes" and "shadow" syndromes. People reminded him all the time what a 
great athlete Jim was. But John handled it amazingly well. 
</P>
<P>
Moving and attending Grossmont helped. He was not really accepted at Santana, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
"I was compared with my brother all the time," he said. "(But at Grossmont), 
the parents, the players, the coaches, they let me be me. They all took me for 
who I am." 
</P>
<P>
Both Jim and John, feared hitters and pitchers alike in high school, caused 
significant revisions in the section record book. 
</P>
<P>
Jim is the only player in section history to hit four home runs in a game and 
is among four with nine runs batted in in a game. John, who twice hit two 
homers in one game (including two in the same inning), broke the record for 
saves in a single season with 13 and also equaled the career mark. In two 
years, he was 10-0. Both hit 11 home runs their senior years while batting in 
the high .400s. 
</P>
<P>
Similar as their high school careers were, John is hoping his minor league 
years are more fortunate than Jim's. 
</P>
<P>
Jim, after four somewhat successful years in the Padre organization -- he was a 
third-round draft choice in 1985 -- ran into off-field problems during the 
1988-89 off-season. 
</P>
<P>
He was divorced from his high school sweetheart after two years of marriage in 
December, stabbed in the arm by her new boyfriend during a fight on Christmas 
night and accused of vandalizing her car in March (he was arrested but says 
charges were never brought). 
</P>
<P>
The timing of the latter incident -- two days before spring training -- led the 
Padres to suspend Jim and request that he go through a counseling program. 
</P>
<P>
Jim says he tried the program but didn't feel anything was wrong with him and 
didn't understand what the team was trying to do. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt insulted," he said. "I didn't mind talking to those guys. They had some 
great ideas, but then they all started to sound the same." 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't getting paid but says what hurt him most was not being able to play 
baseball. Finally, after sitting out the year, Jim asked for his release, and 
the Padres obliged. 
</P>
<P>
The year off, he said, gave him time to grow, and for the first time, watch 
John play ball. 
</P>
<P>
"To go away for so many years, and then come back, all of a sudden, he was 
dominating. It was really neat," Jim said. 
</P>
<P>
John went 10 for 12 in a playoff drive that ended with a loss to Carlsbad in 
the 1989 2-A championship. 
</P>
<P>
That summer, Jim starred on a National Baseball Congress team. In September, 
1989, he signed with the Indians. He started this year in double-A at 
Canton-Akron (Ohio) but hit just .180 and was soon released. 
</P>
<P>
The Brewers had been interested when he signed with Cleveland, so Jim made some 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
John had been drafted in the 15th round by the Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
Their signing dates were just days apart. 
</P>
<P>
Said John jokingly, "At first, I said, 'Oh my God. I thought I got away from 
him.' 
</P>
<P>
"But then I thought, 'All the better. We can work as a team now.' I looked up 
to him for so long, then I competed (with his legacy) in high school. 
</P>
<P>
"When we talked after we both had signed, he said, 'John, you're not my little 
brother any more. You're my teammate.' I was ecstatic. It made me feel great."

CHARGES FLY OVER AIR TRAVEL SURCHARGES; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: FEES ARE ADDED TO TICKET PRICES FOR EVERYTHING FROM CUSTOMS 
INSPECTIONS AND FUEL TO AIRPORT CONSTRUCTION COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Airline passengers entering the United States may soon have to shell out an 
extra $1 per ticket for the government inspection to prevent illegal food or 
animals from entering the country. They might also have to pay $1 per ticket to 
help operate the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration that lures foreigners 
to this country. 
</P>
<P>
Persons traveling domestically already pay an 8% tax every time they fly, a 
largely invisible levy that Congress is trying to boost by 25%. International 
passengers pay a "departure" tax that, like the 8% domestic fee, goes into the 
Aviation Trust Fund to defray the federal government's costs in handling 
international air traffic. The government also charges a 5% tax on cargo 
shipments. 
</P>
<P>
These are just a few of the actual or proposed surcharges and taxes that 
airline passengers pay before they step on a plane. Travelers are increasingly 
being charged extra for everything from airport construction costs to fuel to 
security inspections. 
</P>
<P>
Airlines defend some of the surcharges as necessary to recoup some of their 
growing operating costs. But they complain about some of the taxes that the 
government orders them to collect. 
</P>
<P>
And passenger groups say the increasing use of surcharges and taxes have become 
excessive. They contend that passengers are often not informed about the fees 
and that if they are, such added charges are put into advertisements in type so 
small that it's not easily noticed. 
</P>
<P>
Some taxes, critics contend, are used by the federal government to lower the 
budget deficit -- not to defray airline travel costs as is the stated purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a deception," says Christopher Witkowski, director of the Ralph 
Nader-founded Aviation Consumer Action Project, which works to improve airline 
safety and passenger rights. "These surcharges misrepresent the cost of air 
travel to the consumer. The airlines don't include the surcharges -- both the 
government ones and the ones that the carriers institute -- in the total 
(advertised) fare." 
</P>
<P>
"The trend over the last three years is that whenever fuel prices go up, in a 
matter of days you will see a modest increase in the price of an airline 
ticket," says Richard Livingston, chairman of the 110,000-member Airline 
Passengers Assn. of North America. "In my business, (when) my prices go up I 
expect my profit margins to be reduced for a time." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy over surcharges was heightened most recently when American 
Airlines -- blaming high charges it paid for construction and other projects at 
five airports, including New York's LaGuardia and Newark International Airport 
-- instituted surcharges of $1 to $4 beginning next week. 
</P>
<P>
If all pending surcharges are imposed, federal taxes and charges will have 
increased from 2% of the average ticket price in 1980 to 14%, according to the 
Air Transport Assn., the airline industry's chief trade group. Likewise, the 
ATA says, international ticket prices will have gone up an average of $51 
during the past decade, with $29 of that to pay for basic government services. 
</P>
<P>
"It's as though you had to pay a law enforcement surcharge every time you drove 
through an intersection at which a police officer was directing traffic," the 
ATA says in a draft report criticizing the growth of surcharges. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most controversial of the charges is the 8% tax. Airlines and 
passenger groups alike are critical of the federal government for diverting the 
tax proceeds from its intended use of upgrading airport and other aviation 
facilities. Instead, they say, much of the money has been put into the general 
fund to help lower the federal budget deficit. There is $7 billion in unused, 
unspent ticket revenue in the Aviation Trust Fund. 
</P>
<P>
"This has become a hidden tax," says James Brown, an official of the 
Partnership for Improved Air Travel, a coalition of airlines, aircraft 
manufacturers and frequent fliers. "Vast numbers of airline passengers have no 
idea that they are paying a tax to the government and how abusive the 
government has been with the money." 
</P>
<P>
Brown added that the money must be used before long. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the air transportation resources are at capacity in this 
country," he says. "The money must be used to keep up with the demand for 
increased travel. If we don't make these investments now, we will be closer and 
closer to gridlock in our air transportation system as we approach the 21st 
Century." 
</P>
<P>
Other taxes are also passed on to passengers as surcharges. When local 
municipalities tax the airlines, the carriers frequently pass the burden on to 
their customers. Such was the case with recent fuel taxes levied in several 
cities and in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Delta Air Lines levies a $2-per-ticket surcharge for passengers flying from 
Florida, $5 from Chicago, $1 from Denver and $2.50 from Boston. The added 
prices, says Delta, result from higher fuel taxes ththeo hat it must pay in 
those cities. Most of the other carriers have done the same, although a few 
charge $2 from Denver. American Airlines says it has had such surcharges in 
effect for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, the airlines act as tax collectors for the government. Travelers 
entering the United States must pay $5 for customs even if their bags aren't 
inspected. 
</P>
<P>
And pending in Congress is a charge to cover services of the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service, a levy that would have to be paid by all persons 
entering the country, will also be $5. 
</P>
<P>
Local airports are not allowed to charge passenger taxes. But Congress is 
considering a bill that would allow localities to levy a Passenger Facility 
Tax, or head tax. It would be $3 per enplanement with a maximum of $6 each way. 
A person making a connection would be levied the maximum. 
</P>
<P>
But not all the surcharges are the result of government edict. 
</P>
<P>
Airlines impose surcharges to defray their security costs. Pan American World 
Airways charges passengers $10 round trip to underwrite the costs of the 
intensive security inspections required by federal regulations on U.S. flag 
airlines. Delta's security surcharge, which applies only to transatlantic 
passengers, is $5 each way. All other carriers have followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
Often airlines pass on added fuel costs to passengers without calling them 
surcharges by simply raising fares. Last January, most carriers increased 
ticket prices 4% to reflect the soaring cost of jet fuel.

DOW RALLY CONTINUES AS FED CUTS KEY RATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The stock market rose to another record Friday as the Federal Reserve made good 
on its Thursday promise to ease interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index closed up 10.40 points to a record 2,980.20 -- 
ignoring the Friday the 13th jinx. The Dow had made a powerful run at the 3,000 
mark, piercing it just briefly in early afternoon before quickly falling back 
on profit taking. The index rose 37.13 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
On Wall Street and elsewhere, meanwhile, the debate intensified over whether 
the market's renewed strength is just a prelude to a '90s boom. 
</P>
<P>
New York Stock Exchange volume continued heavy for a second straight day, 
reaching 215.60 million shares Friday. And in a sign of broad investor 
interest, the NYSE composite index hit a new high, rising 1.01 points to 
200.33. The old record was 200.21, set June 4. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks advanced as the Federal Reserve acted to push market interest rates 
lower by pumping cash into the banking system. The move came on the heels of 
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony on Capitol Hill on Thursday, during 
which Greenspan suggested that the central bank might have to ease rates to 
counter a credit crunch caused by skittish bankers. 
</P>
<P>
The federal funds rate -- the Fed-influenced rate that banks charge each other 
for overnight loans -- fell to 8% Friday from 8.25% Thursday, as the Fed acted. 
</P>
<P>
Stubborn interest rates have been the chief obstacle that many investors have 
cited in their reluctance to join Wall Street's spring rally. Now, with rates 
heading lower, more investors may decide that the people buying stocks in May 
and June knew something that the rest of Wall Street didn't. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Greenspan's statement took a lot of people by surprise," said Ron 
Ognar, manager of the Kemper Growth stock mutual fund in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The market's failure to top the 3,000 level on its first attempt wasn't 
surprising, analysts said, given the psychological significance of that mark. 
But the bulls believe that there is an ongoing -- and dramatic -- shift in 
investors' attitude that will propel stocks higher both short-term and 
long-term. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a momentum market now. People want to believe in it," said Eric 
Miller, strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities in New York. 
The 3,000 level will probably be easily breached very soon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
What investors have been wrestling with since last fall is the idea of a return 
to basics on Wall Street. The speculative takeover game of the late 1980s was 
finished by the death of junk bond financing in 1989. Now, more investors are 
focusing on individual stocks for their growth potential -- the traditional 
approach to investing that fell out of favor in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same game again that it was 10 years ago or 20 years ago: picking the 
right stocks," Ognar said. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some analysts say there increasingly appears to be a change in 
investors' time horizons. While the 1980s were categorized by short-term 
thinking, more investors seem to be viewing stocks' potential now with a 
longer-term perspective. The fall of communism and the boom in world trade 
suggest major opportunities for companies to prosper in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"I think people are saying that there are some wonderful multinational 
companies out there that are likely to enjoy a great environment in the '90s," 
Miller said. Such stocks as Boeing, Disney, Merck and Coca-Cola, for example, 
all have enjoyed strong runs this year. "People don't want to sell them," 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Stocks also look more alluring compared to the alternatives. Real estate values 
are declining in many regions; there are no new junk bonds to buy, and 
declining interest rates mean that bank CDs will become even less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, some experts believe that the market has taken too rosy a view of the 
near-term outlook. "I still think we're in a bear market," says Richard 
Russell, editor of Dow Theory Letter in La Jolla. Yes, capitalism is spreading 
worldwide, he says. "But it's going to take a lot of money to finance all of 
it," he said. He believes that means higher interest rates ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Other analysts worry about the market's potential to sell off over the next few 
months if Congress and the Bush Administration make no progress toward an 
agreement to slash the federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Still, unless the world economy crumbles over the next few years, experts admit 
that it's tough to figure why stock prices shouldn't be substantially higher by 
the mid-'90s. And if investors are truly looking that far ahead, the current 
rally may just be a start. 
</P>
<P>
Don't underestimate the ability of markets to far exceed expectations when 
emotions begin to turn, says Peter Anderson, who manages $1.2 billion in stock 
funds for Federated Investors in Pittsburgh. "We can talk all we want about 
fundamentals," he says, "but any market has a tremendous amount of psychology 
in it, up or down." 
</P>
<P>
Friday market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
* On the NYSE, 954 stocks rose while 619 declined. Buying was heaviest in 
airline stocks, which have lagged recently. AMR jumped 2 to 63 3/8, USAir added 
1 1/2 to 25 3/4 and Alaska Air rose 3/4 to 23 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
* Industrial stocks also gained, investors betting on the likelihood of a 
stronger economy as interest rates fall. Bethlehem Steel rose 7/8 to 17 3/8, GE 
gained 1 1/2 to 74 7/8 and Ingersoll Rand rose 1 3/8 to 58 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
* Castle &amp; Cooke rocketed 6 to 36 1/2 on news that it may sell its Dole 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
* In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei average gained 69.05 points to 32,644.37. In 
London, stocks ended higher in dull trading. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 
100-share index was up 11.7 points to close at 2,382.2. In Frankfurt, strong 
buying of a handful of stocks boosted the 30-share DAX index 15.11 points to 
1,931.33. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
Bond Prices Climb Broadly Once Again 
</P>
<P>
Bond prices posted another broad advance as the Federal Reserve moved to ease 
credit. A modest wholesale inflation report for June helped. 
</P>
<P>
A day after Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted that the Fed was poised to relax 
credit conditions because loans were becoming harder to get, the Fed injected 
reserves into the banking system, pushing the benchmark federal funds rate to 
8% from 8.25%. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds rallied on the news: The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond climbed 17/32 
point, or about $5.25 per $1,000 face amount. Its yield dropped to 8.45% from 
8.49% late Thursday. The yield was 8.56% as recently as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Short-term interest rates also fell. Rates on 3-month T-bills slid to 7.60% 
from 7.68% Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CURRENCY 
</P>
<P>
Dollar Rebounds in Volatile Trading 
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose domestically Friday in heavy trading after falling in Europe. 
Traders said the dollar rose after the Commerce Department reported that 
wholesale prices climbed a modest 0.2% in June, indicating low inflation. But 
an easing of interest rates by the Fed then knocked the dollar, on the 
expectation that lower rates will make dollar-denominated investments less 
attractive. 
</P>
<P>
Later in trading, the dollar climbed again, partly because European traders 
were buying to shore up their positions.

In Tokyo, the dollar fell to its lowest level since Feb. 22, closing at 147.42 
yen, down 1.48 yen from Thursday. Later in London, the dollar firmed to 147.50 
yen. In New York, one dollar bought 148.15 yen, up from 147.40 yen late 
Thursday.

Gold Futures Strong for a Second Day

Gold futures prices rallied strongly on New York's Commodity Exchange. The 
August contract rose $6.20 to $365.70 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
The rally in gold extended a $3.90 gain posted Thursday after Greenspan's 
comments. Some traders are betting that an easing of interest rates will lead 
to new economic strength and eventually higher inflation. 
</P>
<P>
But Bernard Savaiko, analyst with Paine Webber, said other conditions did not 
appear right for gold to sustain the rally.

SEARS EXPECTS 32% DROP IN 2ND-QUARTER PROFIT; 
</P>
<P>
EARNINGS: THE FIRM CITES CASUALTY LOSSES IN ITS INSURANCE UNIT, INCLUDING 
CALIFORNIA FIRE CLAIMS. 
</P>

<P>
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. said Friday that it expects about a 32% decline in its 
second-quarter profit from continuing operations because of anticipated lower 
profit from its retail operations and its Allstate Insurance Group. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance group profit will be depressed in part because of higher than 
expected casualty losses, including those from recent fires in Southern 
California, the Chicago-based retailer said. 
</P>
<P>
Other insurance carriers with substantial homeowner protection exposure in 
Southern California are also expected to have big losses from the fires, but 
there is no evidence yet that the fires will greatly affect their profits. 
State Farm Mutual Insurance Co., which ranks first in California in premiums 
earned from homeowners insurance, is projecting $42 million in claims from the 
California fires. Farmers Group, also among the top 10 homeowners insurers, 
said it expects about $26 million in claims. 
</P>
<P>
A Sears spokesman declined to give more details about the insurance group's 
expected losses until the company officially reports its second quarter 
financial results later this month. 
</P>
<P>
Allstate was expected to report lower profits before the Southern California 
fires, in part because of regulatory pressure on the insurance company's 
profits in several states, including California and New Jersey, which are 
attempting to control rising automobile insurance rates, said Edward A. Weller, 
an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
The insurance company's profit will suffer this year in comparison to last year 
because the weather was better last year -- presenting fewer than normal claims 
for storm damage, said N. Richard Nelson, an analyst with Chicago-based Duff 
&amp; Phelps. Weather-related damage claims are more normal this year, he said, 
adding, "the environment is tougher because of the fires." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Sears said it expects to earn about 65 cents a share from continuing 
operations, compared to 95 cents a per share, or $391.2 million from continuing 
operations in the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Wall Street expected Sears to report lower second-quarter earnings, "but the 
magnitude surprised me," Nelson said. Expectations were based in part on the 
lackluster performance of Sears' merchandising group, which has been suffering 
for some time from increased competition from discount stores. The company's 
big price reduction last year improved sales some, analysts said, but not 
significantly. 
</P>
<P>
Sears' stock price dipped 37 1/2 cents Friday, to $34.25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Separately, Sears said Friday that gross revenue from continuing operations in 
the merchandise group for the five weeks ended July 7 rose 3.7%, compared to 
the same period last year.

Eye Drug Recalled: The Food and Drug Administration is recalling the 
prescription eye drug Opticrom, a solution of cromolyn sodium sold in 
10-milliliter bottles, citing the threat of potentially blinding bacterial 
infection. FDA officials said Fisons Corp. of Rochester, N.Y., is voluntarily 
pulling the drug off the market after tests showed that two lots -- stamped 
KF7A and KF35V -- may be contaminated with bacteria that can cause 
vision-threatening infections in people whose eyes are scratched or damaged. 
Bottles with those two lot numbers should be returned to pharmacies, the FDA 
said.

Insider Trading Conviction Upheld: U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson upheld an 
insider trader conviction against Brian J. Callahan, an Anaheim stockbroker, 
and William N. Jackson, a Torrance printer, ruling that the defendants engaged 
in securities fraud when they traded stocks based on information culled from 
advance copies of Business Week magazine. The men were convicted in May of 
conspiring to make profit by trading stocks based on information not yet 
available to the public. The men had challenged the conviction, contending that 
there were no securities violations because they did not obtain information 
directly from companies in which they invested.

RICK DU BROW: ROSE KENNEDY: ANOTHER PROFILE IN COURAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW

<TEXT>
<P>
Maria Shriver is doing "a little remembrance about Grandma" this weekend on 
NBC's "Sunday Today" show. Grandma is the extraordinary Rose Kennedy, matriarch 
of the American political dynasty, who will be 100 years old on July 22. 
</P>
<P>
And Shriver, her 34-year-old granddaughter, doesn't need press credentials to 
get into the family compound at Hyannisport, Mass., where a celebration will be 
held Sunday kicking off the centennial birthday week. 
</P>
<P>
Well known in her own right as an NBC correspondent, and married to film star 
Arnold Schwarzenegger -- who's also heading East for the birthday bash -- 
Shriver put together a touching and amusing piece about Mrs. Kennedy for the 
morning "Sunday Today" series, which will be broadcast at 7 a.m. on Channels 4, 
36 and 39. 
</P>
<P>
We hear the forceful matriarch saying firmly after the assassinations of her 
sons, President John F. Kennedy and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who was killed as 
he sought election to the White House, that she was "not going to be 
vanquished." We also see her, in a light moment, as a feisty and thoroughly 
unawed mother who brings down the house by upstaging Robert in a public 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she's slightly embarrassed but thrilled because people are making a 
fuss over her birthday," Shriver, who is based at NBC's Burbank studios and 
lives in Pacific Palisades, said before flying to Massachusetts today. 
</P>
<P>
"The theme of the party is 100 years of progress in the field of mental 
retardation. My aunt Rosemary (one of Mrs. Kennedy's children, now in her 70s) 
is retarded. They're giving out awards to people who've made a difference in 
retardation." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the prepared piece about her grandmother, which she wrote, 
Shriver said, "I'll be doing a live wraparound -- I'll talk a little bit about 
the day's events and progress in retardation. And then my mother (Eunice 
Shriver, another Kennedy daughter) and I are going to do a little remembrance 
about Grandma for like five minutes. And I'll do several minutes at the top of 
the hour." 
</P>
<P>
Shriver said that the master of ceremonies for the Sunday party will be Robert 
MacNeil of PBS' "MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" -- and "all the family's gonna be 
there." Asked about Schwarzenegger's relationship with Rose Kennedy, Shriver 
laughed and said: 
</P>
<P>
"She's great with Arnold. When I first brought Arnold to Hyannisport, which is 
now 13 years ago, we would take walks, the three of us. And she'd speak to him 
in German and ask him about the operas in Austria and Salzburg and all that 
sort of stuff -- probably subjects that I don't think he was that keen to 
discuss. 
</P>
<P>
"But the biggest piece of advice she ever gave me was: Don't ever worry about 
who anybody else thinks you should marry or be with -- just follow your heart. 
That's the way she married and that's the way she conducted her life. And for 
me it was always solid advice." 
</P>
<P>
Snippets of the "Sunday Today" piece are taken from an audiotape that Shriver 
made of a conversation with her grandmother in the living room of the Kennedy 
home in Palm Beach, Fla., when the matriarch was 92. And in one brief, funny 
exchange, Mrs. Kennedy questions the accomplishments of her grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hysterical," Shriver recalls as she elaborates on what is left out of 
the TV piece. "When I said, 'Well, aren't you proud of your grandchildren?,' 
she said, 'Well, I don't know. Have they accomplished anything?' And then I 
started naming them and she goes, 'Well, I don't know why so many of them are 
in law school. Does the country really need that many more lawyers?' " 
</P>
<P>
Although Shriver had cut out a major name for herself on TV, she says her 
grandmother thought there were more important things than that, too: 
</P>
<P>
"When I was anchoring 'Sunday Today' and doing a show every week until I got 
pregnant, she would watch all the time. And I would say, 'I'm doing this,' and 
she'd say, 'That's very nice -- but are you happy?' She was always less 
concerned about my work and more concerned about my own personal happiness. 
</P>
<P>
"Grandma isn't the kind of person who's flabbergasted by what you're doing 
professionally, but always wants to know, 'How is your life?' To me, that was 
always a great credit to her because everybody else talks to you about your job 
all the time, and she talks about your life." 
</P>
<P>
What makes a happy life also seems to be on Shriver's mind more these days 
since giving birth to her daughter, Katherine, half a year ago: 
</P>
<P>
"I was anchoring 'Sunday Today' for the last couple of years and also (NBC's) 
weekend nightly news, and I gave them up in April so I wouldn't have to travel. 
I was going back and forth to New York every week for the last four years. So I 
got some sanity while I was on my maternity leave and said, 'Enough already.' 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm doing for NBC now is developing this new (untitled) prime-time 
magazine show, which is scheduled to debut Aug. 14 and ideally will air every 
two months. I'm the anchor and reporter; it's about people out there on the 
cutting edge -- unpredictable and unconventional -- in all fields, and it's 
supposed to be announced Tuesday. And in two weeks I'm going to substitute for 
Tom Brokaw. So I'm doing those kinds of things." 
</P>
<P>
And if her new series is a hit and is scheduled more often? Half-joking, she 
said: "I hope not. But you never know. As they say to me, I'm the only person 
in television trying to get off the air, or get on the air less." 
</P>
<P>
She doesn't know what she wants to do next -- "Everything interests me, and 
television wants to pigeonhole you." She's not even sure if she wants to stay 
in television. 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't know. I mean, if you'd asked me that seven months ago, I would 
have said, 'Absolutely.' At the moment, I just want to bring up a good kid. 
Kids really need focus and influence. I was blessed with parents that did that 
and do it still, full-time. And when I had my child, I just said to myself, 
'I'm not gonna get another chance at this kid's life.' And what do I want -- 
just to see myself on camera every week? 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really glad because I'm there to see the teeth come in, the crawling. I 
know her sleeping patterns. I take her on all my shoots. I want her to be the 
most important part of my life. My career was for the past 13 years. And now 
it's not. And that's OK, too. That's fine."

<P>
At Thursday evening's premiere performance of Ronn Yedidia's Concerto for Piano 
and Electronic Instruments, pianist Kenneth Bookstein shook the Sherwood 
Auditorium rafters, sending a few patrons scurrying for the exits. In this 
context, where experiment is all too rare, it was a welcome sight. 
</P>
<P>
Monday's concert inaugurated the Athenaeum's weeklong series of arts events, 
celebrating the move into newly renovated quarters for La Jolla's unique music 
and fine arts library. 
</P>
<P>
Bookstein, a former La Jollan who now lives in New York, chose a program that 
balanced the hallowed keyboard repertory of Bach, Schumann and Chopin with 
Yedidia's newly completed opus, a signal that the Athenaeum is striving to be 
more than just a museum preoccupied with past achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Yedidia's expansive, single movement concerto recast the Lisztian, virtuoso 
piano concerto in the contemporary medium of piano and computer-controlled 
electronic instruments. From the standpoint of structure, the young Israeli 
composer broke no new ground; he relied on the skillful alternation and 
juxtaposition of his two instruments. 
</P>
<P>
The Concerto lasted just under 30 minutes, but Yedidia's wealth of invention 
and compact construction justified the duration. Although he favored dense, 
complex textures, he did not eschew thematic development. 
</P>
<P>
Bookstein confidently projected the work's bold piano part. Although it is 
tempting to compare Yedidia's keyboard idiom with the restless Expressionism of 
early Schoenberg or late Scriabin, the composer has his own voice. His writing 
for the electronic component was less convincing, however. Naive, synthetic, 
the sounds too frequently brought to mind the onerous moan of an electronic 
organ. 
</P>
<P>
Chopin's B Minor Sonata proved an apt showcase for Bookstein's solid technique, 
although the treacherous descending flourishes in the blazing finale exceeded 
his otherwise unfailing grasp. Bookstein brought ample brilliance and agility 
to the familiar work, which he shaped with a perceptive, analytical eye and 
ear. No sentiment clouded his Apollonian vision of the Sonata. 
</P>
<P>
Bookstein is a fluent, serious performer, although he makes his case with 
relentless ardor. He appears to need some reassurance that he will not lose his 
audience if he lingers over a phrase or indulges in an occasional rubato. 
</P>
<P>
It was difficult to warm to Bookstein's pair of Robert Schumann selections from 
"Phantasie-stucke," Op. 12, although they were performed with frenetic 
dispatch. His Schumann was all inflamed passion, but without the mystery and 
intimacy, that "Des Abends" requires. 
</P>
<P>
Bookstein opened his program with an intense and slightly larger than life 
Prelude and Fugue in D Minor from the second volume of J. S. Bach's 
"Well-Tempered Clavier."

CRACKING THE 'KOUROS' CASE; 
</P>
<P>
GETTY GETS FIRST LOOK AT KNOWN FAKE IN ATTEMPT TO AUTHENTICATE PRIZED STATUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The J. Paul Getty Museum has launched an extensive examination of its prized 
"Kouros," a 6-foot, 8-inch-tall marble sculpture of a nude young man. Thought 
to be a rare 6th-Century BC Greek statue, the sculpture has been prominently 
displayed as one of the museum's three most valued antiquities, along with a 
marble "Aphrodite" and a bronze "Victorious Athlete." 
</P>
<P>
But a fake archaic torso, recently discovered in Switzerland, has cast doubt on 
the figure's authenticity, leading the museum to remove the "Kouros" last week 
and purchase the fake for study purposes. The torso arrived in Malibu on 
Thursday, in preparation for an examination that is expected to continue for 
several months and involve experts at the museum, the Getty Conservation 
Institute and independent laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
Marion True, the Getty's curator of antiquities, will conduct a stylistic 
analysis of the two statues, while antiquities conservator Jerry Podany and 
Getty scientists investigate the stone, surface deposits and other physical 
properties. They hope to arrive at a conclusion about a statue that has already 
been extensively studied but has continued to present puzzling questions to 
scholars. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, anything is possible. We just don't know what we will find," 
said Podany, who studied the sculpture before the museum bought it in 1985 and 
conducted further examinations before the statue went on display in 1986. The 
museum reportedly purchased the piece for more than $6 million from a Swiss 
dealer acting on behalf of a private collector. In the new investigation, 
curators, conservators and scientists will weigh every scrap of evidence on 
both sides of the question and "form an opinion based on the weightiest end of 
the two columns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was disappointing to see the 'Kouros' come down, but beyond that, there's 
real excitement in the opportunity to get close to a more firm truth. We don't 
have the luxury to want it to be resolved one way or the other," Podany said. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,100-pound marble statue that once stood tall in a distinguished 
collection has been struck down -- at least temporarily -- by an imitation 
archaic Greek torso. Since buying the piece the Getty has learned that it was 
probably made in the early 1980s in Rome and that it was crafted as an 
intentional forgery. It is said to have been unsuccessfully offered to several 
collectors before the Getty got wind of it. 
</P>
<P>
The Getty has also discovered that the torso is only the central fragment of a 
larger sculpture -- and probably a last ditch effort to pass the piece off as 
the real thing. In earlier incarnations, the torso is known to have had a head, 
but apparently that was lopped off when it was thought to be too obvious a 
forgery. Now that the Getty has gone public with its investigation, True and 
Podany said that they wouldn't be surprised if other parts of the forgery were 
brought to their attention. 
</P>
<P>
The torso might never have found a respectable home if an anonymous "friend of 
the museum" hadn't seen it and told True about its existence. The call came 
late in April, just as she was leaving for Athens to give a lecture, True said, 
so she quickly made arrangements to see the piece in Switzerland during her 
trip. She wasn't allowed to photograph the sculpture and light was poor in the 
Basel port facility where the torso was stored, but she was sufficiently 
concerned about apparent similarities to send for Podany. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt like someone had kicked me when I first saw it. I wasn't prepared for 
it, even though the person who told me about it is someone I respect," True 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Most casual viewers would not understand why True was troubled. The torso is 
roughly two-thirds the scale of the Getty's complete figure and the workmanship 
is comparatively crude. A nasty brown surface -- the result of an attempt to 
artificially age the piece by boiling it in acid -- contrasts sharply with the 
glowing, off-white surface of the "Kouros." 
</P>
<P>
What True saw beneath the grime were stylistic qualities similar to those of 
the "Kouros." These characteristics were all the more disturbing because they 
seemed to correspond to anomalies in the "Kouros" that have subjected it to 
scholarly debate over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Looking over the torso shortly after it was unpacked in Malibu, True pointed 
out "narrow, sloping shoulders" that differ from other "Kouros" figures. Both 
sculptures have "insensitively carved" hands with straight cuts separating the 
fingers, they lack a feeling of "internal structure" in the wrist area and the 
carving appears soft in the upper arms, she said. 
</P>
<P>
While in Athens, True re-examined familiar "Kouros" figures to see if these 
features turned up in pieces that have long been accepted as authentic, but she 
observed that the Getty figure and the torso seemed to have more in common with 
each other than with the statues in Greece. 
</P>
<P>
After their initial trip to see the torso, True and Podany returned to Malibu 
and presented their findings to the board of directors. In mid-June, they went 
back to Basel with small plaster castings of parts of the "Kouros" that 
included stylistic details and evidence of tool work. They compared castings of 
the hands, collar bone, abdomen and navel, groin area and grooves between the 
arms and the chest with similar parts of the the torso. Podany also took a tiny 
sample of marble from the torso and found that the two sculptures were made of 
the same kind of stone, possibly from the same quarry on the Island of Thasos. 
</P>
<P>
True's informant had indicated that the two statues might have been created in 
the same studio and possibly from the same block of stone. Though the 
antiquities trade is notoriously subject to implausible rumors, True and Podany 
said that no possibility could be overlooked. In this case, the sample of stone 
lent credence to the theory that the two sculptures were closely connected. 
Persuaded that the museum needed to own the torso to conduct a serious, 
in-house study, Podany and True got the board's permission to buy the piece. 
True made a third trip to Basel last week to arrange for transport. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary findings don't appear to bode well for the Getty, but Podany and 
True point out that there are as many differences as similarities between the 
two pieces. True said her concerns were only "visual reactions" that might be 
disproved or mitigated by scientific findings. Perhaps the most persuasive 
evidence in favor of authenticity is that tests conducted five years ago on the 
"Kouros" indicated that the surface crust had been created naturally over a 
long period of time. Scientists know of no way to duplicate that surface 
artificially, but even that conclusion will be reconsidered, Podany said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't think a forger could create that surface intentionally, but we have 
to look into the possibility that it was done accidentally. We have tried a lot 
of things, but so far nothing has come close," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Getty is just beginning to plan its strategy for examining the sculptures, 
Podany said. Among first steps, he and other scientists will determine the 
elemental composition of the torso's marble, including trace elements, and 
measure the size and orientation of the grain. To do this, he will take tiny 
samples from both sculptures. As in past studies, data will be analyzed at the 
Getty and at two or more independent labs for the sake of comparison and 
accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
A full-scale, accurate reproduction of the torso will be made in plaster 
because the dark crust is "distracting," Podany said. In addition, the torso's 
surface will be replicated on a similar piece of stone. 
</P>
<P>
Unwelcome as it may be, the forgery has real historical value, True said. In 
the uncertain field of antiquities, it is "the first piece of concrete 
evidence" that backs up doubts about the "Kouros." "We have to continually try 
to figure out what a forger could or couldn't do and what his motivation might 
be. It's a very treacherous game to play," she said.

JACK MATHEWS: IN HOLLYWOOD, THE ONLY CREED IS PLAIN GREED; 
</P>
<P>
ENTERTAINMENT: SOME CHARGE THAT A WHITE-MALE FRATERNITY OF EXECUTIVES STILL 
DECIDES WHO GETS TO JOIN THE CLUB.

<P>
During this week's NAACP convention in Los Angeles, a report was released 
showing evidence that blacks are woefully underrepresented among Hollywood 
management. As a shocker, this one compares to Surgeon General reports showing 
that people who suck tobacco smoke into their lungs are apt to die sooner than 
those who don't. 
</P>
<P>
All you have to do is look around -- on the screen, behind the camera, in the 
executive suite, in studio commissaries -- to know that Hollywood is 
predominantly a white man's game. Blacks are excluded, for sure, but so are 
Asians, Latinos and women of all hues. 
</P>
<P>
'Twas always thus. 
</P>
<P>
The real shocker of the convention was the conclusion drawn by one black leader 
during a panel discussion on "Blacks in the Entertainment Industry" that the 
blacks-need-not-apply sign was put up in Hollywood by the Jews in charge. 
</P>
<P>
"If Jewish leaders can complain of black anti-Semitism, our leaders should 
certainly raise . . .the century-old problem of Jewish racism in Hollywood," 
said Legrand Clegg, the Compton city attorney who chairs the Coalition Against 
Black Exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
Clegg's conclusion is the tail end of a false syllogism -- many Hollywood 
leaders are Jewish/few blacks are employed in Hollywood/therefore Jews are 
racists -- but his anger is understandable. For most of this century, Hollywood 
has been the Western World's primary source of popular entertainment, and 
blacks have had almost no access to it. If the leadership is not to blame, then 
who, or what? 
</P>
<P>
Jewish leaders in the community reacted quickly to media coverage of the NAACP 
panel, issuing comments of their own that ranged from countercharges of 
anti-Semitism to a call for an open dialogue between leaders from both groups. 
But the most telling reaction of all was the non-reaction of leaders in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Not one member of Hollywood's white-male fraternity of studio bosses, Jew or 
Gentile, would respond to Clegg's charge this week, or discuss the issues of 
the industry's scandalously poor record of minority employment. To ring up 
executives with questions on almost any non-film issue is to watch them 
disappear like sea anemones poked with a stick. 
</P>
<P>
The thing that has been consistent in Hollywood from the mogul days to the 
global days is its leaders' certainty that their business stands apart from the 
rest of society. Individually, the rich and powerful with political consciences 
may participate actively in the system, raise and donate funds for righteous 
causes, even protest injustices they see out there in the real world. But to 
lend the weight of their own studios to the causes, or to do the right thing 
about inequities in their own companies, is to take risks that might weaken 
their own grasp on power. 
</P>
<P>
There are five "isms" to Hollywood, black actor-producer Jim Brown said at the 
convention Tuesday -- "nepotism, sexism, racism, cronyism and good-ol'-boyism." 
In other words, it's a self-perpetuating club where the value of leadership is 
measured by the number of powerful relationships. If there are any blacks, 
Latinos, Asians or women reading this who can deliver an Arnold Schwarzenegger, 
Jack Nicholson, Eddie Murphy or Tom Cruise vehicle, please show up for work on 
Monday -- any studio. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood is not inherently racist, it is inherently avaricious. It is a 
market-sensitive business that cannot exist without being on good terms with 
the lowest common denominators of society, and one look at this summer's 
release schedule will show how hard it is working to feed that need. 
</P>
<P>
"The film industry is almost like a quasi-political industry," film historian 
Neal Gabler said in a phone interview Thursday. Gabler meticulously chronicled 
the Jewish involvement in Hollywood through the mogul era in his book "An 
Empire of Their Own." "Every film has to attract a large constituency, and that 
is the white middle class," Gabler said. "It doesn't make any difference who's 
deciding which movies to make. The only ones that become blockbusters are those 
that attract that constituency." 
</P>
<P>
When he speaks to Jewish groups, Gabler said, he's often asked why Hollywood 
doesn't make more films on Jewish themes. "I tell them that when they're more 
than 4% of the population, there will be more movies.' It's the same for blacks 
(who represent 12% of the population)." 
</P>
<P>
The situation for studio heads is pretty simple. With most of them operating on 
three-year contracts, their tenures become Visionquests, triumphs of survival 
rather than attempts at pure leadership. If they have a high ratio of hits to 
misses, they can weather any storm outside. So, they hide from issues that have 
become priorities for upper management in other industries, and they get away 
with it because very quickly they either become heroes to their shareholders or 
are sent packing to the lucrative humiliation of independent production. 
</P>
<P>
Gabler believes the black community has to look to Bill Cosby, Eddie Murphy, 
Michael Jackson and other blacks whose stardom gives them the power to affect 
employment. "That's where the clout is," said Gabler. At the NAACP panel, Jim 
Brown told the black audience, "You need to make our stars come to the table 
and reinvest with you." 
</P>
<P>
But putting pressure on minorities who have succeeded seems neither fair nor 
realistic, and it diverts attention away from the real power. Only when the 
heads of the major studios commit to improving their employment records will 
there be any progress. And they will only do that when they have to.

SO. BAPTIST UNIT FIRES ANTI-SMUT SALVO IN NEA DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN PARACHINI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A policy committee of the 14.9 million-member Southern Baptist Convention has 
told members of Congress the denomination will call for abolition of the 
National Endowment for the Arts unless strict controls are enacted barring 
federal funds for "obscene, highly offensive, morally repugnant and 
sacrilegious art." 
</P>
<P>
The Baptist group -- the nation's largest Protestant denomination -- became the 
first major church body to formally demand strict and religion-oriented 
controls over the NEA since a controversy broke out last year over endowment 
funding of controversial artists and artworks. 
</P>
<P>
The new action was taken by the convention's Nashville-based Christian Life 
Commission, which is empowered to take positions on behalf of the entire 
denomination, according to commission spokesman Louis Moore. Moore said the 
commission sent letters to every member of Congress on June 10. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, those who are responsible for awarding grants at the NEA have 
(funded), and will continue to fund, activities which most Americans find 
highly offensive," said commission executive director Richard D. Land. Land 
noted that the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention in New Orleans 
last month had been unable to act on the anti-NEA resolution because the issue 
came up for action the last day of the meeting, when a quorum was absent. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no doubt that if the convention had been given the opportunity to act 
upon this resolution, it would have overwhelmingly approved it," Land said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission's letter to Congress complained about photographs by the late 
Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano -- the images that set off the 
controversy last year. It also questioned the propriety of NEA grants to other 
artists whose work has been the subject of bitter attacks by right-wing 
religious organizations and conservative politicians.

WEATHER BEFRIENDS FIREFIGHTERS IN VANQUISHING CHINO HILLS BLAZE

CHINO HILLS STATE PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Light winds mixed with high humidity and scattered showers helped firefighters 
gain the upper hand on a fast-moving brush fire Friday that had raged out of 
control in the hilly countryside between Yorba Linda and the San Bernardino 
County line. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, the second to burn through the environmentally sensitive area in less 
than three weeks, charred more than 6,500 acres of state parkland, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty much under control," Orange County Fire Department spokeswoman 
Maria Sabol said. "It's going nowhere now." 
</P>
<P>
With mop-up procedures well under way, most of the 700 firefighters who were 
called in to battle the blaze were released back to their stations, Sabol said. 
</P>
<P>
About 150 firefighters were left to monitor and attack the numerous hot spots 
that remain, Sabol said. They are expected to stay at the fire scene at least 
through today. 
</P>
<P>
Firefighters got a quicker-than-expected handle on the blaze, which swept 
across acres of tinder-dry sagebrush, grass and scrub oak, thanks to an 
unusually high level of humidity that blanketed much of Southern California 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered sprinkles in the area Friday also served to quench the flames that on 
Thursday bounded across the rural territory at speeds estimated to be more than 
25 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
By early Friday morning, fire officials declared the blaze 95% contained and 
began sending home weary firefighters who had worked throughout the night 
battling the stubborn fire. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got it surrounded, but there are occasional flare-ups, and we'll be 
controlling it for a few days," Orange County Fire Capt. Dan Young said as he 
surveyed the scorched hillside. 
</P>
<P>
Still, a blanket of smoke hovered above Yorba Linda and surrounding areas for 
most of Friday, extending for more than five miles in all directions. Steaming 
ash covered thousands of acres of hillside in Soquel Canyon, where most of the 
flames were concentrated. 
</P>
<P>
The Chino Hills fire was the second in recent weeks in the area. On June 27, 
fire consumed 6,600 acres in nearby Carbon Canyon off Carbon Canyon Road, a 
bucolic country roadway that environmental activists are attempting to have 
designated as a scenic highway in an effort to preserve the pristine area from 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, Soquel Canyon now looks like Carbon Canyon, where we had the fire 
a few weeks ago," said David Miller, president of the Chino Hills Land 
Conservancy. "It's a really nice area out here, and it's a shame that it's all 
burned." 
</P>
<P>
The blaze was started accidentally by a 15-year-old boy playing with a model 
rocket near his home in Yorba Linda, on the southwestern corner of the park, 
authorities said. The youth, who was not identified because he is a minor, 
apparently launched the rocket into a highly flammable grassy area that soon 
exploded into flames. Fueled by moderate winds, the flames quickly spread 
north. 
</P>
<P>
The boy suffered minor burns to his legs trying to extinguish the fire, then 
ran to a telephone and dialed 911, fire officials said. Although he apparently 
did not start the fire deliberately, he will likely be held liable for the 
tremendous expense of the firefighting effort, which could exceed $1 million 
per day, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Under state law, because the youth is underage, authorities may seek to recoup 
the costs from his parents. Officials were unsure how many people in the past 
have been forced to pay for fires they started. 
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out about 12:40 p.m. Thursday near Blue Gum and Ridge Crest 
drives and raced toward the San Bernardino County line. Fire crews from the 
U.S. Forestry Service, San Bernardino County, Brea, Santa Ana and Anaheim were 
called in to assist the Orange County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
Four prison-inmate firefighters were injured, three of them impaired by smoke 
inhalation as they labored to dig trenches along the perimeter of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
A fourth inmate, whose name was being withheld, broke his arm after slipping 
some 75 feet down a canyon wall, Young said. Firefighters spent more than 1 1/2 
hours attempting to rescue the injured man, finally hauling him out of the 
ravine in a metal basket. All four inmates were treated at area hospitals and 
returned to jail. 
</P>
<P>
The only structure damaged by the fire was an unoccupied shack, firefighters 
said.

CURRENTLY, LIFEGUARDS IN HOT SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hot, muggy weather that has blanketed Orange County for the past few days 
has sent thousands flocking to the beaches in search of sea breezes and a 
respite from the stifling, furnace-like heat. 
</P>
<P>
But the combination of thong-wearing sunbathers and a brutal rip current 
generated by a hurricane off Baja California has made the days anything but 
lazy for lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
Keeping a constant vigil, the crew of mostly young men who man the lifeguard 
towers dashed into the heavy surf in a seemingly unending tide of rescues and 
warnings to bathers who found themselves swept hundreds of yards in seconds by 
the rip currents. 
</P>
<P>
"The (current) makes it tougher because you're going out more," said Brad 
Valentine, 20, a Cal State Fullerton student who was manning a lifeguard tower 
about 200 yards from the Huntington Beach pier. "You're running and swimming 
all the time. With conditions like this, it's a lot more stressful." 
</P>
<P>
For Valentine and his fellow lifeguards, there appears to be little hope for 
relief in sight. The heat and humidity, along with the sweeping storm-fueled 
currents, should last for a least a few more days, which means bigger weekend 
crowds and more unwary swimmers to be wary of. 
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists said a high-pressure system stalled over the southwestern United 
States and Hurricane Genevieve, raging about 400 miles southwest of Baja, are 
responsible for the double whammy. 
</P>
<P>
The high-pressure system trapped not only the unusually moist air but also a 
higher concentration of pollutants, causing smog readings to approach the 
unhealthful range in inland areas, according to South Coast Air Quality 
Management District figures. 
</P>
<P>
Inland temperatures reached the low 90s Friday, while the humidity hovered 
around 60% during the day and was expected to rise to a soggy 85% at night in 
parts of the county. Beach cities were just about as uncomfortably humid as the 
inland areas, but temperatures in the mid 70s sent about 50,000 people to the 
Huntington Beach shores. 
</P>
<P>
While cool, offshore breezes ranging up to 15 m.p.h. brought welcome relief for 
beach-goers, they posed an often hair-raising problem for lifeguards. Lt. Steve 
Davidson of the Huntington Beach lifeguard station said lifeguards made about 
70 rescues Thursday, compared to 10 to 15 on "a quiet summer day." At 
Huntington City Beach, lifeguards reported 39 rescues Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"Our surf picks up because of tropical storms and hurricanes," Davidson said. 
"When the wind is blowing at a high velocity, sometimes we get swells from four 
or five miles away. Then we get a real strong current because the waves hit at 
an angle, not head on, so people drift down the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Amy Dwyer, 17, and Sagi Mesa, 15, a pair of beach-goers from Huntington Beach, 
said they were swept several hundred yards in a matter of minutes by the strong 
sideways current. 
</P>
<P>
"You have no control, you keep trying to get your feet down," Mesa said. "But 
it's fun." 
</P>
<P>
Dwyer and Mesa also said that while the surf was treacherous, they did not feel 
scared because they heeded announcements over a lifeguard tower loudspeaker 
warning swimmers of strong currents. 
</P>
<P>
Lifeguard Valentine, who swam out to warn nearly a dozen swimmers of the rough 
tide and made three rescues in less than four hours, said that many bathers, 
while aware that the current was strong, were not aware that the waves and 
current could send them crashing into the the pier's heavy wooden pilings. 
</P>
<P>
"Usually people are glad to see you when you get out there. Just about 
everybody's worst fear is kissing the pier." 
</P>
<P>
Fear of the pier prompted lifeguard station officials to post three lifeguards 
at Tower 1, just a few feet from the closed pier. By early afternoon, guards 
Steve Addleman, 19, Greg Reddish, 17, and Mike Yakura, 17, had plunged after 
tired or errant swimmers about 50 times, at times returning to their post for 
less than a minute before spotting another floundering bather. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been wet all day," Addleman said. 
</P>
<P>
Times researchers Danny Sullivan and Elena Brunet contributed to this report.

WOMAN FEARFULLY CONFRONTS ATTACKER WHO STALKED HER 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This was the moment Catherine Cline had been both dreading and awaiting since 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
It was the chance to confront her former classmate at an Irvine high school who 
had admitted stalking her for seven years, keeping detailed notes on her life 
and finally attacking her with a baseball bat one grisly night in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But she was not ready for the meeting. As the acknowledged attacker, Steven 
Schumacher, was led into a Santa Ana courtroom Friday, Cline, 22, began 
trembling in her seat. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw him, I just wanted to get up and leave, I was so scared. I knew it 
was stupid -- he was in chains and he couldn't break them, but maybe. . . ," 
Cline recalled later, her voice trailing off. "I just wanted to get out of 
there." 
</P>
<P>
But Cline stayed in the courtroom. And to her relief, so did Schumacher. 
</P>
<P>
An Orange County Superior Court judge found that the 21-year-old defendant from 
Irvine, confined to Patton State Hospital for psychological treatment since 
October, is now well enough to stand trial for the assault and scheduled his 
arraignment for later this month in Municipal Court in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
If convicted on assault charges, he faces up to six years in prison. His lawyer 
may seek an insanity plea in his defense. 
</P>
<P>
Judge David O. Carter also kept the defendant's bail at $150,000, ensuring that 
he will remain behind bars, at least for now, to face allegations that he 
developed a violent obsession with his Woodbridge High School classmate, whom 
he had never even met. 
</P>
<P>
Standard bail in assault cases is $10,000. Prosecutors sought the higher level 
for Schumacher because of what they described as the brutal and persistent 
nature of his actions. Defense attorney Frank O'Rourke did not oppose the 
higher bail, saying he will probably seek to lower it later. 
</P>
<P>
"His offense was the product of a psychotic obsession," O'Rourke said, 
previewing the defense. "But two psychologists have now said that he has 
regained his mental stability. And what he needs now is to be restored to the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Cline, the defense attorney acknowledged, "may be afraid for the rest of her 
life -- we can't stop that. But in a free society, a person who's competent and 
well and has served his time has a right to be free." 
</P>
<P>
The victim said O'Rourke is right about just one thing: She will be scared the 
rest of her life. 
</P>
<P>
Cline, who manages her father's insurance office and models occasionally, said 
that since the attack, "I don't trust anybody any more. People that I meet, 
they have to prove themselves to me now." 
</P>
<P>
She said she can't imagine living alone. And she is thinking of changing her 
name for fear of what might happen when Schumacher is free. 
</P>
<P>
Once Schumacher is released, Cline is convinced, "he'd try to find me again. . 
. . He's sick. I just don't believe he could have gotten better this quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, her mother, Carolyne Cline, said she began this spring to receive 
repeated silent phone calls that she suspects were placed by Schumacher. She 
has reported her suspicions to the police, saying the calls are reminiscent of 
a string of calls -- as many as three or four a day -- that she got from 
Schumacher before the assault. 
</P>
<P>
Those earlier calls, also reported to police, culminated in this dire warning 
from Schumacher, according to police and the mother: "You can tell your 
daughter I'm going to break her neck for the last six years of my life." 
</P>
<P>
Atop the emotional and physical scars of the attack -- she suffers some hearing 
loss -- is the frustration of not knowing exactly what caused it, Cline says. 
</P>
<P>
She said she thinks Schumacher was in a science class with her during their 
senior year at Woodbridge. She also thinks that he was the unknown person who 
sent her white roses once, but she does not remember ever having talked to him. 
</P>
<P>
But Schumacher knew her. Asked by Placentia detectives after his arrest last 
year how long he had had a "fixation" with Cline, he responded: "Seven years." 
</P>
<P>
He had followed her and kept minute logs of her actions for eight months when 
she lived in Irvine. Then, after Cline moved into a gated complex in Placentia 
-- in part to escape the threatening phone calls -- he was somehow able to 
track down her address through the post office, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Schumacher said, he waited with a baseball bat in Cline's parking lot 
the night of June 19, 1989. He knew the lot because he had mapped it out and 
was able to get inside by following another car. Once Cline arrived, police 
said, Schumacher emerged from the darkness and cracked her over the head with 
the bat. 
</P>
<P>
Bloodied, she managed to escape to her home and was rushed into intensive care 
with a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
Schumacher told police he had not meant to hit her so hard. Asked by police 
after his arrest whether he still wants to hurt Cline, he said, "I don't think 
it's worth it, no." 
</P>
<P>
But police are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent just last month to authorities at Patton mental hospital, 
Irvine Police Detective Peter K. Linton put it bluntly: 
</P>
<P>
"Steven Schumacher's past speaks for itself with respect to his relentless 
pursuit of Cline. I don't wish to see Cathy Cline murdered by this person in 
the event he escapes or is released."

<P>
An armed robber dressed in a black ninja outfit held up a pizza parlor that was 
about to close, taking more than $200 before disappearing, sheriff's 
authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The bandit, described as a male Caucasian about 5 feet, 10 inches tall, 
disappeared into a large apartment complex near the intersection of Alicia 
Parkway and Paseo de Valencia, said Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Bob 
Rivas. 
</P>
<P>
Rivas said the manager and a worker were about to lock the Pizza Hut Restaurant 
on Alicia Parkway at 9:55 p.m. Thursday when the robber entered the store, 
pulled out a chrome-plated revolver and demanded cash. 
</P>
<P>
He fled on foot into an apartment complex. Deputies searched the area but found 
no suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Rivas said that the department has received no prior reports of anybody robbing 
a store or restaurant wearing a black ninja outfit. JAMES M. GOMEZ

CONTINUANCE URGED FOR WELFARE FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE GEWERTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Frustrated by the budget stalemate in Sacramento, Supervisor Don R. Roth wrote 
a letter to Gov. George Deukmejian asking for his help in bringing about an 
agreement that will guarantee a continued flow of money to Orange County's 
welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter written Thursday, Roth said the budget standoff means that $37.1 
million in state funds intended for Orange County for the month of July are 
being withheld, including $19.1 million to cover local welfare checks. 
</P>
<P>
The state Senate approved a $52-billion-plus budget Tuesday, but its tax and 
fee increases set it up for likely defeat in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
Members of a joint Senate-Assembly budget committee took up the measure Friday, 
but by afternoon they were divided and talks had stalled. 
</P>
<P>
Roth said the county's proposed budget includes provisions to continue funding 
for critical programs for a while. 
</P>
<P>
But he complained that the county is pinched unfairly in a state budget impasse 
because it is required to operate entitlement programs without state funds. 
</P>
<P>
"This current situation simply highlights the lack of state concern in 
underfunding its mandates and withholding what limited funding is required to 
support the entitlement programs," Roth wrote. 
</P>
<P>
He said he is particularly concerned because of the increasing conflict between 
growing program demands and the decrease in state funding. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe the state budgeting system must address the appropriate and timely 
funding of the programs which it requires the County of Orange to operate," 
Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
Roth suggested that the state could solve the problem by adopting a budget 
provision to ensure continuation of a current year's aid into the next fiscal 
year if necessary, or by establishing a special trust fund to cover such aid if 
lawmakers must debate the budget into the next fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that legislators draft a budget that includes July payments 
in the prior fiscal year's budget so that all mandated programs are covered 
while the new budget is debated. CATHERINE GEWERTZ

COUNTY TAKES STEPS TO CONSERVE WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA MICHAELIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The county's Environmental Management Agency on Friday announced several new 
conservation methods that the agency hopes will dramatically reduce water 
consumption by county government. 
</P>
<P>
Among other things, the agency wants to use reclaimed water for the irrigation 
system at Laguna Niguel Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
The county anticipates that it will save nearly 90% of the potable water now 
used there, according to Barbara Foster, a spokeswoman for Supervisor Harriett 
M. Wieder. 
</P>
<P>
Wieder's office, which has a record of calling for improved water management, 
announced the conservation measures in a brief news release. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County Water Conservation Task Force, formed by Wieder, prompted the 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
The EMA, the county's land-management agency, wants county parks officials to 
reduce their irrigation needs by at least 10%. 
</P>
<P>
Foster said that many parks already are watering less or watering in the 
evening and early morning when evaporation is the least. 
</P>
<P>
To provide the public more examples of how to landscape with drought-resistant 
plants, the county has authorized a $5,000 grant from its Harbors, Beaches and 
Parks Divisions for a study in Rossmoor. 
</P>
<P>
The Rossmoor Community Services District, which has received a $31,000 state 
grant, has been working for more than a year on two mini-parks which will 
demonstrate the use of drought-resistant plants. 
</P>
<P>
Community services district president Germaine Erskine said that playgrounds 
and picnic areas will serve as models for visitors to see how the park's 
designers can attractively arrange the plants. 
</P>
<P>
Ground-breaking ceremonies for the mini-parks are scheduled for Monday morning.

JOB SHARERS TRADE HOURS, BENEFITS

<P>
A new job-share program that began in Costa Mesa last month means that city 
planner Kim Brandt can now spend more time with her 6-year-old and 7-month-old 
sons. Under the same program, her colleague Kristen Caspers can return to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Caspers and Brandt, two Costa Mesa employees, are the test subjects in a 
program developed to help workers scale down their hours for personal reasons 
while keeping their jobs and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that there are changes in the work force that necessitate 
creating schedules for qualified, productive employees," said Personnel 
Director Steve Hayman. 
</P>
<P>
Both Brandt and Caspers are associate planners with the city Planning 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa, with 592 full-time employees, will review the program in six months 
and decide whether to allow other employees to split a normal 40-hour-a-week 
position with someone else. 
</P>
<P>
"I think for the most part people think this is a good program for women, but 
men could benefit from it too," Brandt said. "This is good for anyone who wants 
to go back to school or has to take care of elderly parents." 
</P>
<P>
Such an arrangement has been available to Tustin city employees for several 
years. Other cities, the county of Orange, and several private companies now 
offer the job-share alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Employees negotiate among themselves to split up the benefits. Brandt chose not 
to take the medical coverage offered by the city because she is covered under 
her husband's policy. Other employees may decide they don't need the retirement 
benefits if they don't plan on working very long with a city. 
</P>
<P>
Job-share employees are credited with a half year for retirement benefits. The 
arrangement also can affect an employee's eligibility for increased benefits 
and vacation time, Hayman said. The employees also split holiday pay. 
</P>
<P>
In essence, the two employees share the same job, usually occupying the same 
work space. MARY ANNE PEREZ

3 MEN ARRESTED IN BANK ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three men were arrested Friday on suspicion of robbing a Bank of America branch 
after a chase through North County, the Orange County Sheriff's Department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested were James H. Poland, 35, of Long Beach; George L. Heigel, 34, of 
Carson; and driver Harold Jengins, 40, address unknown, said Sheriff's 
Department spokesman Lt. Bob Rivas. 
</P>
<P>
Rivas said that, according to witnesses' accounts, one of the three men 
allegedly went into the bank about 9:25 a.m. and gave a teller a note demanding 
money. Police did not disclose how much money. 
</P>
<P>
After getting the money, the robber jumped in a 1985 Ford sedan and the three 
suspects fled north along Beach Boulevard. As sheriff's deputies arrived at the 
bank, Buena Park and Anaheim police spotted the getaway car and pursued it, 
Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
At the intersection of Brookhurst Street and La Palma Avenue in Anaheim, 
Jengins dropped off his two partners, who tried to run from police, Rivas said. 
Poland, who was captured by Anaheim police, allegedly threw a bag of money as 
he took off running. Heigel gave himself up to Buena Park police and turned 
over another bag of money, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Jengins had driven to the Santa Ana Freeway. While exiting the 
freeway at Valley View in La Mirada, Jengins spun out of control and hit a 
truck. Additional money was found on the floorboard of the truck, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
No weapons were found either on the men or in the vehicle, Rivas said.

65 FIRMS ASK TO USE BANNED CHEMICALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM McQUEENEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After receiving requests from about 65 companies for temporary exemptions from 
the city's ban on most uses of an ozone-depleting chemical, the Irvine City 
Council will consider turning the exemption process over to the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
All requests for exemptions to the ban on chlorofluorocarbons now must be 
approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The city's law on chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-depleting substances went 
into effect July 1. The council has voted twice, including this week, to grant 
55 temporary exemptions to companies that use small amounts of the chemicals, 
military contractors, firms with no feasible alternatives and companies using 
the chemicals for health-related products. 
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly been less controversial than expected, and City Council 
approval so far has been routine," said Michael S. Brown, Irvine's 
environmental program administrator. 
</P>
<P>
At the council's July 24 meeting, Brown will recommend the exemption process be 
run administratively by the city manager to avoid bogging down the City Council 
with routine paper work. 
</P>
<P>
If approved, the change would require that requests for exemptions be 
advertised so the public can have a chance to comment on them before a decision 
is made, Brown said. The council also will retain the right to take back its 
approval authority at any time. 
</P>
<P>
Under the ban, companies can apply for exemptions lasting one or more years. 
But firms must show that they are looking for alternatives or are in the 
process of phasing out the chemicals, Brown said. TOM McQUEENEY

BANNISTER MAY SEEK REELECTION AND STATE INSURANCE POST; 
</P>

<P>
In an unusual move, City Councilman Wes Bannister on Friday said he may run for 
two offices in the Nov. 6 election. 
</P>
<P>
Bannister said he may seek reelection to the City Council as well as run for 
state insurance commissioner. He is already the Republican nominee for 
insurance commissioner, having won the nomination in the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. John Garamendi (D-Walnut Grove), the Democratic nominee, said 
Bannister "obviously doesn't want to be insurance commissioner, or he wouldn't 
even be talking about this possibility (of running for two offices). I think 
it's crazy." 
</P>
<P>
Bannister's four-year term on the City Council expires this fall. Most 
political observers thought that he would not seek reelection, because he is 
running for a full-time state position. But Bannister said Friday that he is 
leaning toward running for the council again, as well as for the state office. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't made a final decision," he said, "but the way it is right now, I 
probably will run for City Council. I'm of course running for insurance 
commissioner, and I think I've got an outside chance of winning, but it's a 
long shot because my opponent, Sen. Garamendi, is going to raise about $3 
million to $4 million for his fall campaign, and I'll maybe be able to raise 
$100,000. It's awfully hard to run a statewide campaign on that little money." 
</P>
<P>
Bannister also said that if he were to lose the statewide race and not run for 
reelection to the council, "it would be hard to see someone else come on that 
council, someone with a diverging viewpoint, and destroy everything we've 
worked for. I'd have to give up on the things we've worked so hard to complete 
(in city government) in the last four years." 
</P>
<P>
One report circulated among city politicians was that Bannister planned to run 
on a slate with former Councilman Jack Kelly, former City Administrator Paul 
Cook and incumbent Councilman John Erskine, who is likely to seek reelection 
this fall. Those four, according to some sources, would be supported by the 
powerful Huntington Beach Co. 
</P>
<P>
But Bannister emphatically denied that he will run on a slate. "If I run for 
the council again, I'll be running solo," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Four seats on the council are up for election. 
</P>
<P>
Bannister's announcement threw kinks into the plans of other possible council 
candidates, most of whom had assumed that he would not be running for 
reelection. An incumbent usually has a much better chance of winning a council 
election, so Bannister's announcement threw cold water on some candidates' 
hopes. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Thomas J. Mays, whose term also expires in November, is running for the 
Assembly on Nov. 6 and has said he will not seek reelection to the council. 
Many slow-growth advocates in Huntington Beach had said they saw Mays' and 
Bannister's departures as a chance to capture a majority on the seven-member 
City Council. Mays and Bannister are considered pro-development. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Biddle, president of Huntington Beach Tomorrow, a citizen group that says 
it stresses "planned development," criticized Bannister for thinking about 
running for two positions in November. 
</P>
<P>
"Councilman Bannister has always been up front in his dealings, and we respect 
that," he said. "But the respect we in Huntington Beach Tomorrow have for him 
will evaporate if he runs for two offices. I think it would be a slap in the 
face of the Republican voters who endorsed him in the primary." 
</P>
<P>
Garamendi said Bannister is showing "insincerity" to statewide voters by 
thinking of seeking two offices at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
"If he doesn't want to be insurance commissioner, why doesn't he just say so 
and save everyone a lot of time?" Garamendi said.

LAST SUSPECT IN TEEN'S MURDER SURRENDERS

The third and last suspect in the shooting death of 17-year-old Rosendo Ibarra 
has surrendered to the Orange County Sheriff's Department, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Garden Grove police had obtained a warrant for Joseph David Kehler's arrest on 
charges of murder and street terrorism, and had been looking for him since 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Kehler, 23, walked into the Sheriff's Department in Santa Ana at 12:20 a.m. 
Thursday and surrendered, Garden Grove Police Detective Mike Handfield said. He 
is being held in Orange County Jail on $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
In previous statements to police, Kehler has said he drove several teen-agers 
to a Garden Grove shopping center on April 30 when Ibarra was gunned down at a 
pay phone there, but he said he did not know the others were planning to kill 
Ibarra. 
</P>
<P>
Handfield, however, said Friday that Kehler was involved in the plot and 
supplied the gun that was used to kill Ibarra. 
</P>
<P>
The gun was thrown out the window of Kehler's car a few blocks from the murder 
scene, where police later recovered it, Handfield said. 
</P>
<P>
"We were taken to the gun by an informant, and we had information that Kehler 
was seen with a gun that matched that identical description the day before the 
shooting," Handfield said. "We're alleging that he provided the gun that was 
used in the shooting. That makes him a principal." 
</P>
<P>
Two other suspects, Martin Rene Rodriguez, 21, and a 15-year-old boy whose name 
was not released because of his age, are already in custody. The boy was 
arrested in a police raid Monday. Rodriguez surrendered at the Garden Grove 
Police Department on Tuesday. Police charge that Rodriguez fired the shots that 
killed Ibarra. Rodriguez told relatives he was turning himself in because he 
was innocent. 
</P>
<P>
Kehler is expected to be arraigned in Orange County Municipal Court in 
Westminster on Monday, Handfield said.

ART: SUPPORTERS OF THE NATIONAL AGENCY MEET IN HUNTINGTON BEACH TO CRITICIZE 
WHAT THEY CALL A RIGHT-WING MOVEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY TO INHIBIT AND CENSOR THE 
ARTS.

<P>
In the first major public show of support in Orange County for the National 
Endowment for the Arts, about 150 people crowded into City Council chambers 
here Thursday night to listen as artists and arts activists spoke out in 
defense of the embattled federal agency. 
</P>
<P>
"The political right wing has awakened a sleeping giant, and they're going to 
live to regret it," offered Michael Hudson, vice president and general counsel 
for the organization People For the American Way, which is actively engaged in 
a range of censorship issues (the group is backing choreographer Bella Lewitzky 
in her suit against the NEA, filed Thursday). 
</P>
<P>
The formal part of the three-hour program was closed by Tim Miller, one of four 
performance artists who had been recommended for NEA fellowship grants by a 
peer review panel, but whose grants were turned down by agency Chairman John E. 
Frohnmayer, apparently to head off criticism from conservative critics. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm one artist who has fallen prey to the far right wing of this country," 
said Miller, who often tackles gay-rights issues in his work. "I'm extremely 
frightened at what is happening." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, now a Santa Monica resident, grew up in Orange County and told the 
audience of his youth here, including his first performances at Cal State 
Fullerton and Fullerton College. He attributed the denial of his NEA grant to 
"a fearful, reactionary impulse" on the part of the "white male power 
structure," and said it is part of a larger societal attack on people outside 
the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's meeting took place within the district of Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R 
-- Lomita), who, along with Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), has led congressional 
attacks on the NEA. The freshman congressman, who representions portions of 
Orange and Los Angeles counties, came under frequent attack during the forum. 
Jeffrey Chester, a media consultant, announced the formation of a Political 
Action Committee that will work specifically to defeat Rohrabacher when he 
comes up for reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, campaign supporters said they will circulate flyers today that 
denounce Rohrabacher's record on a number of issues in several Long Beach and 
Orange County shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's lone spoken dissent came from two members of the Bieber family of 
Huntington Beach: son James, a national director of the conservative Young 
Americans for Freedom, and father Dale, who identified himself as an artists' 
agent. Both argued from the Libertarian perspective, saying that artists are 
not entitled to public funds and that taxpayers should not be forced to pay for 
works that may offend them. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute between conservatives in Congress and the NEA began last year after 
protests from conservative groups over federal support of art shows containing 
controversial photographs by Andres Serrano and Robert Mapplethorpe. Last fall, 
Congress enacted a provision requiring 1990 grant recipients to sign an oath 
vowing not to produce "obscene" works. 
</P>
<P>
In late June, Frohnmayer approved grants for 14 solo performance artists, but 
denied grants to Miller, Karen Finley, Holly Hughes and John Fleck, all of whom 
deal with political and sexual issues in their work. The action was roundly 
condemned by the arts community and has helped to escalate the battle over the 
NEA. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach-based video artist Bill Viola, reading from a 20-page written 
statement, offered a detailed defense of the agency, calling it a "shining 
example of an arts patronage system" -- one that costs the average individual 
about 68 cents a year to support. 
</P>
<P>
In its 25-year history, Viola said, the agency has handed out more than 80,000 
grants. "That a few individuals can turn around and, because less than 20 of 
these projects have been overtly offensive to some, cry out for the abolition 
of the agency is beyond me and beyond any exercise of common sense and 
rationality," the artist said. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday's forum was organized by the nascent Orange County Committee of the 
Long Beach/Orange County Coalition for Freedom of Expression, with help from 
Fullerton-based Poets Reading Inc. The event, which opened with performances by 
local musicians and a poet, was billed as a "call to action" for local artists 
and other citizens to support a reauthorized NEA.

ALABAMA SERVES UP FAST-FOOD COUNTRY; 
</P>
<P>
CONCERTS: THE GROUP PERFORMED BLAND AND PREDICTABLE MUSIC, BUT OPENING ACT 
CLINT BLACK SHOWED A GENUINE FEEL FOR TRADITION. BOTH WILL APPEAR SUNDAY AT THE 
IRVINE MEADOWS AMPHITHEATRE.

If fast food was country music, it would sound like Alabama: bland, 
predictable, nutritionless, the same menu at every location and -- of course -- 
billions served, including the wildly enthusiastic sold-out crowd at the Greek 
Theatre in Los Angeles recently. All that was missing was the grease. 
</P>
<P>
With songs stitched together from simple sing-along melodies and feel-good 
greeting-card phrases, patter built around "Hello (fill in your town here)!" 
cheerleading and a presentation that seemed scripted in every detail (the 
pre-encore portion of the concert ran one hour on the nose), Alabama showed 
just what can be achieved without even having to try. 
</P>
<P>
Lead singer Randy Owen switched, as appropriate, from mugging funny man to 
patriotic booster to sentimental fool with all the depth of a lounge singer. In 
fact, the only time he stepped out from the script was to acknowledge all those 
important music industry folks at the show with a sappy version of "Bridge Over 
Troubled Water," which he said the band used to do when it was a lounge act 
back in Myrtle Beach, S.C., many moons ago. At least he acknowledges his roots. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, opening act Clint Black is a home-cooked meal of biscuits and 
gravy. At the Greek, the grinning Texan showed the legitimate feel for various 
country traditions (from Bob Wills swing to Merle Haggard work ethic) that has 
placed him just a step away from joining Randy Travis and George Strait in 
mega-headliner matinee idol status. 
</P>
<P>
But like Travis and Strait, Black seems all too willing to just slip easily 
into the cozy country envelope and showed little desire or inclination to push 
against it. Encoring with a Jimmy Buffett song hardly counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama, Clint Black and Suzy Bogguss will play Sunday at 8 p.m. at Irvine 
Meadows Amphitheatre, 8800 Irvine Center Drive, Irvine. Tickets: $19.50 to $27. 
Information: (714) 855-8096.

</P>
<P>
RESTAURANTS: CAN-CAN, MUSIC AND THAT WORLD-FAMOUS CUISINE WILL BE FEATURED 
TODAY THROUGHOUT ORANGE COUNTY AS THE SPIRIT OF LIBERTY, FRATERNITY AND 
GASTRONOMY OVERTAKE THE POPULACE.

Special menus, accordions, can-can dancers -- you can count on French 
restaurateurs to pull out all the stops for Bastille Day today. Here are a few 
options for your celebration of the 1789 attack and capture of the French 
prison fortress. 
</P>
<P>
Bastille Day commemorates the triumph of the populace, the bourgeois, according 
to Marica Hefti of Le Medi in Newport Beach. So she and her chef-husband Walter 
Ruttiman will serve from big pots of moules mariniere, the traditional mussels 
dish, on the restaurant's patio at bourgeois prices -- from $1.75. Also 
available outdoors: seafood salad and strawberries with black pepper. Inside, 
diners can sit down to a dinner of duck Bigarade (with orange), French onion 
soup and chocolate mousse, all for $14.95. The same menu will be served at 
lunchtime, from 11:30 to 3 p.m.; and dinner, from 6 until "whatever," according 
to Marica. Reservations: (714) 675-4904. 
</P>
<P>
Can-can dancers liven the festivities at several restaurants, including La Vie 
en Rose in Brea, which will also present a magician. A special multi-course 
dinner, priced at $50, will be served from 6 to 10 p.m. Reservations: (714) 
529-8333. 
</P>
<P>
The celebration began Friday at the Bouzy Rouge in Newport Beach with a French 
fashion show. Tonight's the night for the can-can dancers, an accordionist, 
door prize drawings and the opening of a methuselum (that's eight bottles' 
worth) of champagne. Service from the Parisian bistro menu begins at 6 p.m. 
Reservations: (714) 675-3440. 
</P>
<P>
At Chanteclair in Irvine, chef Byron Gemmell, will present a nine-course menu 
de degustation complemented by four wines. It's $85 per person plus tax and 
gratuity. Reservations for tonight or Saturday: (714) 752-8001. 
</P>
<P>
Accordionists set the mood for celebrating a la Francaise at several other 
restaurants, including Pascal in Newport Beach, during its festivities tonight. 
The Provencale country dinner includes four courses, all seasoned with 
Provencale herbs, of course, with a choice of such entrees as rabbit, duck and 
grilled fish. There will be wine on the tables, and the tab is $39 per person, 
exclusive of tax and tip. Reservations: (714) 752-0107. 
</P>
<P>
An accordion player will also entertain at Cafe Francais in Orange. Owner 
Jacques Duc also promises a six-course dinner, highlighting feuillete of 
scallops with caramelized onions, confit of duck with cloves and fresh 
rosemary. The tab is $36.50. Reservations: (714) 998-6051. 
</P>
<P>
In Huntington Beach, at his new Voila, the very French Yves Briee will add 
strictly French specials to his menu and pour a complimentary glass of 
champagne for each diner. Incidentally, the restaurant is now open for dinner 
only. Reservations: (714) 841-1166. 
</P>
<P>
LaFayette in Buena Park celebrates with a five-course Bastille dinner. There 
will be appetizer and soup-salad choices; salmon in lobster sauce; a selection 
of meat courses and imported cheese and pastries. It's $40 a person. 
Reservations: (714) 537-5011.

ROCK: THE CHURCH IS A POLISHED GROUP, BUT AFTER 10 YEARS OF PERFORMING, IT HAS 
NOT REMADE ITSELF ARTISTICALLY AND MANAGES TO PAINT ONLY IN A FEW DARKLY 
GLISTENING HUES. 
</P>

<P>
It is hard to imagine the Church giving a better account of itself than it did 
Thursday night at the Coach House in a set that was glistening, brooding, 
forceful and extremely well-played. But when the nearly two-hour show was over, 
one had to wonder how a band could develop for 10 years and cover so little 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
Like U2 and R.E.M., the Church spent the 1980s refining a musical personality 
that was distinctive, but narrow. The Australian band's small parcel of sonic 
and emotional space combines U2's urgent belfry chime and R.E.M.'s dreamy web 
of murmuring voices and guitars. 
</P>
<P>
Bassist Steve Kilbey sang with muted, yet convincing emotion in a voice full of 
tasteful reserve. Guitarists Peter Koppes and Marty Willson-Piper played 
glancing, finely etched parts that often used distortion effects and echo to 
evoke an encompassing rush of wind. 
</P>
<P>
Kilbey's bass-thrum and the solid, active drumming of Jay Dee Daugherty (the 
former Patti Smith Group member and Tom Verlaine sideman is touring as a 
substitute for longtime Church regular Richard Ploog) ensured that the band's 
most gauze-like textures always rested on a firm, rock pulse. 
</P>
<P>
As far as it went, that approach was fine. But instead of the versatility and 
striking contrasts that mark the work of the best rockers of the '60s and '70s, 
the Church could vary its basic ritual only by subtle shadings and small 
gradations. Within a few years of their debuts, performers like Bob Dylan, the 
Beatles and Van Morrison remade themselves many times over artistically, 
setting an expansive pattern followed by the best rockers of the '60s and '70s. 
The past decade in rock has been beset by single-minded specialization. 
</P>
<P>
It may be more than coincidence that Kilbey's outlook as a lyricist tends to be 
exceedingly bleak, frequently depicting a diminished world of stark limits. 
These are important themes, of course, and the Church often gave them 
expression that conveyed barrenness without dull droning. 
</P>
<P>
"Under the Milky Way," the band's breakthrough hit from 1988, vividly captured 
the chill of feeling like a small speck amid the vast, impersonal beauty of 
creation. "Destination" was the picture of dejection (the idea is that 
civilization has no meaningful destination), with Kilbey's usually subdued 
voice rising in a display of deep anguish. "Grind," the high point of the 
Church's current "Gold Afternoon Fix" album, was a foreboding, hard-edged song 
portraying a century staggering to an end like a punch-drunk prizefighter. 
Let's hope things turn out otherwise, but "Grind" could be one of the signature 
songs of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
But with little in the way of folk, country or blues sources, with lyrics 
skewed toward symbol and away from story lines and characterizations, with no 
humor in the songs (although Kilbey displayed a droll wit in his 
between-numbers chit-chat), and with the arrangements almost all featuring that 
wind-tunnel of guitars, the Church could only paint in a few darkly glistening 
hues. 
</P>
<P>
The show offered one nice surprise, a version of Patti Smith's "Dancing 
Barefoot" that proved a good candidate for the Church's suitably mysterious, 
wind-swept treatment, and one downer, a final encore that devolved into a 
15-minute jam with little point. 
</P>
<P>
Rock bands today can enjoy some commercial success, as the Church does, by 
doing one or two things well. But that is a small-potatoes approach, given the 
broad range of expressive possibilities in rock. 
</P>
<P>
The Blue Aeroplanes certainly keep a fruitful '60s example in mind. At times, 
the British band's 50-minute opening set sounded like a tribute to the Velvet 
Underground. But the performance had enough zest and quirky immediacy to rise 
above rehash. Singer (the term is loosely applied) Gerard Langley was more of a 
poet-actor who delivered abstract lines about romantic obsessions with 
theatrical acuity. Not only did Langley look like a younger version of Velvets 
alumnus John Cale with his short hair and shades, but his partly sung, mostly 
spoken approach echoed one of Cale's favorite dramatic vocal devices. 
</P>
<P>
While Langley acted out the lyrics, a dancer named Wojtek Dmochowski tilted and 
jerked to the rhythms like a Deadhead on fast-forward. It added color, if not 
grace, to the proceedings. Dmochowski was an ungainly Everyman who, standing in 
for the audience as a whole, let himself be overtaken by insistent music. A 
trio of guitarists was led by Angelo Bruschini, an expert at dabbing on a wide 
array of pointed, detailed textures with his hollow-bodied electric. Together, 
Bruschini, fellow lead guitarist Alex Lee and Rodney Allen recalled the deft 
interlocking and dynamic ebbs and surges of the Feelies, another band of worthy 
heirs to the Velvets' style.

TURNING NATURE INTO LANDSCAPE ART; 
</P>
<P>
CAREER: A HARVARD PROFESSOR CALLS A. E. BYE 'PROBABLY ONE OF TWO OR THREE OF 
THE LEADING LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTS SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR.'

When premier landscape architect A. E. Bye creates one of his abstract 
compositions, his palate includes the soft peaches and tans of marsh grass, the 
ambers of fall foliage, the vertical whites of birch -- juxtaposed with the 
horizontal whites of snows. Not only does he paint with these elements, he 
incorporates them into sculptures -- with the aid of bulldozers and pruning 
shears. 
</P>
<P>
Bye embraces nature in its rawest form and, through the addition and 
subtraction of various elements, transforms it into art. 
</P>
<P>
John Stilgoe, a professor of landscape history at Harvard University, calls Bye 
"probably one of two or three of the leading landscape architects since the 
Second World War. His work is one of the standards of what all landscape 
architects learn to design." 
</P>
<P>
Is Bye's work idiosyncratic? On the contrary, Stilgoe said: "He's had the 
courage, simply, to not follow the crowd. He's lived long enough to know he's 
right." 
</P>
<P>
"What you do, you bring out the essence" of the landscape, Bye said during an 
interview at his office in this wee town bordering Greenwich. "Just to give you 
an example, you come to a place where there's a lot of calligraphy of the 
branches against the sky. But there are smaller trees that are interfering with 
the visual aspect of the larger trees. So I'll remove the smaller trees, which 
haven't developed much character yet and, lo and behold, what is left over is a 
stronger statement." 
</P>
<P>
He hopes that "what I do results in a work of art." But, he quickly adds, he 
doesn't create a landscape. "The creative process is in bringing it out." 
</P>
<P>
Under Bye's direction, gyrating oak trees develop an even more erratic 
character. Fields soften. Massive rock outcroppings loom. He says he works to 
unify a site and to intensify its character through his choice of plants and by 
playing contrasts -- light and shadow, hard and soft, horizontal and vertical 
-- against each other. 
</P>
<P>
"You can have a mood as a basis for a design or a theme for a garden," he said. 
"It can be one that's grotesque, or mysterious, or serene, sublime. There's a 
picture that's malevolent," he said, singling out a photo of a bog among the 
photographs pinned to his office walls. "See? If you walk into that, you sink 
out of sight." 
</P>
<P>
He points to another photograph of a horse farm. "Here's a certain quality of 
serenity," he said. "So we can use all these adjectives." 
</P>
<P>
Bye has taught landscape architecture at the Cooper Union for the Advancement 
of Science and Art in New York City for nearly 40 years, and taught for 22 
years at Columbia University. Design projects have taken him to the 
Netherlands, the Caribbean and nearly every state east of the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed simply in a white shirt, open at the collar, slacks and penny loafers, 
he recounts events that influenced his career: stints with the Forest Service 
and the National Park Service, his early interest in photography, the 
publication of his photographic essay "Art Into Landscape, Landscape Into Art" 
(1981), and the book he is writing on the moods of landscape. A blueprint of a 
Frank Lloyd Wright house lies on a nearby drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Edwin Bye grew up in Swarthmore, Pa. His family were Quakers. Frank 
Lloyd Wright's sister, Jane Porter, was Bye's Sunday school teacher and 
neighbor. Many years later, as an adult, Bye was asked to work with Wright on 
the Reisley home in Pleasantville, N. Y. Impressed by Wright's use of native 
plants at the Fallingwater house in Mill Run, Pa., Bye incorporated that 
then-radical practice into his designs. 
</P>
<P>
Preserving the natural character of the land is a central theme in Bye's 
designs. His landscapes are often so subtly executed, so natural-looking, that 
first-time viewers often ask "What was done?" This, Bye said, is just the kind 
of response he is looking for. 
</P>
<P>
In his design of the Harvey Hubbell Co. in Orange, Conn., Bye rolled up 
sections of the forest floor -- as one rolls up sod -- unrolled them onto 
boards, transported them to the site, then slid them into place. 
</P>
<P>
Bye's has been called an "ecological aesthetic" because he so emphasizes 
natural elements -- rock, soil, native plants. "Many factors contribute to my 
vision of a landscape," Bye writes in "Art Into Landscape, Landscape Into Art." 
"But above all, the existing conditions found on a site suggest the final 
composition." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of dramatically altering a site -- turning a marsh into a pond, for 
instance -- Bye subtly shapes it until it attains a more pure form. "I'm honest 
to myself, and to the environment," he said. "It has taken me 40 years to get 
to this. Maybe not 40 years -- maybe it's 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
Bye once employed 18 people at his firm. He has designed landscapes for 
university campuses, shopping centers, schools, parks, a horse farm, religious 
institutions and many residences. He scaled his business down to just himself 
and one other architect to allow for more thoughtful attention to each 
landscape, he says. 
</P>
<P>
His primary focus today is on multiacre residences. His clients range from 
racehorse breeders to cosmetics magnates, television moguls to movie producers. 
Often, his design intent is to provide a soothing contrast to an increasingly 
industrialized world. He believes that "nature provides sustenance for inner 
being." 
</P>
<P>
Bye often draws from the simplest designs in nature to inspire his 
compositions: a rock-strewn coastline, the pattern that grass makes on snow. A 
rolling meadow in Amenia Hills, N. Y., inspired one of his favorite, and 
perhaps most recognized, techniques. "It's rather fascinating to take a flat 
lawn, which is not all that interesting and roll it up and down," he said. "And 
you see all these wonderful shadows that come across. Shadows go up and down 
with the roll of the land. And that enlivens the landscape considerably." 
</P>
<P>
How long does it take him to grasp a design idea? "Three or four seconds," he 
said with a glint in his eye. "I see just what to do immediately." He 
attributes this talent to 40 years of knowledge and experience, and a reliance 
on intuition.

NONTOXIC PEST CONTROL BECOMES BIG BUSINESS; 
</P>
<P>
EXTERMINATORS: TALLON USES NOVEL APPROACHES AND AVOIDS SPRAYING POISONS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The best way to zap termites, said exterminator Jay Tallon, is to "freeze their 
little buns off." 
</P>
<P>
That's just one of several novel ways Tallon and his brother, Joe, have devised 
to kill household pests without using poisons that may endanger pets, plants or 
homeowners. And it's become big business. 
</P>
<P>
"We have what the consumer wants today. They don't want you to go out there and 
spray toxic chemicals on everything in sight," Jay Tallon said. 
</P>
<P>
Tallon Termite &amp; Pest Control, based in Redondo Beach, has developed an 
arsenal that eschews toxic pesticides in favor of high-tech devices and 
old-fashioned common sense. 
</P>
<P>
Included are a "bug vacuum" for swooshing up spiders and other creepy crawlies, 
a steam-based "flea machine" for infested carpets, glue boards for catching 
mice and a tiny electric fence that keeps home foundations off limits to 
multiple-footed outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
The Tallons have also perfected a way to literally look inside the walls of 
homes and pinpoint where termites may be munching away. Using fiber-optic 
instruments, pest-control experts peek inside those hard-to-reach places to 
find the unwanted denizens. 
</P>
<P>
The voracious termites tend to cluster, Tallon said. Normally, they will be 
found in just a couple of walls, congregated in three or four of the timber 
support studs. 
</P>
<P>
The first step in getting rid of them is to probe with fiber-optic instruments 
to pinpoint their location. Then a dime-sized hole is drilled at the bottom of 
the wall and another at the top. Liquid nitrogen is pumped through the holes 
into the inaccessible areas, freezing the termites. 
</P>
<P>
"We freeze their little buns off," Tallon said with a grin, noting that 
termites are killed by the cold, which reaches minus-20 degrees, and not by the 
liquid nitrogen itself. 
</P>
<P>
"Termites will tell you they're 98% water," a Tallon radio ad says. "When we're 
done with 'em, they are 200% frozen. The idea is dead simple. We freeze 
termites instead of fumigate them." 
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the air humans breathe consists of nitrogen, and the freezing 
process is environmentally safe, Tallon said. When the temperature returns to 
normal, the liquid nitrogen evaporates. 
</P>
<P>
Called the Blizzard System, the eradication process is registered with the 
Environmental Protection Agency, and Tallon said the company is the only one in 
the nation using the super-cold approach for excising termites. 
</P>
<P>
But some species of termites succumb more easily to excess heat than cold, and 
the Tallons last year began marketing a companion system called the HeatWave. 
</P>
<P>
Using a convection heating system, heat strips are applied to the wood 
requiring treatment and then the electricity is turned on. About 30 minutes are 
required for the heat to penetrate to the center of the wood and reach 135 
degrees. The termites die within a minute or two. 
</P>
<P>
Tallon is applying its non-traditional, environmentally safe methods toward the 
destruction of all types of household pests, including ants, roaches, spiders, 
fleas, mice and rats. 
</P>
<P>
The company, which saw sales jump from $85,000 a month in 1987 to $700,000 per 
month this year, is expanding into the San Francisco Bay Area this summer and 
is opening offices in Florida and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to be throughout the United States over the next five years," Tallon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional method of tenting -- enclosing a home and moving everyone out 
before spraying for bugs with pesticides -- is becoming increasingly 
distasteful in this era of growing environmental awareness, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to become spray jockeys," he added. "We've started a pilot 
program for comprehensive, non-conventional pest control." 
</P>
<P>
Tallon's war on fleas features a "flea machine" that steams the carpet and 
kills the adult wingless hoppers hiding in the fibers. It also includes a 
nontoxic "birth-inhibitor" spray that prevents young insects from matriculating 
through a complete life cycle. 
</P>
<P>
Rodents get no respite from the Tallons either. The company's crews use 
electrical barriers, consisting of a single strand of wire and low-voltage 
batteries, to prevent mice, rats and roaches from coming inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
"We first exclude them from the structure," Tallon said. "We trap the ones in 
the house with mice glue boards. They have a gummy substance on them that 
attracts the mice to it, and (they) go and get stuck and they suffocate." 
</P>
<P>
Then there's the "Bugvac" for spiders. "We vacuum all the spiders up," Tallon 
said. "We go outside as well as in the home and vacuum the corners and areas 
where spiders are." 
</P>
<P>
The cost of treating a 2,000-square-foot house via the Tallon method ranges 
between $1,000 and $1,500, he said.

AUTHORS HOPING TO PRESERVE MEMORIES OF FAMILY FARMS; 
</P>
<P>
BOOKS: TWO WRITERS ARE DOCUMENTING, IN STORIES AND PHOTOGRAPHS, THE LIVES OF 
NINE DEPRESSION-ERA FARMERS.

<P>
Depression-era farmers are the last links with the sweat and joy of life on a 
small, diverse family farm, according to two people who plan to preserve those 
memories in a book called "Salt of the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to go out -- indeed, we felt compelled to go out -- and talk to 
these old guys," said one of the authors, Teresa Norris-Phillips, a free-lance 
copywriter. 
</P>
<P>
She and Candis Kelly, a graphic designer, have collected stories and 
photographs of nine Illinois farmers ages 79 to 94. 
</P>
<P>
Among them is Eli Meiss, who remembers a generation of farmers who ate the 
fruit and vegetables they grew, churned butter from the cows they milked and 
carved hams from the pigs they raised. 
</P>
<P>
"We were self-sufficient," Meiss said. "Today, a farmer's just like a poor city 
boy." 
</P>
<P>
Peter Ropp recalls kerosene lamps for light, horses for transportation and 
stoves for heat. 
</P>
<P>
"When returning from town on a cold night in a horse-drawn vehicle," Ropp said, 
"it was heartening to see the glow of the stove from the hill a half-mile south 
of home . . . a real joy on a winter night to watch the yellow and blue flames 
play after the coal was added." 
</P>
<P>
Norris-Phillips and Kelly set out in January, 1989, with tape recorder and 
camera, uncertain of how two city women would be greeted. 
</P>
<P>
"We arrived at the door thinking, 'Why would they want to tell us their life 
stories?' " Kelly recalled. "We'd walk out backward three hours later saying, 
'We really gotta go now.' " 
</P>
<P>
The women listened and looked. 
</P>
<P>
They stood atop James Yontz's tall grain bins at San Jose; they looked at the 
faint traces of stagecoach tracks at Dill Seymour's house near Seymour. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than using set questions, Norris-Phillips let the farmers reminisce and 
focus what mattered most to them. 
</P>
<P>
Meiss, born in 1905 at Fairbury, began farming at the height of the Depression 
-- in a year when drought and chinch bugs devastated his oats. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe starting in the '30s was good for us," he said. "I can't say I've ever 
lost any sleep if I had a short crop, but I'm always glad if I get more." 
</P>
<P>
During interviews for the book, Kelly watched the farmers carefully "to learn 
who they are visually," and always included their hands in her black-and-white 
portraits. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers who met with the women said they believe their stories will be 
interesting, perhaps even educational. 
</P>
<P>
"We lived in a different age," said Ropp, 84, of Normal. "It always helps to 
learn of the trials and tribulations of your ancestors -- helps people to deal 
with present-day problems."

Dictionaries have entered the age of specialization. 
</P>
<P>
The general dictionary, which has been a reference workhorse for many years, is 
being augmented by specialized dictionaries that provide information on fields 
as varied as literature, food, mathematics and banking. 
</P>
<P>
The "Dictionary of American Literary Characters" (Facts on File), for example, 
"concentrates exclusively on American Literature." Edited by Benjamin Franklin 
V, the hefty volume "spans nearly two centuries: from 1789, the date of the 
first American novel, 'The Power of Sympathy,' to 1980, when Norman Mailer's 
'The Executioner's Song' won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction." 
</P>
<P>
The book identifies, in alphabetical order, 1,100 characters from "significant 
American novels, in addition to those in some uncelebrated works and in a 
sampling of best sellers." 
</P>
<P>
For example, a look under "Ishmael" shows he was the narrator and sole survivor 
"of the Pequod's pursuit of Moby Dick in Herman Melville's 'Moby Dick.' " 
</P>
<P>
Other specialized dictionaries issued recently include: 
</P>
<P>
"Webster's New World Dictionary of Media and Communications," compiled by 
Richard Weiner. This volume's aim is "to attempt to define specifically the 
terms from the many diverse worlds of communications." For example, a 
"dingadinga" is a "low-power spotlight," while a "polecat" is "a small support 
for lamps used in studio photography." 
</P>
<P>
"Food Lover's Companion" (Barron's) by Sharon Tyler Herbst. The fat little book 
contains "comprehensive definitions of over 3,000 food, wine and culinary 
terms." A look at "chalazae" brings this definition: "Thick, cordlike strands 
of egg white which are attached to 2 sides of the yolk, thereby anchoring it in 
the center of the egg." 
</P>
<P>
"A Concise Dictionary of Mathematics" (Oxford University Press) by Christopher 
Clapham. The book is designed to "guide readers through the often bewildering 
maze of equations and theorems encountered within the mathematical world." An 
"algorithm," for example, is "a precisely described routine procedure that can 
be applied and systematically followed through to a conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
"Dictionary of Banking Terms" (Barron's) by Thomas P. Fitch. "Some 3,000 terms 
related to banking, finance and money management are listed alphabetically and 
defined." For instance, "footings" is the expression used "for the bottom line 
figure on a bank's balance sheet: total assets or liabilities, plus equity 
capital." 
</P>
<P>
"Melba Toast, Bowie's Knife &amp; Caesar's Wife: A Dictionary of Eponyms" 
(Avon) by Martin H. Manser. An eponym is defined as "a real or mythical person 
from whose name the name of a nation, institution, etc. is derived or is 
supposed to have been derived." Thus, "Ferris Wheel" comes from an American 
engineer named George Washington Gale Ferris (1859-96).

A ROLLER PAINTS FASTER, BUT PAD IS TAD CLEANER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q. When painting I've always used rollers, but friends tell me that using pads 
is easier and makes a cleaner paint job. Is that so, and if it is, why don't 
professionals use them? 
</P>
<P>
G.B., 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
A. "Pads are fairly new to the painting scene, they became popular a few years 
ago," says Jim Hawkins of Hawkins Paint in Orange. "They don't really speed up 
the process -- you're not going to complete a job any faster. However, there's 
not as much splatter with a pad. They'll spread paint very easily on flat 
surfaces, but you'll need a brush for uneven surfaces such as molding. As for 
professional painters, they probably prefer rollers because that's what they've 
used for years and because they're probably a little quicker than pads." 
</P>
<P>
Q. I've got a bolt that connects my bathroom sink to the wall that I need to 
remove. Unfortunately, it's been rounded off and it resists anything I use to 
get it out. Any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
F.K., 
</P>
<P>
Brea 
</P>
<P>
A. "You might try an 'Easy Out' reverse thread screw," says Bud Heyer of 
Fullerton Hardware. "You drill a hole in the center of the bolt, then insert 
the Easy Out, which looks like a drill bit. You then turn it in a 
counterclockwise direction and it should come out." 
</P>
<P>
Q. I've just finished remodeling our bathroom; however, I've gone through three 
wax seals for the toilet drain and I just can't get it to seal properly. Is 
there a trick to reinstalling a toilet? 
</P>
<P>
L.G., 
</P>
<P>
Tustin 
</P>
<P>
A. Maneuvering a heavy ceramic toilet into place is never easy, however, it can 
be even more difficult if your floor isn't aligned. "If you've installed a new 
floor, you've got to make sure that the toilet flange is flush with it," says 
James Scott of BJ Discount Plumbing Supplies in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
"If the floor is even a bit too high, you won't be getting a good seal. You'll 
have to modify the floor surface around the toilet so that when it's installed 
it's perfectly flush. Before setting it down, clean the flange surface and set 
the seal on top. Using two people, carefully set the toilet in place over the 
seal and floor bolts, then screw it down very evenly, maybe two turns at a 
time. Before completely tightening the nuts, sit on the seat to put weight on 
the seal, then finish tightening." 
</P>
<P>
Q. We've just bought a 30-year-old house that's passed its termite inspection 
with flying colors. However, I'd like to know if there's any way I can actually 
prevent termites from getting into my house. Is there a way I can treat wood 
myself? 
</P>
<P>
J.E., 
</P>
<P>
Trabuco Canyon 
</P>
<P>
A. The person who finds a way to prevent termite infestation will be rich. But 
for now, it may be best to leave the termite hunting to experts. "You could 
have your attic dusted with dry dye," says Jeff Vint of Vint Pest and Termite 
Control in Santa Ana. "Dry dye dries out their bodies and it's very effective. 
However, there are so many ways termites can attack your house that a simple 
dusting may not do it. 
</P>
<P>
"Probably the best thing you can do is have your house checked every year. It 
varies in price from $100 to $150 depending on the size of your house, but it's 
a worthwhile investment. Because they usually check your attic and your crawl 
space, they'll also be able to tell you about pipes you might not know are 
leaking, roof problems or defects in the wood that aren't related to termites. 
</P>
<P>
"But it's hard for the do-it-yourselfer to do much because most of the 
insecticides used for termites aren't available to the public. If you're 
building an addition, you might buy and use treated wood, and you also want to 
keep big stacks of firewood away from the house since they'll attract termites. 
Other than that, the best suggestion is the yearly inspection."

DIVIDE JOB TO CONQUER BUILDING OF A PARTITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Although the trend in home design is toward open, undivided spaces, there are 
still times when you may actually want to divide big spaces up into smaller 
ones. Building a walk-in closet is one reason. So is adding a darkroom or maybe 
a soundproof music room. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, the thing that gets the job done is the partition, a 
simple structure that any homeowner with a saw and hammer should be able to 
build. 
</P>
<P>
Before you build a partition, draw it out to scale. This will help you 
visualize the job and will make it easy to compile a shopping list for lumber. 
</P>

At the very minimum, you'll need 2-by-4 top and bottom plates, plus 2-by-4 
studs spaced every 16 inches on center. If you're framing for a door, you'll 
need two or three extra studs for the trimmers, plus a six-foot 2-by-6 and a 
scrap of half-inch plywood for the header. 
</P>
<P>
The door itself? A simple prehung flush door is the easiest to install. These 
come in a variety of widths from 18 to 36 inches. A 30-incher is a good 
all-around size. 
</P>
<P>
You'll also need a few pounds of 16-penny nails and a few pounds of eightpenny 
nails to put everything together. 
</P>
<P>
You have a choice of two ways to frame the wall. One is to assemble the whole 
thing lying flat, then stand it up and nail it in place. The other is to build 
the wall in place. Which is better? 
</P>
<P>
Building flat on the floor is usually easier. Everything is easy to reach, and 
you can nail through the plates into the ends of the studs rather than 
toenailing. But, if your walls, floor and ceiling are irregular, a preassembled 
wall may not fit properly without a lot of shimming and adjusting. Building the 
wall in place makes more sense under these conditions. 
</P>
<P>
For a flat assembly, start by marking the location of the proposed wall on the 
floor. If possible, locate the partition so you can nail the top plate into the 
ceiling joists. If this isn't possible, you'll have to cut 14 1/2-inch lengths 
of the same lumber used for the joists (usually 2-by-8 stock) and nail them in 
crosswise every 16 to 20 inches between existing joists. This will give you 
something to nail your top plate to. 
</P>
<P>
Back down on the floor, cut your top and bottom plates to length and mark off 
the positions of your studs, 16 inches on center. Keep this 16-inch interval 
constant, even if a door opening interrupts the flow. 
</P>
<P>
Next, measure your floor-to-ceiling height and subtract three inches. This 
gives you the length of your studs. Cut them all to this length and secure them 
to the top and bottom plates, using a pair of 16-penny nails through the plate 
and into each end of the stud. 
</P>
<P>
If you are framing in a door, size the rough opening 2 1/2 inches wider than 
your door and one inch higher. This will give you room to shim and adjust the 
door frame properly later on. Next, nail together a header from two layers of 
2-by-6 with a layer of half-inch plywood sandwiched between. Cut this to length 
and nail it in place with 16-penny nails. Then cut your trimmer studs to 
length, nail them in place, and finally, add the little cripples above the 
header. 
</P>
<P>
Now you can stand the wall up. Make sure the bottom plate is positioned 
properly and tack it in place with a couple of nails. If you are working on a 
concrete floor, use concrete nails. Carefully plumb the wall, using a 
carpenter's level to make sure it is dead vertical in both directions. If the 
wall is a bit short in spots, you may have to slip shims between the top plate 
and the ceiling. A piece of cedar shingle works well. 
</P>
<P>
When everything is positioned to your satisfaction, nail through the top plate 
into the ceiling joist or your previously installed blocking, and nail through 
the bottom plate into the floor. But don't nail through the section of bottom 
plate running across your door opening. Instead, saw this section out and throw 
it away. You can now install your door, and finish off with drywall or 
paneling. 
</P>
<P>
For in-place assembly, start by cutting top and bottom plates to length and 
marking them off for proper stud placement. Install the top plate first, 
nailing through it into the ceiling joists or into blocking. Once the top plate 
is in place, install the bottom plate, locating it directly beneath the top 
plate by using a plumb bob. Fasten the bottom plate in place by nailing it to 
the floor. If you will be framing in a door, do not nail the bottom plate down 
in the area of the opening. 
</P>
<P>
Once both plates are in, measure each stud individually to fit its space. 
Install the studs by toenailing with your eightpenny nails, driving in a pair 
of nails from each side of each stud, both top and bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Frame your door opening as described above. Then cut out the section of bottom 
plate spanning the door opening and you are ready to install the door and 
finish off the wall.

LILIES ADD A VARIETY OF COLORS TO THE GARDEN

One of the good standard lilies is "Black Dragon," which produces, from a 
mature bulb, a stem six feet or so with 10 or 15 white trumpets well spaced in 
a circular pattern, the outside of the flowers flushed with a more or less dark 
color. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the outside color is simply dirty-looking, sometimes reddish, but 
variable, as these lilies are seedlings, not raised from offsets or scales. The 
original plant had a decidedly dark exterior, but I noticed 25 years ago that 
some of its seedlings were handsomer than the original clone. 
</P>
<P>
A clone, by the way, is simply a group of plants identical in genetic makeup, 
whereas seedlings all vary in their genes. That is because seedlings are 
sexually produced (male pollen on female pistil) and result from a combination 
of two sets of genes. Even if a flower is fertilized with its own pollen, the 
resulting seedlings will (or may) vary widely. 
</P>
<P>
But if the plant is propagated by cuttings, offsets from the parent plant, or 
layers (part of the plant is rooted while still attached to the parent plant), 
or grown from tissue of the original plant, then the resulting plants will be 
identical. 
</P>
<P>
In lilies, or indeed any other plant, only the non-sexually propagated 
offspring are properly called by the original parental name, since they alone 
have no new genetic material introduced into them. The sexually produced 
offspring (that is, from seeds) should not really be called "Black Dragon," but 
"Black Dragon" Strain, and often such seedling strains are quite uniform 
provided the seedlings are culled -- the ones not resembling the original 
parent closely are discarded. 
</P>
<P>
Another common trumpet lily is a strain of beautiful canary yellow or deeper 
yellow flowers lumped together as "Golden Clarion" Strain. Both strains are 
excellent garden plants. The bulbs may be planted in November or April. 
</P>
<P>
Varieties of day lilies are endless, and a beginner with them should consult a 
good catalogue and choose the cheapest. The most expensive ones are all very 
well for fanatical fanciers but are quite similar to cheap varieties. 
Tremendous improvements were made in the decades following World War II, but 
advances have been less startling in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
The beginner will certainly want to plant a few pink and cantaloupe-colored 
varieties. My own preference is for those along with light lemon-colored kinds, 
but the buffs, canaries and chromes are beautiful, and so are some of the 
near-whites. The purples are admired by many gardeners and are handy for 
contrast, but as a group they are dull in effect. The reds, by contrast, are 
striking in brilliance, especially in warm climates, but in cool foggy places 
they usually are muddy-looking. They do well in the lovely warm summers of 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
I am lost in admiration again at the pink forms of a native waterlily, Nymphaea 
odorata. Of the hardy waterlilies I have tried, my favorite is one collected 
(and presumably a wild plant) by a friend in the Midwest and called "Shupac 
Pink." Today mine had six open flowers of rich sparkling pure pink, unclouded 
and vibrant. From time to time I prod my friend to introduce this plant 
commercially. There are other pink variants of the wild odorata that are almost 
as beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
For the second year an allegedly hardy palm, said to pull through winters in 
Zone 6, has begun flowering with me. It is Rhapidophyllym histrix, with 
fan-shaped leaves. My plant is about waist high, and I am cautious when weeding 
near it, as the trunk has sharp spines. The flowers resemble a fist-size fuzzy 
grayish-tan mop, starting almost at ground level. Later the pea-size seeds are 
borne in a densely fuzzy cluster about a foot high. I have had no success 
growing any from seed. I gave some to another palm enthusiast and hope he has 
had good results. 
</P>
<P>
For the past five or six weeks my favorite large-flowered clematis has been 
blooming, "Perle d'Or." It has only four petals, or segments, and is not very 
large as clematis go, just covering the palm of the hand. They are 
lavender-blue, and in the garden a sheet of these flowers will give a 
distinctly blue effect. I saw this clematis once in a village garden in East 
Anglia, and was not surprised that one of the world's leading commercial 
growers used that particular plant on the cover of his catalogue. I now know 
that "Perle d'Azur" naturally makes sheets of bloom. It does not repeat in late 
summer or fall. It blooms once a year and shuts up shop. 
</P>
<P>
From the commercial grower I received a few plants of petunias called 
"Primetime" and have found them exceptionally good-natured and showy. My own 
favorites are the virtually wild petunias in off-white, off-pink and 
off-lavender that you find growing sometimes in alleys or in cracks in a 
sidewalk or curb. Those are beautifully perfumed at night. 
</P>
<P>
But the two sorts of "Primetime" that I grow are lavender-pink with a darker, 
almost red star in the center, and a solid shocking pink kind. I grow them 
together and they are more free-blooming than any petunias I have seen. They do 
not run about but remain clumpy and the flowers touch, concealing the leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Through carelessness I planted them near two old day lilies, the melon-pink 
"Okay" and the yellow, dark-eyed "Nashville." "Nashville" is quite a rare 
color, a kind of saturated buff, so distinct that once seen it is always 
recognizable. "Okay" is, I suppose, out of commerce and is a routine flower. I 
always liked it because it so strongly resembled another day lily, "Frankly 
Fabulous," which was popular at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, the strange strident pink colors of the petunias with the day lilies 
and a few wild blue tradescantias are fine together. They are all beside water 
troughs containing small pink and yellow waterlilies. 
</P>
<P>
For a time I was not sure what to do with these horse troughs, as their 
galvanized steel exteriors strike me as ugly. They are two feet deep and sit 
atop the ground. In the past I have sometimes enclosed them in brick and I have 
seen them enclosed in wooden planks. While thinking what to do the birds solved 
the matter by dropping seed of the Boston ivy, which quickly covers every inch 
of the exterior. When it tries to send shoots into the water, I whack it back.

BILL BURRUD; HOST OF TV ANIMAL PROGRAMS

<P>
Bill Burrud, the child actor who grew up to produce and host "Animal World" and 
other popular television travel, adventure and animal programs, has died. He 
was 65. 
</P>
<P>
Burrud died Thursday night at his Sunset Beach home after a heart attack. 
Earlier Thursday he was in the Huntington Harbour offices of his Bill Burrud 
Productions, working on a one-hour special for Disney's cable Discovery Channel 
called "Sea Mammals." 
</P>
<P>
"I love it; I eat it up," Burrud had said of his work in a Los Angeles Times 
interview in 1983. "I won't quit until I go to the great tube in the sky, as 
they say." 
</P>
<P>
Born Jan. 12, 1925, in Hollywood, the son of an early travelogue filmmaker, 
Burrud was destined for a life before the camera. He made his stage debut at 
the age of 7 in the road show, "Music in the Air," and acted in 28 movies, 
ranging from "The Cowboy and the Kid" to "Captains Courageous." 
</P>
<P>
Giving up acting when he entered junior high school, Burrud graduated from 
Hollywood High School, majored in business administration at USC, and served as 
an officer on the destroyer Coolbaugh during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
His first post-war job was on Santa Ana radio station KVOE where he sold air 
time to sponsors and created a weekly fishing program, interviewing fishermen 
at Port Orange, now the site of the Balboa Bay Club. 
</P>
<P>
Burrud edged into television by creating weekly travelogues for KTTV, filming 
29 Palms or Death Valley or some other scenic place on his wind-up 
16-millimeter movie camera. 
</P>
<P>
In 1954, he formed his production company, going on to produce and host more 
than 800 half-hour episodes in 14 series about travel, adventure or wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1950s and early 1960s, Burrud hosted and produced up to five live 
television shows a week -- in series such as "True Adventure," "Vagabond," 
"Wanderlust" "and "Islands in the Sun." He gave Los Angeles' KCOP-TV Channel 13 
a reputation as the "travel-adventure station." 
</P>
<P>
He also became known as a champion of endangered animals. In 1974, Burrud 
produced a one-hour special called "Where Did All the Animals Go?" which he 
made available free to television stations around the country as a fund-raiser 
for Kenya's Tsavo National Park. Burrud always rated it one of the most 
rewarding projects of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Burrud's "Animal World" ran from 1968 to 1976, and he narrated "Safari to 
Adventure" from 1969 to 1975. His "Animal Odyssey" still runs Sundays and his 
"New! Animal World" runs daily on the Discovery Channel. 
</P>
<P>
Among Burrud's other series were "World of the Sea," "Assignment America," "The 
American West" and "The Wonderful Women of the World." 
</P>
<P>
Although his company remained small by Hollywood standards, it has registered 
steady success for nearly four decades. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always tried to emulate, in a small way, what Disney has done in a large 
way," Burrud once said. "What we're trying to do is give as much entertainment 
as possible, and entertainment with a warmth in it." 
</P>
<P>
Burrud is survived by his wife, Marlene, and four sons, John, Bob, Gary and 
Tom.
